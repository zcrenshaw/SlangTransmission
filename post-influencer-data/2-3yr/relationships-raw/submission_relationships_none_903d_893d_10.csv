"Me [17F] with my step family, moving into their house which is no wheelchair accessible.


*NOT

My dad is marrying his girlfriend of 2 years, Cindy and she has 2 kids which means that we will be moving into their house soon. Her house is much larger and in a great spot between the schools that my brother and I attend and her children attend. Our house is small but its just the 3 of us and is already set up for my wheelchair, open concept, ramps etc. The problem is her house isn't and there has been no effort made to do so.

It is a ranch style home with no large steps but the front and back doors have a bump which is very difficult to get my chair over, often I need someone to push/life me over. The 2 bathrooms are very small and have no support bars or room for my chair, I can go alone but its VERY difficult and timely.  The flooring in between rooms is bumpy, very narrow hallways etc. I can barley reach the kitchen sink unless I put my brakes and lift myself up to wash my hands, the cabinets are high up I need someone to get me dished down etc

Minor accommodations can be made to fix some of these issues but there will need to be big ones like the bathroom but there has been no attempt and we are moving in a month or two. My father idolizes Cindy. She is the love of his life and I feel he puts her first but that could just be me. He is a great father to us and always has been, when our mom died and he was alone for so long until Cindy came. She isn't much of a ""mother"" but she is nice person and seems friendly enough when she is around us but my brother and I feel like we are slowly being pushed out of the family and replaced by Cindy and her two children, they seem to dictate what we do, where we go, always something that want etc.

Dad argues that we had him for years growing up and since we are both adults the younger kids need him more then we do. Which is fine I'm moving out next Sept 2018 for college anyways and its nice to see my dad finally happy.
The problem is until then I will be living in Cindys house and I keep telling them they need to make changes but nothing has been done. They don't want to do all the repairs because her house is already really nice and it could be pricey renovations. Like redoing a bathroom just for me when i move out in a year.

But I already struggle when I'm there, I need someone to help me constantly. I can barley use the bathroom without it fearing I'm doing to fall or get stuck. Im not sure how to approach this or maybe I should just move out early on my own..

  
  **tl;dr**: Moving into my step mom's house, it is not wheelchair friendly and there have been no attempts made to do so. I struggle but feel I am pushed to the side and viewed as high maintenance.

Sorry it took so long to update you!

First of all, thanks for all the advice. Since it was the first time this happened to me in such a blunt way, I tried to handle it the best I could, but I was kind of lost about what to do. So thanks again, your advices really helped me.

Following your advices, I got home yesterday, asked my wife to sit down and told her what was going on. I showed her all the messages and explained to her in details what happened.

She was really concerned, didn't get mad or anything, she was just worried that - using her words -, ""that bitch would ruin your carreer and stress you out"".

So I told her I would talk to my boss and the HR next day, and so I did.

I arrived earlier, scheduled the meeting with HR and my boss (he went pale went I told him I'd like to talk with him and HR together - later he said he thought I would quit, haha!).

I sat down with them, asked them to be prepared for a mexican soap opera, and them showed them all the messages and explain to them all that happened.

I told them I'd like her to be moved to another desk, and that I trusted them to discipline her, so she would stop harassing me.

They listen very quietly, nodding between the sentences and doing quick question when in doubt.

After I finished telling my tale they said they would call her in to talk and address the subject, and that I could rest assured they would take all reasonable measures.

I went back to my desk, got to work (I was going on a business trip to Ciudad de Mexico following week, so I'm pretty busy), then I heard the BSCC phone (short for bat-shit-crazy-coworker) ring. She looked at me with suspicious on her eyes when she got up and went to talk to the HR, I tried to avoid eye contact and didn't express anything.

One hour later she comes back crying, get her purse and leave.

Everybody in the office was ""wtf just happened?"". My boss then call me into his office and told me what happened.

They told her I told them what was going on, then she made a whole dramatic shit show, telling she was in love with me and was fighting for what she thought was right, etc etc etc.

My boss and the HR person dismissed her silly arguments and told her she would need to keep things professional and move to another desk, otherwise they would have rescind the work contract.

And she prefered to get fired, so from now on she no longer works with me.

It has been 2 weeks and so far nothing related to the subject happened, so I guess my life is back the way I like it: just peace and quiet.

So, thanks again for all advices! I think my thoughts were kind of clouded by this shit, you guys made me think clearly, so thanks!

---

**tl;dr:** Told my wife, she was awesome. Told boss and HR, they were awesome. Crazy bitch was fired, which is awesome. I have my life back: peace and quiet.

---

**Edit:** I know this subreddt only allow one update, and I waited 15 days to post this, but this is important so I guess an Edit won't hurt anyone. Mods, please let me know if this is not cool.

Just got a call from her husband. Apparently she was crying all weekend and told him on monday why she was fired. 

He told he didn't buy her version of the facts, since the contradict herself in several points of her story.

He told he called the company to clarify what happened, and now was calling me just to make sure. 

I told him everything and offered to show him the messages. We are going to meet in an hour in a coffee next to the office.

He sounded hurt, but very clear minded.

Just told my boss, HR and my wife that I'm going to meet him, and my boss offered to go with me.

Man, I'm surrounded by good people.

**Edit2:** Just came back from the meeting with her husband. It was all very quickly.

I arrived with my boss, he was waiting for me. I just showed him the messages in my phone, answer some questions about what happened, and that was it. He said he just wanted to be sure, 'cause she deleted all of her messages.

He said this was not the first time something like that happened and apologized for everything. 

He said she was seeing a psychologist in the past, but she had stopped going recently.

I just said I didn't want nothing to do with it, that I came to meet him just to make clear I didn't want any of this to happen, wished him the best and left.

He just nodded and apologized again as I left.

I'm surprised with his reaction. Maybe he doesn't seem to be angry because they passed through something similar before, I don't know and really don't care. I'm just had enough drama and I'm glad this wasn't another one.

So, let's hope this is the end.

Thanks for your support and advice on this."

"Me [57M] with my PhD student [20sF]: I am concerned she is suffering from anorexia. How can I help her?


""Katie"" has been my PhD student for nearly a year now (I am her supervisor). Katie is a great student; she is very responsible, hard-working, and reliable. I have no concern with her academic capabilities, but rather her health.


At the start of her PhD, Katie looked fairly healthy (140lbs at 5'8""). As the months went on, I noticed she was looking thinner and thinner. I attributed this to stress, as her PhD program is demanding. Currently, Katie is extremely gaunt. I would estimate she is 85lbs at 5'8"". Whenever we have lab meetings that include lunches, Katie states that she has already eaten and refuses to eat. If other lab members pester her, she will eat and then disappear to the bathroom for 20-30 minutes.


I am concerned about Katie's health, but I am unsure if it is my place to say anything. She meets all my requirements when it comes to her school work. She gets all her work done before deadlines, and her work is of high quality. She appears lethargic all the time and I see her struggle, but her alleged illness does not interfere with her work (yet).


My question to Reddit is: How can I approach Katie about her health? She is rather quiet and reserved, and none of her lab peers are close with her. She is also very professional, so I would not describe our supervisor-student relationship as ""friends"".

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [32 M] dating 5 years, found a mystery apartment key and fob on his desk.


Throwaway because his friends know my main account.

I'll try to keep this brief, but a little backstory is needed to justify my concern.

I've been dating my current SO for around 5 years, been living with him for 3. So far, our relationship has been great, save for a bump in the road we hit in November. 

He'd stepped out to answer a phone call, and had left Skype open on his laptop. Normally, I'm not a suspicious person at all, but for some reason while walking by it, I felt the need to glance over at the open chat window. In his contact list were just the names of his business partners and a friend or two that I knew, but at the bottom there was a woman's name I didn't recognize. So, against all better judgement, I clicked on it.

Turns out, it was a woman in China who he had been having extremely explicit conversations with for the better part of a year. She had been sending him pictures of herself in various bras/ nothing at all, while he provided commentary, sending her all sorts of compliments I'd certainly never received from him. I didn't scroll far enough up to see how long it'd been going on; I just packed up a few things and disappeared to a friend's house for a couple of days. He, of course, was incredibly remorseful, and begged to reconcile. After a very long, emotional, and apologetic conversation, I decided to forgive him with the caveat that we work on our relationship. He deleted her off of Skype, allowed me to look through his computer whenever I felt the need, etc. 

This brings me to today. My SO is currently away on business, so I've been puttering around our apartment cleaning and dusting. Well, I was dusting his desk, and sitting there is a key with a very fancy silver fob attached, from an apartment rental service I'd never heard of before (it definitely was not from our apartment, that's for sure). I Googled the company, and they offer apartments everywhere from about an hour away, to across the country (one of the provinces was somewhere he'd been recently on a business trip). Since they only offer residential apartments, there's no way it could belong to any of the sub-contracting companies he's been interfacing with over the last couple of months. 

I know it's possible there's a logical explanation for this, but due to the past history, I'm having a hard time coming up with one. 

I sent him a Skype message earlier today, asking him about his trip, then bringing up the fact that I'd found a key/fob, and was wondering what it was for. He has not yet responded.

Am I just being paranoid? Is this something to worry about? Is there an explanation I'm just not seeing here? Why would he leave it lying around if it would incriminate him for something?!

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

"Me [30F] with my husband [32 M] 3 years. I just found out I was the other woman in my husbands first marriage


When I met my now husband he told me he was in the middle of a divorce...which I found out this week was not completely the truth.  He wasn't in the middle of a divorce the divorce hadn't even started. But there was a break in their marriage because he had moved out 4 months prior to us ever meeting, so when I met him he was what appeared to be a man living alone, while trying to iron out all the complications of a divorce. They had a kid together so it also seemed logical that he was in contact with his ex during this time, and spending time at the house. Turns out she was still under the impression that their marriage was intact, that the move out was just him needing some space for the time being and he strung her along for those 4 months he was living on his own, as well as an additional 2, almost 3 months, into our relationship. They would make plans together (he would cancel last minute because he was with me) She would try desperately to be a good wife to him (probably hoping he'd come back) send him I love you text...to which he'd respond back with a ""love you too"" or the dreaded ""luv ya"" She'd offer to make him breakfast before work or dinner after work to get him to come by the house...sometimes he would go most of the time he wouldn't. He was pretty much using her while he tried to figure out what he wanted. And there were other things like we took a weekend trip about a month in, and had one of the best weekends ever, we still talk about it to this day...and he had sent her flowers during that trip. Probably because of his guilty cheating conscious. 

Well one day social media does what social media tends to do and it got him caught up. He never used Facebook but did have an account, which made him tag-able. We went on a trip with his friends and during that trip his friend tagged him in photos of us together, his mom commented on the photo pretty much calling him a POS for what he was doing to his family. I was like WHOA...what am I mixed up in? He had told me before his family had turned on him and did not approve of his divorce so he had pretty much cut them out of his life, so again I had a reason as to why his mom was so irate over seeing him with someone else. And again, divorce is messy so none of it seemed that suspicious. Well it turns out that was the incident that actually ended his marriage, because THAT is when his ex actually filed for divorce. 

Finding all of this out actually made things much more clear for me, I was always treated like I broke up their marriage but I always thought I had nothing to do with it, from my perspective they were done months before I ever met him and were just handling legal things. That was not that case. 

So here is my dilemma now, what do I do with this information? There is:
1) do nothing, it was so long ago, there is nothing to gain from it. We have such a great marriage and relationship, what's the point? I was really mad when I found out and now I don't know how I feel. I,too, have been in limbo in a relationship, where things are done but you're too scared to pull the trigger, so you just end up being a shitty person till the other party has had enough of you.

OR

2) Bring it up. He was technically cheating on me too. There are so many moments in the beginning that are now tainted or would have never been had I known the truth. I would never disrespect another woman or a marriage like that, and yet I did. And because of the position he put me in, I had to take years of being treated like scum by his family. And I also wonder, had he not got caught, how long would that have gone on?

I love my niece to death. I've been a presence in her life since my brother and his husband adopted her as an infant, and they have always been glad to let me hang out with her. I babysit, take her to the park, we have girls days, I visit whenever, she actually asks to call me if I'm busy and haven't been able to see her for a while. 


We all live in the same town, but in different houses. My mom spends time with her too and the 3 of us have spent plenty of time together. But the other night she actually came knocking on my door, telling me that I spend way too much time with *her* granddaughter, that my niece preferred my company to hers because I spoiler her (I have no idea what this means), she had rights as a grandma, etc. I don't know what spurred this and she didn't respond when I asked. She said it was time we made a visitation chart, in which she got to see her more because she was the adult and it was HER granddaughter. I was stunned and apologized and she left. The more I think about it though, I don't know what this means. I'm second-guessing myself, wondering if my brother and BIL actually are bothered by me. What do I even do?

For her birthday we thought a nice gift would be a round trip plane ticket. She could choose the date and we'd take care of the cost. We're lucky that we've been able to save up enough for this. We sent the offer in a birthday card. 

I waited, and then I waited some more, worried that it had gotten lost(totally plausible) I sent her a message. Didn't get anything back so I sent another one. She finally answered and thanked me for the card, no mention of what I had written inside. So I asked what she thought of the message inside. All I got back were the words ""I need to think about it"". It's been a week now, I can't get ahold of her.

I am absolutely destroyed at the moment.  My initial reaction was the immediate onset of a panic attack.  Luckily I have had a few in the past and knew that eventually I would be okay and able to breathe again.  

The attack lasted about 2 hours, with it ending just before typing out this post.  I am not sitting here completely numb.  I saw no signs of this coming, I mean NONE.  Our day went well she left in the morning for work, she worked the day shift, and I worked at night.  I got off a bit earlier than expected, she had just sent me a message saying she was excited for our day off tomorrow together. 

She had said if I was off early she would be cutting the night short to come spend some time with me. Once I came home I gave her a calll to see if this was still the plan.  She said she was going to to go to a friends, I asked if I should come meet them somewhere.  She responding by saying ""No, I don't want that"".  Red flag.  The conversation was then full of unenthused answers, to any of my questions.  I asked if something was up, did not hear a response,  repeated my question, no response again.  She just wanted to get off the phone. I made a mistake and asked if she wanted to tell me something, no answer, so I asked the ultimate question.  ""Are you breaking up with me?""  Her response ""Yes"". Me ""for real?"".  Her ""Yes, I don't know.""   

The panic attack started, I told her about it. She didn't seem to care. Haven't heard from her since her one response "" Staying at my friend _____'s house"".

"Me [30F] with my boyfriend of 5 years [29M] texting his married coworker [25F], I snooped in his phone and don't know where to go now. Please help.


Ok so here goes, this may be a long one. My boyfriend and I live in a fairly remote location, we have been together for 5 years (lived together for 4) and don't really have any friends, couple friends or otherwise. He has a few male friends in town he hangs out with and I'm mostly a loner but it's ok. For the story ME= me, BF= boyfriend (obvious sorry), and CW=cheating wife.

A little over a year ago, BF got a new coworker, a young mother, married to a guy he knew from high school. For the first 3 months they worked together, I knew nothing about her, then BF told me we were invited to her place for a party. It wasn't a party, just us and them and their kid. It sparked a small friendship between CW and I. But BF would always act weird whenever CW and I would hang out. 

Then came the day that CW told me how she nearly cheated on here husband and had an extensive emotional affair with a coworker at her previous job and how she was forced to leave said job by her husband because of the emotional/nearly physical affair. Now CW works with my BF. This story came straight from CW mouth and made me instantly have ill feelings towards her. 

We hung out as a group a few more times, most notable was the night we all hung out and got drunk. The second her husband went upstairs for bed, CW leaned her back against my BF's knee for the next 45 minutes until I insisted we leave. 

About 6 months after this incident, I had basically stopped hanging out and talking to CW at this point. We picked her up from the airport about 4 hours away from where we live. No way was BF going alone to get her, so I got stuck with a crappy roadtrip. CW had gone home for a month to visit her family, she did not reach out or text me once during her time away. But the entire roadtrip home from the airport every sentence out of her mouth was ""Oh BF, did you get this message or picture I sent you?"" My blood was boiling. And I demanded BF give up the friendship. He refuses. 

This has continued, he doesn't see her that I know of, but texts her on the regular and works together far to often for my tastes. Three days ago I broke, his phone went off constantly all night, so after he checked the messages in the morning, I took his phone while he showered. Input the password and read our demise. 

The messages are so unfair to me. They are clearly in a text relationship. Every other message is about how one misses the other. Cute pictures back and forth, constant updates on how the others day is. Funny things, silly things, a perfect text relationship. 

Something I had tried to have with BF since the beginning of our time together. I used to text him I missed him after not seeing him for a day, I'd get told that a day is not long enough to miss someone. I used to send him silly pictures, I got told I was just wasting his data, and I can show him when he sees me. Worse yet, I used to try to tell him my day and he just wouldn't respond. BF and I barely text, we really only use it to find out if the other needs something from the store. 

So after reading through his text relationship with CW, I am heartbroken. BF always told me he wasn't good at the cute things in relationships, hates texting and doesn't do it much. None of that seems true, just true about me. 

It all makes me feel like I'm not good enough, like he doesn't truly want to be with me, not if he is good at being exactly what I am craving but with CW. Not me. 

So do we break up? He threatens to break up with me every time I speak ill of CW. But he also still says he loves me. But also refuses to discuss future plans. 

I just need advice, has anyone ever been in this situation? Would you just pack up and leave? There are so many things I still love about him, so many ways we fit, but these stupid little things that have been missing since the beginning for me, are really really hurtful being seen happening with CW. She's freaking married, let her own husband miss her...I just want BF to miss me sometimes.

TL:DR- BF has had a text relationship with a married coworker for over a year, snooped and read the messages, he has the perfect relationship on paper with her, refuses to be the same way with me. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thank you ALL!! This blew up and I don't think I've ever seen so many redditors agree! Thank you for your clarity, for your kind words and for making me feel way less crazy.

Reddit, guys, I really need some advice here.

They fought for custody of my brother [17 M] and I, and since I was the oldest I was constantly put in the middle. I went a long time thinking my dad was a terrible person for all the things my mom told me he did, and I hated him for a while. 

My senior year of highschool, I found out my mom was pretending to be me on my Facebook account, talking to a woman who had taken my senior pictures for my dad and telling her I didn't like them, didn't have fun taking them and didn't want to be tagged in them (because she only wanted Facebook to see the pictures she had taken, not my dad's). This woman was pretty hurt and had no idea it wasn't actually me saying these things. I immediately texted her and told her that was a fucked up thing to do, and changed my password since she violated my privacy and pretended to be me. She reacted by taking all of my money out of my bank account for a made up debt I now suddenly owed her, and I went home, packed up all my stuff, and moved to my dad's.

This made me spiral into a depression, because I had realized i'd spent most of my life thinking my dad was awful and my mom never did anything wrong and didn't deserve any of it, but after that I realized she was pretty messed up too, and I didn't know who to believe anymore. I couldn't wait to turn 18 and move away so I wouldn't be a part of their drama anymore, and could love them both from a distance.  

Fast forward to now, I now live 1,000 miles away from my parents. I decided to forgive all past transgressions on both sides so I could have good relationships with them both, separate from each other, and my mom never understood this despite my trying to explain it. My mom would continue to try and tell me things my dad did to hurt her and my brother, and I've told her several times that I have zero interest in anything that goes on between them and not to talk to me about it. As far as i'm concerned, when i'm talking to my mom, my dad doesn't exist, and vice versa. (It's important to note that not once has my dad ever told me anything my mom had done, and doesn't mention her, ever.)

**Current Situation:**

My dad is finally able to come and visit me next week for the first time since moving here 2.5 years ago. During the time he'll be here, my brother will be turning 18. The plan was for my dad, brother, and step mom to all come visit for a couple days. I didn't mention it to my mom because I figured she already knew and there was no reason for me to mention it to her anyway.

Yesterday I got a text from my mom that read:
&gt; ""So, not one soul told me about this trip to (state) for (brother's) birthday. Not only did I have no idea I wouldn't get to spend my son's 18th bday with him at all.....but we made plans to go see Jeff Dunham in (another city) that night so he could spend the day with dad. I'd prefer it if you stayed at dad's when you come visit in May (for my brother's graduation). I'm not doing this anymore.""

So, my initial reaction is: wtf? 
After talking to my brother, it seems he forgot to tell my dad he had made plans with my mom, so my dad, thinking there were no other plans in the way, decided to come and visit me and take my brother so he could see me, too. He bought everyone plane tickets. 

This is what I sent back to my mom:
&gt; ""Idk why you're mad at me. I didn't know you had plans with him and I didn't know that you didn't know he was coming here. It's not my responsibility or place to tell you things like that. It's not my fault (brother) forgot to tell dad about your plans and it's not my fault that you and dad can't communicate with eachother efficiently so that this entire situation could have been avoided. Now (brother's) upset that he's letting everyone down and i'm upset that somehow i'm STILL being thrown into the middle of shit that doesn't have anything to do with me even when i'm 1,000 miles away. We will stay with one of our friends in May.""

After my mom flipped out, my brother told my dad he wasn't going to see me anymore since he felt bad that he made plans with mom first and forgot about them, my dad called me to tell me my brother wasn't coming and he honestly had no idea why he wasn't coming. 

My brother listened to my mom on the phone with one of her friends, and from the way she was talking, she truly believes that I knew that she didn't know about the trip, and that she's convinced herself that my dad planned this all out just to fuck with her and make her not see my brother for his ""very important"" birthday. She told my brother directly that I ""attacked her"" in that text message. After all this, my brother decided to come on the trip. He said ""i felt bad for her because I fucked up, but if she's going to slander you and dad then she doesn't deserve it.""

And now we come to the true problem. This is the next and last thing she's said to me so far, and I have no idea how to respond or go forward from here.

&gt;""The FACT that you are still blind to what he is doing &amp; his motives is literally astounding to me. &amp; yea it does have to do with you because you keep allowing him to use you to hurt me.

&gt;WHY would he make plans for an 18 year olds bday &amp; not ask him what he wants to do &amp; where he wants to go?! Who does that?! And never say a word?!!

&gt;No one thinks it's strange to go to (my state) just weeks before you are coming here? No one? (Brother) would rather go to New York or someplace he hasn't been. But instead of discussing it with his now adult son, he makes his own plans with his own agenda

&gt;I won't believe for one second it never crossed your mind it was weird.

&gt;(Brother) should be upset! Upset he is being used as a pawn at 18 years old without his permission!!!

&gt;Just like you allow him to use you. I send (brother) over there for all the holidays, mine or not! I went out of my way to ask (brother) what he wanted to do for his birthday &amp; made sure dad also had time with him! I don't behave the way ya'll do!!
And this is it!!
I went over there to see you in Sept. &amp; I've never felt more unwanted &amp; unwelcome anywhere in my entire life

&gt;But i'm SURE dad won't feel that way when he is there. You'd NEVER treat him like that.

&gt;You honestly think had (brother) been given the options he would have wanted this?! Absolutely not.

&gt;The game is still being played, &amp; i'm the one being hurt &amp; YES.....you ARE still allowing it. So stop lying to yourself. You don't care

&gt;No reason to worry anymore, we haven't been close in the last year anyway. 

&gt;I'm fine.
Enjoy""


Reddit.

I think my mom is crazy.

Literally all of this is in her head and none of it is happening. My dad made a plan to come see me, made sure it was ok with me and my boyfriend, and asked my brother if he wanted to come. My brother said yes, forgetting all about his plans with my mom, and so my dad bought plane tickets. 

When my mom came in September, she didn't ask but instead told me she had bought tickets. When she was here, she somehow got it in her head that I was mad at her, and despite me trying to assure her that I wasn't mad, she acted like a child, refused to believe me, and stayed in our guest room the entire rest of the time she was here, which was like 2 days. I made efforts to try and invite her to go put put or bowling or anything at all, and she would decline and stay in the room. Then went home and cried that I had treated her like shit and didn't want her there. 

Idk what to do. Idk how to respond. My mom always makes herself the victim, no matter what it is. I was depressed and cutting myself? No, I was faking it just to hurt her. I was quiet at lunch because I was tired and had a lot on my mind? No, I hate her and don't want her to be here.

I'm pretty hurt that she thinks I would intentionally conspire with my dad to hurt her, especially since I've told her over and over I don't want anything to do with what goes on between them bc I mentally could not handle it anymore.

What should I do, reddit? The only response I can think of is ""you're crazy, get some help"" But somehow I don't think that'll go over too well.

**- Edit**

I woke up to a long text about how she feels.

--She says my father and I ""stole her son's 18th birthday from her, after she's spent years fighting to not miss one (They fought over full custody the whole time - she says she was fighting for equal custody, and he wanted full with no visitation. I believed this growing up.) ""Then legally have been forced to miss more than any parent should ever have to.""

--Then she talks about how when my brother was born she was under ""nightmare conditions"" because she had just found out my dad had an affair (unsure if it was emotional or physical) and even though she was mad at him, she still allowed him to be in the room when his son was born, because she ""chose not to deny him the birth of his son even though he didn't deserve to be in there and had every right not to allow him"" And says how she never denied him the right to his children. Then that child grew up, reached his big 18 milestone and it was stolen from her not only by him, but ""by the daughter who spent years of her life watching her mother go through enormous pain &amp; sacrifice... it's a betrayal I never saw coming.""

--She goes on to say more about how I should have known that she didn't know, and won't believe I didn't. How she would never do this to my dad, and that my dad isn't even planning this trip for my brother, he's planning it to hurt her, and doesn't care about my brother's birthday. She says my dad and step mom go on vacations all the time, so why didn't they bring my brother on those instead of this one, when I was already going to see them next month anyway? 

--She says I could have told him it wasn't a good time to go. (It was a great time for my dad and my boyfriend and I, plus I was happy to be able to spend a birthday with my brother who I haven't spent a single ""so important"" birthday with in years.) and I ""could have done what you did to me when I've tried to go up there"" (I told her no, it wasn't a good time.) But instead, I chose sides and hurt her. Choices have consequences, and now the consequence is our relationship. Dad's goal has finally been obtained: taking her kids away. 

I decided to respond, told her I would only say one more time that I wasn't a part of some plan that doesn't exist, and that I was sorry that she felt as though we stole something from her, but the reality is that, that isn't the case. I told her she wasn't entitled to our birthdays or anything in our lives since we are both now adults, and the day is about him, anyway. I told her about how she acted when she was here, and that her constant victim playing is exhausting and I'm concerned for her. I told her I loved her, that I wanted the best for her, and when she was ready to let go of the past and move on, and can stop making everything about hurting her, then she could call me. She's the only thing standing in the way of her happiness.

She sent 2 more long messages (we don't really talk on the phone much. Neither of us ever call the other). The first one saying how it's amazing how we're the only ones who think this, but all her friends ""see the truth"". She even had to go sit with her pastor because she was so heart broken and even he told her it wasn't right. It seems my brother told her that he thought she knew about the trip, didn't realize the timing of the days, and forgot that I would be here for his graduation. She says this is my dad's manipulation. She's not gonna explain anything to me anymore because it's clear that I view her so negatively, and view my father so highly (To be fair, guys, my dad put myself and all of my things outside for my mom to pick up because they thought I was my mom's spy, and I bought into what my mom was saying and didn't like my father. We didn't talk for a yearish after that.) She says I don't love her, I know what love looks like because she's demonstrated unconditional love to me my entire life, and this isn't it. I'm lying to myself and i'll regret this forever. 

The next one calls me heartless for talking about my problems and not having empathy for her own. She says how she went through so much with her mom abusing her, fighting with my dad during and after both pregnancies, have that same man spend years trying to take her kids from her, then her daughter grows up to be just like him. She's been in more counseling hours than I could imagine, dedicated her life to Christ because it's the only way she wouldn't have ended her life years ago, and that I know nothing about true depression. I know nothing about her except what I chose to believe. She asks how I could call her a victim, that sounds like my step mom. She has many friends who've seen things with their own eyes and wouldn't call her a victim. I've placed misplaced blame on her for my own pain growing up because her only other option was to give us up and that was never an option for her. I abuse her because it somehow makes me feel better about myself. She doesn't allow pain to turn her into someone who hurts those who hurt her, including how I treated her while she was here. I'm blind to who I am. I never send so much as a card for holidays (I got her a birthday present, and mother's day card, and a Christmas present last year, as well as a call for thanksgiving. I don't participate in any other holiday.) but she sends me all kinds of things for all holidays, never let a single one go uncelebrated. But this is how I feel, since she has no right to be in my life &amp; this is how I treat her after she moved me to (snowy state) in the dead of winter (I originally wasn't planning on taking her up for my move, and could have easily done it without her company, but decided to invite her because I knew she was sad I was leaving), then that's fine. No more relationship for us. She loves me as her daughter, but doesn't like who I am and won't allow that in her life. This is how a nonvictim behaves. She prays for me, and says ""I pray that you always know how much you are loved even when everyone around you is telling you all the reasons why you aren't loveable"" Until the healing of God brings us together again, she releases me.

I'm not going to respond, I guess. I'm sad to know she isn't going to be a part of my life anymore, but at the same time I can't deal with this shit. I hope one day she figures out that she's the problem.

"My dad (70M) is not speaking to me (24F) over a tattoo


My dad's visiting me from out of town.  We're pretty close, get along well.

I have two small tattoos, one on my ankle and one inside my elbow. My dad hates tattoos so I've been wearing a long sleeve and long jeans around my house even though I live in the desert and it's ~80 degrees. This morning I went to grab some laundry and had shorts on; he saw my small ankle tattoo. He couldn't even see what the tattoo was from that far away but was immediately livid and wouldn't even talk to me. He went outside to mess around with his car and I asked what he was up to today. He said he couldn't even talk to me and that he's so pissed off, that I'm trashy and that he has nothing to say to me. I pointed out that me having a tattoo affects his life in no way, and he responded that he's entitled to an opinion. True, but I don't see how what I put on my body is in any way personally offensive to his life.

I went to work this morning and just got home (7PM) and he isn't here, hasn't texted. Probably hanging out with his buddies in the next town but normally sends a text at least. I think his behavior is dramatic, I'm 24 years old and a graduate student, it's not like I'm covered in tacky tattoos and have no future. I have no idea how he'll act when he gets back to my house. I'm irritated that I have to feel stressed about this idiocy and roast in hot clothing in my own home. Also, I'd like to have a nice visit with my dad without him ruining it over something I see as 100% insignificant. I feel like he's entitled to disagree with me having a tat, but I don't think it's fair for him to act like I somehow wronged him.

Any advice?

EDIT: Dad just came back to the house and just went straight into his room. I'm getting kinda pissed, I didn't do anything wrong and I don't have to live my life according to his beliefs. I really hope he doesn't decide to ruin our whole visit with this crap. My mom is coming into town tomorrow so hopefully her presence will help the situation.

tl;dr - Dad acting dramatic that I have a tattoo, what can I do to move on from this situation?"

"My wife [32F] of 5 years wants to name our son after me [31M], but I hate the idea. She seems to be taking this personally even though I've told her she shouldn't.


It doesn't have anything to do with me not being happy or proud to be experiencing this with her. I'm very pleased that she soon will be the mother of my child, but no matter how I feel about her or the baby I am just not a fan of having a namesake. I think our son should have his own name, and I also think I should be entitled to keep mine. The whole thing seems hokey to me, especially when there are many great names we could pick for him, but I am flattered that she would want to honor me in this way. 

Obviously I have discussed this with my wife, and she has pushed back quite a bit, which surprised me at first. I'm not sure why this means so much to her, but for whatever the reason, this is something she seems to want badly. I'll give her credit. She has mentioned over the years that she thought it would be a cute thing to do, but I never really thought she was serious until she told me that she wanted to give our son my name. Saying something is cute is not the same thing as telling me she for sure wants to name her future son after me, but she insists that she told me in advance and I agreed, even though no such thing happened. That has become sort of a side argument and conflict here. She seems to think we already had agreed on this, but I don't think it's reasonable for her to claim we had an agreement when all I said was I thought it could be cool. That opinion has changed though.

I'm in a weird position here. I don't think my reasons for being against this are particularly persuasive, so I'm having a hard time making a good argument that this is a bad choice for our son's name. I think that (plus the hormones) is contributing to her feeling that my resistance here is somehow connected to me being ashamed of her or our baby. It seems crazy to put it into writing, but she has admitted she's struggling to understand why I'm fighting her so hard on this. 

So I think that really is the problem here. I need better reasons to try to persuade her against this, and I also need some ideas for how I convince her that this isn't anything that she should view as a negative against her. I'm not even sure how to address the fact that she thinks we previously agreed on this issue. 

Another thing I'd like feedback on is whether I should have the final say here since this is my name. I sort of am of the view that if one parent wants to name their child after the other parent then the parent who will share the name should get a full veto no questions asked. To me a name is a very personal thing and it's not right to try to force me into this situation. She also disagrees with me that my opposition immediately cancels this as a possible name choice.

"I[23M] don't want to have sex with my Girlfriend[25F] because of her insecurities during sex and nagging post sex. What should I do?


 I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year now and things for the most part have been great. However, lately things in the bedroom have become frustrating and have really been turning me off from wanting to have sex with her and I don't know what to do.


The sex is usually very good for me and I always make sure she is enjoying it as well. She never turns me down for sex and is always up for it when I initiate sex with her. The bigger problem is after we are done having sex she always complains. Sometimes its little subtle comments like ""well if we didn't have sex all the time I could have gotten this done"" or just flat out saying ""I'm tired at work all the time because we had sex"". It's extremely frustrating because she never complains and never turns me down before sex yet complains after.


**edit**: We got into an argument a few weeks back and her big thing was ""I always give you sex and I'm always tired or can't get things done when I need to because we were having sex"". When in reality we only have sex a few times a week(sometimes only one or two times). There have been a few occasions where we've had sex during the day and needed to do errands that had to be postponed because of it. She seems to stick to those few times and forget that... well it was just a few times and since she complained about it the first time I've never done it again. Now she sticks to those snide comments every chance she can get after we have sex. It's beyond frustrating to hear.

Plus my girlfriend has gained some weight over the year we have been dating and it has made her really insecure. I don't mind it and I still find her as beautiful as the day I met her. It's just that lately when we have sex she gets upset about her body and tries to hide away from me by keeping most of her clothes on to shield herself or forcing me to turn out the lights... 


This has been turning me off so much. I have sat down and tried discussing with her, but she just Stonewalls me and says snide/rude remarks about how I'm always demanding something. Then when I get fed up with dealing with her acting like that she breaks down and cries apologizing and nothing ends up getting done.


**edit2**:I've asked her to please not be so negative before, during, and after sex. She tends to berate/put herself down because of her looks and or body image. I've asked her not to feel obligated to have sex with me and to turn me down if she wasn't feeling in the mood. 

I've told her that her lack of initiation or enthusiasm when it comes to anything sexual makes me feel like she doesn't want me.  I've even told her all the things I've listed in this post.

I've asked her what's wrong if anything on my side that I can change that would make things better. 

I'm a very direct person and also I've been raised to be an open person and have never been afraid to say whats on my mind. I've told her everything I'm posting here in this thread and even some of the things people are recommending me as I've thought about this subject before.

Nothing really seems to work. She just gives me this look its a deadpan look. It's one of those looks where you know the other person really isn't paying attention. However, she is quick to pick out one or two words from everything I've said and throw them back at me like I was trying to insult her in some way.

I don't want to break up with her because other than this I think she's great but... lately I enjoy masturbating more than even bothering with sex... Is there anything I can do?

**edit3**: I'm very conflicted after reading some responses. I feel like breaking up is the easy way out. I've always been raised with the ""diamond in the rough""(is this the correct saying) type mentality. Where If do my best and try my hardest things will play out perfectly in the end. However, I can't honestly tell if it's me thinking negatively and things in this relationship are better than I think they are or they're really as bad as I think they are and I'm telling myself everything is going to be alright.  Sucks. 

  ---
**edit4**: We went to dinner earlier and had a good time. We took her car because she wanted to take me to a restaurant I've been wanting to eat at for weeks. After we are heading back and get in the car she looks very upset. I was surprised because I didn't know why she was so upset we just had a good dinner and a good time. I ask her if she is alright and she says shes fine and just doesn't feel good and that her clothes are feeling ""tight"". It was depressing because I was just having a good time and then she starts cold shouldering me and acting upset. As we are driving her phone is going off a lot and she looked at her phone and seemed even more upset. I asked her if everything was alright and who she was talking to because I was worried something came up. She ignores this for a bit and then shows me its her friends texting her. I asked her if everything was alright and whats going on to which she snaps and said that I'm being nosy and that it's none of my business what her and her friends are talking about. I told her I was honestly just worried about her because she was looking at her phone and seemed even more upset afterwards. 

She told me that she didn't like the way I was talking to her and that it's not fair that she takes me out to eat and then I get upset..(I wasn't even talking most of the way). So I sat down before she dropped me off and told her that we had some problems that we needed to talk about and they are making me feel depressed. I reiterated a lot of the things I've said in this post and some mentioned comments. I did however leave out any sex talk as I didn't feel it to be an appropriate time to talk about it as the issue here was her negativity about her body causing her to lash out at me.

She told me that she didn't want to talk about anything and wanted to leave. I told her that until she was willing to talk things out with me and have a proper discussion with me about our problems without getting upset I think we should take a break. She drives off taking my phone and wallet with her(which she just returned everything intact).  Then messages me saying that she ""can't believe I did that and that she never wants to see me again""  and she drives over to my place to drop of my phone and wallet and looked to be dressed up and had her friends in the car... figured she is going out and partying I guess(which she never does with me).

Surprisingly once I got started and the words came out of my mouth I felt a lot better. Her response and the way she is acting makes me feel better because I know that I tried everything I could and that it's out of my hands at this point. I feel quite calm and relaxed right now... I am not sure how long this feeling will last but for now I don't feel as bad as I thought.

**end edit4**

**edit5**: I in response to /u/Spektor0925 comment of ""She was cheating on you, or planning to, guaranteed.""


When we got into that first fight that I mentioned in my edit. I saw that she had unblocked her ex's number from her phone and he tried to call her while I was there. I asked her why she unblocked him and started talking to him to which she said that she was upset and angry at me and that she figured that by unblocking him it would make me upset.
I highly doubt she cheated on me thus far. Actually that is the only thing I'm confident she hasn't done. What I do agree on is that she might have been planning to cheat on me. After seeing her going out tonight I have a feeling that she wants to get back at me. Don't want to think about it much because I know it will get to me.


**edit6**: She lives down the street from my house and I know she went out with her friends so I went over to grab my stuff because she is very possessive with my stuff and I know I wont get them back If I didn't get it myself.

Her mom was home which is weird since she doesn't live there. In the over one year we have been dating I've only had two conversations with my GF's mother (she lives out of town at least 10 hours away from where we live) but I've met her quite a few times just never talked much. She asked where my GF was and I told her I wasn't sure and that she went out with her friends. Conversation continues in a friendly manner and I inform her that we were taking a break from each other at the moment.

Her mom then informs me that there are some things about my GF that I should know.

She said that my GF is very stubborn and has always throughout her life been unwilling to compromise about anything. She said that she herself has always just let my GF have her way when doing things because otherwise it makes her extremely upset. She told me that my GF has always has body issues since she was younger and that she tries to make improvements to herself but gets upset when she doesn't see the results she wants. She her own mother said that she tries to avoid her sometimes because she feels that she tends to get easily upset and lash out when things don't go her own way.


I am not sure how I feel about this. Her mom told me that the only way to deal with her is to let her have her way all the time. She told me she thinks I'm a good boyfriend to her and that she can tell I've been extremely patient with her and can tell I've been taking care of her. She asked me if I would continue to be patient with her and work things out. I didn't really respond much after that as I packed my stuff and left...

"I [27M] gave what I thought was anonymous donation to my ex's family [25F] but she apparently knew and just texted me


To make a long story short, this girl CRUSHED me. The 3.5 months we spent together felt like the start of the healthiest, most organic, and loving relationship I'd ever had. She was romantic and extremely giving and heavily invested herself in me and my family and I in hers. She wheeled me out to meet various family members and then dumped me out of a blue less than a month after I met her grandparents. And it wasn't a situation of not getting along with her family, because they all loved me and she's already expressed to me that her mom missed me.

Her grandmother was dying when we met. And then she passed. My ex left for a week when it happened and came back afterward to tell me that we were through. No conversations. No explanations. Barely any emotion. Just gone.

I've avoided contact. I've been investing in myself. I've started dating again. I've been coming to terms with her as a person and that she probably wasn't in the most mature place for a relationship. History of bailing whenever things get real. Never having been in love. Just ending a presumably good relationship out of nowhere without even trying to resolve problems. I'm still really sad about her leaving, but I've been making steps to move on and that's just how it goes.

But her family joined a charity for the illness that took her grandmother. I gave a donation to them under 'anonymous' with only my billing information tying it to me. But I guess her family could tell where it came from because she texted me this morning to thank me for it.

I haven't talked to her in weeks. I didn't want to talk to her. This wasn't supposed to be a means of communication. It was just something I did because I care about her and her family and it felt good to do. Of course I want her back, but it isn't going to happen. Talking to her isn't good for me. And now I feel like I've been thrown back into it.

Advice?

EDIT: *sigh* I gave a polite response and she asked how I was doing. I sat on answering for a while and then was curt at first, but felt bad a few hours later after getting out of the gym. So I elaborated a little bit. She responded curtly. This is pretty much what I was trying to avoid.

-----

tl;dr I gave an anonymous donation to a charity that my ex's family is sponsoring for their deceased grandmother (who I met). They apparently knew it came from me, because she texted me this morning to thank me for it. I've been avoiding talking to this girl because she crushed me and I don't need to embroil myself in the pain that comes from dealing with that. I just wanted to do something nice because I care about her and I care about her family. But her sending me that text has put my foot back into that emotional spiral I've been distancing myself from this past month. It isn't like I don't want her back, but I'm trying to not entertain that fantasy. Advice?"
"My (26f) bf (27m) broke up with a long-term girlfriend (27f) over her drinking. She's now clean and wants him back. Feeling terrified.


I met my bf about a year and a half ago through friends. He's funny, handsome smart, you know the speil. Basically we've been together since and it's been bliss.


I knew he had recently gotten out of a ltr (I think 6 years from 19 to 25 counts as long term? :s) with a girl when we met. ""Alice"" (not her real name, oc). Alice and he had been friends from a young age, eventually going out when they were nineteen. According to him it was good, but in the last year, she started drinking all the time. And not a ""nearly every night"" kind of all the time. At least two times a day everyday until she passed out before he finally left her.


He and she both come from families where alcoholism is an issue (he says this is likely why she fell into it). He says he wasn't about to live like that, or be with an alcoholic and drew the line. The break-up, according to him, was a tough one that involved completely cutting away from her.


He has said that he is totally over her and in love with me and I believed him. He never mentioned her unless prompted/neccesary. There was no contact with her. I'd never even met her. As far as I was concerned, she was his ex and that alone. He wasn't hung up on her. I wasn't a fallback option.


But recently a series of posts on facebook made the rounds amongst his friends - basically a book apologising to him, telling how she got clean, how him leaving woke her up, etc... If I'd been reading it as anything other than his gf, I'd have been cheering her on all the way. But obviously I wasn't.


This has honestly terrified me to my core. I know it's so early and it's so cringey to say but I imagine my bf in my head as ""the one"" now. The one I want to be with for the rest of my life. And this has me feeling like I'm just something in the way of his true love. I feel like the antagonist in their love story.


I told my bf this, and he says he's spoken to her and made clear that we're in a relationship and while he's very happy she's clean and he'd like to become friends again, it's me and him now. He says Alice took it hard but accepted it.


I hate this girl for making me feel this way, and I hate myself for hating her when she's done nothing wrong to me. I'm always worrying that my bf is going to leave for her, or I'm going to find something between then on his phone/social media. They knew each other so long, and they went out for so long, and went through so much together. I just can't not be paranoid about this girl.


Hating everything rn... Not even sure wether to post this here or on /r/offmychest. Is there anything I can do to get over this?


Tl;dr - Bf broke off a LTR with a girl because she was an alcoholic. She got clean largely due to him leaving and now wants him back. Worried he loves her more than me and will leave."
"My [29F] boyfriend of two years [38M] won't leave the apartment his husband died in. How do I convince him that this is no longer healthy and is stunting our relationship?


My boyfriend, Matthew, is an incredibly sweet and hardworking man. We've been together for two years and have been friends for nearly ten years. Five years ago, Matthew's husband (Hei) passed away after a brief but intense fight with cancer. Our friend group was devastated by the loss; we all loved Hei and we loved them together, and for the first few years, Matthew didn't grieve in what most of us, myself included, considered to be a healthy way. He slept with Hei's clothes, talked to him as if he were still in the room, and often times carried his ashes with him to do everything. Now, I understand that everyone mourns in their own way and none of us ever dared to say anything, but needless to say, we were relieved when Matthew finally had Hei's ashes interred and started going to therapy.

About three years after Hei died, Matthew and I began casually dating. I am a graduate student working on my doctorate in education and I don't have a lot of free time, but we know each other very well and it was easy to be together. Additionally, we both have a very intimate knowledge of the other's grief and that removed a lot of the delicacy surrounding Hei's presence in his life. Not that this should matter at all but more as a matter of propriety: the fact that Matthew is bisexual and was previously married to a man is a nonissue for me.

Fast forward two years and we've developed a very strong, incredibly healthy relationship. We spend our time very wisely, are very much in love, and are so happy together. The only sticking point, and it's becoming a bigger one as the possibility of getting engaged one day looms, is that Matthew refuses to leave the apartment that Hei died in. He's had three opportunities now to end his lease and will not do so. He's gone as far as to state that, in no uncertain terms, he will die there too because it's where Hei died. My fear is that this last holdover will never go away and I will either have to move into the apartment with him, which seems like such a mar to Hei's memory, or we'll have to break up because we can't live together. 

If what he needs and wants is for me to live there with him, I would do it in an instant. He means the world to me and he is happier than he has been in nearly five years. I am okay with not being the love of his life; I would never want to pretend like that wasn't Hei. What I am not okay with is the idea that he's so attached to the apartment because of what it represents that he'll never be able to heal that last little bit.

Reddit, I just want what's best for him. Is it indelicate for me to voice these concerns to him? Should I just accept that it's not going to change and move in there with him? To be clear, I'm not ""weirded out"" by it or anything. I just don't want to tarnish my friend's memory is all.

Many thanks if you've gotten this far.

EDIT: u/DiTrastevere suggested that I include this information and made a good point regarding its importance. Matthew used to have terrible anger problems. He was violent to a fault when the least bit inconvenienced, very quick to retaliate, and very hateful. Hei brought a calm and guidance to his life and I'm proud to say that none of us have seen the least bit of a regression since Hei's death, but I believe that Matthew associates his own goodness with Hei. It is possible that he is holding onto the apartment as a means to ensure that he has that cornerstone to his serenity and is worried about regressing to being an angry person. I had not considered that and am grateful for the insight.

tl;dr My boyfriend of two years won't leave the apartment his husband died in and I'm scared that this is going to negatively impact our relationship moving forward. How do I handle this without hurting him?"

"I (29f) visited a friend (28f) who is now requesting reimbursement for gas/beer, even though I spent a comparable amount on other things we both enjoyed.


So, this is a rather inconsequential issue, but I'm seeking the opinions of others to see if my feelings about this are reasonable.

 I spent the weekend visiting an old friend and her boyfriend, who live a couple hours away. We spent one day hanging out and making an elaborate mimosa brunch, the next day we spontaneously went snowboarding. 

 2 days after returning home I received a short text from her asking me to pay her $15 as reimbursement for gas money to the mountain and for a pitcher of beer her boyfriend bought during our lunch break up there. Now that's not a big deal and I'm generally quite generous with my money when it comes to friends. I just find it strange and a little rude that she expects me to pay her a specific amount days later when there was no in-person conversation about financial contributions to these things when they were bought. When we did the shopping for our brunch, I easily spent twice as much as she did on groceries (about $30), and I spent a chunk of change on gas money and ferry fares to come visit, not to mention that I gifted the two of them a fair amount of marijuana product when I came (it's legal in our state). I don't like counting tit for tat nor do I feel like friends need to split things perfectly evenly all of the time, as it generally evens out, but if we're playing that game, I feel like I made more than a $15 contribution to the things we all enjoyed this weekend. Also, who asks to get reimbursed for a round of drinks they bought days after the fact? I mean, I'll just get the next round, ya know?

Is it unreasonable for me to feel slightly miffed about getting that message this morning? I don't mind giving her the money, but I feel like we were already even stevens on things and that this should have been discussed in the moment, rather than requested days later, since it's such a small amount. Should I just send it to keep the peace or would I appear equally rude and stingy if I tell her I'd rather not since I spent a comparable amount on other things?

TL;DR: Visited an old friend out of town last weekend. She messaged me 2 days later asking me to send her a small amount of money for gas and beer that she bought this weekend, even though I spent a comparable amount on other things that we both enjoyed."
