"[Update] Me [30 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 1.5 years, I asked him to consider getting a job and now I feel like a demon


Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates.

[Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/)

So, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: ""How would you feel if I stopped working?"" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of ""If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?""

I wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead.

I've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day.

Wake up in the morning and he says ""...don't you have work today?"" and I'd be like ""Eh, I don't feel like it"".  The first few days he was like ""Awesome!"" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like ""So...what's up with work?"" and I tell him ""Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it"".  After the second week he says ""What's going on?!"" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to ""the machine"" either, so I'll just stay here with him.  

He FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks.

I kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah.

Anyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event.

I'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p

Anyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!


**tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again.

Edit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual ""reaction"", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a ""what's good for the goose..."" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was.

Basically...to this day he still believes he's ""right"", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really.

"(Update) I(29M) broke my wife(28F)'s heart please help me save my marriage.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46vjbn/i29m_broke_my_wife28fs_heart_how_do_i_save_my/

I had forgotten about this post and I am back to update so maybe seeing my stupidity could prevent someone else from making the same mistakes.
 I cringe when I read today what I wrote months ago and it seems ridiculous to me that I could have felt this way about another woman. I wrote that I would imagine my former coworker while lying in bed but in the end when my wife stopped acknowledging my existence waking up without seeing her face was just absolute torture. I really took all I had for granted until I almost lost it

So I took some of the advices and decided to court my wife again the hardest I could. Of course the first step was looking for another job, and it took me a month but I managed to find a similar position in another entreprise. I did what was suggested of taking over every chore and she stopped ignoring me but would simply stare at me with some kind of hostility and go on with her life. I tried flowers but she would leave them to die. My wife dominant love language is physical but I wouldn't dare try touching her so I went for telling her. I somehow realized it was really the content of what I wrote about the other woman which obviously when you are deep in a crush is amplified, that really hurt her. I tried engaging her in conversations so we could talk about what was happening to us but more importantly what I did to her but she remained closed off. And so I started writing her letters and would leave them under her pillow.

 At first I apologized for everything, for writing the post, for not putting an end to the crush faster, for making her feel like another woman could hold a higher place of importance to me and for not taking the initiative to change jobs earlier. For making her life hard by creating this situation which ended in her sleeping in the guest room of her own house, for making her cry and causing stress to her. 

Then I wrote her love letters telling her how much I loved her, how the crush couldn't compare to the deep love I have for her. I was chewed for saying I loved her because of our history in my last post but I was misunderstood. I meant that the love I have for her has gotten stronger with time. 5 years ago I loved her, but wouldn't have given her one of my organs if she needed for example while now I would without hesitation. Our history is what caused the attachement to grow stronger therefore no random crush could override that. I was awed in front of my crush and wrote sappy things about her but in the end I do not know this woman on a personal level while I have seen the worst of my wife and the love remains. 

I told her how beautiful she was and how impressed and proud I was with her development as a person since we have met, how grateful I was for her presence in my life and every single thing I was thankful for that she did and enhanced my life, how much I needed her and missed hearing her tell me how her day went, laugh at my bad jokes and basically just missed hearing the sound of her voice. This is a small sample but it must have taken a good 3 weeks of daily letters until she answered me back.

She answered with a letter of her own telling me how much I have hurt her with my crush, how I made her feel invisible next to that woman, how I never told her such loving words (until the letters) how much she hated me but also how she loved me and missed me too. Her letter allowed me to feel her vulnerability. After reading it I cried and went to see her, we locked eyes,she cried and we held each other for a long time. She started talking to me again then and softened. Honestly the possibility of the marriage ending just like that scared the both us. 

As of today we are, to my surprise, mostly back to normal and actually I feel closer to her. We continue with the letters which have helped increasing our emotional intimacy. I make an effort to tell and show her my love. I am very grateful that she has given me a second chance and even more so that she has decided to put the crush behind us. We had maybe 2  fights since but she hasn't brought it up and doesn't punish me. It really wasn't the crush on itself but how I went about it and the lack of affection from my part in comparison.
 Maybe I am being optimistic here but I truly think we are going to get through this. We will be going to couple counselling after our vacation just to make sure things are really settled between us.





   
**tl;dr**: I managed to get my wife back after working on the way I conveyed love to her and we are doing alright."
"I (29f) caught my husband (38M) reading my diary. He admitted to having done so consistently the past three years. He has a binder of some of the pages photocopied. I am unsure of how to feel in this marriage.


Posting this in personal issues because so far it feels more like a personal issue to me. 

Yesterday afternoon I came home from work early because I wasn't feeling well. I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged. 

Eventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary. 

He said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me. 

My thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this. Writing in my diary was one of the only things I had left and now it's been taken from me. I've been so sad I can't even process it. 

I don't know reddit. Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I'm overreacting and I'm sure that's what you're thinking right now. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world. I used to have so many friends and hobbies and I feel like since getting married things have changed so much. My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive. 

I can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back. 

I just needed to vent I guess. If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Would you consider this a major breech of privacy or no big deal? Do you think I'm depressed ? :(

"UPDATE: I [24F] asked a cute lady [26F] out on a date, did I make it too ambiguous?


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4q17z1/i_24f_asked_a_cute_lady_26f_out_on_a_date_did_i/)

So, I told you about ""Fiona"", the cutie pie who goes to my church who I asked out on a date.  Almost all of you reassured me it was a date, which was good advice, because it totally was.

We had brunch together and then went for a walk near the waterfront of our city. We had great chemistry, talking up a storm, but we hadn't entirely gotten ""date-y"" yet, I really wanted to hold her hand but I was too nervous. Then the fairly nice weather turned into a torrential downpour, and she invited me back to her place. We got stuck in the rain, but luckily, she didn't live too far.

When we got back to her place, we were talking and I said ""By the way...I think you're really cute."" She said ""I think you are too...I'm just kind of anxious. I'm an anxious person."" We kind of looked at each other for a second and I said, ""So...do you wanna kiss?"" (I prefer to just ask these things.) 

She said yes, and that kiss turned into a full-on makeout session which turned into some really amazing sex. At one point I said to her, before we actually started having sex, ""I really want to do this but I'm always worried that if I sleep with someone on the first date, they'll get the impression that I'm only in it for the sex, which isn't the case."" She basically told me not to worry, because she wasn't getting that impression. And then we had some seriously awesome sex.

We're hanging out again Wednesday evening. I have this terrible tendency to get ten steps ahead of myself with these things, but we seem to have really amazing chemistry and I've really got a good feeling about this.
  
**tl;dr**: It was definitely a date. A date that went really, really well."
"[Update] My [25F] boyfriend [26M] serenaded his co-worker


Hi! Thank you all for your advice. What a stressful situation. Here's a quick update. 

Link to the original-https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rihvk/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_serenaded_his_coworker/


After everything I was really pissed all of last week and was sort of planning on breaking up with him but I was taking my time making the decision because, well, break ups suck and it wasn't something I was looking forward to. I mentioned in the comments of my last post that I own a house that has been sitting vacant since I moved in with my boyfriend and it doesn't have a kitchen right now because I moved out in the middle of renovating it. I have a friend that owns a kitchen company so I asked him to come out to the house to look at it and draw up plans. He told me he would do it at cost without charging for labor and ever since I told my boyfriend that he's like ""what, are you fucking him? But how many blow jobs is it costing you?"" I work for the FD so obviously I work with a lot of (good looking) guys and he's just been so jealous lately, especially last week, trying to tell me who I can and can't talk to while at work. So, all that to say, it was definitely time for us to break up anyways. I just can't believe that he is giving me such a hard time but thinks him serenading this girl right in front of me was ok. 


I did look at a text he got that makes me think they were hooking up. I spent Thursday night out at a hotel with friends for a birthday and came home in the morning. He had a text on his phone that said something like ""omg noooo I was sleeping"" so I read through their conversation (which was conveniently deleted except for two messages) and he had texted her at 3am to see if she was awake. Maybe I'm reaching, but every time a guy has texted me that late it's been to hook up. That sealed the deal for me so I just left, it wasn't even worth fighting over because for a whole week now I've been pretty much done with him anyways. He didn't take it that well, which was surprising because it sure seemed like he wanted to break up, but whatever, it's done now.

OG Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pzlmo/our_23f22f_brother_26m_has_publicly_humiliated/

Hi everyone, so this more of a thank you more than anything. This is a really happy update. 

Our mother returned to Michigan yesterday and we informed her of the whole situation. We told her that Micheal (older/Vegas brother) had embarrassed Nick (little brother) on Facebook. We told her what was said and all about the situation. She gave Mike the biggest lecture of all time. She basically told him he can run around and get STI until he has them all, she can't control him. But he will not influence Nick to follow his poor example and endanger himself. She told him they teach safe sex for a reason and don't make condoms for shits and giggles. 

My sister and I went out and bought our brother some condoms. It was not as awkward as we thought it was going to be, but we had a conversation with us about them. We told him that we are proud of him and we told him girls would like him alot more for his actions. 

Super happy about this Dayna, the girl who he almost had sex with/his crush. Dayna asked him out on a date and they are going on a date tonight. So he is super happy about that and he is feeling good about his decision to stop. Nick is taking Dayna out on  date to the movies tonight so that's good. 

tl;dr: Mom gave older brother a lecture of a lifetime, got the younger bro some condoms. Brother is taking out the girl he almost had sex/ his crush on a date to the movies

"I [32M] asked my girlfriend [33F] of 12 years to marry me, and she said no, now she is being extremely distant and i am really confused


Me and my girlfriend have never fought, we get along fine. We have been living together for 9 years now, and have been dating for 12 years. We have a healthy sex life, we both have decent jobs that bring in decent money. In the past we talked about marriage a lot and would often joke about what our wedding would be like (yes i know how stupidly lame this sounds), however we always agreed we needed to settle down first. 

We bought a house about a year and a half ago, and were finally able to settle down. Our work schedules normalized, we were able to remove a huge waste of time from commuting, and we were finally able to take various activities after work (e.g. Dancing classes, cooking classes, etc). We were able to finally settle down. 

Finally we decided to take a week off and unplug on the week of 12 year anniversary. She wanted to go camping and hiking, and do the things we used to do when we were first dating. Unbeknownst to her i secretly decided to pick the exact same area where we met to do our hiking/camping trip. 

Two weeks ago as we are leaving she realizes where we are going and becomes ecstatic, and gushes about how romantic i am. More or less everything seems perfect. We do our hike, and we unpack, setup and by sundown everything feels perfect. So i decided to pop the question. 

This is where everything kind of falls apart, i ask her, and she just says ""no"". We literally went from ""i love you's"" to the single most akward silence i have ever had in my life in the time span of about a minute. We sat there kind of not saying anything before she says she is tired and goes to bed. She basically proceeds to cry her self to sleep while i sat there doing nothing. I basically didn't sleep and the next morning, she says she wants to go home. So we pack up and have a really awkward 3 hour hike back to our car. There were a few times where things kind of felt normal and we were joking around like we used to be for a bit. 

On the way back home, we are talking and chatting normally, but it just feels akward. At one point we stopped for coffee, and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened and all i got was a curt ""no"". This is followed by another extremely long silence for the rest of the drive home. We finally get home and i unpack everything while she goes off to bed she is going to bed.

Cue more crying, i tried really hard to talk to her but she pretty much told me that she just needs time to be alone and think. The next day she tells me she is going to take some time and see her family (which is literally on the other side of the country). 

It has been about two weeks since i dropped her off at the airport, she sent me a few messages to tell me she is fine, and that she needs some more time to think. Her best friend has been asking me every other day about what is going on with her, since she hasn't really been responding at all. I know she is okay though due to her posting some pictures of her and her family on Instagram. But it just feels really weird.

I am an absolute giant mess, i just don't quite understand what is going on. None of my friends have really offered me anything of value. I just feel if i didn't ask the question everything would be absolutely fine, and i don't really understand what is going on. 

I keep wanting to grab her laptop to try and figure out anything. I am not close to her parents at all, but i trust her and want to respect her space, but I don't know when she is coming back. I even sent her a message this morning and i know she saw the message and received it. But hasn't replied. 

Also her work has called me this morning asking about where she is. Apparently she had taken an extra week off last week, but she was supposed to be in yesterday.
   
**tl;dr**: Asked my girlfriend of 12 years to marry me, and she said no. Now everything feels like it is falling apart and i have no idea what to do. What should i do?

P.S. I am sorry if this comes off really rambly, i am just trash at writing, and have rewritten this half a dozen or so times. 

*EDIT* To clarify a few things.

The reason why it took so ong for us to get married, is we both agreeded we wouldn't move to the next step until we finished the following:

* We both finished school, for her that wasn't until 2 years ago
* We both had stable jobs
* We had a place where we could agree would be good enough to take stuff to the next step
* We both had decent working hours, for a long time she was doing her residency and we more or less worked opposite shifts.

We did talk about marriage, and kids and both agreeded it would be part of the next step after we got settled.

My son was diagnosed with a brain tumour about 3 months ago and since then doctors have tried everything to remove it. About three surgeries later, they tell me to take him home to make him more comfortable for the worse. He's been in and out of hospital about several times (throwing up bile,  dehydration and not being able to past stools properly.) Its emotional as it is. I haven't slept in what feels like years. 

He's dying. My son wakes up for about a few hours a day to drink and then falls back asleep. I have a new issue that's arrived. My own damn mother. My own mother who never wanted to see my son because she was too busy drinking and partying. She found out about his cancer and made it all about her. I've seen her Facebook posts. She writes that I'm trying to keep her away and that she loves her grandson dearly. She's tried calling CPS on me, tries to assault me when I get in my car to go home to shower and is always drunk. The nurses have been an amazing help but it's been emotionally draining. I literally have to sit down and watch my son die over the next few days and my own mother who has never asked how I'm doing keeps trying to pry back into our lives and make mine especially hard. Could I please have some insight from other stories and what I could do? I don't have many people.
I only have a boyfriend who's helped tremendously but even then, I don't like to ask him to do much. 

Also, his  dad is out of the story. He knows about everything but he said he wanted nothing to do with this. His mother said the same.

"[Update] Russian guy (33/M) who slept with ""mentally challenged"" American girl [31/f]


Hello All,

So, I posted here last week about a girl I met and had a one night stand with.  Shortly after this happened I started thinking about her a lot and wanting to see her again.  I didn't have any of her contact info.  I didn't even know her last name.  All I knew was where she lived.  So I went to the bar where I met her and asked the people who work there if they know her and if she comes in there a lot.  

They knew her.  She does go in there a lot according to them.  But they also both told me she's ""the R word.""  And this wasn't just them joking around.  I mean, they meant it.  The guy who served us that night even questioned why I couldn't tell, and told me if he would have known I was going home with her he would have stopped me.  Afterwords I felt really disgusted with myself and was even worried about getting in trouble with the law.  Because a mentally challenged person can't consent.  

Here is the original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbrem/me_33_m_had_a_one_night_stand_with_a_girl_people/

So, I decided to hell with them.  I followed the advice I got on this sub and another forum I posted on.  (And I just want to say, people on this sub were amazing.  You guys really helped me see the situation for what it was.)  

So anyway...  to the actual update.  I went to her house and left a note with my number and told her I want to see her again and to call if she is interested.  And if not, no hard feelings.  

Well, she didn't call, but she did text me on Thursday afternoon.  She told me she hopes it's ok that she texted instead of calling, and that she hates talking on the phone.  (I am mentioning this because someone told me it might be an indicator of Autism.)  And sorry to trail off a little here... but the night we met and had a one nighter she wouldn't let me kiss her on the mouth.  And from what I read some people with Autism are standoffish like that when it comes to physical affection and stuff.  

So, I will stop going off on tangents.  We decided to go out on a date Saturday night.  We met at the same bar where they told me she was ""the R word"".  Meeting there was her suggestion.  But I ended up taking her to this Japanese place here in town, because she loves Sushi.  We went back to her place and I stayed there with her until about an hour ago.  

I am not sure how many details to give... but we had a good weekend together.  On Saturday night when we got back to her place we watched a few movies and had a few drinks.  And yes, if anyone wonders, there was carnal knowledge. (Quite a few times over the weekend, lol.) 

And then yesterday a few of her friends dropped by.  Nobody had to work today because it's the 4th of July, so there was pretty much an impromptu party at her place last night.  They didn't know she had company but it was fine.  I got to meet a lot of her friends.  They seem like good people.  Apparently her house is the hangout house in her circle of friends.  

Today we went out and did a few things.  I would have stayed with her longer, but I have to be at work really early tomorrow and have to get to bed early tonight.  We are already talking about going out again this weekend.  I can't really see her during the week because of conflicting work schedules.  (She works at night, I work during the day.)  But we both have weekends off.)

As far as her mental condition... screw it.  I don't see anything wrong with her.  She may be Autistic, but obviously it doesn't affect her life all that much.  

So, to everyone who wanted an update, there it is.  I want to thank everyone again fro all the encouragement and for all the positivity.  It's been a long time since I've felt like this.

"My [38F] son [7M] has various food allergies and his friends mom [40sF] doesn't take them seriously.


My son Simon has a lot of food allergies that we discovered when he was very young. The main ones are gluten, eggs, cocoa or chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. None of the allergies are deadly, but eating these foods makes him very sick. For example, gluten makes him dizzy, he vomits, and he gets headaches, and touching an orange with his bare hands makes his skin itch and swell. Despite these allergies, my son is very friendly, outgoing, and happy, and he is not a picky eater, he will eat pretty much anything he isn't allergic to.

I know not everybody is used to dealing with these types of allergies, so I try to be very accommodating. I pack his school lunches and send a box of gluten free brownies to the school every month or so in case a kid has a birthday and brings in a treat my son can't eat. I usually ask his friends' parents if they can sleep over at our house so they don't have to deal with his allergies, but if he does stay over another house I pack him his own food and give the parents a list of things he can't have. I offer to give the parents of his friends bunches of bananas and bags of cut carrots for when he comes over, but most of them say it is no problem and they just keep a few in the house in case he comes over. My son is very good at spotting whole foods he can and can't eat (like he knows he can have blueberries, but he can't eat lemonaid), but I still like to give a list in case the family bakes or cooks something with one of his off limits foods in it. Every family so far has been really kind and accomodating.

My son makes new friends all the time and he recently became friends with a new boy at his school. They have become very close very quickly. They wanted to have a sleep over a few weeks ago and I contacted the other mother and asked if Simon and his friend could stay at our house. I explained that it makes things easier because of the food allergies. The other mother said she would not be okay with that because there is no man in my house (I'm divorced) and she wants her son safe. I live in a very safe gated community, but I know some people are very protective of their kids. So I sent Simon over with a safe cookie for a snack and some cereal and almond milk for the morning. The next morning, the mother dropped them off and told me that she was unhappy about Simon eating his own food. She said she thought he should bring enough for everyone. I told her out right that most kids who are used to eating regular cookies don't like gluten free cookies because they taste different, and they're also very expensive so I couldn't buy a whole box every weekend. But I said okay.

The next weekend, Simon stayed over there again with a few other boys for a little Fourth of July party. I sent a whole box of cookies, more cereal with almond milk, and a big bag of safe oatmeal with instructions. The oatmeal is just certified gluten free oats with some brown sugar and nutritional powder, and you add the almond milk and stir slowly for maybe 5 minutes until it gets soft. I figured this way the mom could make them the same oatmeal if she wanted to be fair or she could use the cereal if she didn't want to cook. I picked Simon up the next day and he looked kind of sad. The mother kind of snidely told me she didn't appreciate having to cook for my son, I asked her what she meant, she talked about the oatmeal. Then her son came up and told me that he didn't like the cookies much, but he really loved the oatmeal, and he said thank you. (I don't know where this good is learning his good manners because it isn't his mother.)

In the car, Simon told me he was sad because the night before, the other mother had taken all of the boys on a surprise trip to McDonalds. He politely asked if he could stop at my house to get a sandwich that was safe for him to eat because we only live five minutes away. I guess his friend's mom snapped at him and said he needed to ""man up"" and find something on the menu he could eat. Simon was so embarassed that he sat there and ate nothing while his friends ate burgers and fries. I am not okay with shaming my son or with language like ""man up,"" so I called the other mother and asked her about the situation. She basically told me that she thought I was making up Simon's allergies to make him seem ""special,"" and anyway, ""It's not like he'll die from them."" I was kind of shocked, so I said that I think Simon needs to stay home this weekend. Now I'm not sure what to do.

As a background note, my husband and I divorced on good terms a few years back because we realized we wanted different things from life. My husband remarried and moved to a big city on the other side of the United States that is very diverse and has lots of restaurants and stores that cater to all kinds of people. My son visits his dad in the summer and never has a problem getting food there, also, he mostly plays with his stepsister when he's there, so he doesn't worry about going to other people's houses.

How do I stand my ground with this mother without pushing too far? Am I expecting too much? Can my son still be friends with this boy?

   
**tl;dr**: My son Simon has a lot of food allergies. I normally send him to sleepovers and school with safe food but his new friend's mother doesn't seem to think that's enough and is making it difficult for him when he stays over. How do I make sure Simon can have his new friend and be safe?

"UPDATE: I [15M] have to leave my home and be alone of the 4th of July because my bio mom [40's] does not want me around


og post:https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r9gx7/i_15m_have_to_leave_my_home_and_be_alone_of_the/

Hi Reddit, so this is not a happy update at all. It would seem talking to Chloe (mom) about it was the worst thing I could do. 

When my mom took me out several nights ago, I told her I was sick of being left out of family events. I told her I was sick on the nick name "" pretty bastard"" that my cousins gave me. Yes because I am better looking then my male cousins they called me pretty bastard. Chloe never knew about this nick name, I thought Ally (other mom told her about it)

When Chloe got home, her and Ally (other mom, lesbian moms) got into a argument over me and the whole situation. Details I don't really want to go into because they are a bit personal were brought up. Well Chloe decided it's best they separate and takes me with her if she could not stand up with her to the family. 

My other mother Ally, well turns out she was cheating on Chloe so she had no problem with leaving the house. Ally said she needs to put her family that did so much for her first. Ally still wants to see me when everything calms down. 

As expected the extended family has cut all contact with us, blocked us on Facebook and everything. Ally has gone to go live with her new partner so it is just me and Chloe (mom) in the house now. 

So yeah, everything fell to shit pretty much. Me and Chloe will be fine financially she has a really good job  

tl;dr: My moms got into a argument over me, turns out Ally was cheating on Chloe. Ally has gone to live with her new partner and extended family has cut all contact with us"
"My [35 F] husband [35 M] of 11 years cheated in our home, while I was asleep; then it got worse.


I (35 F) have been married 11 years but we've been together 16. My husband has some health issues so he doesn't work or drive any more. His judgement is impaired and before all that, he was mentally ill. But he was faithful and loving. Things have been strained the last two years.



We're moving out of state. He tells me a high school friend on Facebook is terminally ill. A few days later, he asks to visit her with another friend I like. It is bad timing, Sunday night, as our child has school Monday morning and he walks him to school, but he swears he'll be able to do so.


Finally, I agree. I lost my best friend to cancer...I'm soft for it. He goes. Returns at 4am via uber with a story about the party devolving due to bad elements showing up. (It was an hour away)


I take my son to the Dr cause he's too tired. I notice a funny charge on my card. An uber ride for $36 or so after the one he took. The records show it was from near our house to an hour away. He swears he had no idea what happened. 


He's spending a lot of time on the phone, texting, Facebook. He's become his friends with this terminally ill girl. I'm worried what that well do to him when we move, if she gets worse. She's always getting herself into trouble. Stories of not eating, needing to be saved. I keep refusing. 


She needs a place to stay. I cave in, though I refuse to let her two friends stay. I tell my husband she has to come after my son's therapy session.  She comes hours beforehand. Thus begins two days of things I want to forget.


I was nice to her. I didn't know. But when I woke up after the second night and there was a bed laid out on the living room floor and my husband was in my son's bed with her? I woke him up. He claims she wanted comfort after a scary movie. I didn't believe him. I told him she needed to leave. 


He finally got her an expensive uber ride. She was supposed to go see her dr, but skipped out to a friend's house. 


Mind you, during the time she was here I was working and took my son to an important doctor appointment that my husband swore he would go to. I repeatedly told my husband I was uncomfortable and asked if they had an inappropriate relationship. 


That night I got him to admit they kissed. Ok...sure. He admitted she did something to him. Finally, I asked to see his phone if there was nothing to worry about. Well, text messages were relatively clean. Not so with Facebook. That's how I found out he didn't know her before their first meeting when he brought her back to our apartment while I was asleep with my son &amp; brought her back in after he went to school.  The things they said are burned in my brain. 


They were doing things in my apartment while my son watched cartoons and I was at work; or while we slept. I can't believe the nerve, the betrayal. He thought he could get away with it. He told her he loved her - after a few short weeks (which tells me something wrong there). 


I trashed everything I associate with her or them...blankets, his clothes, stuff she left... I have to live here. At least til the end if the month. When I think about it, I want to throw up and my chest hurts. I can't tell anyone. He took advantage of my son's disabilities and my blind spots.  (And he knew it based on reading the messages)


He is very insistent that the reason he did this is because he was seeking affection. First night it was revealed he was yelling right back at me over it. But I refuse to let him use that against me. Our issues before didn't warrant this treatment.


My instincts all told me, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying the price. We move out of state in a couple weeks. Lease is signed. I can't afford it without him. I don't know what would happen with my son without him.


So my question is: can I move forward with him? Should I? I am his caretaker, though that may have led to some of our issues in the first place. 


How do you protect yourself after such a violation? How can I tell he's sorry for what he did, not sorry he got caught? 

   
**tl;dr**: Husband slept with other woman in our home while I was sleeping, at work and while son was there - as secret &amp; as house guest. How do I move forward? How can I tell if he's remorseful? "
"My sister [26F]'s som has same birthday as our sister [19F] and she's mad that me [23M] and others didn't go to her son's birthday party.


Jenny [26F], Ada [19F].

So last year Jenny had son on Ada's 18th birthday and they share the same birthday. It wasn't urgent or anything, it was a scheduled birth. I didn't like this. I told Jenny that she shouldn't have done this and she got upset and told me that I have no right to tell her when she should deliver her son. Fair enough. 

So Jenny had her son on exactly Ada's 18th birthday. Ada was understandably upset about the whole thing. Jenny at one point told Ada that ""I hope you're not upset that we won't be celebrating your birthdays anymore"". She didn't have a birthday party although me and cousins took her out the night before her birthday. It was the least we could do for her given the situation. 

So we thought that we throw the party for Ada this year. We've been arranging it for quite a while now. However just a few days before the birthday, Jenny said that she's going to have a birthday for her son as well, on the same night. Again I suggested that she can have one one night before or after, but she insisted that the party will be on the actual birthday. She told us to reschedule or accept that people won't come to Ada's party.

Ada was again upset but there was no need for her to concede this time. So we kept the plans as they were. The birthdays were last week so two parties on the same night. Almost everyone from our family and friends came to Ada's birthday. So at Jenny's party they had only people from her boyfriend's family.

So Jenny is now extremely upset at me, Ada, others, parents, everyone because she thinks it was embarrassing for her that she didn't have anyone from her side at the party and it looked like she doesn't have anyone and people don't care about her. I think it was her own fault. We already didn't have a party for Ada last year and this year we planned/announced it weeks before she did. If she had moved the party a few days around I'm sure most people would have attended it.

Now Jenny expects us all to apologize to her and promise that from now on we won't let her down like that. I don't think anyone has anything to apologize for and I don't think that anyone has let her down. By doing things like that she's setting herself up to be let down.

So what should we do? End the terror and give her what she wants or stand firm? She's usually used to getting her way but I think this time she's going too far. 
   
**tl;dr**: Sister arranged her son to be born on our little sister's birthday and now demands that we treat her son's birthday as higher priority and is upset that we didn't. She wants us to apologize. "
"I [37M] have a disrespectful, mean stepdaughter [18F], and my wife [43F] expects me to pay for her college education


[removed]"
"Birth mother paid off my college education, died, and now everyone feels I owe them money.


My birth mother Linda [50sF] paid all my college debt off a few years ago. My adopted mom passed away when I was 12 and my Dad [62M] works a lot and lives in another state. I am not close with him, he is not someone who really likes to keep in touch much. 

I [27F] was contacted by Linda when she got sick. She said she wanted to tie up loose ends. I had a great relationship with her for two years before she passed. During this time, she told me she had two other kids. They were both older than me. Linda had me during a time when she was divorced from her husband, slept with another man, and couldn't care for me. 

I don't blame Linda for my life, I had a good one, I get it. So we were able to have a sort of... aunt/niece relationship. 

She paid off my student loans for me, saying she did it for all her kids. Long story short, Linda passed away six months after paying for my loans. I got a check in the mail and did not attend her funeral [as it was in another country from where I am now living.] I did, however, send her husband flowers for her grave and plan to visit when I have time off from work. 

I got a box of keepsakes from her [pictures of when she was pregnant, a baby book she made for me, letters] and a check for a small amount [less than $2000]. There was a note with the check saying I should spend the holidays with my father. I don't make enough money to come home and Dad cannot pay the $2000 for a ticket.

Linda is one of the nicest people I have ever had in my life and I felt guilty that she gave me money. But she changed my life when she did. I wouldn't be able to teach in Korea if not for her, which was a dream of mine. 

Recently I have gotten a message from my [half] brother Jason [39M]. He said that he had read the will and saw I was listed on there. He looked me up on FB and found some pictures of Linda and me together. So he knew it was me. 

He told me that he had two kids, one was 12, the other 16. He told me that he had gone over his mother's bank statements and found she gave me a large sum of money. 

I explained she paid off my student loans. 

He then accused me of using ""HIS"" mother for cash, that I was not entitled to the cash, and the money came from a college fund ""Mom had set up for her grandkids."" 

&gt; You are not her daughter or my sister. I am furious that you would come into her life and demand money from her. You had parents. 

I have had other people write me on Facebook that I don't know but figure are related to Linda. One is the daughter [16] the other is an aunt [50s]. They have all said the same thing: I took advantage of a dying woman, promised things I shouldn't have, and took what belonged to the daughter.

They want me to pay for daughter's education. I told them no, I was not going to do that. I don't know this girl, I don't know them. All I knew was Linda. I blocked them all and locked down my profile. 

I am just at a loss what to do. I didn't ask Linda to pay for my college and I certainly didn't ask her to deny some girl her education. I am debt free, living a good life, and now I feel like some girl got shit on because of me. My birth family now thinks I am a manipulative brat. That I swooped in to take some poor sick lady's money. 

I don't know what to do? 

**TL;DR** Birth mother paid off my college education, died, and now everyone feels I owe them money.

"UPDATE: Me [30F] with my friend [34 M] of 2 years, will NOT accept that I don't want to date his friend.


Alright, here we go. Original post below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4od4w5/me_30_f_with_my_friend_34_m_of_2_years_will_not/

So after I made my original post things seemed to be fine. Then I learned over the course of a few more instances who this guy really is. 

First I should mention that while I met Eric 2 years ago in this new city, he is not a model but works in the industry. I'm trying really hard to not be obvious because everyone involved uses reddit. 

We worked on one of my shoots together and the owner of the video production company later randomly called me and asked me if he could take nude photos of me. Naturally I wouldn't be able to tell a soul including his *wife* because this was a *secret* hobby of his. I told that guy my answer was a **hard no** and never heard from him again. I sat on that disturbing situation for a while then one day told Eric. His response was an underwhelming ""everyone has their issues."" So I followed up with "" I just think you should know, in case you're introducing models to him for networking purposes; you know what he's capable of."" Eric responded with a flat ""thanks."" Eric didn't know the production company owner, they met on the set of my shoot. So I don't know, we aren't friends from way back but I expected some sort of loyalty at least in his response? I wasn't expecting him to say ""I'll never work with the guy,"" but he couldn't have cared less.

Eric continued to make comments about setting me up with his friend, to which I continued to make clear I was uninterested. Then finally we all got together for brunch. At one point Eric and I were left at the table alone and I said ""alright let's talk"". I wanted to schedule a shoot a couple months out that he would be involved in. He immediately assumed I wanted to chastise him about continually suggesting that I date his friend. I said ""no, that's not what I was intending to discuss, but to reiterate your friend is a great person, but I am in no way interested."" That was the last time he brought it up. So I felt he had the ability to be reasonable if pressed, but certainly pushed boundaries.

One night we were playing card games and I started to notice that he seemed annoyed with everyone all the time. He seemed incapable of being challenged even in the slightest ways, often pouting. He'd get up, throw his head back and leave the table etc. His wife was CONSTANTLY apologizing to him for things that didn't seem like offenses. At one point he got up and left the table and she said sorry to him, no kidding, 5 times in rapid succession.  As she was apologizing to him for one of his imagined slights, her friend piped up and said **you don't need to apologize**. She'd been friends with this guy for longer than she knew her husband, so that was my signal something was up. I didn't know them to comment on their relationship. They just got married, so they could literally be driving each other up a wall. However, the friend's response let me know that perhaps this wasn't first year marriage problems. This was after another outing where he was flat out being mean to her. When she walked away he said she was having an anxiety fit. Didn't seem that way to me. Anyone would be frazzled by their significant other being a jerk to them in public. I noticed that aside from the one friend of hers piping up for her, his other friends just sort of sat quietly. 


If you haven't noticed I don't easily develop opinions about things. Being a model means that people perceive you as and treat you as an idiot constantly. I've endured my fair share of false perceptions so I try to feel people out until they ""hang themselves.""


Fast forward to the 4th of July, we're up on their rooftop and the sun was BEAMING. I was wearing a shirt dress with a sports bra and running shorts underneath. I pulled down the top of my dress and tied it around my waist. So imagine I'm sitting in a sports bra, with a bunch of clothes tied around my waist. At some point we started discussing Marvel Comics ( a mutual interest of ours). I commented how I was tired of the franchise not developing Storm and Rogue's story lines. He then awkwardly chimed in that if women wanted to be perceived differently they needed to change the way people saw them, ""manage the T&amp;A"" (Tits and Ass). It was the most random, irrelevant, and ridiculous thing I'd ever heard. Everyone else just got quiet and looked at him. I challenged him. I told him that Wolverine runs around entire movies with no shirt on at all, so what was his point? He then made another bizarre comment of ""everyone has to do their part, if I know a friend is an alcoholic I'm not going to put alcohol in front of him."" I asked ""so you're saying that men are addicted to women's bodies and as a result are helplessly incapable of controlling themselves and their own actions. So instead, the woman is responsible for managing the oppression?"" He repeated ""everyone has to do their part, it's not fair..but it's how it is."" This went on, before I realized it was idiotic and I was done with the conversation. His wife sat quietly, everyone did.  At that moment I knew I would never be close ""friends"" with him. In my opinion I felt he revealed himself as a misogynist and it made perfect sense that he felt he could set me up with his best friend, where I would be bringing majority of the benefits to the table.

Sidenote: He is obsessed with being right and sounding intellectual. If you make a counter argument he will smirk, look down and to the left as if you're the biggest idiot.

I recently got into gaming as a way to manage the mental stress of growing my business. They all game as well. Recently we were playing online and Eric threw a fit while we were losing a game. I told him all the things he said we were doing wrong, he was doing himself as well. He got louder, and I got louder. I will not be spoken over by some guy who I feel is loud and wrong **all the time**. Then he said ""you're new to the group so you don't know this, but I don't like be talked to that way."" 

Oh dear, I've definitely noticed ;-).  


AGAIN, everyone got quiet. His best friend was also playing with us and said to him regarding the game ""Eric you seem to be the only one who feels this way."" To which Eric responded ""well make me not feel this way."" His best friend said ""I don't know how to not make you not feel this way."" Eric went into full pout mode and would not speak. Anyone familiar with gaming knows that if you get into a game against other people, you have to commit, lest get a deserter penalty. Well Eric didn't commit on his end and we all got a deserter penalty, because he had to go use the restroom. He didn't bother saying a word in advance, he just left. When he came back someone asked why we got a deserter penalty, and his best friend STRUGGLED to explain why, because he was trying to avoid just saying what Eric did. My final realization was that this guy over time has conditioned his friends and family to walk on eggshells for him. I'd had enough. We all ignored his pouting and kept playing.

So I'm back on the friendship market. I won't be proactively trying to hang out with them. Although I do find everyone around him wonderful, I suspect none of them would be friends with me 
anyways if he caused enough of a stir about it.

Sorry I'm exhausted while typing this, so please forgive me for not including each redditor's names:
 
Regarding meeting friends, r/relationship suggested Meetup groups which I've tried but will give it another go.

I had another person comment that they were surprised I was having trouble dating in tech. I can't explain it more beyond most of the men in this exact niche of the tech industry are much much older and married. So this particular part of the industry isn't bustling with dating options for me.

I had a redditor comment that she too encountered many bad apples because of her looks as well. She had to learn that many ways these men were asking her out seemed harmless or even romantic, but were quite the opposite. Her comment was so dead on for me  that I copied it to my computer to look at every now and then as a reminder.

I also want to reiterate that dating is **not** a priority for me right now. I truly am focused on building a platonic friendship base here, so that I can find some balance.

EDIT: To clarify I work with Eric in the modeling industry, my soon to be full time business is in tech and completely separate. It's just that someone asked why I couldn't find a date in that field so I mentioned it. Sorry for the confusion!

EDIT 2: The gaming community has been incredibly welcoming and it's much appreciated. Although, I'm shocked only one person guessed the game I was referring to. SMITE baby!!! :-P

"Me [21 F] with this guy I've known for a while[21 M], rejected him because he's religious, now I'm the bitch.


So, this guy and I have been friends for a while, and recently he told me he liked me and asked me out on a date. I rejected him politely, and he started pestering me about why. After a few such messages with me repeating ''It's really not you, it's me'' (which sounds cliché, but you know... It is /me/) he asked whether it was because he was religious and I said in part, yes, it is because of that. 

Here's the thing- I live in a very catholic country and I've had nothing but bad experiences with religion. Being religious is a deal breaker for me. Is it wrong of me to feel like that? On some level, probably, as I do understand being religious does not automatically make someone an extremist but I don't want those kinds of people as life partners- it brings about a million of huge, important life questions, some of which I cannot compromise on, and I wouldn't ask someone to compromise their beliefs on my account either. He knows this is my view, as we've discussed it a few times, peacefully and rationally.

He went off, calling me shallow and what not and like... Ok, I can handle that. I can recognize that I'm known to be shallow at times, I can live with that. But he talked to our friends and even put a status update on facebook along the lines of ''LosingMyReligionLOL wants me to reject God, but I'd rather be rejected by her than do that'' which was... A bit over the top, and unnecessarily dramatic if you ask me, but fine. People are sometimes emotional in these situations. I get it. 

But here's the thing- I'm being bombarded with messages and e-mails from what I'm sure are well-meaning friends asking me to reconsider my stance- why don't I give him a chance? He's SUCH a nice guy, though, and the fact that he's religious is really such a small thing about him! You'd hate it if someone rejected you just because you're not religious, that would be unfair! You're so intolerant- maybe you should consider attending a mass or two and broaden your horizons? Friends have also cancelled our dates and I've been uninvited from a wedding, due to the fact that 'I won't share the true joy of the sacrament because of my narrow views'. I don't really care about the sacrament, I'm there to celebrate what's supposed to be the happiest day of your life so far, and it hurts me that that's not an option anymore. 

What I'm asking here is not if I was right or if he was wrong. As far as I'm concerned, and from what I've been seeing, I've made the best possible choice. I need to know the best way to deal with this onslaught of attention and slander (admittedly, this is a dramatic way to put it) from my friends because I'm tired of explaining to everyone that yes, his religion is a part of the reason I rejected him, and while it is the thing that cemented my decision, it is not the only thing. I need to know how to actually come to terms with the fact that my friend of seven years would have me over for coffee but not for her wedding. How do I deal with this? Do I just cut out everyone who continues to badger me about this? Give me some tips, reddit, I'm begging you. 



   
**tl;dr**: Rejected a guy mainly because religion is a dealbreaker for me and now there's a campaign that's both against me, because I'm so ''narrow-minded'' and a campaign for me to change my mind and date him. How do I deal with this?"

Earlier this week a woman contacted me, I know of her (I didn't know her). She is ex girlfriend of my husband. They were together for a very short time. She asked to meet to talk about something really important. So we met yesterday. She told me that after she had broken up with my husband she realized that she was pregnant and she told him that she got an abortion. My husband told me about this.

In reality, she never had that abortion. She had the baby and never told my husband. Since they didn't remain in contact my husband never knew of the child's existence. And the child has now passed away because of Neuroblastoma. She said that she couldn't live with herself if she didn't reach out to us and leaves it in my hands whether to tell my husband or not.

So now I'm left with this devastating news which I don't know whether to tell my husband or not. He'll be devastated to hear that not only he had a child that he wasn't in there for him but the child spent a long time being ill and my he didn't do anything to help, and the child is now gone. If he knew the child he would have wanted to be in his life and be there for him in his time of need. This news will destroy him. On the other hand it's the truth, and I don't know how hiding this might affect him in the long term if he ever learns.

The child's mother told me that nobody else knows my husband is the father and she herself won't ever contact us again. 

I don't know what I should do. It's such a huge thing and I don't know if I should keep it from my husband for the sake of sparing him the pain.
   
**tl;dr**: Husband had a son that he didn't know about who died recently. I don't know if I should tell him or keep this secret forever."
"My [15F] aunt [33F] didn't invite me to her wedding while inviting my brothers [18/13M] and other cousins.


I'm just very upset now because my aunt's wedding is soon and I learned that I can't go to the wedding because she didn't invite me. I have a physical disability and I need crutches but I can handle myself. The invitation to our family says my parents and my brothers.

My dad talked to my aunt and she thought that the venue isn't friendly and comfortable for me and that's why she didn't invite me. If that's the only reason, isn't that something I should decide? Maybe I can handle myself in that venue. Maybe my brother and dad will help me if I needed help. She excluded me because I have a disability. My parents told me that I need to understand that it's her wedding and she gets to decide who comes and I can't be upset and I should respect her decision. I told them that if she thinks I'm not good enough to be at her wedding then I don't want to see her or talk to her again but they tell me that I should continue to be a good niece and respect her and be friendly with her. I don't understand why?

Do I have a right to be upset and not wanting to talk to her again?
   
**tl;dr**: Aunt didn't invite me to her wedding because I'm disabled and she thinks I can't handle the venue. I'm very upset and don't want to talk to her again but parents tell me it's not a big deal and expect me to forget about it and act as it never happened."

"My [28f] boyfriend [35m] was arrested


Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r7yu3/my_28f_boyfriend_35m_is_going_to_prison_im/

After consulting people in my life - friends, family and then after reading the reddit thread I decided to do what most people were telling me to do - I broke it off with my boyfriend. The day after the reddit thread I got a meeting with him in the evening. I told him that I can't live my life like this, I can't be with someone who would jeopardize his entire life like this, his future etc. His employer had already told him not to return and he seemed really bummed out about the whole thing, when I told him that I can't do this he seemed hurt and I just started crying. He didn't get upset, he was a bit irritated it seemed, but then he just said ""Well, I guess this is it then, I'll tell someone to go pick my stuff up from our place, bye."" and left the meeting. I got some support from one of the wives of his friends (she's my friend/acquaintance I guess you could say) she told me that she was 100% divorcing her husband after this as well, that she's already filing papers - she told me not to listen to anybody saying I'm doing the wrong thing because both of them are just ""pieces of shit"". She told me her husband had promised her that he was done with all of the criminal bullshit and that she couldn't do this anymore, so she doesn't even blame me for leaving him at all.

I've been crying for the last couple of days. His mom called me the very next morning and called me a piece of trash, a horrible person, said that I'm a snake who used his son and abandoned him the second something bad happened to him, that I'm a snake because I can't even trust someone who I ""supposedly"" loved. I tried explaining her my side of things, she just kept screaming that if I loved him I would have supported him no matter what. She ended our conversation by saying that she's happy this happened because at least her son managed to see who actually cared about him and who didn't.

That evening, he got bailed out of jail. I was coming home from the store when I saw a van parked in front of my house and I saw him carrying his stuff into it, I pulled into our parking lot and went into our apartment - his friend was there with his girlfriend moving his stuff with him. They said hi to me, we chatted for a bit. Then a few minutes later he came back to get some more boxes, all he said to me was ""I talked to our landlord, I sorted myself out of the lease."" and then just got his stuff and left, he didn't even really seem to care about me at all. I pretended I didn't care, but I had locked myself in another room and I quietly weeping until they left. A lot of people, who I considered mutual friends, have also deleted me off of facebook.

I don't know what to do now or what to feel. I have to find a new place now because I can't afford this one. But I feel like I destroyed the best thing that had ever happened to me and I can't get over the feeling that I made a massive mistake. I always considered myself a loyal, caring and loving girlfriend- but I feel like I can't even ever claim that now because I might have abandoned the love of my life. However, at the same time I feel like a rock has just feel lifted off of my chest.

 
**tl;dr**: Broke it off. People hate me. He got released, got his stuff and left without saying anything. I am just so sad I don't know what to tell you."
"[Update] My fiancée's best friend's boyfriend asked us [24 M &amp; 24F] to back out of our trip with them so he could attempt to rekindle their struggling relationship. He offered to give us a full refund and even extra to cost the inconvenience. Unsure how to proceed.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbrfi/my_fiancées_best_friends_boyfriend_asked_us_24_m/

Mia and I didn't end up going on the trip to New Orleans with Sarah and John, after posting we really thought about it and a lot of the comments were right that we would likely have a horrible trip and be blamed for if they did happen to break up. John didn't end up telling Sarah about the drastic change of plans which pretty much put it on us (More specifically me to tell her the news).

Mia said she was dreading telling her best friend that her boyfriend had asked us to back out of the trip so I offered to do it for her. I talked to Mia about it and I told her how I was going to do it and in general what I had planned to say. I didn't know if I wanted to telling her how it was and call it a day or if I actually wanted to try to fix / put Sarah's relationship into perspective. Sarah is a very pretty girl there's no denying that but her biggest flaw is how she treats people. I try my best not to judge because I don't know how she ended up the way she is now, and according to Mia she wasn't always so standoffish and inconsiderate. I actually remember when I first met her years ago thinking she was a surprisingly decent person. 

Anyways I had lunch with her Friday and pretty much told her that we were going to be backing out of the trip and that John wanted her to go with her on the trip to spend some quality time together. She overacted as I assumed she would and immediately got angry and wanted to call John out for being so selfish and requesting something so unreasonable of us. I told her that it wasn't that big of a deal and that we could always do something smaller later on during the summer and that I advised that she consider going with him.

Eventually she calmed down and started asking me for relationship advice, something I've purposely never given her because I always felt it wasn't my place to tell her anything. I don't like giving relationship advice in general because everyone's relationship is a little different and everyone is willing to put up with different things. I start telling her about Mia and I and about the small things we do for each other and how we try our best to communicate and just small talk about it really. I tell her why I think we're successful and how we're a team.

And she says something along the lines of ""You sound so amazing and I wish John would do something like that for me."" I call her out in a friendly/joking way that she shouldn't say things like that especially not to her boyfriend. ""If I didn't know any better I'd say you might be wishing you were with me."" totally joking around with her trying to lighten the mood without scolding her even though her saying that is like a huge issue.

She laughs and then there is a long pause followed by silence, and that's when everything pretty much started to click about her relationship, her behavior with John and all that other stuff. She never actually admitted it but I basically tell her that if she really loves John that she shouldn't attempt to throw away her 7 year relationship on a maybe or a possibly because there is a high chance that it will never be more than just that. I think she pretty much got the message.

She did get a little upset I figure it probably was the first time someone had preemptively turned her down or maybe she realized how much she had ruined her relationship. She pretty much told me to be honest about the state of her relationship and if I really thought that there was an chance she could fix it. I told her I think it would take a lot of work but if she was willing to self-reflect that she definitely save them. I told her she should talk to Mia because honestly she could give a better insight. 

She did talk to Mia as well shortly after our little lunch thing and I guess between Mia and I something went right because John and Sarah went on the trip New Orleans by themselves and they came back and they both genuinely seem happy with one another. I'm sure it's too early to say if they are just riding the vacation high or if they'll really last but John gave me the most bromantic hug I've ever received in my life when they came back and thanked me for whatever I did/said.

Mia and I ended up taking a brief trip to New York by train from July 2nd &amp; 3rd to do some light shopping and for the rest of the week we actually decided to to take her 2 younger siblings and their best friends to beach for a couple days which they all seemed to enjoy. And we did end up giving John back the extra money he gave us.


Thanks for the advice, crsis adverted.

**TL;DR:** We backed out of the trip, I broke the news to Sarah and we helped put her relationship into perspective. John and Sarah had a great time in New Orleans and seem to be on the right track with fixing their relationship. Mia and I went to New York for a few days and then took her younger siblings and their best friends to the beach.

"I'm [16 F] living with my sister [26 F] and her husband [29 M], I'm doing all the housework and her husband doesn't like it and is threatening her with a divorce. Am I wrong to take him up on his offer to support me until I'm 18?


Sorry if the title isn't clear but I'm not really sure how I should how worded it.

I've been living with my sister [Lauren] and her husband [Frank] for about 2 years now, when our parents passed away they took me in with open arms which I was extremely grateful for. I know my sister and her husband made a huge sacrifice to their relationship taking me in. I was actually a bit surprised my sister wanted to take me in at all, she seemed overeager to bring me into their home. I only say this because previously, she wanted nothing to do with me.

I've been actively doing housework since the first week of moving in with them to pull my own weight to the best of my ability typically I rotate duties with my sister between wash dishes, vacuum, laundry, taking out the trash, paying their bills own online, etc. My sister is a stay-at-wife so I guess her job/duty is basically to keep the house running and everything like that.

About 4 months ago she had some friends visit from out of the country and stay with us for about 2 weeks, her best friend, her best friend's husband,  and two other people who I didn't know quite as well. During this time my sister asked me if I could pick up her half of the housework so she could spend time with her friends/guest. I had no issue covering for her so for those 2 weeks I did everything from paying bills, to grocery shopping to laundry and all the other stuff the house needed. She never mentioned this to Frank directly from what I can understand because after the first week he pulled me aside and asked me why I was doing so much around the house and what Lauren had been up to.

I explained to him that I was merely covering for her so that she could enjoy time with her friends and that I **did not** mind the bit of extra work and it was the least I could do for her since she seemed like she was having such a good time with her friends. Well, the two weeks past and her friends leave but my sister is still recovering from all the fun and partying that they did (Literally seemed like they drank every single night or went out) so I kept doing her half of the housework.

One day Frank comes home early around like 11am, and he sees that I'm currently folding their clothes in the living room. He goes in their room and sees my sister asleep in their bed still (She'd been sleeping pretty much to noon or later) since her friends visited and hadn't been doing much at all. Frank talks to me for a bit and I try to cover for Lauren telling him that she just hasn't been feeling well or anything like that but I can tell Frank is clearly quite upset and knows that Lauren has been doing nothing for the past couple weeks. 

I tell him I **do not** mind doing the chores and that if anything it's something to keep my busy during my down time in the summer. He tells me that he told her explicitly that she was not suppose to do this, apparently my sister told him when I first moved in that she was going to have me do chores while my sister pursued some type of crafting. 

Anyways Frank and Lauren have been fighting about it a lot, Lauren doesn't think Frank should mind that I'm doing all the housework, ""As long as it gets done who cares who does it. It's not your problem.""

Frank is basically saying that he didn't marry her and allow her to be a stay-at-home-wife so that she could be lazy and do nothing with herself. He wants her to do the house work because that is her job to do it and that if she doesn't want to do it then she's free to get herself a full-time job and then they'll both just split the chores. He thinks Lauren is pretty much using me and treating me poorly by making me do her work.

I'm trying to stay out of it because I feel like I'm at fault for this, I did inconvenience them and I know my presence probably affects my sister and their relationship greatly. I've tried talking to Lauren but she seems so stubborn that she doesn't care what I have to say and doesn't want anything to do with me. She seemed stressed or angry and I'm not really sure why, her and Frank have been talking about it a lot and I just try to mind my own business.

Last week Lauren and Frank both approached me at separate times, Lauren told me that she didn't know what was going to happen between her and Frank and that if they did divorce that she would be taking me with her and moving to some part of Europe to stay with her best friend who visited. Honestly I didn't want to do it and she said that at first we might have to live on our own just the two of us while arrangements were made to accommodate us.

Frank approached me and told me that I was a good kid and that he was truly sorry that I had to be in the middle of their martial issues. He said that he would try to keep things as civil as possible and that I had nothing to worry about. He offered to basically support me until I turned 18(?) and could access the money that my parents had left for me. He told me that I didn't have to go with Lauren should they happen to divorce (I guess he knew she would be leaving overseas?).

I feel guilty to even admit that I've been considering Frank's offer more than I should. I feel like I'm being such a bad person/sister because I know I owe my sister big time but she doesn't seem to really have herself to together right now. I fear that going with her pretty much means watching her crash and burn or me having to carry my weight and hers which is unrealistic at the moment and I don't want to move to Europe if it's possible.

I haven't mentioned it to my sister yet but I know she's going to think it's pure betrayal and likely hold it against me. But, am I really wrong for considering what Frank told me?

**TL;DR:** My sister and her husband might be getting divorced purely due to her laziness(Can't think of a better word). If they divorce she is moving to Europe to be with her best friend and wants me to come. Her husband has offered to support me until I turned 18 and could live on my own.

"Me [32 M] with my wife [31 F] of 5 years, could be getting divorced over an aquarium.


Throwaway account for personal reasons.


To start off, my wife and I have been together for 5 years, and things were going pretty great…until recent events. We met during speed dating and both quickly took a liking to each other. We both have great jobs and plan on having kids pretty soon, maybe within the next 2-3 years. Also, we don’t disagree on many things, and rarely argue (sometimes of course). 


So, my wife and I just bought a house in Florida, and she is crazy about anything aquatic. I’m talking whales, fish, lobsters, she just loves all things of the sea. One of the first things that she told me about herself on our first official date was that she “Loved the Seals”. I’m not quite sure what this was supposed to mean. Was it some type of save-the-seals slogan you might hear for pandas? Anyways, that didn’t really strike me as too odd since I am an animal lover myself. In our first apartment we had a quaint fish tank that housed around ten fish, but she always wanted more fish in that damn tank. I said, “Look, we can’t have any more fish in that tank! They need their space!”. She agreed, and the issue has not been brought up since, until now.


As I said above, we just recently bought a house in Florida. One of the most striking features that we love about it is the giant pool. It isn’t the greatest looking pool but it is definitely large. One of the first things she mentions AFTER we purchase the place is “how cool it would be to have our own aquarium”. I go on to tell her that it is not a wise idea for us to have an aquarium, for various reasons. It did not seem to make her extremely angry but I could tell that she was a bit annoyed and frustrated about the whole ordeal. A few days later she brings it up to me again, except this time she had a legitimate plan all written out. I’m was taken aback; she used Word to type up a detailed plan on how we could get this “aquarium” to work, bullet points n all. It went over the costs, the types of aquatic creatures we would house in the aquarium, what type of contractors and licenses we need to pull it off. The craziest part: she wants to use the POOL.


I told her that I thought it was really sweet that her love for aquatic creatures has given her the idea to have our own aquarium in our pool, but wasn’t willing to spend nearly $20,000 to do so, nor would I do it regardless of the cost. The most fucked up part is that she wants sharks in a separate pool that we would have to build. Why the hell would anyone want giant sharks in their backyard? She told me that this was one of her dreams ever since we had met, that we would own a pool and start up some type of backyard aquarium bullshit. Her first sign was apparently “You said you loved the seals too”. 


So now I am thinking in my head that I married somebody so that they could have a potential aquarium partner? She has now gone as far as saying that she will leave me if I don’t agree to this. I don’t even know what to do at this point… She claims that I am “crushing her dreams”. I am just so confused about all of this. We have been great for 5 going on 6 years and she wants to leave me because I won’t agree to having an aquarium and building a separate pool for sharks? 


Is it even wise to try and work this out anymore? I feel like I am being put into a corner right now and cannot do anything about it. She won’t even pick up my phone calls. Should I cave and build the aquarium? I need your help Reddit.





   
**tl;dr**: Wife is threatening to leave me if I don’t agree to building an aquarium in our backyard."
"Me [34M] with my GF and her daughter[37/9 F/F] my gf's daughter no longer wants to spend time with me alone in public b/c i'm not white.


This whole thing Sucks and i really have no idea what to do. My gf and i have been together for ~8 years. I love her and her daughter (who i consider my own) and honestly cant immagine my life without them. That said, things have gotten really tough with Milly (daughter) recently. 

For as long as we've been together, it has always been hard to be seen in public with Milly alone. She is blond, with blue eyes and clearly not biologically mine. I am a very dak skinned indian man and i wear a turban( im sikh)  Whenever we are in public alone together we get stopped and questioned, A LOT. For the last few years i've been stopped and questioned by the Police at least once a month with Milly. Its the same every time, they separate us, ask me bullshit questions and (now that she is old enough to speak her mind) grill Milly about me and how she knows me. When Milly was too young to understand things and express herself clearly there was an incident where I was Arrested after taking her into a family bathroom to change her diaper and Milly was placed into state care for several hours until the cops could reach her mom to sort things out. 

The justification they used then was the fact that Milly was really upset/crying when we came out of the bathroom and even after her mom sorted things out, she was  visited by a social worker for a few months. Nothing that bad has happened since milly started talking but the questioning by police hasnt stopped. It has gotten to the point where Milly now actively avoids going out in public with me alone and has asked her mom if she can hire a white nanny to pick her up from camp/drop her off this summer so that I wont have to. I honestly dont know what to do. I know that milly loves me and that she still wants to spend time with me, but i dont know how i should respond to her request. 

To me Milly is my daughter. I've been around since she was a baby amd have been active in raising her. I know that she is still too young to understand things but i cant help but feel terrible about her request. Since she asked last night i havent been able to sleep. I dont want her to grow up hating the fact that i look different. I dont want her to be afraid of going out with me. I dont really know what advice I need, anything is helpful. I just dont know what to do. 

Tl;dr**: my girlfriends daughter who i consider my own has asked if we can get a white nanny to take her out in public so she wont have to be out alone with me. Idk what to do "
"UPDATE: My [26M] wife [25F] of one year has been incredibly selfish and inconsiderate towards me during our entire relationship and added the last straw by neglecting me after I underwent surgery.

"UPDATE: Me [25M] with my GF [24F] of 1.5 years. She brought home a kitten after 9 months of me saying ""No""


My original post on the matter [can be found here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o6mdd/me_25_m_with_my_gf_24_f_of_15_years_she_brought/) along with the TL;DR.

Short update: We broke up last night. We both love each other still, but she believes that it's what is best for her.

Long update: Shortly after I posted my original thread, I got home from work and found the kitten(GF had already left for work before I got home). Because it was so young and playful, it mewed when I left it in the kitchen/living room with the doors closed to the bedroom so that it wouldn't wake me while I slept during the day. It was heartbreaking to feel like I was ignoring her and the thought of no one being able to play and care for her was exactly what I feared about getting a pet when I said to my girlfriend that I didn't think we were ready yet. Before I fell asleep, I texted my gf at work telling her all of this and how awful it made me feel. I fell asleep.

When I woke up, I read through the comments that all of you left me, laid in bed for a little bit, and then GF came home. I reiterated how badly it made me feel not being able to take care of the little kitten and how it only solidified in my head that we weren't ready for a pet. I took some suggestions that others had offered, such as giving her a hard expectancy date for when we *could* get a pet and what stipulations would allow that, but she didn't want to hear it. I asked her to bring it back, give it to her parents or someone else, but she just flat out said, ""No."" 

We argued about some of the stuff I mentioned in the original post about how she felt I was more of a figurehead and some other things until I took a shower. I considered everything you guys had said(some of which I did or did not agree with), as well as my own thoughts on the matter, and when I stepped out of the shower, she had fallen asleep on the couch. For another half hour I thought about things over and over in my mind, until I finally made the decision I felt there was no going back from. I walked up to her, she woke up, and I said, ""**I don't think this is a healthy relationship anymore and I think you should move out,**"" and then I walked out. -This was 3 weeks ago...

That first night was the hardest for me. I missed her next to me in bed, especially when I came home from work in the morning, and being with her doing every day things like grocery shopping and at that point wasn't sure if I actually wanted this. She moved in with a friend because she doesn't have family from around here, and we were texting semi-regularly about our relationship and she said that she thought it was best we didn't live together for now. She said she felt like she was in an abusive relationship. Not physically, but emotionally. That because I asked her to move out, it took away the safety she felt while with me. I told her that if I had a child who felt like they were in an abusive relationship, I wouldn't want them to be with their partner either, so if that was her decision, I would support it. I knew that wouldn't be good for our psuedo-relationship, but I agreed that it might be better she move out.

The 2nd week we got together a couple times and talked face to face. She admitted that it was wrong to bring home a pet like she did without me on board. She also told me she bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 2 of them before her friend told her to throw it out. Before that, she hadn't smoked in over a year because I asked her not to anymore. It killed me because I really thought she wanted to make those kinds of positive steps in her life for more than just me, but I was wrong. All of this sent things in the wrong direction again, despite it seeming like we were actually going to try and work on our dynamic and make things healthier for both of us.

This past weekend we went to a friend's engagement party together. Things were ok there, but the following days she went camping with her family and then came over to see me last night. I had a feeling things weren't going to be the same. We had stop texting frequently, rarely saw each other over the last few weeks, and when we did talk, it was mostly platonic subjects. It felt over and I felt lost. Last night she told me she thinks we should break up. She felt that we have too much baggage and we'd be too resentful of one another to be able to continue forward. I thought we were on the verge of working through things, but I guess she did not. She said she still wants things to be amicable because we were, afterall, great friends. I told her that I couldn't be just friends and it would hurt too much to see what she's doing and with whom, without me too. We both still love each other. We both told each other that. I told her that I probably will always love her. We hugged for a couple minutes and then she left.

**TL;DR**: My GF and I broke up. We both love each other and there will be so many different things that I think back on and smile about, but evidently, love is not enough.

One more thing I'd like to say is that I appreciate everyone who lent a hand with offering advice and consolation in my previous thread. But I would also like to say that matters of the heart are never as clear as you'd like them to be. The advice I read was often in black or white and rarely forgiving, despite what side of the story folks agreed with. So I urge you all to at least consider approaching matters in this sub with a softer heart at times and the benefit of a doubt when giving advice. Once again, thank you all."
"I [16M] just had my ex and best friend [16F&amp;M] come into my work and tell me they are both leaving me for each other. They also asked me if I could not go to the circus tonight that I bought tickets for


I have to kinda keep this short as humanly possible. I am still working but my boss has given me 20 minutes to myself. 

I am going into my junior year at high school and I need to know how to cope with this. My boss said she would let me go home but she really needs me here. So I was serving customers as usual when I see my girlfriend and best friend walk in. They tell they are both leaving me for each other. They told me and I quote "" we like you, great person but we like each other more""

I just stood their stunned beyond belief, then they had the balls to ask me not to go to the circus that I bought their tickets for. It's 6:30 now and I get off at eight and I planned on meeting them there. There is a circus in town and I had never been to one so I wanted to go 

They did this while other customers and co workers were around, I have never been so embarrassed in all my life and I just don't know what to do

"My [26 M] wife [24F] has a crush on a male co-worker and lies to me so she can spend more time with him


We have been married for less than a year, dating for almost four and have a toddler together (she is everything to us).

We both work at the same coffee shop and money is very tight for us, so we share a car and a phone. I will work the morning shift and my wife will work the night shift. We usually have a two-hour gap between shifts so that we can comfortably get home and spend a little bit of time together.

My wife has a crush on her male co-worker, which I have known about since it started a few months ago. I don't want to be that crazy jealous guy, so I figured she can talk to whomever she wants as long as it never crosses a line. I don't ever want to tell her that she cannot talk to someone. But most of our co-workers know, which puts me in an awkward spot between pretending to be oblivious to it or be the 'jealous boyfriend' type.

Recently, it has gotten worse. She will find ways to cover and switch shifts so that she works with him more often. This week I caught lying about something our boss said, so that she can find a way to work with this co-worker again. She now sees him 4-5 times per week, and we only see each other for two nights per week

Normally, I would be able to handle this better, but I recently caught her talking to an ex-boyfriend. I walked into the room and she turned the laptop around and told me I couldn't see what she was doing cause she was shopping for Father's Day presents for me. I  knew something was up, and snooped on her Facebook. It was innocent enough, just a casual Facebook conversation, and she didn't hide it once confronted and considered it bad judgement to not give me a heads up she was messaging an ex on Facebook. So on top of everything else I now have some big trust issues.

My biggest fear is confronting my wife about this, because I am afraid she will pack up and leave with the baby and the car (which is her name). And it is so embarrassing to have to see my co-workers every day, most of whom know about this crush.
   
Tl,DR: My wife has lied to me to see her crush more often and I have major trust issues because I have caught her lying before. How do I confront her? Should I confront her?

Edit: I have started talking to her. In the middle of a fight right now. She is probably mad that I am on the computer during the fight.

Edit 2: We talked things out. She said it is not emotionally cheating, but admitted that she would be mad if the tables were turned. We agreed she needs to find a new place of work and at the same time work on the marriage. She has an interview tomorrow with a former boss, but for now we need the money, so she is at work with the other guy."
"My [25F] boyfriend [26M] serenaded his co-worker


We've been together for 2 years and we live together. We had people over for the 4th and he invited some of his friends from work. One of the friends is a girl who is obviously very pretty and everyone loves her because she's a fun person to be around. We all had a lot to drink and my boyfriend and one of our friends were playing guitar and I was sitting in the pool with some of the other people. My boyfriend starts playing this song, and I wish I remembered what it was, but it was basically about how hot this girl is and how he wants to fuck her but she's too high maintenance for him. And he was singing it right to his coworker and replaced whatever the name of the girl in the song's was with her name. He was like leaning over her and she was staring up at him completely loving it. After it was done my friends were like ""holy shit are you okay with that?"" But obviously I wasn't going to do anything right then. 


After we got out of the pool my boyfriend and the girl and a couple other people got in. I looked over and she was sitting on his shoulders with her legs wrapped around his neck, and I also saw her doing the thing that you would do with a kid where you hold them on your lap and they push off your legs and you throw them (hope that makes sense). Honestly the whole night made me uncomfortable and all of my friends were blown away by how they were blatantly flirting in front of me. 


I brought it up with him yesterday and he said they're just friends and were just having fun and that I'm overreacting.  I worry about how they are together at work if that's how they behave in front of me. Does it sound wildly inappropriate to anyone else or am I overreacting? They don't get together outside of work often and when they do its in a big group so I don't want to ask him to stop seeing her but is there some sort of compromise we could reach? It seemed like he was only a couple of beers away from cheating on me. 


**tl;dr**: my boyfriend and his coworker seem to be way too flirty but I don't know how to get it to stop. "

"My [23F] father and brother [61M&amp;29M] reduced our brothers [24M] fiancee [24F] to tears for being a former cam model. My mother expects me to play peacemaker


My brothers fiancee is absolutely draw dropping gorgeous, you can tell she is head over heels for my brother. She always has this big smile on her face when he is around and he treats her well. He would never hit her, never yells at her, they are a perfectly healthy couple that met in college. 

Her English is kinda broken because she comes from the Ukraine, she moved to America when she was 19 with her mom. As the story goes she was forced to be a cam model by her ex abusive boyfriend. He would beat the crap out of her if she did not basically show herself naked on cam to other men. He got arrested for distributing meth and she met my brother not long after that. 

Unfortunately someone put videos of her up on pornhub and xhamster. My brother found them and showed them to our father. The very short version of events is we had a 4th of July party.  They basically asked her a whole bunch of humiliating questions when my brother was away talking to me and some friends. They shoved a video of her in her face with his phone.
'
She ran to my brother and she looked really upset and she started to cry. My brother went into the house and basically all hell broke loose. He ripped my father and brother a new one and he told them both to fuck off. They left and they worse part of it was they were going to tell everyone they are expecting their first child. 

She is several weeks pregnant and they were going to tell everyone while friends and family were gathered in one place. 
My mother expects me to play peacemaker between the family. She wants me to get them talking again and I don't know how too. I think I should leave it alone

"Update: I [16M] just had my ex and best friend [16F&amp;M] come into my work and tell me they are both leaving me for each other. They also asked me if I could not go to the circus tonight that I bought tickets for


Link to original problem:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rlzg9/i_16m_just_had_my_ex_and_best_friend_16fm_come/

Hi everybody, thanks for all your help &amp; support. I have my friend Jade with me right now, she is my best friends ex girlfriend and we both need to know what to do. 

Our exes Summer and Jordan aka the rats, did not wind up going to the circus. I went with my friend Kelsie and I had fun with her there. I think they may have gone and saw me and decided to leave. When I got home I decided to call Jade and see if she knew what was going on. 

She was painfully aware, Jordan dumped her over Facebook. So with Jade they took the cowards way out and did it where she could not cause a scene, and they did the exact same thing with me at my work. We both feel like we wasted 2 and a half years of our lifes with them. The sad thing is we were both asked out by other people during this time, but we turned them down because of our partners. 

Summer and Jordan have posted on Facebook about how they are going down to Florida for a week or two. So they have been doing stuff behind our backs and we had no idea. They were and this is the part that hurts the most and we feel really alone.

Our friends knew about them, they knew Summer and Jordan have been together behind our backs for 6 months now. When we were at work those two were on dates/fooling around and they told people. Our friends excuses was "" we thought it was best you figure it out for yourselves""

They had the balls to probably fuck each other and then come running back to us. We told my mother about this and my mom is awesome. I can talk to her about anything and she thinks we better go get tested. If they cheated on us then who else did they sleep with. Is it necessary to get tested?

So we have no real friends and our partners were rats. We don't know what to do with ourselves anymore. Jade is staying the night at my place and we were going to go swimming in my pool, or sit in the hot tub and order pizza. But we just feel so betrayed by everyone 

**tl;dr: Went to the circus had fun. Friends news my ex girlfriend and ex best friend were seeing each other. For 6 months they knew and did not say anything**

"Me [24 F] with my husband [25M] of 1.5 years just hit me for the first time.




Second Mini Update: Talked with husband some more, his attitude shifted. He went from saying he will never drink again to ""I'll stop if you really want me to."" He also went from thinking it was something stupid he did to saying it was my fault for provoking him. I brought up going to therapy but he doesn't want to go because he says there's nothing wrong with him. I brought up the time he grabbed my throat when we were dating. He starting yelling at me saying he didn't put his hands on me. I somewhat stupidly walked him through that incident and what happened and his response was: well it doesn't count because I was just angry and drunk and lost control, I didn't set out to hurt you. This is when I realized it really is time to leave.





Please forgive any errors. This is my first post and I'm a little hysterical at the moment to be honest. 

First, I want to set the stage for what happened tonight. Back in December my parents told my husband and I that they would pay for us to go and stay at a nice hotel at the beach for our Christmas present. This is the week we choose to go so I have been excitedly awaiting this trip for months! The past few days have been amazing and we were particularly impressed with how nice the resort is and really blown away by my parents generosity.

Things turned bad earlier today when my husband told me he wanted to drink. I was hesitant because he doesn't always know his limits and I end up babysitting him sometimes. However, he persuaded me to the point that I purchased the alcohol and even had a few shots myself even though I'm not a big drinker. At first we were both having a great time drinking and playing in the ocean. Then he finished the bottle and started doing some really embarrassing things. Soon after it got dark and I suggested we go back to the room. He liked that idea and ran there leaving me to gather, carry and clean our cooler, beach back and floats. I was pretty irritated at this point. When I get to the room I find him waiting in the hallway completely covered in sand with a huge pile around him. I tell him he needs to get in the shower as soon as we go in so he doesn't make more of a mess. He agrees, however gets out shortly after still covered in sand and jumps right into bed. I tell him to get back in the shower and he tells me to fuck off but eventually goes in anyway and locks the door. About twenty minutes go by and the water is still running. I yell into him to turn the water off and go to bed. He complies and crawls out miraculously still covered in sand and now also vomit. He proceeds to vomit again on the carpet. I tell him he needs to get back in the tub and that I will help clean him. He says ""fuck off bitch"" and tries to push me show can get to bed. I stand my ground and tell him shower first.

I want to pause and point out that I would not normally stand up for myself like this but I was really worried about my parents getting a fine for the room being left a mess. That fear was making me brave and a little bit bossy. 

He keeps trying to push me to no avail and finally hits me hard on my arm. I'm shocked but still brace myself in an attempt to lead him to the shower one last time. At this point he grabs me trigger around the throat with both hands and slams me onto the floor. I gave up then and he fell asleep immediately.

What I want to know is was he out of line for doing that? If yes what do I do? How likely is this to happen again?

tl;dr: Husband drunkenly puts his hands on me after I bother him about washing off before bed. Is he out of line?



Mini Update: Husband woke up and is currently in the shower. When he first woke up and asked why I was on the floor I told him about everything he did the night before. Initially his reaction was shock and he started to cry but got over it in a few seconds and said I must have been imaging everything because he did not get that drunk. I had him check the bathroom for vomit then he believed me. He apologized and said he will never drink again as some of you predicted. However, he doesn't seem to really think it's a big deal and has an attitude of ""there I go with my drunken shenanigans again, lol, what can you do?""

If I hadn't posted here I probably would have brushed it off too. I'm so thankful for all the support I've gotten from y'all. I'm going to try to make it through the next couple of days with out doing much. I don't have any friends of my own and my mom has health issues so I don't want to worry her too much until I can actually be there with her.

"I [45F] don't want to pay for my stepdaughter's [18F] college because I have no relationship with her. My husband [46M] disagrees.


My husband and I got married 2 years ago. He has two daughters, one who is in her late-20s and the other (Sara) is 18. I have a son and a daughter from a previous marriage who are 10 and 14. My son and daughter live with me &amp; my husband. My husband's older daughter lives with her husband in another state &amp; is financially independent and his younger daughter lives with her mom about an hour away. 

My husband's eldest daughter was in her mid-20s when I met her and we get along well, she's a nice girl and we have similar personalities. My husband's younger daughter Sara was 17 when we got married and I haven't had much of a bond with her. She was very rude to me in the beginning but has since calmed down a bit. She has a lot of loyalty to her mom, so she's just kind of living her own life and doing her teenage/young adult stuff and isn't looking for a mother figure in her new stepmom. Sara visits our house once or twice a year, but meets up with her dad/my husband all the time.

Sara graduated high school this year and a couple of months ago asked my husband what he could put towards her college education. My husband said he would get back to her on it. That night he said ""Well, we're gonna need to give at least $20K to Sara, I don't want her saddled down with student loans. Kristen (his ex-wife) said she can cover $5K and we'll have to give the rest."" My husband makes about 1/4 of what I do, so I asked him, ""Do you have that much money saved up?"" (Reference: We keep our finances separate). He said ""No, aren't you going to help out?""

This is where I'm going to sound really bad but honestly I don't have much of a relationship at all with Sara. She was 17 when we met and she had no interest in talking to me, so I stopped trying to reach out after a while. While I do make a lot more money than my husband does, I also pay a lot more of the bills, which I've never held over his head. I'll be honest, I could afford the $15K a year for Sara's college, but I have ZERO contact with her and haven't had a 1 on 1 conversation lasting more than 10 minutes with her ever. I feel that money would be better used saving it for our immediate family. On a side note, I've never asked my husband to pay anything for my kids. 

My husband is upset and this has been an issue now for a few months. 
   
**tl;dr: My husband &amp; I keep our finances separate and now he wants me to contribute to my stepdaughter's college fund. I don't have a relationship with her at all and she's been rude to me in the past. Should I give her the money?**"
"How do I (23F) get it across to my husband (25M) that him being tired is not the same as when I'm tired?


Using my novelty account because my husband knows my main.

I am currently four months pregnant with me and my husband's first child. The first trimester was really rough. I slept about twelve to fourteen hours a day and lost about 15 pounds from morning sickness. Ever since getting into my second trimester it has only improved slightly. I don't constantly feel sick, but I have no appetite and trying to eat with no appetite makes me sick.

My husband recently talked to me about me slacking in my part of the housework. We both work full time and split the housework evenly. I fully admit and own that I've let my duties slip and promised him I would work harder at doing my part. My problem is this:

I explained to him the reason I've let things slip is I'm exhausted. The baby is taking most of my energy and fueling my body is hard because of my loss of appetite. I don't sleep as much as I did, but I still go to bed super early. I told him I was sorry and it wasn't an excuse to let things go, but I needed him to understand I was very tired. He responded with, ""Yeah, I'm tired too sometimes."" 

He suggests working out and eating certain foods to give me energy, but doesn't seem to get that I don't have the energy to do anything but crash after a full day of work and errands.

I don't think he understands that there is a monumental difference between our versions of ""tired"". He is a wonderful and supportive husband and has been great through this pregnancy, but he just doesn't seem to understand that when I say the baby has taken all my energy, I literally mean ALL of it. How can I get him to realize that I'm exhausted?

tl;dr- Husband doesn't seem to understand how exhausting my pregnancy is. How do I get him to understand?"

"My husband (36M) and I (32F) stayed with friends this weekend, heard him and her (32F) late at night


This past weekend my husband and I went to visit friends of ours out of state, another couple. He and I have been married six years and together for 8 total. Our marriage has always felt pretty stable and I thought we were happy. My husband and I have very different personalities, I am extremely outgoing, can be attention seeking, have ADHD and constantly need stimulation. He's very much the opposite but we have always made it work. We went to therapy last year and came up with a solution, I often talk with people over the internet when he isn't around. It's always platonic and appropriate, he can always check them if necessary. I've never had anything to hide, he doesn't mind that I use the messaging apps (or reddit) to go on. 

Recently, past three months or so, we haven't been having much sex. I have tried to initiate conversations, suggest changes (frequency, type), offering to stop talking to other people all together, changing things, but nothing. He says he is just stressed and doesn't want to have sex. It has caused some tension and has forced me to pull back a bit. 


Anyway, back on track. Saturday night we were staying with our friends and sleeping on an air mattress in their study/den type room. I fall asleep early since I get up super early every morning while my husband is more of a night owl. Well, I woke up randomly at 1am and couldn't sleep. I could hear my husband talking very very quietly so moved to see if I could hear him. He was talking to my very good friend (32F), they were discussing me. Mostly how he isn't happy and he doesn't know how to talk to me and how coming to see her is a bad idea. That we never should have come, that it's hard seeing her like this. That he misses her. On and on about this. He was a bit frantic and she didn't say anything for about five minutes. I couldn't hear great honestly, and admittedly maybe misheard some, as I was hiding in the next room over so they couldn't hear or see me there. But then she started telling him that they should have told me in the beginning, that they couldn't go back there right now, she loves him always but not right now, they are trying for a baby (I assume her and her husband), she misses him too. I don't know what they are talking about, they didn't know each other before we were dating and I don't particularly remember them being close or anything at some point. I wasn't drunk, high or under any influence, but I didn't hear everything. She only moved three hours away a year ago, so possibly this happened when they lived closer? I feel like I am trying to justify or explain away what I heard, but it was clear that at some point they were sleeping together, or having some form of an affair.

I didn't say anything yesterday but he was fine. We held hands, kissed, cuddled, and had an overall good day with our friends. Today we drove home really early this morning, and I asked him about the weekend, if he was happy with how it went, if we were okay, pretty much the general answer was ""fine, okay, yes, of course we are good babe."" Nothing out of the ordinary. But it's still bugging me, I don't know what to do or who to ask what I should. I feel like I should straight out ask him, but then part of me thinks I should ask her first?  



   
**tl;dr**: Heard my husband and friend talking, think that they are either having an affair or had one, not sure how to handle it. "
"How do I [28M] cope with my sister [12F] having her first boyfriend [12M]?


I'm my little sister's guardian at the moment and I've pretty much taken on a fatherly role towards her. Unfortunately, six years ago both of our parents died in a car accident. It was so hard for me, but it was even harder for her honestly. I'd had 22 years with my parents and I enjoyed being their child and I still have tons of memories to cherish of them. On the other hand, my sister didn't really have that much time to be with them, and I find it unfair.

At the time I was directly out of college and working at an decently paying entry level job. I made it my mission to raise my sister, because I knew that it would be what my parents wanted and I felt a sense of duty to her as her older brother. I took her to a child therapist to help her properly cope with the grief.

While parenting a child by myself initially took some time to get used to, having a great support system around me made the transition very easy. Our family was always willing to help out by babysitting whenever I needed it, having female member educate her about women issues, or just giving me the night off and helping her with her homework and making her dinner.

Two weeks ago, my sister came home from school and told me that she had great news to tell me. I asked her what it was and she said that a boy in her class had asked her out and she said yes. She told me that he invited her to go see a movie together and she needed me to take them because it was PG-13. I took them and he seemed like a nice enough kid and I really had no objections to make.

Recently, I started thinking about it and I honestly just burst out in tears crying. I'm not upset that she's dating someone, that is perfectly normal. However, the thought of her growing up soon and being on the road to adulthood just makes me so sad for some reason. Its like, we have had six great years together that have blown by really quickly and in just six short more years she will be an adult. Just thinking about it makes me sad and nostalgic for those times when she was still that innocent little girl.

Other people who have experience in raising children, is this kind of feeling normal? What is the proper way to cope with it?

**TL;DR**: The concept of my little sister growing up has really been bumming me out lately."
"how to tell family and friends that I (22/f) have cancer and I'm going on hopsice


After a couple months of mystery symptoms, a disbelieving and apathetic PCP, finally some referrals to specialists, and fighting for PA's for various tests, my mystery illness finally got a name: ovarian cancer! Not what I was hoping for. I had an initial consult with a gyn oncologist yesterday, he said stage IV with about 6 months to live. He recommended going on hospice, as palliative treatments would only extend my lifespan another six months and I would spend a lot of that time as sick as a dog. I haven't told any family or friends about this because I don't think it's fully sunk in for me yet-- I'm comfortably numb right now and I should probably find a way to come to terms with it first.


I'm probably going to take the hospice option (going to think for another day or so though) and this is where I need some help from you guys: I'm already dreading telling people about my diagnosis, but justifying my decision to not ""fight"" it sounds like a huge nightmare. Some people I tell are not going to take that part well. What's the best way to put it so that they understand this is my dx and my decision, without disregarding the fact that this is going to be really hard on them too?


Here are some other questions: How do I handle notifying friends-but-not-super-close-friends? It would feel weird giving them a call like I plan to do with my close friends, but I really don't want to do something like make a generic fb post. My parents are going to want me to move back home, and it's probably the right thing to do as my condition deteriorates, but how do I let them know I want to do it on my terms? I'm not ready to jump on the plane this moment. How do I let people know that I want to be treated as normally as possible? I don't even know if that's possible, seems like there is no normal anymore. And sounds really full of myself, but I imagine that people are going to want to maximize their time with me now, but I'm worried about being swamped and not being able to do the things I want to do. How do I politely say no without disregarding their feelings?


And please, any other advice you have would be so great right now. I'm so lost, I don't even know what to ask.

"My wife [27F] has asked me [29M] to stop talking to my best friend [28F], and is upset that I'm sad about it.


Callie and I have been friends for essentially our whole lives. We played together as children, we even had sleepovers as kids. She basically lived in my treehouse when her parents were going through a divorce, and when my cat died, she held me for hours while I cried. We were next door neighbors, and we were roommates in college. She's been part of every major life event of mine, and I've been part of hers. When I first met my wife, Callie was the one who I'd spend hours gushing about Laurie to, and she quickly and easily embraced Laurie. They've gotten along fantastically as far as I knew. 

When Callie met her husband, it was all very much the same. We welcomed him into our friend group, and had a bunch of fun as a couple of couples. We went on vacations together, did little day trips in our area, went on hikes and did other activities together. We had dinner with each other regularly, it was almost idyllic. 

Callie's husband, Chad, decided earlier this year to end his life. His death shook us all, but obviously, it shook Callie the most. It took my bubbly, optimistic, generally upbeat best friend and destroyed her. When she found out she was pregnant and then miscarried soon after, it destroyed her again. As her best friend, and essentially brother, she leaned on me a lot. She leaned on my wife too, and Laurie was happy to be there for her, but Callie leaned on me a bit harder. 

She's doing a lot better now, but she's not the same and I don't think she'll ever be quite the same ever again, and that's understandable. I still love her immensely, and I'll always be here for her, which I've communicated to her. We still have lunch together almost every day, and we text frequently. I've never hidden any of our interactions from my wife, and have actually gone to her several times to discuss them, because she gives amazing advice and I want her input. 

However, Laurie hit me with an ultimatum today. Either Callie goes, or she goes. She says that she can't handle knowing that I love another woman, the way I love Callie. I tried to explain that I love Callie the same way I love my brother. There's no romance to my love for her, and there's no attraction at all, on any level. I don't see her that way and I don't have the capacity to, because we grew up in such close proximity. We were over at each other's houses as kids all of the time and her mom even grounded me...on more than one occasion. That is how close our families are. She said that she doesn't care that this choice is hurting me, and it's a choice that I need to make. She says that I need to decide if a life with Callie as my friend is more important than a life with her, and to me, this feels exactly like someone saying ""Pick me or your sister.""

I'm sitting here at a crossroads. She has given me two days to grapple with this and make my choice, and I honestly don't know how to handle this. I don't want to lose either of them, because I love them both in such different ways. Callie is essentially my sister, and my wife is well...my *wife*. Laurie is the love of my life, and I'd be destroyed if I lost her. On the other hand, Callie is a lifelong friend, and losing her would wreck me too. I feel like I'm in an unfair situation. 

I've never spent time with Callie that my wife wasn't aware of, and she's *encouraged* me to go spend time with her when I was more apt to just stay home with Laurie. She's told me over and over again that she's proud of me for being so good to Callie and that seeing this proves to her that I'm a good man, because I don't just treat my wife well, I treat everyone in my life well. 

Laurie is currently upset that I'm even needing to think about this and has gone to the guest room. I've been instructed to leave her alone until I decide.

This feels like it's coming out of nowhere. It feels manipulative and hurtful and I'm frozen due to the shock and the pain of this situation. 

**tl;dr**: Wife very suddenly and out of the blue issued an ultimatum: life long friend or wife. Not sure how to proceed.

How do I even begin to digest this situation? What would you do in my situation? Is my wife being unreasonable, or am I? Are we both? Is there a middle ground that an outsider can see that I can't? Is there more to it than this? Is there something wrong with me that I didn't immediately choose my wife and I actually have to deeply think this through? "
"My MIL (55) keeps trying to make me (28F) into her pretty, pretty princess daughter, and my husband doesn't see a problem.


So, my MIL (55F) always wanted a girl but had 3 sons: Arthur (35M), Brian (32M), and my husband, Chris (28M). 

I am currently the only daughter in law. Arthur hasn't dated anyone seriously in years and will tell you he doesn't believe in marriage or kids -- he is a cool guy, travels the world and writes, enjoys his life, etc. Maybe someday his mortality will catch up to him and he'll settle down, but I wouldn't count on it. Arthur is pretty traditionally male in his interests (sports, beer, etc) outside of travel and even his travel is more adventure travel than anything else (not saying that's masculine, but my MIL is not very interested in it per se). Brian is gay and married, but both his husband and he are ""guys' guys"" -- really into sports, their house looks like a bachelor pad/frat house combo still, etc. They're super cute and fun to hang out with, but neither of them are doing any shopping, style, etc, stuff with my MIL. My husband is into a few cultural things and is a little less traditionally caveman masculine in his hobbies (he still doesn't want to go shopping or anything, but there's less of a ""steak and sports"" vibe from him, though we both still like both of those things!). He's the one his Mom at least taught to cook, for instance. I have very similar interests to my husband: Sci Fi, video games, sports, etc, except he likes cooking and I just like food (so he cooks, I clean, but I digress). We're DINKs and plan to keep it that way. I think Brian might want to adopt some day, so if she has grandkids those are her best bet, but they seem on the fence. 

For the time we dated and the first 3 years of our marriage (we've been together 6 years, married 3), we lived far enough away from my MIL that it was a non-issue. But recently we moved near her, and she is obsessively trying to get me to do girly things and kind of getting aggressive when I'm not interested. I was polite and went shopping with her a few time, got our nails done (I got a clear coat and refused the press on things adamantly and she got very upset!), etc, but she wants me to constantly get beauty treatments with her, go shopping, take cooking lessons, etc, and I am just not into it. She has never come over to play board games or gone to a science exhibit with me, or catered to any of my interests. She even gets mad if I have a beer with dinner when we go out to eat and don't want to get froo froo drinks and try hers instead. 

My husband has not been very supportive, saying she just wants to get to know me. I have tried to point out that whenever she ""gets to know me"", she doesn't seem to like me because I'm not girly enough, and he sees that too but says ""Well you're her only daughter and she's probably not getting grand kids, can you blame her!"" Honestly, I need a way out. I've even suggested we get new jobs again (we moved for his job, I do contract work (coding) from home and can do it anywhere -- but I make a living and a decent income) to get out of here because I hate living so near her, but he seems to think it just takes time. It's been 4 months and seems to be escalating. She stops by a lot when he's at work (and I'm working) and acts like I should just drop things I'm working on. She tries to make plans every weekend for just her and I and then criticizes anything I actually want to do. She clips articles on how to be more ladylike. It's really oppressive. 

How do I talk to my husband in a way he understands to get his Mom to back off? Or talk to her, but the latter seems fairly impossible, as I feel like she never listens to me. My husband listens, empathizes, but then doesn't *do* anything to support me because he doesn't want a giant rift with his parents. (My FIL is awesome and has called her out at least once in front of me, but he's usually not around when this happens.) 

Edit (suggested by someone I add these details that are in the comments now): In trying to keep this short, we have a) made sure she didn't have access to keys she somehow got, b) I have not opened the door when she came by when I was home working (husband at work), c) told her not to come by (but my husband feels bad not letting her in because she will pound on the door for like 10 minutes if you don't) unannounced and asked her to leave for hours sometimes when she doesn't. I have told her I do not like these things, she has lied to me that we were going to a science museum I suggested and then taken me to a luncheon, re-ordered drinks for me, you can read my comments for more. But we have tried to set boundaries every nice, polite way *I* can think of. Looks like maybe we have to get mean, but she has this victim narrative (all her sons think FIL is horrible to her and so is his family that never accepted her or something) that my husband buys into a little (not with me, but ""she's had a hard life,"" etc) so I was trying to avoid being too mean. I'm going to sit down my husband and talk to him about the sexism, using that word, and using ""feelings"" words because I have a tendency not to express feelings but rather logic, etc, and that might be impeding things. 

TL;DR -- MIL is going crazy because I'm her only ""daughter"" (DIL) and we moved near her, so she's trying to act out mother/daughter fantasies, but I'm a nerdy sci fi tomboy and she's driving me mad. Husband doesn't get it. "
"I [16M] bought my brother [27M] wife wedding ring for him. Am I right for being upset that he did not thank we at his wedding when he was going through the list of people who helped put the wedding together


So I have always been really good with money. I technically have been working since I was 13 years old. I walk mow the neighbours lawns, deliver news papers on my bike, clean the house and I would get payed for all of this. My mom from the day I was born had an account for me that she would put $100 in every 2 weeks. She did this for all of us. (my 3 sisters, myself and my brother). Right now I work at the mall.  

Mom and Dad are not short of money, they both really successful people. I have saved alot of my money that is almost (still have some, but it is significantly reduced from what it was, cars are expensive :() now all gone since I bought my car. Before that though my brother came to me and told me they had blown through all the money my parents gave them for the wedding. I found it hard to believe because my parents gave them more money than I would know what to do with. 

I felt bad for him because I love his wife, nice person. She would pick me up from Football when I did not have a ride. She works for a news paper and got me an interview with an actual journalist. It was for a school project on a topic we were doing. Needless to say my group loved me for it. 

So I took money out of my account for him and he bought a wedding ring. I did not see him again until the wedding. At the reception he was going through a list of everyone that made the wedding possible. I thought I would at least get thanked at the wedding. Without me what was he going to put on her finger? a candy ring?

Did not mention my name once and I was completely stunned. I felt like walking up, taking the ring back and returning it. He has not thanked me one time for the wedding ring, not even once. 

I plan on confronting him when he gets back to Beaverton. What do I say to him? or how do I handle this situation 

tl;dr: Brother asked me to buy his wife wedding ring using my savings. Has not thanked me once "
"My (30M) wife (29F) has been lying to me about something trivial for years. Not sure how to react.


Duration of relationship: 10 years together, 2 years married.

Earlier this week, my wife (""Amy"") accidentally revealed a lie she has been keeping up for years now. The lie itself is so trivial that I'm baffled about how to respond to this situation.

She came home from work and started telling me a funny story she had heard from an Uber driver earlier that day. After the story, I paused and said, ""Wait, why were you in an Uber? Weren't you at work all day?"" (She walks or takes the bus to work.) She froze and got a deer-in-headlights look on her face. She said, ""I had to run an errand, don't worry about it,"" and quickly changed the subject. I tried to change the subject back, and she said again, ""Just don't worry about it, it doesn't concern you.""

I'm not proud of what I did next but I just had such a weird, nagging feeling about it. I looked in her email (our passwords are open to each other, but I've never felt the need to look in her email before) and read the Uber receipt. I googled the dropoff address and it was a salon that does eyelash extensions. Then I checked her credit card (we have separate credit cards for ""fun money"") and confirmed that she had a purchase at that location.

I was so confused about why she wouldn't just tell me she got eyelash extensions? What's the big deal? So, I admitted my snooping, and asked her about it.

First she was furious at me for going through her stuff, so the whole conversation had a very confrontational and angry tone. I asked her why she wouldn't just tell me that she had gone to get eyelash extensions, and she said it was none of my business and she had the right to have some personal, private stuff. I said that of course she did, but I don't understand why she wanted to keep that in particular private. She also admitted that she has been doing this every 2-4 weeks for the better part of five years. So once or twice a month for five years she has been sneaking away, making sure I don't find out where she's going, and getting this done. I don't care at all about getting her eyelashes done, but the sneaking around and lying gives me a bad feeling.

The weirdest part to me is that this has been a really explicit lie. We have a 10 month old daughter and people comment all the time on how our daughter has gorgeous eyelashes, and my wife comments that it must be genetic because her own eyelashes are so long and thick.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for here, but generally I could use some perspective and advice on how to move forward. Do I write this off as a weird quirk of my wife and never bring it up again? Or do I keep snooping (on the sly) to verify she's only lying about this one, trivial issue instead of anything else? Am I overreacting by caring about this at all? I always thought of my wife as honest maybe to a fault (like if I exaggerate to make a story better, she always corrects me and tells the real version) and this is making me worry that maybe she's a different person than I thought she was.

**tl;dr:** I caught my wife in a trivial lie. I don't actually care about the thing she lied about, so I'm confused about why she lied and worried that maybe she's lying about other stuff too?

----

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback, it seems like most people think I am totally overreacting. It was helpful hearing all the different perspectives, I think what I was missing was that she might feel justifiably shy or embarrassed about her beauty routine. It honestly never occurred to me that there would be a reason someone would want to hide something like that, and to me this was like someone hiding for 5 years that they dropped off their clothes at the dry cleaners every other week. It's not a bad thing to do, so why lie!? But my eyes have been opened and I understand now that there are a lot of reasons that women feel the need to be secretive about their beauty habits. I'm going to apologize to my wife one last time and then never bring this up again."
"My mother [50'sF] used my brothers [15M] college savings for my [27F] wedding every last dollar of it.


[removed]"
"I [29F] took care of my MIL [50F] after her accident but stopped because she was horrible to me. Did I do the right thing?


Using a throwaway because I don't want this to be traced back to her somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been with my partner for about 5 years and his mother has never been very nice to me. She had a difficult upbringing which explains her selfishness so I never took it too personally. If I had to go from foster home to foster home in my childhood I probably would've developed a strong, imposing personality too.

&amp;nbsp;

A year ago she had a freak accident where she fell down the stairs and broke her back which left her paralysed from the waist down. This threw the whole family into turmoil. She was in hospital for 5 months and the drive there was more than an hour. Her husband went to see her every day after work and my partner and I drove up there as often as we could (once or twice during the week and every weekend).

&amp;nbsp;

It was a rough time for everyone. My partner was stressed and worried all the time. Especially after every visit as his mother was always very depressed (understandably!!) but on occasion she said things I thought were out of line for a mother. I'm not a mother myself so I find it difficult to relate so this is something I'm looking for advice on. She used to say to my partner ""If I don't learn to walk again I will commit suicide.""

&amp;nbsp;

Now of course I understand her situation was exceptional and I can in no way relate to the way she felt but regardless of that it really messed with my partner. He has a very stressful job too which didn't help. I never dared bringing it up to him though because I didn't know how he would react and how he felt about it.

&amp;nbsp;

There were other situations where I thought she could've just kept her mouth shut but they were by far not as bad. She got hysterical with her husband when he brought her the wrong clothes. She got angry with me for not painting her nails perfectly. She frequently got into arguments with the nurses and other hospital staff. I put all of that down to her difficult situation and I still don't blame her for it. But I'm thinking now that I should've seen it coming because of her behaviour in the hospital.

&amp;nbsp;

She was scared of being released because she didn't know how to cope at home. I then decided to talk to my boss at work and asked if I could start working weekends to take time off during the week so I could help her at home when her husband wasn't there. I work full time as a manager in a finance related department, we're always busy and understaffed and under a lot of pressure but my boss was very understanding and agreed.

&amp;nbsp;

The first few times I went to see her she had me working really hard. I cleaned the whole house from top to bottom and emptied her extremely cramped wardrobe to sort out all her clothes, throw away what she didn't want anymore and put all the other stuff back in neatly. It took 2 whole days, that's how cramped it was. After all the ""big jobs"" in the house were done I cleaned the house every time I went to see her, did the laundry and helped her with her exercises, made her tea and ran errands.  

&amp;nbsp;

This went on for half a year and I honestly could've dealt with it all if it hadn't been for her complete lack of appreciation. I never got a single thank you, not even a smile. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect her to kiss my feet and tell me how grateful she was every time she saw me. I honestly thought though that our relationship would improve. I expected her to start liking me as pathetic as it sounds.

&amp;nbsp;

To give a few examples of the way she treated me throughout the whole time: 

* My granddad was diagnosed with dementia and didn't recognise me anymore. I was very upset and when I told my MIL about it she waited until I had finished my story, looked at her watch and said ""Let's go now, we'll be late for my appointment."" (we were far off from being late)

* I could never get anything right for her. I had to make the bed twice because I didn't put the pillows down the way she wanted. Another time she asked me to clean the bathroom all over again because I didn't use the cleaning product she preferred. The other times where she didn't ask me to do something over again she mostly looked unimpressed or pointed out that it could've been done more thoroughly.

* For a birthday party we all went to a restaurant for dinner after I had spent the whole day cleaning her house. I was exhausted and we didn't eat until 10pm and didn't leave the restaurant until after midnight. She asked us to come back to their place for some drinks but my partner declined and said he was tired. She then asked me and I declined too saying I was tired too and had work the next day (she knew I worked every weekend so I could help her during the week). She then said goodbye to everyone there with a kiss and a hug except me. Pathetic me went over to her three times to say goodbye and every time she ignored me, the third time she slammed the car door shut in my face. She even hugged and kissed my partner who had declined just like I had.

&amp;nbsp;

I just couldn't take it anymore. On the way home from that birthday party I started crying and ended up telling my partner about it all. I felt exploited and pathetic for wanting her to like me. I was constantly tired from working so hard and missed not having any time to myself anymore. He was very understanding so I ended up telling my MIL I wouldn't be able to see her anymore during the week. I made up an excuse that work wouldn't allow me to take time off during the week anymore. I didn't want to talk to her about the things she did and said because she's a very confrontational person and I cannot imagine a scenario where it wouldn't have ended in an argument. I didn't want to risk causing a situation that would lead to my partner and me not being able to see his family anymore. When I told her she didn't even say anything to express regret over it.

&amp;nbsp;

You'd think I wouldn't care and get on with my life but since then I've been plagued with a guilty conscience. I picture her trying to get her household sorted and struggling and getting frustrated and sad. I feel like I should've been more understanding and patient with her and shouldn't have taken it all so personally. I also feel bad that my partner now doesn't have the peace of mind anymore knowing his mother is being looked after. On the other hand though I can't give myself up for anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit, did I do the right thing?
   
**tl;dr**: I helpd MIL after her accident and she didn't treat me nicely so I stopped and I've felt guilty ever since.

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT** 

Thank you so much for all your responses.  At one point I couldn't keep replying anymore but I have read every last one of your comments. I love this sub, you guys are great. 

It really calmed me down getting such overwhelming support. It has also been a very good lesson for me to work more on myself. Grow a backbone, learn to stand up for myself and make sure I'm happy before I try and please others. 

I already said it in one of my comments but I used to be even worse in that regard and already changed quite a bit over the last few years but you made me realise I'm not done yet and still have some work ahead of me. 

I will update you all at some point to let you know how my relationship with my MIL has developed. 

Lots of love to all of you! "
"I [28F] don't want my nephew [12M] at my wedding because he has Tourette's syndrome.


[removed]"
"Long lost sister [24F] came back and now asks for her share of inheritance. Grandparents [70s] think I'm [28M] stealing her money by not agreeing.


My dad died three years ago and left me quite a substantial estate. I worked with him all my life at the businesses and I run them now.

Six months ago a girl came to me and told me that she's my half-sister. My father was with a girl when he was married to my mother  who became pregnant and they had the baby and another couple adopted the child. That's why my mother left him. I knew about her existence but didn't know her name or anything about her until she showed up. We did DNA tests to make sure she is who she says she is and yeah she is.

I didn't feel much about the whole thing. I mean she was a stranger to me. She told me that she wants to get to know her biological family and that's the only chance she has at having a family since her adoptive family never bonded well with her. So I gave her the chance. We spent some time together, I introduced her to other people in the family and until now I thought things are well.

Last week she came to me and asked about our father's death. After a little conversation she asked me what I'd think about giving her, her fair share of the inheritance since she was her daughter. She told me that she knows that I was at our father's side when he built everything and it's unfair to ask for half of everything but maybe a quarter or a fifth is a reasonable share. I told her that her fair share is zero. I reminded her that I still stand by my original offer to help her with education or her career if that's what she needs but I'm not going to give her handouts. This is what I had originally told her right after the DNA test. She became angry, told me how's that fair that she's the one who was abandoned and I was the one who had everything in my life and even now I get everything and she gets nothing. She left. 

She is quite close to my grandparents. Losing my father was difficult for them and having her around has probably helped them move on. So I wasn't surprised when my grandfather called me and told me that I'm not being fair here. That she's my sister and I should come to some agreement with her about this. I told him what I told her about helping her education and career, he eventually told me that he's very disappointed in me. He's never said that to me before.

Honestly it hurt since I always respected my grandfather and now that he told me this I'm beginning to doubt whether I'm doing the right thing here. My father knew of my sister's existence and if he wanted to leave her anything in his will he could have. But he didn't. He left small things for other people. I don't know. I've only known her for six months and it seems unreasonable to me that I should give her a portion of the inheritance.

So I thought I consult others and see what you guys think of the whole situation.

   
**tl;dr**: long lost half-sister came to me 6 months ago and now says she wants a fair share of her inheritance. I declined but my grandparents think she's right and my grandfather told me that he's disappointed in me. What's the right thing to do here?"
"Boyfriend has a ring/resentment galore update


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ddras/27f_with_27m_of_5_years_gave_up_and_said_i/

Well, against all advice and reason, I committed to giving my relationship another go. We attended counseling. The first session was painful but productive. We worked on goals. Our counselor said that my resentment could heal if I could agree to stop questioning whether my boyfriend's efforts were sincere, and if I just took it day by day. He agreed to limit his gaming to an hour or two a night. As long as he was making genuine effort and we were communicating, our counselor said we could work it all out. Within a week, my boyfriend was back to gaming all day. We were affected by the flooding in Houston, and he was so ""stressed"" by all of it he just couldn't do a darn thing but kill people in CS to cope. I booked tickets to the opposite side of the country to see friends. He spent my last weekend in town gaming for 12+ hours/day. My last night in town he got my birthday wrong and guessed three times to get it right. When I got back almost two weeks later, he made a big show of not gaming and doting on me with exaggerated charisma. I'd be watching a TV show, and he'd stare at me till I asked why, and he'd say something like, ""I'm just mesmerized by your beauty."" He pouted when I didn't want to have sex with him and told me he was overwhelmed with sexual frustration since he wasn't gaming anymore and, ""It's like I'm seeing you and how sexy you are for the first time in years."" I started getting so anxious being badgered about fucking someone who doesn't even know my birthday that I started having to drink heavily to tolerate it.

Anyway, I went out of town again and when I got back this weekend, he made this joke. We have two friends who are twin brothers. The slob lives in the neat freak's house and pays rent. He was paying $400/month just for the room, and the neat freak asked for a mere $100 more to cover the purchase and prep of all food plus all chores, from laundry to cleaning the entire house. Pretty sweet deal, right? My boyfriend thought this was a hilarious imbalance and said, ""So Slob, Neat Freak is basically your girlfriend, right?"" Because a girlfriend is someone who stupidly does everything for someone and is too whipped to ask for much of anything in return, I guess. I didn't even feel like I snapped. It was more like something softly clunked into place. It wasn't even a fight; I'm just done.

He has since been texting mutual friends to tell them I kicked him out and he had no idea this was coming. They've known us for years and see through it, but it's still pretty shitty. I've since found out he also told at least one male friend about my breast augmentation, and I overheard him telling gaming friends how ""dope"" it was that I can't get pregnant. Good times. He seems to think that 5 years of bullshit isn't a good enough reason to break up and is now claiming I'm the love of his life and he'd never have given up on us. He's supposed to come over today to ""sort some stuff out"" with the lease I guess, but I could use some support reminding me that I've made the right choice.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend continued to game/neglect our relationship, and I finally broke up with him. He's heading over in an hour to ""sort things out."" Need some reminders that I'm not crazy/unfair/seflish.

**Edit: I had a friend come sit on my couch while my ex came over. My ex came in with really aggressive body language, saw another male was present, and visibly deflated a notch. He was still pretty angry, but he didn't take it out on me as much as I feared. He told me he never said I could have our house (rental), and that if I wanted to leave, then I needed to get out. He originally gave me this speech about how I'm family and this is all his fault, so I should stay. But now he's saying he never said that, along with a bunch of mean remarks. I know I have as much of a right to be here as him since we're both on the lease, but honestly, it's not worth the fight. Realizing that the person I've loved for five years would rather see me have to struggle to find somewhere new to live with our four pets (whom he only guilted me about but didn't even try to work out keeping any) was eye-opening in a terrible way. He said a bunch of spiteful things to me and the person I had with me, slammed the door a lot, and left. Then he started texting me again about how he loves me and I'm family and anything I need I can ask him for for the rest of my life. Except a place to live, I guess..? I could never forget how he spoke to me when he told me to get out, so that's the closure I needed, though it still hurts. I am already looking for a new home. Thanks to everyone who commented and messaged me in this post and the previous. I really appreciate the stories and words of encouragement. I'm going to cuddle my pets, drink more coffee, and listen to my bad bitch playlist while I search rental home listings.**"
"[Update]My husband (30M) is fed up with my (27F) household duties lacking, and I don't know why I can't seem to get going


My post wasn't super interesting, but I'm pleased with my progress, and with the help I received that really helped put things into perspective. [tl;dr of my previous post:I'm a terrible housekeeper with some hoarder tendencies. My spouse is fed up with it and readily admits either I change or we might be through. I have no idea how to get motivated and keep things clean](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sht0b/personal_issues_my_husband_30m_is_fed_up_with_my/)


So shout out to /u/allyouneedislovelove for suggesting I go to my GP for a wellbutrin prescription because I was able to do just that, and it made a huge difference. It also helped motivate me to even see a GP regularly and I was able to get back on to Adderall because apparently a big part of my problem was relating to adult ADD that no one would take very seriously until I made sure to impact how much it was affecting my life.

Since I posted, I have started to purge a lot things that I no longer use, and I invested in a plethora of tupperware bins so if for some reason I didnt feel ready to get rid of something, I was able to categorize it, and get it put away and out of our hair. Also, the biggest thing that helped? We moved into a bigger apartment! Turns out that was the catalyst that we really needed, having more space. My daughter has her own room now so her mess is more or less contained, we are taking advantage of basement storage, and I've become addicted to Do It On a Dime videos, and doing things as simple as organizing my closet has made a huge difference to my overall mental state. 

After my post, I spoke with my husband in depth about how things like him trashing his side of the bed felt like sabotage, and how hard it was to get going again after redoing something I had already worked so hard on once. We discussed options to improve, and the biggest thing that helped was getting him his own laundry basket, and putting a laundry basket in the bathroom as well so he had no choice but to put laundry where it goes. I also stopped insisting he hang up clothes, and just got him a larger dresser. We recognized our limitations, so I fold his laundry, since he hates that so much, he puts it away. We reorganized our daughters drawers so things all have a defined spot, and we aren't digging for things we don't need to dig for. 

tl;dr honest communication, medication, and purging what I didnt need made a huge difference overall. Thanks again /r/relationships.
