"[Update] My [66M] wife [61F] is taking care of her aunt [86F] and it is killing our marriage.


Original link: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fdl1q/my_66m_wife_61f_is_taking_care_of_her_aunt_86f/

Something completely magical happened. My wife and I were looking at a house we both actually love. It has every single thing we waned in our retirement home and it's close to everything that we need. We were thrilled and when she told her aunt and showed her the pictures of the house her aunt laughed and said ""You can't buy that, it has stairs! I can't go up and down the stairs!"" 

Something clicked in my wife's mind. She simply said to her aunt, it's the house that my husband and I like and the fact that it has some stairs that you are healthy enough to go up and down on won't stop us. Her aunt cried and cried. We called our (new) therapist which suggested that we treat her like a child, check on her every 15 minutes but not give in. We did that and she got over it by the next morning. 

My wife also got more ""tough love"" with her aunt and whenever she'll complain about stuff my wife knows are unreal my wife dismisses it politely. 

Things aren't 100% perfect, the new therapist helped my wife a lot, she mainly focused on her and why my wife was feeling the almost nurturing need to be there for her aunt. 

Thank you /r/relationships for the advice, changing therapists was a great idea, I don't know if I have had the courage to just follow through without you but I did the very next day.

"I[19F] was the only person in my family to get my dad [50M] a Christmas present


This is my throwaway account because my brother reddits and I don't want him to see this.


Hi, /r/relationships, I need some advice.
I have the best dad in the world. My dad has done nothing but support me and be there for me. He works full time as one of the top electrical engineers in his company, does the majority of the housework, and financially supports my mom, my brother, and me. (My mom also works but doesn't make much.) My dad pays fully for both my brother's and my college tuition, room, board, textbooks, cars, insurance...everything. He is always there to help and has been my go-to person since I was little. 


Here's the thing. My dad is very quiet, reserved, and introverted. He doesn't talk very much and doesn't really enjoy meeting new people or venturing out on new adventures.  He honestly just likes to stay at home or sometimes go to the gym. Because of this, he really doesn't have many ""friends""... mostly just work colleagues or a gym acquaintance. He really only has his family. But that's the problem.


My family is...a little off its rocker. My mother was emotionally abusive for the majority of my time at home (but has since gotten much better) and my brother is very haughty and arrogant. My extended family has a plethora of health problems that limit them from seeing us very much, and they also live far away. This makes Christmas and other holidays just for me, my brother, and my parents. 


My mom hates Christmas (we're still not quite sure why) and my brother seems to think he is too good to spend his money on Christmas presents. While this may seem like a very trivial problem to some, it ended up that I was the only person in my entire family that got my dad a Christmas present. 


While my dad is very good at hiding emotions, I could tell he was upset. It broke my heart to see my dad upset. My dad deserves so much more than this and I can't believe no one else can see how much he does for our family enough to even get him a Christmas present.


I guess my question is this: even though I got my dad something, I want to do more to show him how much I appreciate him. What can I do to show him how much I love him? Christmas presents just don't seem like enough.


TL;DR I was the only one in my entire family to get my dad a Christmas present. My dad was upset and now I'm upset and want to show him how much he means to me. What do?"

My lifelong friend chooses to be homeless. He works for an outdoor education program which provides housing Monday - Thursday and then he will normally go camping Friday - Sunday, he is into that.

Unfortunately he will frequently come into the city and ask one of his friends if he can crash on their couch for a night or more. My brother offers his couch frequently but I know this is causing a strain on his relationship with his fiancé and his own personal stress. 

His outdoor ed job is on break through the holiday and he has asked if he can crash at my place with the excuse being xmas and ""he thought it would be nice to catch up"". I know this is BS because he has already asked and been told no by my brother. My roommate and I have already established we didn't want anyone using our house as a crash pad prior to moving in so I know my roommate isn't ok with it. 

What is the best way to tell him he can't stay and not feel like a jackass 

TLDR: My friend wants to use my house as a crash pad because he chooses to be homeless to avoid paying rent. How do I tell him no without guilt

"Me [32 F] with my Cousin [14 F], she stole a gift and lied about it. I want to demand an apology, and have a talk with her about character.



Today at my family Christmas party, my cousin, Annie, stole one of my gifts and hid it in her suitcase. I received a purse that she really admired, and she was messing around with the straps, trying it on and looking through all the pockets. I didn’t mind, we often pass around our gifts and tinker.

Annie and her mother, Sally, were leaving to go visiting with other people, I asked Annie where the purse wound up. It was immediately clear the she had stolen it, but I gave her an easy out and she didn’t take it. She dug in her heals and lied to everyone about it. 

My whole family – my Mother, Grandmother, and one other Aunt – all made a show of searching for the purse, but no one found it. Annie and Sally had to be somewhere, and so they left and we ransacked the room that they are staying in to find it. 

I had to leave before they returned, but my other Aunt left a note where the purse was found that said “Missing Something?” They will return later tonight and she will get in trouble. 

I want an apology from her, via FaceTime, and I want to use the conversation to impress upon her the importance of being an honest and trustworthy person. 

This will create conflict that my family often avoids, but I want to attempt to change the expectation that this behavior will be swept under the rug.

 I love my cousin dearly, and I want to bee a good role model to her.  I feel like I would be failing as a family member if I didn’t use this opportunity to have a conversation about the importance of character, and how to build trust in a relationship. 

I pushed boundaries and made bad decisions as a teenager too, and I can empathize with her immensely. I need some advice on what to say to her. Frankly, I think she needs to apologize to everyone. This just isn’t how Sally deals with discipline. I will have to demand an apology from Annie in order to make it happen.

I don’t have a great relationship with Sally, but I used to. She alienated my husband, and he hasn’t come to a family gathering in 3 years because of how she acted towards him. 

She apologized to my husband by emailing me and asking me to pass it along. I refused to be a middle man, and said that she needed to at *least* email it to him, if not call him. He never responded because he was so mad about what she did, and now Sally and I have a strained relationship. 

Apologies from her a rarely actually an apology, because she says that she’s sorry for how you feel, and not what she has done. This is a whole other problem, and I hate to think that Annie will be the same way.

I’ve seen a lot of great advice in this sub about talking points, and that is what I’m after here. I’m not a parent, and I’m not around teenagers a whole lot. How do I talk to my teenage cousin about honesty and trustworthiness? What would you say to her if you were me? Is this even appropriate to do, or should I butt out?

**TL;DR:** My teenage cousin stole a gift, and lied to everyone about it. I want to demand an apology and use the conversation to talk about the importance of her character. Is this a good idea? What should I say to her?

  
**update** I called this morning to speak with aunt Sally. She immediately put Annie on the phone and she gave me an apology. 

I told her a story about how I was arrested when I was 16 for shoplifting, and how embarrassed I had been over all of it. I told her that I thought I knew how she was feeling, that I loved her very much, and that I knew she was capable of making better decisions in the future. She cried a bit and told me she loved me. I think it's a pretty good outcome, but only time will tell if the experience had the right impact on her. "

"My [24F] in laws [60sM/F] are having a hard time adjusting to new traditions and it's starting to create friction.


I want to start this off by saying that I really do love my in laws and overall have a great relationship with them, this is just one issue that's started to come up recently especially with the holidays.

For some background, my husband [24M] and I grew up with very different family dynamics (which I really do try to keep in mind when situations like this arise). My husband lived in the same house his entire life with his mom, dad and two brothers. Myself and his friends always joke that he has the most normal all-American family ever. They really do look like they could have been cut out of a Good Housekeeping magazine. 

I was an only child of divorced parents who split when I was very young. I probably moved around 10 times by the time I was 18. My relationship with both of my parents was very dysfunctional in very different ways (we've since mended the wounds and I have a good relationship with both). As a result I became a very independent, introverted child who spent much of my childhood in my room reading. 

My husband is extremely close with his parents and in some ways the closeness is foreign to me and in other ways I feel it borders on codependency. There have been a few times when I've had to confront him about ""cutting the cord"" so to speak. I really do love that he is so close to his family but sometimes it just feels excessive.

When he was 20 his girlfriend of two months at the time became pregnant. This was in no way planned and he was still living with his parents at the time. As a result, for the first year of Hannah's [3F] life she lived with my husband and his parents, so I understand this created a unique, special bond that could be why his parents are having a hard time lately.

With me coming into the picture, Hannah now has three sets of grandparents between my husband and I. By far, we see and spend much more time with my husband's parents, but I've reminded him lately that it's just as important that Hannah gets to spend time with her other grandparents as well. Both of my parents immediately embraced her with open arms and when we became engaged they both spoke excitedly about becoming grandparents, which was pretty adorable. My husband and I plan on having two more children within the next few years and I want our children to have great relationships with all of their grandparents. 

I've even started inviting his parents when we're with either my mom or dad but the reality is that it just doesn't always work out that way. For example, my parents invited myself, my husband and Hannah to go get dinner and then walk around to look at Christmas lights, which I then invited his parents to. But there are just going to be some times when we're only with my mom or only with my dad and stepmom. It now feels like my husband is keeping score. Anytime we do something with one of my parents, we then have to compensate by doing an activity with his parents, even though as I mentioned we spend MUCH more time with his parents. For example, when we went with my parents to a local tree farm to cut down a tree (an annual family tradition) my husband then had to compensate by saying we would hold off on cutting down a tree and go with his parents to pick out a pre-cut tree. Which was fine but once again felt like we were ""keeping score"".

Another example was last weekend when my husband went with his parents to visit his grandmother. Hannah and I stayed in town because she had a Christmas performance at gymnastics. I invited my mom and afterwards we went to a local event where she got to meet Santa and take a picture (my husband didn't care that I took her without him, he's not really into that whole thing). I was sending my husband photos this whole time and after Hannah met Santa he said ""My mom said she's a jealous grandma right now because she wasn't the first one to take Hannah to meet Santa"". Which seemed slightly passive aggressive and irritated me because they have had LOTS of firsts with Hannah and why are we keeping score anyways?!

Last week there was a special screening of my favorite Christmas movie at the local theater. I immediately booked tickets for my husband and I and then told my dad and stepmom they should come too because it's also my dad's favorite Christmas movie. My husband then said we shouldn't mention it to his parents because he didn't want them to be jealous or sad, which was just ridiculous to me. 

The final incident happened a couple days ago. We were discussing our Christmas plans and how we would split time between everyone. We had already agreed to spend all of Christmas Eve with his family, and then on Christmas day after Hannah's mom picked her up we would go to my dad's family's house and spend the day there. I won't even get to see my mom at all over the holidays. In the past I would wake up at 6 and go over to my dad's house on Christmas morning to open presents with my little brother and sister, which is what my husband, Hannah and I did last year, but told my husband that this year I felt it was time to start our own Christmas morning traditions with our family. He then said that after speaking with his mom about our Christmas plans she had reminded him that after my dad's last year we had gone over to their house so they were able to open presents with Hannah and she would like that to happen again this year.

I put my foot down and said that would not be happening. I reminded him that we would be spending all of Christmas Eve with his family and that I wanted us to have our own family traditions, and the reality was that as we get older and our family continues to grow, we just won't be able to make everyone happy all the time. I also reminded him that Hannah's time was being stretched thin between two sets of parents and four sets of grandparents so unfortunately it just wouldn't be realistic to see everyone for every holiday. He reluctantly agreed.

I get that this is just coming from a place of love and their desire to spend as much time as possible with Hannah and I'm really trying to accommodate them as much as possible, but I feel like it's starting to get ridiculous and I'm tired of walking on eggshells around their feelings. 

How can I address this with both my husband and my in laws without coming off like a total asshole? I love the relationship Hannah has with my in laws, it really is special, but there are more people in Hannah's life now who love her and have relationships with her and want to spend time with her. In no way am I trying to take Hannah away from them, I just feel like I'm being pulled in a hundred different directions trying to please everyone and it's exhausting.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My in laws are struggling with the fact that they aren't the only grandparents in the picture anymore, how can I nicely put my foot down and get them to understand that everyone wants quality time with Hannah and we're doing the best we can?"
"I [22 F] pulled away from my friend [21 M] of 1.5 years because he turned me down... now my friends are saying I am being a ""nice-guy"" about it and that I am being selfish. Now I'm confused.


First account--lurked for a long time, but never had a need to post before. I could use some help though--I thought I made the right call ending a friendship over unrequited feelings, but now I've had several trusted friends question my choice and my perception of things, and I'm just lost.

""Matt"" [21M] and I [22F] became friends at the start of our Junior year of college (we are half way through senior year right now). He had just transferred in, and I was volunteering with orientation for transferred. Turned out that he was also in one of my classes, and we got talking and hit if off great, and were soon good friends. We have the same major (though different sub-concentrations) and have had at least one class together for the last three semesters, and we always sat together in class, would grab coffee before/after, and usually met for drinks or for studying 3-4 times a week. Basically we saw each other almost every day. We would also go out to dinner fairly regularly (usually with a small group of friends, but one-on-one as well). 

This summer we both were staying in our college's city for internships, and as my apartment was closer to his job then his was he would crash on my couch a few nights a week, and eventually he just left a backpack of his stuff at my apartment. We also went on a few day trips to beaches nearby (usually with others, but once just the two of us).
  
Before anyone asks, no we never slept together. We both dated around, but weren't in relationships for more then a month or two with other people. For the longest time we were just really good platonic friends. 

However, I always was aware that Matt is attractive, and about 9 months ago I realized I was developing perhaps a bit more then a crush on him. But at the time he was in a fling with another girl, and then when that ended I had time to realize that if he had been interested in more he could have made a move a long time ago, so I put it out of my mind. 

While we always did joke about sex (lots of ""that's what she said"" type jokes) starting the end of this summer I felt like the sex-talk changed. We started talking about sexual experiences and fantasies, and even began making joke-comments directed at each other. He also got really weirdly jealous on two different occasions this fall--once at a start of the year party, when I was flirting with a cute guy and Matt suddenly was stuck to my side/interjecting himself into the conversation, and another time when I went on a few dates with a guy and Matt seemed overly interested in how the dates went, almost quizzing me. He also started complementing me a lot, and when we would go out partying would usually end up cuddling against my side. 

So, I figured he was starting to like me, right? The crush was still there, and as there seemed to be interest I straight up asked him out one evening. Said that I liked him as friend, but also as more then a friend, and if he was interested I'd be up for exploring the more-then-friend bit. He seemed a bit surprised, but turned me down (nicely).  This was in late September. Afterwards I went back to treating him like a friend, and started pulling back on some of the more sexual, flirty stuff. But if anything Matt seemed to ramp it up a bit. This was the period where the weird over-inquisitive-questioning about the guy I was briefly dating happened. 

Finally, after a lot of thinking about it and talking it over with my sister, I decided that I needed to back off on the friendship. I still liked him a LOT, and the flirting hadn't stopped (not just his fault--I would flirt back). It didn't seem healthy. But, due to how close our friendship was I thought I owed it to him to let him know why. So before we left for break I pulled him aside, and let him know that I still had feelings for him and because of that I would need to town down the friendship for a bit. 

Since then, though, I've had three different people tell me to my face that I am doing the same thing to him that ""nice guys"" do to girls all the time--become close friends just to hookup, and then get mad when sex doesn't happen. **I** don't feel like this is what happened. We were friends first, and I feel like he was flirting (though maybe I am wrong?). Who knows why he didn't want to date me, that is completely his choice and I get that... but isn't it also my choice to pull away from a close friendship that for me has crossed a line? I read on here all the time about friendships that are too intimate and bother a partner, and when I was talking to my sister she pointed out that another guy might have a problem with a male friend who I ate dinner with and who crashed in my apartment all the time and stuff. To be completely fair, I did tell her all about my feelings for Matt, so idk if she was really impartial.

I guess I was so confidant at first in my choice, but now I'm second guessing myself. Did I ""nice-guy"" him? I mean, two of my friends were arguing with me that I was over reading it and friendships like that are normal for students. It didn't feel normal though. Guys, do you have female friends you act like that with? I mean, I have talked about sex and sexual fantasies with my female friends, so maybe that is where they are coming from. But this just felt more intimate?

  **tl;dr**: Was really close friends with a dude for over a year. Liked him. Thought he was flirting. Asked him out and was turned down. Stayed friends for a bit, felt the flirting continued, as did my feelings. Ended the friendship... now am being told I ""nice-guy""ed him. Did I?"

Made a throwaway for this as my boyfriend uses Reddit. Apologies if this sounds disjointed or rambling.
 
To start this off, my mom has been in and out of my life since I was born. She was very immature and irresponsible when I was younger so I was mostly raised by my aunt (her older sister) and uncle. About 6 years ago she decided to buckle down and have me live with her full time for the first time, ever, really. 

Things were okay at first. But she's still very immature for a parent. She dates and sleeps around a lot. For example, I have two younger sisters and a younger brother, only one of which lives here with us. This has been a serious source of tension between us for almost the entire time I've been here.. 

Anyway, about 2 years ago I came out as gay, which my mom was fine with. She actually encouraged me to try to look for guys to bring home even when I still in high school. I've had a few boyfriends, but I didn't bring most of them around home. My most recent boyfriend, who I'll call N, has only been with me for a couple months now. But a few weeks ago I decided to ""take the plunge"" and invite him over to my place. I thought things went well, my mom was very friendly and asking N a ton of questions. But something seemed a bit off.. Like one of the first things she asked him was about his sexuality. N is bi, but prefers men, and I thought that was a very strange question for her to ask.

Since then, N has been over at my house several times. Almost every weekend and sometimes Friday nights as well. Every time, my mom will chat him up like crazy. Sometimes to the point where I have to pull him into another room to get some time with him for myself. Most of the time it seems like pretty innocent chat, but once after coming from the bathroom I caught them laughing with my mom poking N's cheek/dimple. Again, very weird behavior to me. 

Last night I came home, my mom was acting kind of weirder than normal. She was bubbly and happy and talking about how she was getting so many texts. When I asked her who they were from she listed a couple of people and then said N. I asked her when she had exchanged numbers with N and she said something like ""Oh just one of the times he was here"". 

I've texted N a few times today, but we won't see each other in person again until Monday. This is seriously bothering me though. I know N is bi, but he's always told me he prefers men and has never really dated a woman. Much less one as old as my mother. I'm very convinced that she's strongly coming onto him though, and he's either going along with it or is wanting it in return. I'm not too sure what to do now. I'm considering confronting N, but it could end up making me look like a crazy jealous control-freak of a boyfriend. Anyone have any suggestions?

So I am not sure what I want from this post except some advice and confirmation I am making the right choice.

my husband and I have had a rocky and whirlwind marriage. We married 2 months after meeting each other as I found out I was pregnant after the first month of dating. I learnt pretty early on he was a liar and kept from me that his boss didn't pay him. When I found out he was sorry to keep the lie but didn't want to worry me. So we got joint bank accounts and he promised to be honest.
a month after our child was born he decided to quit his job and start a business with his friend behind my back. He used our joint savings of $10 000 to do fund half the expenses without telling me.

when I found out I was angry but I believed in him and his business. After a year the business failed and we struggled as he couldn't admit it was failing
I later found out just this year that he had taken multiple credit card loans that totals to $20 000 in deb we cannot pay this debt off and survive. He now has a full time job but the hours are insane and he is unable to do anything except work. All other duties and responsibilities fall on me and this can be daunting when living with such an irresponsible person.  There are just some things I can't do for him and therefore they never get done.

he also has a problem with alcohol.  Whenever he starts its hard for him to stop and after 3 beers he is a very nasty drunk. He has spat on me, screamed in my face, yelled at me while I held our child which frightened them, and smashed up furniture and doors (also does this when not drunk but angry).

But the worst of all this was yesterday and today.
Yesterday he did a monster shift of around 35 hours straight
 He came home in the morning and drank 3 beers but needed cigarettes.  He asked me to get them for him and I thought I should so he doesn't drink and drive. Our young child, 2 years old, was safe in their cot watching tv and the store was 1 min drive away. So I left but my husband locked the door from the inside and left the keys in. Therefore when I got back I couldn't unlock the front door
So I went to the back door but the top bolt was locked inside so I couldn't get in. I knocked and rang his phone but no answer. I went to the back sliding door which faces into the lounge and saw my husband asleep on the couch and my child no longer in the cot!

I freaked out and after trying everything I broke the front door window to get in as I was so scared my child was in danger. I found my child in our room luckily safe. ANYTHING could have happened to them! I was pumping with relief, anger and adrenaline and woke my husband up yelling at him for my child being out the cot and me locked out and how I had to break the window to get in. My hand was bleeding
 He got up said I was lying and we were over and threw our xmas tree on the floor. He went into a rant for an hour saying I was a liar and I broke the window on purpose. 

We talked it all over later and I agreed my behaviour towards him is cruel as I always snap at him and bring up the past. He agreed his temper is shameful and he needs to try and be calm and just walk away. He said he took our child out to play and then didn't realise he fell asleep

I shouldn't of left our child with him but I thought he was safe in his cot for 10 mins while dad sat on couch. I had no idea he would take our child out of the cot.

anyway skip to today and he is meant to be helping me by getting rid of a cupboard that is all smashed up before his parents arrive and picking up a bed for his parents to sleep on and outting the bes together. 
He told me he had a work lunch near our house at a bar. It started at 4.30 but at 6pm I needed him to get home and help me and pick up the be d as his car has the room to take it home. Instead I get told he isn't going to and I should buy it and he will send a courier to get it
 By the time I grabbed some necessities from the shop there is 40 mins before the furniture store closes
He refuses to come and help me. I try to get the sofa bed in my car but it doesn't fit so he eventually drives to the store in a bad mood and over the limit, throws the sofa bed in his car and speeds off. When I get home he isn't there. He is back at the pub. 

I am really hurt because we have to leave in 3 hours to pick up his parents! He will be over the drinking limit if he drives. But he will probably just come home and fall asleep. This is going to mean I will have to go and pick them up. Its a long drive and I'm not confident driving at night. Also they will be mad at hime of they get a whiff of what has been going on and will be quite hurt to know he hasn't even made them a bed to sleep on. 

I am so angry and hurt his level of disrespect is shocking and I know I have to leave. We have a child together and he is on a marriage visa to stay here.  He is also very threatening about if I leave our child stays with him. 

I am expected to entertain and drive his parents around for 2 weeks and host a family xmas dinner at mine. I am so sad I wish I could just crawl into a hole. I feel like I have to paint on a smile so I don't ruin his parents holiday and xmas for everyone.

what should I do?

"Former friend (34F) obsessed with my (33F) pregnancy plans


Quick background: Ana and I had been friends since middle school, went to the same high school and college as well.  After two decades of a friendship filled with good times and happy memories, we had a falling out about 6 months ago.  The story leading up to it is long enough to triple the length of this post, so I'll try to sum it in a paragraph.

I've come to realize that Ana is very good at lying to manipulate people, even if those lies involve innocent third parties and may jeopardize other people's friendships with each other.  In fact if you call her out on her lies there is a high chance she will double down and turn it around on you if she can find a way to do it.  I've also noticed that she has a tendency of telling half-truths without context that will make others seem sad, pitiful, or just in a bad situation, while making a show about how worried she is for them.  She is also very concerned about her image and seems to have no qualms about ruining other people's reputations if it will lift her own.  I don't think she used to be like this so while I'm sad things played out the way it did, I feel that our friendship has run its course and am not interested in trying to work out anything.  I had actually started fading out on her as of the beginning of the year -- which she noticed and passive aggressively suggested to mutual friends *and* my face that my marriage must be making me unhappy and how I'm probably too embarrassed to talk about it --  and the fight leading to our falling out simply sped up the process for me.  Since then I've been hearing through the grapevine that she frequently brings me up when talking to mutual friends and insists that the two of us are fine.

Onto the issue.  We both got married recently, and it's been no secret that Ana wants to get pregnant within the first year of marriage.  She's brought it up many times in the past how she can't wait to get married so she and her husband can start trying for kids.  Meanwhile, I simply don't feel the same urgency.  I also think family planning is a private matter between the couple and is nobody else's business unless the couple chooses to share.  If anyone does ask, I usually say something to the effect of, ""Not yet.""  Most people accept that answer and move on, but not Ana.

I saw her once since our falling out, about four months ago at a mutual friend's house party  Within the first 10 minutes of me arriving she asked if I was pregnant (no) and if I plan to get pregnant soon (no).  Apparently the evening of that party she grilled my best friend, Rose, for information about whether I am pregnant because she didn't see me drink any alcohol (I did).  Ana seemed convinced that I am or have plans to get pregnant very soon, and am just hiding it.  This conversation repeats between them a few more times over the following weeks and Rose later tells me about it.

Other than her obsession with my not-baby, Ana also seems to really want to know what I've been up to, asking friends since she can't get the information from me directly.  Normally I wouldn't really care but before our fight I had noticed a trend where I'll say something to friend and like clockwork within 48 hours Ana would start a conversation with, ""So I heard you did X"".  Sometimes she'll just talk about it, but usually she'll subtly criticize me about it or say how she did this other thing that's so much better.  I stopped telling friends anything (which was very stressful and made me wonder about the point of having friends to begin with).  Presumably because she wasn't able to get any info from them, Ana started being obviously overly-positive in her conversations with me, while trawling my social media accounts and asking Rose about things I posted.  I'm not particularly active so I don't know if she realized that she had left a comment on a post I made over a year ago.

I know I can't micromanage what friends say to her, nor do I want to.  The most I can do -- and have done -- is to convey to them how uncomfortable I am with Ana's behavior and ask them to please not tell her anything about me.  I've had long conversations with Rose and another friend through whom most of the ""information leak"" had been happening, and I understand now that they weren't being her spies.  Rather, Ana was just playing the part of a concerned friend to get info on me.  In hindsight I also realized I had been an unwitting as well when Ana was looking for information from me on *another* friend who saw Ana for who she is way earlier and had inconspicuously faded out without causing any drama.

Rose agrees that Ana's obsession is really weird, bordering on controlling, and understands why I feel uncomfortable to the point where I don't want Ana to know anything about what I'm doing or what I'm up to if it can be helped. She has promised to not tell Ana if I do get pregnant, and reminded me to also ask other friends to also not let it slip in front of Ana.  But realistically, I can't expect my friends to uphold a 9+ month secret for me, then at the end a baby will appear and it will be obvious to Ana that everyone was withholding this information from her, even though it's not like she has some sort of divine right to this information.  I also don't want to hide it from everyone like it's a shameful thing just so nobody has to lie if Ana were to ask.  Besides, it's not like I can hide a pregnancy unless I avoid all friends after I start showing.

Ultimately I think the onus is on me to get over my paranoia and find a way to deal with it.  Advice on how to find my zen in regards to Ana?  I'm already avoiding her as much as possible by declining invitations to social events where she'll also be at just so she won't be able to corner me as easily to continue interrogating me about my uterus, or try to infer that I'm pregnant from changes in my behavior (i.e., no alcohol, no sashimi) and then go around telling people, ""I knew it!  Natcho's pregnant!"" which from her behavior, I think she would do even though it has *nothing* to do with her.  Aside from Rose and two other friends who've asked me specifically what happened between Ana and me, I haven't divulged information about our fight to others even though it is as obvious as day that we are no longer on good terms.


**tl;dr:** Had falling out with friend who has demonstrated a trend of narcissistic behavior.  She is obsessed with the occupancy status of my uterus and tries analyzing my behavior to determine whether I am pregnant.  Not pregnant yet, but may be in the near future.  Her actions makes me extremely uncomfortable and I don't want her knowing anything about me, but she is friends with most of mine, and I can't very well expect them all to lie to her face should she interrogate them about whether I am pregnant -- or can I?  Advice on how to get over myself and/or deal with this?"
