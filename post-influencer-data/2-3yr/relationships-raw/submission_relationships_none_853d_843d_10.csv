"I've [F25] returned from a month long trip and my roommate [F22] has moved all her things into my room and has been living there, with no intention of switching back.


Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do.

So I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met ""Lana"" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this).

Our flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.

Because of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say ""this would be *your* room"".

We moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.

Just over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.

I came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled ""what the fuck?"" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.

I walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said ""Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it."" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said ""And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point."" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said ""We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back"" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.

I've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as ""okay let's swap now you're home.""
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?

EDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say ""Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)"" (Yes I'm petty.)

I'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.

EDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.

**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**

**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a ""coffee"" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**

**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold ""hi"" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted ""did you do it!?"" and I said ""what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course."" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**

**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**

**She burst into tears and said ""Omg he's going to kill me"" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the ""what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah"" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like ""ring me in the next five minutes or we're over"" ""send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work"", just abusive stuff.**

**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**

**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**

**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming"" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him"" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**

**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**"

"Me [30F] with my friends [30sM/F]. They seem to think they can use my pool any time they please


So I have been friends with married couple Kelly and Liam since we were all at university together. I knew Kelly first and became friends with Liam once they started dating. We have been friends for a while, but never each other's ""best friends"".

A few years ago I moved into an apartment complex with a really great pool. I used to invite them over a lot because we used to hang out all the time. A lot of times when I would invite them, they would take it upon themselves to invite another couple as well. So I would be fifth-wheeling at my own pool basically. I let all that slide because I felt we were so close so it didn't matter. Cut to now and I only see them at best once a month for a happy hour or something. Sure, that type of thing happens, but this is what brings me to the point of the post.

About 1.5 months ago, we were at said happy hour and Liam straight up told me he was planning on using my pool basically whenever he sees fit. I didn't really know what to say so I kind of brushed it off. But, not a few weeks later I see him there with one of his friends. I kind of got a little cheesed off at that point because I am the one paying to use that pool, and since they seem to have a penchant for inviting their couple friends, I feel that I can expect the same to happen. And since we are not close like we were several years ago, I am not comfortable with them coming over on their own accord without an invitation.

Now, I do not live in a gated area, but according to management we are supposed to have pool cards on our person at the pool. Nobody abides by this, but management knows me and they seem to be friendly with many of the tenants so they pretty much know who lives there and don't really ask for ID. Basically, I would like to know how to nip this in the bud before it goes too far. I know there will be times I am going to be at the pool on my own and they will show up with their gaggle of friends (who they have excluded me from since after college...a main reason I do not want to see them so much). I know it will be an awkward situation. My two schools of thought on this are: I make it as awkward as possible for them when they do show up, or I inform management when I feel they have been taking advantage.

Once again, this is mostly preemptive, but they have done this before and now that we aren't close, I think it's disrespectful of them. Maybe I'm wrong, but I pay to live at this place and they are just using me for the awesome pool. I know it and surely they must too. 
  
TL;DR: Friends using my pool without invitation and bringing their friends as well"
"Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [29 M] of two years, he's in Vegas with his coworker [32 F] and didn't tell me she's there


My boyfriend of two years recently left for a trip to Las Vegas with his mom and two sisters. I was not invited, but as I far as I know neither were his sisters' boyfriends so I didn't think much of it. 

Yesterday his sister shared a video on Instagram, and in the video you can clearly see him in the background hanging out with his female coworker. He never mentioned anything about her being there, so I'm feeling a little uneasy. I though I'd wait a while for him to bring it up in case he just happened to bump into her down there, but he still hasn't said anything, even though he's been texting me about other less important things this whole time. 

I've met his coworker a couple times and she seems like she has a bit of a crush on him, and they text each other pretty much 24/7 which has always made me feel a little weird. I've never said anything about it because I hate to come off as the jealous type and I really don't mind if he has female friends, so he shouldn't feel like he has any reason to hide her being in Vegas with him. 

I don't think he would ever cheat on me, let alone in front of his family, so I have no idea why he's hiding this. Am I overreacting? Should I confront him?

"Me [26F] with my boss [4???M], his wife yelled at me and made me uncomfortable


 Hi everyone. I've got a fairly urgent problem and I need some advice from people who don't know the individuals involved because I don't want people taking sides or anything. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have a corporate job that's pretty grueling and has a lot of hours put in. Don't get me wrong, I love my job but we go into this knowing that we need to be reachable and in touch at all hours. Which is why we have corporate phones. Last night I was trying to call my supervisor (let's call him Ben) because he asked me to call him when a document came in so we could discuss next steps (he of course went home because perks of being the boss etc, and I stayed at work). At about 8.30 I received the info we wanted and gave him a call on the company phone. His wife answered. I introduced myself and asked to speak to him. She asked what it was about. I told her that it was a client matter, and she started asking about the client and basically interrogating me. I told her that I couldn't answer her questions, and asked again if I could speak to Ben. She hung up. 

I sent Ben an email explaining that the information had come in but that I couldn't reach him. He called me back and we discussed work. I did not tell him about my encounter with his wife. Now, I've slept on the matter and I'm wondering if I did the right thing. Should I have said something to him and to that end should I tell him? Should I involve HR? I have had no issues working with Ben but I've been thoroughly discomforted by his wife's behavior, and I'm not sure if I should be covering my own ass on this or if I even need to. I could really use some advice.

"I (25F) am getting incredibly frustrated with the sleeping situation now that I live with my boyfriend (25M)


My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been dating for a year and a half and have been living together for 6 months. Everything has been going well except for our constant fighting about sleeping. 


The issue is pretty much that I cannot sleep in the same bed as him, due to multiple reasons. 


When I first moved in I found the mattress to be incredibly uncomfortable, so I slept on the couch until I caved and bought us a new mattress and bed frame. I thought that would solve the sleeping problem, but after a few days of sleeping in the same bed as him his snoring would keep me up and I couldn't sleep. We did sleep together in the same bed at my old place when we had sleepovers before I moved in but his snoring has gotten significantly worse since then and it is now louder and unbearable. I believe it might be due to weight gain and how much he eats before bedtime, and he has a couple of drinks in the evening, but he refuses to do anything about any of those things so it is what it is. 


So due to the snoring I was getting incredibly frustrated and sleep deprived, so I set up an air mattress in our second bedroom (which is also used as our storage room) and have been sleeping on the air mattress for basically the past 6 months. 


In addition to the snoring issue, he needs the bedroom to be toasty warm and dead silent, whereas I need the room to be an icebox and I need a fan or a white noise machine going. We really weren't meant to sleep in the same room together lol.

I am sick of sleeping on an air mattress and I can feel myself getting snappy with my boyfriend all the time now because I am just so angry all of the time! I have never been like this before, I have no idea why I am getting like this. 


I have told him that I just want to sleep on a real bed for a full night but he refuses to sleep on the air mattress or the couch because they aren't as comfy as our bed and he can't get a good night's sleep. He says he absolutely needs a good night's sleep because he can't perform well at his job without it. I am getting resentful because it's like his sleep is more important than mine. I've mentioned that I want to put our new bed (which I paid for myself) in the second bedroom for me and he can sleep on the old one (we still have it, it's just sitting against a wall because he didn't want to throw it out) but he says that won't work because there is no room for a queen sized bed in the second bedroom. He's right - because the second bedroom is mostly taken up by all of his ""storage"" stuff which he won't get rid of. 


I am not sure what to do. I am so frustrated and I feel like there is no solution. We can't move to a 3 bedroom apartment because the cost of living in our city is outrageous and we can barely afford the 2 bedroom that we have now. After re-reading what I wrote I know I must sound like a salty unreasonable person, but I can't help but be mad and frustrated at not being able to sleep in a real bed. Am I being unreasonable here? Is there any solutions to this issue? Help!!

"Please help me [22/f] deal with my boyfriend's [26/m] constant whining, I am going crazy


My boyfriend and I have been together for six months. I like him a lot and we have a hobby in common that almost nobody else is into. I used to look forward to spending time with him but lately I dread seeing him because I noticed how he complains constantly! I have no idea if it's a temporary thing or if he's just been polite and complaining less till noq. Here's a few examples that happened this week:



- I saw a show come by on Netflix that I heard a lot of good things about and asked him if he'd seen it. He went on to rant about how dumb the show is for a half hour, drawing comparisons between it and other shows. During this time I ate half a tub of ice cream, brushed my teeth (he followed me into the bathroom) and did all the dishes. Then I just sat there, listened and tried to distract him with other subjects. He didn't shut up till I put in my headphones and started watching something.

- He saw me search for 'direwolf' on Wikipedia. Cue in a long rant about how we killed off the direwolf (because 'we ate it' :/???) ended in how everyone in America is stupid and we should move to Canada because it is better in Canada. I love animals and I hate to see them go extinct but these rants go nowhere. I'd rather do something or inform myself more instead.


- My neighbor has a baby that cries a lot and I don't like babies at all but that's kind of what they do, right? Nope, rant about how they live in a one bedroom with five people and that the baby is damaging his hearing and that people should stop reproducing entirely because there is overpopulation and that we should steralize everyone.


- My dad stayed at my apartment a few nights cause he had to work late. He's like the only family I have and I'm not gonna turn him away. Got treated to a whining session about how it's weird of my dad to come over and how he wants his privacy and I should start saying no. Instead of just goig to his own apartment?



I don't know what to do. I really like him but I cringe every time he opens his mouth. It's nice like 80% of the time but I can't deal with the complaining anymore! It's even made me cry before cause I wanted to have a nice day but there was this giant storm cloud coming from him! In your experience, is this temporary? I keep to myself and I don't deal with people a lot so I wouldn't know.



TL;DR; My boyfriend started complaining and whining a lot. I don't know if this is normal and what I can do about it. Is it just a relationship thing that you deal with or what?"

"I [30F] found out the real reason why my dad [51M] ""couldn't afford"" to give any gifts for my newborn daughter, and he might be cheating on my stepmom...


So my husband [30m] and I just had our first child a couple weeks ago. Our families were really happy for us. He and my mom divorced when I was a kid and I lived mostly with my mom, seeing him a few times a year for visits. We've never been that close but not on bad terms either. He married another woman (I believe she's 40-45 y.o) maybe 8 years ago. They ended up moving a few hours away so I don't see them much now except some holidays. 

He had told me apologetically before the baby was due that he probably wouldn't be able to afford much for her/us because he'd taken a pay cut at work and they were struggling with having enough to pay bills each month. At the time I thought this was weird, his job doesn't seem like the sort where that happens but I believed him and said I understood and it was fine, just come and see the baby at some point after she's here. I also offered to help him financially if he needed but he declined.

Now today something happened that made me realize he was lying. I have a friend who lives in their city and she sent me a screenshot of something on another girl's Facebook page. It was a picture of that girl with a guy and the caption ""The amazing man who's helping me upgrade my chest lol"" or something like that. My friend was asking if that was my dad and it was (but he doesn't have an FB). I asked what was going on, she said this girl she has on her FB had been posting over the past few weeks about getting a boob job and how excited she was. Turns out my father knows her and is paying for it. Oh and she's also apparently 21 and in college.

Sooo I was pretty grossed out and pissed, he's got enough money to throw on this but somehow can't afford a small thing for the baby. And looks to be cheating on my stepmom. I showed my husband and he suggested I call my stepmom and figure out if he'd lied to me about the paycut, that way I'd have more evidence. So I did and when I mentioned it she had no idea what I was talking about, his job is fine. She also said he'd told her he bought gifts for the baby and was mailing them to me in both their names. Obviously I never got anything. She didn't know why he'd lie to both of us but apologized and said she would ask him about it. 

I guess that would have been the time to tell her about the picture but I just didn't know how. I know it sounds dumb and shitty and I know she deserves to know if he's cheating. But how do you break something like that to someone. And I feel just kind of stupid like my evidence is a picture someone posted on Facebook? It could be someone he's friends with joking around or something. I mean I know there's PROBABLY something going on but… I keep second guessing myself.

So anyway we just ended the call after that and now I'm struggling with whether I should tell her and if so how... Or should I confront him first?

I'm also still just feeling upset that he doesn't seem to care about me or his granddaughter. He's only called once since she was born. It's not about getting gifts as much as him not showing any kind of interest. But apparently that's because he's more interested in buying some college chick a new rack. 

How do I handle this stupid shit?

TL;DR my dad lied and said he couldn't give anything for my new baby because of financial difficulties but he's not in any financial hardship, he's instead paying for a much younger girl's boob job. I have some evidence but I don't feel like it's a hundred percent solid and am not sure if/how I should confront him or tell my stepmom what he's doing. I'm also just mad and disgusted."

"My (34F) SO (36M) lurked Reddit to find my username and stayed up to read every post and comment I have ever made. I feel so violated. He doesn't get it.


   My SO knows that I commonly post on a sub that concerns my career. It has been so valuable to be able to get advice from others that are in the same career as I am. It has also significantly lightened the load of ""bitching"" that he hears about my job and my employers. He should be happy. Unfortunately I think he is a little upset I spend a lot of time seeking advice, but to be fair he is CONSTANTLY on his phone, or iPad- reading, watching tv, researching whatever has peaked his interest for the day. 
    He was up very late last night. I didn't think anything of it and I went to sleep. When I woke up I was grumpy that he had woken me up very early despite going to bed very late. He got mad that I pushed him away from me and blurted out that he found my ""old Reddit username"" on ""sub related to work"" and read every post and comment that I had made. Keep in mind I post almost daily, and comment on A LOT of posts. He referenced posts/comments that were made 4-5 months ago and I have hundreds of posts/comments. I feel so violated and he keeps calling me stupid. Saying I'm dumb for being upset. Isn't the premise of Reddit being able to post anonymously with judgement. He keeps mentioning things that he read and it is making me more upset as the day goes on. I could understand if he had a bad feeling that I was doing something inappropriate and searched for me but literally every post revolves around work and has NOTHING to do with him or our relationship.
  How do I explain that this is a huge violation of trust and is not okay? Also we are ""friends"" with our employers and I wouldn't put it past him to get mad at me and show them my posts which would be devastating. How do I wipe the account so he can't do that? Do I have to individually go through and delete each comment/post?

TLDR SO lurked Reddit until he found my username so he could read my posts and make fun of me. Need advice on how to explain this is NOT okay and need to know how to wipe the username.
EDIT: now I am worried he has lurked into my devices. I'm getting password notices on all of my devices except the one that he did NOT purchase. 
EDIT: you have all confirmed my feelings that I am in an abusive relationship. We live together. Have our whole lives intertwined. Idk what to do. I have asked him to find another place to live but responds by saying ""I will never leave"" despite him being unhappy. 
 

EDIT: he just urged me to change all of my passwords because someone is trying to hack me. I said I would wait until tomorrow and he said I should do it now on his iPad or extra phone (he has 3 phones) because I am at risk of being hacked NOW. Hmmmm...
EDIT: so many edits so sorry! So he just got home from a looong day of work. This morning was a super stressful morning. He had some business transactions that weren't going as planned and was already at a high level of stress when the Reddit comments were made. He walked in the door, happy as a clam. It is his birthday. He's had a nice dinner and drinks out with his business partner. I was already in bed with the lights off. He is being especially quiet and respectful and asks if I am awake. He asks what is wrong and I tell him. He laughs and says I completely misunderstood him. His ENTIRE demeanor has changed. I don't know if it was the stress from earlier but even his voice is different. I tell him I'm still upset. He asks if it's about the business transactions, I say no. About your Reddit comment and for calling me stupid for being upset. He said that is not how he meant it at all. That he got curious because I always talk about this particular sub and am always posting in it and he wanted to see what it was about. That he scrolled through and found me by the name and the way I spoke. He said he was so proud of me because normally I am very shy and don't speak up for myself but am very good at my job and it's great to see me have a support system of other people who have been in the same situations that can give and take advice. He is still pressing to change the logins for my accounts and devices. This whole situation was definitely not just a one off. It is representative that his moods are very erratic and unstable, and not fair to me. Living together is not working. We are in a very small place and I will further push to fix the living situation.
EDIT: SO I TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE and he threatened to go to my employers to ""burn me down"" get me fired, share confidential information. Refuses to leave. Says he gets mail here and I have to give him a 30 day notice. In between being hateful and mean he then breaks down and begs me to take him back. All while threatening to take my phone away because the line is in his name. I am so lost. I don't know what to do. "
"Me [21F] with creepy dude [23 M] during internship


I just started a 10-week summer internship in a city 2000 miles away from home. I am not very good at making friends but soon established a small friend group with about 10 of the other interns. 

There was this one dude who just didn't fit in, he was kinda weird and invasive and nobody really felt comfortable around him. But I didn't want to be mean so I tried to include him in conversations and be nice to him. 
The first time we ever hung out I was talking about my boyfriend a LOT so I know he knows I have a long term relationship, but he sent me a private message saying how he ""wished he had met me when I was single"" 

I ignored that message and didn't talk to him until he asked me if I wanted to go watch the sunset with him. I told him no and that he was starting to make me feel uncomfortable. 

The next day he sent me a private message asking if we could talk about it over coffee and I said no because #1 he is really starting to give me bad vibes and #2 he's not the kind of person I would ever really start a friendship with naturally. 

I thought this was the end of it but this morning I woke up to a 2 paragraph message where he accused me of ""sending him signals"" that he read as me wanting to hook up with him. As I mentioned before I am not good at making friends and maybe a little socially awkward but I am 100% sure I was not intentionally sending him ANY sort of signals (and I also talk about my boyfriend quite a bit).

I still have 9 weeks left in this internship but now I feel trapped because this dude is making me SO uncomfortable. I want to have fun and hang out with my friends but he seems so delusional that I feel like if I hang out in the same group as him he'll think I'm ""leading him on"" or something.  I really don't think I was leading him on in any way but it makes me feel dirty just knowing that he thinks that. 

What should I do? Should I just ignore him? Talk to the other interns? Talk to the intern director? I'm trying to get a full-time job offer from this internship so I don't want them to think I'm starting a lot of drama, but I also just don't feel safe around this dude anymore.

"UPDATE: My (F 30) cousin (F 23) is cheating on her husband (M 25) and I don't know what to do!


Original here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dm6e8/my_f_30_cousin_f_23_is_cheating_on_her_husband_m/

So my cousin, Jane, flew out to see her husband, Brian over the holiday weekend. Turns out: Brian had the receipts! Apparently Jane left her social media accounts opened and Brian reached out to the guy Jane slept with, Alex (lets call him that). 

Apparently Brian and Alex were very good friends. They all worked in the same area, remember? So Brian texted Alex, Alex confirmed it straight out. 

Brian said he needed space, which is perfect since Jane still had to return to my state for more training. However, Brian had some rules to help their marriage heal, primarily that  she needed to delete Alex, along with some other guys Brian found questionable (with good reason, she was flirting with others) from her life. 

Jane has returned now and is 1. Indignant about Brian's invasion of privacy. 2. Did NOT delete ALL the guys, she just named the couple she kept female names. 3. Thinks Brian is ""giving up on the marriage so easily"" (EXCUSE ME?!) 4. Is looking for revenge on Alex because he did not warn her that Brian had contacted him. She wants to make him suffer like she is. 

She also did not to Brian she slept with Alex this most recent time. You know, the one after Jane married Brian.

My niece came to me and asked me to talk to my sister, because my sister is not listening to my niece. I understand why my niece is mad at my sister.

My sister often lies to my niece to avoid telling her uncomfortable things. I know you can't always tell the whole truth to kids, but you can give them an age appropriate version, or tell them it isn't their business and to leave it alone, but I can't agree with just lying. My sister does this a lot, thinking it will make my niece happier, but it ends up being worse when my niece finds out the truth. Like my sister never told my niece that my mom was seriously sick, so my niece didn't visit my mom with the rest of the family. When my niece found out my mom was in the hospital needing surgery, my sister lied and pretended it was a minor thing and not a big deal. My mom actually almost died, and when my niece found out the truth, it hurt her more than it would have if she had been told from the beginning, especially since she might have never seen my mom again if she hadn't recovered from the surgery.

My sister also doesn't respect my niece's privacy, and will tell other people things about my niece that should be kept private. There was a big issue recently when my sister was picking up my niece from school, and started discussing something about my niece with another parent. The other parent's kid overheard and told other kids, and it really embarrassed my niece. My sister hasn't apologized for causing the problem. Whenever my niece argues with her about oversharing, my sister tells her she's overreacting and that nobody is paying enough attention to my niece's problems to care that much about them. She's kind of right, but from my niece's perspective these issues are really important, and I wouldn't think it's that hard to just respect a kid's privacy and not talk about their problems with random people.

My niece is frustrated with her mother, and asked me to talk to her, because she thinks my sister might listen to another adult. My niece has said she hates her mother and doesn't trust her. When I was her age, there were times I was annoyed by my parents or didn't like their rules, but I can't remember actually hating them, and I did trust them, so this seems like a serious problem.

I'm not sure what to say to my sister. We aren't that close because of the age difference, and I don't have kids, so I'm worried she will just dismiss me because she is older and a parent.

"My (34F) husband (36M) and I recently got back together after a six month separation. Today I found flirty texts on his phone with his coworker. I'm devastated.



For the sake of the post and anonymity, I'll call my husband Phil. I apologize for length. 

Phil and I have been married almost a decade. About eight months ago, we separated. He moved out. We have a child together, but we've always coparented very well. There were a number of reasons for our separation, some fault on both sides, but ultimately, our communication broke down. We tried therapy, and I wanted to continue counseling, but he was insistent on a separation and eventual divorce. 

Fast forward to two months ago and we started talking more. He agreed to therapy. He moved back in last month and it's going pretty well!

When we were separated, Phil became good friends with a girl at his work, I'll call her Sophie. Before our separation, I had flare ups of jealousy and I'm working on that. I know Sophie and Phil went on a few dates while we were apart, but I also know they agreed to be friends. 

Today we were at the park with our son, and I had forgotten my phone. I used his to text a friend we have plans with later today. No biggie. I saw a text from Sophie come in saying ""I feel the same way ;)"" and I got curious. 

Sophie was texting my husband that she had a dream a few nights ago that they had sex for the first time. He was telling her he was getting hot, he had a bulging in his pants, etc. She was telling him how vivid the dream was, and he was clearly loving it. 

To Sophie's credit, she did mention me. He said we were trying but it was tough. He said maybe if we didn't have a child we wouldn't still be trying (ouch). 

After seeing these messages, I gave him his phone and said ""give Sophie my best."" Phil has been apologizing ever since. I'm still furious. Am I overreacting? I know they haven't had sex. But it was so flirty and I feel sick just looking at him. 

**TL;DR: I was separated from my husband, due to communication issues and jealousy, for six months. We got back together two months ago and are working on things. Today I found texts on his phone of him flirting with his coworker.**"
"Boyfriend's [36M] cousin [31M] has been crashing our couch for six months. I'm [26f] tired but bf calls me ""difficult""


I have been living with my boyfriend for 3.5 years. In January, we moved back into my boyfriend's house that his cousin Mark* had been house-watching/sitting for about 2 years.

We moved back in. Mark bought a building lot with plans of living in an RV/temporary building there. At first, living with Mark was fine. But after 2 months, I was kind of annoyed. It's turned into me constantly nagging my boyfriend. 

Some examples of things that bother me:

- Per my boyfriend, Mark must park in the garage, as he has the most expensive vehicle.

-Mark cannot pay fair-market rent as it ""wouldn't be fair."" (After 4 months, he now pays $400 a month.)

-All Mark talks about is his building plan/lot/housing stuff when he comes into the room, upon which I promptly leave, because I'm pretty rude and I honestly don't care.

I don't have a relationship with Mark. He comes home, I hide in the bedroom. I have not spoken with him in 3 weeks. I've picked up a second job, and now I work 6-7 shifts in a week because there's no point of being home and hiding out in the bedroom. (I'm kind of weird about my own space.)

Mark is becoming more and more settled into the house, and when I ask my boyfriend if he has talked to Mark about moving out end of summer, my boyfriend remains quiet. 

My boyfriend says I'm difficult, that I need to talk to Mark, that poor Mark hasn't had his housing plans approved, yadda yadda. 

But to be honest working 6-7 shifts a week has become pretty tiring, and I don't know that I can hold out for longer than September.

"I [24f] am a nanny to two wonderful kids [10m, 9f] with divorced parents [m/f late 40s?]. How can I politely and professionally get these parents to stop calling my phone to contact their kids?


The title sounds a bit weird. Let me elaborate...the kids parents are divorced, with the kids going to their dads every other weekend, and at their moms the rest of the time. The mom and dad have an amicable relationship, but there is definitely some tension between the families. When I am with the kids at one parents house, the other parent will usually call *my* cell phone and ask to speak to the kids, at which point whichever child I hand the phone to disappears into their room anywhere from 15-45 minutes to talk to the parent calling. And then the parent wants to talk to the other child, which is another 15-45 minute conversation. This habit has really started to bug me. The mom is especially bad with this. On Fridays when the kids are at their dads she usually calls me at the worst time (i.e. when I'm in the middle of cooking dinner and need my phone for recipes) and proceeds to talk to the kids for usually 30-45 minutes (the dad usually talks for about 15-20 mins). Both households have landlines, as well as both parents having their own cellphones, and the step parents have their own cell phones (99% of the time at least one parent is home when I'm there, if not both). The kids even have their own iPad and iPod that they can use to call or Facetime! The dad usually calls 2-3 times during the week, and the mom always calls on Fridays when the kids are at their dads. 

Do you guys think I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal? Should I just let them use my phone? Is there a way to professionally and politely ask both parents to stop calling my phone to talk their kids unless its an emergency and they can't be reached in other ways? 

Thanks in advance for any advice :)

"I [23F] don't have many friends. I'm usually ok with that but get really lonely on weekends


Hi there. I've always been introverted and had few friends. Right now I have one good friend any we meet up every few weeks or so. The rest is just coworkers and some shallow aquaintances. I'm also single and my family doesn't live nearby and isn't very close emotionally either.

I always used to love 'alone time' and  usually I always found something to keep me entertained. Surfing the web, watching shows, listening to music, drawing, reading... but recently I've come to almost despise weekends and free days. Weekends are not too bad, but right now I have 4 days off and will be on my own all those days. I'll probably go running, clean my flat, read some new books, play games.. but I'm on day 1 now and already feel somewhat low and lonely. I know it's usually recommended to learn to enjoy time by yourself and get new hobbies and what not. But I still kinda feel anxious about free days at the moment bc I feel this pressure to find some way to fill them. I kinda wish I had a dog at least but sadly I can't in my flat.

It's arrived at the point where I had something like a panic attack sometimes on sunday evenings. Hasn't happened in the last 2-3 weeks now because I found a way to keep myself busy and among people all day (like visiting my friend and going to Pen&amp;Paper events). But I cannot bother my friend all the time and there's not always something happening nearby that I'm interested in. I just wanna be able to endure these 'alone days' and not feel as lonely.

"My sister[20F] asked me [25 M] to donate to her church, Boston International Christian Church. This has my hackles raised as no legitimate church I've been apart of asks members to solicit for donations or tithes from non-members.

1. I'm a non-believer and she is well aware of that.
2. I'm not a member of her church.
3. Google research has shown that this church is a sect of a larger church, the International Christian Church, that's been accused of being a cult.

"My parents [50s M/F] don't approve of me [27F] living with my boyfriend [30M]. It's causing a major divide in my family.


So to start off. I'm an only child and am incredibly tight with my parents. We've always had a dream relationship, so this is hitting me harder than it would for some people.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. In that time, we've fallen head-over-heels and agree that we'll probably get married someday. While we're not ready to be married yet, we know it will happen. Over the last few months, we floated the idea around of moving in together, and finally decided to take the plunge and do it. We're so excited to start this new adventure together.

My parents, on the other hand, are not as excited. They've always loved my boyfriend, in fact there's a running joke that sometimes they like him more than they like me. They also are firm believers that a couple should not cohabitate until they're married. For this reason, I didn't tell them we were talking about moving in with each other until the decision was final a few days ago. They were blindsided. My mom is a bit more understanding than my dad, she sees why I've made this choice and is trying to understand my rationale and beliefs as they compare to hers. However, my dad completely shut down when I broke the news to him. He is now saying that he didn't realize that he raised a daughter that has so little respect for herself, and that he will never enter my boyfriend's and my new apartment because our values don't align with his. He doesn't see why we couldn't just get married and do this first, when I've tried to explain to him that I believe that this is a relationship step before marriage. My mom is caught in the middle and I see how it's destroying her to see my dad and I at odds like this. 

I'm at a loss. I feel like my dad has completely turned his back on me overnight, and I don't know how to salvage the relationship. I understand you can't change people's opinions, but I wish he could understand mine like I understand his. Further, it's breaking my heart to see what this is doing to my family that, before this week, was amazing and close and pretty much perfect. I feel more alone than ever, and all I want is to run into my parents' arms when I'm not welcome there. What was supposed to be a happy week of new things is turning out to be the exact opposite. Is there a way to bounce back from this and help my dad see my way of thinking, or even just salvage what's left of our relationship?

"I 16f noticed my mom 36f and dad 37m live a very different life from my friends parents (40+ m/f). My dad is the only one who can take me to a birthday party (where parents stay) and unsure how to ask him to tone down the way he acts/behaves?


So my dad grew up really wealthy and has never worked a day in his life since high school. He spends most of his time laying around playing video games with my younger brother 14m and as he jokes making babies with my mother. He has a few hours of the day 1-2 where he locks himself in his office and spends time to himself. my mom always has different explanation as to why he does this ""he needs time to himself, he has work to do, he is talking to family."" When he doesn't get this time he is very agitated and is off for the whole day. My dad is also very dodgy about his parents who live only a few towns over and who we are not allowed to mention or ask to meet because my dad gets extremely agitated and angry when we do.

My mom is a helicopter mom and constantly makes sure that me and my two siblings 14m and 13f are doing our homework, keeping up with studies and socializing with friends. None of us go to private schools our dad insisted public school were fine and even bought a house in a town with a good public schoolthat we barely ever go to. Whenever I want to hang out with friends we must hang at that house and I cannot bring them to the house we actually live in because ""it's private.""
 
In the past when my friends dad's have tried talking to my dad even go out of their way to invite my dad to ""hang out"" my dad tends to make up excuses and dodge interacting with anyone. One time my close friends dad was just trying to have a conversation and my dad cut him off and told him ""this conversation isn't going anywhere and I have a lot of important stuff to do"" he proceeded to just get into the car and leave. I felt awkward the rest of the day and came up with some half lie about how much work he has (he doesn't even work!) 

I'm just really worried about an issue happening at this party most of my friends parents seem to get along really well while my parents seem to seclude themselves. My mom is much mor social and outgoing and she says my dad is as well but his attitude seems to show otherwise. 
 
Tl;dr: my dad will be taking me to a birthday party and he seems to hate interacting with people. Is there anything I can say to him to make the day easier on both of us and to try and avoid any bad interaction between him and other parents? "
