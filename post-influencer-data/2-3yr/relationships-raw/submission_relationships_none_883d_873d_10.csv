"UPDATE: I [24F] need to tell a good friend [24F] that she smells


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rmsqm/i_24f_need_to_tell_a_good_friend_24f_that_she/)

It's been a while since I asked for advice on telling my friend she had a strong body odor. It didn't get a lot of attention and it was a good result so I forgot about it. I believe I called her the night I posted and pretty much told her what I said I was going to tell her. I let her know that I really wanted her to get the job and then asked her if she knew she smelled (in a more tactful way - can't remember the exact words). She said she did know and the conversation went from there. She didn't give me the exact reason why and I didn't ask. I mentioned that since our work requires a uniform (I wear mine a few times before washing because it's an office job and I don't sweat), she should be washing hers often if she got the job. She was thankful that I brought it up with her. I followed up with talking about the job and giving her other advice about applying.


She actually did end up getting the job with me (yay!) and has become more hygienic. She's still not the cleanest but she doesn't smell like she used to and her car/room don't have the same heavy odor. To be honest, I forgot for a while that we even talked about this and almost forgot that this was even an issue before. I don't think she really remembers, either. It was a fairly easy conversation once I told her and it didn't change anything about our friendship. I wish I had told her sooner, but I'm glad I did tell her.

Kind of a boring update, but a good one. :)

"Update to previous post: Just found what is pretty much conclusive evidence that my (30m) gf (30f) is cheating on me.


Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/67rbbg/just_found_what_is_pretty_much_conclusive/

Confronted her about it when she got off work today. We talked for about 3 hours. She just left. She was cheating on me. Sexting and emotional cheating, for about 2 months. She didn't sleep with anybody. Alot of crying from her, alot of I'm sorry. A part of me wanted to still work on our relationship, she did not. The cheating happened with a friend of hers that she has known for years, and she wasn't willing to choose me over him. 

I'm not really sure how I feel about it. God help me, but I do still care about her. I am a little scared about what comes next. 

Obviously 9 years is alot of time, so it is going to take us a little while to separate our lives. 

I didn't rage or yell or any of that. Yes I am mad about it, but I just can't seem to summon up that kind of anger. No I am not throwing the rest of her stuff out or anything like that. 

Not really sure what all to put in this. Please, no comments about her being awful or anything like that. Yes this is probably the end of us for good, and I know all of that. I just want to try to move forward and get through this one day at a time. 

Tl;dr: Confronted GF about cheating. We talked, we broke up, I am alone."

"My [39/f] husband's [37/m] friend's and family have pretty much abandoned him because of his pyramid scheme


My soon to be ex-husband has really messed things up with his loved ones. 

Around 6 months ago, he got involved in selling insurance for a company that is basically a pyramid scheme. We were separated at that point so I didn't really care what he chose to do. He's a smart man and fully understands what he signed up for.

He began asking his family and friends to buy and sell his insurance. Obviously they said no.

What sort of ruffled everyone's feathers was when he asked Hannah to buy life insurance from him. Hannah is sort of everyone's daughter in the family. Let me explain. Her childhood was full of awful abuse and neglect from her parents. She still has PTSD from what happened today her.

Despite everything she has managed to get herself into an Ivy League school. She's been on medical leave for a year because of her depression and will return to school in the fall. Despite her perfect GPA, she still thought about killing herself everyday and needed to be in therapy that her school couldn't offer.

She's a lot better now and often watches my kids for me as side money. She also works full time as a barista. 

So my husband called Hannah and told her she needed to buy life insurance from him. He knows that she doesn't have parents that she can just ask for money (Her parents are in prison). Most of his friends and family have cut contact with him. In my discussions with them, it boiled down to the fact that he knows Hannah barely had money for herself and he tried to prey on her.

She doesn't know about it being a pyramid scheme because he only asked her to buy insurance. The next step was to persuade her to sell it to others by getting his manager on the phone. 

In addition, the company planned to take more money out of her account than they let on.

I'm disgusted myself because she probably would have bought the insurance thinking she was just helping him. 

My husband has been trying to get back together with me and I entertained it because I didn't want him to ever say that I didn't try. Preying on a relative-especially a young and naive one- really makes me want to wash my hands of this man. 

When is it okay to just not be with someone anymore?

"UPDATE: My [40m] daughter [18f] is planning on getting married and moving abroad with her foreign boyfriend [18m]. Wife [38f] is distraught about her decision and going crazy.


Original topic [here](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5iy2cv/my_40m_daughter_18f_is_planning_on_getting/)

This is an update from a few months ago. A lot has happened since then, the day after I posted the first topic he actually invited us to come back home with him for New year's. The plan originally was for his parents to come here for my wife and I to meet but I thought it would be a good idea for me to go and see where my daughter was going to be living firsthand. My wife, unfortunately refused to go, so she stayed. 

So we went, and while we were there stayed at his family's house. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming towards us, and even had a dinner ready for us when we arrived. There was a slight language barrier between them and I as they didn't know much English (my daughter can actually speak good Russian as she has studied the language for a few years), so a lot of translating had to be done, but we did have a meaningful interaction and I did learn a lot about them as a family. They were more than happy to answer any of my questions. 

For the remainder of the week we traveled to St. Petersburg, where we stayed to celebrate the New Year's. It honestly was one of the best times I've had in a while, especially since New Year's is such a huge deal there, and being able to spend it in that beautiful city with my daughter. 

I could see my daughter was having the time of her life the whole time we were there, she was so in love with everything and really got to exercise her Russian speaking skills. I really did get to see her and her boyfriend's relationship up close and personal also while there, and I see that they really are a close, loving couple, regardless of the age (because to be fair, my wife and did get married when we were very young). And about the marriage they were talking about, they have decided to hold it off for a few more years, until things get settled in and they at least get out of their teens. 

In February we then went to France, where her boyfriend had his 19th birthday. It was during that time that my daughter had a very serious (and somewhat emotional) talk with me, basically telling me that she knows mom and I don't really support her decisions, but this is what she really wants to do. I told her that she shouldn't feel pressured to live her life based on what my wife or I want her to do, and that as long as she's happy, I'm fine with it. And that I will always be here if she needs me. 

To wrap all this up I definitely have learned a lot about places that I was ignorant about before, or that I held very arrogant/ignorant beliefs about. Going on the trip has changed my view on the world, and even on my own country as well, and I can finally understand why my daughter is so passionate about traveling, and other countries cultures and such. We are now back in the states and my daughter and the boy are planning to leave this summer, and while I still am nervous for her, I am a lot less terrified as I was in the last post about her leaving.
As for my wife, she is still very upset and is being stubborn, but I guess it will just have to pass naturally for her, and hopefully one day she is able to calmly speak to our daughter about this (and also apologize to the boy for physically assaulting him so many times).
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We all traveled to Russia (except for wife) for New year's and I got to see and experience the culture in which my daughter will be moving to this summer. My attitude and view on this all has changed as I gained a new perspective and daughter and I have a similar mindset about her moving now. Her mother still disagrees and is angry with her, but there's nothing else that can be done about her. "
"I [27F] just found out that my teammate [24M] plagiarized parts of our group 'thesis' paper for graduation. I'm furious. What to do?


We are enrolled in a masters program, and we are about to graduate this month. The four of us have been working on a thesis-type project for the past year, and our final paper, which was completed as a group, is due tomorrow.

I volunteered to edit the final paper to make sure there weren't any grammatical errors and that it flows well between sections. I got to the first section that this person wrote, and while reading I thought, ""huh, this language sounds really technical and frankly more intellectual than what I usually hear out of his mouth."" 

I saw that he had included a footnote, so I went to the PDF cited in the footnote, and I saw the problem: he had copied sentences and phrases from the source, word for word, WITHOUT using quotation marks.

I am going through the entire 70-page paper, looking at each of his sections, and so far I've found at least 5 instances of him doing this. I also found a case where he did not include a source for a sentence he took straight out of an organization's website. It is taking me a long time to do this, and I expect I may have to pull an all-nighter to check each of his sentences in addition to all of the other copy editing I have to do.

I called and texted him, no answer. Then I remembered that he was on vacation and probably on a long haul flight right now.

Again, we are in a masters program. In corporate communications. At a good school. It blows my mind that he thought this was OK to do. If this had been caught by the professor, we could all have been failed and not been able to graduate.

What do I do? I am so pissed right now. Should I write to the professor after the paper is submitted and demand that he be penalized for this? Should I let it go since we're about to graduate anyway and won't see each other again? I'm so mad that I can't think straight right now.

"Me [22M] with my dad [54M] turned on me after I stood up for myself against one of his friends.


I own an old car, not quite a real classic but it was built in the sixties. On the last inspection I was told it'll pass this time, but I'd have to get the rust around the back window fixed.

My dad recommended a long term friend of his to me who had always worked on cars but recently set up a restoration business. I went to see him, got a quote for $5k to fix the rear windscreen rust and a little bit in two other places, and paint the repaired sections to match. I was told it'd take ""three, maybe four weeks"". I paid $2500 then and $2500 two weeks later. I know I know paying a body shop beforehand is a big mistake I'll never do again. 

That was at the beginning of May last year. Progress by July last year was cleaning the underside of the car to find almost no rust there thankfully but no more work. Then he had an urgent job in to paint a little British sports car for another guys birthday. That took up four weeks. He promised mine would begin immediately after the guys birthdate, and I dropped in to check progress a week after that. My car was up on the hoist and he'd replaced a couple of rubbers and worked on some leaks. Said he hated leaks and anyway he couldn't have it leaking all over the shop. Three weeks later I called to see if it was ready and someone else in the shop told me the guy wouldn't be back until the week after as he was on a car show road trip. I visited then, still little work done to my car. A week after that I checked in and he said the leak in the transmission needed the engine out to fix. He said since he'd taken that on himself that he'd take the engine out, fix the seal and put it right back in and wouldn't charge me. That was September last year.

That's when work stopped. I asked if he needed more cash to get work progressing. He said nope, I'd already paid and he'd treat me right. December came and no work, then January. Other jobs came in and out of the shop and I since my car went in just going by the guy's Facebook page he's painted three full cars, done the interior on one, rebuilt the engine on another, and done various mid sized repairs like mine on maybe fifteen other classics. Counting the jobs he's posted himself and the comments from his customers, he's worked on more than thirty jobs as big as mine or bigger and done them within weeks. Meanwhile mine was sitting there with no engine and closing in on expired registration.

So I stood firm, turned up and asked what I owed him to finish the car. He could tell I wasn't happy. He said nothing at all, and he had that week planned to work 100% on my car only and apologised for the the time taken. I know that's a lie as according to his Facebook page he was going away The day after for three days. I told him I couldn't work with him any more and I'd have a trailer in to take it to another body shop, and he could keep whatever I'd paid and we'd call it square. I wanted to just walk away and not have to deal with him again. 

He lost it. Suddenly he did a 180 complaining about customer unrealistic expectations and how his business was struggling and that he was really relying on my job to carry him through a tight period. This just five minutes after telling me I didn't owe him a cent more to finish the car. So I made a date, trailered the car to the other body shop (with no help from him) and within three weeks the new shop had had all the rust cut out and repaired VERY well (I was invited around to check on the work before primer) and it's already been painted. All that's left is to refit the interior trim that came out for paint, the rear windscreen, and the final paint treatment. I'm really happy with their work.

Problem is my dad is now acting worse than the previous body shop guy. He considers what I did to be a betrayal. No conversation with him is about anything else, and he's blaming me for the fact the guy is looking like he'll lose the business. I've always had a pretty good relationship with my dad so this is really weird. What on earth is happening? He doesn't dispute any of the facts over the timing or payment but it makes no sense that I could have any effect on how the business runs. To me I've donated thousands to the business and then removed the need for the guy to actually spend time working on my car so I've put him ahead of where he'd be. 

What can I do to get my dad back on my side? What's going through his head? If it weren't for him being lucid I'd wonder if he's got early onset crotchety-old-person syndrome.

TLDR; took my classic car in to body shop owned by my dad's friend for 3 weeks worth of work. Given excuse after excuse for a year with almost no work done. I cancel the job at that body shop and the owner goes off his head, my dad does the same and now thinks I'm the worst son in the world. What on earth is he thinking and how can I fix it?"

Hi Reddit. I‚Äôm using a throwaway for this as I don‚Äôt know if my husband Reddits or not and I don‚Äôt want him finding this post as I haven‚Äôt yet confronted him about this.

I‚Äôve been with my husband for 7 years. We‚Äôve been married for the past 3, and I really **thought** I‚Äôd found the one I was supposed to be with. He came off as my own personal perfect (albeit humanly flawed) man, quirks and all, and I really love him. I‚Äôve always considered that love mutual. 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened. My husband and I are very social people, and when we‚Äôre not together we‚Äôre generally out with friends (we have a mostly shared social circle as they kind of merged when we got married) or we‚Äôre hosting dinner. About 6 or 7 months ago he worked with this girl professionally and she became really good friends with my husband and I and my husband‚Äôs best friend. I completely thought nothing of her relationship with him. She‚Äôs always been so involving of me in all their interactions, and I‚Äôve never had any reason to be wary of their friendship. The other night she was invited to dinner. (This is relevant, I promise). I actually asked my husband to invite her, as I really got along with this girl and she‚Äôd become pretty entrenched in this three-way friendship dynamic with him and I. She didn‚Äôt end up coming until significantly later on, after everyone else had arrived. 

Anyway, yesterday I was having a conversation with my husband about our friends and her name was brought up. I mentioned that she‚Äôd told me about her flirtatious relationship with a guy she works with; my husband‚Äôs reaction was really telling. He got rather jealous and mumbled something about her being really good looking and being able to ‚Äòfind someone else.‚Äô I‚Äôll admit, I was confused and a little hurt that he cared so much who she interacted with, and while he showered he left his phone out. I went through it, which is actually something we used to do to one another a lot. I found a slew of messages between them that, while not sexual in nature, were not entirely innocent. He‚Äôd messaged her to say that ‚Äú[my name]‚Äù wants you to come to dinner tonight,‚Äù to which she replied, ‚ÄúAre you sure that‚Äôs a good idea?‚Äù

Amongst other things, she‚Äôd said stuff like, ‚ÄúIs us being around each other right now going to end well?‚Äù and my husband had agreed, saying he couldn‚Äôt look at her from across the table during dinner and act as though he didn‚Äôt think anything of it. 

Their conversation was just generally very odd and not overt in nature, but it made me question what I considered an innocent relationship. I want to talk to him but I‚Äôm really upset and don‚Äôt know if I can be rational about it right now. I trusted the both of them. I asked my husband to invite her over for dinner in our *home* and he went ahead and did it knowing he has these (presumably) sexual feelings for her. 

Reddit, how do I go about this? Should I just observe their interactions from here and see if I notice anything? Do I go all in and tell him what I saw?

**tl;dr:** I went through my husband‚Äôs phone because I didn‚Äôt like his reaction to something I told him concerning our mutual female friend. He‚Äôs been talking to her in a roundabout way and it seems like they‚Äôve discussed the likelihood of sleeping together."

"[24F] with my boyfriend [25m] duration over 1 year, small items have been going missing since my boyfriend moved in. He swears it isn't him and I have no reason to doubt him but the timing is so coincidental?


These items are never worth very much and I couldn't imagine why my boyfriend would lie about something so petty. The first thing I noticed was a box of q-tips. I've kept them on the second shelf of my nightstand since I was like thirteen, they're always there. One morning I noticed they weren't and asked my boyfriend where he moved them. He denied it and I literally tore apart my room looking for my q-tips before giving up and buying a new box. I wrote it off as weird and unexplainable but it's kept happening.  


Small items, of no real value, just disappear and my boyfriend swears he knows nothing about it. It's just stuff like a jar of water beads, magazine, lemon pepper, a small pair of scissors, a box of bandaids, my favorite tweezers, an oven mitt, and more rolls of tape than I can be sure of, etc. Nothing I would confront someone over using or misplacing at *all*. It's just that it keeps happening that it bothers me. He's started to seem kind of annoyed about me asking him where stuff is but sometimes it really is something he just moved. I've never accused him of lying or anything but it is really starting to make me wonder.

I have no idea *why* my boyfriend would take those things and not just tell me but this literally never happened to me before he moved in. I don't own a lot and things pretty much stay put where I decide they go, I'm not in the habit of misplacing things and there isn't a lot of space for things to hide in our place. I don't know who else it could be and I don't know what to make of this?

She and her boyfriend fight, as couples do, and she often relies on me for various small things and vents to me about him. They've been together little over a year now. That is fine, I like to think I'm a good listener and I want to be a supportive older brother. 

Problem is, they have recently got into raging fights where she ends up crying, the boyfriend apparently has slammed a few doors, and she gets into her car and speeds off. She tells me about all this and I'm obviously not pleased about it but she ends up back with him anyway. But she frequently threatens him with 'my brother is going to fuck you up' and things like that, uses me as ammo because I am a cop. As far as I can tell, there's no abuse going on where I would need to 'fuck him up' (and not that I would anyway). We have all had dinner together a few times and the poor kid was so nervous with me I thought he'd choke.

I told my sister to stop saying that to him and she got very offended like, so if something were to happen, you wouldn't back me up?? And I asked her if he had ever touched her or if the situation ever got out of hand and she says weirdly circular things like, ""no, but it could, you never know."" And we just go in circles like that.

How can I get her to change that horrible habit? I'm a cop, not a cagefighter. And the boyfriend seems like a decent kid, though they are both young and kind of temperamental. OF COURSE I have my sister's back but I don't see a need to scare him or be a threatening person towards him. Or am I being too easy on him? Is she trying to clue me in on something and I'm too dense to see it?

Tldr: sister often uses me as a shield during fights with her boyfriend, reminding him that I am a cop. I told her to stop doing that and she says that 'something could happen' so she wants to keep that shield. Is there something seriously wrong that she's not telling me and I'm too stupid to see? Or is she just being an asshole to him?"

We've been together almost 2 years. 

Weight has been something that fucked with her for her entire life. I would never ever ever bring it up on my own. Never. Even perceived or minor accidental slights in the past I have seen completely shatter her self-esteem / worth.

But recently she gained kind of a bit of weight and its noticeable and she's been asking me during sex or when I'm touching her body if I find her less attractive because of it. Truth is I do.. But I just say nahh and dismiss it. Occasionally she'll then press me for more, ""No, you like my body?""

I don't want to lie because I don't really like it. But I am really very sure that I don't want to tell the truth. Dismissing works great, but what about when it comes to actively saying I like something that I don't like? Is there any way around this?

We see each other maybe six times a month, half of the time in a group of friends or on double dates, half the time catching up over lunch or seeing movies neither of our SOs want to see.

Allison (30F): Dan's girlfriend of one year. I'm friends with her through him but we're not close. She always acts a little superior when we hang out in a group because she's older (""...but you'll see what I mean in a few years,"" ""you think you have it hard now, wait until...""). I have always thought she was insecure because she demanded access to his social media passwords not long after they started dating, but it wasn't really any of my business.

The problem: Allison will always run to me whenever she and Dan have problems. For one thing this has always made me a little uncomfortable because I didn't want to know their business, and for another she always phrased her questions as if I had dated Dan intimately in the past. 

""How did you ever put up with his mood swings?""

""Do you have any tips for how to cope with him when he's stressed from work?""

""How do you get him to make the bed? Was he cleaner in the past?""

""Did his mom like you when she first met you?""

I've told her time and time again that I met Dan when I was *five* and haven't experienced any of the things she asks about with him. I could go on about the other questions she's come to me with, none of which I can answer, but whenever I tell her to just talk to him, she stops texting me. So I've been ignoring her texts if she approaches me with a relationship problem between them (which is the only time she texts me).

Yesterday she texted me and seemed to initiate a normal conversation. When I asked her how she was doing, she said she was ""in pain :("" so of course I asked her why. She then proceeded to send a really long message about how she doesn't enjoy sex with Dan because he's not as ""skilled"" as her other exes and doesn't get her wet enough, but doesn't know how to talk to him about it without hurting his feelings, and wanted my advice/help! 

I immediately told her I did not want to know anything about that and that somebody was probably better suited to talk to her about it. My main reasons were that 1) I felt awkward, this was way too intimate of a topic for me, because she's someone I don't really know and 2) I feel like Dan would feel really embarrassed if he knew I had all this knowledge about a very private thing between them.

When I suggested she talk to someone else, Allison called me and immediately launched into this tirade where she accused me of being in love with Dan and that this had all been a test to see if I still had feelings for him. She said I would be comfortable talking about this unless it was too painful for me because I hated seeing him with another woman. I told her that was crazy and reminded her that I've been with my boyfriend for three years. She told me I was ""immature"" and that she was going to tell Dan all about this. I said ""go ahead!"", confident that he was going to see how crazy she sounded. 

She hung up and I didn't hear anything from either of them again. I didn't want to call or text Dan right away because he had an extremely important exam to study for and I thought he'd have enough on his hands with that and with Allison freaking out on him. I thought I would just wait until it all blew over the next day...

Well today I decided to message him on Facebook to wish him well for his exam, and found out that his profile had disappeared. Not just unfriended me, but either blocked me or deactivated the profile, period. I tried texting him and calling him, but it seems like he's sending me to voicemail. I left one message asking him to call me back, but so far it's been eight hours and I've gotten nothing.

Is there anything I can do? :( I don't think my friend of 20 years would just vanish into the ether on me, but I don't know what to do about this other than doing something crazy like showing up at his house. Is there anything I can do? 

**TL;DR - best friend's girlfriend told me about sex problems they were having. I told her I wasn't comfortable talking about it with her and she accused me of being in love with my friend. Now it seems he's cut me off and I'm not sure what to do...**
----

**UPDATE** 

Thanks everybody for your advice! I didn't get to read all of it at the time but it is still extremely helpful. To be clear I'm not in love with Dan, however, I am definitely very non-confrontational and a people-pleaser, which has gotten me in trouble in the past. I'm going to learn from my mistakes this time around! 

Basically, Allison was the one who blocked me on Dan's Facebook and other social media accounts. She blocked both me and my boyfriend. She may have even blocked my email, I did send one but I haven't confirmed with Dan whether or not he received it. 

The reason why Dan wasn't answering his phone, however, was because he came home straight from his test and slept for the next ~10 hours. He woke up to a few missed calls and texts from me and a TON from Allison, ranging from her breaking up with him to forbidding him from ever seeing me again. Apparently she also went to his apartment when he was asleep and banged on the door, but he was conked out. I'm kind of glad I didn't do the same thing because he was freaked out that she had done that...

Anyway, he called me back after he had talked to Allison and was like ""what the fuck is going on??"" I asked to come over with my boyfriend and talk to him about what had happened. I did that and he was quiet the whole time I was explaining it. I did show him the texts (cringe) and the received call from her where she accused me of being in love with him. He didn't say much (still groggy from waking up, I guess) and just said, ""I am SO sorry about all this.""

I told him it was okay and told him I was here to help however he needed. My bf asked him what he was going to do next, and he said he needed to think and that he'd talk to us later. We left, and a couple hours later he called me and said that he and Allison are going to couples' counseling.

That's about it. I told Dan that I feel like this relationship is unhealthy and that Allison has deep-seated issues if she's going into his stuff and blocking his friends without telling him, etc. He says he needs to give the relationship a fair shot and that she struggles with mental health issues and he's trying to be understanding of that. If she doesn't improve through counseling, he says he'll have to give it ""more thought."" 

:/

I'm not really sure what to say now... I really don't think they should stay together, but it's his prerogative. I told him I'd support him but that I didn't want to spend time with her because she made me feel so targeted and uncomfortable. He said that was okay and that no matter what, he wasn't going to stop being friends with me, and again apologized on her behalf. 

I hope he gets out of this ASAP, but I don't know what to say to him and he's a grown man, I guess. He has all the facts and that's all I can do. If anyone has other suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them. "

"I [25F] found out my Dad [50M] is behaving inappropriately (sexual) at his job


Hi, I searched for ""family advice forum"" and found here. Making the title for this gave me trouble, it doesn't really give the whole explanation of what I found. Also English is not my first language and I might make mistakes so I'm sorry. Thank you for reading.

My family (Dad, Mom, older brother and sister, me) moved to US when I was 17 after bad conditions in our home country. We all had to learn English and get jobs. I learned programming for a skill and now work in IT. I do database maintenance and some other things, for a company. My parents are not very good with computer so I help when they have any problems.

My dad (50) is small business owner now with another man. It's a shoe shop in our city. He uses his laptop for work stuff and yesterday it got viruses. I looked to fix it and I saved his data and removed virus, but I found his virus was from porn site material. He had many porn downloaded and saved, hundreds of files. This is a problem because also with the porn he has many photographs of shoes and feet. These are taken inside his shop (I have been in it and recognized the place, and they are shoes he sells there.) They include women's feet who are trying shoes in the shop. I know this isn't porn but the actual porn is also mostly feet and shoes, but sexual. Like the women are naked.  

Since I saw this I think now that maybe he has an inappropriate behavior or intention at work because he relates shoes to sex. I mean that the customers don't know he thinks this way of it or that he photographs their feet. I'm concerned about this.

My question is what should I do with what I found? I thought of 3 options and if you can give advice, it would help a lot. 1: I tell him what I found and ask about it. 2: I tell my mom and ask her to talk to him. 3: I tell his business partner.

Maybe there is more options I don't know yet so if you guys have any other ideas, please let me know. Maybe I'm ""making mountains out of mole hills"" and if this is true also tell me that? Also my family needs his income from his business, he would have to find another job if he quit. But I don't know if he would quit just because I found it. I don't know, I'm confused.

TL;DR my Dad is small business (shoe shop) owner and I found lots of feet kind of porn on his computer. I also found pictures he takes of his customers feet when they try shoes on.

Edit to include: There were also videos he took inside the store that zoom in on customer's feet from the back area of the store."

"How do I [m25] explain to my sister [f23] that what she did was not ok?


My brother and sister are still in college. They're moving to a new place and asked me to be their guarantor. I accepted, but received a phone call from the apartments and my sister had told her pothead friend (and other roomate) to put me down as a guarantor without asking me. I don't even know this person. I refused and told my mom about it and she was appropriately outraged as my wife and I were. My mom said something to her and then I received this text from my sister: ""I know you're all sketched out about being a co-signer. It was just so we didn't have to bring our  check stubs and bank statements and tip deposits that we dont have, along with credit check. The lady said it would work for both you and [friend] but we'll figure out another way. Don't trip about it.""



She clearly doesn't understand that was she did was not ok and that text really irked me. I just don't know what to say. She does shit like this all the time. 




Tl;dr: sister signed me up to be her pothead friend's guarantor without asking me. Think's I'm ""tripping."""
"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] tried to cheat on me but says it's not that bad because he turned her down!


[removed]"
"I [27M] just found out that my ex [25F] is pregnant and it's messing me up more than I would've expected.


Like my title says, I just found out that my ex is currently pregnant (probably about 5 months along) and it's honestly been a bit harder to bear than I would've expected. 

For a bit of back story, we were together for 4.25 years. She called for us to break up in New Years Day last year so it's already been almost 18 months since we broke up. Thing is it wasn't a good break-up by any means.

You can look through my history for the exact details but basically she cheated on me for the last few months of our relationship, tried to ask for a ""break,"" but when I questioned her about the aspects of the break she was distant and vague. Of course, it came out that she'd cheated and eventually through subsequent conversation I realized she probably cheated on me several times through the relationship. 

Even though I never initiated contact with her, she'd call or text me over the course of the first few months of our break. It was always seemed like her basically fishing to see if I'd take her back. She even recounted details of her new relationship and brought up alleged fights and what sounded like an abusive relationship. I kept telling her that for all intents and purposes, she and I were done but I couldn't even fathom a friendship with her if she stayed with that guy. It's one thing to cheat on me, it's a whole other to then voice concerns about your relationship to only go out the very next day with him.

Anyways, after I realized she was basically *still* not being truthful (either with me or herself) and kind of still ""playing me"" I told to not contact me unless she knew why she'd even call me. I didn't want to spend another second having pointless conversations. 

From then to today, I'd seen her twice (she showed up to mutual friends' parties) but avoided any substantive conversation and she'd texted me once (to which I didn't respond). The text was a few months ago and was basically a long apology. Truth be told, it was the most mature thing she'd said since we'd broken up and seemed sort of like the closest thing to her realizing the significant of what she'd done. It was one of the only times I could say she seemed truly sorry for having treated me poorly. 

Yesterday was her birthday and she combined her celebration with a ""gender reveal"" party. I'm still friends with some of her close friends on social media and noticed from posts that the only guy present was the guy who I'm pretty sure she cheated on me with which means he's the father. None of this surprises me based on the last few conversations we had.

As such, I would've thought news like this wouldn't have affected me at all, but it has. The guy sort of looks like me (I look like a lot of people) and I am all of sudden having feelings like he's having my kid or like I was robbed of something. It's stupid because I don't want kids right now but at the same time, had we'd not broken up, I would've been living with her and probably would've been popping the question soon. A kid probably would've been in the cards in about another year or two.

Sure, I guess I dodged a bullet or whatever. I just have these resurfacing feelings of hurt once again. I almost want to curse their relationship and not-yet -born child but that makes me feel absolutely awful. They deserve to be happy, *I guess*, but the child certainly doesn't deserve for me to curse it's existence or anything. I don't want to feel petty or vengeful. 

So, yeah, I'm just conflicted. I loved this girl so much that even if we would've broken up, I would've wanted the best for her. The way things ended made me hate her so much but I've realized that I never really stopped loving her. This news made me realize I've not really healed from it all and even after almost 18 months, I'm not exactly over her.

I don't want her back. I haven't wanted a relationship with her since I found out about the affair. Yet, I see I haven't fully let go. It's very obviously kept me from moving forward in my life. Now, I'm feeling vengeful towards an innocent child that hasn't even breathed yet? I don't want that.

Anyone got any advice?

TL;DR: GF of 4 years was cheating on me. I found out and we broke up 18 months ago. I recently found out that she's pregnant with the guy's child. Makes me feel vengeful/petty even though I don't want to feel that way. Help me move on."

"Just found out that my[23/m] girlfriend[21/f] has been muttering swear words to me in her native language every time she was annoyed with me or we fought.


My gf and I have been together for a year. Great relationship, she's smart, beautiful, funny, kind, etc. A few arguments here and there but nothing earth shattering. I am from the US and she is studying here, but she is originally from a country in Asia. A few months into our relationship, i would notice that every time she was upset with me or we were in the middle of an argument, she would randomly start muttering / shouting these phrases in her language. In the heat of the moment I wouldn't really acknowledge it but later when I asked her, she would say that sometimes when she's upset she forgets to switch to English and she's just saying things like ""what did I tell you"" or ""I hate arguing"" - pretty neutral phrases I guess one would say during an argument? 

Anyway, there are a few phrases that she always says that I remember. Today, I was talking to a semi-new coworker whose parents are from the same country as my girlfriend. He speaks the language fluently too. I was trying to show off the few phrases I knew (the ones she always says) and he started laughing because apparently I had said a bunch of filthy swear words. He thought I did that on purpose (because admittedly, most people learn the swear words first when learning phrases of a different language) but when I looked confused and asked him what I had said, he said basically the equivalent of ""You dumb piece of shit"" or ""you're such a f*cking r*tard"".. stuff like that. Nothing ""neutral"", and extremely brutal. Obviously if she had said those things in English mid-argument, I would have been upset so she decided to say them in her native language??

I am really hurt because I would never speak to her like that and I don't know how she thinks of me to think this is acceptable behavior. What do I do? Is this normal?

**tl;dr: thought my gf was always saying EXTREMELY brutal and offensive insults to me under her breath in her native language every time we fought or she was upset with me. She had always told me they were just neutral sayings in her country that she would sometimes forget to translate in English when upset. I find out she's lying. What do?**"
"My [17F] dad [37M] has been acting weird ever since I came home early and saw his new girlfriend [35F]


My mom and dad are divorced. My mom cheated on my dad with a guy from her work. Dad was shattered for a time. Due to my siblings and I liking dad more we live with him full time. He also earns the most money and can give us the most stable life. He can pay for our basic needs without an issue as well as pay for University. 

3 days ago I got out of school early due to some sort of meeting between the teachers. My school is going to undergo renovations soon, and so a lot of things are going on about that. I came home early and let myself in. I didn't think anyone was home because I did not enter through the garage. I went to the kitchen and this woman was standing there. I freaked out for a minute. My dad came running downstairs and was trying to tell me it's OK. 

He explained to me that it's his new girlfriend. He thought I was at school and brought her over for a little bit. He told me he met her at work and they've been dating for 5 months. He was not planning on telling us about her for a long while. He's been acting so weird ever since I met her.
