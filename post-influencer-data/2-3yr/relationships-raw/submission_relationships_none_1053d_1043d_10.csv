"UPDATE: Me [26 M] with my best friend [26 M] of 15 years, what the hell is wrong with him?


**Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55dbdn/me_26_m_with_my_best_friend_26_m_of_15_years_what/) thread**

So I realized that this couldn't go on and I had to do something. The comments in the thread made me realize why he was doing this, and so one time when we were driving to my house, I led the conversation to social awkwardness, which he has had some problems with. So we started talking about **his** social awkwardness in particular.

This is where I use the opportunity to say: ""Well you got this thing in social settings, though, which really shows that you are struggling in the circumstances""

He asks: ""What thing?""

And I reply: ""You joke a lot. Like with my girlfriend, she can't ask you anything, you just keep cracking constant jokes. It's almost a reflex for you. I think you may do it because you're not sure how to act""

He agreed and he said it's a problem, so we agreed to go to my house to see my girlfriend, with the goal in mind that he wouldn't joke so much.

In the start he was obviously under immense pressure, because we had just been talking about this and he must have been feeling as if I was judging his every move (and perhaps my gf too) so there was a bit of stuttering, where he must have been battling his insecurities deeply inside. But he won that battle because, you know what? He was great that evening. My girlfriend and he had a great conversation and after he left, she told me how great it was to talk to him when he acted normal.

It was really great to open the issue up, because now we can communicate about it freely and work on it.

I'd like to thank you all for your invaluable help. Without it, I would never have realized what to do!

"My [25/f] boyfriend [23/m] of 1 year has been having a threesome with his coworkers [23/m &amp; 24/f].


Thank you all for your kind and caring support. Though this all happened today, I have began making my next steps.


I did end my relationship with Jim. The conversation was difficult to have, but it needed to be had. There were questions I needed to ask for my health (such as STIs and such). Though he did say he used protection, I still scheduled an appointment with my doctor for this coming weekend.


*Edit to add this part in [I overheard Jim's phone call with Derek. He told Derek what had happened and ended his relationship with them. He also said he is quitting his work tomorrow. I do feel bad but know that is purely his decision. ]


Jim will be moving back into his parent's place tomorrow. I will be canceling my lease tomorrow morning. I did contact my best friend from back home and simply explained that I will be returning home. He offered to fly up here to help me, but I said no because I know I will break down. Right now, I need to keep strong. Seeing a friend here will only allow myself to break down into a huge mess.


I'm doing my best to stay positive. I keep telling myself, ""Better now than later. Good thing it's only been just a year and not five or more. Think of this as a life lesson. Do not hold grudges and do my best to move forward."" It's hard, I admit, but continuing to tell myself those things helps me. I would love to believe that this experience has not swayed my views on relationships; rather, I would love to believe that this experience and relationship has revealed a little more of myself. I still need to do a lot of reflecting but that can come after I have done all the physical work (moving back to my home state).


Again, everything seems to be happening so fast but it's progress. Thank you all for your kind and loving support. I hope my experience and progress can be of some hope for others. I love my boyfriend extremely and though I did not mention it in the post, I did make a lot more sacrifices for him than he has ever for me. Through all that, I don't see it as losing an investment in someone but rather I am moving on for a healthier opportunity and hopefully he will be able to learn from this as well. I have no plans on getting back together with him. His words were sweet and tempting, but they were poison.


Thank you again :)

* Original Post 


Hi reddit,


I am extremely heart broken and am in need of advice and even comfort. I don't want to use real names so I will be putting in different names. Thank you for understanding.. Let me share with you all on what happened. 


I [25/f] have been dating my boyfriend [23/m] - we will call him Jim, for a year now. It was long distance at first, but I moved to his home state in August so that we can be together physically. Everything was perfect. Jim and I were extremely happy with each other, always communicated, and we were just a happy couple. 

He works at a cafe and there he befriended one of his coworkers [23/m - we will call him Derek]. Derek has been inviting Jim to get a few drinks after work, and the two became good buds. I've met him before and he was really nice. Jim thought he was a cool guy too. Then in mid-October Derek would invite my boyfriend over to his place. They'll just hang, order pizza, and drink some beers apparently (Jim would text me that he would hang out with Derek after work then come home. I never required him to text me where he was, but Jim was always sweet to text me messages throughout the day. I did the same for him too.). Throughout the entire night, Jim would tell me how he met Derek's girlfriend [24/f we will call her Karen] and that they were very nice people. I texted him back that it was awesome and sweet how the two invited him and shared a good time with him. I thought that was just that. 


So Karen and I have never seen each other. All I knew about her was that she was Derek's girlfriend, she was nice, and also I learned that she and Derek moved in together like early October. I thought that was pretty cute. That's all I knew about her. My boyfriend started to hang out at their place more often, and I would only think of it as something as coworkers/friends just hanging out after work. I do admit that I felt left out and even asked Jim if I could hang out with them. He would say it would be a hassle since then he would have to come get me from my work or at home then go to Derek's place and also that they only hang out for a short while. I just would say ""Alright"" and be done with it. 


I had a day off work and texted my boyfriend that I will come over to his work place to have lunch together. He told me that would be awesome so I went. It was pretty busy in there, but not super busy where the workers wouldn't be able to casually talk. I noticed my boyfriend working and one other girl. Between orders, this other girl would be touching Jim's arm and would smile at him. She would act really flirty with him...and my boyfriend seemed totally fine with it. It hurt because 1) he was letting another girl flirt with him and 2) he always felt bothered if I would flirt with him in public - mind you, I'm not all handsy, but I do playfully hug his arm. 


Well Jim didn't notice me in there so I just kept to myself. Until several of the customers walked out, Jim finally noticed me. We went out for lunch, but on our way out I asked him, ""Who is your coworker?"" and he told me it was Karen. I asked him if he found her attractive, and he said word for word ""Honestly, not really. She's not ugly but she's not pretty or anything."" 


I told him how I felt about him and Karen acting that way in the cafe, and he only told me it was meaningless since that's how Karen is. I tried extremely hard to just kill my jealousy, but it really hurt me. I cried in the kitchen after Jim had gone to sleep that night. 

A few days after that event, Jim would be going to Derek's place after work and would come home really late. Earlier today he told me he would be hanging out with Derek again, and with my own insecurities boiling inside me, I asked Jim to stay home with me a few times of the week because we rarely saw each other due to our work schedules. We ended up arguing, and in my anger I snapped at him saying something like, ""Fine then you can go to your little threesome."" His face went pale and just a sick feeling made me believe that what I had said out of anger was actually true. I asked him and he admitted it.

I ultimately found out that my boyfriend has been having a threesome with Derek and his girlfriend after work almost every day since October. I asked Jim if he was bi, but Jim said they were just sharing Karen and it meant nothing - it was only sex. It hurt. A lot. Jim and I shared the same views that an open relationship never could work for us, that sex with another person while in this relationship would be viewed as cheating, and so on (he was the one who set down the ground rules, and I agreed to them - we both were very monogamous). At least I thought. 

I am completely heartbroken. Jim is in the other room just sitting at his desk, and I'm in the bedroom bawling my eyes out while seeking some sort of help from reddit. Honestly, I have no friends here. The friends I have back at home didn't want me to go and we left on bitter terms. I'm ashamed to reach out to them for help. I just can't shake off this feeling of utter disgust and betrayal. I love my boyfriend so much. So very much. A pathetic part of me wants to just work on our relationship, but that is just a horrible choice. I know I should leave him and go back home or whatever.. but right now I'm just in shock.

"My BF [26 M] got a text from his mom. It's her with a girl she met on vacation that she's trying to hook him up with. BF and I [25 F] have been together for 2 years. Help me /r/relationships, you're my only hope.


Throw away account. So my boyfriend's mom sent him a text with a picture of her hugging a young woman that she met on vacation. The message said how great this girl is, and how she likes things that my boyfriend likes. The girl apparently said she'd love to meet my boyfriend since he's so good looking. THIS GIRL LIVES 2,000 MILES AWAY. She also sent him a photo of the girls business card. 

She's trying to hook them up, when she knows we've been together for 2 years. Boyfriend just laughed the text off. 

But how do I sit at this woman's table next week for Thanksgiving, knowing that she's actively trying to break us up? She'll all love and hugs to my face. But seriously? 

Should I confront his mom and ask her why she's being so disrespectful to both my boyfriend and I?

Should I ask my boyfriend to tell his mom to knock it off? 

Or should I just file this away in my mind palace and never trust anything his mom says?


TL;DR Boyfriend's mom is trying to introduce him to other girls that live 2,000 miles away. "

"Me [30 F] with my fiancé [29 M] of 12 years, waiting for a package from the girl he cheated on me with UPDATE


So: I know this is ancient history, but we got an update, and I have several private messages asking me for an update if I something happened. So yes, we got the package. Last week. And it did not disappoint.
LINK TO ORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3siwui/me_30_f_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_29_m_of_12_years_waiting/
TL;DR: my boyfriend Oli had an affair with a friend, whom we will call Sarah. It wounded the relationship deeply, but with time, we managed to heal. He cut contact with her, and some time afterwards we moved to another place, renovated our lives, decided to finally get married, etc. One day, a common friend of Oli and Sarah, Ben, told us that he had given us our new address because she wanted to send him ""a package"". My husband freaked out. He had depression and anxiety so that was a factor. (These were the events of my first post.)

After reading the advice here, I sat down with him, we decided we did not want the fucking thing, so he wrote a message to Ben saying ""tell Sarah we do not want anything from her"", and them he blocked him. This all happened last year.

Meanwhile, life went on. He changed jobs (he is still in academy) and now he is way more happy and relaxed. My job is well paid and interesting, and I can keep some other projects on the side. We got married this summer, and our wedding was perfect for us: lively, bombastic, lots of food and alcohol, and our friends and family together. It was expensive but we did not give a damn.

This month, my husband is in a conference trip in another continent, so I am home alone. When I arrived home in the evening, there was a package adressed to him in the mailbox, with a stamp from a place where I know she lived, and a sender we don't know. I thought for a moment ""oh my, this may be her"", but then I thought that it would be pretty crazy of her to send it now.

That night, I was skyping with my husband, and made a comment about the parcel. I mentioned the name of the sender, and he did not know the name. So I proposed that I opened it with him on camera.

Aaaaand well, turns out I was right on the money. It contained several postcards, wishing him happy birthdays and merry christmasses, all unsigned. Also little notes such as ""dance in the rain"", ""look at the clouds"", ""walk barefoot"", that kind of platitudes. And it had a book, a young adult romance book. I remember saying aloud ""oh, for fucks sake"" when I saw it. Meanwhile, my husband had a face like he had seen a cockroad in his sandwich.

(The title of the novel is Stargirl. It is about a girl who arrives to a high school and she is very quirky and magical and she dances in the rain and plays the ukelele and she is Very Misunderstood by the normies. The narrator dates her, but realizes that he cannot be with her because deep down is afraid of not fitting in, so he dumps her and then regrets it forever. It is not a super bad book, I liked the prose, but, despite the intentions of the author, the heroine is too much of a Special Snowflake, and her behavior often delves into creepy territory.)

The book itself had a sad face in the dedication page and a small note saying ""read the sequel. you will understand"". It was crammed with notes in small script, and sometimes the letters had been traced several times over. All of the notes were very idealized descriptions of the heroin, about how magical and beautiful she was, about the things she did, etc. Some of the notes were also about the main character agonizing about staying with her or leaving her to ""fit in"", or descriptions about how they made out (yuck). There were also drawings of the heroine, who looked like an idealized version of Sarah.

I am not gonna lie, I laughed my ass off at this fucking Manic Pixie Dream Wannabe. My husband was less amused and more creeped out. He said that she was psycho and that he did not want that shit at home.

I kinda forgot about the book for the following days, because last week was my Week from Hell and I had to work 70 hours (I normally work thirty), because, apart from my job, I took a two-week project working in-house for a company, and I organized an art exhibition in the weekend. Also, I got pretty bad health news from a close friend (think ""incurable"" and ""degenerative""), so the topic of Sarah was out of my mind.

Yesterday I finally had time to think about it, and I got angry at that asshole (they have not met in three years! who the fuck does this dweeb think she is? Etc etc). I considered unblocking her briefly to tell her to stay the fuck away from us, but discarded the idea. Then I considered finding out her address and sending her a copy of Holes, by Louis Sachar, and 20 minimalist Pepes printed between the pages, with a note ""This is a riddle. If you solve it, I will leave my wife for you. Love, Fiancé"". Then I realized I would rather ignore her, so I threw the notes in the recycling bin and I put the book in a Freebox so somebody can take it home.

That is all. No threats, no pictures, no positive pregnancy tests. It was anticlimactic but honestly it was a welcome distraction in a heavy week. I don't like that she has our current address, but I do not think she will be sending more stuff. If she does, we will tell her to piss up a rope. The funny thing is that I don't hate her, she is an asshole but this is just too sad to hate. To mock ok, but not to hate.


TL:DR: got the package more than a year after, when Fiancé was not at home. I opened it with him on camera. It was pretty weird shit but ultimately harmless. Ignored and moved on. Thank you guys for the advice you gave in the previous post!

"I'm (25/M) about to board a plane to London to get my twin sister (25/F) out of a tough spot; seeking advice on how to handle the situation in a that is good for her.


She moved across the country (BC to Ontario) to be with a guy she had met in university. From the start, we all knew he was bad news. He degraded her publicly, so I can only imagine the sorts of things he would say and do to her in private. Being twins, she and I were always really close. But as soon as she got with this guy, our relationship began to suffer. 


When she told me she was going to move, I tried to convince her to stay. She didn't listen. I knew she wouldn't, but I had to try anyway. After she moved, she began to slowly push everyone away. Including me. We were all worried, especially when she changed her number and refused to give us the new one. We still had her on FB so we could see she was alive and (seemingly) well, but I knew in my gut she wasn't happy over there. Eventually, she blocked me and the rest of us on every social media platform. At one point our mom got really worried and considered hiring a PI just to see if she was still alive. 


For nearly three years now, we've all been worried. Our parents haven't had a decent nights rest since she left. I've tried my best to be there for everyone and put up a brave face, but I've been just as scared and just as worried. 


At around eleven o'clock this morning, I got a call from a U.K. number. It was her. My twin. In short, she was crying and she asked if I could come get her. I forgot for a second that she had called from a U.K. number, suddenly realizing she was asking me to come get her ... from the other side of the world. At first I wanted to say no because I have work and commitments here and I can't just drop everything, but the sound of her voice, crying like that and calling after so long, was a clear enough indication to me that she was in a lot of pain. Regardless of how distant she's been these past few years, I'm there for her if she needs me. So now I'm flying out to the U.K. to get her home safely. I very briefly told our parents. My mom is relieved. My dad less so. He thinks my sister got herself into this mess, so she should get herself out. I can see what he means, but if she's trapped in a toxic relationship like that, then no ... the person who's been ignoring us and pushing us away all this time wasn't her. 


Right now she's in a battered women's shelter over there, has no money and was calling from a landline at the shelter. I have the address. I spoke with a lady who works there and we've sorted out the details. My flight is boarding soon. I guess I just want to know what I should expect. What I should do in case of resistance, in case she suddenly decides she wants to go back to him, which I know can happen in cases like this. 


Oh and just to clarify, the guy is English. They met here in Vancouver, moved to Toronto soon after, and then moved to London, England at some point after she cut off communication with us. 


TL;DR - My twin sister called me from a women's shelter across the world and asked me come get her. I'm on my way. Seeking advice on what to expect and how to treat the situation in a way that's most helpful to her. "

"My mother (58F) made very cruel comments about my brother's (28M) pregnant girlfriend (22F) and I (20F) am beyond mortified.


My brother's girlfriend (I'll call her Sara here) is 6 months pregnant right now. To make things short, my mother and brother have never had a good relationship to begin with and this pregnancy has made it 100% worse. That being said, I am also not very close with my mom and have lived out of the house since I was 17 (you will see why.)

She (my mother) has a lot of family money and my brother's girlfriend comes from a very average, blue collar background. This was strike one against her (from mom's perspective.) Strike two was that she is pregnant and refuses to get married. 

Sara and my brother do not have a stable relationship right now. They have fought badly in the past, and were on the verge of a breakup when they found out she was pregnant. Sara says she wants to have the baby first, establish a better foundation for them by herself (aka work and earn money) before just shotgunning it. My brother insisted he made enough money for both of them but Sara has been really stubborn about making her own money first (I believe she has a goal, but I don't know what the amount is) and he has respected that decision. But in general, they still don't get along very well and I don't see that marriage is something that will happen any time soon.

Our mother thinks that Sara is being uppity and her pride is too strong and will ultimately affect the baby's health. Meaning, she thinks Sara should stop trying to work for no reason and just take the money my mother has offered her and rest easy before she gives birth, and get married and rely on my brother's income when the baby does come.

The other day my brother and Sara and I were having dinner together at my apartment when our mother dropped by to bring me some things. Chaos ensued. 

Long story short, my brother and mother were inside yelling at each other about this whole ""when is she going to give up her ridiculous ideas"" and marriage thing, I suggested Sara and I go outside so we stood outside on the balcony. It sounded somewhat muffled except when they moved closer to the living room and at one point, my mother called her ""That white trash charity case"" and something very nasty about ""trailer parks"" really loudly. 
I shit you not. It's been burned into my brain. 

(She did at one time live in a trailer home when she was in high school and my mother knows this.)

Sara started crying very quietly and I just froze. I didn't even know how to comfort her. I just said, ""Sara, my mother is insane. I am so sorry"" and also started crying. My brother opened the door and took her away and they went home, and my mother vented by herself for a while and was like, why are YOU crying and also left a little bit later.

I don't know what I should say to her. I feel like I have a moral obligation to apologize to her, make this right somehow, try to tell her that I'm so sorry for my mother's behavior. It doesn't reflect upon my thoughts or my brother's about her, this is not how I feel, those aren't words I ever use, and I'm just so so sorry to have her go through that. I don't want her to turn away from me, but I also feel like I don't have a say in the matter. 

Sara and I have a good relationship (in my opinion). We are closer in age than she is with my brother and I always felt like we related in a lot of ways. (She also doesn't have a good relationship with her mom, btw.) I know my brother has apologized to her and is probably comforting her already but is it okay for me to reach out 
to her? If so, how should I talk to her? Am I overstepping?


***

TLDR- Mother called my brother's pregnant girlfriend white trash- I'm mortified. How do I salvage this? Should I reach out to her? What should I say to comfort her?"

"My [24F] with my grandparents[81 M/F] told me they refuse to come to my wedding. [UPDATE]


Hey everyone, I got some great advice when I posted about my problems here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4usfhz/my_24f_grandparents_81_mf_told_me_they_refuse_to/

I just wanted to update everyone since I had a few people asking about it and I got such great advice. I decided to sit down and talk to them once more with my fiance present, and it went awful. There was screaming and crying on both sides and everyone said some awful things. We left in tears and I didn't look back and went ahead with the wedding planning.

 School started and I started a new job and I threw myself into everything I could to live with the hurt that happened. We slowly started talking again and things were looking up and they begun to slowly ask general questions about the wedding but when I showed them my dress they lost it and decided they wanted to be there to see me. 

Then, I lost my health insurance. My fiance and I sat down and decided to elope before our wedding for the insurance, and I told my grandparents that since his parents would be there that they were welcome. At first they refused, but then my grandmother said she wasn't sure she would live until the wedding and wanted to be there. My grandfather wouldn't budge and said no way in hell. I accepted where both were coming from and we went about planning an elopement in two weeks (which I would not recommend to anyone). The venue we picked out fell through and we had two days to find somewhere to get married, so we asked my grandparents if we could use their house. Their only caveat was that my father had to be present, but my stepdad was allowed there. 

The ceremony and following after-party was okay-my dad was an ass but my awesome HUSBAND (I like saying that now) told him that he was an awful person and to not start shit and he sulked like a child and watched football the entire time. My grandparents will be attending the wedding we had planned (and already paid for) in a few months and the relationship is relatively mended. 

I know a few people will probably think I am weak for still inviting them but they are so old I just want the end of their lives to be happy and filled with great memories of everyone, including my father and his new children. I'm adult enough to know that I will never have a relationship with my father once they pass away, but until them I'm okay being treated semi-poorly by my family. Thanks to everyone for the advice and solidarity that was given to me because it really helped me get through a difficult time in my life!

Wall of text incoming.  You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long.

This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is.

Back story is this.  A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years.  

A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day).  She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes.  She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly.  No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it.

We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table.  This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot.  Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip.  But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime.

We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting.  Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there.  Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good.

Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile.  Again I think things are going great.

I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this.

Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there.  Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime.

Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything.  She turns me down flat.  She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way.

Ouch.

I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again.  Hey you swing you miss, it happens.  I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life.

A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about.  But she was there for the second one.

This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"".  

Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life.  Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on.  I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this.

Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago.  Derrick as I knew he would dumped her.  It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone.

Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table.  It was very obvious that she traded off.  However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up.  I reply to her as I would any other time  and then I return to the game.

Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday.  I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"".

That was it or so I thought.  Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day.  Sometimes I don't even reply to her.  Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else.

Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me.

So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"".  At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"".

She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left.

It's over right?  Wrong.

The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing.

Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them.  She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple.  How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"".  

I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end.

I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it.  That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way.  

She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire.  

I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have.

This did not go over well so I blocked her phone.

Now WTF do I do about this sunday?  As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place.

So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location?

It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her.

tl;dr:  Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down.  No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month.  She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends.  This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

"My (21F) landlady/housemate(40s/F) let her son and his gf (25ish/M&amp;F) sleep in my room while I was away.


Hey guys! I need help on broaching a problem with my landlady/housemate.

I rent a room from a couple I have known for a couple of years. I've been living with them just over a month. Angelina is lovely, generous, kind and generally a great person to live with. She charges fair rent and the room she rented me is beautifully furnished. I cannot complain at all. Her partner Dave is great too. Dave has three kids from a previous relationship that come over at weekends sometimes. I knew this before moving in and I was cool with it cos it's only weekends and the youngest is 12 so they really don't disturb me. Plus they're nice kids. Also the house has five bedrooms so there's plenty of space for everyone. Angelina also has 4 sons from a previous relationship. One of them, Norman, lives a few hours' drive away.

Anyway, last week I went away for a week to see my boyfriend. We are in a long-distance relationship. Angelina was super nice and lent me a suitcase and offered to pick me up from the bus station when I got back (tonight). On the drive home she told me that Norman and his girlfriend had stayed in my room while I was away, and that she'd had to move some of my dirty laundry so they didn't see it. I was not asked about this in advance. I was so shocked I just didn't say anything and mortified about her touching my dirty laundry. I make sure my room is clean when anyone's going to come in it but I'd left the house at 5.30am to make my coach and then flight and since I was going to be away for a week I NATURALLY assumed nobody would go in my room, closed the door and just left it a mess. I'm now glad I didn't leave anything more intimate lying around...

I'm pretty pissed off and feel invaded. I am a university student and the reason I decided to rent from an older couple and not live with other students is that I hate the lack of privacy and the forced socialisation that comes with student accomodation. I am a very private, introverted person who needs a lot of alone time and really hates people getting all up in her business. This crossed a massive line for me and I feel super uncomfortable but Angelina just talked about it like it was no big deal.

Also, the house has FIVE FUCKING BEDROOMS which ALL have double beds. When Dave's kids are over at weekends, it's rare that all three of them come over at once. And even if they did the girls could share a room! There's absolutely no reason at all anyone should use my  bedroom and also my private bathroom which had been used, but I'm less bothrered by that.

I pay rent. Usually when people pay rent it doesn't mean that their landlords can use their rented home as a hotel for their family whenever the tenant goes away. If this was an apartment it would be totally out of line. How do I know they didn't go snooping through my stuff? I feel totally mortified and embarrassed that they saw all the mess in my room.

I need to nip this behaviour in the bud because I'm going to be away for a month at Christmastime. But I also don't want to damage the great relationship I have with Angelina and Dave. How do I broach this tactfully? Just the thought of her moving my dirty underwear around has me a horrible mix of furious and mortified. I want to set some clear boundaries so that this doesn't happen again.

"My sister [23f] thinks that marrying her bf [27m] and having kids with him will make their relationship ""spark up"" again. How do I [14f] tell her this is a bad idea?


Hello Reddit.

My sister has been dating her bf for about 3 years I think. Recently they have been dealing with some relationship issues, I don't know a lot about it but they're having some problems. Basically my sister has been telling everyone that she's going to marry him and have babies and that things are going to be fine again.

This is such a bad idea I can't even. I mean, maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe he can put some sense into her by having a serious conversation, but this is absolutely crazy. Marriage won't make their relationship better. Even if you love someone and decide to marry them, if something happens and you have to divorce, divorce is just such a pain in the ass. Now having kids is a completely different thing. You DO NOT put human beings in this planet just to get your partner to love you again. That's bullshit, careless and inconsiderate. It's fucking stupid and I think it will create a lot of resentment. They'll both have to deal with a human being for 18 years. How do I approach this situation? Her partner knows about it btw and he seems very unhappy with the situation, but I honestly think the relationship is so doomed that he doesn't even care anymore. Help.

TL;DR: my sister is crazy and wants to procreate with her bf so their relationship can ""spark up"". I don't agree with that"

"I (23/F) recently trained a woman (??/F) to replace me after I got promoted, but I'm afraid she's a liability.


I graduated college about a year and a half ago and am still very new to the workforce and navigating work relationships. I had two jobs with HORRIBLE workplace cultures before I landed at my current company, and was just promoted out of reception about a month ago.

My company hired a woman to replace me through the same temp agency I used to work with. I spent a full week sitting at the front desk with her, showing her the basics like who gets which phone calls, how to transfer those calls, going through the mail, etc. It's a pretty easy gig, but she's been making a lot of little mistakes that my coworkers and I have had to keep correcting in the month that she's been here. I try to be patient and understanding, but it's horribly frustrating to keep repeating yourself and feel like the other person isn't listening.

My biggest issue with her, though, is the fact that she also has been over-reaching and assisting clients with things that she is **not** qualified to do. At the risk of losing anonymity, I will say that I work at a health insurance company. It's a huge liability for someone to assist a patient with claims, coverage, or enrollment if they are not authorized to do so. 

I have spoken with her, two of my coworkers have spoken with her, and my supervisor has spoken with her. She will not listen and continues to help patients with things that she herself does not fully understand. We have tried to take it to HR and have her replaced, but they're hesitant to get rid of anyone (even if she is through a temp agency).

I'm at a loss, and I'm afraid I'll be blamed for anything she seriously fucks up because I was the one who trained her. How do I a) protect myself, and b) stop her from over-reaching?

TL;DR - My replacement is not qualified to do anything beyond light reception work and barely manages that, but keeps going out of her way to ""help"" clients. I'm afraid of the inevitable fallout.

"My [31F] husbands [30M] old college fling [32F] moved into our neighbourhood recently.


I really need some outside opinions and thoughts right now. I feel like I'm not crazy, but there could be a chance I am in this situation.

My husband and I have been together for 6 years in total, but we have been married for over 2 years now. We have a very happy, yet simple life that I really appreciate living with him. Both of us have our day jobs, our hobbies, our friends, and we always enjoy traveling to a new place (once or twice) every year. We have talked about children in the past, but at this point, I'm not sure if we are actually going to go through with having kids. Either way, I'm happy, so I have no expectations on that front.

At the end of September, someone new moved in a couple houses down on our block. Funny enough, it was my husbands old college ""fling/FWB"" that he was with before we started dating exclusively. I know a lot about this woman from the early days of us dating, but I couldn't believe that she actually was moving into our neighbourhood. It was pretty clear that someone was moving in at the time, so me and my husband went over to introduce ourselves, which is how we found out. 

I have always felt a little insecure knowing that she lives only a couple houses down. Why? Well, not only did they have a ""thing"" for almost two years. But, my husband said at the time that he had feelings for her and he wanted a relationship. As time went on, he got disinterested in just hooking up with her, and that is when him and I ended meeting. So, for me, it worked out well! Not so much for her, and I could definitely tell that it bothered her the few meetings I had with her.

This past weekend, our neighbours next door had us and few other people over for drinks and appetizers. Funny enough, they actually invited over ""Judy"" (fake name for the story). The evening went well, but what bothered me the most was seeing Judy pretty much hang around my husband all night. She was always laughing a what he was saying, she was rubbing his back and touching him, and she even threw out some pretty exaggerated sexual jokes and comments about my husband. This bothered me all evening.. When my husband and I got home, I talked to him about what I saw, but he thought I was making a bigger deal out of a situation that had no leeway.

For some reason, there is something I just don't trust about this situation (Judy living on our street). Saturday night was a perfect example of my suspicions. I can totally tell that Judy wants to have a second chance with my husband, even though she had her chance for almost two years of hooking up with my husband in college. The touching, the flirting, and the sexual remarks from her just bothered me. To be frank, they *still* bother me..

How can I go about this situation? I really want to tell Judy completely off.. My interactions with her have been minuscule conversations, where when my husband has ran into her, she chats him up like there is no tomorrow. Is there something fishy going on between them? It doesn't seem like my husband is up to something? I just don't trust Judy.

"I(21) got an interview for a makeup place that my friend(20) also wanted and now she upset with me. Should I not go?


Hello, I need advice. 
I'm 21 and work two jobs, both fast food and I hate it. A lot. 
I love this makeup store that I shop at and not to toot my own horn but I'm pretty great at makeup. Like I go all out everyday. 
Well, the store is hiring so me and my friend put in applications. 
My friend barely pulls $400 from her job monthly and I've offered her temporary jobs at both my jobs that would pay more but she's refused. 
I got a call back and she didn't. She's LIVID. Saying how everyone else is doing great and nobody ever calls her back and how she can't even afford rent. I brought up me offering her those jobs and she went off saying how she's tired of working food and how she wants to move up so I told her ""So do I, but I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my head above water and so should you."" Then I told her to walk in and talk to them like I did and now she's saying she can't do it until tomorrow and other excuses. 
It's pissing me off because I was so happy about this and now she's making me feel like I stole something from her just because she doesn't have a car or the motivation to do what I do. I'm debating on just telling them I'm not interested and recommending her instead. 

Update: Me and her have talked it out. She apologized for being jealous and told me it's due to her barely pulling $400 a month at her current job and that she sees me always going and doing and not worrying about bills because I work two jobs. I told her she still has so much to be hopeful for and that I'd do anything to help her out if need be because she's like a sister to me. 
I'm going to the interview Monday and ive already ironed my outfit and know EXACTLY how bomb my face is going to look. My dream is to be a cosmetologist and this is my foot in the door! 
I didn't think think this would blow up the way it did, thank you for the replies! 
Btw, I will try and get her a job there if I can, she deserves something like this to bring her up. 
 

Tldr; My friend and I put in applications for the same job, I got the call back and she didn't. Should I skip the interview?"
"How do I [26F] tell my boyfriend that I used to be a cult member and that's how I got my scars?


When I was 18 I joined a cult. It wasn't a ""let's sit in the woods and smoke weed"" cult, it was exactly what you expect from a very serious cult. I was moved to a foreign country where the cult operated, every second of every day was spent with the cult for all members, rituals that were performed most days and a lot of them were extremely abusive and almost torturous. I stayed there until I was 22 and then ran away and came back, changed my name and now live somewhere new.

I have a lot of scars and markings on my body as a result. I will get rid of them with plastic surgery but I can't afford it yet. I've been with my boyfriend (27M) for 4 months now and he's obviously noticed them on my body and asked about them, so far all I told him was that I'm not ready to talk about it and I will when I'm ready but in reality I'm just afraid of freaking him out.

"Me [42M] with my wife [36F], found out she is participating in clinical drug trials to make money for our sick son [3M]


I am still extremely shell-shocked about this all. We have been married for 10 years and she is a SAHM and I work as a chef. A year ago our son [3M] was diagnosed with a serious type of cancer and has been undergoing aggressive treatment since then.


His medication and treatment is extremely expensive. I work as a chef and regularly work 50-60 hour weeks, but that doesn't make enough to cover our living expenses and a fraction of his treatment. About 9 months ago, my wife said she had come into an inheritance of a few thousand dollars and we have been using that money towards our son's treatment. 


This morning, I was going through her planner to see what her plans were for next week, in order to plan a surprise date for us (to take her mind off the stress of our son's sickness). I noticed she had written down that she was going to a trial at X institute. I was curious and Googled it, and it turns out it's a clinical trial for Y drug. I did further research and found out my wife started the clinical trial the same time she came into her ""inheritance"". This drug is not on the market and they don't know any of the side effects, hence why they are testing it on willing participants, in exchange for a large sum of money.


I am now EXTREMELY worried that my wife is compromising her health to pay for our son's treatment costs and medications. Looking back, I have noticed that her health has deteriorated and she has been ill and lethargic. I attributed this to her chronic stress and worry about our son's health.


/r/Relationships, please help me. How do I approach this situation and discuss this with my wife? I absolutely do not want her to compromise her health for money but I am unsure how I can convey this to her since our son means the world to her.

"I [59 M] recently lost my son [26] and don't know how to deal with potential speakers at the funeral


I recently lost my son in an accident. my entire family and I are upset beyond belief and miss him dearly. We will of course hold a proper funeral service for him and I'm sure that more than a few tears will be shed.

With regards to speakers, I have found myself in a strange dilemma. He moved away in his early twenties to another city. Before he left, he was always something of a loner, with no real friends. Now, after his passing, I'm hearing from many friends of his in the city he moved to.

They all describe hm as being an incredibly open, outgoing, and incredibly sociable person. This is just not how anyone in the family has ever known him. He was a;ways incredibly quiet and meek among other people for as long as we've known him.
 
A coupe people have asked if they may say a few words during his funeral, and one person was so kind as to give a rough outline of the eulogy he intended to give. It was beautifully written, but in some ways, I can't help but feel that it's about a person I've never met. 

I don't want to disrespect the friends my son has immediately before his death, but I'm also having trouble identifying speakers for his funeral, because on top of his death, i'm only suddenly finding out about another side to his personality. 

I should mention, it's not possible that this is mistaken identity. Many of his friends have shared photos of him with me.
 
Now he funeral is approaching, and I don't know ow to handle the speakers. I love my son, and the people who have offered their condolences are wonderful, but finding out about a social life I ever knew about just breaks my heart. In a way, I don't think I can handle hearing about it right now. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My son had a much ore active social life just before he died than he did when he lived at home. Some of his friends have asked to deliver eulogies. I'm having trouble dealing with this second side of my son that I never knew about, and am worried tat the eulogies might hurt me more than I already do.

EDIT****
The reason I'm asking for help is that I fell a sort of double grief, for the quiet son I knew and the outgoing son I never knew. I want his friends to have a chance to speak. After what they've said, and as kind as they have been, I can't imagine leaving them out of the funeral."

I've been employed at the same business for almost 2 years now. The position I hold is notoriously high earning. (This is just common knowledge with the position in the industry - I have not disclosed this to anyone personally). I'm the last to leave every day and work very hard for my team. I have 8 years of experience in my field and love the job that I do.  


In the beginning these gentlemen were gentlemen. Everyone was cordial and we took part in polite office banter. Given the industry I work in I don't expect much, but basic respect isn't too much to ask. I don't believe I've created this problem as I am not much for visiting. I will chat and joke with my co-workers in passing without ever getting too personal.  


Lately, I cannot enter the perimeter without a comment about my: shoes, clothes, hair, make-up, jewelry, even the way I walk etc.  Its never-ending. Its **daily**.  I dress professionally, am clean and well-kept and have never welcomed this behaviour. For example, *""I liked your pants better yesterday. Those ones are no good."" ""Where did you even get that (insert item of clothing here)?"" ""Run. Run. Run. Clip-clop!"" ""Wow that lipstick is something else.""* Its constant.  


Now I understand when working with men, you have to have a sense of humour - I can take a joke. Its gone from comments here and there, to daily narration of almost everything I do. I have to walk by a couple of their desks on the way to my office and they will mimic my steps by stomping their feet every time I pass. **Every time**.


I've stood up for myself in the past and asked them why they would say/do these things to me and there's been apologies but it boomerangs after a couple days of peace. Lately I will keep walking and pretend I didn't hear. I don't know if these men have issues with a younger female in a higher earning position than they are or if they are intimidated but I want it to stop.  


I know I'll be told to speak to HR, but  I want to handle this myself if at all possible.  I would not like to cause a scene at my job and consider myself to be a no maintenance employee.

"My [30m] wife [26f] of 2 years is inconsolable because the new lingerie she bought didn't fit.. could really use a woman's perspective on this one.


We've been together for 6 years, married for 2 of those. She's been really upset (like, locking herself in the bathroom to cry, refusing to talk to me, then coming out with red eyes pretending she's fine) since yesterday and I'm really at a loss here. I don't know what I can do or say to help her.

Basically, she went out and spent money on herself for the first time in months on some nice new lingerie. She bought the same size she always does without trying anything on, then got home and realized that it's all too small. I don't understand it and neither does she - I'm honestly convinced that the store changed their sizing sometime in the past year, because everything else she owns from that store in the same size fits perfectly. She hasn't gained weight, and she's a small person to begin with (only ~120lbs).

Since then, she's been practically inconsolable. She feels guilty for wasting ""my"" money (her job doesn't pay well) because the items she bought were expensive and can't be returned. She really hates her body and doesn't feel like she's normal, even though I personally think she's the sexiest woman alive. She's been struggling with symptoms that point toward MS (no diagnosis yet, we're still waiting for an MRI but all of the doctors have been preparing her for this diagnosis) and doesn't feel in control of her own body right now which I'm sure isn't helping matters. She was really excited to try the new stuff on but wouldn't even let me see her in it. Now she's been crying off and on all day, but she refuses to talk to me about it. She feels embarrassed and every time I try to talk to her I feel like I'm just making it worse.

I feel responsible for this because I've been encouraging her to be more active and work out with me. She's been very inactive for the last year and I'm concerned about her health. She virtually never exercises at all and spends ~8hrs a day sitting in front of a computer for work. It's not that she's gained weight or anything. I just know she'd feel healthier if she were more active.

I'm really at a loss here. I feel like she's having a meltdown over something relatively minor (she could just go buy the same stuff in the next size up if she wanted, we can afford it no problem.. and I personally think it's a problem with the store's sizing, not with her) and I just don't know how to help. It's obviously not just about the clothes, but I feel like it set off a chain reaction and she's really spiraling now. How can I be supportive and help her feel better?

  **TL;DR - Wife has been crying since yesterday when she bought lingerie that didn't fit, but refuses to talk to me about it. I don't understand it because it feels so minor to me, but it's really affecting her. Can someone help me see things from her perspective so I can help her?**"

"Me [25F] with my best friend [29F] and her boyfriend [27M]: She thinks she's getting engaged, but I doubt it. I'm supposed to help her boyfriend plan a proposal. Should I reach out to him?


So I've been best friends with Callie for 7 years, and she's been with Mike for almost 5 years. She desperately wants them to get married, but I don't think it's anywhere on his radar. Due to some comedy of errors circumstances she thinks they're going to get engaged. This happened once before and it was a nightmare... should I reach out to her boyfriend to let him know what's up? 

So they've been dating for almost 5 years. She's wanted to get married since very early on in their relationship, but he's always told her that he would consider it after he finished his PhD (which I think he has 3+ years left on, I'm not sure). They live together and she moved to be with him, and had to take a minimum wage job that she does NOT enjoy. But I've never said anything because the most important thing for her is to be with him, and who am I to judge, yknow? 

So last Christmas she came home to her parents house, and through snooping, Callie found what she assumed to be an engagement ring. She was super excited about it and figured Mike was going to propose. Wrong. The ring ended up being part of like a holiday display her mom was making (which makes me question whether or not it actually looked like an engagement ring at all). She was DEVASTATED and it lead to her and Mike having one long extended fight about getting married for MONTHS. 

Fast-forward to this year. Callie's grandmother has recently passed away, and at the wake, her aunt Lucille got drunk and told Callie that the family ""had considered offering Mike one of Grandma's old rings to use as an engagement ring."" Callie interpreted this as that they are getting engaged (again) and wouldn't you know it it's almost the holiday season and she's just on cloud nine. 

The thing is, I feel like I would know if an engagement was actually going to happen. There has always been a deal that if Mike was going to propose, he would come to me for ideas, I think because Callie doesn't trust him to be romantic enough himself. Which is a whole other can of worms. I haven't heard a peep from him. Maybe he's just going to do it himself, but he's always seemed relieved about the fact that I'm here to help him with a proposal. That and the fact that Aunt Lucille only told her they had CONSIDERED offering him a ring makes me think that there is no proposal on the horizon. 

I know what a shitstorm it was last year when Callie was expecting a Christmas Day proposal and it didn't happen. It was a big step back for them in their relationship, and it was just months of simmering tension. I feel like I should warn Mike that Callie has it in her head again that they're going to get engaged this year. Maybe he'll pleasantly surprise me and tell me it's true, maybe I can help them avoid all the nastiness if he nips it in the bud and sits her down and tells her no proposal this year. 

But of course, as this sub always says, don't be a butt-in-ski about other peoples' affairs. And I don't particularly want to get in the middle of their relationship. I just also don't want to see them, BOTH my friends, in another fight about the state of their relationship. 

So, what do?

  **tl;dr**: My friend thinks a proposal is imminent. She also thought that last year, but it turned out that no and they had a huge fight. Should I tell her boyfriend she's expecting a proposal again this year? "
"*Update* Me [26 M]with my wife [25 F] of 1.5 years together 3.5, she cheated about a year into our relationship and just confessed.


Link to the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56z72o/me_26_mwith_my_wife_25_f_of_15_years_together_35/)

Sorry for any errors formatting on a phone sucks. So my original post wasn't too terribly popular but I like updates so here we go. 

My wife was open and willing to do the paternity test on our son since the cheating was within a few months of us conceiving. I am ecstatic to say that he is within 99.9% certainty mine! That was a massive hurdle for the health of our damaged marriage. 

We have since been going to MC every other week and working on our trust issues... well my trust issue. There wasn't much I could do as far as digging since it happened over two years ago I have all of our texts saved on my phone and I couldn't even scroll all the way back to that time without my phone glitching out.

She has maintained complete transparency through our our marriage and has continued to do so after her confession. She seems remorseful to me she is willing to talk and listen when I'm struggling. It seems that she is by and far more upset at herself than I am at her. 

I'm sure you can tell by the tone that we are headed down the path of rebuilding our marriage. I'm sorry that this story doesn't have the justice that this sub loves but I believe we can have a happy family moving forward and there is zero tolerance for shady behavior moving forward. We have had many discussions about this. 

Thank you to all who PM me and those who had constructive responses to my situation! 

**EDIT: I understand that it's frustrating and honestly hard to grasp why a person would not just up and leave a cheater. I have many times in my life had no problems leaving a cheater. It's sad to me that because I believe my wife is behaving in a way that makes me confident she won't cheat again, that it creates an indictment on my self esteem. It's alright to not understand it why I'm doing what I am but don't try and tear me down further in hopes of convincing me to leave.

  **tl;dr**: Paternity test was positive I am the father. With the help of MC and transparency we are going to stay together and work on our marriage. "
