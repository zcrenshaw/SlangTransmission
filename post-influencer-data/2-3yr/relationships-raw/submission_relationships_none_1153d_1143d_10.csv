"My [56 M] daughter [18 F] has a new 29 year old boyfriend and won't listen to me when I tell her it's not a good idea.


Original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vjpo1/my_56_m_daughter_18_f_has_a_new_29_year_old/?utm_source=mweb_redirect&amp;compact=true

This is an update post! Hello everyone! I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice.

Anyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier.
I told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the ""he has work"" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad.

So anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said ""Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad"". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it &amp; that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do.

A few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if ""things got bad"". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her ""you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!"" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said ""if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!"" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said ""I have never seen you so angry!""

I never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :)

Tldr; they broke up!

Edit: HOLY SHIT this blew up!! I'm at work so I can't read or answer much of the replies but I'll get to everyone tonight hopefully! &amp; for all those who are wondering- yes it was pinch not punch. No typo there! Thanks everyone for the support its amazing to hear! :)"

My original post didn't get much attention, but a lot has happened since I made that last post so I figured I'd update. I took the advice of reaching out to her again and I invited her to the movies again (I go there a lot lol). We met up at the theater and we talked about our previous date.

Me: ""So... sorry about not talking to you for a few days.""

Her: ""It's cool.""

Me: ""Yeah... I was just kind of caught off guard by the kiss. Not that I disliked it, uh, I was just kind of surprised and I wasn't expecting it because I've never been kissed before. I mean, uh, I've been kissed by like my grandma and stuff-""

At this point in my awkward ramble, she starts laughing. ""You are so funny.""

We stood there in silence for a second. I decided to break the silence.

""You know, it wasn't a *bad* kiss. I was just kinda caught off guard. I mean, I don't really have the authority to judge kisses, considering I've only had the one-""

And she cut me off and kissed me. Except this time, it was reciprocated. We stopped kissing and she looked at me and said, ""Two.""

So yeah, I guess I have a girlfriend now.

Edit: for people picturing me as Michael Cera, imagine him crossed with Tobey Maguire from the first 20 minutes of Spider-Man.

Thank you all for the dozens of helpful comments and messages. Here's the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4v35ti/my_best_friend_25f_has_been_ignoring_me_for_a/



I called Sarah's home phone the morning after I got her message. Her mom answered and told me she was out with Joe. We chatted for a few minutes, and.then she suddenly started crying. She told me she feels like she's lost her daughter. She said she would ask Sarah to call me. I didn't get a call back. 


The next day I got a surprise visit from Lily, who Sarah and I were really good friends with in college. Lily and I had fallen out of touch and I was really excited to see her again. That night I took her to a party. An actor that Sarah always liked was there, and Lily ended up hitting it off with him and posting a picture of the three of us doing shots on Facebook. 


That night I got a text from Sarah saying, ""Since when do you hang out with (actor)?"" I was extremely annoyed and didn't respond. An hour later she texted ""I guess you're too much of a celebrity to respond.""


I spent about an hour ranting to poor Lily, and then composed an email to Sarah. I think I kept it pretty unemotional. Basically, I told her that she had really hurt me by cutting me out of her life, and I didn't think it was fair for her to suddenly reappear with no explanation or apology. I also said that I think her relationship with Joe is toxic and that I hope she overcomes her fear of being alone so that she can stop jumping into unhealthy relationships. Finally I told her that both her mother and I are worried about her, but I don't have the time or emotional energy to keep trying anymore. If she wants to get in touch when she's fixed her personal issues, I'll be open to listening. Until then, we're not friends anymore. 



I'm upset, I'm tired, but mostly I'm done. I hope I made the right decision.

"My fiance [27f] is a ""people pleaser"". It's causing problems and I'm [30m] thinking about calling off the wedding.


I've been with my fiance for 3 years, 8 months engaged. We've had our ups and downs, but for the most part things have been pretty great, until she moved in 6 months ago. We've been combining our lifestyles and finances, basically easing into merging our lives together.

The problem is she's a ""people pleaser"", in her own words. She's been in therapy for 6 years, and I guess I never knew how bad it was until moving in with her, a lot of which she's hidden from me. I don't want this to get too long, so here's some of the highlights in no particular order:

* She recently was promoted into accounts payable at her company and realized she is the lowest paid person on payroll. She didn't negotiate a good starting wage, and has never asked for a raise, or had one, despite multiple promotions.

* She inherited a car a few months ago and sold it. She had offers online from $18k-$25k, but sold it to the first person who showed up for $10k.

* She caught someone stealing her bike at college. The woman stealing the bike managed to convince my fiance that it was actually her bike and my fiance just let her take it, despite the fact that she caught the woman cutting her bike lock.

* Last spring was my 30th birthday and she ordered a giant chocolate cake for the party. The cake normally comes with nuts, but given my allergy for nuts she ordered it without them. Well when she went to pick it up and it had nuts on it, she just paid for it and brought it home. I couldn't even be in the same room as the cake.

Which brings us to tomorrow. My father recently passed away and I need to fly to the other end of the country to get things sorted out with family, attend the funeral, etc.. Meanwhile, we recently had a pipe burst in our home, and the contractors will be out tomorrow to fix it. My flight's at 6am and my fiance will have to handle it, including all the negotiations because we don't know the extent of the damages.

I've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners? I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.

We've talked about it a few times before, but it's been unproductive. She's convinced she's just being nice and doesn't like confrontation, then brings up examples of extremely confrontational people. I think she puts her aversion to conflict above her/our long term goals, and she needs to find a happy medium. She doesn't understand how negatively this is impacting her life.

But at the same time, we've had some amazing years together and she really is a great person. We're compatible in almost every other way. So is this over like I think it is? Is there any way I can get through to her? Should I tell her I'm thinking about leaving?

tl;dr: Fiance is a self-described ""people pleaser"", it's caused her to make a lot of terrible mistakes and I'm thinking about leaving her."
"My sister [23F] is causing a scene because I [28F] am skipping her wedding in favor of my sister-in-law's [29F] wedding. I don't know what to do.


I've been married to my husband for a year now, we dated for 3 years for that. His sister (my SIL) and I are pretty good friends. 9 months ago she got engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I happily accepted. She sent out invitations about a month later, inviting me and my husband (obviously), as well as my parents. My parents also said they would be attending. The wedding is set to be towards the end of August, so not long from now.

Well, about a month ago, my little sister got engaged, too. For the record, my sister and I have never been incredibly close. And I personally think she is far too young to be getting married, but I told her I was happy for her and fully plan on being supportive. 

That is, until I found out when the wedding was. August, literally the day before my SIL's wedding. To be clear, my SIL, my husband, and I live on the west coast. My sister and my parents live in Florida. So I could either bail on my SIL, who I said I would be in her wedding months ago, or I could go to my sister's wedding, where I'm not even in the bridal party and didn't know when her wedding was until about a week ago. Not only would airfare be pretty expensive at this point, there is no way I can be at both. Plus, my SIL's wedding is going to be this whole big thing, whereas my sister's is a small backyard wedding. 

I don't know what to do. I think my sister is being very selfish, especially considering she knew when my SIL's wedding was. But she's causing a big uproar over it and my parents are kind of torn on the issue, too. Do I bail on my SIL and go to my sister's wedding? Or do I skip it and do what I promised I would months ago? I know it's my sister...but she's kind of pissing me off with all of this and acting like a brat What do I do?

"My cousin's [31M and 32F] are blaming my son [9M] for the fact that their house got robbed while they were ""babysitting,"" and me [28M] and my wife [30F] are expected to make good on their loss

"My [32F] Minister husband [37M] had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she got pregnant. I have filed for divorce but people from the town/church still treat me like I'm the Minister's wife and won't listen when I nicely tell them to stop


This is my first time posting here but I would greatly appreciate some insight into my situation from people who are outside of it. I [32F] have been married to my Minister husband [37M] for 7 years when I found out that he had been having an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she has become pregnant. Despite his words and begging me to forgive him I have chosen to file for divorce. It was difficult because I had been married to him for so long, 7 years, and we had a 2 year courtship before we were married. He has been in my life a long time but despite him asking I could not forget the affair. He now lives with the woman he had an affair with and their child and he was removed from his job as the Minister once the affair became public. I am renting a townhouse and am working a full time job now.

The problem I am having is that many of the people in the town and in the church still see me as the Minister's wife. My husband was the Minister for 5 years and I often prayed with and supported people during difficult times, such as during the sickness or death of a loved one or during marital difficulties. Even though I have filed for divorce and am no long living with my husband, these people are still asking me to carry out these duties. I do care for these people but because I am now working full time I no longer have the time that I used to. It doesn't help that the Minister who replaced my husband is unmarried and there is no wife for them to go to in my place. I do not mind attending the odd charitable event in my spare time or visiting occasionally to have tea or pray but I cannot do this all the time like I used to. The people from the town and the church have been nothing but kind to me from the outset of this instead of encouraging me to stay with my husband, and I truly do not believe they are doing this out of malice, but I don't know what else I can do. I have gently reminded them that I am no longer the Minister's wife but they either don't listen or say things like ""I don't mind dear"". I don't want to be angry, rude or forceful because as I said they are not doing it because they are bad people. I believe they are just so used to me doing it that it's comfort for them. How can I can I kindly, gently and nicely get them to stop treating me like I am the Minister's wife? Thank you everyone for your time.

tl;dr summary: My [32F] husband [37M] was the Minister of the church for five years until he was removed because he had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F]. I have filed for divorce and the church has a new (unmarried) Minister. People still ask me to do the things I did when I was the Minister’s wife (such as charitable endeavors, visiting their sick loved ones etc.) and even though they are not malicious they don’t listen when I say no or ask them to stop, I think because they are so used to it and the new Minister is unmarried. That’s the summary of my situation."
"[UPDATE] My half-sister [14 F] has said she'd like to change her last name to my father's [38 M]


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nkrz3/my_halfsister_14_f_has_said_shed_like_to_change/)

So quite a bit happened since the original thread. 

But let me first answer a question from the last thread that I didn't see until I logged in right now: 

&gt;So, does she have her mum's last name at the moment or the errant father's?

Her father's. Mom thought that somewhere down the line she might reconnect with her father and figured having his last name could help her with that. And if not, she could easily change it if she wished to do so.

Anyway, both me and my sister got quite the bomb dropped on us after we brought up the last name change to our mom. Turns out our parents are dating! They've actually been dating for the past year and we just never really caught onto it. I feel so clueless, but looking back, yeah, the signs were there. They didn't want to tell us anything because they were afraid what might happen if they broke it off too prematurely. So yeah, that happened. It's really weird. But also really great! 

Amanda pretty much still can't stop smiling whenever she sees our dad and absolutely loves that she can call him that to his face now. And in regards to the name change, yeah, our parents are more than fine with it, and our dad actually cried a bit when Amanda asked him if he wouldn't mind her doing that. It was a really emotional moment for us all.

**tl;dr: Mom and dad are dating - have been dating for the past year - Amanda started calling my father ""Dad"", he agreed with the name change after making sure that was what she wanted. Everything went better than expected!**"

"My wife [30] THINKS she can sing, and it's driving me [29M] up the wall, and now she wants to sing at her sister's wedding


Been married six years. I love my wife dearly.


She thinks she can sing. She's always thought that she is a good singer, but honestly she is a terrible singer. I'm not saying I'm this great judge of singing talent because I'm not. But I know what sounds good, and my wife doesn't.


An example might be that we're in the car, and she'll hear a song she likes on the radio, and she'll just start singing aloud, really loudly to the song.


She'll sing loudly at home too while she's going about tasks.


I'm not a jerk and I know the difference of someone singing for joy and just being happy, and me, as witness to it, should just live and let live. I know the difference between that and someone who just sings so loudly and badly off key that it is actually painful and obnoxious to listen to.


In the car especially, her singing is so painful that it impairs my concentration. I want to tell her to not do it anymore but I don't want to sound mean and I know her ego is really telling her that she has a great voice.


My wife's sister [28] is getting married at the end of the year, and in talking about entertainment at her wedding, my wife volunteered to sing songs. My wife's sister and I suddenly looked at each other as if we'd secretly been discussing this the whole time, but we never said it before, not even once.


But it's like we both knew the other one knew that my wife cannot sing. My sister in law took me aside and said, ""Jack you know she can't sing and I'm not going to let her do this.""


But how do we let her down easy and tell her we don't want to sing? I don't want to tell her it's because her voice sucks and she's tone-deaf, because that would just kill her.


She's insisting that she wants to do this ""favor"" free of charge for her sister.


I also want to find a way to get her to stop singing without hurting her feelings.


In other ways she's really talented. She's a great cook, she draws well, she does her own makeup and other women's makeup, she is good at reading aloud (she volunteers reading at the library to kids).


Any ideas?

"[UPDATE] I [33 M] found a picture of my girlfriend's [30F] wedding day. She never mentioned being married.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vto3v/i_33m_found_a_picture_of_my_girlfriends_30f/


I would like to thank everyone for their input.


We talked last night, I told her that I found pictures and she was confused and asked where, then she nonchalantly said 'oh, I forgot about that pics.'


Long story short, when she was in early 20s, she moved to France. She met a guy there, they fell in love. He was a rich Jew, she described herself as eastern European *gender slur word*, like his parents called her. They got married few months after they met. She just turned 23. His parents were super pissed and put a lot of pressure on him. Eventually reality hit them. They were both young and stubborn and they split after 2 years of marriage.



I asked her if she was embarrassed about failed marriage so that's why she didn't tell me. She said no. She said that she loved him, that they were happy. She said that with huge smile like when you are reminiscing about good, old memories which make your heart warm. I asked why she never mentioned him. She said that she didn't know what to tell. She never got closure. Eventually she started to believe that his family was right, she was unimportant to him and that their love never mattered. That it was all just a random fling, just signed papers that meant nothing. She left it behind her, didn't want to waste even more time justifying her decision or talking about him when she never knew what she was to him.



She gave me his contact information if I want to check with him. I did that, I admit I was curious. I said that I am dating Petra and that I just found out she was married... He saw my message in the evening, but he replied around 2 am. He shortly said yes, they were married for two years and they are legally divorced. An hour later he said (I translated this) 'It was a small wedding of two fools on a sunny day in December. That day crosses my mind often and never fails to make me smile. We were young and in love, I wish that I was stronger. She is amazing woman.'


So... That's it.


**Edit**


Few more things: Today she went on vacation (she offered to cancel it) so I will have some time to think about everything.

By mentioning that he was Jewish, I didn't mean to imply anything. I just quoted her words and thought that it was important to mention their different cultural background.

"My wife [42] and I [39M] own a successful restaurant, and our relatives are always trying to shame us into hiring them/their kids to work for us


Wife and I have been married ten years. Four years ago we decided to open a restaurant. My wife worked at a daycare center and I was the manager of a bar and grill. We both gave up our careers to try something new.


We opened a small but upscale Italian restaurant. My wife and I are both of Italian heritage (I speak Italian but she doesn't). We borrowed about four hundred thousand dollars at the bank. We never asked help or advice from our families, and we didn't want any, either. Members on both sides of our families took it upon themselves to tell us how stupid we were to try our hand at business, though. Scoff, scoff, scoff--that's what many of them did.


Besides our kitchen staff of four people (one chef, one sous-chef, and two assistants, there are nine employees who are all part time and rotate: we usually have two servers during lunch and four at dinner. Plus we have one custodian.


All of our employees are experienced professionals. Our most experienced server is fifty years old, full-blood Sicilian, and has been a professional server for thirty six years.


Needless to say, our restaurant lost money for a while as could be expected. Over the last two years though we started to pull slight profits and are slowly climbing out of the red.


My wife and I will still be paying back the bank for at least six or seven years, and that's if this year's positive outcomes continue. We get great reviews on Yelp and other sites, and we're very popular in the community.


---and now, here come the relatives. It's always some cousin or other relation talking about how their teenager needs experience, won't you let him work for you, or, I need extra income, can I be a server, do you make big tips?


It makes me sick. 


I already have all the staff I need at the moment, and I tell them this, but they act like I'm being selfish if I don't want to hire them or their relation, or that I'm choosing not to hire them because I only want to hire members from the other side of the family. Both sides of the family make the same claim, and the fact is my wife and I are the only ""related"" people in the whole business.


They seem to have this idea in their head that since our restaurant is popular, we're raking it in, and that our servers are making sixty grand a year with tips. Nonsense.


Worse is that none of our relatives have any experience serving, yet uncle so and so or aunt what's her face thinks their kid deserves to work at our restaurant because I'm their uncle or whatever.


Family members are already starting to gossip about how we're greedy and unwilling to share our success. I keep trying to explain that we're not yet ""successful"" if we still owe more than three hundred fifty thousand dollars to Chase Manhattan Bank, but they just don't seem to get it, and they keep yapping their mouths, too.


There have been a couple of recent, weird negative reviews online for our restaurant, which came coincidentally after I rejected a nephew's request to be a waiter.


Is there anything I can do about these people? Any way to make them get off my back and understand that just because I own a restaurant, doesn't mean I need to give all their kids a job?


---

tl;dr

Opened a restaurant with wife. Restaurant appears to be popular and thriving. Cue all the leech relatives looking for a job and expecting an easy hire because I'm their uncle/cousin. Don't want to give them jobs. Now they're leaving bad reviews for us online, and gossiping about us calling us cheap."

I'm twenty-nine, married to a lovely woman [30] and have a baby at home [1F]. I work in accounting and have achieved quite a lot since graduating college six years ago: I manage a small department of eight other accountants, and earn close to a six figure salary. I'm fit, strong, and athletic. I work out regularly (running, hitting the speedbag, weights).


In high school, I was a skinny nerd. From 9th grade through 10th, I didn't have any girlfriends; in fact I didn't get laid until I was in college. I had friends, but they were all nerds, too.


In 8th grade, I had a friend, ""Josh."" Josh and I used to be best friends in middle school. We were into the same things, like Nintendo 64 and Playstation 2, graphic novels, and tinkering with computers.


In 9th grade, Josh completely changed. He suddenly wanted to be the ""cool"" kid and always kissed up to the popular kids in school to try to join their groups. He succeeded for the most part. I didn't want to follow his example because I thought he was being fake.


In the middle of 9th grade, Josh hit his growth spurt and grew over six feet tall. I was impressed but otherwise uninterested. Because he was only in 9th grade but already really tall and well-built, girls started noticing him, even ones in grades above ours, and he definitely became a popular kid.


I thought that was cool, good for him, but then he started picking on me in the quad for some reason. Like, he couldn't just leave me alone and be popular and live his life. It's like he actually sought me out to humiliate me.


In the school quad at lunch, him and his popular friends would come up to me, and I'd usually be sitting with one or two other nerdy kids, and he'd say, ""Look at this little [homophobic slur]. He used to always have a little crush on me in middle school.""


And of course his friends would eat it up. I didn't mind if a bunch of dumb guy bullies made fun of me, but it especially stung because girls would laugh at me too due to his treatment. I wrote for the school web newspaper, and my picture was on the website. Josh and his friends right-click-saved it and taped it to my locker, with a fake thought-bubble containing various homophobic material.


I could deal with all that, the humiliation, the needless mockery, but by tenth grade Josh actually began to bully me physically. He'd shove me into the wall if he were walking nearby. He was very popular by this time, always had a pretty girlfriend, always with a crew of other popular guys. I was always in more advanced classes than him so I avoided him academically, but in 9th and 10th grade I had to take Physical Education (state law), and just my luck. Josh was taking PE during the same period. 


He wasn't in my class (three PE teachers shared the same field) but when the teachers let us do ""free activity"" which they did every day for thirty minutes, Josh and his friends would shove me around again. One time in PE I actually tried to stand up to Josh and called him out for being a fake and a coward, always traveling with his crew.


Josh didn't like this, so he challenged me to fight him one on one right then and there. I was only fourteen and scared, much smaller than him. Someone behind me shoved me forward and I crashed into Josh. He shoved me back and punched me in the face. I didn't cry or anything that embarrassing, but I went down with a bleeding lip.


The teacher broke it up and Josh got suspended for two days. When he came back he'd always threaten to ""kill"" me. I asked my parents if I could switch schools. I always got really good grades so my parents trusted me when I said I wasn't feeling challenged by my teachers.


I eventually changed to a different and as it turned out better high school. I was still a nerd, but there were lots of nerds and I didn't get bullied anymore. Still didn't have girlfriends, but I was having a much better high school experience.


Except Josh and his friends found out different gaming messageboards I posted to, and joined up just to troll and make fun of me. This lasted for quite a while, with Josh always calling me the P-word, various homophobic slurs, and always saying he would beat me up if he ever saw me on the street.


Eventually he got tired of it and left me alone. By eleventh grade the bullying stopped, except for one brief period in 2005 when he found me on Myspace through mutual acquaintances and verbally abused me on social media for a while. The way I'm writing it makes it seem unemotional but at the time it was absolutely awful. But eventually that too, stopped, and I didn't see Josh again.


--Until yesterday, when our company hired a new junior accountant. And who did it happen to be? Josh. And where was he assigned? Why, to my department of course.


When I met him he didn't recognize me right away. I had grown a lot since 10th grade. In 12th grade I finally hit my growth spurt and became tall, even taller than Josh. And I worked out a lot in college. I was always a nerd, even in college, but I was an athletic nerd and ran the sprints for the track team, and played lacrosse. I didn't have any trouble with women in college, and always had a girlfriend. I met my wife, who was a year ahead of me, in my junior year. We married after six months together and have been happy ever since.


Josh looks for the most part the same but older and is balding slightly. He has a gut and is nowhere near as athletic as me. I knew him the second I saw him. My boss introduced me to him, and let me say my own full name to Josh. When I did so, Josh looked like he saw a ghost.


He didn't say anything to indicate that he knew me. I only told him I would be his supervisor, and ""your desk will be right there."" I gave him a guidebook and told him to come to me with any questions. I told him there would be a department meeting Wednesday (tomorrow) afternoon. I didn't do the whole ""so tell me a little about yourself"" bit that I do with all of the other new hires I supervise.


Josh hasn't made real eye-contact with me once since yesterday. Sometimes I'll be looking at him, remembering how much he hurt me when we were kids. He'll look up, meet my eyes, then quickly look back at his own computer.


Seeing him makes me feel flush with the pain I used to feel fifteen years ago, and all the bullying and pain and hurt come flooding back. My head is hot and my heart is racing just typing this. I'm really supposed to be typing a numbers report (I already finished) but instead I'm pretending to work while I am on Reddit. I'm looking at him right now, and he's deliberately refusing to make eye contact with me because he knows I'm looking.


I have ZERO doubt that I could beat the living sh-- out of this clown if he tried to bully me today. I could literally end his life if he tried to punk me again, and even if I took it easy on him I would turn him into a quadriplegic. 


I am fighting so hard not to walk on over to him right this second and backhand slap him across his stupid face and dare him to do something about it.


I just don't know what to do. I know that sooner or later (and probably tomorrow) I'm going to have to sit down in close proximity to this person, and I'm going to have to let him know that I know who he is. And he'll know what that means. He knows I remember all the crap he pulled, how badly he hurt me when we were kids.


I just don't know what to do from there, though. I have to work with this guy. I don't want to be his friend, but I don't know if I should work to be his enemy, either.


Advice appreciated, thanks.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wguxk/i_20m_recently_found_out_my_girlfriend_of_6_years/

First of all I would like to say thank you for the helpful answers I received in my first post, and would also like to thank the people who respectfully disagreed with me. I would also like to apologise for getting angry at the people who tried to insult me for my opinion, but getting told ""she's better off without you"" etc when I feel like I've done nothing wrong is a low blow.

So on to the update. Last night I decided late on I'd go to a party where people I went to school with etc were at one of my old friends houses. The awkward thing though is I didn't know Alison would be there, who is Sophie's best friend from our area.

Me and Alison have always gotten along really, we were never particularly close but we've never had a problem with each other. She saw me and told me that whilst she doesn't agree with the camming behind my back (apparently she's known for awhile) and told Sophie to tell me, she's upset that we split up and so is Sophie.

I told Alison that it's more than just being a cam girl, it's the fact I didn't have the choice to be OK with it, the fact she's doing it and blowing it on drink and whatever else on a weekend and how I felt undervalued that she would prefer to make money this way than try to save our relationship.

Alison said she could see my point but Sophie sees it differently according to her and thinks that I should be OK with it because I never knew what was going on and it didn't effect me in anyway. I said that people being physically cheated on don't know what's going on, but it still effects them, this is how I felt and that I obviously valued sex differently to Sophie these days. That it would be best to go no contact to save us heart ache as we've obviously developed into two different people, and if Alison could tell her that, that would be great.

Just about 25 minutes ago I received a text from Alison saying that she told Sophie what I'd said, and Sophie said that it's her body she can do what she wants and that shouldn't concern me, that I'm being an idiot and should just accept ""that she makes more money doing this than I ever could to support herself"" (she showed me the text). Alison apparently unleashed on her because of how selfish she thought that was by Sophie, and I got the answer I needed in full, this isn't the same person I dated for 6 years. I've noticed changes slowly during University in her that I've ignored until now, but I feel like I just stayed with her because I loved her former self.

So now I'm single for the first time in my adult life, I'm going to do things I've missed out on considering my friends have always called me ""whipped"" and actually be one of the ""lads"".

---   
**tl;dr**: Went to a party, saw Sophie's best friend who offered to pass on a message to Sophie. Sophie insulted me to Alison saying she makes a lot more money doing this than I could ever provide her plus other things, which made me realise this isn't the same person I love, and even though I'm still upset, I've come to accept that the person I loved doesn't exist anymore."
"I [16M] am getting really disheartened. I am a foster child and I have moved 3 times. A family has adopted me and I am scared it's going to be like my foster homes.


I don't have a family, I literally don't have a family. I might have one with these new people but I am scared. They are coming to get me at around 2 today and I am really nervous. I am making the move from to a different city, thankfully still in my home state and all I can think is what if they are like the rest. 

My first three foster homes they people did not give a shit about me. I was denied food because I was better looking than their son. Their son was an obese 12 year old. The other homes were not all that great either. But I am officially being adopted and I am scared. My life has not been easy and it upsets me when I see kids talking about how they wish there parents bought them a PS4. I wish I had parents period. I have moved from school to school and have made and left friends. 

I am going to be a 16 year old sophomore because of how messed up my last foster home was. I was doing it last year but I was pulled out of it due to neglect and it messed up my whole school. So i need to do my sophomore year again. 

I am just really nervous and I was wondering how to make a first good impression. I am scared because I am happy to be adopted, but at the same time terrified because I worried it's going to be like the rest. Their daughters who are around my age seem nice enough, the mom seems nice enough. But so did my foster familys at first. 

do you have any advice for me?

tl;dr: I have been adopted and I am scared it's going to be bad like my foster homes.

"UPDATE: I [26F] burnt my face really bad with a curling iron. I work in a corporate office - What should I do?


Here's the link to the original post &gt;&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wszgo/i_26f_burnt_my_face_really_bad_with_a_curling/


Hope I did that right...


On to the update! Again, I want to thank everyone for their advice. I was pretty amazed at all the help and seriously all of your comments were super supportive - Seriously, incredible. Thank you. I was feeling pretty stupid and embarrassed.


So, about an hour after I made the original post I ran out to the pharmacy and got a bunch of Band-Aids and antibiotic cream. (Side note: By this point the burn was raw and borderline an open wound.) My first priority (which I wouldn't have really thought about, thanks to you kind Redditors) was to make sure it didn't scar my face. My game plan was to slap a Band-Aid on it and re-dress the would throughout the day and apply antibiotic cream as needed. I went to work pretty early to get to my office before everyone else, and when people did make comments I was honest that I got attacked by a curling iron, and most of my colleagues just plain felt really bad that I burned my face that badly. I had a meeting today with the big wigs (the CEO, COO, EVP and my boss) and the CEO's first comment when I walked into the room was, ""Well, I hope you look better than the other guy!"" I actually thought it was pretty hilarious and overall the meeting went well, even though I felt INCREDIBLY AWKWARD.


Now onto the not so great news. After the meeting I went to the bathroom to check on the burn. It. Looked. Terrible. I borderline had a panic attack - thought my face was falling off. My boss was super supportive and I ended up leaving and going to urgent care. The doctor said it looked a little infected, but prescribed me some antibiotic/steroid/burn cream that should help the healing process move along a lot quicker. She also advised to NOT put anything over it, no makeup and no Band-Aid! The burn still looks terrible but she said it should heal up nicely over the next 7-days as long as I take care of it. I ended up working from home the rest of the day - it was kind of nice.


So, TIL (for anyone in the future with a raw/open wound burn)...
-Go to the Doctor's RIGHT WAY!!! THIS, THIS, THIS!!!
-Do not cover it with makeup or a Band-Aid, just let it breath
-No one gives a crap at your work about your face, they might feel bad but no one really cares LOL


tl;dr: Went to work with a Band-Aid over it. Colleagues asked what happened, was honest that a curling iron attacked me - played it off lightheartedly. Most of them just felt bad. The meeting with the big wigs went fine. Burn ended up getting infected and I ended up at Urgent Care. Doctor prescribed the APPROPRIATE cream, and I'm not supposed to put makeup or Band-Aids over the wound. Going to work tomorrow - I feel kind of bad people have to look at this hideous thing, but oh well. It does seem like it's healing now!"
"I [25F] am terrified of my new landlord [50sM] and can't tell if I'm being paranoid.


Three weeks ago I moved into an apartment in a new city where I know no one. I found the place after driving by and spotting a For Rent sign.


When I came in to sign the lease, the landlord ""Sal"" told me that he was a full colonel in the army and was a POW for five months in Iraq. He told me about how he escaped and was awarded a medal by the Vice President. I tried to look this up online and there's absolutely nothing. Wouldn't you think there'd be an article or two about a full colonel escaping the clutches of an Iraqi POW camp? But I figured, hey I'm not in the military. What do I know.


After I moved in I started to notice how quiet the building is. At first I thought it was a good thing, but it occurred to me after my second week living here that *I haven't seen a single person besides Sal inside this building.* Each of the 20 mailboxes in the lobby has a tenant name. I snapped a picture of them on my way out this morning and searched every name on Facebook and Google. Not a single one of them has my city listed on their profile: in fact, all of them list Baltimore, Maryland as their current city (thousands of miles from the apartment building). When I searched Sal's full name, he also had Baltimore related things come up.


Sal hasn't done anything outwardly threatening or creepy to me; he's been friendly enough. From day one I sensed that there was something a little ""off"" about him, but I thought maybe he *was* in the military, just not to the extent he told me, and had PTSD or something similar.


But after looking up the other ""tenants"", I am seriously frightened. I called my parents and they seemed to think I was being paranoid. I don't have friends to stay with yet, and I can't afford a hotel for more than a couple of nights.



Am I leaping to wild conclusions, or is there something strange going on here?


**tl;dr:** I'm afraid my new landlord is not who he says he is, and I'm scared.


**Edit:** Sal lives on-site, down the hall from me.

**Update: I'm in a hotel for the night so I can have some time to figure this out without panicking. I'm doing some further internet snooping to see if I can dig up any dirt on Sal. Will keep you posted.**

**UPDATE!!!:** THANK YOU so much to everyone who messaged to check in on me-- I'm okay but the last few days have been really crazy and I haven't been able to log back on. I know we're only allowed one update so I'm waiting until I can give you the whole story. But yes, I'm okay!"

"Was I (24f) wrong to discipline my cousin's(22f) daughter (4f)


A little background here, my whole family has always been the 'odd man out' in our extended family, and even more so my brother (27m) and I. We have very different political and religious views, and escaped our small town to move to a big city. I've also expressed my desire to be child free until at least my 30s and focus on my career, while my cousins got married right out of high school and started having babies. So things tend to be a bit tense anyway.


Yesterday my cousin was over with her two children. They were at an event close to my house and stopped by to use my restroom, change diapers etc. Her oldest daughter, Ruby(4) started playing with one of my cats. This cat is incredibly sweet and calm and I'm actually looking to register him as a therapy animal. However, he does have his claws (which is another thing my family and I disagree on - they've always declawed their cats) and like any animal will get defensive if he is hurt.

Ruby was petting him and started to pull on his tail and pick him up by his front legs. He started mewing and my cousin said in a sing-song baby voice 'Now Ruby, play gentle with kitty.' Ruby ignored her and got more rough, to the point my cat was crying in pain and hissed for maybe the first time in his life. Since my cousin wasn't doing anything, I said in a very stern voice 'Ruby, leave the cat alone. You are hurting him and he is trying to ask you to stop and you're ignoring him. He's going to scratch you.'


This made Ruby extremely pouty and she was sniffling but she stopped. I told her thank you and maybe later she could try to pet him again. My cousin called me into the other room and was FURIOUS, said I had no right to discipline her child, I acted like a bitch when I did, and I wasn't even a parent and didn't know what I was doing. She left shortly after. 


Now I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not. My cousin told the rest of my family and I've been getting angry messages ever since. I don't think this is a situation I'll be in again since I'm sure my cousin won't be coming back. If I end up dealing with this with friend's kids in the future, did I act correctly? Looking for advice. Also I apologize for formatting, on mobile.

Tl;dr: Cousin's daughter was playing rough with cat, she wasn't really stopping her so I stepped in and did. Cousin says it was wrong for me to discipline someone else's child, not sure who is right here


Edit: Wow, I was out for a few hours and got a ton more responses than I expected. Thank you everyone who reassured me!
I've talked to my grandmother since I posted this and when I explained what had actually happened, she basically ignored me and focused on how I need to declaw my cat so he can't scratch. This isn't an option and I made it clear that if they were that worried maybe it was best they not come to my house. I'm sure this will cause other issues but I'm sticking to my guns and protecting my animals. Thank you everyone who has replied so far!


Edit 2: So today I heard second hand (cousin told aunt who told mom who told me) that I had yelled at Ruby and she was only gently petting the cat. She also apparently didn't realize my cats have claws and was upset I didn't warn her when she came over. I would try to explain what really happened except they (aunts family) all blocked me on social media...I'm realizing this problem goes way beyond this one incident and was probably bound to happen sooner or later. Thank you everyone for your support! I feel much better knowing I didn't overstep

Edit 2.2: this isn't the first time my family has been blocked for silly things and apparently my mom made a comment to my aunt about not being ready to be a grandma which, given circumstances, upset my aunt. So things had been boiling for a while in the background that I didn't know about"

"My [24F] boyfriend [25M] is furious because I decided to get rid of my bed and sleep in the closet.


I just moved into a new apartment which is much tinier than my old one, but in a nicer area. It's a studio with a huge walk in closet. On my first night here I didn't have any furniture yet, so I threw my TempurPedic mattress topper on the floor of the closet and slept in there. It was actually super cozy and comfortable, so I decided to stick with it. I've now furnished the rest of the apartment like a normal living room, and I sleep in the closet every night. Now, I realize that this is kind of quirky and bizarre, but I don't usually have people over, and I like saving the floor space. 


My boyfriend of 5 months came over for the first time this morning and was shocked to see my sleeping arrangements. At first I laughed at his reaction, but then I realized that he was actually, genuinely upset. I would understand if it was a sex thing and he didn't feel like banging on the floor, but we rarely spend time at my place because both of our jobs are much closer to his house (and also, he has an actual house as opposed to a studio apartment). He texted me after leaving and said he was really upset by the lack of a bed, and he would take me to the store this weekend and buy me one. 


I'm extremely pissed off by this, and I want to know if it's justified. His reaction and text made me feel like a) he has no sense of humor about life, and b) he feels ""responsible"" for me in a creepy patriarchal way. 



I know it seems like a dumb thing to break up over, but this is my first actual relationship, and I don't like that I already feel disrespected. Am I being an idiot? Is he? 



**EDIT: Should have made this much much clearer. He was not expressing shocked concern or even mild irritation. His exact words were, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? Only a lunatic would live like this."" He had raised his voice at this point and I told him to stop yelling, as we were in an apartment building. He stormed out and went home even though we had plans later that night. His text came about an hour later.**

"Ten years ago I [43M] caused the death of my daughter. I feel like I need closure with my ex-wife [43F]. Is it selfish?


I've been debating posting here for three weeks. I don't know how to begin putting this into words so I'll just start. Ten years ago my wife and I were happily married with a beautiful healthy baby girl. Through a mix of bad luck and unforgivable stupidity, I caused her tragic death when she was just 11 months old. At the time I dealt with it in the worst possible way. I became a terrible person, cut ties with every single person in my life, and threw myself furiously into my career. I left my wife and never looked back. Over this last decade I had frequent panic attacks, but those were the only times I let myself think about my old life and what I had done. Otherwise I was completely in denial. 


Something happened to me recently that made me wake up. When everything hit me I couldn't deal and tried to kill myself, but I fucked it up and I'm still here. (Not planning to try again at the moment but I know a lot of people will think I should.) Now that I'm ""back to my senses"" I'm trying to cope with my guilt, but i know my life is ruined forever. 



My wife will never and should never forgive me. But I feel that I owe it to her to at least let her know how much I'm suffering now. Maybe it would help her. 


What do you think?

"My sisters (19/18F) and parents (57M/54F) are bothering me about why I (29F) don't wish to provide my sisters with extra money for fun, I'm already paying their full University fees.


So there's 4 of us girls, the 3 mentioned in the title and 1 other sister, 26 years of age.


I came into a considerable amount of money about 4 years ago, well, it's more like I got very lucky with some financial decisions and it paid very well. I was able to pay off my parents mortgage for them, purchase a nice home for myself and at 25, I had enough money to live comfortably after paying off my own school loans as well as that of my other sister. 


When my 2 youngest sisters started University last year, I decided I'd pay for them to go to college, rather than have them take out loans and have to pay back a lot of money, spend years paying it off and all of that, so that's that. Their University fees for 3 years are taken care of. 


Now the problem is that my mom recently asked if I could provide them with extra money, when I asked why  she seemed to hesitate before telling me it's for them to be able to spend on going out, spending time with friends etc


My 2 youngest sisters adore partying, they were quite popular in high school and in our country they've got a lot of their friends at the same University, they like going clubbing and drinking at bars every couple weeks. Nothing is wrong with that but I don't see why I should have to pay for them to do this, my other sister and I both worked part time in university so if we wanted to buy anything or go out with friends or whatever, we could do it with our own money, especially as we didn't come from a wealthy family by any means. 


I said no. Thought my mom dropped it. Then my dad brought it up. Then Mt 2 youngest sisters. Their argument is it wouldn't dent what I have in the slightest to provide them with spending money while they're studying, that it'd be easier if they had the money available rather than having to balance school and a job. I do not think that's fair in the slightest considering I'm shelling out over 75k each. It's not a problem to give them money, I just don't think I should have to when I'm already paying off their school fees in full. 


Not to mention they both want about 2000 to 3000 a month for the 3 years they're at school. For shopping, buying things for parties, going drinking etc. Again they've pointed out it wouldn't hurt my decent sized fortune to do this and it's true but I really think if they want to enjoy themselves, they should work for it especially since they don't need to worry about paying back loans or anything. 




**tl;dr** :  I'm paying my 2 sisters fill University fees, they both enjoy going out to parties and clubs, parents and the two of them want me to give them extra money to spend on these things "

"My boyfriend [30M] admitted to ""tracking"" me [27F] on business trips. I feel violated and he thinks he did nothing wrong because it was out of concern.


We've been together 2 years, lived together for about 4 months. 

Anyway, my job requires a lot of travel. I work on a team of 4 people and we often travel once a month for a few days, and every few months for a week. This has always been my job, BF has never voiced any concern about it, and has never said a word about the travel bothering him. I'm always very upfront about where I'm going, how long I'll be gone, and who on the team is going, too. I know he's been mildly suspicious of one of the guys on the team before, but our relationship is purely platonic and has been since my boyfriend and I started dating. No worries there. 

Anyway, last Friday my team and I were all driving back to town after doing some work a few states over. I was texting my boyfriend in the car as I normally do, telling him where we currently were, when I'd be home, just normal chit-chat to pass the time. I told him we were probably going to stop for lunch at this really famous restaurant about 30 miles from where we live. 

So we did that. While we were getting ready to leave, I saw my boyfriend across the street in this little coffee shop/ice cream parlor place. I was really surprised to see him there since it was the middle of the day and he should've been at work. Plus, he had no reason to be there. I thought maybe he had come to surprise me, so I crossed the street and went over to talk to him. When he saw me coming he looked like I had caught him. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was sent on an ""errand"" by his boss to this town. This didn't really sound right to be considering there was nothing in this town that couldn't be accomplished in either our city or in another one much closer. I asked again what he was doing there, this time kinda thinking he hadn't planned on me seeing him. He then said that since we had mentioned stopping in a town so close, he would come meet us and then I could ride home with him so we had time to catch up. Again, weird I thought, especially since he could've told me that. But I dropped it for the time being and we left together.

On the ride back I brought it up again and asked what he was really doing because I really wasn't buying his story. This is when he admitted to me that he often will drive by places I say I am on business trips to see if I'm really there. If we're staying less than 2 or 3 hours away, he'll drive to that town to see if my car is really outside the hotel I'm staying at. If I say we're stopping somewhere on the drive home, he'll go there and see what I'm really doing, if everything is platonic like I say it is, etc.

I feel hugely violated. For one, he has never mentioned feeling so insecure about my relationship with my coworkers. Secondly, he trusts me *so little* that he will drive 2 hours to the Best Western four towns over just to make sure I'm really there when I say I am?! 

*He* says that he's not doing anything wrong. He's not tracking my phone or reading my messages. That it's his right to drive to another town if he wants to, and he's only doing it out of concern for our relationship and its integrity.

I'm not crazy, am I? I think this is totally insane and I'm not sure I want to be in a relationship with someone like that. But he's so insistent that he's done nothing wrong, I don't know. I guess I just need advice on what to do.

"My [26F] boyfriend's [27M] younger brother [21M] trashed our new apartment, and the landlord got involved. My boyfriend doesn't think it's that big of a deal. What can I do here?


Trying to keep this short. Using a throwaway.

My boyfriend Kyle and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 1, and just recently moved into a new apartment together. Kyle has a younger college-aged brother, Brandon, who is a sweet guy but pretty immature. I love Kyle's family...Kyle and Brandon are close, too, so we see Brandon every so often. 

Brandon lives in another state, where he goes to school. He's on summer break right now, and asked if he could come and visit Kyle and I and see our new apartment. Kyle and I had existing plans to go to a birthday party out of town, which conflicted with the day Brandon would be arriving in town to see us. 

Kyle asked if it was okay if Brandon stayed at our place for one night, while we were out of town. I was hesitant but agreed, and asked Kyle to tell Brandon to be considerate of our apartment and neighbors - i.e. no loud parties, no smoking in the apartment, etc. Basically, agreeing to the rules Kyle and I agreed to with our landlord when we signed the lease. 

Kyle left the keys for Brandon and texted him some ground rules — don't throw a party, here's the wifi password, don't smoke in the house. We have a pullout couch that turns into a bed, so we set it up for him before we left. Brandon thanked us both and said he was tired anyway and would probably just go to bed. 

The next morning, after the birthday party, Kyle texts Brandon and says we'll be home in about an hour and a half. No response. As we're on our way home, our landlord calls me and says he received noise complaints from the neighbors last night and that the neighbors had called the police. I sat there, stunned, and told him that we were out of town but a family member had been staying at the apartment. The landlord is livid at this point, saying that it's not okay for us to have guests over if they're going to disrespect the apartment and the other tenants. I tell him that I agree completely, and keep apologizing. At this point Kyle is whispering to me, ""What happened? What's going on?"" Once I get off the phone with the landlord, I'm in tears and I tell Kyle what happened. Kyle sits there quietly and says that we shouldn't jump to conclusions until we get back to the apartment. 

When we get home, I practically run up the stairs and burst into the apartment. Brandon is in *our* bed with a girl, and the house wreaks of cigarettes. Brandon immediately jumps out of bed and says, ""I didn't know you guys would be home so soon!! I was going to clean up!!"" I just stare at him in disbelief and walk to the living room.

The living room is covered in red solo cups, a broken glass, and smells like old beer. Our new kitchen table is set up like a beer pong table. There's someone's computer and speaker hooked up in the living room...and in the office, there's a guy passed out on the floor. 

I immediately burst into tears and Kyle starts screaming at Brandon, telling him to get the fuck out. Brandon screams back at Kyle and tells him to ""chill"" and I also start to scream at Brandon. The additional guy and girl that we don't know immediately wake up and run out of the apartment before we can say anything to them. 

Kyle and I spent the entire day cleaning quietly. I told Kyle that Brandon can never, ever stay at our apartment again. At this point, Kyle says that I'm overreacting and that while Brandon was an asshole, he doesn't think it's ""that big of a deal"". I'm in disbelief and Kyle and I get into an argument. 

In the meantime, we haven't heard a word from Brandon. Not even an apology. Kyle's parents called us and asked what had happened, because apparently Brandon called them and said he needed money to stay in a hotel room for the rest of his trip. 

I'm furious, confused, and Kyle and I still can't agree on this subject. I feel like I hate Brandon and am considering ending things with Kyle over this. 

What can I do in this situation? How do I move forward, and make sure Brandon pays for the damage he's done? 

TL;DR - Boyfriend's younger brother threw a party in our new apartment, while we weren't there. Boyfriend doesn't think it's that big of a deal. "

Woof. I will try to make this short but please forgive me if I ramble.

When I was in college, I had a rough patch with my sister, Gabrielle, and we were both very mean and vindictive to each other. It started with an inheritance that was rightfully hers, that my parents made her split with me. Long story short, she became resentful of having to share her money with me and kept track of every dollar I spent. She even reported to my parents anytime I went out drinking with friends, or doing anything I should not be doing, just so she could say, ""See, I told you we shouldn't have given her the money.""

I was 20 years old at the time and very resentful of having what felt like a PI intruding on my life and making my parents constantly yell at me, so I did the immature thing and kissed her boyfriend one Thanksgiving or Christmas (can't even remember).

Two years later, when my sister and my relationship was improved but not perfect, we got in a petty fight before her birthday party and I wound up flirting with her boyfriend as some kind of immature revenge. I remember the cringe faces my friends made at me for basically grinding with Gabrielle's boyfriend on the dance floor that night, and I'm still completely embarrassed of that memory even though it was five years ago.

Fast forward to now. My sister and I have a good relationship as we are both adults with confidence, stable careers, et cetera. It helps that we did not see each other as much because I moved across the country for several years. I've since moved back to the city close to our hometown, where my sister lives, and we have resumed weekly or bimonthly dinners with the family on Saturdays or Sundays.

Four dinners ago, my mom was remarking on the state of our relationship now and commenting on how silly it was that we used to get on so poorly. My sister joked that I was a ""shitty human being"" then and I'm not anymore. Her husband, Nick, reacted strongly to ""shitty human being"" so in defense of her word choice, my sister revealed the thing about me kissing her boyfriend once, and then grinding on another years later. I was a bit uncomfortable but we all laughed and went on with the rest of the night.

But since that dinner, I noticed Nick starting to flirt with me. I can't even explain some of the moments because they were wordless but I'll list the more blatant offenses below:

* That night we were watching TV and he said I looked like a certain actress on TV, who in that scene, happened to be wearing a very revealing outfit. I felt a little weird but figured I was the one being weird because he said it in front of my sister and she didn't flinch.

* Next time, he came to hang in my room while mom and sister cooked downstairs. He has done this once or twice before but this time, kept looking for pictures of my college days because he wanted to see what I looked like back when I was ""seducing Gabrielle's boyfriends.""

* He caught me going through my favorite fitness Instagrams (lots of booty shots I'll admit) and asked if I was watching porn. I said no and he exaggerated a disappointed expression and said, ""Let me know if you are.""

* He got too close to me in the kitchen and I said, ""You don't have to stand so close,"" to which he responded, ""Is it okay if I do?"" I said I preferred that he didn't and he made a narrowed eye face at me as if to convey being skeptical. I flat out said, ""Why are you being weird?"" He didn't give me a real answer.

I'm angry because he never really acted inappropriately around me before. We had a pretty good relationship and liked to talk about sports, movies, the like. I always felt he and my sister were a good match, and that he was a good husband. But now it seems he heard a story and saw it as his green light to start messing with me. I feel he sees me as someone who's word against him would be invalid because of my history, and I want very badly to prove him wrong and just tell my sister and even parents what is happening. 

But I don't feel that any of his offenses thus far sound big enough to report to someone about. At the same time, I don't want to keep going to dinner and just waiting to be harassed in some way or another, just so I can point it out.

I'm livid and I'm a little embarrassed and I don't know which way is best to approach the situation. I'm not comfortable telling anyone I know about this so I appreciate any insight or advice.

EDIT: A lot is being made of the will. When I say ""rightfully"" I mean legally. Grandmother wrote Gabrielle in because she was the older child but had always referred to it as ""our"" money. Many years back, Dad asked Mom to have Grandma legally change it and Mom went nuts on him, saying that was ugly and not how our family worked. Grandma did not know about my or Gabrielle's rough patch or any of my poor behavior, so the will was certainly not written with that in mind. This hurts to say now but she died thinking we were perfect young women.

I will be short, thanks for any input.




We have been together for 3 years now. Live together 1 year. I met Petra when she moved in Berlin. She is lovely and gorgeous.




I needed to ship something and I was searching for boxes in her closet. She has more than enough and she said that I can take it. I took 5-6 boxes from top shelf just to check which one suits the best. All the boxes had shoes in it, but only one was empty and had 2 pictures in it. 



One was a picture of her in a wedding dress with a guy in a suit from maybe 5-6 years ago. They were laughing. 
Second one was probably taken few seconds after and it was a picture of him kissing her cheek and she was showing a ring to a camera. On the back of the second photo was sentence in French, google translates it as 'you make me feel great Petra'.




She isn't home yet and I have no idea what to do. Is it okay to ask about it, or?




Tl;dr: my girlfriend was married, she never mentioned it. Is it my business to ask something about it?"

My cousin and I run a nightclub. The club was started by our dads (brothers) and each of us started working here when we were 18. Since three years ago, my dad and uncle have both been retired and we run the place now.

My GF and I have been dating for a year. She's from a foreign country. Apparently in their culture, cousin relationships and marriages are very prevalent. That has made her more than a little uncomfortable with this situation. She thinks she can't shake it out of her mind that this is waiting for something to happen between us. To me this is incredibly absurd. She's not asking me to make a change but she has told me that she's uncomfortable 5 times now and she wraps it around things like ""you two are spending time until late nights"" but that's really just the nightclub business. Your working hours are late at night.

The last time she mentioned this I told her that I would have understood if this was a random girl who I was working closely with but it's not. But she thinks if it's not a sibling it should count as ""other women"". She says her own parents are cousins.

I don't know how to respond if (really when) she brings it up again.

"My [27m] girlfriend's [26f] best friend [27f] can't carry a child, and asked my girlfriend to have her baby. My girlfriend is strongly considering it. Do I have a say here?


There are quite a few people in this story, so I'll break it down:

Me - 27m
Girlfriend - Nicole, 26f
Girlfriend's Best friend - Sarah, 27f
Best friend's husband - Mike, 28m

Where do I start. Nicole and I have been together for a little over three years, and live together. I have never loved any woman the way that I love Nicole. We've had serious discussions on marriage and kids, and I am planning to propose in the next year, maybe sooner. I already have a ring, which Sarah actually helped me pick out for Nicole. 

One of the things I have always loved about Nicole is her kindness and generosity. She's great with kids and I *know* she'll be a great mom..and I want kids, too! We both agreed that we don't want kids now, but can see them in the future. I'm at a great point in my career, and so is Nicole. We want to travel, save money, and do what mid-late 20 somethings like to do. 

Nicole and Sarah have been best friends since they were born. Their mom's are best friends, and they are best friends. Sarah is by far Nicole's closest friend, most of the time I think of them as sisters. Sarah and her husband Mike live in the same city as us, and we see them frequently. They are a great couple..in fact, it really doesn't feel like we're hanging out with another ""couple"" with them. Mike and I hang out semi-frequently and I would say we're good friends. 

Sarah, like Nicole, has always wanted kids. When she and Mike got married last year, Nicole and I made a bet on how soon it would be until Sarah was pregnant. Much to our surprise, Sarah and Mike admitted that they wanted to be married for at least a year before trying to have a kid. 

Which brings us to present day. According to Sarah, she and Mike have been trying to get pregnant for 6 months. Sarah eventually went to a doctor, who told her that it was something with her uterus (I can't remember what it's called...but she can't carry children). The doctor, however, told her that her eggs are healthy and that she should strongly consider surrogacy if they want to have children. Sarah told Nicole all about this during the process. There were a lot of tears from the both of them, and Nicole talked to me about it a lot as well. Sarah told Nicole that she was going to start looking for surrogates as soon as possible. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

Earlier this week, Sarah was over at our place. I was in the bedroom watching a movie, but I could hear that Nicole and Sarah were having a serious conversation. After Sarah left, Nicole came into the bedroom and told me that she had something important that we needed to talk about. 

Sarah asked Nicole if she would be the surrogate for her baby. After researching, Sarah realized that surrogates are extremely expensive and can take a long time to find. And apparently, Sarah has a doctor that *strongly suggests* the surrogate has had a child before...but it isn't a complete requirement. This is all according to Nicole on behalf of Sarah.

Nicole and I talked about it for a long time. Nicole said she wasn't sure how she was feeling, but that she would strongly consider doing this for Sarah. She mentioned that she and Sarah feel like sisters, she's her best friend in the world, Sarah would do the same thing for her (if she could). Nicole also mentioned that she would love to experience pregnancy before we decide to have kids of our own, and said she is excited at the thought of being pregnant. 

Nicole asked me about how I'm feeling about this, and truthfully I feel weird. While I don't feel like I have a say in their business entirely, this would make a huge impact on mine and Nicole's lives for 9+ months. This could throw a wrench into our engagement/marriage plans, travel plans, etc. My girlfriend would be pregnant with her best friend's baby. I'm not even sure how surrogacy works afterward, but would she have to breastfeed it? I really have no idea. 

Plus, for completely selfish reasons, I would be living with a pregnant woman for 9 months. I know what pregnancy hormones can do to women. I know what pregnancy does to women's bodies (sort of). While this wouldn't influence me the way it will influence Nicole, it will still be hugely impactful for us. I can't imagine having Nicole do this before the two of us are ready to have a kid of our own yet, even if we won't be getting a kid out of this deal. 

So, I guess what I'm looking for here is 1) If Nicole decides to do this, what do I say? What can I do? 2) Do my opinions matter in this situation, or am I just the asshole bf here? 3) How do I talk to her about this without upsetting her, or making her feel like I don't support her?

TL;DR - Girlfriend's best friend said ""Have my baby"". I feel weird. What do I do?
