"I [26M] have from Aspergers and thought I was asexual, Ive met someone [23F] that makes me question everything. Band aid is off


original : tl;dr:Im in love for the first time in my life with my friend, Im not sure what to do as I always thought I was asexual

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lumdd/i_26m_suffer_from_aspergers_and_thought_i_was/



After a lot of thinking I decided I wanted to give it a shot. I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more. 



We were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly. 

I was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the ""love you"" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings


Instead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  ""if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out"" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face. 



I suck so I ended up blurting out ""I think Im in love with you"". yeah I realized I F up and said ""no I mean like, like you"" 


She went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to ""which is it, like or love ?"". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah .... 


So I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of. 


But she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked. 


We've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled. 


I told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me. 



 So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.


 OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early. 


   
**tl;dr**: I ended up blurting that I love her, she said she likes me back we kissed. "
"I [22M] just learned that my sister [29F] had an abortion to be able to donate me part of her liver. It caused her divorce. I can't stop hating myself.


What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery.

I never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise.

My sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him.

Apparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing.

My sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said ""she's not sure"".

I can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself.

I don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do.

Please please help me.

**tl;dr**: My sister did an abortion be able to give me part of her liver and saved my life, but it costed her marriage. "
"UPDATE: Me [36F] with my ex boyfriend [36M] of over 10 years, his wife [40F] has alienated him from all his friends and family and has started messaging me


**[Original post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4infj1/me_36f_with_my_ex_boyfriend_36m_of_over_10_years/) - tl;dr: I think my ex boyfriend is being emotionally manipulated by his wife who is alienating him from friends and family. I want to help him but don't know how.**

Hi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks!

So I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it.

Thankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family.

My husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype ""consult"". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard.

They scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home!

Bill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep.

I don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as ""personal development"" because there are still decent people in the world.

**tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**

"My [29/F] BF[32 M] ""gave"" away my Hamilton tickets, am I being selfish for just wanting to break up over this?

"UPDATE: My (19f) atheist boyfriend (21m) burped loudly during grace


First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4hndun/my_19f_atheist_boyfriend_21m_burped_loudly_during/

tldr of that was that my boyfriend burped during grace and refused to apologize.

First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to that post I made, I got a lot more responses than I thought I would! And that really made me see how in the wrong kevin was. 

Kevin and I broke up right after that incident. It made me realize a lot of things about our relationship that I guess I wasn't seeing clearly before. He really was arrogant and manipulative. He had this way of saying things that made it sound like he was right 100% of the time and that anything I said was stupid. It wasn't until after I read all of the comments that overwhelmingly said he was in the wrong that I realized just how manipulative he was. Maybe I should mention that kevin was really hot, like REALLY HOT so maybe thats why I didn't realize how much of an ass he was until way later lol.

Anyway, this isn't so much of an update as to our relationship, it's a funny story I heard. I've been working a summer job for the past while now in my hometown where both kevin and I live. It's not a tiny town where everyone knows each other but its not huge either. Anyway at work I was talking with some of my coworkers on break and the conversation of terrible exes came up. The story that my one coworker decided to share was about... you guessed it... kevin.

Apparently they dated about a year ago. my coworker (lets call her (brenda) had to go to her cousins wedding and kevin was her plus one. During the ceremony, kevin got really bored, and he decided to let everyone know. Apparently he started saying stuff like ""oh my god this is taking so long"" and ""is it almost over yet?"" and he kept going on and on. He wasn't so loud that everyone could hear him but the people around him definitely could, brenda said a lot of people were turning their heads to look at them, she was super embarrassed. Apparently they got in a huge fight between the ceremony and reception and that was the end of their relationship. LOL I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that story. Sounds exactly like something kevin would do.

Anyway thats it for my update. Things are going well for me, I'm currently enjoying single life. Just working and hanging out with friends. One of the things that kevin said that really bothered me was that religion never does anything good. That really bothered me so I started volunteering with a  charity that my church helps run once a week, just organizing stuff thats been donated. Maybe I let him get to me but it feels good to help out. I dont hold anything against atheists, you guys totally convinced me that the problem was kevin and that many atheists are cool. So thank you for that!

tldr: turns out my ex bf was a jerk in his other relationships as well. No surprise there!"
"[UPDATE] My [32F] Girl Scout Leader [32F] stole all of the cookie money.


It has been just about a month and I have an update for all of you. Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and their stories. It really helped!  [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l093t/my_32f_girl_scout_leader_32f_stole_all_of_the/)

Most of you urged me to go to the police and file a report. Well I did, but the officer that talked with me said I shouldn't file a police report yet and should contact Candie and try to procure the money from her to show that when I do file a police report I can show them that I made every attempt to get it from her and that she is aware of the theft. So, I messaged her:

""Candie, in the month of March our Girl Scouts' bank account was drained. I went to the bank and have account statements and withdrawal slips showing that you made unauthorized withdrawals from the account. If you do not restore the account I will be filing a police report on June 1st to protect myself and the girls""

Her response:

""I will be restoring it no worries. It was not all me but I will be replacing it because I am the one who lost the information. But thank you. I am putting in a certain amount each month towards both girl scouts and the bank. But thank you, I got what you are saying.""

My response:

""I spoke with the branch manager at the bank. They have evidence that it was you. I have had a bank account there for over a decade, they require you to show proper ID when you withdraw money from the account. Also, there are cameras outside and inside the building.""

Candie's response:

""Well without going into my personal information, I do not remember it, but I am being treated for it. Acknowledged my mistake and will take care of it. It will all be paid to the GS council before August 1st and the remainder of the money is accounted for between my trip to the council shop and the stuff I will be purchasing for the water park. My first payment to them is June first  because that is my first check for my new job. That is all I'm saying on any of this.""

After that, I talked with the GS council again and sent them the messages. I told them that if they didn't resolve this I would. They had a meeting about it the next day and decided to remove Candie as a volunteer (obviously) and that they would be going after her for the full amount of what they owe the Girl Scouts and what she stole from our troop. They also agreed to deposit the money right back into our account as soon as she was removed from the bank account. I was super happy about this resolution! There is a catch though... they didn't want me to tell the parents at our last meeting that this was going on. They had to officially send Candie a letter of removal before it was official. Also my contact at the GS council said they still wanted me to pass out flyers for Candie's water park event that she promised. I was pissed about that, because this lady might have a drug problem or something, how in hell can you trust that she will go buy anything for the water park or even show up? AND if she does what if she uses it as an opportunity to scam them out of more money? They had Candie drop off the troop meeting information on my porch so I didn't have to talk to her.

Well, I went to the meeting and no one ended turning up because Candie had conveniently scheduled it the day before they had the day off of school, which I wasn't aware of since I don't have a child in the school. So no one thought there was a meeting. I was actually really happy about that, because I didn't want to encourage them to go to this supposed water park event hosted by criminal Candie. 

After that, the Girl Scout Council agreed to send a representative to have a meeting with the parents and go over our options for next year and having a new troop leader. Candie sent me a message this morning (I guess one of the parents clued her in about our meeting):

""The only thing that needs to be discussed at tonight's meeting, is the fact that I will not be returning as troop leader for Troop 
xxxxxx, my family is moving and will no longer be in the school district or nearby to be able to continue with the truth. I wish you the best of luck.""


Yes, screw her for trying to cover her own ass. Even though I would love to tell everyone how terrible she is, I decided not to tell the parents about Candie. I thought about it a lot, and if I did, one of the parents will tell their daughter and then everyone will be gossiping about Candie's daughter. It is not this poor girl's fault that her step mom is a crook and I don't want her to get bullied because of it. I also think it would turn a lot of the parents away from the troop and I don't want to ruin everyone's girl scout experience because of me. Candie is gone and can't be a part of the troop anymore, so good riddance. Girl Scouts are going after her for all of the money so she will have to face the legal consequences as well. Me telling the parents wouldn't help anything.

Also, on a positive note, at the meeting one of the parents said they will step up and be troop leader, yay! I have decided to stay on and help them as much as possible. I want to have a good experience volunteering and I shouldn't give up because of one jerk. 


**edit** Just wanted to add to those that are worried that Candie can do this to another troop, she has been black listed from the Girl Scouts organization nationally, she is not allowed to be in any leadership role. As far as her doing something shady somewhere else otherwise... there's not a whole lot I can do about that. I can't let everyone in my state know she is a scumbag, so it is what it is. 
   
tl;dr: Candie was kicked out of the troop and the Girl Scouts are legally pursuing her for the money stolen from both the Girl Scouts and the troop. We're moving on! "
"UPDATE: I [23/F] don't know whether my SO [24/M] of two year's appearance-related ""preferences"" cross the line.


Link to original post here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o5d3y/i_23f_dont_know_whether_my_so_of_two_years_24m/

Putting this up top because the post might get lengthy: 
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend continually insulted my lady parts. I tried to talk to him, but he just made excuses and blamed his behavior on me, so I broke up with him.

This morning I decided to sit my boyfriend down and explain how hurtful his comments had been. He became very defensive and stated that the labia comment was meant as a compliment. Furthermore, he expressed that he thinks I'm far too sensitive, lack self confidence, and that nobody else would be bothered by his ""negging"". From the responses friends have given me when I've mentioned this (and from the comments on my previous post), I really don't think that's true. Constantly picking apart your significant other's appearance is the abnormal behavior. 

His reaction really drove home for me how selfish and insensitive the dude is. I could name numerous situations during the course of the relationship where he played the martyr, disregarding my needs and feelings entirely. 

Cases in point (All entirely true- sadly):
* He managed to break a sex toy (that he had purchased and that I hadn't even wanted to use) so forcefully that it cut me ""down there"". I got to go to urgent care bleeding from the vajayjay and he texted me saying how much it ""sucked that he hadn't gotten off"". 

*He demanded to use my laptop to play video games while on vacation, caught the charger cord with his foot while he flailed around playing World of Warcraft, and smashed it to the ground. He had a fit when I asked him to pay for the repairs and went home 10 days early (without me).

*He wore threadbare gym shorts to my grandfather's funeral and watched porn on his phone during the service.

Point being, the guy's a selfish, disrespectful jerk. I put up with it for far too long and I'm just done. Nobody's significant other should make them feel as crummy as he did me. I hope that he is able to change his behavior and find happiness in a relationship in the future. As for me, I will take my ""lady garden"" somewhere that it will be appreciated in future. Thanks to all who commented. Your kind advice helped me see what I needed to do.

"I [38M] am a sober addict. After years of not welcome me back, my family wants me back - I suspect they want money.


I started using drugs when I was 17. I was mostly into meth but I tried various drugs. My parents decided to help me but like most addicts I struggled and made their lives difficult. There were times that I embarrassed them in front of people, I stole from them and from the rest of the extended family. I did a lot of wrong.

When I was 23 they decided that they've wasted enough time and money on me so they cut me loose. It took me until I was 26 to get my act together and become clean. I went back to them when I was clean when they told me that they can't just take me back and forget about everything that I've done. They were right. I had to try to make things right.

So I stayed around but kept my distance from them. I started paying them back the money that I had stolen from them, and I paid that in full with interest within three years. That's everything that I stole from my parents and my sisters. I know it doesn't make it right but it's all that I could do. I kept sending them birthday cards and gifts, New Years cards, etc even though I wasn't with them at any of those events. Again, just trying to atone for the wrong I've done to them.

Years passed, nothing changed. My sisters married and didn't invite me to their weddings. I still sent them gifts. When my niece and nephew were born I also sent them gifts. When I married my wife they didn't come to my wedding even though I invited them. When my son was born they didn't come to see him or to his birthdays after that.

Two years ago my father had cancer. I reached out and asked if he wanted to see me and offered my support. They all declined. It took them until my father was really sick to reach out. He wanted to finally see me. I went to see him in the hospital with my son. He was very sick and was more or less ready to go. He told me then that he regrets keeping me away and wishes that he'd accepted me back sooner. We spent a whole day together. We were full of regrets but we made our peace in the end. He died a week later.

My mother and sister told me not to come to his funeral. That I didn't deserve to be there. It was hurtful since my father and I had made our peace but I respected their wishes. The funeral is for those who remain and they had the right to not want me around. I went but remained in far distance and only paid my respects when everyone else was gone. That moment was a big deal for me. I stopped trying to have my mother and sisters back. I stopped sending them gifts or cards or anything. I had tried for 10 years and I decided that it's time to move on.

We remained no contact for two years until this last weekend. My mother called me and asked if I can visit them alone. I went there and my mother and sisters were there. We talked a little. They told me that they're willing to put the past behind us and look towards the future, that's all we have is each other, things like that.

The thing is, I got the feeling that they need money and help. They kept mentioning how difficult things are for them, how my sisters are both divorced and single mothers without ""great"" careers and how they struggle to take care of their children. My mother said similar things. They kept mentioning how great I'm doing and how amazing is it that I was able to turn my life around. I totally felt like I was being manipulated. For years I would have done anything for them to accept me back and now they were tapping into those feelings. They never explicitly asked for money but their requests were implicit. They said things like ""family should take care of each other"".

So I need some advice. I'm hurt that the reason they want me back is for money. I loved them and tried for 10 years and received no forgiveness when they didn't need me but now that they need me, I'm loved and great? What should I do?
  
**tl;dr**: During my times of drug use I put my family through a lot and they eventually stopped helping me. When I became clean I tried for 10 years to atone for my mistakes and they didn't accept me. They didn't allow me to attend my father's funeral. Now they tell me that they want me back and are implicitly asking for my help. What should I do? "
"Update: I [26F] missed an important funeral and now I think my 5 year relationship with my partner [28M] might be over.


Link to my [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mi0e8/i_26f_missed_an_important_funeral_and_now_i_think/)

Original TLDR: my boyfriend can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?


I just wanted to first say thank you very much for all of your advice, it was really helpful, it made me feel like less of a terrible person and made me realise that my boyfriend is still mourning the loss of his grandmother. My SO and I had a long discussion the night I posted for advice on Reddit; and we agreed that we wanted to be together but that something needed to change in our relationship. We set some basic ground rules; we both agreed to start seeing separate therapists, him for his grief and troubles with his Dad and me for my lack of confidence and stress management. He again asked for space, so he moved out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom in our flat. I also booked a flight home for a few weeks to visit my own family, and I am set to leave in 4 days. 

We were making some good progress this week, enjoying time with each other, going to the park, just generally trying to reconnect. After sleeping in the spare bed for 5 days, he decided to move back into our room, and I was very happy about that. Up until 2 days ago I genuinely thought that we were going to make it through this. 


Things came to a head last night; I received my grades back from the school. I am very proud to say that I got an A on my research project, and one of my urban design proposals has also been nominated by my school for a Gold award from the RIBA. I am incredibly proud, this year was definitely the most difficult in my entire life and I did not expect to do as well as I actually did, I literally just wept when I get my results. 


I sent my SO a long message, letting him know how I did, and about the nomination, but more importantly thanking him for being there to support me through my degree. I told him I loved him, and that I was glad we were working together on our relationship. 


He came home that night fuming; he was so angry. He just yelled at me for basically an hour, about my lack of confidence in my own work, and about how I didn’t need to miss his grandmother’s funeral. He told me he hated me, and after that I sort of just numbed out. I don’t really remember much of what he said after that, I just stopped talking and listening. 


My final, end of year show is happening this week. It’s a huge celebration of the student’s work; I’ve filled an entire wall to exhibit my architectural work and my research results. During the end of year show a lot of people find jobs, so it’s important for us to be there to network and talk about our projects with people in the industry; I did this for my boyfriend last year when he exhibited his own work, I spent 6 hours at that event talking to different people about how amazing his work was. This morning he told me not to expect him to come tonight, because he needs to go to the gym. 


I’m flying home in 4 days, and I can tell that he just wants me to leave and never come back, which is what I am doing. I have stuck with all my promises that I made to him, I’ve supported him as best I could and I’ve begun seeing a therapist. He hasn’t even called his GP to get a referral to a therapist yet. He doesn’t want to fix our relationship; he just wants to keep me around to pay half of our rent and to use as a punching bag. 


So we’re over, I just paid my final half of the rent, and I’m moving back to my home country. I was originally only planning on returning for a few weeks, but with this ‘Brexit’ vote looking so grim I don’t really see the point in being in the UK anymore. Why return and find a job here when I will most likely be asked to leave in a year? I Like the UK, and I love my boyfriend, but it seems neither wants me so I’m going home to take care of myself. 


TLDR; Tried to use Reddit’s advice to fix my relationship, worked for just over a week.  I got my grades back and I did extremely well, my SO threw that back in my face, and is now refusing to come to my final exhibition of my work.  So we’re over, I’m moving back home, I have no plans to ever return to the UK.

"[Updated] Due to our living arrangements my older sister [26] F] has become very resentful of my sister [16 F] and I [16 F] spending time with her husband [26 M] over her. It's clearly affecting her marriage but we don't know what we can do to fix it


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m1h23/due_to_our_living_arrangements_my_older_sister_26/

Basically, our parents left for Korea two years ago to live closer to our grandparents who were both battling illnesses. They originally planned on staying in America until we graduated High School but due to worsening health conditions they decided to they weren't going to wait any longer. Our older sister stepped up to impress our parents but ended up taking on a little more than she could handle becoming very bitter and jealous toward us, borderline abusive especially with how much time we would spend with her husband.

We got quite a few PMs that were telling us that things could easily go from verbal abuse to physical abuse so we quickly started to look through our options which were basically move to Korea or try to live on our own.

After little bit of research we found out that in our state minors are legally able rent with a co-signature from an adult/parent and as long as the landlord agrees. We turned 17 on June 3rd which I think helped us out quite a bit. So we spoke with our parents about our situation, we made sure not to blame my sister but told my father that we thought it would be best that we moved out on our own to give our sister her life and husband back.

Our parents agreed and we started making calls and within the second day of looking we found a nice cheap single bedroom apartment within our dad's budget. We share a bed now anyways so it's not that big of a deal for us go with one bedroom. We moved pretty quickly through the process, we figured the sooner the better and there was a opening. Our dad flew back from Korea here to help us as soon as we were able to get all the paperwork set in stone. Even though he was extremely upset with my sister, we pleaded her case. And for first time went head to head with our dad a little bit because we understand our parents are cruel and many times unreasonable people and that our sister went through their mental abuse alone while we had each other. 

We must have said something right because he didn't scold her or anything like that. He thanked her for helping us in our time of need and watching over us for 2 years. Which is actually a lot coming from our dad. 

We did end up thanking our sister for everything and expressed how grateful we were to her. To our surprise she actually cried as we were leaving totally unexpected and told us if we needed anything to just give her a call. We wrote her note, which we gave to Frank to give to her later on, not to be overly dramatic but just because we didn't think we could really say everything we had to say in person. We wrote down everything we could possible think of that we wanted to say to her,  about her life, our lives, our parents, how we feel about her, and just some sympathy overall. Basically a big thank you, with some heart to heart. Hopefully one day we can meet back up with her as equals and repay her for her kindness but for now, were just going to do our own thing. We know it'll take more than 3 page note and a little praise from our father to fix our relationship with her but it's a start.

Our father has agreed to keep giving us money to live off of and for rent and told us to continue focusing on our future. His words were to not worry about part-time work and to just focus on school, high education and anything that will improve our college situation before we graduate high school.  We're taking the CCNA certification in a little under 4 weeks and then we'll work on getting any other smaller certifications as well as, 

We did speak with Frank who said we were very brave and mature for taking the initiative and noticing our sister's behavior. He apologized for being unable to prevent her actions and said that he would still check on us and that we were free to text and call him for anything at anytime.

We've been on our own for about 5 days now and so far everything is great.

Thanks for the advice.
 

**TL:DR:** We moved out into our own apartment, our dad came back and thanked my sister for supporting us for the two years and to check out our new place. We left a note with Frank to give to Lily hopefully to give her some perspective about how we actually feel in hopes that someday we can reconnect as sisters.

"Our [38F&amp;42] children/step children [16M&amp;16F] birthday was last week. We told our children we could not afford to buy them a car. My husband parents [60’s] have bought our daughter a car and it has put a huge strain on our family.


[removed]"
"I thought my girlfriend [25F] was cheating on me [27M] but found out something worse and need advice.


I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years and I love her so much I was planning on asking her to move in with me and marry me once I received an upcoming raise at work.

Last month or two she's been exhibiting some textbook behavior that would lead me to suspect she's cheating. I see her significantly less than normal, which she told me was due to her job. Out of paranoia I asked her coworker on Facebook about this. She told me they'd been working normal hours, nothing's changed, and that my girlfriend's attendance has actually been bad. 

Talked to her roomie/best friend of many years and she said that she has not spoken to her as much recently either and is hardly home but she thought she was with me. 

Not only that but any time I am with my girlfriend recently she'd been very protective of her phone and seemed uninterested in being around me, and very easily irritated. This isn't really like her, if anything I was always the one more easily irritated in the relationship.

She briefly mentioned someone she'd gotten back in contact with that used to be a friend in high school, so I decided to message this girl on Facebook asking if she's heard from her a lot recently or what. This girl didn't respond. 

It was really fishy so this lead me to look at her phone the next time we hung out when she was asleep. I'm not proud of it, but every time I brought anything up she was really defensive. 

I looked in her phone and there were no texts suggesting she was cheating. But instead, a lot of texts with aforementioned high school friend about popping pills together, all the new drugs she wanted to try and do, when she could get her hands on more. What hurt the most was seeing ""I don't want to talk to anyone I just want to get high"" in context of this girl asking about if I, or her roomie, knows about what she's been up to.

I don't know what to do. The only person she is talking to right now is the girl who provides her these drugs and does them with her.

I was 99.9% sure she was cheating so I only have been thinking about what I'd do given I found out she was. With this...I don't know. I want to help her, so badly. But I still feel so many things. Confusion, why would she even turn to drugs? She didn't seem unhappy. But a little betrayed that she would act like this to me. And most of all, really concerned. I love her so much and don't want to see her go down this path, a path that could really fucking harm her.
 
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 years was acting strange. I looked into it. Turns out she is not cheating but she is off doing drugs with a girl she knew in high school. I need advice on a solution as I've never dealt with anything like this before."
"Me [20M] with my friend [21F] since high school (7 years), I got a weird feeling from her texts so I called the cops. Now her mother is upset at me for what I've done and how it makes her[mother] look.


 edit: I've been messaged that I should take this down in case I need to present any more information to the police? I don't know if that's relevant? 

TL;DR; Friend's mother is making friend's hospitalization about herself and how it makes her feel. I kind of want to giver her a piece of my mind.

Unfortunately I was texting my friend yesterday when she talked about putting a knife through herself and I got worried since she has a history of self harm so I called my sheriff buddy and they took care of it. They asked for my texts, so I sent them a screenshot, and with the way she was acting and what she said they took her to the hospital. That was two days ago. 

I'm good friends with her ex, and he made the mistake (and since apologized) of giving her mother my phone number. Friend used to complain about her parents and their lack of compassion and love, and also about their abusiveness. So I knew this was probably going to be rough hearing from them. She asked me what the ""hell I was thinking"" and ""do you have any idea what you've put [me] though."" ""How does this make me look."" I'm not sorry for what I did, and it's clear the doctors felt it prudent to keep her there for the past two days. She's still not out yet. I'm glad she's getting the help she needs and deserves, rather than the ignorance and toughen up attitude her parents give her.

I feel like texting her and giving her a piece of my mind, but for now I've just ignored it. Shouldn't a parent's first priority is to keep their child safe?"
"[Updated] I [24 F] caught my fiancé [25 M] suspiciously meeting up with a younger girl [16-17 F] at our local coffee shop. He is going through great length to keep her a secret from me, calling her a family friend. I don't understand it.


[removed]"
"I [25M] received some inheritance. Family are upset that I'm not treating them to something. I already am.


My biological dad was never in my life in a meaningful way. I was raised by my mother and my step dad. My biological dad would sometimes visit and spend a day or two with me, but he was mostly married to his job and that was his number one priority. Last time I saw him was when I turned 18.

He died six months ago and I was the sole recipient of his estate since he didn't have anyone else. There were two houses, two cars, about $2m in cash and another $2m in various investments. I met a financial advisor and made plans about the investment.

I gave one of the cars to my parents. That's a 2015 Mercedes S550. My step dad always loved luxury cards so I imagined he would love this. I myself am driving a much cheaper car (my dad's other car, a 2014 Lexus IS 250). My mom and dad met because they both appreciated paintings. My mom is a collector so was my dad. I gave her his entire collection. That's worth a lot of money. Definitely much more than the Mercedes. I let my sister live in the other house rent free as long as she pays for the bills and taxes and I told her that she can live there indefinitely. The rest of the stuff are mine.

I feel like I've been fair here. However my family don't agree. They feel like I haven't been generous enough and they like more. Apparently my parents expected me to give them my dad's main house. That's the house I myself moved into. My sister expected me to give her one of the cards and transfer ownership of the other house to her rather than allowing her to live there.

I feel bad about the whole thing. I have a good family and we all love each other. I feel like I've shared enough and plan to share more as time goes by, but their expectations are too high at this point and I don't like how this whole thing is going forward. I don't know what to do or how to talk to them about everything. I'd appreciate any help.
   
**tl;dr**: I received some inheritance from my dad and shared some of it with my family. They expect more. I don't know how to approach this whole thing.

Edit: I already have a lawyer. That's really not the question."
"My mother [50F] has forced my younger brother [13M] to move out and come live with me [19F] because my older brother [23M], his wife [25F] and child [2M] are homeless. She wants to turn my brothers room into a childs room. Are we right in cutting off contact with her?


As the titles says, my mother wants my little brother to come live with me while my older brother stays with her. I feel like I need to give a little bit of backstory.

Damian has always been a trouble maker, he would always get detentions, sent out of the classroom, etc. and he seemed to take pride in it. He is a compulsive ass hole and he managed to get a girl pregnant while he was in college. He has always been the golden child and he has always received the most attention from our Mother. My younger brother and I joke around saying we may as well call Christmas Damian Day. Seriously every important holiday was made to be all about Damian. 

Damian and his wife dropped out of College and never got any type of further education. Which is fine if you have a plan but he didn’t he just dropped out because he felt like it and mom was perfectly ok with it. God forbid the day the baby was born If I or my brother even breathed around it, it was like we just spat in god himself face. (no we are not religious, just an example).

Now Damien and his wife find themselves homeless and mom has invited them to come live with her. Here comes the problem my room has since been turned into a study which mom needs for work. Damian and his wife still have their room and mom want’s to turn Nicks room (little brother) into a child’s room So she has told me and Nick that we have no choice in the matter and he is coming to live with me. 

Nick is at my place at the moment and I still attend college and I have one roommate. My roommate is babying nick and I am to in a way because we feel bad for him. Thank god I attend college in my home state/city because I don’t know what would have happened if I didn’t. He is sleeping on the couch as of now and we have no idea what to do. My mother I feel has completely lost her mind and is out of control. My dad is dead so he can’t stop her from doing this. 

Right now the arrangement is that she will sign whatever the school wants her to sign for events. Honestly I took him in gladly and my roommate Rebecca agreed to it when I told her what was happening. But are we right in cutting off all contact from them unless it is absolutely needed to talk to them?

tl:dr: Mom has forced our little brother to come live with me. ( I would gladly take him in anytime, love him to bits) because our older brother and his family are homeless. She wants to turn our little brothers room into a childs room "
"My [26/f] boyfriend [32/m] keeps getting drinks with his female friend and I just found out she doesn't know I exist.


So I posted about this before but the whole situation got worse. The summary of the previous issue is that my boyfriend kept going out for drinks (an hour or two a few times a month) with this married woman, Lucy, who I'd never met. It wasn't a huge deal and I was only mildly uncomfortable about it (because he has cheated in a past relationship - not with me) but I never mentioned it to him. Then today things got worse. 


Last night my Boyfriend mentioned Lucy again and I casually told him I'd love to meet her. He said sure, no problem. End of discussion. I figured the problem was solved.


This morning my boyfriend spent like 4 hours tidying up the apartment and basically not talking to me much (not ignoring me, just being busy with other things, no problem). Around 2 PM I asked him if he's hungry, does he want to eat lunch. He said no, he's not hungry. So I sat in the kitchen alone and ate lunch while he had a beer alone on the balcony. Ok..... fine... 

Then right after I finished eating he told me:

Boyfriend: Lucy just texted me to see if I want to get some drinks. I'm going to meet up with her. Do you mind?

Me: Um... I guess not...

(he could tell I was uncomfortable)

Boyfriend: what's wrong?

Me: I mean, I was waiting for you all morning and even ate lunch alone and then now you're leaving to go see Lucy. I don't know, it's fine, go. 

Boyfriend: Why don't you come with us?

Me: Well you are leaving now and I haven't showered yet. Does she know I exist, by the way?

Boyfriend: She knows you are a friend of mine.

Me: ...a friend? She doesn't know I'm your girlfriend?

Boyfriend: No, little by little people will know. Just come.

Me: We've been in a relationship for 2 years, dude. We LIVE together! So you've been spending time with this woman I've never met who doesn't even know you have a girlfriend? If I came with you would you introduce me to her as your friend?! as your girlfriend?!

Boyfriend: Well... as my friend. Do you want me to introduce you as my girlfriend? I will do it if you think it's the right time

Me: Woah, don't turn this around on me and make it seem like I'm forcing you to introduce me as your girlfriend. This whole thing makes me really uncomfortable. 

Boyfriend: If you want her to know you're my girlfriend, then come with me and we will tell her.

Me: Don't you realize what an awkward situation that would be for me? ""Hello I'm Jessica! I've actually been in a relationship with your friend for 2 years but you knew nothing about it! Nice to meet you!"" 

Boyfriend: It won't be awkward, come!

Me: I am not coming and I'm actually quite upset with you.



Well, he left to go meet her anyway. Once he got there, he called me and told me to come again and I said no way. Then he called again but when I picked up he immediately handed the phone to Lucy, who told me to come. It was really really awkward and I asked her to please give the phone back to [my boyfriend]. I told him this was really rude and I'm very upset now. He just kept telling me to come on over.


He's still out drinking with her right now and he's treating the whole situation like a joke. He keeps texting me ""come over!"" and jokes and stuff like it's hilarious and silly that I'm upset about this. 


Am I overreacting or is this just really uncool of him and really bad relationship etiquette?

   
**tl;dr**: I found out that my boyfriend never even told this girl that he had a girlfriend. Now he wants me to come and introduce myself as his girlfriend but I think that's super awkward. "
"Me [35M] and my wife [32F], married 12 years. 2 kids: aged 10 and 8. Wife has become vegetarian over the past few months, become very annoying about what the rest of us eat. I basically want her to be quiet and stop bothering me about it because I've had it up to here.


My wife has become vegetarian, it started gradually and she became full time vegetarian as of 5 months ago.  She did it for health reasons but mainly for moral reasons because she believes eating animals is wrong.  Fine, I don't have a problem with that.

Early on, she tried to get me to become a vegetarian and eat less meat.  I tried it, I tried her dishes many times.  Usually various indian recipes.  I hated them, I didn't like the taste of it at all.

So normally what I do is we each cook our separate meals.  She cooks hers, I cook mine.  I always cook meat with mine (I love meat) and cook fish on Fridays.

With regards to the children, I always say let them choose what they want to eat. They can eat from mine or they can eat from hers.  They more or less usually choose mine, but eat from both, although mostly mine.

She always complains that I eat too much meat. I told her too bad, I like meat. I don't police what she eats, she doesn't have the right to police what I eat.

She's tried to bring it up many times but I always shut her down because I told her I find it REALLY annoying when she keeps telling me to stop eating what I like to eat. Its my life, my body, I choose what I put in  my mouth.

The other thing is about our children.  She says they should eat the vegetarian more and wants to gradually make them vegetarian like her.  I said they're both our children, neither of us should make unilateral decisions on what they can or can't eat.  She can't forbid them from eating something without my approval, and I won't forbid them from eating something without her approval.  Nobody stops them from eating the vegetarian, its there whenever they want it.  They simply choose more often than not to eat what I'm cooking.

She doesn't like that, I say what should I do? I'm not going to tell them ""no, you can't eat this, this is only for daddy"" and eat the food they like while they hungrily look on.  And I've already said I'm not going to switch to vegetarian, its not happening, she needs to get that through her head.  She always complains about the smell or the way my food looks ""that's really revolting, its really grossing me out"".  Okay, well, I find your food revolting too?

Basically she's become very annoying about the subject because as far as I'm considered, its settled, I'm not giving up my eating habits.  I'm not shoving pieces of meat in her mouth, she shouldn't try to shove her food in my mouth.

Its become really annoying, how can I get her to just drop the issue?
   
**tl;dr**: Wife is vegetarian, kids and I are not, she's become very annoying about it and is constantly trying to force us to change even though we don't want to.

edit: post is locked for some reason, can't seem to respond to the comments.  I thought I'd add, I'm not against eating vegetables.  I love eating vegetables, I love meat too.  They go hand in hand, its not mutually exclusive. Its just that the new recipes my wife got off the internet aren't great.  In any case, if she can manage to cook up something that I find palatable, I'd be willing to eat that provided I'm allowed to still eat a side of steak or some fish or something. I can't go without meat, I end up feeling still hungry afterwards and disatisfied.   But giving up meat entirely for one day a week? That would be like me forcing her to eat a meat dish once a week.  Its never ever ever happening, I can say now I'd sooner divorce before that happens.

I'll speak to her about getting a marriage counsellor see how she responds.  But hell will freeze over before I give up meat, even if its for one day a week.

As for our kids, they are getting older.  They are gonna be making more decisions. I doubt she'll be able to try to police their eating when they are 16 or 18."
"Update: I am (25F), my husband (25M) refuses to compromise on the order of our sex acts 3x a month.



Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mxcdl/i_am_25f_my_husband_25m_refuses_to_compromise_on/




I'm going to apologize in advance, this may be an unsatisfactory update after I went into so much detail last time. I really struggled writing it. I severely underestimated how painful and embarrassing it would feel seeing everyone discussing my life. I debated whether or not to update at all but this sub has been an incredible resource, even secondhand, for me throughout my life and I owe you that much.

  

I would like to clarify that I misspoke when I implied my husband was the only one who wanted to start trying to have kids. We mutually expressed interest in possibly conceiving before we were married, he didn't want them outside of wedlock, a wedding was his condition to have a serious discussion about it. I should have said something like ""Now that we're *both* ready to start trying"".


  
My husband and I had a very long conversation. The gist of it was that he's had issues with resenting women for perceived slights for a long time. He swears that he hasn't had those thoughts or urges towards me since early in our relationship when he realized I would not be ""cruel or withholding"" towards him. He said he tried not to think about debasing other women when we were together, but found it difficult when I wanted rougher play or was in a position where he couldn't see my face. He seemed confused that I'm not okay knowing he thinks those things about anyone.

  

He said that'd he'd been making a lot of progress but had been ""triggered"" by an incident at his bachelor party. Since then he'd been struggling with intense levels of those thoughts and urges again. He said he knew it was wrong to marry me without coming clean but only felt a tremendous amount of guilt about lying through omission once we were trying to have a child.


  
He said when I confronted him about improving our chances he felt backed into a corner and was ""lashing out"". He told me he didn't believe the things he said to/about me, but did with regards to other women.


  
At some points I felt like he was trying to lead me to the conclusion that his father's overreaction to an incident of ""youthful curiosity"" led to him associating predatory urges with sexual desires. I did not feel equipped to delve into that but it really smelled like bullshit to me.


  
Ultimately I decided that anything he said was irrelevant, my primary problem was that I could no longer trust *myself* to trust him. I also have been unable to envision having sex with him in the future. I'm unable to even remember feeling loved and safe while being intimate with him without feeling humiliated and disgusted. 


  
I told him things of that nature and he just completely deflated and broke down. I felt very detached, almost like I suspected he was crying out of self-pity. I don't know if my feelings were truly warranted.


  
I told him all I could agree to was holding off on making a decision on whether or not to attempt moving forward in the relationship. I wanted no contact while we both went to therapy for six months. After six months I would have a discussion with him and his therapist and see how I felt then. He was very unhappy but agreed.


  
After he left he went to his parent's house and had an unbelievable altercation with his family. He physically attacked his elderly father and did not stop until his thirteen year old sister beat him repeatedly with a baseball bat, to the point he lost consciousness. She said she hit him ""A lot. Like, I knew it was too much but he wouldn't stop.""


  
A lot of disturbing stuff came to light as a result in the wake of that. The incident of ""youthful curiosity"" was severely underplayed and was not the only incident. Then I found out that even though he told me he'd never tried therapy his parents and a few relatives had paid for SIX years of it.



His parents expressed deep shame that they gave us their blessing to wed. They not only revoked it, they offered me his share of inheritance to pay for a future wedding to someone else. 



I'm crazy about my in-laws and absolutely believe their version of this situation over his. I don't accept physical violence was an acceptable response to ANYTHING my FIL could have said, let alone what everyone agrees was said. I also feel like a lot of things my husband told me during our initial discussion were faerie truths.


  

Based on my FIL's shockingly uncharacteristic anger and shame towards his son I believe I still don't have the full picture of my husband's issues but I've seen enough. I'm acjhing for them, they have five other incredible and  wonderful children, I don't really understand what happened with my husband.


  
Ultimately I believe my husband can overcome his issues but I don't feel he wants to change for himself. I'm not interested in being his prize for being a decent person.


  
I'm still planning on getting into therapy before anyone asks. Not only has this has really fucked me up but something must have been wrong before for me to get taken in like this. 


   
**tl;dr**: update: I am divorcing him. "
"My (21f) bestfriend's (23f) makeup is so bad that I'm worried it will impact the start of her career.


I love my best friend; she's a beautiful intelligent girl who has a lot of potential. Both she and I are working on becoming teachers, but she has just graduated and is now looking for a job. I have no doubts that she will be an excellent teacher, but I am worried that how she wears her makeup will keep her from getting a lot of jobs because it is so unprofessional.

My best friend has always been very into makeup, but she isn't good at it, she just buys and wears a lot of it. It's not a difference of style, it's just that she's really, really bad at executing what I think she's going for. 


She regularly wears foundation that is several shades to dark for her and it's noticeable in comparison to her to the skin surrounding her face. She wears so much foundation that it isn't uncommon for her to go through a whole container of foundation in one week. For people who use foundation, you know how ridiculous that is. She applies upwards of 10 layers of mascara until it becomes kinky and clumped and she wears very bright, noticeable blush. This is her everyday makeup. She's been getting more into lipstick lately, but she often chooses very bold colors and so jagged application is very noticeable. One day I met up with her and I noticed she had dirt on her face so I helped her rub it off---except it wasn't dirt, it was bronzer, but looked indistinguishable from someone accidentally rubbing some dirt on their face.


I don't think I'm just being hypercritical of her makeup job, *many* of her close friends and SO's have warned her about it, but this is how she likes it. Upon meeting Her last ex's mom, the mom didn't realize that was her look and tried to wipe some of her foundation off because she thought she accidentally put too much on and didn't blend it right. 

I've tried to nicely state that her foundation isn't the right shade or that she doesn't need to put as much of everything on as she does, but she likes it how she does it.


The real problem is that her ""toning down"" her makeup is reverting to her everyday style as described above. 



She is wearing this kind of makeup to job interviews and has not had any success despite the fact she is in other ways well qualified and certified to teach a subject that is in high-demand.





I'm not sure the best way to help her understand that her makeup is really unprofessional and will likely be something that prevents her from being hired. I have told her she should take it easy on the makeup when she goes in for interviews, but she will send me a snapchat before she goes with a ridiculous amount of layers of poorly applied makeup.



Does anyone have advice?



**tl;dr:** Best friend wears way too much mismatched, poorly applied makeup. She is going into teaching and has been turned away after several interviews already. I think that her makeup may have an impact on her not being hired.

"Me [22 F] with my boyfriend of six months [25 M] told me I needed to get a boob job after we had sex


[deleted]"
"My(24f) college bf(24m) broke up with me when I took in my orphaned brothers(5/8). I am now dating someone new(35m) and my friends can't accept this.. How can I handle this?


When I was 22, I was a typical 22 year old. I was finishing up my degree, getting ready for grad school, enjoying life, and deliriously in love with Jamie- my high school sweetheart. Jamie was the perfect boyfriend and my friends all openly envied our relationship. Jamie and I had looked at engagement rings and were planning a life together.

However, when my father and stepmother died-everything changed. I was a mess. And my two little brothers were orphans. They were three and five, so little, and so sad. The only other options to take them in were strangers, people they didn't know.  Long story short, Jamie and I broke up and I am raising my brothers. 

We tried to stay friends, but it didn't work because neither of us could forgive the other for ""ruining us"". However, I now look back and don't bear him any ill will. I feel like he was part of another life and wouldn't fit in this one.

That's been about two years. I feel like I get this new life now and I like it. I love the boys and I feel like I'm doing ok at this- they're happy and healthy. I've even started dating again.

His name is not David, but lets call him that anyways. David was a family friend, extremely close to my dad, and has offered so much help and assistance. He even helped make arrangements for the funeral. Yes, he is 35. But we grew close and I deeply enjoy his company. We've started dating and honestly we're having a great time. He is witty and handsome and fits. He doesn't do big-romantic-movie gestures. He does the real little things and those matter to me.

That's where the drama has entered. A little before me and David made things official (but after our presence had been hinting at it, through pictures on social media, going certain places together) Jamie came back in the picture. He said that he was older now and more mature, that he regretted it all, etc.

I turned him down. He was not obligated to stay with me and I don't blame him for not being ready to take on it all, but the fact that he left means he's not the right man for me. He was upset and hurt. I feel a little bad but at the same time, he broke up with me after the death of my dad, when I had two little boys who were devastated and didn't quite get mommy and daddy weren't coming home.. I don't blame him- you can't live your life for other people, break ups hurt.

Here's the real kicker-my friends can't quite ""get"" that I chose David over Jamie.  That I am in like with David and happy...

My best friend Alexis in particular. She keeps saying things like ""Jamie was perfect"" ""Jamie loves you so much"" ""Remember when Jamie-"" and inserting cheesy stories of nice things Jamie did in college or high school.

I feel like this image they have of me and Jamie needs to fade. David and I threw a bbq this weekend. Alexis came, along with lots of other friends from college. She even mentioned that ""we should've invited Jamie- that would have been so much fun!"" And bringing up small stories of Jamie and how ""awesome"" he was.

Meanwhile, David was charming and wonderful, a great host who ignored her comments. I apologized afterwards and said she would not be over until I talked to her. He smiled and said it was fine. But I don't think it is ok for my friend to disrespect this wonderful person that way.

I brought it up and she disregarded it. ""Jamie was all of our friend- he still is my friend- and I was just talking"". Then when I pressed her, she eventually conceded ""I just feel like you gave up your great love to raise your brothers and that's not fair"".  How can I get her to respect my new relationship?


tl;dr My(24f) college bf(24m) broke up with me when I took in my orphaned brothers(5/8). I am now dating someone new(35m) and my friends can't accept this, my best friend in particular.. How can I handle this?"
"My fiancé [25 M] lied about speaking Korean fluently to me [24 F] for 3 years. I don't know what to think.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nb40d/my_fiancé_25_m_lied_about_speaking_korean/


First I want to say that I admit I was totally wrong for trying to make this about me, and I realize my parents and friends  as well as myself were all horrible people which I agree with.

I spoke with Jimmy same day I posted the thread, I actually invited him over to my parent's place for dinner but before that I stopped by his parent's house to apologize to him, his dad and his younger sister for everything because I felt so embarrassed and horrible. I apologized profusely to his dad, who did nothing but laugh.

His dad was beyond understanding and actually spoke Korean quite well himself, he actually laughed saying that he understands why my parents were the way they are. He even told me about the story of when he first met Jimmy's mom's parents in Korea and how much she warned him about their behavior. He said that she explained it to him and he understood and was able to respect where their concerns were coming from in terms of wanting to preserve their language and all heritage

He told me it started off rocky, but they shut up so fast when he surprised them and spoke it fluently. He said his relationship with her parents now stronger than ever especially since she past away and he calls them twice a week just to chat. He said that when he heard that I stuck up for Jimmy he was proud of me even though he never said anything.

Jimmy's sister she's only 12 but is super sweet and mature for her age, she said that when Jimmy started dating me was the day he started teaching and talking to her in Korean again, it was really precious the way she described it. His dad teaches/talks her as well but she really likes when Jimmy does it.


As for Jimmy and I we been working together to resolve our communication issues and we've spent a lot of time talking all about us. 

I admitted all my concerns and he addressed them one by one and told me exactly what I needed to hear. He apologized for keeping it from me for so long and told me that he didn't do it maliciously. 

He just didn't want to associate Korean with the negativity that my parents and friends brought. Which I find is extremely understandable. He said he regarded the language as something pure that him and his mother often shared together, that he didn't want to engage in with my parents and friends. He admitted that it probably sounded silly, but I understood him on an emotional level. 

He told me about how close him and his mom were (We had never talked this in-depth about it before) and I cried like a little baby because I could tell how much he loved and missed her. 

He told me that she always teased/warned him about the complications of marrying a full blood Korean while he was a teenager and he didn't truly understand until he met my parents and friends. I even found out that Jimmy was born and lived in Korea for 12 years. 

I feel like our relationship is stronger as ever, my doubts and worries are gone and we're going to be a lot more open with one another. I'm ashamed I ever tried to doubt him. He has been speaking Korean to me a lot more exclusively since I've apologized to him. 

Most probably won't understand but he took me to see his mother's grave and it was probably one of the most touching moment I've ever had with him. I kneeling beside him listening as he told her about me basically how he knew he had found the person he would make new memories with and how he would have to go back on a promise. I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life, I couldn't even stop. 

We had dinner with my parents on Tuesday and Jimmy spoke to them in Korean for the first time and my parents apologized for their tongue. 

I think I didn't make it as clear as I should in my original post but after I defended him they cut back significantly. 

Jimmy apologized for their years of disappointment teasing them for their original concerns. He told them a little about his mom and when he told them his mother's maiden name my father's eyes lit up. He didn't really go into detail but he think he might have known of her family. It made him extremely chatty and open, I've never seen my father so excited to talk to someone before in my life.

Jimmy also brought up that his family are planning a trip to Korea this Summer and he offered to pay for all of us to come with them. My parents haven't been back in years and they happily accepted his offered. 

Jimmy is wonderful really, I'm lucky to have him and I'll never let him go.

Thanks for the advice.

**EDIT: Jimmy's apology to my parents for years of disappointment was in a joking manner, not something sincere. It was meant as a joke and everyone laughed about it. Sort of like breaking ice or easing the tension in the room**

**TL;DR:** Apologized to Jimmy and his dad and sister. Learned about Jimmy's mother and a bit about his past. He's decided to speak Korean more. He forgave my parents and even is offering to bring them to Korea with his dad and sister near the end of the summer. All around everything worked out perfectly."

"I [23/F] don't know whether my SO of two year's [24/M] appearance-related ""preferences"" cross the line.


I'm looking for a little unbiased advice and am hoping this might be the place to get it. Throughout our relationship, my SO has always been very detailed and specific in expressing his preferences regarding my appearance. I guess I'm fairly defensive when it comes to appearance-related criticism and I don't know if I'm just too sensitive and need to compromise or if his requests are a bit excessive.

SO has made a number of sort of cutting, backhanded compliment type comments over the years. Along the lines of ""Your lady parts aren't my usual type, but because it's you I can handle it."" I've talked to him about it and he doesn't seem to have a good explanation for this behavior, but agreed to try to stop. 

My privates are the most frequent subject of contention. He has stated that he prefers ""smooth, tight vaginas with minimal wrinkling"" which apparently doesn't describe mine. There's very little I can do about that, so his comment naturally made me feel a bit self-conscious, especially regarding future intimacy. I also don't completely shave down there, which he absolutely hates. I have extremely sensitive skin, in general, and I find that shaving or waxing especially intimate areas just isn't tolerable. I've seen other posts where women described similar issues, so it can't be all that uncommon. SO is entitled to his preference, of course, but having to hear his complaints every other day just gets really old. He even researched laser hair removal, which I had to explain that I just cannot afford at this time. 

SO also complains about the length of my hair. It is about shoulder length, which I find to be flattering and easy to style. SO wishes it was much longer and has pointed out that I wore my hair very long when I was a young teenager. I attempted to explain that people change their hairstyles and that I no longer like wearing my hair very long or have time in the mornings to style a mass of thick, bum-length hair. His response was: ""It doesn't even have to be very long- just long enough to cover your nipples.""

I'm at my wit's end trying to accommodate his preferences and I am beginning to wonder whether we are simply incompatible and I might be better off ending things.

   
**tl;dr**: How much should you reasonably be expected to change about your appearance to please a partner?

EDIT: Wow, I'm blown away by how much attention this has gotten! I'm adding a couple of pieces of information here that lots of people have asked about. Yes, SO is very into porn and has been from a very young age. The only other actual relationships he has had were when he was 14 and 16, respectively, so he doesn't have a lot of experience with adult women's vaginas/labia/pubic hair, etc. in real life. "
"I(27M)found a locked folder filled with pictures of me on my wife(23F)'s laptop. Do I just ignore it?


So my wife and I have been together 4 years, married for 1. Recently she has gone to visit family members living in another country and I couldn't go with her due to my job. She has been gone for two weeks now and will be back on friday. About three days ago she asked me to send her pictures of our daughter stored in her laptop as she wanted to show them to family members. So I went to get the folder but among the many folders there was one that was locked. I know it was wrong of me, I shouldn't have snooped and I violated her privacy. I didn't even believe I could get her password right but I did (she tends to use really obvious ones like a combinaison of my and our daughter's birth dates so it wasn't that hard). Turned out the folder was filled with pictures of me, hundred of them. Pictures I knew were being taken and more candid ones like me sleeping or being busy. What I don't understand is why she would lock this folder? I could understand if she wanted to protect my privacy by locking that folder but there are other family pictures in folders that are not locked. There are also no intimate pictures of me.

I spoke about it with my brother but he didn't take it seriously and kept making jokes about how my wife was a hitman and I should be careful. If she had just a folder filled with pictures of me I could somehow understand, but that folder was *locked*. She knows it doesn't bother me that she likes taking pictures of me so why lock it? My question is, do I just forget I found this folder or do I ask her about it knowing she will get upset over me snooping? Is is it worth it? Does anyone have any idea why she would do that? I know this issue is not really that important in the grand scheme of things but I was wondering if it was worth potentially starting an argument.



   
**tl;dr**: My wife has a locked folder on her laptop filled with hundreds of pictures of me. I found it by snooping. Do I ask her about it or do I just let it go?

Edit: Thank you all for the different insights. I have finally decided to just pretend I don't know about that folder as it is most likely harmless and I actually feel really flattered."
"My BF's of one year [31] friend [25] ""gifted"" him and married friend [31] prostitutes. Was I wrong for telling the friend's GF?


My boyfriend and two of his friends (Karl and Jasper) went on a trip to mexico. While there his friend Karl decided to ""gift"" my boyfriend and Jasper prostitutes. My boyfriend felt ""obligated"" to sleep with her and did. But this post isn't about what my boyfriend did or what I'm going to do about it. That's something I'm trying to figure out myself in therapy. 


So some backstory on Karl and Jasper. They're both pretty shitty people. Jasper is married but he and his wife are swingers. Cool, none of my business. However, before they got married Jasper had a year long affair with one of his wife's enemies. She found out about a separate affair a couple months before their wedding but decided to stay. She still doesn't know about the affair with her enemy. My understanding is that they are very happy together, are polyamorous and have a third, and are in the process of trying to buy a house and get pregnant. Jasper's wife gave him a free pass to do whatever he wanted this vacation. 

Karl on the other hand has been cheating on his GF since day one. He crashed with my boyfriend a couple of nights when he came to town and brought home a girl (not his gf) and had sex with her. He says he did it because his gf was just starting fights out of nowhere, he was only staying with her because she was watching his house and dog while he was out of town, and that he was going to break up with her as soon as he got back home. That was 8 months ago and they are still together, he's still cheating every chance that he gets. He planned this mexico trip as a vacation to screw as many girls as he could. I met his gf once and once there was a face to the cheating I started feeling guilty. However, out of ""loyalty"" to my boyfriend, I kept my mouth shut. 


So after I find out about the cheating, I tell my boyfriend that I no longer feel any sense of loyalty to his friendship with Karl and I was going to tell his GF about everything that I know. He asked me not to not because of his relationship with Karl but because Karl's GF knows about the affair with Jasper's wife's enemy. Jasper is my boyfriend's best friend and my boyfriend would get blamed for the end of his marriage. I told him I was probably going to do it anyways, if Jasper didn't want his marriage to end he shouldn't have done what he did. I told the GF and everything blows up. Karl's GF reaches out to Jasper's wife and tells her everything. The Karl and Jasper are attempting to point fingers at anybody but themselves. 


My boyfriend is incredibly angry at me and told me that I just ruined his friendship with Jasper and ended Jasper's marriage. All out of spite. My boyfriend told me that I'm an evil person for ending two other relationships because I'm upset with my own.  I tell him I don't feel guilty at all. It's not like I'm making up lies. My boyfriend, Karl, and Jasper's behavior is what is ending their relationships. 



After typing all this out I realize that it's just all a fucked up situation. I know what you all are goign to say. ""Birds of a feather flock together."" All three of them are bad eggs and throw all of them out. But I'm starting to feel a little guilty about Jasper and his marriage so I wanted to get some outside opinion. Was I wrong in telling Karl's girlfriend what I knew?


   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend and his friend slept with prostitutes. Shit blew up when I told friend's gf. Was I wrong?"
"Update: Me [18m], I found out one of my friends [18M] had been cheating on his girlfriend, now no-one believes me and I've been cut out from things till I apologise.


Update to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ooxzu/me_18m_i_found_out_one_of_my_friends_18m_had_been/

Thanks to the few who helped me in the first post and made me see things clearer. I would like to point out that I don't see the majority of my friends who didn't believe my story as ""bad people"" as Gavin is a very good liar and the only evidence I had was a drunk conversation, also I'm not a big fan of Gavin in the first place so most of them were thinking I was getting revenge.

So back to Sixth Form yesterday this story got a whole lot more interesting. It was awkward between me and my friends as Gavin and me weren't speaking (he's a bit of a keyboard warrior so he didn't say anything to my face), till someone brought it up and said I should apologise. I refused too, and told them I was telling the truth, I'm not apologising etc. This is when it developed into a full on argument with a few people siding with me (more so than when it was first revealed) as they said I seemed legit, a few people trying to calm down the situation and a few people siding with Gavin. When our lessons started we just went separate ways and except the people I'm in classes with, I never saw any of them till later in the day.

Well it all blew up as I see Hannah shouting at Gavin saying he's dumped, me and my friends who are there rush over whilst he's still trying to say it was Liam not him. Liam, being the little stooge he is tried to convince Hannah of the story again, but apparently she had proof this time it was Gavin. She saw me and sincerely apologised to me as I was telling the truth.

The story spread around fast as you can imagine. I got a few texts off my friends/some in person to say how sorry they were for not believing me and they didn't think Gavin was like that. So the people who have made the effort with me, I'll accept their apologies. However the people that haven't reached out, can go fuck themselves along with Gavin and Liam.


   
**tl;dr**: IT caused tension at Sixth Form, until Hannah found proof that Gavin was in fact cheating and that I was telling the truth. Most of my friends apologised, a few of them haven't so they as well as Gavin and Liam can fuck off."

"My [24F] sister [16F] woke up to see our step brother [17M] in her room. Parents say she dreamed. She swears she didn't.


So we're in this family mess right now.

Two nights ago woke up at night and saw our step brother (our dad married his mom) in her room standing over her. When he noticed that she's woken up he ran away. She went after him and woke up the parents and he played dumb and pretended to be asleep. To make it short, they didn't believe my sister. They said that it was a dream and she imagined it. My sister is 100% sure that it wasn't a dream. She's staying with me now.

So our parents are upset that she accused our step brother of that creepy behavior and want her to apologize to him and sort things out, she's sure that it all happened. My sister says she doesn't want to be alone with him anymore and she wants to lock her door at night, parents don't agree. Sister says that unless parents agree to that she's not going to come back home.

So I'm here right in the middle of this. Parents want me to bring her back. My sister wants me to take her side and protect her. I know I'm not going to kick her out of my flat. She can stay here if she wants to. She actually suggested that she'd rather move in with me permanently.

I want my sister to both be safe and feel safe. Even if she dreamed that moment, she believes it was real and living in fear isn't good for her. I know she's not making it up. I also know that my step brother is a nice kid but I know kids that seem nice can indeed do creepy things so I'm not blinded by it.

So what should we do? My sister is looking at me for direction here. Should I push my parents to allow her to live with me or push with the lock, or something else? 

   
**tl;dr**: sister woke up to see step brother in her room. Parents don't believe her and say she dreamed. She's staying with me now. Parents want her back but refuse to allow her to have a lock on her door or not be alone with step brother. She's looking at me for direction, what should I do?"

"I broke up with her: My girlfriend [23F] is raging angry because I [23M] slept with someone else when I thought we were broken up.


Okay so this is a quick update post to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mczd5/my_girlfriend_23f_is_raging_angry_because_i_23m/ post I made.

tldr of old post: tl;dr: Girlfriend broke up with me, I slept with someone else, she said she didn't ""really"" break up with me, she was just angry. Is angry at me and calling me a cheater.

Update:

I decided to permanently and formally end things with her, this time the break up is permanent and clear on all sides.  I decided to do it for a number of reasons

* Her asking that I cut contact with my friends.  While I think this was a fair respect from her point of view given what happened, I would not be able to hold myself to it.

* I think we both want different things for our long term and short term futures, for example she wants marriage sooner rather than later, whereas for me its more of a 'maybe' thing for maybe when I'm in my 30's.

* Most of all, I felt our relationship had run its course.  Yes we were together a very long time, 8 years, but I've come to the realisation that I was still in that relationship only because of a sense of familiarity, not because I actually wanted to be in that relationship.  I feel the love had fizzled out and I was no longer in love with her.  I think the relationship had been dying for a while and I was just afraid to admit that.  The fact that I slept with someone else so soon is evidence of that.

It wasn't easy, she didn't take it well, I don't blame her, 8 years.  There were lots of tears, but I'm sure she'll get over it. Life goes on.

"I [21 F] woke up at 2:30 am to my boyfriend [21 M] groping and attempting to finger me while I was asleep. He claims he was asleep... Not sure how to proceed.


Hello, Reddit. Weirdest morning/night of my life... 

I just started dating this guy a couple weeks ago. He's great! Attentive, caring, smart, funny, sweet, put together, and sexy as hell, basically everything I've ever wanted. We've slept in the same bed together before  (maybe 5 times) and nothing like this has ever happened.

Last night, before we fell asleep, he was doing normal boyfriend things and groping me and kissing me. I wasn't really in the mood, but didn't know how to verbalize it, so I moved his hand away and shifted into a more cuddle-friendly (not grope-friendly) position. He kissed my shoulder and said, ""you can tell me no, you know, I'll listen."" I turned and kissed him and told him I was really tired and not in the mood, but maybe tomorrow morning if he had time before work. He kissed me back, said that was perfectly okay and shifted around a bit to get into a more comfortable sleeping position. He sleeps naked, I sleep in panties. 

That was around midnight. Fast forward to 2:30... I'm fading in and out of sleep, thinking I'm having a sex dream, because it felt like he was groping me and thrusting against me. Then I felt a hand go into my panties. At that point, I'm wide awake wondering what the fuck is going on. His hands change from holding my hips and thrusting against my ass (couldn't tell if there was an erection or not, was too shocked), and slipping into my panties and kind of gliding along my vulva/slightly entering my vagina. His other hand is groping my boobs. Thinking he's trying to initiate sex, I take his hand that's on my hips and move it back. It immediately goes back to its position and then goes for my panties. I lifted his hand one last time and the same thing happened. Due to past sexual assault trauma (which I have told him about), I froze, feeling terrified and very vulnerable. So now I'm staring at the wall, frozen, while my boyfriend attempts to finger me and is giving me a friction rash on my ass from his pubic hair and shit rubbing up against it so forcefully and often. I lay still for a couple minutes. He's not saying anything and it's pitch black dark. I finally get the courage to get out of bed to pee. He doesn't seem phased and rolls over. 

I pee and try to figure out what the fuck just happened. Why was he doing that when I was asleep, did he know that I was asleep? Why didn't he listen when I moved his hand back? He didn't say anything, Is he asleep? What the fuck is going on... So I washed my face and went back to bed. He rolled back over to spoon me and placed his hands on my hips again. They started to slide down and, thinking he was going for my panties again, I moved his hand back. He made a weird sigh/grunt and rolled back over. I sat there wondering wtf just happened. 

We woke up before he had to go to work and I asked him ""what do you remember about last night?"" he looked very confused. So I explained everything and he claimed he doesn't remember anything except me coming back to bed and not wanting to cuddle. Okay... 

When I told him, he took it pretty hard. He actually stayed long enough to be significantly late for work and even cried once, saying he didn't know what the fuck happened, but he didn't ever want to lose me or hurt me. He also said that when I told him about the sexual assault, all he wanted to do was make it better, but not he feels like he's the cause of my pain. I told him I need to process this and he left for work. 

So... What the fuck? I know people can have sex in their sleep but... What the fuck? I feel very violated but at the same time, he genuinely did not seem to remember what happened. I don't know what to think or feel. It's bringing up a lot of unwanted memories and makes me feel confused. How do I approach this? Is this even a thing? He seemed genuinely confused and I don't want to penalize the guy for something he did in his sleep. He used to live with his ex for a whole year (sleeping in the same bed) and he said she never mentioned anything like that.

TL;DR: new boyfriend groped, humped, and attempted to finger me in my sleep. He says he doesn't remember it and seems genuinely upset about what happened. I don't know how to feel or how to approach this... Help? "
"I [22F] want to cut off my sister [24F] after she admitted to selling my dog for drug money


My sister Luna has gone to AA and drug rehab in the past year. We are all in our twenties. Luna is [24F] and I am [22F]. We have a brother Daniel [26M] who I am close with but doesn't talk to Luna at all. 

I was supportive of Luna up until this past week. I went to a meeting with her, instead of my Mom [45F] who normally goes. I was introduced to the group and the meeting was about forgiving and honesty. During this meeting, Luna told me a few things I didn't know. 

- She stole $500 from me, which I thought was my boyfriend. I ended up breaking up with that guy over it. She said she would pay me back for the money.
- She sold my dog for drug money. The dog I thought ran away because someone left the gate open. 
- She has ""borrowed"" items and never brought them back. 

I sat there stunned because this happened within the last three years. She only recently hit rock bottom when my parents kicked her out for stealing my Mom's wedding ring. So I am not shocked. 

I have not lived at home for three years, and the dog disappeared right before I was going to move. 

I left the meeting. I have gotten calls from my sister telling me she is sorry, she didn't mean for it to happen. I told my Mom what happened and she has told Luna she needs to pay me back for the cost of everything and also replace the dog. 

Total, Luna would owe me about $4000 and I want her to pay me back for what she took. Luna said she wants forgiveness and she doesn't have the money, but she will try to. I told her I didn't know if her paying me back would make me want to have her in my life. 

I tried to be supportive, but she has caused so much pain and suffering. She let me break up with someone over the money, saying she saw him take it. I should have been smarter, but I never thought my sister would take the money from me or sell my dog to someone for drugs/alcohol. 

I am thinking of cutting her off and no longer having her in my life. 

Luna brought a puppy to my apartment, gave me the $500 and said she would make up the rest. The puppy is not the same breed as the other dog, but it's cute. I took the puppy but told her that it doesn't mean I am going to forgive her. 

Am I overreacting? I feel furious thinking about this. I called up my ex and apologized, but he told me that he didn't want to talk to me again. I told him I understood and there are no hard feelings. We have been broken up for about a year now and I have a new boyfriend. I have no interest in rekindling a relationship. But I do think that what Luna did crossed lines .

What do I do? 

**TL;DR** SIster admitted to selling my stuff/dog/stealing money during her drug days. "
"Updates My (34f) neighbor (30-40s?F) is accusing my lawn guy (16m) of being a peeping tom.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4onqyd/my_34f_neighbor_3040sf_is_accusing_my_lawn_guy/

I don't know if I linked the original correctly, but here's the update as it stands. And I want to thank everyone for their comments. I've tried reading them all and commenting when I can, but I've been running around doing last minute wedding stuff today. So...

I have just gotten off the phone with Officer X, the officer that left the door hanger yesterday. This is the gist of what's going on. Sheila is my neighbor.

- Sheila called the police department yesterday around 4:00 (so when I got home) to report a loose/aggressive dog. There is a leash law in my town.

- Officer X and his partner arrived around 4:10/4:15 and took Sheila's statement. She said my dog (I have two) was running around the neighborhood and attacked her when she got out of her car.

- Officer X came over to ask me about the incident, experienced the super excessive barking first hand, and left a note when I didn't answer the door.

- Officer X told Sheila that he left a note asking me to contact him on Monday, his next work day. Sheila was NOT happy about this. She was basically demanding that someone do something immediately about my ""dangerous breed dog"". My dogs are miniature Schnauzers. They weight approximately 12 and 15 lbs.

- Officer X told Sheila that there was no way to corroborate the incident since my dogs were both inside my house, not outside as she claimed. Sheila apparently said that the city police department is awful because twice she's reported crimes and nothing had been done.

- I filled Officer X in on what happened Wednesday when Daniel was here and about the conversation I had with Sheila on Thursday. Officer X said dispatch had notified him when he got the call Friday that the same individual had made a call Wednesday, was told it was a non issue, Sheila became ""disgruntled"". Apparently they keep tabs on callers in the event that they are just nosy neighbors.

- Officer X asked if my dogs are ever allowed to be out without being leashed. I told him we have an underground fence and the dogs are inside 99% of the time when they are home (they go to doggy daycare three times a week and we take them to our massive family farm at least twice a week). The only time the dogs are outside unleashed is when they are within our fencing to either relieve themselves (we have to let them out) or getting in and out of the vehicles. 

- I explained that there was no way either of my dogs were the loose dog (if there even was one) because they had been at doggy daycare until 3:50 and we live roughly 5 minutes from the daycare. I told him I will be glad to get a receipt from them Monday and he suggested I do so.

- Officer X also suggested I do two things. The first was to tell Daniel's parents about the incidents on Wednesday and Thursday. His reasoning was, with it being a small neighborhood, Sheila might ""share the story"" with the homes around her and it might come back negatively on Daniel. Since Daniel's father grew up in the neighborhood, the neighbors are familiar with him and likely to side with him rather than believe me (someone they don't really know) if Sheila has already told them her version of events. The second was to write up a letter to Sheila telling her that she is to stay off of our property and to cease any contact with us. Officer X said he would deliver it to her himself Monday, since I'm going to allow him access to my home to check the fencing situation and the laundry look out.

So it wasn't about Daniel, but Sheila did call to report the incident on Wednesday and was told out was a non issue. Why she still attempted to further the issue with me, I've no idea. My partner and I are getting married Friday and will be gone for the weekend, so I am going to have friends come by several times during those days to make sure everything is okay and she hasn't burned my house down or something (because she's clearly unstable).

I am going to tell Daniel's parents tomorrow afternoon before he gets back and give them all of the information (what happened, Thursday's incident, Friday's incident, and what Officer X suggested they do) and I'm going to make sure I'm home the entire time Daniel is working from now on.

TL;DR:

Sheila tried to get me in trouble for someone else's/a stray dog being unleashed and attacking her. The officer was not aware of what happened Wednesday, but was notified by his dispatch that she had made a call that day. The officer suggested I tell Daniel's parents and let them handle the neighbors since dad grew up there. Officer is coming Monday to check out the dog situation/the laundry room and will deliver a no contact letter to Sheila from us.

Sheila is clearly unstable and since I am getting married next weekend, I am having a few friends ride by and check things out at my house periodically those three days.

"Update: My boyfriend (45M) uses racial slurs during sex with me (32F) and I'm not sure what to do about it.


[original!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o0ivk/my_boyfriend_45m_uses_racial_slurs_during_sex/)

Hello everyone. First off, I want to say how completely overwhelmed I was by the amount of people who commented on my post. I honestly did not think it would get so many replies and upvotes and I am eternally grateful for the people that replied to me and gave me advice, helpful tips, or told me to get off my ass and leave this asshole. I want to thank each and every one of you for being so wonderful. Onto the update:

Since my (now ex) boyfriend was on a business trip, I moved my things out and moved back in with my parents. I didn't tell them about the racial slurs and other issues, I just told them he was abusive and they accepted that. My parents have been married for over 35 years and they know what a healthy relationship is and they were more than happy to take me in despite my shame of moving in with my parents at age 32. My dad is trying to help me with finding jobs and honestly, it's nice to be at home with my parents and spend time with them. I feel very lucky that I have this safety net available. 

Now on to my racist ex boyfriend. After I moved my stuff out, I told him I was leaving him via text message. He immediately called me and basically cursed me out calling me a ""worthless whore"" and telling me that ""no one will ever put up with you like I have"" and all kinds of other crazy stuff. He called me all types of horrible names and said that he just put up with me because he needed a ""n-word fuck doll"" and that he was glad to be rid of me because I was just a financial burden. I guess he really did just want someone to manipulate and use and after reading the replies here, I was not surprised in the least at his response. It did hurt though, it hurt a lot. I am going to need a lot of therapy to heal from this. I have made an appt with a therapist but because I am currently low income and my state has shitty mental health services, I wont be able to see someone until mid-August. All I can ask is that you guys pray for me. I will try and get through this and come out a better person. 

EDIT: In regards to finishing my Masters, I am going to continue taking the two courses I have over the Summer since they are already paid for and the refund date has passed. My Dad said he would be willing to help me out some to pay for the Fall. He and my mother are both retired and on a fixed income so they can't help a lot but every little bit is ok. I am going to work while attending school and since I won't have to pay any bills while at home, I am optimistic about being able to pay for Fall and then finish my MA program. 


**tl;dr**: Left my racist boyfriend and moved back in with my parents. Trying day by day to heal. "
"My [29/F] husband's [31/M] bizarre behavior is destroying our relationship. Am I over-reacting?


EDIT: WOW. This blew up way more than I anticipated. I'm sorry to the people that I haven't been able to respond to, but I've read most of your comments and I appreciate (most of) them. I wasn't looking for any sort of diagnosis, but the overwhelming support in my feeling that he would strongly, strongly benefit from therapy has solidified my decision to push the matter. I'm going out of town for a week, but I'm going to talk to him when I get back. I'm going to follow some advice and look up some local specialists and present it to him when we're both in a good head-space, so he knows it's serious and that it's not just something I throw out at the end of an argument. Perhaps I'll post on update when there's something to update on. Cheers, Reddit.

Throw-away, as husband knows my reddit account.

Hey Reddit, I'm hoping some unbiased outsiders opinions might help me get some clarity in my current predicament. I'm super sorry if this is long, I *REALLY* appreciate you taking the time, because all of the advice from my friends is pretty much 'that sucks, move home' which is neither particularly helpful nor what I want.

A little bit of history: My husband and I have been married for one year, together for three years. I've always known he has bad social anxiety, which I've always been really supportive of (I myself often battle the anxiety monster). Recently, for his work, we moved from North America to Europe. Our relationship has always been super solid. We have always been completely honest with one-another. No history of lies, infidelity, manipulation. Nothing. Up until recently, I thought we were two solid peas in a pod.

Okay, so, I was understanding for the first month when he'd act extremely panicked when we'd leave the house, but we've been here for four months now and his behavior has gone from panicked to, in my opinion, straight up bizarre and it's both worrying me and completely driving a wedge between us. I sleep on the couch most nights, now. 

He'd been having really aggressive and confusing outbursts pretty much non-stop, but again, I was trying to be understanding that it's probably just his anxiety getting the best of him, but the event that caused me to start sleeping on the couch was this:

- One of my favourite bands that I've been trying to see for 10 years was in town, and also playing at this super cool local venue I'd been dying to check out. So I was really excited, and it was a pretty big deal for me. We're at the venue having some beers and getting along great, when I ask him if he knows where the bathroom is (it should be noted now that this venue is underground, and has some an upstairs/outside patio bar area, and there are two entrances to the downstairs, but I was only aware of one at the time), he says ""it's just upstairs then first door on the left"". So I walk up the only stairs that I'm aware of and see no other doors anywhere. So I wander around for a while and finally find the bathrooms. I come back down, and in completely good-spirits say:
Me: Trying to lead me on a wild-goose chase, eh? The bathrooms weren't exactly to the left. Haha.
Him: Yes, they are.
Me: No way, man, you have to walk all the way around the building.
Him: Oh, which stairs did you go up?
Me: The stairs we came down from originally, aren't they the only ones?
Him: No, there's some over there behind that door*points*
Me: Ooooh! Shit yeah, I didn't even know those were there. Whoops.
Him: Yes, you did. You just used them.
Me: Umm. . . no, I didn't know they existed until you literally just pointed to them.
Him: Why are you lying to me?!
Me: What?! Do you want me to explain the exact path I took to the bathrooms? Dude, I don't even know there those stairs go. I legitimately didn't know they existed until just now.
Him: Yes you fucking did! I know you used them! Why are you lying to me? I saw you walk through that door!
Me: I definitely did not use that door. What does it matter, though, it's just a door. Can we move on?
Him: No! Why are you fucking with me! Why are you trying to make me feel crazy?!
Me (getting concerned at this point): Hey, are you okay? What's really going on?
Him: You're fucking lying to me! You're doing this on purpose! I demand you explain it to me! Why are you trying to make me feel crazy?
The conversation carried on like this for a while. He wouldn't drop it. He storms out a few times, storms back, humiliates me, ruins the night, and I end up leaving with him.

Now, typically in one those standard ""Who ate the last piece of bread?"" arguments where both parties deny it, I'll just say ""Yeah it was possibly me"" to avoid the argument, I'd rather be happy than right all the time. But the fact is, I absolutely didn't even know those stairs existed and I felt like giving in and lying to calm him  down would be enabling some pretty fucked-up behavior, so I didn't. And I wondered, is this how it's going to be every time I don't bend to his will to avoid confrontation? So I told him that if he didn't see a therapist, I couldn't be with him. He absolutely refused, and said it was not an option he would ever consider (even though I've gone to therapy many times and there is absolutely no shame about it in our household). After I told him that I could no longer live like this and would not be sleeping in the same room as him anymore, we finally made an agreement: if he ever had another outburst again, he would agree to go to therapy. Me, thinking nobody can just change their behavior overnight, agreed. It wasn't a matter of 'if', it was a matter of 'when'. 

Now, to his credit, a month has passed and he hasn't had another super aggressive outburst, but he's channeling that bizarre/obsessive behavior into other aspects of his life, and he's having minor 'fits' all the time. In my opinion, many of his behaviors count as further 'outbursts', but he's refusing to go to therapy. 

To try to avoid rambling, I'll do a point-form list of some examples just from the last few days:

- We're going to the grocery store and when he was about to grab a basket I said ""Oh I actually have my cloth bag, we can just use that ask a basket and then we know we won't buy too much to fit"", to which he responds ""Oh, it's no big deal, let's just get a basket"". A perfectly normal interaction. Until I start putting canned beans into the basket and he starts getting extremely agitated about how he thought I just wanted to get enough for the cloth bag, I explained how I thought he meant we should get more when we got the basket, he responds that he /did/ in fact mean that, so I'm confused as to why he's upset. He just keeps repeating ""I just thought you only wanted enough for the cloth bag, that's what you said. And now you're getting more than will fit in the cloth bag. It's just not what you said!"". I tried to calm him down by saying we can just ask for an extra bag at checkout, or put the extra items back, and he made it clear neither of those things were the point. He just kept repeating ""You said you wanted just enough for the cloth bag, and then you changed it!"". I had no idea what he was actually upset about.

- Grocery store again, I'm looking for tea. He starts breathing really heavily and clenching his fists like he was trying to contain his anger. I figured maybe he was getting anxious (even though we'd been in this store probably 30 times at this point and it wasn't busy at all) so I said ""Sorry if this is taking a while, I'm sure it's here somewhere, just a second"" to which he started ranting on: ""Take however long you want, it's fine, you just didn't tell me you wanted fennel tea. What am I supposed to do? I didn't know you wanted fennel tea."" Me, a bit stunned, respond ""Okay. . . I'll just be another second, I know it's here.""
At this point he was borderline crying, and stormed out of the store. He was furious when I got home, and could not explain why, he just kept repeating that he wasn't anticipating me looking for that tea. He could not explain to me why it upset him. 

I could go on, and on, but this is already long enough. A couple more quick notes that might be relevant: He *obsessively* needs to finish what he's saying at all times, no matter what. Even if he's trying to tell me where he left a note for me and I say I already got it, he *has to* finish explaining it in detail.  He's also become *extremely* sensitive to any perceived aggression (like I can't raise my voice to talk to him even if he has headphones on and I'm just trying to tell him that dinner is ready). It's enough to make him cry.

I'm so unhappy, and I just don't know what to do. He's always been such a gentle person, and I don't want to abandon him if he really does need help, but he just won't listen to me.



So, Reddit? Am I over-reacting? Is his behavior normal for somebody with social anxiety? Am I right for feeling he needs to talk to a therapist?
   
**TL;DR: My husband's social anxiety has evolved into aggressive, bizarre behavior since we moved overseas for work. I think he needs therapy and that there's likely something more than social anxiety afoot, he refuses. Uncertain how to move forward.**

"I [28F] just found a ""secret"" folder my husband [29M--married 3 years] had on our computer. It has THOUSANDS of pictures of a celebrity, as well as letters, fictional writings of his and her ""life,"" as well as some X rated recordings of himself. I'm creeped out--what do I do?


Preface...I thought I was married to the perfect guy. He's handsome, charming, athletic as well as a published fiction writer. He's very, very creative in terms of photography, painting and writing. I'm far more right brain so I thought we made a good match.

When we met I knew he has a ""celeb-crush"" on a certain famous actress. I can name her if its relevant but she's kind of like the it girl right now...very beautiful and I had no issues with my husband crushing on a gorgeous woman from afar.

I needed the computer today to find some tax documents and in a folder from our 2014 taxes buried pretty deep was a folder simply titled ""Jen."" I knew right away who it was referencing and if anything I clicked on to give him some good natured ribbing later on.

When I clicked on it there were several sub folders. I would say there are easily 10000 pictures of her in this folder, including ones from the big hacking that took place a few years ago. In another folder where copies of letters he's apparently written to her...id say 20 or 30 total...the last one dated to congratulate her on the movie that just came out. All this is strange but...

In another folder was fiction he'd written about he and she being married, who they would be friends with, where they would live and where they would travel. I only read one of these but there were about 12 stories, I'm guessing about 20-30 pages each. 

The worst thing was he has recorded his voice while talking kind of third person about him having sex with her. There were dozens and dozens of these. I could only handle listing to parts of two of them...one was ""sweet"" and ""romantic,""  the other was a very violent fantasy similar to a role play I have done with him on a few occasions. 

he doesn't know that i know, I left a text saying I would be at my moms and maybe spending the night to help with my nephew who lives with her. I can't handle being around him and I don't even know how to approach this. If a friend's husband had done this my advice would be to leave immediately...but it's not that easy when I'm in the middle of it. 

Very frankly...what do I do?
   
**tl;dr**: Husband has a massive collection of pictures, fantasy stories and even audio of himself describing sexual fantasies with a certain celebrity. I'm creeped out but have no idea what to do.

Edit: wow sorry I had no idea this would blow up..,comments are locked so I can't answer anything. To the top post...I vaguely remember her in terms of hair and eye color and general build but could never be mistaken for her. 

I will approach in a non accusatory manner in person with this as soon as we both get home this evening.  Thank you for rhe advice every one. "
"Me [25F] my husband [30M] won't sleep in our bed unless we have sex


We have been married for two months and a couple for 3 years. He decided that he won’t sleep in our bed with me unless we have sex. It doesn’t matter if we already had sex that day, he won’t sleep in our bed unless we have sex again at night.  I don’t even think that we have an issue with the amount of sex we have anyways, we have it most days, and if we don’t because I’m on my period or am not feeling well or whatever, he gets so grumpy unless I give him a blowjob. 


This started almost immediately after we got married. He has also become much more controlling. I was going to go out for my friend’s birthday party at a bar last night and he got mad that the dress I was wearing was short (“a good wife wouldn’t wear that”) and when I told him who was going to be there, a few of my male friends, he said I couldn’t go, which was really embarrassing to be honest. His reasoning was something like “what kind of man would I be if I allowed you to go out like that around other guys who obviously want to fuck you.”  That's just one of many, many examples.

I don’t know how I can get through to him. Any advice for me? Its really upsetting that he is treating me like a child incapable of making my own decisions, and that he is punishing me for not having sex with him. Are these normal growing pains for newlyweds?

"I [36F] adopted my friend son [14M] years ago. I heard from her all these years later saying she want's to be in his life. Now she has backed out and I have no idea what to tell him


Years ago my best friend (Sally) fell pregnant. We had just finished college and I was starting to get into my career. All sally could talk about was being a mother and how excited she was to be one. To this day have no idea what caused her sudden change in attitude, one day she called me crying on the phone telling me she was not ready to be a mother. I was pregnant with my own child at this point in time and I was ready to give birth in 6 weeks. She was due in another 12 weeks.

Sally wanted to put her child up for adoption. My ex-husband and I chose to adopt her child as our own. So we had two children Harry and Serena [14F]. My kids get along extremely well and are practically best friends. They are about to start High School after the summer vacation. Serena has always been protective of Harry and vice versa. Both kids are perfectly normal nothing mentally or physical wrong for the most part we are a normal family. My ex-husband and I divorced so it’s just me and the kids.

Up until 6 weeks ago I had not heard from his birth mother in years. Last I heard she moved to Chicago with her husband and started a life there. 6 weeks ago I got a Facebook message from her saying she was interested in meeting harry and being in his life. I had a long discussion with her and an even longer one with Harry about it. Harry seemed very interested in meeting his bio mom and he gave the OK to meet her.

So we set up a skype call with Harry and His bio mom and his bio dad. They spoke for a while and I noticed he was calling them by their first name. He called them David and Sally, he did not call them mom or dad. Which I was happy about selfishly because he has always called me mom.

Sally and David were supposed to come out next week to Pennsylvania and meet Harry. 20 minutes ago I got a Facebook message from Sally saying the following “I can’t stand to be around my child who does not refer to me as mom. I am sorry but I can’t come out and doubtful I will ever be able too” That is a bullshit excuse and she knows it, this is the exact same shit she pulled all those years ago. She commits to something and then backs out

She has since blocked me on Facebook and her phone goes right to voicemail. I have no idea how to tell Harry he was looking really forward to it. Harry is upstairs waiting for his girlfriend to get here and I have no idea what to say to him.

tl;dr: My sons bio mom was suppose to start being in his life and get to know him. She has now backed out with some bullshit excuse and I have no idea what to tell him "
"My [25M] boyfriend [28M] tried to screw over my best friend [26F] at work. I told her &amp; he got fired. He blames me now &amp; wants me to pick him or her.


Lots of background into this.

When I was 19 I came out as gay to my super religious family and was immediately disowned. They kicked me out, stopped paying for my education and stopped talking to me. I literally lost everyone in the extended family. I was all alone and unprepared. I was going to an expensive private university and couldn't afford it anymore, I had to drop out and start working full time.

At that time my friend Claire at the university really helped me out. At that time I didn't know that she was from a very rich family (she never lived to show it). She helped me with small things here and there, allowed me to stay with her until I could get my act together, she even paid for me to get therapy when I was dealing with abandonment issues from my family. Really the kindness that she did for me is something I'll never forget. We remained very close friends after that.

I didn't go back to college, just kept working at rather lower wage jobs. A few months after she graduated she asked if I would like a job. She wanted me to be her driver/assistant. She was working in their own family's business and her previous driver was a boring yes ma'am no ma'am old guy that she wasn't comfortable with. She offered me a superb salary and benefits (like 8x what I was making at my job at the time) and I accepted. I've been working for her for two years now and it's been very nice. The workload is low, I drive a super comfy expensive car, I get paid to spend time with my best friend and all in all this is yet another huge favor for me that she's done.

Here comes my boyfriend Jack. He works for Claire's family business. I met him about 18 months ago and he hates Claire. He believed she is a spoiled selfish girl who's only progressing because her dad owns the empire as he puts it. I didn't know that Jack hates her only until a few weeks ago when they apparently had a clash at work. I'm not aware of the details or whose fault it was since that's really not my job but I became aware of the conflict. Claire doesn't have strong opinions towards Jack though, when she learned that we were dating back then she told me that he seems like a good hardworking person.

Jack told me that he's going to put Claire in her place. I asked what he wants to do, he didn't say much except that ""she won't see it coming"". I kept pushing and he told me. It was basically messing up something that will make Claire look very bad and the confidence of others in her would take a huge hit. I begged him not to do it as it was not just wrong and unethical but just petty. He seemed to have made up his mind and I couldn't do anything to change it.

I really had no choice at that point. For one, I had to do the right thing. For two, Claire has done so much for me and I owe her so much in my life and as a result I have very strong loyalty to her. I couldn't sit and let something like this happen to her. So I told her everything. She appreciated my honesty and told me that she knows it must have been difficult to do this to my boyfriend and that she won't forget it. She took care of the whole thing. Jack was fired.

So now he's angry that I told her. He says that I picked her over him and I betrayed him. I keep telling him that I begged him not to do it but he put me in the position of having to choose to do the right thing or keep quiet and let him do something wrong to my best friend. He says he can't believe that I did it.

So now he wants me to show him that I love him and I'm loyal to him by cutting contact with Claire and quitting the job. I don't want to do that. Claire is my best friend and I owe her a lot. This job is great and I want to keep it. But I don't want to break up with him either. He made a horrible mistake and he's angry that he lost it. But he keeps pressuring me to make a decision and I'm just tired of it.

Is there any chance for our relationship?

"[UPDATE] My [21F] parents [38F &amp; 37M] do not discipline my brothers [6M &amp; 9M] and it's becoming a problem


Hey Reddit, I just wanted to give a short update if anyone cares about my situation. With some help from Reddit and me finally deciding to be an adult, things have improved.  

Here is the original:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4c1pxf/my_21f_parents_38f_37m_do_not_discipline_my/?


I finally sat down with my parents about a week after I made the original post and explained to them my concerns about their lack of discipline towards my brothers. It ended up being a long, heated and emotional conversation that I won't go into too much detail about but there was a lot of things my parents were hiding from me. Including a suicide attempt from by my mother about a year and half ago. My parents agreed that we would do family therapy and my mother will start to take her medications and go to a therapist on her own time. My mom explained to that she misses me a lot and we agreed that I would come home 2 times a month or she would come spend a weekend with every month, we would facetime weekly and text everyday. She also took a new part time job, which I know makes her happy.

My parents agreed that they would start to discipline my brothers more, after I showed them a detailed list of dates and incidents where they did not in the past year. In the two months since the post, their behavior has been met with almost appropriate discipline. My parents are working toward making themselves better parents. 


With a lot of argument my parents have let me take Molly in, she is adjusting to her new home nicely and hopefully she will be returned with my parents and brothers when things have calmed down at home. 

All in all, we are working together to make a better family. Thank you Reddit for your advice. 

TL:DR - My parents agreed to go to family therapy and discipline my brothers as well. We are working together to make things better for everyone. "

"[UPDATE] My (19f) psychotic symptoms are affecting my job performance. I'm afraid I'm going to be fired if I don't explain what's going on.


I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nlgm4/my_19f_psychotic_symptoms_are_affecting_my_job/) a few days ago, discussing my fear of getting fired over developing psychotic symptoms. It's been a roller coaster of a few days, but my situation is slowly having an amazing upturn. 

I managed to get to work for my 8-hour shift on Sunday, after apologizing to my bosses for the millionth time. I worked for a few hours until they both came in for the afternoon. They called me to the back and I braced myself, waiting for the worst. 

As soon as they closed the door... they both gave me a big hug! My head manager said that my asst. manager had told her everything that had happened on Friday night and that she could tell that my personality had been changing. She said that it seemed like I was struggling with something that was out of my control, but that I remained an excellent worker and someone they didn't want to let go of. My asst. manager backed up everything she said and told me, ""I know I criticize you often, but you've always been dependable and we don't want your illness to get in the way of doing your job, which you've been so good at doing up until now.""

They said that I didn't need to disclose any personal medical information, but that they would work with me if my doctors found any accommodations to be helpful to me. And they let me get back to work! With job security! I felt so much better and was able to get through the day. 

And I went to my first psychiatry appointment on Monday and it went great. I've been seeing a therapist daily for CBT since then to reduce symptoms of psychosis and I will be on meds by the end of the week. Even better news: my psychiatrist doesn't think I have schizophrenia, but a psychotic disorder NOS. So I will have a better chance at controlling my symptoms and getting back to normal :) I'm confident I can handle my illness with time and patience. Thank you for all your help!

TL;DR I wasn't fired and it looks like I'll keep my job! + good leeway on my treatment. Everything is looking up and I'm taking things a day at a time"

"Is it bad that I [19M] don't want a relationship with my new step-mother?


My father recently remarried.  The new woman is my step-mom.  My father and mother had a divorce 4 years ago because my dad was having an affair and the woman he married now is the woman he was having an affair with.

The divorce was extremely difficult for me mentally and emotionally.  For a long time I found it difficult to forgive my father, but then I did forgive him, because, well, he is my father, and I love him dearly.  He did something wrong and betrayed my mother, but I still love him very much, he is my father.

However, now the woman he's marrying is the woman he betrayed my mother with.  The woman who wrecked our home and our family.  I feel strange emotions towards her, anger and hatred, even though I've barely even met her.

Needless to say I do not want her as my step mom and I did not want my dad to marry.  He made his choice and chose to marry her, its his choice.  But I don't want to accept her as my step mother, I don't want to ever have a relationship with her or even speak with her.

I moved out of home permanently when I found out my dad was going to marry her and she was going to move in with us.  I moved out for that reason and now I'm renting with friends.

My mother and my father keep pushing me to put the past in the past and just be nice to this woman and accept her as my step mother.  But I don't want to, I don't want to accept her as my anything, I don't want to be nice to her or even speak to her.

What they did was horrible, and I am not obliged to forgive them. I forgive my father because he's my father and I love him, but she is nothing to me, I don't have to forgive her. I still hate her.

My parents keep pushing me to accept her as my step-mom and be nice to her, but I don't want to at all.  Am I bad for doing that? Am I in the wrong here? Do I not have the right to refuse to have a relationship with someone if I don't want to?

"Is this a red flag and demonstration of disrespect or am I [24F] exaggerating (upd4te)


tl;dr(1st post): bf K thinks I (Podiatry student) should stick with treating fungal nail infections and that I shouldn't try and help someone because clearly I can't know other medical things. 




**Original:** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lya9f/is_this_a_red_flag_and_demonstration_of/




So things took a weird turn. Initially I was going to give him all of my previous lectures and notes from uni so that he could see that we get taught basically everything and that way he could understand. I was waiting for my break to do it properly. But K (bf) got sick. 


He didn't want to see a doctor even though I tried talking him into one several times. I decided to look at it myself and welp he had hemorrhoids. I told him to get some laxatives and even got him some drinkable fiber and ointment to help with the pain. I told him what to eat and what not to eat to help relieve it. 


Although he did start drinking the fiber drink, he didn't control his diet. Continued eating junk and spicy foods. Didn't eat any veg or fruit. Didn't get laxatives and didn't use the ointment either. 


The pain gradually got worse such that he was in severe pain the entire day and night. I was still encouraging him to see a doc but had given up actually getting through to him. 


 K starts talking to one of his friends whos an intern (med student) and well this guy tells him he should go to the emergency because he probably has thrombosis. 


My stupid bf starts telling me how he has to rush to the doctors because of this and how his friend is so smart and other shit I didn't care enough to listen. 


I tell this idiot that the likelihood of him having thrombotic hemorrhoids is very low. He starts telling me that a- Im not a doctor so I shouldn't make such comments and 2.  when the doctor tells us that he has thrombosis that Im going to look so stupid. 



Anyone want to bet what he had ? Yeah NOT freaking thrombosis!. 


His doctor gave him laxatives and ointments for the hemorrhoid along with ""stop eating junk food stupid, eat fiber"" talk. 


I was so pissed. He couldn't even visit a doctor even though I pleaded with him  several times over and over again. 


But the moment the friend tells him to see a doctor hes rushing to visit one! His friend didn't even examine him yet his advice was more valuable than any of mine. 



 
I think he could tell I was pissed afterwards because he started telling me how ""smart"" I am. And how lucky he is to have someone like me. He started getting goofy with ""when are we going to move in together and get married so you can look after me properly"" I told him to go move in with his intern friend. They'd get along better. 


I don't think this is going to work. Im done trying to prove myself to him. If he has this little interest in anything I say, its not going to change. And I can't be with someone who disrespects me this much. 
   

I haven't had the talk with him yet but judging by how hes constantly calling and trying to be goofy/sweet I think he knows its coming. So thats it 


thanks guys. 

**tl;dr**: Bf had hemorrhoids and didnt listen to anything I said. The moment his friend got involved though he was all ears to him. Im no longer trying to get him to understand as I simply dont care. "
"[Update] I [28F] got played badly, and it's hurting so much. Please tell me something nice to help get over this.


My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n213k/i_28f_got_played_badly_and_its_hurting_so_much/) actually didn't get a whole lot of attention, so it seems a bit silly to post an update. (Tl;dr: Against better judgment, I responded to romantic advances of a coworker and fell for him hard, while he only wanted to f*ck me)

But I'm going to do it anyway, because I was actually surprised by a lot of the comments that I received. Here is what happened.

In the original post, I berated myself for having been naive, having fallen for him, having started anything in the workplace, etc. I was hurting a lot, and I was looking for the affirmation that it wasn't my fault, and that the guy that I was involved with was actually a jerk, which Reddit confirmed. But a lot of the comments also said that I was being too hard on myself, and that I wasn't loving myself.

I've had a pretty successful career so far, I've had way more successes than failures, and so I have a very high self-esteem (or so I thought), so these comments were a surprise to me. One comment in particular really stood out. The comment said, **Think about your situation as if it were happening to a friend, or to your little sister. You wouldn't hate her. You'd want to give her a hug. Treat yourself with that same compassion, okay?** Other comments were approximately the same thing, ""Be kind to yourself,"" ""stop blaming yourself,"" etc.

And that really struck a chord with me. If it were my little sister going through what I've gone through instead of me, I would NEVER say any of the things that I said on the post. I would want her to indulge herself, go out with her friends, go on dates, and just have fun! I thought that I already loved myself, but I wasn't being loving enough to me!

So I basically followed my own advice that I'd give to anyone that I care. I bought myself some things that I have been wanting for months! I started going through some jazz piano lessons that I've been meaning to learn for ages (I'm a classical pianist who is secretly a jazz groupie). I tried out several new restaurants that I've wanted to go to with my best friend, and we also went out to see a concert. I had a couple of friends over and we chatted and baked cookies and had some wholesome fun. I also went out for social gatherings to meet some new people, and also went on a date, and during the past week or so, FIVE men told me that I was cute/pretty/beautiful. Okay, one of them was my date, but two of them were random men on the street who didn't even have to talk to me!

I'm obviously still kinda sorta hurting from the fact that someone I thought was my friend had betrayed/disrespected me that much, and I really hope that his life brings him a lot of misery, but he is really out of my life completely and I won't be there to see it, so it doesn't matter a whole lot. AND I am so much happier already.

So this is why I decided to write this update, Reddit.

I think it's really difficult not to be hard on yourself when going through something like a breakup, especially in the cases in which you didn't do anything wrong but the other person was a jerk. If you're going through some difficult times, I hope that you will all take a step back, and ask yourself, if it were your loved one going through your situation, what would you tell them to do? And I hope that you do exactly that for yourself. Doing that will also shift the focus onto how to make yourself happy, and not on how to make some external factor miserable (and this is something you have no control over), and I found that it was very helpful for my mental well-being. Honestly, you can never love yourself enough.

Thank you, Reddit. I feel like I learned such an important life lesson from a throwaway post that I wrote in a half-crazed state of misery. For that lesson, everything I went through for the past month was really worth it. It would make me even happier if I am able to pay that feeling forward, and that is why I am writing this update. I'm writing this in the hopes that someone else who is going through a similar situation as I just did stumbles upon this post, that this post will make them get better.

I love you, Reddit! Thank you so, so, so much! Have a great weekend (what's left of it), and I hope you have a great week! I know I will :)

He loves lingerie, and I recently got a gift card to the adult store here in town and picked out some of his favorite color lingerie and was super stoked.

We were at home and watching reruns of Cops. I had been rubbing his thigh and he was into it. And then I decided to run into the bathroom and change into my lingerie for some sexy times.

I came out and he was sitting on Facebook, looked up at me and said ""I'm really tired."" then went to bed. And then today he suggested we go until my birthday (end of a July) without sex so that it can be this big exciting build up.

I was at a loss. I don't even know how to proceed here.

"My [25f] brother [27m] lost over 200 pounds. He is now a jerk that people don't want to be around and he thinks people hate him because they are jealous. How can I make him see the truth?


I have been thinking of ways to ask this question  for awhile and every time  I type it out I just delete it because it doesn't  feel right. I love my older brother ""Ryan"" dearly and have always felt  protective  of him. We grew up in a toxic home after our  mom left and our dad married a woman that hated us and told us all the time. I dealt with the situation  with therapy and some acting out as a teen. Ryan used food to cope with his problems and at his heaviest he was a little over 350lbs.

His wakeup call came after a uncle of ours, who was also obese, ended up losing his toes to diabetes. Ryan began working out and dieting hard core along with having lap band surgery. That was three years ago and since then he looks great. He is now more confident, much healthier, and unfortunately, a major jerk who projects  his insecurity  on other people.

On thanksgiving  he was invited to spend the day with a cousin, the daughter of our uncle with diabetes. We were pretty close with her so while my wife and I were helping prepare  dinner she offered to make Ryan a low sugar/ carb meal along with her dad's  so that he could enjoy the holiday as well. During the meal prep he kept hovering over her and telling her how she was killing the other family members  with the unhealthy  meal the others were stuck with, that she was just trying to undo the damage  her dad did to himself. I kept telling him to leave the kitchen and get out but he insisted  on being ""honest"" with her even if it was hard to hear. Finally she just lost her temper and dumped the meal she made him in the trash and told him to leave her home.

My wife and I apologized for his behavior  and the entire meal was just awkward and quiet until we left. That night  I got into an argument  with my brother  and he thinks that he was right and that she should have made the whole family the healthier meal. We didn't speak  to for awhile after that and my cousin deleted him off of her social media accounts.

Now Ryan is out of control with shaming random people he sees, myself, and the few friends he has left. He was actually  banned  from his gym after he took a picture of an overweight  woman  using a treadmill  there and posted it to Facebook with a caption along the lines of  ""putting food in front of them to make them run"". At his new gym he has already caused some drama (don't know the reason yet) but some of the regulars there filed a complaint  against him.

My wife also hates having him around he because of his ""jokes"" and I am sick of it too. He insists  that he isn't being rude but he is just ""honest"" and that the people who are offended are just overly sensitive  and need a reality  check. I am at my wits end. I love my brother and I want to help him but his behavior  is causing a rift in my family  and I don't  want to be stuck in the middle anymore!

   
;tldr; brother lost over 200 pounds. Projects his insecurity  on other people and acts like an ass."
"Me [25 M] with my GF [24 F] of 1.5 years. She brought home a kitten after 9 months of me saying ""No"" - Don't know how to handle things


**EDIT: I just want everyone to know that I have read through most, if not all of your posts and am currently handling the situation at hand. None of you are being ignored and I'm thankful for everything you've shared. I will post a more complete update when I feel a conclusion has been reached. Thanks again.**

For the last 9 months or so, my girlfriend has been asking to get a pet. At first it was a dog or cat and when I said that I didn't think we were ready for it, she would still bring it up until finally backing down - or so I thought. 6 months ago it was her birthday and she brought up getting a pet again, and I responded with the same reasons why:

* Small apartment(which I would like to note that I pay for and is in my name for transparency sake)
* When I was younger I was allergic to cats, so I'm not sure if I will be this time around or to what severity
* I feel our relationship is still too young to commit to a pet
* We have very different work hours, but both each work in surplus of 40 hours a week. Sometimes as much as 60.
* A pet is an expensive thing if you treat them properly and right now I'm very concerned with trying to pay off my student loan debt.
* I did tell her that I certainly want pets in the future, because I grew up with both cats and dogs and love them both, but that time isn't right now.


The week before her birthday, we agreed to get a Fish instead. It would bring life to our apartment, was low maintenance, and felt like a good compromise. On her birthday, when we were going to get one, she told me she didn't want a fish and that she was hoping I'd just reconsider for a cat or dog. So I said once again that I wasn't ready for one and we got into another fight about it.


On and off for the last 6 months she would say that she wanted a Cat and kept saying how low maintenance they are and how she would be the one taking care of it. I insisted that I didn't think we were ready for a pet yet. And that I wouldn't be ready until our living conditions, work schedules, and finances changed a bit - she of course disagreed and we have been arguing about it since... UNTIL


Last night, after I went to work(I work overnights) she messaged me on Facebook and told me that she paid for and brought a kitten home. I was absolutely shocked that she would do this. I feel completely disrespected and like my feelings about it are worthless. 


We argued about it, a lot. At first I didn't know what to say, but felt like I had to seem incredibly upset, because I am, and don't want to make it seem like I'll let this all be ok. But now, we seem to be at a stand still. She says she's keeping the Kitten and I told her to bring it back after work today. 


I do love my girlfriend, but I feel like this violates any kind of partnership I thought we had. She said she thinks I try to act more like a ""figurehead"" in our relationship than a partner, and maybe that is the case, but this certainly isn't what a partnership should be like, right?


**tl;dr**: How should I handle my girlfriend bringing home a kitten after I've been telling her that I don't want one *yet* for the last 9 months?"

"Update to ""Me [31M, European] with my girlfriend [29 F, Chinese] of one year; very different cultural expectations of financial management""


**[tl;dr of previous post](https://redd.it/4kyqgf)**: my Chinese girlfriend of almost a year thinks that, if and when we get married, I would deposit all of my money and income into an account solely in her name. I'm not comfortable with that. I'm also not comfortable with her sending all of our excess money back to her parents in China.

Apologies for the length. I'm a bit out of it, so this isn't the most concise writing I've ever done.

First, I'd like to thank everyone for their feedback from my previous post. It gave me a lot to think about: about the strong cultural differences between us; and about some specific personal issues too.

On sending money to her parents, and ""filial piety"" in general, I decided that I didn't really have any claim on how she spent money on her family, and the cultural institution was too deeply ingrained to try and tackle it. So long as we had separate income and savings, I think it makes sense for her to fulfill her duty to her parents if she sees fit.

On a wife controlling all finances, there seemed to be much less consensus as to whether or not that was normal, or the done thing. In spite of some people thinking that it might be a good idea, I definitely still wasn't on board. It also annoyed me how we were splitting bills was heavily weighted against me, but she still made me feel guilty any time I asked her to pay for anything.

Then, something that I didn't ask about, but came up anyway, was how we shared responsibilities in the relationship outside of money. She has very specific and strict ideas about what I guess you would call chivalry. In her view, men should treat women like princesses all the time: carry handbags, umbrellas, shopping, opening doors, walking on the right side, paying for everything obviously, taking up as little room in bed as possible, cooking meals, cleaning her flat.

There have been a few examples of her being careless about my money. The worst was a few months ago, we were due to take a trip to my home country. A week before we got into a fight, and she told me to cancel our accommodation reservation. I thought this was the first step in a break up, which (at the time) horrified me. I canceled the reservation but begged her to reconsider. After I apologised and she got over her anger, she was shocked to learn that we had nowhere to stay for our holiday. In the end I booked a much more expensive last minute hotel on the understanding that we would split the cost. Months later, she still hasn't paid me back, and she sulks every time I bring it up.

All this made me start to look at her, and how she spent money in a new light. Shout out to /u/ralpher1 for predicting almost exactly which brands of handbag she owned. I did some research on her favourite bags and shoes and scarves, and at a guess, I would say she about thirty thousand pounds worth of luxury goods that she liked to wear and carry often. I had no idea clothes and accessories could cost so much money. I'm not exactly anti-materialist, but I was shocked by this. I figured that spending habits would have to be part of any conversation on our futures together.

I didn't want to give up on what I thought was a good relationship just yet, so I decided to take a risk and open up to her about my financials. I showed her a summary of my income, expenditure, budget and savings. This was a mistake. She pretty much immediately started talking about what we could buy with my savings; and saying that I wasn't earning enough money so I should stop messing around with computers and go back to working in finance (which is not going to happen). I tried to explain to her that I was showing her this so she could see how I lived my life, and how savings were for the future, not so that she could plan to expand her lifestyle now. We went on for hours back and forth. I think somebody called it in the last thread, but she really did think ""what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine."" I don't even know if she ever came to understand how I would have a problem with that. It seemed so natural to her that I think she couldn't even see my side of things.

I did learn that she doesn't have any money saved at all. She does earn a lot, but she feels she has to send any money left over at the end of the month back to her parents. That's why she lives an extravagant lifestyle buying luxury goods: if she doesn't have any money then she doesn't have to send it back. I still don't really know what financial situation her parents are in. They might not even need the money, for all I know, but they all feel that her sending it has to happen.

The next morning, she asked me to move to Singapore with her. She wanted to be closer to her parents, and since we were planning our futures together... This pretty much blew my mind. I was trying to figure out if there was anything left to salvage in our relationship. I'd built up a lot of resentment over being treated like a eunuch servant and being expected to hand over all my money for the privilege. She thought that was a good time for us to move to the other side of the world.

So I told her I was breaking up with her. At this point, I don't know if the two of us were ever on the same page about anything, because she never saw this coming. She was distraught, and didn't know why I was unhappy, and she'd do anything to keep me, I was the best thing that ever happened to her. I fell for this for a couple of days, before she got screaming angry at me for breaking a wine glass while I was washing dishes (I'd argue we were equally at fault). She demanded I pay for it (holy crap, how much money can a wine glass cost), and apologise for being careless. I wish I could say I did something cool like just leave cash on the table and walk out. But I argued back and got dragged into the whole thing.

I ended up replacing the glass, and apologising. But the next morning I gathered all my stuff from her place and took it home before she woke up. I came back later, woke her up, and told her we had to break up. I'd already explained all the reasons why last time we talked, and I was afraid that she would manipulate me into staying again, so I walked out right after telling her. A cowardly way to do it, I know.

That was last weekend. Feeling pretty numb, with a lot of anger and resentment underneath the surface. Now that I'm away from her, I see she treated me really badly for pretty much the whole relationship. I'm pissed at myself for not standing up to her and her tantrums and selfishness sooner. I don't know why I let her get away with it for so long.

&lt;edit&gt;
Quick note that my ex is Shanghainese, not Singaporean. She wanted to move to Singapore to be close enough to visit her family, but still be able to find high paying work in her field.
&lt;/edit&gt;

"My [15M] mother [40F] passed away. I have gone to live with my aunt [43F] and her two daughters [16F&amp;14F] seemed nice at first. But last night they and their friends ditched me and I had no idea where I was.


Hi everyone, let me first off say thanks for any and all advice. I am so lost right now and I don't really know what to do. 

My mother passed away from Cancer recently and it pretty much left me with no where to go. My sister [19F] would have gladly taken me in. But she lives in a dorm on campus at her college. She also has a job that is not the best and can barely support herself. That I know mom always had to loan her money when she was desperate. She was really upset that I could not come live with her. My sister and I skype almost every day and if not we talk on Facebook. I miss her alot I really do but I am going to get to see her in 3 weeks :). 

I had to move state to live with my aunt. I like my Aunt Chloe she never forgot a birthday, christmas. I miss my friends and my girlfriend back home alot as well so the move has not been easy on me. 

So fast forward some time and I moved state to live with my Aunt Chloe. When I arrived she showed me my room and it is pretty nice in their. It is big and it is a pretty nice home and neighbourhood. Her two daughters had an interest in me and I thought we did at least. 

I have a Brooklyn accent because I was born and raised in Brooklyn. Her two daughters Violet [16F] and Amy [14F] thought it was the coolest thing ever. They kept asking me things about Brooklyn and I was more than happy to tell them. It reminded me of home. 

I only moved here last week and I am still getting use to my new city/state. I still don't know the neighbourhood to well and just the area in general. Last night they asked if I wanted to come out with them and meet some of their friends. I thought it was a good idea because I still don't have that many friends here. 

I got dressed and I take pride in my appearance. So yeah I can take a little long to do my hair and get ready for the evening. 20 minutes at max. They made the comment "" You take longer to get ready then we do, and we're girls"".

This was about 6:00 pm last night. They told me we were going over to a friends house and that it was a while away. We walked for about 40 minutes. Violet got a text on her phone and apparently their had been a change of ""plans"". I call bullshit they ever intended to to take me to a friends house. She said we had to go meet them at the park. 

We did and by this stage it was 7:00 pm and we finally made it to the park. I met their two friend both male and I want to say around 16-17 years of age. I feel like a fucking moron right now because at about I want to say 7:30 they all told me there was this really cool thing they wanted to show me. Instead of guiding me there they pointed it out to me. 

I went to go check it out and it was practically nothing. I turned around and I saw them all running away. I freaked out for a minute but I calmed myself down thinking it was probably just a joke. 

I thought no way in hell they would have ditched me. Remain calm and they should return shortly. I waited in the park for 45 minutes, at that point it was clear they were not coming back. I started to freak out and I was not thinking right. 

The obvious thing to do was call my aunt. How ever I was in such a panic I did not think of it. I started to retrace the steps we walked to get to the park and I noticed I was completely lost. I composed myself and I remembered I knew the name of the street I lived in. I tried to use my phone to connect to google maps but no such luck.

I composed myself again and I went to someone for help. I walked up to some random house and I knocked on the front door. A woman probably mid 20's answered the door. I explained to her my situation and I asked if she knew how to get to the street I lived in.  

She said she didn't but she could look it up on her computer. This woman helped me out alot and she wrote down directions of how to get from her place to my place. I thanked her and I started my journey home.  

I found my way home alright and by this point I was so angry at my situation. My aunt was not home she had gone out for dinner with her best friend (note she left). My two cousins were not home either and I was just so tired that I went to bed. 

I heard my cousins come home and It took everything in my body not to get up and confront them. I didn't and here is why, this is their home. They have lived her alot longer than I have and they are my Aunts children. If I disrespect them I disrespect her and that is not right after she has given me a place to go.  

I don't know if I should tell my Aunt about this. Because they are letting me stay in their home and I have been here for only a week. I don't think I should rock the boat because I have to go to school with these girls. 

I still have my Sophomore, Junior and senior years of high school left with these girls. If they did this to me for no reason imagine what they will do IF I give them a reason.  


 



   
**tl;dr**: My cousins ditched me in the park last night. I had no idea where I was or how to get home until a lady helped me. I don't know if I should tell my aunt about this. These girls treated me like this for no reason and imagine what they could do If I gave them a reason. "
"I (27f) am getting married to my fiancé (29m) in England in 3 weeks. My best friend and bridesmaid (27f) back home won't come unless I pay for her boyfriend to come as well


As the title says I am getting married  in 3 weeks to my fiancé who I have been with for 5 years.

I am originally from the US and met my fiancé while on holiday in England. I moved in with him very shortly after meeting and we have been together since. 

My fiancé has a well paying job and has offered to pay for plane tickets for 5 people, my best friend being one of them. The rest being family. 

I am working a retail job at the moment, so money on my side is not great. 

Now, my best friend (Paige) agreed to be my bridesmaid almost a year ago and I bought her ticket a month later. In the mean time she has started dating a man (28M) who I have not met or associated with in any sense. 

She messaged me on Facebook last night asking me to pay for a plane ticket for her boyfriend and when I declined she said that unless I pay for his ticket, she will not come to my wedding. 

I am at a loss for what to do. She's a huge part of this ceremony and my life. But I just don't have the money to pay for it. Should I bite the bullet and put it on my credit card? 


TL;DR Best friend and bridesmaid won't come to my wedding abroad unless I pay for a plane ticket for her boyfriend of a few months who I have never met. 


Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice. I have decided to contact her and ask her if she's serious and if it's maybe her boyfriend forcing her to ask. I will then make my decision on how to proceed from there. I'll update as soon as I have a final answer. You have all been wonderful and I truly appreciate every single one of your responses. "

"UPDATE!!!- me (f,24) with my girlfriend (f, 23) she found out a secret from a few years ago that I preferred wouldn't have gotten out and now she's mad at me and saying I lied to her

well reddit I know how much you love it when updates tell all about the crashing and burning of a relationship but unfortunately for you guys (and fortunately for me) this is a happy one!! 

okay I just wanted to clarify that I don't have any contact with the girl who murdered someone anymore. most of the letters are from before the trial when it first happened, and then there's like 10 or so that she's sent me over the years asking how I'm doing and stuff. 

also, yes it happened over a boy (isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard of) but the keyword here being BOY as in the girl who did it is not gay whatsoever so April would not be in any danger by a jealous ex when she got out, and also she isn't getting out for a long long time anyways. 

now to the update!! 

April told me her sister needed her to watch her nieces for the rest of the day, so she wasn't gonna be able to talk that morning before I went to work. 

I was disappointed because I got some great advice on here and wanted to try it out and talk to her about everything. 

well, when I got home there was a bouquet of flowers sitting on the coffee table with a note that said ""I'm sorry, I love you"" 

I was confused because April said she was gonna be at her sisters all day, but then when I walked in the kitchen April was sitting at the table looking really nervous. 

turns out, April only had to watch them until the morning like usual and she only told me that so that she could go to the store and get everything without me calling her because we usually always eat lunch together on our lunch breaks. 

she had made my favorite dinner (chicken Alfredo, if you're wondering) and my favorite dessert and had been doing that all day waiting for me to get home. 

she sat me down and started saying how sorry she was that she reacted like that, that she was just shocked and a little hurt that I didn't tell her that but she said she realizes now that she didn't have any reason to be hurt and that I don't have to share anything with her until I'm ready. 

by now I was crying because it felt so good to hear that from her, and I told her that she's still very much the only girl in the world for me and that I can't wait to marry her someday. 

so as we ate dinner I decided to open up for the first time in 7 years. I told her all about my teenage years, my friend that killed someone, the murder itself, the trial and everything in between. 

she started crying (sorry we're both some very emotional girls lol) and saying how sorry she was that I had to go through that and she understands now why I wouldn't want to talk about it. she said, once again, that she was sorry for how she reacted and she was ashamed of it, that it was just a knee jerk reaction to finding out about something like that. 

so after a very emotional dinner we decided to go to the theater and watch finding dory and have a little date night. 

all night it was obvious something in our relationship had changed. I felt such a huge relief to not have that chip on my shoulder anymore and now that everything was out in the open, I don't know how to describe it. our bond just felt stronger, maybe? even though that sounds super cliche lol. but if anything, she just reassured me that we can take on the world together and she loves me for me, not who I was as a teenager. and that feels damn good. 

anyways, 

tl;dr- I love this girl more than anything in the world and everything worked out. she also makes some bomb ass chicken Alfredo. "
