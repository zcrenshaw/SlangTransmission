"How do I [m 45] help my wife [45 f] with loss of baby?


As you can see, my wife and I are older. We have a son and a daughter both in college and have been together for 25 years, and weren't going to have any more kids. Then, she got pregnant.


It was great we were happy, we were ready, we are in a great position in our lives to have another baby. The pregnancy was fine, and we had no worries, then she had our son.

He had an enlarged heart that no one caught. I'm personally trying to cope with the fact that no one saw it. He lived for three days and passed and it was the worst experience of my life. I was holding him when he died.


My wife is an absolute mess. We made the guest bedroom into the baby's room and she goes in there and screams. I'll go home and she'll be laying there with the things we bought him and bawling. She won't go anywhere, she barely eats or speaks to anyone but me. She does go to greif counseling, but it's not helping. I did go to a session with her once, she's mad at me because I was holding him when he died. While I understand her anger, it's misplaced. Because that was incredibly hard and I'm still having nightmares about it...

When I suggested maybe we should donate the stuff she had a meltdown. I could go on and on about all the things she's been doing since the loss.

TL;DR older parents, baby died of unexpected heart issues and wife is beside herself. Greif counseling not helping.

EDIT:A few people have asked, and, she doesn't work. Never has. My son describes me as ""loaded"" got into the internet before it took off. 

All I'm saying about her greif is she hasn't improved at all. She was this upset six months ago. I want her to grieve, and I'd never take that away from her, but I also want her to get better... I love her."

"UPDATE:Coworker [25F] thinks we [22F] [20 - 30 F/M] are using ""office politics"" to bully her? It was just a prank?


Previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uidmt/coworker_25f_thinks_we_22f_20_30_fm_are_using/)

So I didn’t confront Kathy during break. I didn’t even get to decide whether or not I wanted to because as soon as my break started, my Supervisor, Linda approached me. Linda explained that she knew Kathy reached out to me about the office clique. Over lunch, she told a story about how something like this happened to her in high school, and that Kathy was reaching out to me to be her proxy. That she knows I don’t hold these events but I should speak on Kathy’s behalf. I said I understood when another Supervisor,Dan butted in. 

Dan said Kathy also told him about the office problem, but he ignored it because he knew she has been invited. They discussed it among themselves and cited that people have used the company email to send out invites. This allowed the Supervisor to see the exchanges between everyone. Kathy had been invited and bluntly stated no to several things/not to waste her time. 

Linda apologized to me and told me to forget about the Kathy issue but the core message still counts. 

When I went to the break room, Kathy made a bee line for me. She started questioning me about how my talk with the Supervisor went. How together we could take down the ageist office group and that we should get coffee after work.  

I lied saying I had a family thing and went home. At home, I checked the reddit post and went back onto Kathy’s fb. There was a new post about how she was playing a little office prank on the office idiot. People commented her to “spill” but she didn’t update them. I feel like that was about me. 

I started screen capping her posts, though only the ones that flat out bullied people. I felt like HR would care about those then any grey areas. Aside from the racist post about Brad, she made a post about a plan to sleep with a married coworker by getting him drunk. 

All of this has been weird. At work, Kathy is a professional, determined and a little head strong. But in this field, thats a good thing. She gets good scores/reviews from clients. But now all I see is her posting vile things about people I care about. Calling it “TruthTea” then running to me like a victim of a make believe problem. 

I’m going to avoid her unless we’re on a project together. I don’t want to be her flying monkey. I don’t know what to believe from her anymore. 

TL;DR: Didn't confront Kathy but she got a Supervisor to talk to me. We found out she was lying and now I'm avoiding her. 

Edit: To answer someone who PM-ed me. Yes, I have high functioning autism. Yes, people at work know. 

Edit 2:

HR emailed me back. They said they were calling Kathy into work this weekend. Since the office isn't open the weekends, it's clear she's in trouble. As advised from an earlier reply, I'm not going to check her FB anymore. Though watching the fall out would be nice/have a laugh, I would feel petty (?)

I don't think Linda was trying to force me to do anything. She understands that I don't get some social things (If you check out my last post/replies, I literally said Kathy should just ask to be included). She was just trying to explain it in a way I'd understand. 

I fixed ""budded"" to ""butted"". Thank you for catching that.

I looked into the term ""Flying monkey"", and another subreddit came up (RBN). The people described there sound a lot like Kathy. 

I'm signing out now so I won't be replying until Monday. Sorry. 

Edit 3:
It looks like she was fired over the weekend. Her desk is empty but dented. I think she put up a fight because some coworker's desk decor are damaged. 

I won't be checking her FB to see the fall out. I have blocked her and am hoping for the best.

Hey guys, so it's been a crazy 2 weeks or so and I figured I'd fill you all in. I called my mom after seeing all your posts and worked up the courage to tell her what's been happening. She came and picked me up from school on Friday night and we had a long talk over the 3 hours home. Basically, she flat out told me that my dad is definitely using drugs. She knows, she's known this whole time. (Apparently she's got a good poker face). She didn't know that my dad had been taking money from me and my brothers, which really upset her. She has been trying for years to talk to my dad about his addiction but he always denies it (but she's not dumb, she knows what addiction looks like she says). We decided to hold an intervention on Saturday morning with my brothers and my mom. I had no idea how hard it would be. I've never been through anything more emotionally exhausting in my life, and honestly still can't believe that I had to do such a thing with my dad. I wish I could explain to you how normal of a guy his, and what a good person he is (besides this addiction). It was so painful to sit and accuse him of this, and have him deny it for probably an hour or so of us pleading with him and telling him that we'd still support him. Long story short, we eventually got it out of him. He broke down, and I mean BROKE. I have NEVER seen him cry, but he was in hysterics. He has a heroin addiction. It's been going on for years, and throughout the night he slowly confessed pieces of his habits. How much he was using, etc. He said he'd get clean for himself, and for us. He said it started after the pain was too much to handle after a surgery. I had to go back to school Sunday night, and he spent the week at a detox center. He's now home and looking into recovery centers, NA meetings, ect. He's a very different person, but not in a good way. He's angry, short tempered, and honestly so nasty. I've never seen him this foul, and I feel bad for my little brother having to witness it first hand. I read online it's his brain chemicals balancing itself out again or something? God I hope it's true.
My mom honestly had no idea how bad the finances were and took a good hard look at everything she thought was under control. It's not. He hasn't made a mortgage payment in quite some time and it looks like we're going to lose the house. I'm so broken right now, I can't believe my life is this. I can't my mom and my brothers, and my dad have to go through this. I want to thank everyone for their wisdom in what an addiction looks like. I feel so dumb for missing so many signs.

  **tl;dr**: Dad was a heroin addict. You guys were right."
"My extended family disowned my cousin [40sM] when he came out to them decades ago. I [28F] recently found him on Facebook and want to reach out to him.


As a kid, my primary babysitter/after school caretaker was my dad's cousin, Tony. When I was in fourth grade, Tony came out to his parents. They disowned him, kicked him out of the house, and told the whole extended family who also disowned him. He moved away soon after, and I was heartbroken that someone who had been such a big part of my life so far was just suddenly gone with no goodbye.  Nobody in the family explained to me, and when I got older I just thought Tony had just gone off to college at the time since he was the right age for it. 

So this past December I was telling one of my cousins about how I'd tried to find Tony over the past few years just doing some googling/Facebook but couldn't find anything. And she told me the whole story and that Tony had changed his last name. 

After that, it was super easy to find Tony. And it turns out he actually lives in the same state as me, just an hour's drive away! All of our extended family lives thousands of miles away in the area Tony and I were born and raised in. It's a crazy coincidence but I guess not that crazy since it is a much more tolerant area than where we come from. 

So here's the thing. I really want to get in touch with Tony. I wanted find him before because he was a really important person in my childhood, and I (surprise surprise) don't have a great relationship with my parents or the extended family either. But now that I know he was disowned by the family, it feels like it might be selfish to reach out to him just because of my own emotional desires. I know he loved me when I was a kid, but I'm bound to be a reminder of a really traumatizing time in his life. I even have the last name he deliberately chose to leave behind. Ugh. 

I found him on Facebook, so the practical part of it is easy enough. It would be so easy to send him a message. I've just been sitting on this for two months now, arguing myself in circles. On one hand, maybe he'd be happy to find out not everyone in his family hates him for his sexuality, but on the other hand, maybe he's just moved on and doesn't want to open that door again. From what I can tell he seems to be doing well for himself. He looks happy and healthy in what few photos I can see, and he has a good job in a field I remember he was always interested in when I was a kid. We used to watch tv programs about it together. 

So I guess my question is: should I do it? Should I send him a message? And if I do, how can I do it in a way that is respectful to him and what he's gone through?

**tl;dr** I [28F] found out recently that my cousin [40sM] was disowned two decades ago by my family for being gay. I want to contact him, but I think it might be selfish to force him to relive some very painful memories. Should I contact him? Is there a way to do it that is respectful to him and what he's been through?

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [25M] of two years, he didn't celebrate my birthday for the second year in a row.


My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and we are looking to move in together. We've had some rough times with our relationship in the past, but it's been better lately.


Last year, he didn't celebrate my birthday and I was upset. It turned out that birthdays weren't a big thing for his family, and he didn't realise that I wanted to celebrate. We had a talk about expectations, and I told him that for a birthday I would like to go out somewhere to celebrate and to receive a card, and that if he chose to give me a gift I would like it to be wrapped and not presented in the shopping bag. I didn't feel like this was asking a lot.


This year, my birthday fell on the day of a friend's wedding, and my boyfriend was a groomsman. We talked about it in January and decided to celebrate the day after instead. We also talked about plans for celebrating at the wedding with his friends.


The day of my birthday/the wedding I got a nice text message and a 'happy birthday' in person at the wedding. We didn't sit together at the wedding but still had a nice time.


The day after, we were looking at some houses for rent. We had breakfast at a cafe that he chose that I paid for (we were in a hurry and he was in the bathroom). Afterwards, when I asked what his plans for the rest of the day were, he said he was going to the pub with his mates. He also told me he wasn't able to come to my family celebration the next day because he had work to do at home.


I feel really disappointed and hurt that he didn't celebrate with me, and frustrated that nothing has changed since last year. I feel thatI was really clear with my expectations, and that they were ignored. When I asked him why we didn't celebrate, he said he forgot and he was too busy with the wedding, but that's why we chose to postpone the celebration and he still did nothing.
 

How can I help him understand how upset and hurt I am, and how can we get back on track? I tried talking to him about it but he kept steering the conversation back to how bad he felt and how he didn't know what he could do now. He offered to take me out this week but I don't want it to feel like an afterthought and a burden, and would prefer to do nothing.

"I [17M] asked out a guy [17M] at my school but don't think I was clear enough about it being a date... or that I'm gay...


Closeted high school senior here! I'm still working on finding the right time to come out. Even though I think most people will be fine, I'm still scared about a few and what they might think of me. So as far as most people think, I'm straight. I generally act like a straight guy, and no one has ever suspected me of being gay (at least not to my face).

There's another boy at school who's openly gay, and I'll call him Joe. He came out at the beginning of high school, and I've kinda had a crush on him for the past couple years. I really admire him for being able to come out, and he's a really genuinely sweet guy and super fun to be around. My friend group kinda merged with his this past year, so we've started talking more and hanging out with groups of people. It's been great being able to spend time with him, but we're never alone together, and don't hang out one-on-one.

I've been super nervous about it, but I decided that I need to summon the courage to ask him out. I chickened out every time I saw him for like a week straight. Every time I'd have a chance to talk to him alone, I'd get butterflies in my stomach, then inevitably someone else would show up and I'd feel like I couldn't do it any more. 

Finally, yesterday I caught him alone at his locker at the end of the day. I was so nervous, but asked him if he wanted to come chill at my place sometime this week. He said that would be cool, and asked if I was having a few people over from our friend group. I kinda stuttered, but said no, and said that I just thought it would be cool to hang out because I don't think I've ever had him over before. He kinda just said, ""Umm ok,"" and that was that. 

I was so excited! He said yes! Err-- he said ok! But my problem is that the more I think about it, I think I really just asked him to hang out the same way I'd ask a friend I wasn't interested in romantically. I'm afraid that he is just gonna think I'm some boring dude and won't be interested in me. I really want to come out to him and tell him I have a crush on him, but I feel like I kinda asked him out in an awkward way. I wanted to play it cool and let on to the fact that I was asking him on a date without directly saying it.

"I [23F] just found out I am adopted and my brother is making it all about him. Not sure how to move forward.


I was raised in a four-person family. There is my Mom [45F], my Dad [50M], and my brother Jake [25M]. I have grandparents on both sides, in their 60s, and cousins. I look a lot like my family, we all have dark hair, are tall, like sports. I always assumed I was biologically related and it never occurred to me that I was adopted. No one in my family mentioned it until a month ago. 

My Mom says she told me because my biological grandmother contacted her. So, she was afraid I would find out on my own. Which I guess makes sense. 

According to my Mom, it was going to be an open adoption, but then my bio-mom got sick and passed away when I was a year old. My bio-family asked to go no contact and my parents just decided not to tell me. 

Both my parents have said they know it was selfish, they didn’t want to hurt me, they intended to tell me at 18 but I was going to college, then things came up. So they didn’t. And they have apologized, said it was stupid, asked for my forgiveness, and I feel they just didn’t know how to tell me I wasn’t wanted by my biological family.

I am hurt, really hurt, but I don’t intend to cut out my adopted family. They are the only family I know and I feel, deep down, they truly didn’t want to see me hurt. And they were afraid that waiting so long would make it worse. And they were right. It’s just a big mess. 

The biggest issue is my brother Jake [25M] didn’t know either. He has taken it harder than I did, and has been going on rants to me about how he feels like his whole identity is gone. That not knowing I was adopted is something he doesn’t think he can forgive. And it pisses me off. Every time he says it I get madder and madder—not at my parents, but at him. 

It is fucking confusing. I love my brother, he is my closest friend. I love him to the end of the earth and back. *But* it feels like he is making this about him. And it’s not about him. He didn’t find out his birth family rejected him, or that his birth mother is dead. He doesn’t have to deal with changing his whole genetic history or what it means to be a Smith. All the really awesome ancestors I felt close to are now someone else’s ancestors and I know nothing about my birth family, other than a few names. 

I am fucking terrified what this means and he is telling me how he doesn’t know what to do with himself. And I just want to tell him to fuck off. This isn’t about him. He should be supporting me, not the other way around. 

I am just not sure how to tell my brother to back off. 

I know he has a right to be upset. And has a right to never speak to them again if that is how he feels.

I just... 

- I want him to stop telling me how to feel about this. I can keep them in my life if I want and I do want that. 
- I was lied to as well. I am his sister and not being told I am adopted doesn't make him less my brother. But everything I was told about my childhood/past seems like a lie and I must deal with that. I feel he is making this into his hero journey and it pisses me off. 
- I am not sure how to balance all this. I am super confused, super upset, super everything. 

What do I do? How do I even begin to unravel this whole fuckery? 

**TL;DR** Parents lied about my adoption my whole life [for a pretty heavy reason] and now my brother is making it all about him.

"Update: My[18M] brother-in-law[24M],sister[23F] and coworkers[21M&amp;30M] got me ridiculously expensive gifts for no reason. I don't know how to thank them.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5tlqy6/my18m_brotherinlaw24m_sister23f_and/

I decided to write each of them a personal thank you letter. I told them how much each gift meant to me, I got a lot of hugs and my sister cried.

Unfortunately my brother in law cracked his femur. We were fixing the roof of the main sheep barn(part of the roof had collapsed like a week ago due to snow, we moved the sheep as soon as it did) and more of the roof collapsed on him and pinned his leg. Larrys dad(he's subbing for Larry) picked the roof up off of him and I managed to drag him out. Since its cracked and not fractured he didn't need surgery but he'll be in a cast for 10 weeks.

Larrys staying with us since hey might as well keep both of the broken bone pair together. My sister got out of her lease early and is now living here.

"My (19/F) sister's (28/F) photographer boyfriend (25/M) is spreading rumors about me saying I've been trying to sleep with him to further my modeling career.


First, I want to say I've never flirted with him, nor given him any indication that I was at all interested (because I wasn't and I'm still not). That said, when he and my sister hit the five month mark and started dating seriously, and she brought him around to meet the family, she mentioned that he was interested in photographing new people, adding some new faces to his portfolio. He photographs mostly portrait and editorial. He's been published a few times in some magazines, and he's pretty well known in the photography community here, but it's just a hobby for him. As a job he's sous chef at a restaurant downtown. My sister told him I model, so we naturally started talking about photography and our favourite concepts. I had actually heard of him prior to the introduction. He had photographed a model friend of mine a year earlier. She only had good things to say about him at the time. The photos turned out really well.


Fast forward a few weeks. My sister updated her FB relationship status to say that she was in a relationship with him. My model friend knows her, has her added, saw the status change, and  promptly send me a text saying, ""Your sister is dating a creep. Tell her to stay away from that guy."" I was taken aback, so I asked my friend to elaborate and she basically sent me screen shots of hers and this guy's text message conversations. It was professional at first. He would only message her regarding photography, and shoot locations/details, but the more and more they talked, the worse and worse it got. He began hitting on her rather aggressively, saying things like, ""My dick gets hard when I look at your raws."" By 'raws' he means raw, unedited images. Nasty. Anyway, my friend was *a little receptive* to his behaviour when he was just complimenting her bone structure and whatnot, but as soon as he got into boner territory, she kindly asked him to stop, and he did ... until a month after he and my sister got together. He apparently messaged my friend after that and asked if she wanted to grab drinks. They hadn't been speaking for months by this point, so she was thrown off and disgusted, and she told him no. He backed off. 


They had never grabbed drinks before that, so he definitely wasn't asking as a friend. He was trying to hook up with her, while in a relationship with my sister, and who knows how many other models he's been hitting on and potentially sleeping with, behind my sister's back. 


I showed my sister the screenshots. At first she was shocked, grossed out and thankful towards my friend and I, said she was going to dump him, etc., but then a couple of days later, she sent me this long message basically calling me for trying to fuck up her relationship because I'm 'jealous' and 'desperate' for attention. It came out of nowhere, and she sent me screenshots of mine and her boyfriend's FB messages regarding photography. It was professional. He kept it professional. I kept it professional. We only discussed shoots, and our favourite locations, and my sister *knew* we talked about that stuff. She wasn't unaware of it. She would sometimes chime in saying he should photograph me. So for her to bring up those conversations as if I was trying to steal her boyfriend, noooooo. She said he told her I've been hitting on him, but it was always in person so there was no hard evidence of it. Never happened. The only times I've seen him in person is when she's there, too. I've never seen him privately. I've never hit on him, not even slightly. That's gross. 


So now I don't know what to do. They're both trying to turn people against me. I model full time. It's my job. It's how I pay for school and my apartment. If she wants to delude herself into thinking her cheating boyfriend is telling the truth, then that's her right, and she'll one day realize how wrong she is, but I already know they're whispering about me to people in the photography and modeling community. He's probably doing it to cover his ass, and she's probably going along with it because she loves him and feels backed into a corner. 


What should I do? 


**tl;dr** She believes him. I don't know what to do. On s personal level I know there's nothing I can do to prove to her that he's making it up. She has to come to that conclusion on her own but his bs is hurting my career now. They're trying to damage my reputation as a model, and it's so infuriating. How do I recover from this? "

"Is it okay to ask the guy [M27] that I [F25] am seeing to take me to a different restaurant for my birthday than he suggested, or will I seem like a brat?


Hi there! This is a pretty minor problem in the grand scheme of things on this sub, but it'd be nice to get feedback.

I've been dating a guy for a couple months, and he's funny and wonderful and it's all been great. Today is my birthday and he has asked to take me out for dinner tomorrow, saying he can't wait to spoil me. This sounds like he will be paying, which he does often but I take him on dates and pay for them too, or pay half for dinner a fair amount of the time.

He said it'd be easier to go out near his house, and I agreed. He said ""I'll make a reservation at the chinese place!"" and I said yes in the moment. Now this sounds incredibly petty but I really don't fancy chinese food for my birthday. This place is somewhere we talked about trying but I have a weird steak-on-my-birthday tradition and I just really fancy it. Is it rude to ask if we can go to a steak place? I've looked up the restaurants nearby the prices would work out the same, and I'd be happy to pay for half, but I know he won't let me. I don't want to seem like I'm just nagging or trying to get a nice dinner off him!

Should I suggest going for different food or just be quiet and appreciate the nice date?

I text Sam and asked if he hadn't made a reservation yet how would he feel about going for a steak instead? He said something along the lines of ""Of course! It's your birthday, I want to do whatever you want to do! There's a great steak place called blah blah..."" so he's still lovely and fantastic and I'm an idiot and you guys are all great. Thanks!**"

"I [30f] am having a disagreement with my boyfriend [30M] of 4 years about his appearance.


My boyfriend is one of the hardest working people I know, but based on the way he presents himself, you might think upon first meeting him that he is a lazy slob. 

He has shoulderlength brown hair and a scraggly reddish beard. 90% of his wardrobe is jeans and funny t-shirts. He has a couple of polos that I bought for him, and his work shirts. No slacks or khakis or anything.

For the majority of our relationship, I have overlooked this, because I know what a great person he is. However, a few things have happened over the past couple of years that have made it more of an issue, and we are now in a heated debate

* He wore jeans to my sister's wedding. Everyone let it slide because I told them it was all he had, but I did get a few nasty comments and he was not allowed to be with me in any photos. It was embarrassing.

* He recently missed out on a promotion at work. He asked his friend who knew the interviewer for some insight as to why. They said, verbatim, ""if he had worn a cleaner looking shirt and at least bothered to iron it, it would have gone a long way"". (He had worn a very wrinkled polo, and he and I had a fight about it before he left because I begged him to let me press it and he wouldn't.) I was embarrassed FOR him when I heard this feedback. He didn't seem bothered at all.

After the promotion thing we started to talk about it more, but he always gets extremely defensive and shuts me down for ""being ashamed of him."" I always feel really bad and I don't know what to say. He feels that because he is ""not in business"" and ""not customer facing"" (he works in a warehouse), his appearance doesn't matter. 

The truth is, I'm not ashamed of him. I love him. **But I am ashamed of the way he presents himself sometimes.**

He has never really been a sharp dresser, but when we first met he was much better about keeping his hair and beard cut. This has sort of phased out and he now gets a haircut about once a year.

The reason this has become such a hot topic lately is that I recently got promoted at my job. It is a higher level, corporate job and I consistently have to maintain a neatly groomed and well dressed appearance. As a result, we look like the odd couple out in public. That's not what's bothering me, though. What's bothering me is that when I inevitably bring him along to some work functions, I don't want to have to be ashamed of his appearance. **Appearances are very important at my job, and I don't want to feel like I need to hide my SO from my boss and coworkers.** 

Does this make me shallow? Am I wrong to expect him to at least perform the bare minimum of personal maintenance, to trim his hair and beard every few weeks, to at least own one necktie and a pair of slacks? I'm not asking him to dress to the nines every single day...I just would like him to dress up if the situation warrants it, like a job interview or a wedding or one of my work events.

When we first met in our mid 20s, this wasn't a huge deal, but now that we are 30 and I feel like we both need to stop dressing like we are teenagers. 

***TL;DR: I wish my boyfriend would cut his hair/beard and dress nice sometimes. He accuses me of being ashamed of him and not loving him for who he is when I bring it up. What do I do?!***"
"I [18F] met someone new [30F], who desperately wants to be friends with me. I don't want to be her friend, and I'm not sure how to say something.

"My (26/M) roommate's girlfriend (32/F) has been staying with us for free, eating my food, and has recently tricked my roommate (28/M) into buying her designer bags that he can't afford, with the money that I loaned him.


She was cool at first, but as soon as she lost her job, she turned into a complete nightmare. First of all, I said it was okay for her to stay with us *temporarily* as she couldn't afford rent for her place anymore and we had the room to spare. We decided one month was a good enough period of time for her to find another job, and start looking for a cheaper apartment in a different area of the city. 

It's been three months.

Over the course of the past three months, she's been at home 90% of the time, watching Netflix, *not* looking for a job or a new place, and she's been eating my food on top of everything. I'm okay with people using my stuff as long as they ask, but she outright just opens bottles of wine, uses 5/12 eggs to make an omelette, leaves bread out in the open all day making so that I come home after work to find the bread stale, half of my groceries gone, alongside other petty, avoidable situations. I've spoken to her and my roommate about this separately and together, and they explained that she just doesn't know what's mine and what's his, but that's beside the point. She's being a bad roommate. Point blank. Even if they were his groceries, have some respect for your SO's hard earned money. Don't leave things out. Act like the 30-something you are. Obviously I communicate those sentiments in a nicer way, but that's she gist.

Recently she *has* been looking for her own place, which is a good step, and she hasn't been up to her usual antics but my roommate took a massive pay cut at work and he needed some extra to pay for his car, and his mother's hospital bills, so I told him I'd lend him the money. It was three thousand. Nothing life-changing, just enough to get him back on his feet for the time being. Come to find out, his girlfriend has been toting around two new designer bags that she can't afford. My girlfriend came over, made nice with her as she usually does, and casually asked if she got those bags for Christmas. Turns out she didn't. They were from my roommate, and he bought them for her to make her feel better because she didn't crush the job interview she had been gearing up towards. I want to emphasize that this girl is prettier than most other girls my roommate has dated. He's an average looking guy, so I'm guessing he's enduring her bs because he feels he can't do any better. That's his choice. But even the mere chance that he used the money I loaned him to pay for her consolation gift ... no, that won't fly. 


I asked my roommate about it, and he tried to deny it at first, but he eventually owned up to it and said that she kind of backed him into a corner. He feels like he can't break up with her now because she relies on him too much. I get that, but he really didn't have to buy her the bags. So either he's making excuses or she's pulling the strings. Either way I'm tired of it and I'm worried for my friend. I want to have one final talk with him about losing this girl before I make any drastic decisions like moving out. What should I say? I've known him since we were in our first year of uni. He's a good friend. He's normally not like this at all. I don't want to shift all the blame on his SO, but he genuinely wasn't acting like this until he met her. 


TL;DR - I want to have one final talk with him about this before I start looking for another apartment/roommate. He's a good friend. We've known each other for years. I don't want to see him go down this path, and I do think he realizes how toxic she is as a person, but he's a little insecure when it comes to dating, and this girl is easily the prettiest he's ever dated. Personally I'm done with both of them if this persists. "

"My ex [35M] didn't tell me [31F] or our children [4M, 6M] that his new girlfriend was moving in with him. The kids don't like her and i'm being blamed for it.


My ex-husband and I broke up 2 years ago after I found out he was cheating on me. We have two kids now aged 6 and 8 who live with me and they visit their dad once a week and then stay with him every other weekend. Our break-up/divorce was messy and now we don’t talk to each other unless it is about the kids. 


His new girlfriend moved in with him a couple months ago. I didn’t even know that he had a girlfriend and he never told me that she was moving in.  He also didn’t tell the kids – they only found out when they went to stay and they were the ones to tell me. I admit, I was not happy that my kids were now staying with someone who I didn’t know at all but I have spent so much of my energy the last two years fighting with him. So I told him I wish that he had told me about her and then I left it at that.


The boys were supposed to be going this weekend and they really didn’t want to go. They told me it was because it was they don’t like her. They say she is bossy and mean and makes their dad less fun. I know kids exaggerate and she is probably not *that* bad but It has got to be hard for them to suddenly be around this woman all the time who they don’t know. I also know our oldest still was hoping we would get back together so that must be hard – facing the reality that it isn’t going to happen.


Yesterday, when he came to pick them up they told him they didn’t want to go and they told him why. This led to a huge argument in which he blamed ME for encouraging the kids to dislike her because I was jealous. I’ve never said anything about her to the kids and I try to ignore their moaning. I’ve also never even met her so I don’t even have an opinion on her. 


I managed to make the boys go but according to my ex’s messages they have been badly behaved and it’s all my fault. I then got a message from his girlfriend this morning asking me why I hated her so much when she has been so nice to the kids. I’m so tempted to reply something bitchy but I’m trying to rise above it all but I feel like I’m being attacked for no reason. The kids are misbehaving because the last 2 years have been rough for them anyway and they were just getting settled and now they have another big change that they knew nothing about.

Ok, this is mostly a rant but any advice would be useful. Do I reply and tell them exactly how I feel, that yes I’m not happy at the situation but it is not my fault? Or just stay quiet and hope things settle down? For me, this is so frustrating because it feels like our break-up is never ending.

"I [29F] was told by my bf [25M] (dating for 1 yr now) that he invited one of my colleagues [25F] over at his place so that he could brew her a cup of coffee on her b'day


Backstory: we don't live together. Once, last year, we happened to go watch a movie with two female colleagues who work in my department. He's from a different department and I introduced him as a friend.

Fast-fwd, he tells me today: he found out that one of these colleagues (his age and female) goes to the campus cafeteria at the same time as he does and he ends up talking to her on a regular basis. He says he enjoys her company. He tells me that it's her b'day tomorrow and he's invited her over to brew her a cup of coffee. I am in the same department as her and even I didn't know that it's her b'day tomorrow! Should I be worried?

She doesn't know that we are dating. Wouldn't somebody in her shoes take this the wrong way? As him asking her out for a cup of coffee? Especially after he's been bumping into her almost every day around lunch time? Or am I overthinking here? Am I being just insecure that he's found another girl whom he likes who happens to be younger than I? Any advice would be deeply appreciated. 

TL;DR: bf invited a female colleague over for coffee at his place on her b'day, tells me he talks to her regularly and likes her company. I feel that he's leading her on. And oh yeah, she's younger than I am. Please advice how to take this.

[edit1: I forgot to mention that I had already told him that she's just a colleague and not a friend. She is part of a group that I prefer not to hangout with. We just happened to go to a movie together once. That's all.]

[edit2: I told him about my feelings. He said he just wants to be friends with her. And that I shouldn't think more of it. He will let her know that he's in a relationship. Thanks for ur advice Reddit!]

[update: we broke up. Before u assume the worst, he did see how what he did could have been misleading. He changed the plans to brewing her a cup of coffee at his department later this week. But he said he doesn't want to do this relationship anymore because of my insecurities and how I overthought things :'( I plead guilty. When I told him that there should be some boundaries that shouldn't be crossed in a relationship, he said that it felt like I didn't want him to have any gal pals while I was just trying to ensure that he doesn't lead any other girl on  :'( if after 1 yr he felt that way, that I didn't have my best intentions at heart, I guess we are better off without each other. Bottom line: we had different expectations out of this relationship. Thanks for all your advice and support through this. It hurts like hell. So I am going to cry myself to sleep tonight. To be fair to him, he did tell me at the beginning of our relationship that he doesn't do relationships but that he was willing to give it a shot for me. So I don't blame him if he thinks this was unbearable. We gave it a shot. We are walking away from this with great memories. But he's back to being aversive to relationships and I think so am I. I feel horrible about that! I was the older one in this relationship here and I left him with an impression that relationships are not worth the effort! I let us down. Sigh. I just hope we go on to be better people. Let's get better, coz we are not dead yet!]

My thoughts now: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5waq8b/comment/deawzn1?st=IZOVMJOB&amp;sh=7e15dbf6

Thanks a lot all of you for sharing your perspectives. Means a lot to me! This being my first post, I now know for myself why Reddit is what it is. A great community! Dif-tor heh smusma! "
"Me [26/F] with husband [28/M] married 1 year, he's changed his mind on kids and I don't know if this should be a deal breaker


Before we got married I was fully honest about the fact that I wanted kids and he told me he wanted to have kids with me. He already has a 5 year old with someone else. Well after we got married I got pregnant and we both decided it was just terrible timing due to financial and relationship issues we were having, so I went through with an abortion. Even then he told me we would try again once we got in a better spot. We're still not in any position to bring another life into this world but last night he dropped the bomb on me that he didn't want any more kids, and that I pretty much had to agree that our relationship was going to be childless. It was a surprise given the fact that he previously said he did want more kids. Now he's saying he didn't even want kids when he had the first one and he definitely doesn't want any more. I don't know what to do, I'm angry he lied to me before marriage and now we're married he has different wants. Had I known this before I wouldn't have married him. Is this a deal breaker or am I supposed to just accept this?

Tl;dr husband changed his stance on wanting kids and I'm not sure if it should be a deal breaker. "
"Me (21F) with a guy I met online (26M). He said something alarming. Should I cut it off?


Hopefully you can provide me with some advice. I've been talking with this guy from POF for a few weeks now. He seemed like a good match for me up until this evening. 

Necessary context: I am a recovering addict. This is my first attempt at dating since I've been in recovery, so I wasn't sure when I should bring this up to him. He knows I am in drug court for pot possession and that I go to recovery meetings. I intended to tell him I am an addict when we met for the first time. (we haven't met yet)

After telling him I was at a step workshop all day, he asked me if it was for drug court or if I have a legitamate problem. I told him the truth, and he asked a few harmless questions--how long I'd been clean, what I used, if I'd ever relapsed etc. I answered truthfully. Then he hit me with this: 

""Okay good, thank you for telling me. I'm glad you have. As long as you know if we take our relationship to the next level I will not tolerate any using or hanging around users specially men. Also if we go to the next level I will expect full honesty about everything. *We can play it by ear but it might be worth considering our relationship being strict dominate so that your behaviors don't get out of line and if they do I can address them.*""

The last part is what really screams ""red flag"" to me. I told him he sounded controlling and that I was offended. He apologized saying that wasn't the best wording and told me to forget it. 

I guess what I'm asking is, is this an appropriate response? Could he just be clueless about addiction and think answering to him would help me stay sober, or is this guy a controlling nut job? Should I continue and see how it progresses (on high alert for other red flags), or should I just dip now? 

**TL;DR** guy I'm interested in said something controlling. Should I see how it goes or dip now? "
