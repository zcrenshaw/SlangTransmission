"[Update] My sister [23f] thinks that marrying her bf [27m] and having kids with him will make their relationship ""spark up"" again. How do I [14f] tell her this is a bad idea?


Hey again.

Link to the op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5d299h/my_sister_23f_thinks_that_marrying_her_bf_27m_and/

Just wanted to say that my sister and her boyfriend decided to break up. And also that she's not getting pregnant and marrying him anymore. As some people advised me, I called my brother and asked him to help me. He came over on Thursday and had a serious talk with her. 

He told her to think about the future. Don't think about right now. Think about your life in 10, 20, 30 years. Kids won't fix a broken relationship and heartbreak isn't the worst thing in the world, she doesn't own anything to that guy, but years down the line if she decides to marry him, she'll have to deal with her awful relationship and take care of other human beings with him.

At first she couldn't accept it but after thinking about it, she decided that they should break up. Her boyfriend didn't seem upset at all and even though she's sad now, she'll get better and keep focusing on her education, which is important.

Now I have to deal with my crazy family. My oldest brother from Europe is coming over on Thanksgiving... wish me luck. Haha

But thank you so much for helping me! People here are awesome (sometimes). :)

tl;dr: My sister broke up with her boyfriend and decided to keep going to college"
"I [59 M] recently lost my son [26] and don't know how to deal with potential speakers at the funeral (Update)


**Update** I'd like to thank everyone for all of the kind words and incredible advice that they have sent through both threads. I have not been able to respond to everyone, but please be assured that I have read every one of your comments, and I appreciate them all. Everyone is doing well on our end, and while the pain is still immense, sharing memories ad photos with his friends has helped a lot. I'm so proud of him and everything he did in his short time with us.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cuvee/i_59_m_recently_lost_my_son_26_and_dont_know_how/

 
I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my first thread. Your words were so kind and helped me out with a difficult situation. I'd also like to offer an apology, as I feel I misstated some things in my original post. My difficulty was not from finding out what kind of person my son was just before his death. Additionally, I got lots of posts giving advice to the likes of ""I would let them speak,"" which baffled me slightly, as I hadn't thought that that's what I was asking. I had never considered keeping them out of the funeral and letting them speak their words, however when I re-read my original post, I can see how I didn't make it clear that I was already working with them on delivering their speeches. For this lack of clarity, I sincerely apologize. However, I read all of the comments in full, and I greatly appreciate everyone's input.

To update, the funeral took place yesterday was was, perhaps fittingly, a weirdly wonderful affair. My wife his, younger sister and I spoke, as did 4 of his friends. We decided to hold the funeral in his adopted city rather than here for 2 reasons: First was because we all know he loved that city so much, and Second was to make it easier for his friends to attend. (I should state, pretty much everyone in our hometown was in a position to travel, but his friends aren't, as they are students and it's midterm season for them.) Although people had reached out to me, I was stunned by turnout. I didn't get a proper headcount, but the room that I though was relatively large was down to standing room only.


The family's speeches and 3 of his friends were relatively normal for a funeral, and recounted fond memories of his life and personality. The 4th friend to speak was not.

Quite simply, he wanted to roast my son, namely in the style of a comedy central roast. When he pitched the idea to me, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give him his moment. Part of it was one of the few aspects of my son that remained constant throughout his life: he hated tradition for tradition's sake. He was always someone who would question (sometimes at unfortunately inappropriate times) why everything is the way it is. Think along the lines of ""Why is the bride supposed to wear white?"" while acutaly at a wedding. A second part of my decision to allow it was because a common theme I found out through his friends was that he was quite a joker himself towards the end, and would do anything for a laugh, going as far as making himself the butt of the joke just to get a positive reaction from them. Finally, I agreed because he was completely upfront with me about what he wanted to say (he handed me his script) and said that if I was uncomfortable with it or the idea, that he would still be honoured if he could give a more traditional speech. 

This led me to the one difficult in the funeral, namely, where do I put this joker? Do I do it at the beginning to set a tone, or at the end to leave on a high? I discussed with my wife and his friend, and we agreed on a compromise, where he would give a short talk at the beginning to set the mood that wouldn't be all sad, and then he delivered his main set at the end, so we could all leave without tears in our eyes.

So, as weird as it might sound, I think we all had fun at the funeral, and I was incredibly touched to have met so many of his friends. While I still sort of feel that I' mourning 2 people, I was so proud that my son broke out of his shell when he left. I know his friends are wonderful people, and I can only imagine how happy my son was up to the end.

"[UPDATE] to post from 2+ months ago: ""Me [34f] with my husband [40m] married 11 years w/ 2 kids: I told him I want to leave, but then he surprised me.""


[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50tf15/me_34f_with_my_husband_40m_married_11_years_w_2/)

It's been about 10 weeks since my post. Here's what happened. 

The evening after I made that post, I told my husband there is no way we will be able to work everything out on our own, and we need to go to counseling. He reluctantly agreed. 

We started couples counseling the very next week. It's realy quite strange how counseling has progressed. 

1. My husband made one change - stopping with the yelling - immediately and totally. He hasn't yelled at me over little things for weeks now. 

2. BUT I have progressively gotten more and more angry with, disappointed in, and disconnected from him because of everything he's said and done during these weeks in counseling.... which also caused me to sort of wake up to all that he has done in the past. I have an appointment with a lawyer next week. We are done. 

\#2 takes a bit of explanation, so here goes. 

I am quite stunned by how little effort this guy is willing to put into the relationship in spite of so desperately wanting to hold on to it. So he made one change - the end of all yelling. I was really, really relieved and grateful and impressed.... until he started complaining (about 4 days in!) that he was putting in all the effort and seeing ""negative returns"". This has remained his stance for all these 10-11 weeks. 

I am flabbergasted. Our couples counselor has straight up said to him: ""I am supposed to be neutral here but on this I am comfortable saying you are WRONG, she is making a huge effort at this relationship and you need to know that."" But in private my husband dismisses everything I'm doing as ""intangible"" or ""selfish"" and therefore not real. And he complains nonstop that I'm not my ""usual self"" i.e. the doormat who danced around managing his feelings and walking on eggshells all the time. ""This is not the person I fell in love with,"" he keeps saying. ""Why should I bother making all this effort?"" 


For my part, yes, I am not the person he fell in love with. The couples counselor told me to stop trying to manage his feelings for him and try to be myself - and I took that very seriously. I no longer try to read his mood all the time and tiptoe around him. I no longer try to intuit when he is angry or hurt and ask him what's wrong and try to cajole him into working things out. I leave it to him to bring it up with me if something is bothering him. If he's in a bad mood and sulking, I just leave him alone and go on with my own thing until he wants to talk. If he is stonewalling me, which he has started doing for a few days after every single counseling session, I no longer let it affect my mood. This seems to be making him feel completely unloved and abandoned - which I only know because he has broken down and cried and yelled at me after the stonewall. ""You don't care about me anymore."" And I've been saying, ""If something is bothering you, you need to tell me. I won't read your mind. And I won't cave to your freezeouts."" Cue his standard line, ""What effort are you making in this relationship? Why am I the only one who's doing anything here? Why should I continue to do this work when you are being so selfish?"" 

The stoppage of yelling was homework from the very first session. He did that. But subsequent sessions' homework has been things like, ""Go on a date this week"" and ""Make one show of affection as soon as you're home from work"" and ""Make time for conversation before bedtime"" etc. -- all of which have been spectacular failures. On our ""date"" he refused to so much as hold my hand and spent all his time wandering off on his own (we were at a museum) - and when I brought it up later he got massively pissed saying ""WE WENT ON A DATE WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT"".  The  show of affection - well, he used to do it if he came home later than me, but if I come home from work later than him, he is always distracted and does not reciprocate my hug *even after I point it out*, and now since he started stonewalling me for days after each counseling session, I haven't even tried to do this homework because fuck it, who wants to hug a stonewaller (same goes for conversation before bedtime). 

This shit has really woken me up, y'all. I don't know what sort of fantasy I had constructed out of whole cloth that made me love this guy. He really doesn't want to lift a finger. He seems to lose it completely at the thought of my leaving - cries, seems desperate - but it translates into ZERO action. He really doesn't care about me at all. 

Anyway - I said as much to him early this week and told him I am leaving. Next week I have an appointment with an attorney to see what my options are. This shit is really happening. I am leaving. I am scared as shit and my emotions are fucking fried but I have never been more sure of anything.

  **tl;dr**: 10 weeks of actually talking about our relationship for the first time in 11 years - that's all it took to wake me up to the reality that I married a ridiculously selfish man. Fuck. :(

Here I am again with good news. 

I went back to the pub and told the manager ""yo I really need that surveillance footage mate. My buddy's girlfriend was making out with another guy and you need to help me, ya know?"" 

He of course agreed and asked me on a date afterwards - I'm taken so I obviously said no, but I did show the footage to my friend who dumped his girlfriend.

Just kidding. I went back to the pub and politetly asked the manager for footage of that night. He agreed to show me (!!!!!!!!!!) and then I showed it to my friend. I left a really big tip and I wanna give a shout out to u/reelniggaonehunna for the idea. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!

My friend was devastated, of course. He had been dating Candice for 8 years. But he said ""I knew you weren't lying, I just couldn't accept it"". He also apologized deeply for bringing up my sexuality and after a long talk, I decided to forgive him because I understand that he was in a bad place. He dumped his gf. 

Thanks for all the advice, r/relationships. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

"I [29F] took in my intellectually disabled sister [23F]. Parents accuse me of ""stealing their daughter"".


My sister was born with a severe intellectual disability. This caused a big strain on our family while I was growing up. At some point my parents gave up on her and decided that she just can't be helped anymore, despite the fact that doctors thought otherwise. After she turned 18 my parents tried to petition the courts to continue be her guardian but they weren't successful.

When she turned 19 I took her in with me and put her back under professional mental health care. She lived with me but spent a lot of time working with doctors, psychologists and various types of therapists to develop further. She wasn't growing to gain complete independence but that didn't mean she had no room for improvement. They helped her a lot. Last year she was able to get a simple part time job and she's held onto it until now, something our parents always believed is impossible. These past four years she's improved so much that she's a totally new person. She's still intellectually disabled and can't live independently but she's miles better than when she was with our parents, and miles happier.

This year I was able to obtain guardianship over her as that helps a lot with my involvement in her healthcare and finances. Before this, my parents always told me that I'm wasting my time with her. Now after they learned about the guardianship, they became incredibly upset and offended and they started to tell me how I stole my sister from them and I have no right to do what I'm doing and things like that. They've been trying to contact her to manipulate her I guess which I have so far blocked. This is all drama that my sister will not understand and does not need. But I suspect my parents aren't going to stop. They're some of the most stubborn people I've ever known.

So I guess I'm looking for advice as to how to deal with them without letting it affect my sister.

His family usually drives a few hours away and at the beach for a few nights. I was planning on going until my boyfriend told me that it would be best if I didn't go because of how his extended family might react to him bringing a girl.

He said he's been doing thanksgiving with them since he was a kid and that it would be weird if I came because it would mean our relationship is very serious. He said they might even ask him if we plan on getting married or having kid or something weird like that.

I already know his grandma, dad, brother and step mom, and they are not like that at all. However, he says that many of his cousins are married really young and have children. I am very hurt because I was looking forward to Thanksgiving this year, but now I am going to be alone. His family wants me to go, but not him. I don't know what to think of this.

"My roommate's [29M] girlfriend [2?f] told me [22F] to dry my clothes somewhere where my roommate can't see them, bc it makes him uncomfortable. Help?


I've been living with my roommate Marco since January. We met on Craigslist and we're good friends/roommates, but not bffs. We hang out when we're both at home but are good with respecting each others space and bringing up household issues when the need arises.

Our apartment is loft-style, and has two floors. On the upper floor there's my room and the main bathroom/washer and dryer, downstairs there's Marco's room and the kitchen and living room. For as long as I've lived here, Marco and I have both used the railing on the upper floor to air dry our laundry. I usually only put things that shouldn't be machine dried (sweaters, cheap f21 shit, bras, etc) on the railing, and use the dryer for everything else. The clothes on the railing are usually left overnight and then put away in the morning.

Marco has been seeing this girl Tiffany for a few months now - I've only actually met her a handful of times, but from what I've seen he seems really happy with her.

Last night however, Marco and her came in when I was doing laundry, and I came downstairs to say hi. When I went back upstairs to put another load in, Tiffany followed me into the bathroom and shut the door. She then said ""I didn't want to say anything about this, but it makes Marco really uncomfortable that you hang out your lingerie for all the world to see. It's really inappropriate and you should keep them in your room."" I kind of awkwardly apologized (I know) and she left, and didn't say anything to me for the rest of the night. 

Now that I've had time to reflect on what she said, I'm thinking that was super weird and inappropriate. Besides the fact that the only things drying when she came over were ratty sport bras and wool socks, she has no right to tell me where I can hang my clothes. No idea if Marco actually feels uncomfortable (he probably would've mentioned it outright, though he dries his boxers on the railing too so idk if he'd have a leg to stand on) but I don't know how to deal with this when I see Tiffany next. Do I just ignore her? Say ""thanks, but I live here and I can dry my clothes wherever I like""? Bring this up to Marco? Please help.

"UPDATE: Me [25F] with my best friend [29F] and her boyfriend [27M]: She thinks she's getting engaged, but I doubt it. I'm supposed to help her boyfriend plan a proposal. Should I reach out to him?


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cxk2c/me_25f_with_my_best_friend_29f_and_her_boyfriend/

*TLDR of my original- My friend thinks a proposal is imminent. She also thought that last year, but it turned out that no and they had a huge fight. Should I tell her boyfriend she's expecting a proposal again this year?*

**Update:** I'm really appreciative of all the feedback I received. A lot of people told me to butt out, some people told me to contact my best friend's boyfriend. That's the road I chose. 

And it turns out he actually IS proposing to her!!!!!! I'm so relieved. He said he was just about to contact me. He said he's planning on proposing in less than a month's time, although he doesn't have the ring or a plan. But he has gotten the contact info of the aunt to try and get the ring, so that's a good step, and he asked my ideas for a holiday proposal. Although he said he might put of a holiday proposal since he has a conference he has to go to over the holidays. BUT he said yes, he's actually going to do it. 

Like I said, I'm very relieved. I know for a long time my friend has really wanted their relationship to progress to marriage (she told me maybe a month back that if he didn't propose soon she was just going to book her dream location and give him an ultimatum). Do I think they should get married? No. Do I think there's a chance they still might not get married? Yes. But that is truly not my business, this is my friend's decision to make, and I'm just going to be happy for her as long as she's happy.

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vs1q3/my_25f_boyfriend_28m_of_3_years_wants_me_to_plan/)

Hi guys, well I got so much support and encouragement on my original post I really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me. It took a few months and a lot of tearful pleas on my part (not proud of that) and frustration on his, but I am moving back across the country by myself. 


I wanted to give it one last go, to tell him that I needed him to put more effort into the ""emotional labor"" in our relationship instead of me just doing everything and him showing up. He definitively told me that he did not have the energy or inclination to do that because he is working too much; that it wasn't forever but if I wasn't happy I was free to leave. I tried to stick it out but his work hours got longer and longer, he signed up for a sport on the one weekend day he didn't work, and I was just getting more lonely, resentful and miserable by the day. 


I finally just snapped, and agreed that I needed to go. He was pretty shocked to say the least, I believe his words were ""*wow, I didn't think you'd ever actually leave me*"", but he was supportive overall. He wants me to be happy, and I know he loves me very much, perhaps just not as much as he loves himself and his career. He is being friendly while I have to stay over here for a few weeks, and helping me move back across the country at the start of next month. 


I'm sad that I'm losing my best friend, partner and the future we had started to build, but I know it's the right decision. I'm scared to move back by myself, I feel like a bit of a failure, but I'm glad it ended now while I'm still relatively young. Plus, I'll only have to plan, book and organise things for myself from now on :)

"My [20 F] boyfriend [24 M] invited some other girl instead to his family home for thanksgiving


My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for only about 5 months. Brian is really kind, cute, and we have a lot of common interests! I meet him on campus and we dated and instantly connected. I was definitely smitten. Then I learned that I had been accepted into Medical School in another city. We both committed to trying out a long distance relationship. I am currently living a few hours away from where he is working on completing his undergrad studies in arts.

Medical school have been really a shit ton of work. Please excuse my language. I hadn't quite expected the challenge since I always managed to cruise through undergrad with plenty of free time for all the extracurriculars I wanted. Brian and I have talked a few times on the phone and Skyped, but probably not nearly as much as we should have. My classmates in LDRs are also in the boat.

Brian and I had a call a weekend before thanksgiving. His family home is half way between my med school city and his undergrad campus. We talked about a lot of fun things that were happening and he asked about my thanksgiving plans. I told him that I was going to spend thanksgiving by myself in my new city because train tickets back to my family home was too expensive at this time. It was only practical. I asked what he had planned for thanksgiving. So it turned out the reason he's been sounding distracted (and the reason that he may have initiated the call in the first place that night) was because he told me he invited a good uni friend of his (lets call her Rowan) over to his home for thanksgiving. Immediately I was all like ? because I know Brian lived in a small town, and his thanksgiving celebrations with his family was a pretty small and private affair. In fact that was the reason why I didn't even expect to be invited (in addition to the fact that we haven't been dating long). Brain told me Rowan had just returned from an exchange trip overseas and was looking for a place to stay over thanksgiving weekend, so he offered to look after her.

The thing is, Rowan and I are not strangers. We were on the rugby team together two years ago. If Rowan was looking for a place to stay she could have stayed with her parents or siblings or any of the girls on the team because everyone was tight. I found it really weird how quickly Brian offered a spot for her in his family home, especially since his parents don't know her. But I honestly appreciate him being open with me that he invited her. 

But I still felt a little strange. I have a lot of questions. I wish Brian texted or called me first before inviting a girl over. I wish I could have spent thanksgiving with Brian. It just feels so weird that the only guest his parents had in their home was a girl that Brian brought from university. But that girl wasn't his girl friend. I was in fact in another city spending thanksgiving by myself. 

 BTW we live in Canada so this has all already happened. I didn't know what to say so I just told Brian I thought it was kind of him to help her out like that. I am posting now because because I am hoping someone can help sort out if I over or under reacted to the situation and if there is anything I can do to make it right.

Been married 12 years and we've been together for 15.  I have never been unclear about not wanting kids since day 1, and she whole heartedly agreed.    It was actually one of the things that helped us bond at the beginning.  She grew up the younger sister of a severely disabled brother, and was basically forced to be a caretaker for as long as she can remember.

Earlier this year she made some comments about ""if we had kids"" and we laughed it off, but then the comments started happening more frequently.  She finally told me she has had a change of heart and wants them now, before we are too old.  Well, I have not had a change of heart.  In fact, I'm more against the idea than ever before for many reasons.  

I don't blame her, and I'm not mad at her for it, but I am at a total loss of words.  Our marriage is great, our house is almost paid off, our plan to save as much as possible, retire early, and travel around the planet is currently 2 years ahead of schedule.  Everything is/was going so well!

The idea of divorce seems so crazy, but I feel like she has put me in control of her destiny.  If I deny her, then she will resent me forever.  If we divorce, she'll be sent out into the dating pool as a 36 year old woman looking for someone to start a new life and family with.  I'd assume (hope) that would add a few more years into the equation, if not more unless she was just looking for a sperm donor.

Hi everyone! i hope this is the right place to post and that i end up getting a couple o replies...
... I am 15 years old and was just adopted. i've been living with the family for like a week now.everything is just so awkward. i don't feel like i fit in anywhere or into the family. its not that alicia or matt (my new parents) are mean or uncaring. they have been super nice and helpful and are pretty awesome but i don't know. i feel like i don't deserve being here. i feel like i don't deserve the early gifts we got for christmas but my adopted brothers and sisters do. does that make sense? i hate using things are causing too much trouble. like i don't want to do anything wrong or like be using the TV when someone else might want to or something like that. this all seems really dumb writing out but i don't know how else to explain it. i just feel like it can't be possible for me to ever actually become as equal to their biological children or that the other kids will see me as an actual sibling. i don't know what to do or how to bring this up with my new parents. they said i can talk to them about anything i feel like but i'm scared because i don't want them to think that they are not doing a good job or that i don't want to be here. i am super grateful for them , more than i can ever tell them.

edit: wow so many replies! everyone is so caring in their comments and i really appreciate you all taking the time to reply:) . it seems that i should talk  to my parents about this and that they would want to hear about how i'm feeling. i think i'll ask them if we can sit and talk tonight after dinner or something. in the mean time i tried to be more open and friendly with my siblings. i asked my older brother if he wanted to watch this movie on netflix with me. we had fun and made popcorn . we ended up not really watching the movie much and just talking/getting to know each other. my  older sister got home mid way through the movie and joined us on the couch and it was actually fun. we laughed a lot and they both are very nice and cool!i guess a lot of these feelings i have are inside my head and not really as big of problem . i think i'm just super nervous of doing something wrong but i think i'll be okay. i think my talk with my parents will go well too-i'm already feeling much better especially reading all these comments. it was especially nice to read the stories of people who have or have been adopted. its nice to see i'm not as alone as i thought:)

"My(F26) husband(M29) is going to fire my sister's(F27) husband(M33) tomorrow. How do I talk to her?


My husband helped my sister's husband get a job.  My sister's husband unleashed some racial slurs at another employee.  Human resources department has investigated.  He admitted to it.   Now my husband has to fire him.  They have three kids, it's Thanksgiving, I'm furious at him.

My sister has no idea and my husband is a total mess.  He has no idea why they chose him to do the firing. This is something that someone in HR usually does.  My husband was promoted last month so maybe it's in his new job description.

"Updates: We [57 M/ and 51/F] empty nesters let my sister inlaw [46/F] and her family move in with us after her husband [46/M] got fired, BIG MISTAKE ....


Previous TL:DR My sister in law and her family moved in our house with us and I can't take it anymore !  
  
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/588hon/we_57_m_and_51f_empty_nesters_let_my_sister_inlaw/  

Well it all finally came to a head about a week after my previous post.  On a Saturday when I wanted to mow our lawn,  my wife asked my sister in law to pick up the dog poop.  Sister in law texted my wife back and stated that she picked up about half a grocery size bag up and told my wife that she should get the rest.   This reply really upset my wife and I so we decided their dogs had to go.  My wife phoned my brother in law and explained that we had enough, it was getting to hard to have 3 dogs in the house and to make plans to move the dogs elsewhere ( we where on our way to meet my daughter and son in law at a restaurant about an hour from home, they had just announced they were expecting there first child, our first grandchild.)  

Five minutes later my sister in law calls my wife back asking what's the problem, etc and they get into an argument of what was going wrong.  It ends with my sister in law telling my wife that if that was the way we were going to be, she was moving her family out of the house as well.  She than texted my wife that living in our house she came to believe that she didn't like the way I treated my wife, and she noticed it but that my wife was blind to my treatment of her.  Now this upset me even more, I was through with my sister in law. 
 
When we got home from our dinner out, the dogs where gone and so were they.  My wife was upset, but we were both relieved they were gone, finally some peace and quite in the house.  

They ended up taking there two dogs to my brother in law's parents house where they were constructing their new home.  Now my brother in law lives at his parents house with the dogs and the oldest teenage son.  My sister in law at first moved into her parents two bedroom townhouse with their youngest son, and traveled between the two locations.  So now they have spread their inconvenience to both their elderly parents and their kids just because my sister in law was to proud and lazy to pick up after herself and her dogs while in my house.  
 
My wife asked her why this was better than just keeping the dogs at one of the other houses while keeping her family together at our house and not spread their troubles to two other households but she didn't have an answer.  
Now in the mean time, they have finally sold their old house and my brother in law has finally got a full time regular job.  Most of there junk is still in our house (my wife moved most of it to one bedroom) and they are in no hurry to move there things out yet.  Construction on their new place is still going on, no ideal when it will be completed yet.  

Thanksgiving dinner at my mother in law's house was very uncomfortable with my SIL and BIL there with there kids and both sets of parents.  I have nothing to do with my SIL now, nor do I want to since she stuck her nose in my relationship with my wife with her comments to my wife about me.  My wife's parents are trying to stay above it and not pick sides but it's wearing on them.  My wife and her sister do still talk to each other now, but the relationship is now very cool.  
It was tough, but at least we have our house back and we are now trying to get it back in shape after our ""visitors"" left.  I'm very happy but I know my wife is still hurt and things are uncomfortable with her family.  

TL:DR My sister in law and her family finally moved out of our house when things came to a head but relationships have been damaged!"
"Boyfriend [20M] says I [19F] shouldn't accept gifts from family members.


I've been looking to buy a car and my sister (32F) recently gave me her old car (volvo s60) to drive as she just bought a new car for herself. My boyfriend says I'm acting like a ""baby sister"" for accepting this gift and I should have refused it. He says that I accept too many gifts from my family and it makes me not an adult. 

I don't understand this logic. What's wrong with accepting gifts? Should I refuse expensive gifts?

"My (28/F) sister's (35/F) husband (35/M) made inappropriate remarks about me when he was drunk. She doesn't think it's a big deal.


We were on a trip together. My sister, BIL, my boyfriend, some friends of ours and myself. It was for a week. On the second last night I couldn't sleep, so I got out of bed to make myself some chamomile tea, and I ran into my BIL in the hallway. Being that I had just gotten out of bed, I was in my pyjamas, no bra. It was chilly. I'm sure you can connect the dots here. I smiled hello and walked past, thinking nothing of it. 


The next night, we all had some drinks and shared stories. BIL went a little overboard and ended up saying some questionable things about me. He started by saying how much I've ""grown"" since he first met me (when I was underage and in high school) and then he just started talking about my body, shamelessly. Our friends went quiet and just stared between the four of us as if waiting for someone to blow up. I was in shock. My sister was trying to play it off as nothing, but she was still telling her SO to take it easy and desperately trying to shift the conversation elsewhere. BIL wasn't as drunk as he was acting (maybe two beers and a shot max) and we had been drinking for hours at that point. I strong suspected that he was sober and just talking shit for the sake of it. My boyfriend was getting very tense and I could see him clenching his fists. He's not really the fighting type, but I could tell he was a second away from losing his cool completely. 


BIL went on to say something about how he saw my nipples poking out through my shirt the other night in the hallway, and that's when my boyfriend lost it. He got up and demanded that BIL leave. Our other friends demanded the same. My sister was white in the face and totally speechless. BIL left, sobered up and tried to talk to me normally the next morning, but I wasn't in the mood to talk to him or even look at his face. On top of that, he kept staring at my boobs. I dress casually and comfortably, so there was nothing for him to look at really, but he did anyway. I feel gross just thinking about it. 


I've since talked to my sister about this and how I don't want to go anywhere near BIL until he gets his shit together. She thinks I'm overreacting and complicating the situation. Our friends are on my side, and so is my boyfriend. BIL didn't just make me feel uncomfortable, he made everyone feel that way including my sister but she's too deep into the relationship to see him for what he is. 


What should I do? She's my sister and I want to help her. She deserves better than to spend her life with a guy who sexualizes her younger sister and then blames it on the alcohol. This isn't the first time he's acted like this either. He ALWAYS stares. Even when I was a teenager. Even at our mother. They don't have kids but they're trying. 


I don't want to see her throw her life away. Ultimately it's her decision, but I'm sure I can help in some way. 


TL;DR - BIL made inappropriate comments about my body. My sister doesn't want to admit that it was a big deal. She's at the age where she thinks she's running out of time, but I *know* she can find someone better than him. He's always been a creep. They don't have kids but they're trying. I really don't want to see her throw her life away just so she can have kids before 40 with this tool. "

"My [66M] wife [61F] is taking care of her aunt [86F] and it is killing our marriage.


My daughter uses Reddit and is helping me type this today. I am at loss in what to do in this situation. 


My wife's aunt became a window two years ago. She came to live with us because she was afraid of staying alone. Since we had extra rooms and that she was perfectly healthy and fine, we decided it was okay to let her stay with us. 

Over time she grew more and more attached to my wife. She wouldn't want her to go to work because she'd miss her, she didn't want her to go shopping because it was always too long, she would follow her to parties and events even if she didn't want to go because she didn't want to be without her. I told my wife that it was becoming unhealthy and that her aunt should talk more to her friends and try to meet with them ( she has a couple friends around her age). My wife always told me that I was exaggerating and that there was nothing wrong. 

Recently, 6 months ago or so, the aunt caught a bronchitis and then another viral infection and some type of spine pain. She became very dependent on us to move her. That's when things started going really bad. She required my wife's attention almost 24/7 and would cry when my wife wasn't around. She wanted my wife to sleep next to her, feed her, talk to her constantly, not go out, not go to work, etc. 

After a week I complained to my wife about not spending any time with her and that her aunt was taking ALL of her. My wife dismissed my worries and told me that she would get better soon. After two months of her aunt acting like a baby and constantly complaining about pain, I suggested we go consult. The doctor said she was perfectly fine, nothing wrong. We had trouble believing it so we consulted different specialists and they ultimately said that if she keeps up her good health, she'd could live another 10-15 years. We met with a psychologist and he said that the aunt needs more tests to determine what she has but that my wife and I clearly need to focus on us and not her her aunt affect our marriage. 

Since I am retired, I told my wife that we should finally go take THE vacations we always wanted. I booked tickets to go on a cruise around Alaska. I even planned everything and asked my daughter [35F] to take care of her aunt. A week before going, I couldn't keep the secret anymore and told my wife what I had done. My wife was clearly happy and amazed. I finally thought we could have some alone good time. When she let her aunt know later that night it was a major catastrophe. The aunt cried, threw tantrums, called all her friends to let her know how awful we were to leave her ""alone"", she even threw herself on the ground. 

I told my wife it was time to put her in a home for elders and that she couldn't stay with us anymore. My wife refused. She said she wasn't going to abandon her and that it's hard to be old. She also cancelled our vacations and said she's sure I'd understand. It hurt me, a lot. I did end up going with my daughter instead and we had a great time, but that's besides the point. 

Now, we are selling our house. It's too big for us. The aunt has a say in all this... She requires a room with specific details such as dimensions, views, number of stairs to come into the house, etc. My wife is actually listening to her and it is making me more and more unhappy. I retired to spend time with her, our kids and our grandkids but it feels like she's only spending time with her aunt. 

We are in couple counselling, it is not helping us, I have been married to her for almost 45 years, I don't want to give her an ultimatum as she is the love of my life and I certainly don't ever want to be without her. I just want to spend quality time with her.

Original post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ejj6c/i_19f_feel_like_i_have_been_waiting_for_my/

The issue I brought to you all wasn't very exciting, however things have taken a severe drop quite quickly.

I drove down to ""Jim's"" dorm on Saturday after letting him know I was coming down to talk. When I arrived and explained everything to him, how I had been asking him to give me more of his time and attention for our entire relationship, nothing had changed, I didn't believe anything was going to change, and I was ending things.

He did not take this well at all. The following two hours consisted of him asking me why over and over again, saying his life was ruined, punching things, grabbing me, promising me to change, asking why I didn't love him, the whole nine yards.

Eventually I was able to leave, and after I drove home I decided to spend the night at a friends house. Unfortunately I had forgotten that I had left my location services on (we turned these on early on in the relationship when we were making more frequent road trips to see each other in the event of a car accident or whatever), so he decided to check up on me and freaked out when he saw that I wasn't home.

I turned the service off, which prompted another emotional meltdown, and I reiterated that I needed him to stop contacting me.

Meanwhile, his mother had begun messaging me about how she hoped Jim and I will work things out soon and she deleted all the ""featured photos"" on her facebook profile except for the one of Jim and I.

Now, today is when the real excitement starts. Upon leaving my physics class this morning, I saw that I had received a message from Jim's father. The summary is that if I love Jim, I need to please give him another chance because everyone is very worried about him. Fuck that

Anyways, it made me a bit uncomfortable so I pulled up Jim's location and the crazy asshole decided to drive down to where I live and was chilling at a Walmart about 7 minutes from my house. He's also been texting my family all day, so my mom decided to meet up with him to get him to calm down.

They're currently talking and I am hiding at a Starbucks.

All in all, I'm glad I got out. I don't think this is a healthy reaction, and I don't appreciate his family trying to manipulate me into reentering a relationship I don't want any part in. I guess there's nothing left to do but ride it out and call the cops if things get really bad.

"My (21M) family just had an intervention with me regarding my GF (27F) of two years. I am so broken. I know what I need to do, but I lack the wherewithal to do it.


Before I start, sorry for the monstrosity of a story I'm sure this will turn out to be. I've got a lot on my chest. I've been dating ""Jessica"" (not her real name) for two years. It has been a rough two years. This is my first relationship, and when it began I was not in the most healthy of places. Too keep things sufficiently vague, I come from a background of death and abuse. One of my guardians, the only one that really loved and cared for me, died when I was a child. The other was abusive, really abusive. I ended up running away in my mid teens and was taken in/all but officially adopted by a former friend's (now brother's) family. I had all kind of crap that I had to work through, and I was starting to make significant progress when I got into my relationship with ""Jessica.""


She was seemingly everything I always dreamed of. Intelligent caring, empathetic, beautiful, you name it and she had it. We ended up dating when I was 19 and she was 24, and I was and am utterly devoted to her. Looking back now, red flags abound, but at the time I couldn't see any of them. There were throwaway comments about how all of her exes' families hated her because they felt she was taking away their child, how she wanted to be loved in an all consuming way, the jealousy of my family whenever I spent time with them and the guilt trips for not spending every second I had with her.

I was not (and am not) without my own problems. I mainly had problems communicating and problems with anxiety due to the fact that I didn't know if I was capable of having a healthy relationship, but this relationship was the final push for me to get better. Therapy, intense self reflection, and an overwhelming desire to finally be unbound from my past drove me to a better place. I left my darker self behind around three months into the relationship, shed that skin finally. The freedom and joy I felt upon burying those horrible habits and obsessions over the pain of my childhood, a process that took almost four years... I can't even explain it. It was beautiful, and I took this new found energy and passion and drove it all into the relationship.

It almost seemed that as I got better ""Jessica"" got worse. Her jealousy ramped up to the point that I was getting phone calls randomly throughout the day to verify where I was. She would go through all of my stuff. I was constantly accused of cheating, of falling out of love, of planning to leave her. This culminated with her hands around my neck, later claimed to be for attention because she thought I was cheating on her. I was shattered. I didn't know what to do. So I called my adoptive mother. She told me to wait until ""Jessica"" was at work, take a day off school, and pack up my stuff. I went along with this, but instead of that I ended up talking to ""Jessica."" I confessed everything to her, and she got upset with me for breaking her trust by talking to my mom. We agreed to separate living arrangements, but we both mutually wanted to continue to work through our issues. I started seeing a therapist to try to solve my cowardice and inability to confront her.

Later it became apparent that she was still going through my stuff. I confronted her about it, and she agreed to go to therapy. She quit shortly after without telling me until months later. Things have gotten better, baby steps. But the constant paranoia and every other problem are still there (besides physical violence) in slightly smaller doses. Despite all this, I love this woman with all of my heart. I would do anything for her, and I have. I've moved across state, changed degrees, done everything for her.

I recently went down to see my family. I only get to see them a couple of times a year, and ""Jessica"" refuses to go. She says that I ruined any chance of her having a relationship with them. My family has been a constant source of strength for me. They've never directly told me what to do, just given advice. This was the first time they directly confronted me. My sister was almost in tears about how I almost never see or talk to them anymore, how they think that if I continue this relationship they will fall to the wayside. My mother said that she can't tell me what to do, but that I better never start a family with this woman for the sake of any children. My father said that she'll drive me to an early grave, just like my horrible guardian did to my loving guardian. My brother said I've got to let her go for her own sake, that I am enabling her and stopping her from actually getting better through not manning up.

I know they are right. I've known that they and all my friends have been right for ages, but it has taken be over a year to get to a place where I am confronting her about the crap she pulls only about 60% of the time. I just seem to have this emotional block. I can't finish it; I love her too much and can't hurt her. I know its stupid. I know its ridiculous. I know that in reality it is ridiculously simple, that I just have to do it. But none of that is helping me actually do it. Like I said, I am in therapy and am trying to work through stuff, but I thought I would try to post to Reddit to see if anyone has been through something similar. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

"My [31F] husband [31M] wants me to stay in the kitchen throughout the long holiday weekend. Need advice.


Hi /r/relationships! 

I stayed up late so I could get some time to write up this post before I head off to bed here. Basically, the title of my post is the issue I am having with my husband right now. We spent a bit of the evening arguing about this issue, and I need some other ammo to direct towards him tomorrow on this. So, my husband ""Jerry"" (fake name/I was watching Seinfeld early) and I have been together for over 5 years now, but we have been married for close to 2 1/2 years now. I love him a lot, and we have never had any major issues. Expect, for this issue that I am facing with him right now. 

Both my husband and I have had most of this week off from work. My husband only worked on Monday, while I work from home, but I tried to get some of my projects done by Sunday night so I could prep for thanksgiving. We had a wonderful evening hosting thanksgiving for both of our families for the very first time. It was awesome! It was nice to see both of our parents and siblings come over to our place and celebrate with us. I really enjoyed making food and dessert for everyone to eat, even though both of our parents brought MORE food to the dinner. It was such a fantastic evening! 

Now, the problem lies after everyone left, and it was just me and Jerry cleaning up everything. Jerry started going off to me how he wants me to make this and that, for the rest of our guests that are coming through this weekend. Our close friends and their SOs are coming over tomorrow night for dinner. On Saturday night, my husbands friends from college (with their SOs as well) are in town and want to have dinner with us. Jerry wanted to host them at our place (keep this in mind for later). Finally, Jerry has some of his cousins coming over for football Sunday, which he hasn't seen in ages. 

Yeah, you could say we have a busy household. Anyway, Jerry was asking me if I could make meals, make snacks, and help keep our company satisfied, fed, and hydrated (laugh). So, I told Jerry that I had no problem helping out, but I wanted him to help me out too. It was bad enough that Jerry told me last minute (Monday night), that his college friends and their girlfriend/wives were coming over for dinner. I told him that he needs to help with the cooking, grocery shopping, and buying alcohol. I told him that it isn't fair for me to bust my ass all week long with constant cooking, baking, buy groceries, and constantly running out to buy alcohol. 

Regardless of everything I just mentioned, we got in a pretty heated fight for around 20 minutes or so. Back and forth, nothing was accomplished in the argument. My husband wants me to stay in the kitchen and take care of all the ""assets"" we need. I mean, it's not like I have a life here or anything?? We had to cancel plans this Saturday night, where my best friend and her boyfriend invited us over to party at her place. I know his college friends that are in town don't come in that often, so I wanted to be fair to him. But, I'm getting tired of doing everything for him without getting any help. I want him to help me, but he says that he is ""too busy"" entertaining our guests.

God, I'm just so frustrated right now. Can someone give me some thought out advice to tell Jerry tomorrow? I need something substantial that will make him consider; ""Yeah honey, you're right, I will try and help you out a little more"". Both of us are on our own roads it seems. Guess what? I'll probably end up doing all of this stuff by myself because I care about our guests, and I love my husband. I just wish I had some help...

Any advice on how I can approach my husband? 

Thank you

"My [20 M] friend [20 F] lost her mom last week but she is not aware of her death.


So a very close family friend (lets call her Jess) of mine has lost her mother but due to her being away from home to focus on her studies at uni she has not found out about it. Her father also warned me not to tell her about it because she has an exam to prepare for and he didn't want her mothers death to affect her grades. One of Jess' friends sent her condolences about her mothers death because she assumed Jess had already found out. Jess then called home to find out if what her friend told her was true but her dad lied about it and she ended up believing him replying that she was on the verge of fainting.  
  
Today Jess has just finished her exams and it is also her birthday today, she hasn't spoken to her mom in weeks, she has not been eating regularly and she still thinks her mom is alive. To make matters worse her dad has postponed her return home to a later date than they had planned. When she arrives home her family plan to bury her mother the day after she comes home.  
  
I haven't lost my parents or anyone that i'm close with before but from what I have seen from Jess' little sister I know that going through this is going to be painful, emotional and very stressful for her. I feel like her dad is not handling the way to tell her about this in the best way and his relationship with her is already on a thin thread from what I have heard from Jess when talking to her.  
  
When Jess' mom died my family went to go and visit her family to support them and I feel like I didn't do a good job in doing that. When I arrived at their I could see that the family was grieving especially the younger sister but I had no idea what I could do to help, I'm not much of a talker so I couldn't think the right words to say and just watched my family comfort them. Jess who I have known practically all my life is coming home later this week and I know that the shock of losing her mom is going to hurt.  
  
She will hate her dad for not telling her about it when he had the chance to but then again it was for the sake of her passing her exams. My parents have told me that I need to take time out of university to support her through all of this which is what I want to do but I don't really know how I can do that since I too have exams and deadlines that I need to prepare for.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Very close friend has lost her mom. Her friend mistakenly told her that her mom had died so she called her dad to make sure but was lied to that her mom was still alive so that she could focus on her upcoming exam.

"I [27m] told my friend [30m] that his girlfriend [27f] was cheating on him and he didn't believe me.


This is a fucked up situation and I just want his friendship back.

I'm also going to use names so it gets less confusing.

Basically, I caught my friend's girlfriend, Candice, cheating on him. I went to a pub and she was there, making out with another guy. She saw me, looked scared as shit and ran away. I followed her and said that if she didn't tell him about what she did, I would. She begged me not to and that it was a ""misunderstanding"" but fuck it. They've been dating for 8 years now, my friend deserved to know.

Well, a week went by and nothing happened. Their relationship was the same and he had no clue about the betrayal. I knew she wasn't going to tell him so I did. I had a serious talk with him and I told him she had cheated on him

At first he thought it was a prank, but when he realized I was being serious he didn't believe me. He accused me of ""trying to destroy"" their relationship due to the fact I'm gay, saying I had feelings for him (?????????????????????????????????????????????????????). I was really hurt by what he said so I told him to fuck off and left. He didn't even try to stop me and apologize. I'm not waiting for an apologize, but seriously, what can I do in this situation?

He's planning on proposing. After 8 years, they're going to get married. And she fucking cheated on him. Is there any way I can make him believe me?

tl;dr: my girlfriend's friend cheated on him. I told her that if she didn't tell him I would. I ended up having to tell him and he didn't believe me and accused me of having feelings for him due to the fact I'm gay."

"My [26F] mom [60sF] is trying to guilt trip me into making a gift for her sick friend at an unreasonable price


Edit: title derp. Make her sick friend a gift. 

I run my own handmade business designing quilts and taking commissions to make quilts. Handmade quilts cost a lot more than people realize. Materials are expensive, and a lot of hours (15-50 hrs are my usual range for 1 large quilt) go into each product. My quilts generally start at $400 minimum. 


My mom knows all of this. She acts almost like a stage mom when it comes to my business. She's a creative person who has a not at all creative career. She got me into crafts and stuff when I was a kid and she always is looking for a creative outlet in her free time, which isn't much these days. She's super proud of me. She loves showing off my accomplishments to her friends and coworkers (quilts published in magazines, a catalog release, licensing deals with big brands, etc.). She will talk to people about my work at any chance she gets. It's great to have a hardcore hype-mom spreading the word about my business, but due to past relationships issues I kinda feel like it's a superficial act. 

She was frankly very neglectful during my childhood. My father abused me physically, mentally, and emotionally (but treated my mom like a queen) while she made no effort to protect me or end the abuse. (See my post history for more on that). 

The issue at hand is she has a friend, Sara, who has a serious illness. She has been going through treatment and her condition is neither improving nor declining at this point. She's well enough to work (low stress office job), if that gives some indication of her condition. 

My mom wants to give Sara one of my quilts as a get well/comfort/Xmas gift. She asked if I had any finished quilts I'd be willing to sell. I work on commission only so any finished quilts are from my personal collection. I happened to have a few that I'd been thinking of selling cheaply since I'm running out of storage space and I'm terribly not fond of these particular quilts. I offered her a few options at $250 each (deeply, deeply discounted). She didn't think they were Sara's style, so I showed her an unfinished quilt i had lying around (it has been a commission that got canceled). She said it was perfect, and said she'd pay me to finish it and give it to Sara. It needs about $200 in labor and materials to finish on top of the $250ish that has already been put in at this current state. I stated this and she said ok. 

Today my mom texted me that she was going to pay me (upfront as we agreed) my $200 today when we meet for dinner and asked if I want in cash or check. Apparently she thinks she only has to pay the $200 *additional* labor/material cost and that all prior work I've done on the quilt isn't her responsibility. I told her she was getting the price wrong and we'd discuss it tonight. She's making some guilt trippy comments related to Sara's illness, giving a discount to my ""dear mother"" etc. 

I'm offended by all this. My mom is wealthy and has no issue spending $450 on stuff for herself in an afternoon. She regularly spends that amount on Sara's Xmas and birthday gifts too. It's me she likes to be stingy with (clearance bin gifts, always trying to get me to give her costly handmade gifts beyond my budget, frequently asking for free/discounted products). I can't afford to give my work away so cheaply. Not to mention it seems so duplicitous of her to act so boastful to others about my work when she doesn't want to pay me fairly for it.

I'm preparing to tell her she needs to pay my standard rate or find another gift Sara, but I'm already hearing all the voices in my head going, ""She's your mother!! Do it for your mother!"" Etc. Am I being heartless or reasonable?

  **tl;dr:** Mom wants to pay me less than half market price to make her sick friend a quilt. I feel I deserve to be paid fairly. Guilt tripping is starting. "
"My [26 M] girlfriend [26 F] has been spying on my facebook for years without telling me..


Apparently, she has been logged into my facebook account for the past 2-3 years without my knowledge.  I recently found out about this fact and in retrospect, it made a lot of things make sense.  I never cheated on her or did anything shady but I feel a severe violation of trust has occurred and I am thinking of breaking this relationship off.  I can't see myself marrying a person that would do something like this.  Am I overreacting?

tldr:  GF hacked my facebook and has been spying on me for years.  wat do"
"My (21f) boyfriend (30) gets extremely mad if I cry.. It causes me to never express my feelings. I need helppp


Been together 2 and a half years and we live together. He's very very sweet all the time. Obvious that he loves me and I love him. 

Basically though.. If I cry, he gets very mad. He says I'm too emotional and get sad and cry for absolutely no reason. I've resorted to saving all my crying for when  he isn't home, or when  I shower. If I'm sad, instead of comforting me or something, he gets mad at I'm upset because ""I have no logical reason to ever be sad because I have a good life"". Which yes I do.. But that doesn't mean I don't get sad. 

I am emotional and especially around period time. It's just who I am. But I could  cry because my dog died, and he'd get so mad at me. What's with this? It makes me feel like I have to pretend to be happy 24/7 to avoid anger. I lurk here all the time and figured I could get some answers :(

Tl;dr; bf gets very mad if I cry or even if I'm a little sad. How do I make him stop??"
