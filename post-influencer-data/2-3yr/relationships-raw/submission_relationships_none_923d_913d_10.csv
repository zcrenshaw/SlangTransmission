"[UPDATE] Me [20s F] with my fellow student [20s M], fellow student has a history of harassing women and is applying to become a teacher in our department. Should I do something?


About a month ago I posted about my worries on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uq0sv/me_20s_f_with_my_fellow_student_20s_m_fellow/). 

**tl:dr** of original: fellow student often harasses young female students and was applying for a job that would put him in a position of authority over exactly those students he targets. I felt I needed to do something to prevent this from happening. 

My special thanks go out to /u/time_keepsonslipping and /u/Pillbot10011 who had a very, *very* good discussion on sexual harassment in academia and how this was quite a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. However, they did help me see that I actually had a solution that was staring me right in the face. 

I went to my mentor, a male professor who's high up the management ladder and actually even responsible for HR for the part of the organization that concerns this story. (Like I said, the solution was *really* staring me right in the face.) I trust this man and I knew he would believe me and follow up on my worries without a second thought. 

I wasn't wrong. I went to see him and simply told him something was worrying me deeply and I needed some advice, after which I told him the story. Now, you should know, this man is a very calm and funny guy. This was the first time since I've known him to find him go quiet and to see anger build up in his eyes. 

He asked me for the name of this person and I told him who it was. Then he told me he will go to HR straight away to ask about the status of his application, and if needed would use his executive position to veto the application. 

He came to see me the next day to tell me the department had already turned down the guy based on his qualifications, so in the end, I was worried for nothing. **However**, we started talking about the subject of (sexual) harassment students may face and how they feel rather helpless because they don't really have anyone to turn to and the system actually discourages students from speak up about it.

Turns out this professor has been very, *very* active in trying to implement integrity and equal opportunity policy on a university wide level, but this was only focused on staff, not students. He took it upon him personally to see policy will be revisited on a university level to also include protection for students, not just staff and that he would use my example as the reason why we need to do this as a university. He also told me that in terms of short term action he would personally go to each department head that falls under his jurisdiction to discuss this matter.

When I spoke to him again some time later, he told me the department heads weren't really open to even acknowledge the problem (surprise, surprise) let alone do something about it. But he's not the kind of man to take no for an answer, so he's planning to go over their heads and develop some management tools for the whole organizational unit that he hopes will also affect the individual departments. 

In the end, I am really glad I took action. Even though in the end, action wasn't needed to prevent the thing I was worried about, I think me speaking up to my mentor has triggered some processes on different levels in the organization that will hopefully lead to some change. I know from experience that this is a very slow process, and I won't notice much change before I'll leave my university, but still, a start was made. If anything, it will lead to more awareness of this issue on different managerial levels. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out. 

**tl:dr** - Had a chat with a professor I know high up the ladder in management. Turned out, fellow student wouldn't have gotten the job anyways. However, my chat with that professor triggered - I hope - positive action on a broader, university wide level that will hopefully lead to some positive change in the years to come.  "

I just got home and I had a day to think it over, I dunno anymore. I really did not enjoy meeting my dad, Zack, and I am just not sure anymore. 

Zack is really immature for a 39 year old. He told me he likes to go to night clubs, bars, talk to young girls, etc, he's a frat boy that never grew up. He's just not what I was expecting. He told me that he could give me pointers on how to get 5 girls in 1 night. He comes off as such a douche. He's so in your face and loud. I don't know if I want  to meet the rest of the family.

"I [23F] am so sick of people in my social circle [20s M-F] implying that something is going on with me and my boyfriend's [25M] best friend [24M]


My boyfriend James and his best friend Carl are like brothers. They lived next door to each other as kids, went to the same university, and have been roommates since university. I've been with James for 2 years now, and we just moved in together in January. We found a place just down the street from their old apartment, and James jokes that the only reason we chose our current place is so he could stay close to his soulmate (Carl).

Carl and I didn't click immediately, but after James mentioned that he wished we were better friends, we tried to find something we had in common to bond over. We discovered that we have similar music tastes, so we started going to concerts together. When Carl invites James and I to an event and James doesn't want to go, he'll insist that Carl and I go have fun without him, which we do. Carl and I will never be super tight bffs, but I treasure his friendship and it's great that we finally have some common ground.

According to our friend group (and the posts I've lurked on /r/relationships), this is weird. James and I have received backhanded comments about how I shouldn't be spending so much time alone with another man, and how much fun Carl and I must have without James there. Once Carl and I went to the symphony (which James hates), and we had our photo taken by some nightlife company and had our picture posted on their Facebook page. We were standing several feet apart in the photo and clearly talking with other people, but a mutual friend screenshotted this and sent it to James with a very rude comment, and James immediately unfriended her.

These comments make me mad because 1) they imply that the only reason Carl and I hang out is to fuck behind James' back, not like we're actually friends with shared interests, and 2) there's the implication that I am not allowed to do anything without James there, and that doing otherwise is disrespecting my relationship. James usually laughs these comments off and dismisses them, while I just don't know what to say.

What I would like to know is how to handle these sorts of comments when they come up - I don't think Carl and I are doing anything wrong. James and I are always invited together, and he has stated many times he's happy that Carl and I have become good friends. What should I do?

tl;dr: I became good friends with his best friend, and we sometimes go to events with him (at his insistence). Friend group making unwelcome assumptions about my fidelity and rude comments."

"UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [25 M] of 1 year recently picked up and moved 15 hours away for absolutely no reason. Things have been extremely rough ever since.


[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5nmqvs/my_24_f_boyfriend_25_m_of_1_year_recently_picked/?st=J0GSYYYX&amp;sh=d7722669)


Hey guys.

My original post garnered more attention that I've ever personally received here so I figured I'd do an update.

Shortly after my post, John (the boyfriend) and I broke up.
Big surprise right?

It was mostly mutual, still really sucked.
He pushed to try and ""make things work"" -- What does that even mean?

And would constantly flip flop from ""I'm never moving back"" to ""Well, I'll move back for YOU"".

No thanks.

A) I wasn't a reason to stay here in the first place, so why would I be the reason he would move back? and B) seems like a quick path to resentment if I'm the sole reason he would be moving back.

So yeah, we broke up.
I unceremoniously sent back what few belongings of his I had to his new address.
We went NC shortly after.

Details emerged several weeks following from various sources (I.E. mutual friends, randoms) that while we were dating there were ""always girls at his apartment"".

Okay...cool.
Didn't know what to believe.

A week ago I was cleaning out my car and found makeup under the passenger seat that didn't belong to myself or any of my female friends.
I also should add that John frequently borrowed my car on occasion during our relationship.

So idk, he was probably also cheating/at the very least being shady.

Somehow this person I'm not even with anymore continues to be able hurt me.


Luckily other areas of my life are coming together nicely.
I recently got a new job that I love.

I'm also working at two different places and 7 days a week so I don't have time to be a total mess haha.
I have more money than I've ever had in my entire life and no longer have to sweat bullets when it comes time to pay my bills.

Currently still in the post breakup phase of crying in my car on the way home from work sometimes if I'm particularly exhausted.

I've done all the stereotypically ""moving on stuff"" like cutting my hair, going on a few dates, getting drunk, shopping, masturbating, etc.

But I still miss him and he still occupies a good portion of my thoughts.
Just kind of waiting for it to pass I guess....

So yeah, thanks again to everyone who offered words of advice, wisdom, or kindness when I came here 2 months ago totally wrecked emotionally, I really appreciated it.

Hopefully whatever comes next is totally fucking awesome and I won't have anything to post about anymore 🙃😂



**TL;DR: John and I broke up. Details of him possibly cheating during our relationship emerged shortly after. Still really bummed but life is looking up. Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond.**






**EDIT: You guys are awesome. Thanks for all the continued support and good feelz ❤️**"

"My [25F] GF [25F] of 6 months got a tattoo of my name despite me not wanting too


Title speaks for itself.


My GF Erica and I have been dating for 6 months. It's my 2nd relationship, it's her fifth.


Erica and I have been having a nice relationship so far. She's sweet, smart, funny, pretty, all I could ask for in a girl. 


However, I want to take our relationship slow. Where Erica has liked to me more passionate about things. We hooked-up twice and texted a week when she asked to be exclusive, despite having broken up with her ex, with who she has lived together, 4 months before.


Anyway, a month ago she told me she wanted a new tattoo. Awesome, she has 2 tattoos already, they look very nice: A tiger on her arm and a quote from the movie 'Up' on her wrist. She suggested a tattoo of my name. I laughed cause I thought she was joking.


She wasn't. The whole month she asked about it, and I clearly stated that I didn't want it. I thought having a tattoo with the name of a SO is a huge risk, definitely after 5 months and I stated that clearly several times.


She told me it would be the 'sign of her love for me'. And that it would mean we would be together for 'a long time'.


The week before her tattoo appointment we had argued A LOT. I caught her texting girls on Tinder (we had an agreement to not be on Tinder), and she has been giving me advice for my future, including what to do with future gf's. I was extremely uncomfortable. Yet she went on and on.


I went to see my sister last Friday and when I saw Erica this morning, she had a 'surprise'. Low and behold, there is my name on her right-arm, including the date we became a pair.


What do I do?

She went out of town for a few days so another coworker and I flipped all the photos, documents and such in her cube upside-down.

When she came in this morning, she didn't say a word and still hasn't spoken to me. Just quietly reorganized her cube.

He's extremely insecure and always thinks I am going to leave him for ""something better.""

Basically, I got a job today. He even gave me tips today when I asked him how I should better prepare myself for interview questions.


Today was a follow up (2nd) interview. After I left, they called about an hour later to offer me a position. When I told my husband I got the job, he said he ""found it suspicious they gave me a job the same day.""


I asked him if he was joking. He continued to further this toxic conversation by saying that he's ""going to have to keep closer tabs on me."" and that he *doesn't want to have to worry about what I'm doing when I'm at ""work.""*


He ended by telling me that I'm ""too much BS and not enough good.""


**Verbatim:** ""You want to be this hip, cool, independent girl. Why be married? or why be in your kid's life? Why do you have to work when I have a great career. You don't always have to be doing something. Just be happy and raise our kid.""



At this point I told him that he's not a supportive spouse whatsoever and that he is acting like a sociopath and that we need to get counseling. 


I don't know what else to do. He is not fazed by me not talking to him when he gets home. He just harasses me via text or will accuse me of something if I don't respond to his obvious trap messages. I asked him why he would say a ridiculous thing about our son solely because I got a job. He doesn't answer to logic. 


I'm at my wits end. I'm a loyal wife. I'm not interested in other people. I'm committed to the fullest extent but it still isn't good enough for someone with such obvious crippling anxiety and insecurities.

  I suspected he had been seeing someone new as he had been calling me that week from a different number, and when I asked where he was, he told me ""a friend's"". He doesn't tend to discuss his relationships with me or be forthcoming about this sort of thing.

"My [21M] friends claim that my girlfriend [18F] ""is not jealous enough"" and that she's brainwashing me with her behavior. I don't know what to think.


I've been with my girlfriend for quite some time. We met when she was 16 (she's turning 19 soon) and I was 18. When I met her, she was going through a lot of things and suffering from a great deal of depression/anxiety. She has gotten much better though, and I'm very happy for her. I'll call her ""Anna.""

Anna is versatile in the sense that sometimes she acts like a ""bro"" and sometimes she acts like an extreme girly-girl. For example, I've seen her playing WoW while watching a makeup tutorial on her other monitor. Shocking, right, who knew that girls could like video games *and* makeup? */s*

She wears both masculine and feminine clothing depending on how she feels, etc. I don't want to get too into it because it really doesn't matter. Anna is also bisexual and we'll often talk about girls together, whether it's pointing out that someone is attractive or making silly jokes together.

I made the mistake of talking to my friend about this when he was talking to me about how his girlfriend always gets mad at him for liking another girls' picture on IG. I said something along the lines of, ""that sucks dude, Anna doesn't care if I do that,"" and I think that that lowkey set him off, because the next day we hung out with our whole friend group and they were all talking to me about how Anna doesn't really love me because she doesn't care if I ""talk"" to other girls (I don't talk to any other girls.) I tried explaining to them how she is, but they said that I'm being brainwashed into thinking that she's ""laidback"" and that I'm getting played. 

One of them even brought up an example in which me, Anna and my friends were out to eat, and she made a little joke about giving the waitress my number. It was all in good fun. I laughed. She laughed. Supposedly, no one else thought it was funny. They said that no girl who loves their man would ever say something like that, ""how is it possible that she's okay with that?"", etc.

Is this really that uncommon amongst her and my peers? Anna doesn't care about certain things, yeah, but the girl has boundaries. She doesn't care if I like a girls' pic (and honestly, I don't even do this to anyone besides my female friends that I value platonically and she knows this,) yeah, but she would definitely have a problem with me commenting, ""damn, you're sexy"" under another girls' picture. She'd definitely give a shit if I cheated on her, etc. but she is open to things like threesomes, which is something else that my friends don't understand. 

Anna and I have discussed all of these things, boundaries and all, a long time ago. Some people get jealous, and some people have insecurities, I get that, but I think that we have a very healthy relationship. Are we supposed to just hide that because it makes other people uncomfortable? I don't know what to tell my friends because they don't get it.

**EDIT:** I have read each and every one of your comments. They've helped me a great deal and although I can't reply to all of them, I appreciate them so much. Thank you guys.

"Boyfriend [22/M] posted on reddit multiple times that he is falling for another girl and he wants to break up with me [21/F] but acts like the relationship between him and I is perfectly fine


Hello! I wanted to preface this by saying thank you for taking the time to read about a stranger over the internet and her relationship problems. 

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My boyfriend and I had a rough start. We started off as friends with benefits but eventually became a committed couple. I had ridiculously abusive parents and I was also very poor. This meant I relied on him a lot for rides and money. However, I would seldom ask for the amount of generosity he would give me but he insisted that he did it because he loved me and didn't expect much in return. We've known each other for 3 years, been together for 2, and in the last 8 months I was able to move out of my parents' house, get a job, and a car. Things we were both waiting so long for. The past couple years have been hard on me but he was always my rock. However, now that life is looking up for me, I find that he is no longer as caring as he once was. 

About a month ago he posted on reddit saying how he wanted to break up with me because he felt suffocated and how with my newfound independence he realized how much he gave up for me. I felt extremely hurt because for the majority of our relationship I have always encouraged him to not prioritize me the way he did and whenever I would attempt to hang out with friends of my own he would always get insecure to the point where I would stop hanging out with them even though he never said I should. I was honestly so peeved about how he'd whine about how insecure he was that I stopped seeing most of my friends altogether. 

In his posts he also mentions how he feels guilty about wanting to break up with me since I am in love with him but he feels much better on his own or with his friends. 

The day after this post he immediately comes to my place after his class and is in tears, he's graduating from university this May and is under a lot of stress but what he's saying isn't lining up with what his reddit posts says. He mentions that he does love me and that he does want to be with me. He mentions that I wasn't a burden to him and he did all that he did because he wanted to and not out of obligation. He doesn't know that I know his reddit handle and I know this is a breach of privacy but he wouldn't communicate to me. This all dropped out of the clear blue sky. 

When he first told me about his anxiety about graduation I hadn't read his post yet and I was surprisingly well-composed and suggested we break up and I wouldn't take it personally. If he feels he can't juggle work and school on top of graduation then I don't want to impede on his success. However the more we talked the more upset I became because he keeps saying that he loves me and wants to be with me. We agree to go on a break which I took pretty well initially until I read the post. Our guidelines for the break were to still keep in contact but at our own pace, he initially tells me that if I start falling for another guy and I feel like it's serious enough then I should go for it. Which was a huge red flag that I should have noticed sooner. During the times where he was the clingy one and I demanded a break, I never received one especially if I brought up the possibility of seeing other people. We managed to work out our prior grievances but I can't help but feel cheated. During the break he has spent a large amount of time with his friends which was to be expected, but I did feel neglected considering he would only make the effort to see me if his prior plans were cancelled and our dates were no where near as grandiose as the hang out with his friends. 


Our spring break was last week and we went on a fairly nice date on March 19th where he held my hand, he said I love you, he seemed happy. However, through this month he has been changing. He has always been prim and proper and I was the only who would be outlandish and the dynamic work. However, I find that lately he has been extremely casual and he honestly is a complete 180 of the guy I first started dating. 

I was happy in a way because the traditional side of him was a bit of a bother but this new.. ""cool/cocky"" attitude is a bit overdone. 

A few days after I asked him if we could talk about the break and he just goes, ""Oh yeah! Things went back to normal so I totally forgot we were even on a break"" which was dumb and also highly unlike him. 

I didn't feel relieved now that the ""break"" was officially over. Things seemed to go back to normal as he said but they still felt.. off. 

I checked his reddit, which he did tell me his username ages ago but I think he forgot, and he posted saying how he's falling for a classmate, hard. and he mentions that he went out to bars, museums, and concerts 5 times over the break. I felt so fucking blindsided. During break he would always ask me what I'm doing and who I was hanging out with but never told me this. 

What bothered me even more was that the post was in regards to if he has a chance with her. He didn't even mention that he's still in a relationship AT ALL. The advice given to himis that he should pursue this girl and he seems like he will. 

I planned a date this Friday but I told him I want to cancel it and have a talk instead. 

I don't know how to feel. I felt like him blindsiding me was also my fault because earlier that week we watched an episode of a show that consists of drama, murder, and a gratuitous amount of affairs. I told him that if I were ever cheated on I would rather not know and I feel like physical cheating is more vile than emotional. Upon reading his post I wanted to take it all back. Both forms of cheating are obviously vile and I do want to know why he did this. 

I guess my question is, what do you think of this situation and how should I approach this on Friday?

tl;dr: Boyfriend made posts saying he wants to break up and is falling for a girl hard but is telling me that everything is okay and that he loves me and wants to be with me. How do I approach him about this?

"UPDATE I (22F) have developed a crush on my DM (22M). What should I do?

It's happy!

I first took a cowards' way out and invited our entire group out for an event, but we ended up being the only two who went. Eventually we (intentionally) hung out one-on-one and started dating.

He's every bit as sweet and caring and hilarious as I originally thought he was (slightly moreso, actually). He's absolutely brilliant and I'm so glad we took the leap, I've never been happier. Rest of my life has been throwing me curveballs all year, but he's been a veritable pillar of support through it all. Crit success, for sure. If y'all knew my main account you'd roll your eyes at how cheesy and head-over-heels we are for each other from my posts, haha.

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me!

TL;DR: I told him that the next time he lies to me, I'm done. I can't stay in a relationship with someone I don't trust. He just lied to me again, and I'm desperate for options. I love him and I don't want to leave but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. 

The background: 

We started dating in 2009, got married in 2015. He'd lied to me about minor things a couple times while we were dating, which I wasn't comfortable with, but we went to therapy for it, and it didn't seem like a big problem. (Yeah, I know how that sounds.)

After we get married, I find out he's been lying to me about drinking for like a whole year. It's bad. Before I realized it was booze, I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me what was going on. He didn't. It got to the point where I didn't trust myself anymore, because I was seeing that something was fishy and he kept denying it. He only caved and told me about the drinking when I finally said I wasn't talking to him anymore unless he told me what was up. 

This started a (really expensive) round of therapy, both couples and individual for both of us, and a psychiatry referral for him. Therapists and psychiatrist agree that there seem to be issues with alcohol, but that he doesn't actually seem to be alcoholic. He tried taking disulfram for a while to prove to me he's not drinking. That worked for a while, but eventually I realized that I still didn't trust him. Recently we decided that it ultimately has to be his responsibility to drink (or not drink) responsibly, so he's been drinking a bit, usually with me. I had stated, though, in no unclear terms that I cannot be in a relationship with someone who lies to me, and that the next time it happened would be the last. I feel that we've gone through so much therapy over the years that if that hasn't made a difference, I don't know what will. 

So anyway. Tonight I went to bed before him and I'm woken up when he trips on something and hits his head on the wall. There's bleeding, but what worries me is that he seems out of it and he's slurring his speech. I ask him if he's drink a couple of times, he says no. I say that we should go to urgent care if he's hit his head so hard that he's slurring, and finally he eventually admits that he'd been drinking. 

Sooooooo yeah. He's lied to me twice about drinking tonight, and it's pretty clear that that's crossed my line in the sand. I don't want to go. I love him. Even our therapists have said that in a lot of ways we're a model couple... except apparently when he's being a lying shithead.

I'm also daunted at the process of starting my life over when we divorce. I work part-time at a non-profit for a low wage with no benefits, so I guess it's time to start job hunting, too. 

If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them. I can't let myself get lied to over and over, but maybe one of you has a magical solution that I haven't seen yet. 

Thanks. 

**Edit:** I brought up the ""model couple"" thing because I want to convey that there are seriously good points about the relationship too. If it weren't good in a lot of major ways I'd be gone already. To me it's worth saving, *if* it's possible to save. I'm not trying to use that to justify staying per se; regardless of how good I think it is, I do know I can't stay in a relationship with someone who won't stop lying to me.

**Edit 2:** He started lying to me about drinking before I made any suggestion that he might not be drinking responsibly. I'm not against drinking in general. I drink. I like drinking. I like drinking with my husband, when things don't go tits up.

**Update:** Thanks for the support and comments, everyone. At my request, he's not staying at home now - staying a a hotel or somewhere for at least a while. I haven't made the plunge yet and told him we're done, but he knows it's still on the table. I might just not have it in me to do it all at once, so I'm considering this the first step.

One small glimmer of hope is what everyone's said about alcoholism. We haven't gone through treating that, and it seems like maybe there's a glimmer of home that treatment could help. Even if I'm fooling myself, at least he's not under my roof anymore. I've told him that if there's even a chance of this working out that he has to stop drinking and start to get help.

**Update 2:** I've realized I've worded it wrong. I should not have said, ""if you lie to me again I'm leaving,"" because that is an ultimatum and it shouldn't have been. It should have been a statement of fact, to express what I needed in the relationship. What I should have said was, ""I cannot stay in a relationship with someone who lies to me."" If it's a problem with alcohol that's causing him to lie to me, and he's seriously working to address that, I'm willing to give it another go. It's still scary, though.

"Me [24 F] with my Coworker [34 F]; she buys the same clothes as me, and considers me a ""sister."" She's clingy and it's creeping me out.


Small update: Thanks everyone the awesome advice! Lots of things I'm starting to implement. I agree with a lot of the comments. I don't communicate clearly enough with Emma about how her behavior makes me feel. The main reason is that I do feel bad for her. She's somewhat ostracized from our department. I want to be kind, since like I said she's perfectly sweet. She's just overbearing, clingy, and doesn't know appropriate professional boundaries. She's always reminded me of a fourteen year old girl in terms of her insecurities and sensitive nature. I was truly shocked when I first found out she was in her 30s. I couldn't believe it, and I found it easier to understand if I thought of her as a teenager. Getting her feelings hurt over small bouts of silences? Constantly thinking people are ""mad"" at her? Wondering always if people ""like her"" or are ""talking about her""? Much easier to understand if she's a teen girl in my brain. 

Thinking of her as a grown woman who is responsible for her own feelings is something I need to start doing. That alone will make me less accepting of a lot of her behavior. 

I've been creating more distance by barely responding to her work IMs, and rejecting any requests to go shopping or hang out. I'm doing it all politely, ""Sorry, really busy,"" and ""I have plans, thanks though!"" Still not as direct as I should be, but I am creating more of a distance and it feels good.

I also, thank God, applied for three new positions at my workplace! I have a good shot at them so hopefully I'll only have another month or two of Emma. 

My current job has other annoying qualities. Emma's not the only factor in this decision, but man it will be good to get some space! 

Hopefully, after some more distance and boundary setting, we can have a healthy, (grab lunch once a month) kind of work-friendship in the future. 

Thanks again everyone! 

Original Post:

  Back story: Emma (34) is an incredibly sweet, albeit not a very bright or mature woman. We've worked together for about one and a half years. Emma gives off a very ""teen girl"" vibe. She's sensitive and emotional, needs to be included in inside jokes or conversation, thinks people are mad at her if they aren't engaging with her. Just a desperate ""please be my friend!"" and ""please like me!"" vibe.  It turned one of my coworkers off to the point where he barely responds when she talks to him. It's rude, definitely, but part of me gets it. She's a lot to handle and lately I've been struggling more with being around her. 

When I first got the job as part of Emma's team two years ago, after just a few days she called me her ""work sister."" I laughed and said I already had two sisters and we didn't always get a long, but that was sweet of her to say. I thought that would end it, but she still occasionally tells me ""You're like a sister to me!"" I respond with small smile, or say ""That's nice!"" or ""Aww that's sweet."" However it grates on me and I don't want to encourage that level of clinginess.  

We are friends; we work right next to each other on a very small team and sit right next to each other. She does sweet things like buy the office treats, decorates people's cubicles for birthday's, etc. We do laugh and have fun at work but lately this work friendship has gotten too intense and one-sided. Some examples: 

- There is a shopping area near our work. Emma and I often shop during lunch breaks. We went a few times together, but every time I'd find a shirt or jacket and show her she'd want the same thing...and nearly always ended up buying it. I gave her a bit of attitude saying, ""Well hopefully we don't show up wearing the same thing now.""  She responded, ""Why not? It's cute I would be twinsies with my friends in middle school!""

OK, that creeped me out and I decided the easy solution is no more shopping with Emma. 

I'd shop by myself, and when I came back to the office with shopping bags she'd ask to see what I'd bought. Well, I thought it was harmless to show her, but when she asked where I got a particular top, she ran out and went to go look for it at the store so she could have it too.

One recent lunch break, she texted me from the store, ""Omg, I found that jacket you have! I want to get it!"" 

I told her she could buy whatever she wanted, but I'd prefer she didn't since she had JUST bought a few new jackets, and we have a lot of the same clothes. She texted back sad faces but didn't get the jacket. Relieved, I thought I was clear and Emma would understand you can admire someone's clothes without owning them.

But no. Last week I showed up wearing a new shirt. It was fairly distinctive and Emma admired it ""Omg cute shirt!"" not thinking I said, ""Thanks I got it on sale last week at X Store."" 

That same day she goes out to shop at lunch, comes back and said, ""I went to X Store but they didn't have your shirt! I really want it!"" 

I was visibly annoyed and said, ""Well that's probably good we have a lot of the same stuff already.""

Then yesterday she lets me know, ""I went back to X Store and they still didn't have it, but they special ordered it online for me!"" I didn't really know what to say and was kind of in shock; still am a bit. Am I overreacting? It is a pet peeve of mine to show up to the office dressed in the same top; there are endless ""Omg look at you two twins!"" comments, which she enjoys but drive me nuts. 

- Another example of clinginess: our work has an instant messaging System, and our department IMs often with each other about work stuff but mostly just to joke around or chat. Emma chats me almost all day, and I chat back but at about half the rate (my one message for every three or four of Emma's). If I don't respond for awhile, I'll get the ""Are you mad at me?"" bit. 

If someone else chats me and she sees their chat window on my screen, she gets jealous, ""Oh, so and so is chatting with you I see. They never chat with me. :( Are you guys talking about me?""

I've straight up told her she's being nosy and paranoid, but she'll get mopey and can't help glancing at my screen. 

Reddit, please help! She's a sweet girl with a big heart, but her clinginess and ""twinning"" is driving me up the wall. I'm not planning on changing jobs, so how can I deal with her behavior?

"My boyfriend of 14 years broke up with me. Said he ""didn't love me enough to sustain a relationship."" I am simultaneously devastated and dead inside. I don't know what to do.


We met in our mid-30s and are now late 40s (I am female; he is male). We did not live together but had a life that very much revolved around each other. He has children. One now in college, the other going off. One day we were literally talking about big-ish future-type things, we had just gone away together, and a few weeks later he tells me he's not sure he ever loved me.

He's always been kind, always been generous. Says now he's just ""well domesticated"" and that maybe I don't have enough ""edge."" We never argued, not really. We always compromised. He said the relationship was great, enjoyable, that he will miss me. Said maybe the relationship was ""too good;"" that we never had to deal with anything difficult. I said this was difficult, why don't we deal with this. Fourteen years is too much to just let go. He smiled and said I was always so reasonable. Said a relationship counselor would just tell me what he was told when his marriage ended - to let it go.

I am not a part of his children's lives. There was too much strife in his past marriage to allow this. It always bothered me but I accepted he knew best how to manage his life. They know about me and talk of me and vice versa, but there could be no room for me in their lives. He has always been around for his children and a very present figure and did not want to add strife to an already difficult situation. His life is at a crossroads as the daily care and attention will soon not be needed and he will no longer need to be in his ex's orbit with such frequency.

He had come to my place unexpectedly. To both tell me this and give me my stuff and ask for keys. I could not. I said he knew me well enough to know I wouldn't do anything horrible. He agreed.

I am numb. I am in shock. I don't know what else to do but ask internet strangers for help. (BTW, long-time lurker, first time poster.)

"I [29f] am not comfortable with my boyfriend's [28m] new lifestyle. Dating 5 yrs. Help!


Like the title says, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. Let's call him Sean. I will also have to apologize for the writing style, more a stream of consciousness.

Sean and I met when we were in college. I am now working in a professional environment with a M-F 9-5 type schedule. He has not yet found a job in his chosen field and has been working at a bar for the last 6 months. He normally works either a late shift 6pm-12am or from 9pm-3am.

We live in an area (and sorry to be vague, boyfriend is also on Reddit) where the bars do not have a mandated closing time. I'm not opposed to going out with friends and having a good time but my schedule does not normally allow me to be out all night. 

We've had a couple of instances where he was still out when I got up in the morning, and was still out when I left for work! I've picked him up from bars where he could barely walk and have made sure that he gets home safe. He's told me that he's done cocaine to deal with the late schedule.

Well, recently, he told me he was going out with a few of his coworker's after work. I found out later that these coworker's were two women I've met in passing but don't know well. One of these ladies we'll call Sarah. I get a weird vibe from Sarah and think she's a little too friendly with Sean. I don't think he cheated but it feels like he omitted which coworker's he was out with purposefully. That same night he didn't come home and I picked him up from a bar at noon the next day.

I laid it out there that I was in no way comfortable with the way he acted. I explained that because we're no longer in our early 20s and have been dating for a while that I really want a more domestic lifestyle and someone who wants to start building a future together. He apologized and promised that he would try harder to take my feelings into account and assured me that we still have the same goals.

Well, I met him last night to go out together when he got off work. I waited for an hour and a half because his coworker's couldn't get their stuff together enough to help with tips and even though I was there waiting, he felt as though he needed to stay and help (please note that there were 3 or 4 other coworker's just talking to each other who he could have asked to help). I was upset that I had to wait. Not the end of the world but it was already almost midnight when he got off work and by that time I just wanted to go home.

When he finally finishes, he tells me that Sarah is going to come with us to the show we wanted to go to. She comes with and mentions that Sean told her that I was upset about waiting and that it wasn't his fault.

Well, now I feel like not only was it disrespectful to let her join us, Sean shouldn't have told her that I was upset. 

I need advice. How do I salvage this relationship? Are my feelings understandable or am I being too sensitive? And how can I tell him to kick Sarah to the side without being a jerk?

TL;DR
I'm upset that my boyfriend and I have different lifestyles and am not comfortable with his actions or his friendship with a new female coworker.

This is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5yfjr0/dating_my_21f_best_friend_23f_admitted_to/


So after that post I tried to hint to my friend that I'm ready to talk openly with her. She immediately shut me down and said she just didn't want to talk.

The next day she came to me and agreed to talk. It was awkward, painfully awkward. The entire thing was drenched in sarcasm to make it less tense. I told her that I liked her as well, but her hesitation was making me nervous. Eventually we gave up on talking.

Two days later I woke up to a letter under my door. She wrote about two pages about what she wanted, what she was worried about, and basically poured her heart out in it. I did my best to respond to her concerns in the letter as well as add in what I wanted and left my letter under her door the next night. 

After that, talking was much easier. We basically agreed on not forcing anything since A) she is still discovering her sexuality and B) We don't want to do anything that would risk our friendship.  So we have opened the door, but made no serious decisions. There has been a lot of flirting and cuddling. I'm hopeful for our future.

Tl;dr We couldn't talk so we wrote letters back and forth and now we are open to see what happens."

"My girlfriend [21F] wants to open a joint investment bank account with me [24 M] I said no, and now she thinks I'm not committed


My girlfriend and I have lately been looking into financial investments and now she wants to create a joint investment bank account with me. I don't see the point of doing it and Ive heard so many people advise against doing it with someone you are not married to. She said that her idea is that we basically put in 1000$ each to start and then just contribute 20$ a month to it each and don't touch it and let it grow. 


After looking at all the facts and seeing how there is actually no financial benefit to joining these accounts, I suggested that we just do it on our own and if it comes to the point that were engaged we can just pool our money together. However, she took that as me not being committed because I told her that it can get messy if we ever end our relationship and we have an account together. But I am very committed, I definitely do see a future with her (we've been dating a little over two years). She also said that I was limiting her potential and if I wasn't going to do an account with her then she'll do one with someone else, which i found kind of harsh. I know she's not the type to try and take all my money either.


Basically her idea is that if we do it together then we have more power because were doing it as one. I have trouble even understanding what that even means. What do you guys think about creating a joint account in my situation?

  **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

"My (27F) husband (28M) of 7 years blew up on me last night


Hello guys, I'll try to keep this short. Sorry in advance for any grammatical errors - writing has never been my thing. 

My husband and I have had a decent relationship, we've been together 9 years and have been married for 7. We also have an 18 month old son together. I thought I could completely trust him until yesterday. 

Last night he had asked me to put a reminder in my phone to text him about something today. While doing that, I had noticed that his calendar had synced with mine, because I had put his email in my phone to see the messages his mother sends him. He knows I have his email in his phone, I look at it to check dates of get togethers, when his mother is going to pick up our son, etc. 

Anyways, I brought it up that I had his calendar reminders for his paydays, and I told him I also have his contacts too. I really didn't think anything of it, I didn't go through them or anything like that. I didn't bring it up before because I just completely forgot. 

Well, he freaked out on me and got really angry and defensive. It was completely out of character for him and I was shocked, to say the least. 

I went outside to cool down, and when I came back I tried to talk to him. I'm going to be honest and say that I was upset, but I was trying to be calm. I asked him why he was reacting like this, and he went off on me, saying that he's tired of this shit, I do this all the time, that I'm fucking crazy, and that I'm on my phone all fucking day so why didn't I bring it up to him. He also told me to check his phone if I didn't trust him. I honestly didn't even know how to react. I've never looked through his phone before or anything like that. Like I said, I trusted him and couldn't care less who he has in his phone. Plus, he's not stupid and would have deleted anything while I was outside. 

I guess I'm just lost. He calmed down and told me he doesn't know why he reacted the way he did, and to just drop it, but I'm having a really hard time doing that. The thing is, is that he doesn't go out much, so he's usually at home or work. He hasn't given me any signs about being untrustworthy, but I don't know why he'd act like that. I’m having a hard time believing that he would act like that for no reason, and now i think he's hiding something. Please give me some advice on how to deal with this. 

Thank you to whoever reads this, and again I apologize for any errors. 


**TL;DR:**My husband got uncharacteristically angry at me when I told him I had his contacts in my phone, and now I'm worried he's hiding something.

"[22/F] I regret moving in with my boyfriend [23/M] and now I feel depressed and I feel trapped.


""Ray"" and I will be together for 7 months next Saturday. We live together and always have. These days, I'm faced with nothing but remorse, regret and depression because I regret my decision.

 It was my apartment first. He came over one night after sushi, he spent the night and never left and slowly over time moved his stuff in and then it became our apartment. The people he lived with before me divorced and she owned the house so he had to move out anyway, and I was having a hard time affording things on my own, and we got along so well so it seemed like a good idea at the time..

 Now I find myself becoming increasingly annoyed over time to the point that I don't even wanna be home anymore.

First: I feel as though he took over the place. He moved in all this stuff and it all HAD to be out in the open, and as a result I had to rearrange and remove a large portion of my stuff. A bunch of my things are now in boxes in the storage unit in the basement. His PS4 is now in the livingroom, he sent my 360 into the bedroom because he likes watching Netflix before bed. Now the livingroom is ""his space' where he sits on my futon and plays his PS4 on my TV with his mic on talking and yelling at his friends. I'm unable to speak or do much in my own livingroom because he always has his headset on, his friends can hear me and everything I say and do, and I'm always met with disapproving glances whenever I speak or do anything loud.

Second: My bedroom. I can't rearrange the furniture or do anything to my bedroom. I want to move things around because my furniture has been in the same spot since I moved here almost a year ago. But he says ""No he doesn't want the bed there."" ""No we can't have the dresser there because XYZ"" ""He likes it this way."" and so its stuck the way it is. Its frustrating because I just want to move my things to where I want them but I can't because now this is a shared space and all our decisions have to be mutual decisions.

Third: When we go grocery shopping I'm unable to buy what I want. We have to split things 50/50 which means what we buy is a mutual decision. I can't throw a 2.99$ frozen pizza in the cart because he hates frozen pizza. He hates green beans so we can't buy those. I hate it so much that now when we go grocery shopping I don't even speak or put things in the cart I just let him go and pick what we buy.

Fourth: I have no ""me"" time. Sure I can go into the bedroom but hes still in the next room and I can still hear him yelling at the TV. If I'm on the phone with my mom he can hear me in the next room, I have no privacy because if I'm texting or FBing someone he can see everything I'm doing. I don't even have anything that's ""mine' anymore. Its all ""ours"". Even though ALL the furniture in this apartment is MINE and the majority of the stuff is MINE, he now dubs it ""ours."" Our bed, our dresser, our TV, our cat, our futon, our dishes. Nothing is allowed to be called 'mine' anymore and whenever I call something ""mine"" he gets upset. 

I miss having MY space and MY things. I want to be able to push my bed up against the wall, and buy a frozen pizza and sit in my livingroom and watch TV and be able to speak without being glared at or having his friends hear me and make fun of me, and I want to be alone without someone else in the next room listening to my every word or reading my every text.

 His name isn't on the lease. The landlord doesn't even know he lives here. I haven't told him yet because of the fact that I somehow KNEW this would happen. I wanted to make sure that I had an escape route incase things went sour.. I tried to talk to Ray the other day about possibly living sepeaately and he told me that if we don't live together then we can't be together because theres no way we can date and live separately. So basically getting my own space = being single.

 I can't move out anytime soon. My lease is up in June but even so, I have next to no money and I have nowhere else to go. I'm a full time student working a part time job. My rent is almost 700$ a month, and bills + food altogether is 900$. I have 1200$ in the bank and I make 100-200$ biweekly. I can't AFFORD to kick him out. The government won't help me, student loans can't give me anymore, I have an appointment at the bank but I'm doubtful that will do anything. I'm literally trapped.. I'm depressed, I cry all the time, I find myself making excuses to leave just to be alone and get away from him.

 What do I do? What can I do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Moved in with my boyfriend of 7 months too soon. Now I feel trapped, miserable and I'm financially dependant on him. I can't rearrange the furniture, or buy what I want, or do what I want and I have 0 privacy and I'm going crazy. He says if he has to move out then we have to breakup because we can't live separately and still be together. What the heck do I do?

 **Edit** I should add that its a very small one bedroom apartment and finding a roommate isn't gonna be easy considering that they'd have to sleep in the livingroom. My apartment is right beside my college and theres like 5 bus routes around me so its such a convenient spot I really don't wanna move :'(

 **Edit#2** This is a popular topic. BEFORE Ray moved on, I had more than enough hours to afford my apartment. But once my boss found out I was going to school he cut me back from 40 to 12 (if I was lucky) out of spite so I went from being able to save 200$ a month to maybe 20$ if I was lucky. And then, once school started, my savings were already cut in half from having to rely on it because of hour decreases, and my loans weren't that big so I ended up running out of money fairly quickly."

I work in a casino and this particular customer is slowly ruining my life.  

She is part of a group booking that brings in a lot of regular income, so banning seems unlikely. She's been in multiple times before things started getting this nasty and has been vile to me every single time to the point where I've left in tears after every shift.

The first time she kicked off, she threw her cards into my face and I asked her not to because it was rude, she went mental and started telling everyone that I swore at her and insulted her.  

The next time she came in, she called over the manager and made a formal body hygiene complaint, which resulted in me being taken into the managers office where they told me how to wash properly, which is standard procedure, but was humiliating.  

However last night she came in, and was screaming it across the room. She was holding her perfume bottle under her nose pretending to urge, going over to the windows saying she was going to faint from my smell, saying it's ruined her day. She then spent the 8 hours of my shift going up and telling every single staff member and customer how bad it was.  

However, I couldn't smell anything, I had fresh uniform and had showered before my shift, and the managers said, 'I smell very faintly of fresh sweat, but what do you expect when someone's working in a hot room for 8 hours?' They privately asked other customers who were sat next to me, and they said the same thing, very faint fresh sweat and they didn't understand what she was complaining about. But she complained as soon as I sat down at the start of my shift.  

Now, I don't know how people perceive casinos, but they are disgusting places. Its full of people who spend all day playing online, don't wash (by their own admission!), and then come in and play all night. We've had people come in with three day baby sick covered tops, it is a disgusting place and that's what we thought she was smelling last time.  

But she has gone round to every single staff member and customer complaining, and now even though I know there was little truth to the complaint, I'm too mortified to go back to work tomorrow. I've been crying all day and had multiple showers and washed my uniform many times.   

I love this job more than anything and it'll be difficult to find anything that fits around my life like this job does.  

Has anyone got any advice? Or even some kind words would be helpful, please.  

Tl;Dr: Customer at work has been consistently vile to me, but last night made a show about 'how bad I smelt' for 8 hours, going up and telling every staff member and customer. I smelt faintly of fresh sweat, but now I'm so mortified I don't want to go back to work tomorrow and face everybody after that.

"[M22] How to tell my GF [24] her friends are not nice people?


Throwaway account as I know she browses Reddit.

So a bit of backstory, I met my GF after she worked in a local store and we would get chatting everytime I went in (which became everyday after we got chatting) til I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out. Everything has been going amazing for 5 months, we see each other almost everyday and we have both met each other's families and get on really well. She came out with me and a few friends at New year's for a party and they all loved her too which was great...

But I had never met any of her friends, I thought maybe she didn't have any which is fine so didn't want to ask. She then invited me to come shopping with 3 of her  ""best friends"" and a couple of their boyfriends. When my girlfriend was around her friends she became very quiet and reserved which I'd not really seen before. I ignored it and hung around outside with the other boyfriends who again we're not very nice people and would insult almost every girl that walked past. I got bored and said I would go look for the girls and I followed them around the shop holding bags and noticed her friends would insult her constantly. I'm not talking jokingly like I do with my guy friends I mean she would pickup clothes and they would say how awful it would look because she has fat legs and made a couple of fat jokes (she is not fat in the slightest but these girls are twigs) which she just awkwardly looked at me and then the floor. They continuously insulted her looks and attitude and even insulted my clothes a couple of times (would you insult someone you just met?) and I could see her getting visibly upset and embarrassed that I was seeing her like this. I changed the subject and said we should get food before leaving and when we got home she kind of just brushed me off and said "" I will see you tomorrow"", we said nothing more about it and met back up for a walk in the park a couple days later and she was back to her happy, bubbly self and we had a great day at the park.

But I don't know what to do, I despise her friends, they are truly awful people and I would never dare insult someone in that way and certainly not in front of their partner they are meeting for the first time. Even my closet guy friends would never insult someone in that way especially when they are clearly uncomfortable. I am just worried that if I bring it up then I might be overstepping and being too controlling, since she has been friends with these girls for years and only just met me. But they clearly upset her which I feel awful about,  this is still a new relationship though and I don't want to ruin it over something like this.

She has asked for me to come out to dinner with that same group of friends and I really don't want to, I am making every excuse not to go because I know they will say something that will upset my GF and I will lose my temper and most likely end up looking like the asshole.

Should I just ignore it or should I maybe ask why she is friends with them because they are so mean to her?

TLDR: My GFs friends use her as an emotional punching bag and I don't know if I should point it out."

"After supporting my (28f) bf (27m) through law school he was cheating with another woman need help dealing


Sorry for the typos in advance, i am writing this from my phone and feel so sick to my stomach right now but please help me. I need advice and reassurance that things will be better because Ive never felt so worthless in my life ever. 


My bf and I have been dating almost 6 years. Inthis time I found a great job in the restaurant business managing after working my way up from the bottom. My boyfriend and I moved in together shortly after he was accepted to law school. During this time we helped each other so much but especially for him I sacrificed a lot. I was the one making sure there was food on the table, planning fun events for us and just in general being supportive foe him when he needed it. Pack him lunches, review his papers, the whole 9 yards....i devoted myself to him because i loved him and i thought he loved me too. 


Well, a few hours ago I found a text that popped up in his locked home screen that said ""something for your dreams"" with a winky face. Of course I opened it to see, because there was no way that was platonic at all. Sure enough there is a naked photo of another woman, with a huge string of text messages dating back to almost TWO years ago. There was no evidence of them ever meeting or making plans but there was a lot of sexy messages and hundreds of nudes exchanged. 


Ny boyfriend at first was defiant and then denied everything and once I began crying he started to cry as well. He promises that it was just him being collosally dumb and filled with ego, wanting sexy messages feom other women ... but we have sex regularly and I thought we were good together and headed for marriage. He just got a job lined up with a good firm for this summer as well, and now I feel like a complete loser 


Do i forgive him? Weve been dating almost 6 years and he insists he loves me and has eyes for only me and immediately blocked and deleted all traces of said woman (i dont know if there are more) but I feel like a HUGE LOSER. I feel ive been pouring myself into helping him be the best possible person he can be during his time of stress even when I was tired with my job just to have him shower affections on another woman . He rarely calls me by nice names but he was telling her she was striking, beautiful, a goddess...tht also hurt me so much. 


Ive just kicked him out for the night and am alone in our place. He is blowing up my phone asking me to meet to talk tomorrow, begging for a second  chance. I have so many emotions running through my head right now. Where do I start? I know, ive been had. Im a chump. Please help. How do you even begin to process a betrayal like this ? I can't face my friends or family yet. They all were rooting for us to be engaged by the end of this year. 



Tldr: helped support boyfriend through law school while working fulltime myself, just found out today he was messaging another woman sexually for the past two years. I have no idea where to begin to process this."

"My mom (40 F) is addicted to her phone and it is ruining not only her 25 year marriage but the whole family in general, what can I do?


I don't know where else to ask this so I hope this is okay. For the past 4 years my mother's phone addiction has gradually increased. She was always on Facebook 24/7 and still is. She is obsessed with social media: has Facebook, Whatsapp, Tango, Instagram, and Snapchat, but has my siblings and I blocked in them. When we were not blocked, all she would ever post was complains about my father, how she's always locked in the house (she is not), and she would constantly upload selfies and flirt with guys who commented. 

One year I ended up getting into her Facebook and I found messages where she is talking to other men on there, them being my father's cousins and one being my cousin's husband. Eventually, she reset her password and I got logged out. Now I can't see anything at all. I go to visit and all my mom does is look at her phone. We go to church, she's on it, we're eating, she's on it. It's gotten to the point where no one can touch her phone. Anytime I tried going near it she screamed or said she needed to text my brother, my dad recently grabbed her phone and she scratched the crap out of his arm, while trying to take it away from him (keep in mind that she has a passcode that no one knows).

 I have four brothers and the three youngest are being affected by her behavior alot. She acts like a teenager and doesn't pay any attention to my siblings, the youngest is 2 years old. My father has spoken to me and has decided to leave my mother because it's obvious that she is hiding something (his relatives have been telling him about her social media posts), he called my mom to tell her since she is not in town ( all of a sudden decided to go to kansas randomly &amp; took the 2 youngest siblings with her), she then calls me claiming that my dad is going crazy. I finally decided to tell her exactly how I felt and how everyone else feels, her response was "" You're not thinking right, I'll call you in the morning once you get some sleep."" 

Is there anything else I can do to help her understand that her phone is affecting her, has anyone else experienced this? 
TL;DR Not sure how to get my mom to stop using her phone constantly

Update: my mom is not in a bad situation guys, we are not some kind of family cult and she chose to be a mom at the age of 17. She mentions that she is locked in the house for ATTENTION. Not once did i put that she is because she is NOT. "
