"UPDATE Me [31F] with my friend [39M], been good friends for two years. I have cancer and am not going to live a whole lot longer. Should I tell him I have feelings for him even though nothing is going to come of it, probably?

I told him.

Last night, after we spent a really great day together where I had enough energy to do everything I wanted, I told him ""Friend's name, I wanted you to know I love you. I don't need anything from you. Just love you. And if circumstances were different, we could have been amazing together....""

He was holding a bag for me while we were waiting for our car, and he dropped it and blinked a few times and said something like ""I know...I know and I don't want to stop spending time with you. I don't know what this is. It feels weird and guilty but I hate being away from you. You are all I think about."" He hugged me and told me he loved me (that isn't new, we do that). I told him I love him too. We cried a little. Then we got in the car.

Once we got back to mine we watched some nature docs and just...held each other. It was so nice. He is still here. I don't know what any of this means lol. I wish this were more climactic for you guys, but honestly I am over the moon. Just having told him.

Tl;Dr: I told him last night. He hasn't gone home yet. I think we are just going to go day by day for now and see what happens? Thank you all so much for the kind words and love.

ETA: I wanted to add this message, thanks /u/aromatichydrocarbons.


Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could."" - Louise Erdrich

Thank all of you so much for taking the time to comment. Go love each other. Life is so short.

"UPDATE My (M/42) GF (F/36) of 2 years; she says she likes to be ""taken"", I've more of a mutual consent type


[Original post] 
(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6tntf0/my_m42_gf_f36_of_2_years_she_says_she_likes_to_be/)


When I made my original post, I was feeling at an impasse and thinking I was going to end a relationship I valued, only because our sex life was starting to slacken.  Initial responses were confirming this fear ""oh you have a dead bedroom... bail on that""


Then I got a few comments about our poor communication, which I kindof knew... but also about how my perception of what my GF was saying she wanted (being taken) was in fact me being stubborn about what I thought it would make me to fulfill that role for her.  


I think, being my age, I get prone to thinking I know a lot.. but in some aspects, I'm as stupid/innocent about things as it can get.  


Prior to the post, I was pretty strict about ""anytime someone utters no, that is full stop"".  I haven't changed the spirit of this - but the comments also lead me to understand that sometimes knowing that you drive a person so crazy they just can't keep their paws off you, lead me to realize I do in fact feel that way about my GF - and that I was intentionally suppressing something that she likely really wanted to feel.


Since the post, the next time we went out, I intentionally was oogling her and telling her ways I was attracted to how she was behaving, looking.  I also took a quick second to tell her that I've been thinking about our bedroom issues and that I decided upon a safe word that she could use later if needed... I told her the word, then went back to smirking at her as I looked her up and down and... she was just radiant about it.  She lit up with smiles and I literally could just tell I had said exactly the right thing to her.  


I'm a ""physical touch"" person and I just notice when she gives more than not - but her contact frequency with me has been outstanding since then (it had dwindled).  Our bedroom situation has shifted to zero complaints for me as well - but our general connection just seems to be a complete reverse from where I felt it was.


I don't think my original post gained much attention, but I wanted to post an update to thank those who took the time to respond and help me out.  This literally took the best possible direction for me - better than I had hoped for in fact.  It wouldn't have been possible without those who took time to respond.


As for me, I already knew there are things I'm ignorant about, but it was another good lesson to realize I can be a stubborn asshole and become too entrenched without realizing it.  The next time I feel like I'm facing an impossible issue with someone I care about, that is going to be one of the first things I take a serious look at.


As people had pointed out, she was telling me what she wanted (if not 100% direct, she was communicating it).  I also think she wasn't listening to me either - but there was enough there to align us back together to where now I'm very happy with us again.

Chemo is very, very not sexy.  So it's not like I think I'll tell him and he'll be like ""oh god, let's bone right here!"" or he'll make some grand gesture about having a relationship with me til my time comes.  That isn't what I want, nor why I want to do it.  

I get really sad when I think about dying without telling him how I feel.  We've always had ridiculous chemistry, we were just never single at the same time while I was still healthy.  


tl;dr: Should I tell him I'm in love?  How?  And since I don't think there's going to be a lot of time left or that he would want to be with me anyway...is this a good idea?

"My boyfriend (32M) cringes when I get undressed?


My boyfriend (32M) and I (30F) have been dating almost 2 years. Our sex life is very lackluster.. maybe 1-2 times a month, sometimes more, sometimes we go months without.. he says it's entirely him and has nothing to do with me..

Recently I've started noticing he makes faces when I undress.. Last night I was especially hurt.. I like to sleep in just a shirt, no pants or underwear. I got out of bed for something and caught him looking at downstairs. As soon as I looked at his face, he wrinkled his nose and pinched/rubbed it.. imagine if you saw someone who had just smelled something bad.. that is the best way to describe it.

I don't smell, I had just showered and used lotion. everything was groomed. 

I'm a little overweight, but by no means huge.. he's always told.me how beautiful I am and attractive I am to him..

this wasn't the first time.. this has happened many times. if I'm undressing.. he either doesn't look, sneaks a peak and makes a face, or awkwardly smiles at me..

I've mentioned it before to him, his faces and he says he doesn't do that, and to not put any faith in body language, he says it's not a real science.. and yet he talks about microexpressions and rewinds videos to point them out. He says, sometimes his nose itches, t doesn't mean anything. Am I vastly over analyzing this?

He talks about marriage to me.. but this small thing is ruining our relationship for me. I am embarrassed to undress now. I'm afraid to sleep naked. what should I do?

TL:DR Boyfriend makes unconscious faces when he sees me naked.. like grimacing, pinching/running his nose.. makes me very self conscious.

EDIT: wow.. this got a lot of attention.. to answer the main question I keep seeing..

My bf prefers we sleep naked. he likes the skin contact when we cuddle. There have been many times he has asked me to take my pants off to feel my legs and butt. He has also gone to bed many times in just a shirt and free-balling. So I don't think it's the t-shirt/no pants combo. However, he IS rather prudish. He's never been one to talk really openly about sex. However he is also very okay being naked in front of me (not shy at all), so I wouldn't see how he could be okay with himself but not okay with others nudity? 

Maybe it COULD be just vaginas? I could start wearing a T-shirt and thong and see if it changes anything.. that never even occurred to me.


Also, I'm 99% sure he isn't closet gay. I've seen his porn and he is also from a very accepting family with a transgender brother. "
"[Update] I [19F] spoke to my parents [48F &amp; 53M] about not wearing the hijab.


[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6q4u1b/i_19f_want_to_tell_my_mom_48f_that_i_dont_want_to/) to original post.

Hi Reddit! I've received a few requests to make a follow-up posts, so I'm back! Before I start, I want to thank everyone for their kindness and their support. Some of you guys gave me some really great advice, and I honestly couldn't thank you enough. Of course, there were a few trolls in my last post, and I want to go off topic for a bit to tell any prospective assholes to *please* stay off my posts. The anti-muslim rhetoric these days has really shaken me up, and I deal with plenty in real life without you guys bringing it online.

About three weeks ago- the Saturday after I made my original post- I sat down with my mom and I told her about how I didn't want to wear the hijab. I like to think that it wasn't a complete surprise, because I've definitely been loosening it up over the past few years, but it was still a painful conversation. We both cried and said some very painful things, but our first conversation ended at an impasse. The next day, we sat down and had a very honest discussion. I told her that I loved and respected both her and our religion, but the hijab was ultimately my decision and she couldn't force me. She agreed, but with the stipulation that I participate in events at our mosque more often and make more religious friends- which is a fair enough compromise, so I agreed.

Talking to my dad was a little harder, because we're not very close, but he was pretty calm and understanding throughout. He told me that even though no one on his side of the family wore the hijab, he liked it when I did because he always saw it as a good thing. Ultimately, he left the decision up to me, but asked that I wear it to family events for a little while so that people wouldn't get the wrong idea.

I'm not going to say my mom and I are 100% okay, but she's handling it remarkably well. We'll go out and shop together, or hang out around the house and just talk and she won't treat me any differently. After those first two days, we haven't really had an in-depth conversation about me wearing the hijab, but she does ask that I wear it around certain people for now so that people won't unnecessarily gossip. I completely understand, because my mom is a pretty well-known figure in our community, and I would never want my decisions to reflect poorly on her. We both agreed that I'll handle it in phases, and that I'm not going to wear it at college or at work or when I'm with my friends, but family and mosque events need me to be more covered-up. I actually move in to college tomorrow, so wish me luck with that!

It's a little silly, but now that I'm not wearing the hijab I have so many inane problems to deal with. I completely skipped 9 years worth of haircare experience, so I have NO idea how to style it, or what to do other than just throwing it up into a ponytail. I've definitely noticed that people treat me differently, too. Service people at stores are a lot more friendly and I've gotten cat-called a few times (which is really uncomfortable, but I guess that's life?) I'm also a little nervous about posting stuff to instagram, or changing my social media profile pictures, because not a lot of people know yet, but I figure I'll take things as I go. Once more, I want to thank all of you guys for your kindness and support!

TL;DR I spoke to my parents about not wearing the hijab, and they took it pretty well. I'm a little nervous about how people are going to react, but also excited to see where this decision takes me."

"My friend [25F] is mad at me [24F] and other friends [20sM&amp;F] for going to a festival without her, even though she was invited but turned it down to go do something else.


Lola and I have been friends for a few years now, and she has always been a good friend... except for this. 

Last weekend, me and a group of our friends drove up to a music festival in a different country. We've been planning this for months, booked everything as soon as the tickets went on sale, and had a blast. I was driving most of the way so I only looked at my phone during rest stops, and saw that my friend Lola texted me ""Thanks for the invite to the roadtrip..."" with a bunch of angry emojis. I texted back saying that we were on our way to the music festival and that I hoped she had a good weekend at hers. MONTHS ago when we were planning this trip, I asked Lola if she wanted to come with us and she turned me down, saying she wanted to attend a smaller festival closer to our state. She just responded ""oh."", and has been ignoring/one wording me over text since.

This makes me mad - we did invite her (twice actually), she just chose to do something else, and is treating us like we betrayed her for doing the thing we said we would do without her. This is a common theme in gatherings without Lola - she's a huge introvert, well known in our group for coming to parties and leaving without saying goodbye when she needs alone time. She's told us before that she hates going out to bars and clubs, so she never comes out with us unless it's a special occasion (not a bad thing, just showing how she likes to socialize), but if we post a group picture from a night out that she chose not to attend, she'll comment something passive aggressive on it and then ignore whoever posted it for a while.

Lola has confided in me about her struggle with social anxiety before, which is why she cancels at the last minute or dips midway through a party without saying goodbye, and I understand that, but is it unsympathetic of me to think that doesn't her the right to treat us like we're doing something wrong when we do something without her? Other friends have told me that they're getting tired of always being turned down when they ask her to hang out, but when they don't invite her to something she obviously would not be into (eg. ribfest - Lola is a vegan), she flies off the handle. Any thoughts on this? Lola's really sweet and fun when she wants to be, but I'm sick of this passive aggressiveness. 

tl;dr: Friend with social anxiety lashes out at us when our friend group goes to events without her, even though she declines invitations left right and centre. Not sure what to do from here.

"Update: My [f21] mom [f53] lied to me about my brother [m30's] coming to Thanksgiving.


Link to [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5epjcj/my_f21_mom_f53_lied_to_me_about_my_brother_m30s/) post.

So, I ended up toughing it out that day, tried to avoid any confrontation, and generally, tried not to break my mother's heart because in the end I love her dearly; I understood we were both in a tough spot. It ended up being an okay holiday, my brother behaved and we were all fine. I thought maybe he straightened himself up a little and realized he had made a mistake. He had even held down a job and told me he was really good at it. For a brief moment, I was proud of how mature I thought both of us had become.

Welp, I was wrong. Six months later, my brother's girlfriend was blowing up my mother's phone asking her to get my brother out of jail, **because he had beaten the snot out of her.** Needless to say, my mother didn't answer. That may sound cruel, but I feel the need to add context to fully encapsulate why this was an important step for my mother.

I get it, people make mistakes sometimes. When it comes to my brother, he has been nothing but violent his whole life. He's tried to fight my father (we have different dads), he's fought his own brother, he's been sent away for 'accidental' manslaughter, he's beaten all three of his ex-fiancees, he's pinned my ex down to pound his head into the dirt, he's smashed phones that I used to record his behavior for proof that my family felt endangered, and finally, he's hit me in the face for trying to stop him from doing something I know he'll regret. My brother is a monster, and there's no hope for him anymore. He's not the same person I knew and loved.

Every day for the last thirty years, my mother gave up time from her social and business life to answer his beck and call. If he was in jail, she'd bail him out. If he had a warrant for his arrest, he could hide out in my mom's house for a couple days before he left state. Because of him, the last twenty years of my life were barren because my mother was busy coddling him because she felt everything was her fault. She couldn't reason out that maybe, in the end, some people are just born with disorders that make them the way they are. Sometimes, people *like* that they have a condition that causes them to manipulate the people around them.

For ten years, I watched her fall into depression and misplaced anger because she felt useless because every time my oldest brother, the psychopath, didn't get his way, he'd scream and yell at her till she broke herself to get it. I couldn't tell you how many TVs and how many pieces of jewelry were never retrieved from a pawn shop. My mom will never see the engagement ring she got from my father again in her lifetime. 

On that day though, she didn't pick up the phone. My brother's girlfriend screamed into voicemail and posted on Facebook about how she was a horrible mother and that you shouldn't abandon your children. She blocked her page and her number, she got a new personal number, and she works somewhere different now. My brother has no way of reaching her besides the internet. She doesn't use it much anymore.

I've never seen my mother so relaxed. I can tell she's hurting and that she feels like this is her fault but inside I know she's making peace with it. She comes up to my town to see me every couple of months, she can afford her rent, and she doesn't have to sacrifice every part of herself to keep someone happy anymore. Seeing my mom this way has lifted so much guilt and stress off of me. I've hung out with her more in the past couple months than I have in fifteen years. In the end, honestly, I'm really glad she didn't answer that call.

My advice to anyone going through a situation similar, don't wait for the abuse to end. Don't think it's okay just because they're ""family"". You can make a family anywhere. You can make one at work, at school, with your friends, even with a group you do activities with. Blood means nothing if someone abuses it, you're always free to step away from a situation if you fear for your mental state, safety, or your life. Sometimes it takes longer to get out because of complications and that's okay. You can always find a way.

Thank you, Reddit, you've improved my life to the fullest it can be.
I don't know if I'll ever be able to thank you enough.

Hey r/relationships,

After many online dates and flings, I finally met someone I liked two weeks ago. He's a really sweet guy and although I wouldn't say I'm in love with him, I think I am really starting to fall for him pretty hard.

A few days into seeing him, I asked him about his last relationship and he told me that she broke up with him a few months back (she cheated on him and then said something about wanting to grow and see other ppl, etc) and that he was over her. However, they hung out about a month ago; apparently, she asks him for favors a lot and although he does not really want to do them and wants to cut contact, he feels bad for her. I didn't think much of it at first because, in my last breakup, my ex-boyfriend helped me a ton because I was unemployed and we had pets together so it was rough for me to transition. 

While we were starting to get more serious about dating, I guess he told her that he was seeing me and that he wanted to stop talking to her. She called him over fifty times on our last date and started to plead with him via text and email to take her back. He ignored all her calls, and one of her friends reached out to him to tell her that it was best if he stopped responding to her and that she was going to seek mental help. 

A few days went by with no incident but I just got an email from her begging me to stop dating him and that she desperately wants him back in her life and that she would appreciate it if I didn't tell him about it. She wasn't threatening in the email, and she seemed pretty self-aware that she sounded pretty desperate. I honestly feel really sad for her because the guy I am seeing is really amazing. But beyond that, I'm a little scared. Why did this girl think it was a good idea to email me? I mean, it doesn't take much for someone to find out who I am (I freelance and have my own website so my contact info is out there), but I honestly don't know if it's worth dealing with. 

What do I do? Do I tell him I got this email? Should I try to answer her? I honestly do feel for her because I have been heartbroken and lost as well, but I don't think I'd ever go to the extremes that she has in dealing with it. I would love to hear anyone else's take on this and if they have experienced this before.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I got an email from a 'crazy' ex girlfriend asking me to stop dating the guy I'm seeing. I really like him but we've only been together for a few weeks and I don't know if I want to deal with this.

EDIT: I forgot to mention to this (and I am surprised I forgot about this). I am assuming that she may have threatened to hurt herself over this in her communications with him, which is why I'm worried and cautious as well. My understanding is that she doesn't have many friends around the area. He has resolved to cut contact, but I'm just worried that maybe we should be doing something else/more. 

---
EDIT 2: I told him. He was apologetic and asked me what he needed to do. We both decided to keep ignoring her and hope that she will eventually tire out. He hasn't fully blocked her just in case she does decide to harm herself. She is currently under somewhat supervised care and isn't in town anymore *phew.* If it keeps bothering me I think I will ask him to actually block her, but it really doesn't at this point. Thanks everyone!"

"My [23F] husband's [27M] public angry outbursts are starting to get me into trouble. I'm afraid one day he'll piss off the wrong person and we'll both be in danger.


My husband has been dealing with explosive anger issues for a long time - I'm starting to think that this goes beyond the time period that I've even known him. We've been fighting a lot and there has been verbal abuse going on. I've alerted a couple of close family and friends recently to what's going on and I am deeply considering what my next move is. 

In the meantime, though, there is another problem. The anger is not confined to behind closed doors. It's starting to spill over into public situations. It started with berating me in public a couple times, bringing our arguments into the street or the grocery store, whatever. Now it's getting worse. His anger isn't just directed at me - it's directed at the world in general, and it's getting me into trouble.

Today, for instance, he got into a fight with a taxi driver. He had asked the driver to make a quick stop at the ATM on our route home. The driver told us that he would charge extra for that - more than 25% extra, which is steep. My husband started yelling and swearing at the driver, and told me that he'd get out and meet me at home, and I could take the taxi home. But he slammed the door on his way out, leading the taxi driver to turn the car off, get out, and start yelling at my husband. Then the driver kicked me out and said he didn't want to take me home, and he left me on the side of the road in the heat with all of my grocery bags. I get it in a way, because I wouldn't want to deal with that shit on the job. But I didn't do anything wrong except being married to an abuser, and I had to pay the consequences for it. 

I'm afraid that situations like this will become more common, and that his outbursts will one day piss off the wrong person and put us both in serious danger. He's from a culture where fights are solved in the street, on the spot, with fists and loud voices, but in my culture, you'll get arrested for assault for doing that.

"I [22 m] am having very confusing romantic feelings for my best friend [21 m]. Am I totally insane?


Throwaway because best friend knows my normal account.

Ok, so I hardly even know where to begin with this. Jason and I have been best buds since middle school. We got close pretty fast. We've both had girl friends but nothing has lasted more than a year for either of us. He moved with me to new city when I went off to university (his family sucks and he doesn't have much contact with them, he says I'm his family) and we lease an apartment together. 

I'd say over the past year or so my feelings have gotten increasingly complicated. We do pretty much everything together. We make meals together when we can. We go out a lot just the two of us. Heck we even have a dog together. It's technically mine, but Jason shares the responsibilities with me.

I know things aren't quite normal between us, and a lot of you will probably think we're weird, but we often share a bed.  I feel this is mostly out of convenience though. We like talking. We always chat before bed. One of us will always go to the others room. Half the time we are both on Reddit just showing each other random shit before falling asleep.

We cuddle. Sometimes on the couch, sometimes in bed. We hold hands sometimes and we hug fairly frequently. The hand thing we don't do in public, nor the cuddling thing for that matter.

Before we leave we always say bye and that we love each other. The love thing started out as a joke, but now it's always and Jason will even say it to me before hanging up the phone. He always insists he loves me more.

Like honest to fucking god it feels like I'm already in a relationship with this dude and we just haven't kissed or banged yet. 

I've noticed myself getting increasingly jealous when he talks about girls or hooks up with one from tinder. It feels like I *hate* these girls even though I don't even know them.

At this point I don't even think about girls myself, I just think about Jason and it's driving me mad. I want him. Worse I want him to want me back. I swear half my day is spent thinking about boning this dude and I'm not even sure what would go where between the two of us. It's the dumbest situation I've ever found myself in.

It's not just sex I want with him though. It's everything. I'm in love with this guy and I haven't the faintest fucking clue how it happened. 

Lately I've been thinking of making a move on him. Kissing him or something. I don't know! This is probably the worst idea ever. I'd be so screwed if he took it badly.

I don't know Reddit. What the hell do I do? I think he's got to have caught feelings too, right? Or maybe I'm just telling myself that because of how badly I want him. Jesus, I'm so damn lost.

Any advice and outside perspective would be very much appreciated.



**tl;dr** I have some serious feelings for my best friend. Should I make a move or not?

"My grandfather [98 M] got a new girlfriend [80s F] and she's absolutely miserable.


My grandfather has always been sharp as a tack despite his age. Once my grandmother passed away in October 2014, he talked with my father (who been inadvertently put in charge of all of this and is the main point of contact) and uncles and they all decided it would be best for him to move into an assisted living home. The home they found is absolutely lovely--he gets his own little apartment that doesn't look at all like a dreary hospital room. The staff is wonderful, the food is great (I've had some), and the services offered are outstanding.

When he first moved in, he still had access to his car. As time went on, he felt his age catching up with him, and told my father that he doesn't want to drive anymore. He asked my father to hold on to the car keys for him, and he would start taking the shuttle or calling my dad if he needed to go anywhere. So my dad took the keys.

In comes my grandfather's new girlfriend, Mary. At first it was kind of weird because my grandmother had only recently died and they'd been married for almost 70 years. But, it was understandable that my grandfather wanted some companionship, so we all welcomed her.

At first she seemed sweet but now she's absolutely MISERABLE. She's your textbook cranky old lady. She bashes the home regularly, saying it's like a prison there. She gets upset when we all come to visit my grandfather and take him out. She tells us that we're awful for taking the keys from my grandfather, even though it was originally my grandfather's suggestion. His memory is starting to go now, so he's also starting to blame my father for taking his keys, and she just eggs him on. Now when we come to visit him, all he does is complain and act resentful towards us , which he has never done before.

I seriously hate her. She acts like she know him better than we do, and scolds my dad for making decisions that she doesn't like, even though they are in my grandfather's best interest. I think because she spends more time with him than we do, she's filling his head with negative thoughts about his family and it's seriously affecting his mood and overall well being. I want to call her out and tell her to fuck off but I know I can't. I hate what she's doing to my grandfather, I hate the toll it's having on my father, and I don't want to have to always act like I'm happy to see her. 

I want to pull her aside and tell her how much her negativity is affecting my grandfather, my dad, and the rest of my family. How should I go about this conversation? Is this even a conversation worth having?

"My [24F] husband [26M] always disrespects me and humiliates/undermines me in front of others. He just called me lazy in front of our guests for a party I arranged for him.


My husband, Mike, and I have been together for 3 years and married for one. He was always a loving, caring man who was perfect in very way. Only recently (about 6 months ago) did he began ragging on me constantly. 

Here are some examples:

1.) In February we vacationed with his parents and his mom complimented my body as I've been doing Pilates. My husband then goes ""Yeah, and she was just talking about getting implants- how dumb"". A.) that was a private conversation between my husband and I and he shouldn't have shared it. B.) He said it with such disgust- it was embarrassing. Later that night I told him that was a private conversation and he said ""who wasn't going to notice you going from a B to a D cup? That's not a secret"". Only the next morning did he actually apologize for it.

2.) I opened up a hair salon which took a lot of time, money, and effort. I do not have a partner- I operate every aspect of it. I have 4 stylists and I recently stopped doing hair myself so now a couple times a week I work from home (forwarding calls to my cell). We met mutual friends for happy hour not too long ago and my boyfriend starts saying all I do is ""answer phones"" and complain about the stress in my life when really I do ""nothing"". Our mutual friends stood up for me but I was embarrassed and irked. He does this often. 

3.) He frequently comments on my schedule as if it's less significant than his. He does respect my Pilates schedule, my time with friends, etc. meanwhile he has guys night set in stone but expect me to be flexible with my plans.

Tonight:

My husband recently got promoted so we invited 15 of our friends (mostly other couples) for a little get together. I worked from home while Mike was at work as usual. I cleaned, bought groceries, cooked, made some spiked drinks, etc. It took all of today and yesterday to set up not to mention following up on invites and such. People started arriving at 5pm- around 6pm we were grilling steaks. I asked Mike to check the steaks and in front of all our guest he said ""Wow she's too lazy check the steaks at my own party"". They all kind of ragged on him and teasingly told him to check the steaks.

Now I'm upstairs because I needed to decompress. I'm so upset I don't even want to go back downstairs. I don't know how to hy through to him. I've told him feeling disrespected lately and he just feels attacked and it's not productive. He says ""if I were to keep track of everything you blurt out I could say the same"". But he doesn't give me examples and I have always been careful with my words.

I really don't know how to handle this. It's embarrassing honestly.

Tldr: my husband humiliates me in front of others. How to handle this?"

"My [26F] roommate [22M] insisted on having the master bedroom, now that he has it, he insists on sleeping in the living room


Two weeks ago, I moved from an apartment into a house rental with my roommate. The master bedroom in the house we are renting is huge, literally twice the size, maybe more of the other two bedrooms in the house, and has its own bathroom. It also gets much sunnier than the other bedrooms because it has way more windows and is on a side of the house that gets a lot of sunlight. I naturally wanted this bedroom for a number of reasons. 

For one, I have a king size 5 peice bedroom-set that takes up a lot of space, the entirety of which can't fit into either of the other two bedrooms. My roommate only has a two 5 drawer chests, which are mostly empty. I have a lot more clothing and belongings in general than he does, and I need the space. 

Another reason that I wanted the master bedroom is that I spend way more time in my room than he does. I'm a fairly introverted person who is easily distractable and needs relative quiet and calm to concentrate properly. I'm also in the process of learning two languages as well as studying for various CLEP exams, so I need to concentrate quite a lot. Becuse of the fact that my roommate is one of those people who is literally uncomfortable being in the house without the tv on, I have to study in my room whenever he's home.

The last reason why I thought it was ony fair that I have the master bedroom, is because my roommate is the complete opposite of me when it comes to his room. Even in the last place we lived in, he basically  lived in the living room. He even had an extra bed that he kept in the living room to sleep on. His actual bedroom was basically a glorified closet, since he *literally* only ever went in there to change his clothes. At the old place, we had a running joke that I slept in his bedroom more often than he did.

Despite all of these reasons, which I expressed to him before we moved into the new place and he understood, he insisted on having the master bedroom. After a few days of debating, I gave in and let him have the room. He assured me that he would actually use the bedroom this time instead of living in the living room like he did at the old place. 

Well, as I'm sure you know if you read the title, he lied. We've been in this place for over two weeks, and he still has yet to spend a full night in his bedroom. Our third bed is in our guest bedroom, so now he sleeps on the couch with a comforter. Both of my side tables are also in the guest room, because they don't actually fit in my room with my king sized bed and the rest of my furniture, which still, even without the other two peices, barely fits in the room. I'm crammed into one of the darkest rooms in the house for basically no reason because he still spends literally every waking and non-waking hour in the living room. 

I'm so irritated and angry about this situation but I have no idea know what to do. I feel like I have no right to complain at this point since I let him have the room, but I can't help but feel like I got played and it really pisses me off. What do I do, if anything, about this?

TL;DR - My roommate insisted on taking the bedroom that is much bigger and nicer by a long shot  that the other two bedrooms. He now spends all of his time in the living room, he even sleeps there. I'm really annoyed because I wanted that bedroom and would have used it way more as I have to spend a lot of time in my room as a result of him being in the living room so much. "
"My [18F] mom [63F] has been living vicariously through me and has been a helicopter parent all my life to the point that she impersonates me through emails to my teachers and contests.


First time poster and throwaway Bc my mom goes through my phone every so often. Sorry it's so long. 

I'll start with a little back story for context. My mom is an incredibly smart woman who had a very hard child/early adulthood. Her own mother cheated on her father which resulted in her family falling apart. She has a very toxic relationship with her sisters, who she ceased contact with when I was child, and I've only just now reconnected with them and their children. She's been ""working on"" her PhD for the past 30 yrs, and doesn't seem to understand that in the field she's working in, she needs a PhD to be taken seriously. She complains about how she can't get a job any where, meaning that she can't find the exact job she wants. She takes the resulting stress out on the people in the form of flying into incredible rages over small things like the dishes not being done (we have a dish washer, but it's been broken for 5 years Bc she insists she will fix it and refuses to hire someone to fix it). 

She had me later in life. I was an IVF baby, and I know that the pregnancy was really hard on her and my biological father at time, and led to their divorce. She really wants me to do well, which is her main excuse for many of the things she does. She always wanted the best out of me, and doesn't really except anything less. If I ""fuck up"" somehow, she constantly reminds me about it as sort of a way to ""encourage"" me to do better. When I was in 7th grade, I made a science fare project that made it to the regional competition. At the same time, I was in the middle of tech week in a production of Macbeth, and I was getting home really late and was very sleep deprived. Come the day of the science fare, I was really tired and wanted to wear a particular green sweater. My mom wanted me to wear a black shirt. We got into a huge fight, and I just gave in and wore the black shirt. When we gat there, I get set up and she starts criticizing my hair Bc I didn't have time to brush that morning Bc of the fight. She started trying to fix it for me, even though I had already fixed it the way I thought it looked ok. She wouldn't stop touching me and she was saying ""you already caused enough trouble today, stop being a brat"". This resulted in me breaking down in the show room when the judges came out. I didn't make it to state, so my mom reminds me to this day about how I ""fucked up"" science fare. Flash forward 4 years to 10th grade. I had been in dance for 7 years before that Bc that's what my mom did when she was little and my sister wasn't very good at it, so I was the one who had to do it. My teacher was a very old fashioned man who was, unbeknownst to us at the time, quite sexist. Around that time I started filling out, and put on a little weight. I wasn't very good at ballet, and my mom insists to this day that I am. My teacher started making comments about my weight, and stopped putting me in certain performances. This had been going on for a while, and my mom kept saying ""oh we'll leave once you do this performance"" and then I'd do it, and we wouldn't leave. Finally, I just decided I'd had enough. I was done with being put down constantly by this man, and stopped going. My mom was furious with me, raging at me and saying how she had had a plan for me to leave ""gracefully"" and how I had fucked it all up. This is another event in my life she constantly reminds me of. An event that was super damaging to me that being reminded of it constantly brings back all the bad feelings. As punishment for all the infractions, she won't let me get a drivers license, Bc she knows how much it means to me, and it forces me to be dependent on her for transportation. 

She was the one who set up my email address in 8th grade, and at first I was really happy. But then she had the password, and she started using it to enroll my teachers under the guise of me, resulting in me coming into class one day, and my teachers start talking about something I had no idea about. She would get into arguments with these teachers, and these teachers would hate me during the school day. I was too embarrassed to explain that it was my mom who was doing this. She also found my poetry book and started entering all of them into contests with out my consent. None of the poems were personal, it just started snowballing into her forcing me to write more so she could enter me into competitions. I think she got a thrill from the results. Now I'm going to college, and I'm afraid she will do the same thing while I'm there. Everyone in my family except for me and my stepfather [51M] went to Ivy League colleges, and this really bothers my mom. She keeps saying how I'm ""better than where [I'm] going"", and plans to reapply to the Ivies this coming year as me. She's forced me to ruin my summer taking SAT classes (classes I wanted to take last summer, but she yelled at me to not bother her about it). 

Among all this, I have unmedicated ADHD and I think my mom's actions have given me anxiety and depression, but I don't know Bc she refuses to take me to a psychiatrist. Recently I've had many times when I can barely get out of bed Bc the thought of such little independence and a constant reminder of my faults is just too much to handle sometimes. I feel like my life is not my own. 

Do you guys have any advice for me? Should I cut her out of my life when I finally become more stable? Or am I just imagining things, this is normal, and I should suck it up?

Tl;dr: mom has been super overbearing in my life to the point that she does things in my name without my knowledge.

"Me [29F] With my Husband [30M] I found something on his phone


We've been together for 10 years, married for 5. Our relationship, in my opinion, is and always has been rock solid. I'm secure in the knowledge that I'm his wife and the mother of his children. We're in that comfortable stage where we love each other, and see each other as partners and teammates. There's always been total honesty and trust in our relationship. 

So for a bit more background: 

My husband is objectively waaaay out of my league. He's gorgeous and intelligent and kind. He's very charming and funny. Understandably, he gets hit on. A lot. Like constantly. He's very good about shutting women down gently. Always brings the conversation around to me and how wonderful he thinks I am. 

To give an example: When we first got together, he had a long time female friend who was pretty much obsessed with him, and decided that right after he proposed to me, his pregnant girlfriend, was the perfect time to tell him. He tried to gently shut her down and preserve the friendship. One evening she came to our house for dinner. I thought things went amazingly and was excited to start making friends with his friends (despite knowing this woman loved my husband- I tend to be a bit over positive and exciteable), until my husband woke up the next morning to a barrage of texts from her. She called me trashy, said I was the wrong woman for him, that I'm a gold digger etc. My husband calmly showed me the texts, called her, and went off her. I believe almost word for word he said ""my pregnant fiancée welcomed you into our home with open arms, and accepted you into our lives with more class and grace than you could ever hope to have. I don't like home wreckers. Don't contact me again."" 

I'm sharing this because it shows how our relationship has always been. He's always been nothing but my partner, my best friend. 

So the problem: 

We switch phones constantly. I'm not sure why- a convenience thing really. If one of us is running late and can't find our phone, we'll take the other persons, that sort of thing. So a few days ago I had his phone and he had mine. I was looking through his pictures (he had taken our oldest fishing and I was looking through the pictures he'd taken), and noticed something... weird. 

2 weeks ago, he received (or took?) very graphic nude pictures of my friend. My male friend. Honestly, im not mad or even upset. But I'm confused as hell and a little shocked. 

I have no idea how to bring this up. Or what to say. He's never shown any inkling of being interested in men. He knew at some point I'd have his phone and didn't bother deleting the pictures. He hasn't been acting weird or staying out late or hiding his phone or anything like that. But he also never mentioned this to me, despite telling me every single time a woman flirts with him etc 

So... what the hell do I do?? 

TL;DR: my husband has naked pictures of my male friend on his phone. I'm.. shocked, but not angry. "
"My [32 F] coworkers are teasing my because my husband [25 M] of four years is younger. What should I do?

"My [25F] sister [19F] moved to LA to be a dancer, she has begun to pay thousands of dollars to a church to be their intern, now she wants to spend 8k a year on their unaccredited religious 'college.' Is this a scam or a cult? What should I do, if anything?


My sister and I are kind to each other but not very close. My immediate family (including myself) are very mentally ill and fucked up, my sister is the exception, she is functional, athletic, popular and beautiful. I am extremely proud of her for thriving on her own and moving to LA for her career (she has been doing well, though she is confused about her exact path as most of us are - I'm being vague about her career just in case someone I know sees this). And I am extremely proud of her for thriving given the shit she was born into (it wasn't that bad compared to people who actually had horrific childhoods, it just was very stressful for both of us). I am not a role model of any kind, she is far more successful and basically better than me in every way edit: I just wanted to edit this to explain how it feels strange to try to parent her or guide her in any way, since I'm such a fuck up. She's been avoiding talking to me because she knows I'm an atheist (I'm not an arrogant atheist and do not think less of people for believing in whatever they believe in, I do not actively try to turn people into atheists or judge them for disagreeing with me) and she fears I will judge her for her newfound spirituality even though I've tried to be reassuring. We were not raised with any religion whatsoever but my mom has been 'spiritual.' I have no issues with that, I personally agree with a lot of Buddhist principles and have found relief in them, my mom and I discuss spiritual matters often. I don't even consider myself an atheist anymore, probably more of an agnostic. 

I was actually really glad (at first) that she found a community out there and I think religion can be a fantastic source of support and guidance for many people. I explicitly told her I supported her in the beginning several times and I talked to her about the spiritual books she had been reading and tried to be receptive to them. Then she started wanting me to watch videos of the 'preacher' of her church. The video she showed me bothered me a lot, because it basically stated that atheists were 'at war' with God and that life without God meant life without love, creativity etc. It's fair to believe what you believe, but I resent the fact that they have to insult other people's beliefs and act self-righteous about it. So I told her that I didn't want to see anymore videos and I told her why the video bothered me. She has begun to try to force my parents to start watching her preacher's sermons as well. My mom has communicated with her about how we all find answers in different things, and our beliefs are our own personal journey and can't be dictated by other people - but my sister has been acting like Jesus is the only way of life and everyone else is wrong.

The church basically seems like a church for LA hipsters to be honest - the church is called Mosaic, I have not found anything online that says they're a cult - but the Wiki page of the founder alarms me. He used to be a fashion designer or something and now it seems he's made a business out of this. His videos remind me of any Oprah-type self-help gurus. I have no problem with self-help gurus until they try to sell their vague inspirational ideas to scam people. There are little short films before his speeches (at least in this video I watched) of young, beautiful LA people next to beautiful scenery with inspirational/religious quotes over-top. Apparently a lot of famous people attend and it's fairly well-known in the area.

Even though I disagreed with the video she sent, nothing about it seems actively malicious or anything...and I highly doubt it's a cult like scientology, I just get nervous because she's so far from home and I don't know what to do.

Sometimes the line between cult and religion appears to be very thin.  But I always told my sister if she respects my beliefs I will respect hers. Recently she began texting my mom about how she wishes she would find 'Jesus,' which really freaked my mom out because we thought this church was kind of a more casual Christian interpretation that wouldn't push people to proselytize. My mom has no issues with religion in general as long as it does not harm people. Her parents were jack mormons, and so we're wary of a lot of organized religion because of how bad the Mormon church was.

My sister is going to ask my grandparents for help with money for the Mosaic ""college"" thing (our immediate family is broke, but my grandparents had a limited amount set aside for college if my sister chose to go) and my mom already told them that she would rather them save the money for actual education rather than this but I don't think it's enough. Those particular grandparents are religious so I'm worried they'll jump at the chance to send her there (sidenote: that particular grandmother tried to ambush-baptize us when we were younger without our parent's permission - I think my sister remembers me as an angry atheist because that side of the family tended to drive me insane with their conversion tactics, my uncle told me I was responsible for sending my sister to hell if I didn't convert us - I was 14 and she was 8 at the time, it left a sour taste in my mouth).

My sister already paid thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer, my mom tried to talk her out of it but it didn't' work. Since I barely talked to her I didn't feel it was my place to say anything but now I wish I did.

I don't want her to waste time and money on this. It seems like a scam to me. I want her to be happy and I am glad she has found a community - but I do not think a healthy, happy community would push their believers into spending thousands of dollars on them (but maybe they don't actively do that?).

Do you think this is a scam/cult? I'm hoping to find some people who have experience with this, or it would be amazing if anyone knows of this church and could chime in. I'm open to being wrong about my judgements. Should I say anything to her or just let it be? I would appreciate any advice.

**TL;DR** my little sister joined a seemingly progressive liberal Christian church in LA (she got baptized, she was never religious before this because our family was not). she spent thousands of dollars to be their intern this summer and wants to spend thousands more on their religious school (earning no actual college credit, 8k+ a year). Should I be more concerned? should I be trying to talk her out of this even though we are not extremely close?

**edit** Wow! I only expected a couple of replies. I am so grateful for all of your amazing responses, especially from those of you that are religious - your perspectives helped me the most because I do not want any of my residual distaste for organized religion to taint my relationship with my sister and I do whole-heartedly believe religion can be a positive force in her life and I do not want her to feel judged by me in any way. I'm compiling a lot of the advice I've found in this thread in a word document to remind myself how to approach her (this might be strange, I have a terrible memory). I'm extremely glad I made this post! Thank you guys for all the varying opinions. 

I am pretty certain Mosaic is not a cult at this point (there is a wonderful redditor that PMed me who is a former Mosaic member and they helped me understand it much better...if you're reading this, I really can't thank you enough), but they do have a tendency to pressure people into paying more money than they should - I'm comfortable in calling parts of the church an out-right scam at this point, because it does seem kind of predatory especially since my sister is a teenager who is not at all wealthy -  so once I rebuild my connection with my sister I'm going to gently nudge her in the direction of another church but I'm not going to hostile or harsh in any way, I just want to be a supportive presence in her life no matter what. She agreed to talk to me on the phone tomorrow, I will definitely be as gentle and supportive as possible (as most of you rightfully recommended) - thank you all again :) I truly appreciate it"
"I [24/f] am planning to move in with my Fiancé[26/m]. My mother [48/f] says if I do she won't me coming to the wedding. What do I do?


I'm getting married in 8 months. My fiance and I spend a lot of time together and I'm always at his place. Hanging out with our pup and having a good time. I've decided it just makes sense for us to live together since we got 8 months left, on top of everything we have an amazing relationship and hardly argue. I told my mother I want to move in with him and she has been freaking out saying I'm doing wrong and am disgusting and that she's not coming to the wedding if I move in with him. She also calls him ""that man"" now even though she really likes him a lot, I guess now she doesn't because of my plans. 

I am sad because I want her there and am her only child, I know I was too sheltered and kind of brainwashed how to think I was raised a devout Christian (which I still think I am) but I feel like God is more worried about other things than me living with my future husband, I personally don't believe it's a sin. The sad thing is that my uncle has been cheating on his wive and cohabitation with another woman and everyone treats him great,but how dare I live with the man I'm committed to. 

Now I finally am making my own decisions and this specific decision my mother hates. I really feel bad and I don't know if I should just live at home to please her or should I continue to move in with my Fiancé?

TL;DR I am moving in with my Fiancé, I told my mom and she flipped out saying I'm disgusting and sinning and that she won't be coming to my wedding. What should I do, should I live at home to please her or continue the move."

I've never met him, he lives in another country. My Dad never talks about him, or why he named us the same names. He's the silent, emotionally unavailable type. In all honestly, when I reflect on my life, he's never been a ""father figure"". He had John in a previous marriage, and eventually got a divorce. He never talks about it. 


To start, I never lived with my parents until the age of 8, I would only see them occasionally on the weekends as they lived in another town. They had preferred my relatives (Aunt and Uncle) raise me. My parents then decided to pick me up and move to the US. Right when we moved, my younger sister was born. I remember always fighting for attention when I was younger, I never had that childhood connection to either of my parents as they did not raise me until I was 8. They were very preferential to my sister over me, and I can see their connection to her as much deeper than to me years later. 

For the past 3 years when I lived away for university, my Dad would never call. We spoke to each other 6-7 times a year whenever I would come home and visit. They were always transactional conversations: ""what time is your bus coming?"", or ""how's the weather?"". I don't think he knew the courses I was taking, who my friends were or anything personal about me. Let's just say I've had deeper conversations with Uber Drivers than him. 


I remember on my birthday, I was waiting for him to call. He never did. I eventually called him but just got his voicemail. It's funny, the last time I came home he asked to me to change his SIM card on his phone, but curiosity got the best of me and I saw multiple phone calls between him and John, up to 30m in length. 


I didn't even feel anything. I'm emotionally numb to it. I don't see this man as my father. Just a man who was in my life, who provided for me financially in terms of upbringing. That's about it. Don't get me wrong, I know things could be worse, and I'm grateful for the fact that he was there...but I have no relationship with him. He isn't a ""father"".


Should I be feeling this way? I am concerned I'm unconsciously resentful about my upbringing and relationship with him that  might be affecting other aspects of my life.

"My[m/29] best friend [m/28] told the truth about my Gf's[f/27] work history to a potential new employer and she is livid I took his side


Me, my best friend ""Chad"", and my girlfriend ""Liz"" used to all work together for the same company in a very tight knit industry until about a year ago Chad got a better job with a competitor. We are all still very good friends and are very close.


A few months later our company had lost several more employees and chose to not replace them since production wasnt suffering. Without the personal to properly staff all the shifts they ""Asked"" certain veteran employees like Liz to work 12 hour shifts to maintain coverage. While working one of these 12 hour shifts with a skeleton crew, doing a job that normally requires 3 people, Liz made a simple mistake trying to do too many things at once that destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment.


There was an big internal investigation which found that A) She indeed shouldnt have been doing that task alone B) The production schedule was completely inappropriate for the shift that morning C) The machinery was so incredibly insured that the company was actually going to make money off the accident. Liz is a stellar employee with no prior issues so the management gave her a formal write up (slap on the wrist) and in a few weeks everyone had moved on and forgotten about it.


Everyone forgot about it except for Liz. It truly haunts her to this day. The company loves her and she still has plently of upwards mobility but she has become deeply embittered. She accepted responsiblity for her actions but resents the company for putting her in that position in the first place. Over that last few months she has become increasingly sad and grim. She is terrified that this mistake will follow her everywhere, making a fresh start impossible.


I finally convinced her to start looking for jobs at other companies within the industry. To aim high and find a position that will truly make her happy. I forced her against her will to send out a few resumes and apply to some positions she thought she wasn't qualified for. Lo and behold, a recruiter from that company reached out to her mere hours later and wanted to schedule a phone interview with her the next day.


Well with these developments she brightened the fuck up almost instantly. All smiles as she finally realized that she actually has a bright future ahead of her. Next day Liz crushes the phone interview with the recruiter and an hour later receives an email that the Production Manager (a well known, highly respected hot shot in the industry) wants to interview her himself! 


She had the interview yesterday and when I got home she was in a weird daze. Liz says the interview was going great till about 10 minutes in, he started asking her about her accident, which completely caught her off guard. He didn't dwell on it and seemed to be very satisfied with her explanation because at the interview he ended offering her the job! He asked her to take a few days to think about it. Liz is stunned that he knew about the accident. They didn't ask for any references so she was perplexed how he could have found out.

Jump to this evening. Chad, Liz and I are out having dinner and about halfway through the meal Chad asks if the Production Manager ended up offering her the job. Both Liz and I are confused cause we had been keeping her job search on the down low. He follows up that he knew the Production Manager from college and when he saw that Liz worked for the same company that Chad used to, he gave him a call 2 days ago before the interview to see if Chad knew her. Chad reveals he spoke of her accident and the circumstances behind it but that she was excellent at her job and that the Production Manager would be a fool not to hire her.


Liz was stunned and I could tell on the verge of tears, she excused herself to the bathroom. After 20 minutes she had not returned so I call her a couple times and get no response. Liz then texts me that she went out the back and got an Uber home, That she felt betrayed and never wanted to see Chad ever again.


I get home and we talk. Liz informs me that she emailed the Production Manager declining the job offer. I'm shocked, he knew about her accident but still offered her the job, I cant understand how she would think that is a bad thing. Liz believes that what the Production Manager did was unprofessional, unethical, and potentially illegal.  She thinks the accident will follow her for the rest of her career and that she needs to find a new industry to work in. She is furious that Chad would tell him about the accident and not immediately inform her. I tell her that I disagree and she flips out.


In my opinion Chad had a professional obligation to tell the truth and that he did no wrong. If he had lied or omitted that he knew about the accident and the Production Manager found out about the accident in the future, that it would reflect very very poorly on Chad. Liz can't believe I would defend Chad like this and makes some comments about my caring more about my friends professional reputation than her. She has now locked herself in the bedroom crying.


This is a mess, I have no idea what to do. I can understand Liz's mental block and the shame she feels about the accident, but besides urging her to get help and talk to a therapist, I don't know what else I can do help her get over it. Especially now that I am currently a Bad Guy.


Apologies for the rushed sentences and horrid grammar, it's been a crazy night and I'm having a hard time thinking straight.

TLDR : Me, My Girlfriend, and my Best Friend all work closely in the same Industry. Girlfriend had a very big accident at work that haunts her to this day. Girlfriend found new dream job but is horrified that new boss knew about her accident. Turns out Best Friend is buddys with new boss and told him about accident. Very upset and emotional Girlfriend


**edit: Holy smokes guys thanks for all the great ideas/advice. I'll will try to answer as many of your questions as I can **


**edit #2: just to clarify a few things 1) Chad had only been gone a month or two when the accident happened. He still has very strong ties to the people at our company and due to things like snap chat actually knew the full details of the accident before I did. 2) I seriously doubt that Chad understands how much Liz is haunted by the accident, she publicly jokes about it in social settings and conceals how much it continues to bother her. 3) I know for a fact that several of the Production Manager's current employees knew about the accident, it would have only been a matter of time before he found out regardless of Chad's endorsement. **

**edit #3: 600 comments and you've truly split fault 50/50. At this point I DON'T CARE WHO IS AT FAULT!!! I'm only interested in Advice that will A) make me a better boyfriend B) help me help my girlfriend find her happiness.**"
"Me [38F] with my Husband [39M] keeps getting drunk and did something terrible so I left him. He's begging for me to come back, I love him but don't know what to do


We have been together for 19 years married for 16 and have three kids. I'm a stay at home mom and he has his own business. My dad was a verbally abusive alcoholic. 

Husband is the nicest person ever sober, all his employees and family members love him, but when he drinks he is what you call a mean drunk. He calls me names sometimes, gets mad at random people, is unpleasant to be around and I hate sleeping next to him when he drinks because he acts like such an asshole. He doesn't do it everyday but it's enough where I've gotten sick and tired of it. 

So here's what happened, he got a new car and hit a guy on a motorcycle, he just hit the bike and did no harm to the guy but he drove off anyway. I picked him up and he started cursing the guy saying he's an asshole and it was his fault and he hopes he fucked uo his bike. He also went to go gamble.

I couldn't believe my ears. Keep in mind he was so drunk he didn't even know if he killed the guy. He has gotten a lawyer and the police don't know he was driving drunk. The police came to our house but he left before they came. This happened at midnight and the only reason the police knew was because the distinctive car and that he went to go gamble at a nearby casino.

The guy isn't pressing charges but this did it for me. He didn't even know if he killed the guy and this could of been so much fucking worse and he acts like it's no big deal. This man is the most generous, thoughtful guy before this.

I left the house and I'm with my mom. I told him I'm done with him. He has called me crying and begging for me to come back and telling me he'll change. That I mean the world to him and he couldn't stand living without me. It's so hard because I do love him but he was fucking driving drunk and didn't care if he hurt the person which is completely not him. I don't know if he's depressed or if there's something wrong with him. I am so hurt right now, I actually feel like my heart hurts and I don't know what to do. 
  
It was the scariest moment of my life. We didn't even know if he fucking killed the guy. When sober he doesn't have a mean bone in his body to anybody. He is not acting like the man I married. All I was thinking about is if he killed the guy and the guy had a family and he just ruined their lives. Yet he was acting like he didn't care and I could believe it.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband keeps getting drunk and becomes mean. He just committed a hit and run against a guy and didn't care if he hurt him or his motorcycle. He is acting like its no big deal and I have left him. He's begging for me back, he is the love of my life when he's sober but I am so fucking hurt and scared."
"Me [25M] with autism. My sister [26F] doesn't want to see me. I'm thinking of skipping my cousin's wedding [24F] so that she can go. My girlfriend [25F] is upset.

"I (22 F) hired a friend (19 M) to pet and house sit while I was with family for 2 weeks, and the third to last day I viewed his snapchat story to find him filming while driving MY CAR with one hand simultaneously holding huge glass of wine, while being given directions from a girl I don't know..


[removed]"
"I (23f) really screwed up and broke up with my boyfriend (28m) on the encouragement of my sister (29f) because she didn't think he had a good enough job for me. Now she is trying to hook him up with her best friend (30f) And I don't know what to do, at all.


So if it isn't obvious from the title, I really really screwed up. Basically I was dating the greatest guy ever and was really in love with him and thought he was the best thing ever happened to me. The problem is, is that he's the manager at an oil  change place and that's really all he ever wants to do with his life. I was happy with it, he's very happy with it because he's very good at his job and he also has a group of employees and even customers that love him and he has probably the best performing shop in the state. My sister on the other hand always told me that I am swinging below my ability basically and that I should try to go for another Guy with a better job and more potential.

So I was very stupid and I listen to her and in June I broke up with my boyfriend it was devastating to me and I know it was devastating to him and I have tried several times to get him back but he says I heard him too much and it was a window into my soul that he didn't like looking through even though he loves me with all his heart.

 I am pretty much resolved myself that it's going to take me a long, long, long time to get over this and have pretty much excepted that I screwed up and the only time is going to heal it. So here's the part that really sucks my sister, the one who encouraged me to break up with him, is now actively trying to set up her best friend with my ex-boyfriend. She tells me it's just a coincidence and she thinks that they would be great for each other.      So the obvious question is if her best friend is good enough for my ex-boyfriend why was and I get enough for him? Well she tells me that it's because she could never let her sister end up with the oil change man but she doesn't have the same issues with her friend. I'm so brokenhearted over this that I can hardly even sleep at night, in fact I can't sleep at night because I feel so betrayed and I feel like such an idiot that I listen to her When it certainly seems she had this grand plan all along.

 I'm so brokenhearted it, I am so lost I'm so devastated I don't even know what to do. And now add this B trail in from my sister and I don't even feel like I can face the day most days. How do I handle my sister? How do I handle my ex-boyfriend, I mean is it his life and I should stay out of his business even though I know there was some weird shit going on with my sister and the girl who's trying to date him now? 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I screwed up really huge and broke up with my boyfriend on the encouragement of my sister. Now my sister is trying to hook her best friend up with my ex-boyfriend and I have a run of emotions, none of them good, and don't know what to do."
