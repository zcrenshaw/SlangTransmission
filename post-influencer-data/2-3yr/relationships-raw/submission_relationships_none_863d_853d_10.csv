  [Original](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cj0be/me_30f_with_my_partner_33_f_of_over_a_year_we/)

I checked in with her about wanting to make sure we had time that wasn't just right before bed and right after waking up, as well as maintaining sweet/silly communication throughout the day.

She agreed that was important, that she wanted it too, and thanked me for suggesting it. We are now planning one date event a week (going for a walk, watching a movie, having a glass of wine, cooking together, etc), and sending more fun, less logistics-related messages throughout the day.

Definitely communicate! Thank you everyone for your help.

"How do I [26F] tell my husband [31M] I'm addicted to drugs?


Backstory: My husband and I have been married for (almost) five years. He's amazing, I know everyone says that but he really is an incredible person. He's a great husband, treats me well, he's supportive and loving and just everything I need him to be. I think I'm a pretty good wife to him as well, with the exception of this one thing. 

I'm absolutely terrified to tell my husband I'm addicted to amphetamines. I need help and he deserves to know what his wife is doing but I can't bring myself to say the words. I don't want to be a source of stress or anxiety for him. I'm worried about how this could change his opinion of me or our relationship. I'm obviously ashamed of myself too. I think the idea of facing reality and giving up the drugs is part of it as well.

I'm unable to control this anymore. I bought meth for the second time this month despite swearing to myself I wouldn't do it again. I take dangerously high doses of Adderall and Dexedrine. I've lost weight- my BMI was on the lower end of normal to begin with and I'm borderline underweight now. My eyes look sad. I'm sleepy whenever I'm not high. I feel absolutely horrible about myself and I'm really scared.  

I love him so much. I feel like a liar for keeping this from him. At the same time I'm worried about what it will do to him. He knows *something's* up. He's a Firefighter-Paramedic and interacts with people on drugs often so I wouldn't be surprised if it's crossed his mind. I'm fairly good about hiding it though, I limit my use to nights he's at work. We still spend time together. Our sex life is fine. He's pretty busy because he helps with his father's business in addition to working (he really is amazing). It's possible he has no idea and I'm about to drop this on him out of nowhere. 

If anyone has been in this position or has advice I'd like to hear it (and appreciate you sharing). I honestly don't know what to say or how to begin the conversation. He's home today and I want to get it over with. I want to cry every time I look at him.

Edit: This is complicated by the fact that my only real friend where we live uses these drugs. My relationship with her has to end and I'm a little sad about it. She's more involved than I am and doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. There's no option but to go our separate ways. I'm probably looking for excuses to avoid talking to him too.

**Update**: Thank you for the encouraging and kind responses. I told him. 

He didn't know. He knew something was wrong but thought it had to do with depression. My cousin and best friend committed suicide last year; her birthday was in April and next month is the anniversary of her death. It makes sense he attributed anything different to something like depression. He was concerned about an eating disorder too. Also, I encapsulated the meth and took it orally. It was like a strong Adderall. I wasn't behaving like a stereotypical tweaker (like the people you see on TV). I'm only adding this to clarify the situation, not to minimize it. It's still meth. But I understand why he didn't suspect it. I'm also the last person anyone would suspect of doing drugs, especially meth. I used to teach kindergarten to give you some perspective. Other than experimenting in my late teens and my current situation I've never really used drugs or alcohol. 

I'm so grateful for this man. He might be an actual Saint. When I told him he just put his arms around me and said ""I love you. Everything's going to be okay."" I just cried and cried. Then *he* started crying and I honestly wanted to die. He was very concerned about my health. He asked a few questions about headaches and my vision and wanted to check my blood pressure. He made me give him the drugs. He had a *really* hard time believing I was doing meth until he saw it. Then we talked some more and that's when he told me he was concerned about my mental health but never suspected drugs. He definitely had questions and I answered everything honestly. I made sure to take responsibility and chose my words carefully. This is the result of my bad decisions and nothing else. It's been a rough and emotional night but I feel better after telling him. 

It was easier than I thought. I wish I hadn't waited so long to tell him. I feel so much better about quitting now, like stronger in a way, and it's such a relief to have this off my chest. It's like I can finally move forward. We talked a little bit about how to handle things but didn't make any solid plans yet. I'm contacting my old therapist tomorrow to make an appointment. I'm considering something like NA but I'm not religious so we'll see. I'm open to suggestions if anyone has them. 

**Update 2**: I just want to say thank you again for the supportive comments and messages. I appreciate all of you taking the time to reply or write to me. I've read everything but I'm tired and anxious and haven't been able to respond to everyone (sorry about that). My husband is at work now and I'm waiting for 9:00 to call the therapist's office. I'm reading up on NA in the meantime.

Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69k897/me_26_f_with_a_friend_28_f_of_2_years_she_wants/

So Jessica messaged me the other day flipping out. She was mad, because she had found out that 2 acquaintances that graduated before us are having a small Wedding Shower with just close friends and immediate family on Campus. She found out because another friend asked to stay with her that weekend, both to see Jessica and to go to the shower. Jessica isn't invited to the shower, because she isn't that close to the couple. She saw it as a great personal insult and ranted and raved at me about how much she hates all of them and has now cut off both the couple and the other friend.

 Then things got nasty. I tried to get her to calm down and she starts talking about how she is doing to crash the party and make sure they are miserable and how she hopes they divorce or if they try to have kids that all they get are miscarriages. Really hateful things.

 Then she starts going on about how everyone is treating her like the bad guy for doing these things, when really ""they are making [her] do them."" I told her off in a major way and told her I was going to contact the couple to warn them. She then told me ""That I of all people should understand her pain, because of how Tim treated me (who she still talks to) and Go F*** myself"" and unfriended and blocked me. 

I have contacted the couple and warned them and they are taking precautions. Not sure what to do next. Kinda glad the toxicity is gone. I am also really thankful for the advice you all gave me. 


TL:DR- Hypocritical ""friend"" showed her mean and spiteful side and unfriended me. "
"I [25M] fell in love with my best friend [24F] she has a disability and I want to assure her, and her parents I'm in it for the long run. How should I go about this?


Throw away because she redits

I met Mia at college when we were both 18 years old, I was an extremely sheltered, shy kid from a tiny town and I was sitting at a table in the cafeteria of a huge college in a major city. I was looking down at my tray, thinking I made the worst decision ever when someone rolled up next to me. It was Mia, and she was in a wheelchair. Honestly I saw her before the chair, she's freaking gorgeous, and honestly you notice her nose ring and long curly hair before you notice the chair. She had me laughing so hard, milk sprayed out of my nose. 

From that day forward we were inseparable, and we spent tons of time together. Forward almost seven years and we've been friends through some crazy times, us graduating, my step mom (basically my mom) going through breast cancer (she's in remission), graduate school, and two surgeries for her. I pretty much knew I was in love with Mia a few years ago, I even admitted it once three years ag (after getting drunk) and she shot me down. 

She admitted she had feelings for me but she said that dating her was a commitment she didn't want me to undertake. She has a form of muscular dystrophy, she says fortunately she has the kind that is slow acting and won't shorten her lifespan too shortly. However there is a lot that goes into her care, most of which she does on her own or has an aide for.  Most likely she cannot have children and she knows that I love kids and want to have some someday. So she's was adamant about us not dating.

Her friendship means more to me than being in a relationship, so I stayed friends with her and just enjoyed that. I dated off and on nothing serious as I worked full time and I attended school. Until a few months ago, Mia came to me in tears, she admitted she loved me too and if she never acted on it she'd regret it. Seriously these last few months have been the best months of my life.

So last night I was over Mia's parents house with her and we were in her bedroom watching tv . I went to use the bathroom and overheard her mom telling her dad that while they love me they worry about Mia getting hurt. They worry I'm not in in for the long run and I don't understand or know what a future with her entails. Honestly you guys I'm so in love with this girl, there's no doubt in my mind she's the one. I'm under no illusion our lives may not be always easy but I don't care. As for kids, adoption is always an option, and honestly yes I love kids but I love her more. 

I just want to know how I can tell this to her and her parents. Let them know that I've done research on her condition, I'm in the medical field. I've even talked to a support group that deals with people with MD and their families. I'm here for whatever. I just don't know how I can say this?

Edit: I sat down with her folks this afternoon when Mia was getting a shower by her Aide. I showed them this Reddit and both of them got very emotional. They said that they are very happy I'm in her life. That If this is truly what I want and I'm aware our life won't be easy that they give their blessing. I then showed Mia this as well. She cried and gave me a big hug. She knows now I'm serous and I'm in this for the long run. Thank you guys so much for your kind words, and upvotes. I apologize for any grammar mistakes or misspelled words. English isn't my first or my second language, I'm learning but occasionally I screw up :) 

TL;DR: I'm head over heels for my Best friend of seven years who I've been dating for a few months. How can I tell her and her family her disabilities don't scare me?"

**[Update] I told her and she took it very well! She said that it's not a big deal to her. Even though she does want kids one day she said she's fine with adoption or visiting a sperm bank.**

**She had some questions about testosterone levels, performance those kind of things. I explained that it's not a problem for me and everything is fine in that department.**

**Then she asked me something I never prepared for. She said ""So, do you have an implant down there?"". For those who don't know, you can get pseudo testicles if you lose one/both. They put them in, tie them in place and Bob's your uncle, similar to breast implants after a mastectomy. I always knew it was an option but I have never really cared about levelling my lopsided equipment. Thankfully this was just a curios question and not a deal breaking one. I told her I don't and she said ""It's okay, just don't be surprised if I start making jokes about it"" I told her that's fine because I do the same thing, we shared a laugh and that was that, life went on as normal.**

**Thank you everyone who commented with advice and sharing your similar experiences, they were all very helpful! You collectively gave me the ball to tell her, and I thank you all :)**

Edit: Throwaway because my friends and family know my main account

Edit 2: Thank you very much for your helpful comments, I only replied to a few but I read all of them. I have decided to tell her tomorrow morning as it's 11pm here in the U.K, she's asleep and I'm quite tired myself. Again, thank you for the comments they were very helpful.

I lost a testicle when I was 12 to testicular torsion (I'll leave you to Google it. Just don't look at the images) the doctors didn't get to it in time so it died and needed to be removed. Other than the pain, I didn't really care. I wasn't happy it was gone, but I wasn't sad either. I had more of a ""Shit happens"" approach to it. And life went on as normal.

Fast forward a few years to 19 year old me and I get a call from my doctor, it turns out that when this happens they usually do a sperm count after the healing process but because I hadn't started puberty it got postponed. The results came back and it looks like the fella is even lonelier than I first thought, he has no swimmers either, I am his only friend. 

Lucy (Not her real name) is a very sweet, kind, gentle hearted girl. She's always cheerful even on her bad days, has an amazing and sometimes dark sense of humour and I love spending time with her. We just click, as soon as we meet we're laughing and having a great time within seconds. I'm really committed to her and I'm afraid that she may want kids one day and I won't be able to provide that for her, it's tearing me apart. 

Btw I call him the lone wanderer. 

**TL;DR**

 lost a testicle when I was 12 due to testicular torsion, doctors waited until late puberty for a sperm count, turns out I have billy no mates between my legs. Not sure how to tell the girl I'm dating."

"[UPDATE] Me [24f] with my i-don't-even-know [24m] of 4 months, spending a week in a remote cabin, help??


original post is here: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/687bms/me_24f_with_my_idontevenknow_24m_of_4_months/

this is really late on account of how impossible it is to get wifi but oh my god. thank you all so much. I wasn't expecting the outpouring of ass-kicking and goodwill that you guys delivered. and it WORKED.  I'm a little emotional. ;_;

basically i followed your advice, put on my big girl pants, and had the best vacation of my life. the cabin was AMAZING. I never thought it would go that well. chopping wood, baking bread, home cooked stew every night, hot cocoa, wool sweaters, fires, long walks in the woods, the whole ~cozy domestic~ nine yards. we could see our breath indoors the whole week, so getting out of bed was a challenge. 

speaking of bed: now that we didn't have the logistics problems that we had at work, things were...considerably better. to put it mildly. if you want a spicy detail, let's just say that tying knots is normally my job.

Basically we went on a honeymoon. I know people who have done exactly what we did for their actual honeymoons. I didn't have The DTR Conversation at the end of the week but...I don't care? The next time I can feasibly see him is in six months, so we're staying in contact and I'm not going to ask anything more of him. 

I guess that vacation was comparable to taking mushrooms--awesome, but it feels like almost cheapening the experience to immediately crave another dose. Sure, I'll be torn up if we never see each other again, but I'm just glad we were able to share that time together.

I struggle with mental health issues, namely alcoholism and pretty serious anxiety/depression and my mother has become convinced by him that I have a demon which may lead me to commit some violent crime. She showed me the Facebook conversation they had on the topic and he was saying that while I'm not dangerous the demon could lead me to do bad things.

She would like me to take part in an exorcism (I cannot believe I am even typing this). It would only cost 400$ (quite the bargain) and while I do really want to meet this person to get some kind of insight into this weird fucking situation I'm not sure if getting involved with him in any capacity is a good idea. I'm also offended and worried that he's telling my mother that I might commit some terrible act one day and she's believing him.

"I [22F] am sick of my boyfriend [24M] (2 years) always talking about a female video game character.


I'm new to this subreddit, made a throwaway because my boyfriend is on reddit. I apologize if this is really long, I just need to vent. Also, I can't figure out how to flair.

So I've been dating this guy for two years. Last year, this video game came out, and he has been obsessed with this one female character. (Y'all can probably guess which game.) He has her as his computer wallpaper, phone wallpaper, ringtone, he has shirts with her logo on it, fan art, a decal on his car, and he wants figurines of her. 

He literally mentions her at LEAST once a day, and when I get annoyed, he finds it amusing. He doesn't get how insecure it makes me. And when I call him out on it, he gets all defensive, and he tells me that he loves me, and that it's just a character in a game, so it's not like she could actually steal him away from me. Which to me, sounds like if she were real, or if he happened to stumble upon a girl that was very similar to her in looks and personality, he would totally leave me for her. 

And he'll do annoying shit like when we're having a nice cuddle, he'll trace her whisker marks on my cheeks, and then act like he doesn't know why I'm upset.

He was the one who recently introduced me to reddit, and even showed me how to add friends and see their posts and comments.Today, he wanted to show me a comment he made on some post (it was about things you secretly find cute about your SO, and he found a way to mention her in there), so while I was on my lunch break, I decided to scroll through his post history to see what else he posts about. 90% of his comments, and his last few posts, are about this video game character, some of which were saucy fan art.

He always gets upset when I bring up the fact that he talks about her, and says he feels like I'm saying I want to break up. Well, sometimes I wonder if I should, because I really fucking hate feeling this way. And I feel like I've had this conversation with him at least once a month.

How do I deal with the fact that my boyfriend is overly obsessed with this video game character? I used to have obsessions with fictional characters, but once he and I started dating, all those feelings pretty much stopped, and it annoys me that his feelings haven't. 

Or should I just break up with him? I love him, and I want to marry him someday, but I don't want to feel like I'm competing with video game characters for the rest of my life.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend is obsessed with a video game character, constantly talks about her (to me and on reddit) and has/wants tons of her merchandise, and finds it amusing when I get jealous. When I get too upset, he gets butthurt for a while, stops for a day, and then the cycle starts again. How do I get him to stop? Or do I just learn to deal with it? Or should I just leave him?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone! I was starting to doubt myself, thinking maybe I was overreacting, but it seems most of you don't think I'm overreacting. I talked to my boyfriend, this time making it clear that what he's doing really hurts me and is disrespectful. If he does it again, I'm just going to link him to this post and tell him it's over. I hope it doesn't come to that though.

**UPDATE: I don't know which of you fuckers managed to find my boyfriend and send him a link to this post. But thanks. He's finally realized how serious I was about the whole thing. He actually left work early and drove two hours to talk to me about it in person. We're on the same page now.**

We've been dating for 9+ years. We've lived together for 6. As with any long term relationship, there have been ups and downs. 

After about the 6 year mark, people started wondering when we'd get engaged. I think she started wondering this. I felt that I wasn't ready. Something wasn't right. 

Somehow, at some point, I completely fell out of love. She's my best friend, but I have no romantic feelings whatsoever. I've tried to find ways to get these feelings back, but they're just not there. 2 years ago,we moved back to the city where we first met. There were a number of reasons for this, but I also hoped that this would help us/me find those feelings again. It did not help. 

Last night, she knew something was wrong. It took awhile, but eventually I broke down and explained that I no longer have feelings, and I didn't think we could move forward. She started bargaining and trying to remind me of the good parts of our relationship. She wants to fight to keep us together. I don't. I remember the good times fondly, but I feel like I'm not the same person I was back then. I know there is no way to do this without hurting her, but I'm trying to help her understand why I'm doing this. 

I wrote a letter because I feel like is one of the only ways I can explain this without one or both of us breaking down. I've anonymized some parts for obvious reasons. I haven't shown this to her yet, but do you all think this is a good idea? I think she thinks I'm just depressed and wants to help me through it. I so appreciate that about her, but I need her to know that I am not in this any more. 

------------- The letter -----------

**EDIT:** Due to some disturbing private messages, I've removed the contents of the letter. In it, I described my internal struggle and tried to explain why I had reached the conclusion that I did. I realize from some of the comments here that it was probably more harmful than anything.

"I (31m) think my fiance's (33f) new work environment is toxic for our relationship


So long story short we've been together 3 years, living together a little over 2 years, and engaged for about 9 months. We have a great relationship, never fight or argue, and get along great. 

Except for the last 3-4 months.... My fiance got a new job where she works in an office with 3 other women, all of whom appear to completely hate their husbands. These women do nothing but bitch, bitch, bitch about anything their men do. At first she would come home and tell me these stories, and how crazy the ladies are.... But now she's best friends with the manager, who actually does seem to have a pretty terrible husband. Dude sounds like a dick. 

Fast forward to now, and the past few months. She's suddenly complaining about me and everything I do, to me, and sounds almost just like the girls at work. Who at first she said sounded ridiculous.. pointing out every little tiny mistake, or problem, or thing I forget. It's like suddenly I can't do anything right although I was so wonderful for the past two and a half years... I don't get it. 

Don't get me wrong I know relationships change, people get complacent and maybe get new habits.. and I'm not perfect. I know there's things I can be better on. But I do almost everything at home. I'm like the man of the house yet I also pay the bills and I'm a stay-at-home mom because I work from home.. I make breakfast every morning. I take the kid to school, I pay the bills, I take out the garbage, I clean the house, fix things, run ALL the errands, I do almost everything.. everything. Honestly I don't think most men would do as much as I do. Not to brag. 

Honestly I feel like the girls at work are rubbing off on her and she's​ starting to nitpick everything I do. 

How do I bring this up without causing an issue, or sounding like I'm arguing her points. Some are valid yes, but most are not.

Tl:dr girls at my fiance's work all hate their husbands, and their negativity seems to be rubbing off on her. She's slowly starting to nitpick everything I do. After having a wonderful 2 1/2 years prior with no issues.

"I [24F] went home to visit my mom [50s]. My formerly abusive father [50s] wouldn't let her spend alone time with me. I don't think I can keep visiting her if it means seeing him.


My mom has been cat sitting for me for a few days, and the original plan was for me to come pick my pets up late afternoon today. 

However, circumstances changed, and I ended up having an opportunity to come into town last night. As soon as I knew it was possible to come into town earlier than expected, I called my mother and asked if that would be okay. She enthusiastically said yes.  

My mother and father are married, but I don't have the best relationship with my father. He is a severe alcoholic, and when I was growing up he was abusive to me, my mother, my adopted sister, and even an ex-boyfriend of mine. My mother has forgiven him for a lot, but I haven't. He hasn't physically abused either of us or had a drink in about a year, but my relationship with him is strained at best. When I visit home, I go to see my mom. My dad and I are cordial, but don't spend any time together alone. 

Now, when I still lived at home my mother and I used to go to garage sales together on Saturdays. It was our own special time to spend together, but since I moved a few hours away around 5 years ago, we haven't had the opportunity to spend a lot of time together. Since it turned out I would be coming into town Friday night, I asked my mother if she'd like to go to a few garage sales together the next morning. She seemed excited and said that the weather forecast was calling for rain, but that she'd love to go if weather permitted. 

So, I drove into town after I got off work last night. I came with only the clothes on my back, since I had other weekend plans and was only planning on spending a few hours with my mom the next day before heading back home. When I woke up this morning at my parents house, my mom was already awake and dressed. I asked if she was ready to go to some garage sales.

My dad answered for her. He told her no, she wasn't going because she needed to help him with yard work. I tried to point out that my mom and I had made plans the night before, but my dad said the only way she could come with me was if I volunteered to help with yard work when we got back. 

Reddit, the only clothes I had with me were business casual work clothes. I was wearing a silk top, long black slacks, and ballet flats; not the kind of clothing one does yard work in. I tried to articulate this and say that if I had been asked in advance to help with yard work, I would have packed different clothes. My dad's only response was that he hadn't decided to do any yard work until he woke up that morning. 

My dad ended up yelling at my mom about having a lazy, selfish daughter and told my mom she wasn't allowed to go anywhere with me since I was ""refusing to help.""

So I left. I gathered my cats and drove 2 hours back to the town I live in now, without having spent any time at all with my mom. 

As I was leaving, she tried to apologize to me. She said she was sorry she wasn't able to do anything with me, but that she didn't have a choice. 

I left in tears, angry at both my parents. Angry at my dad for being controlling, and angry at my mom for letting him control her. 

I love my mom with all my heart, but I hate my father just as much. It's getting harder and harder to fake getting along with him when I go home to see her, and I don't know if I can do it anymore. I'm afraid now that any time I go home my dad can make up some reason to keep my mom from spending alone time with me. What can I do?

***TL;DR: I had an opportunity to spend some time with my mom this weekend, but my abusive dad wouldn't let her because I wasn't able to help them do last minute yard work. I don't think I can keep going home to see my mom if it means having to be around an abuser. What can I do?***"

"I (24M) recently met my father (55M) for the first time along with 4 ""new"" siblings (7-19). I'm struggling with resolving the fact that I like them with hatred for my father.


I have one other post in my account that briefly breaks down my growing up without a dad and my first time meeting him. Since that meeting, I cooled down and have started to slowly build a relationship with him, and now with my siblings.

I still have a ton of hate for him and resentment/jealousy for my siblings. I feel twisted up in my own emotions. With regard to my father, I see him as a coward and a piss ass excuse for a father for abandoning me. I also admire the man as a father to my siblings, a husband to his wife and an owner of his business. He's charismatic, funny, confident. In many ways, he's the type of man I always dreamed of becoming.

I have too much of a chip on my shoulder. I'm insecure. I'm angry all the time. I'm easily annoyed and people often tell me I look angry or annoyed or intense. The worst is when women who I think I've been flirting with tell me I look intimidating. And I can't turn it off. I don't even notice that I'm looking this way or giving off this energy.

At the same time as I find myself admiring my father for the qualities mentioned above, I hate him for it. My younger brothers have these qualities. And I feel cheated. What made them worthy of a father and me unworthy? Why was their mother worth standing by and mine was disposable? 

I feel further twisted because I have fallen in love with my siblings. On one hand, I'm jealous. I see the home they grew up in. I see the comaraderie they have between one another. I see that finances have not been a constant source of stress for them as it was for me. They didn't worry about their safety in the neighborhood they grew/are growing up in.

And I resent that. 

I feel like shit, though. Because when I flew out to meet them, I made that entire flight with hate in my heart. I was so full of rage I cried on that plane. I was so ready to hate them. So ready to tell them what a piece of cowardly shit their father was. But when I saw them look at me and they had nothing but love for me in their eyes.

My 19 year old sister cried and held onto me. She told me how happy she was that she had a big brother. She told me how badly she wanted to get to know me.

My 7 year old sister ran to me like she knew me her whole life and jumped into my arms. She was so proud of me. So proud to have me as a brother she kept shouting to her mom and dad to take pictures of us alone so she could show her friends.

My 12 and 17 year old brothers grinned at me from ear to ear. Asked me to play games with them and to show them ""judo moves"". And that last bit is what got me.

I only told my father I do judo. I didn't tell his wife. That means he's been talking about me to them. 

I feel, at the same time, pride, anger, and shame. I feel proud that I finally have a dad that brags on me and siblings that look up to me. I feel anger at the abandonment and like I want him to pay. I don't want it to simply be swept under the rug. And I feel shame for being so ready to hate people who were eager to love me.

Please help me to sort through these emotions.

Tl;dr- I recently met my father and 4 siblings. I feel like I'm contorted and I could use some help unpacking the feelings of anger, pride, and shame that have been brought on.

"Me [28/F] with my roommate [31 M]. He invades my personal space, hugs me, and is too needy.


Hi reddit! Throwaway because I don't know if my roommates use reddit. I've never posted before so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.

I moved in about six months ago, and my new roommates seemed awesome ([30 M], [31 M])! Let's call them Justin and Alex. Justin has a girlfriend and spends a loads of time away, and Alex is single. I'm in a serious relationship, and have been for 4 years.


Alex is very huggy and seems very unhappy with not having found anyone. He complains about everyone else having a partner. Recently he has taken up the habit of hugging me every time we see each other. I don't mind hugging but he does it repeatedly and seems to enjoy it too much. You know the kind of embrace you'd like to break but that just goes on for a few secons too long. He always hovers around me telling me how he loves having me home, and constantly engages me in conversation even if I'm busy or want a moment of peace and quiet.

Justin's cool. He gives me the personal space I need and when it's only me and him, we can go about our own business without problems. Alex, on the other hand, needs my active presence, and constantly wants to interact with me.

Here are some examples of his behaviour towards me:
We work in the same building and occationally have lunch together, also in the presence of mutual collegues. Usually when we get up to leave, he hangs back and kind of corners me. Once he breafly placed his hand on my lower back to kind of lead me through the doorway. On another occation, he even kissed me on the cheek as a reation to me sayiing how glad I was to have found such a cool appartment. Both times I got really unconfortable and didn't know what to say or do, especially because of our colleagues being there as well.

After these two situations, I did confront him once (in the presence of Justin) saying his hungs made me uncomfortable (putting most of the blame on my need of personal space). After this, he has stopped hugging me as much but I see it's a conscious battle every time. He still hovers around me as usual.
  

I don't think he has a crush on me, he seems more the desperate type (he comments on my girlfiends' and even my sisters' appearance and keeps asking me if they're single). I really like him as a person and would want to know how to go about the problem. I need my space but would not want to move out. How can I put an end to his behavior without upsetting him and losing a friend? Please help me reddit!
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My roommate keeps hugging and touching me without my consent which makes me uncomfortable. How can I make it stop without upsetting him? I like him as a person and would like to keep him as a friend."
