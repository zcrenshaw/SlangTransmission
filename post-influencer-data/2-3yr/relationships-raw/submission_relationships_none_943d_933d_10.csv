"I [32 M] gave my brother [38 M] a laptop for my nephew, but my brother is now using it as his work laptop


My nephew is turning ten and is really into minecraft.  He has played with the lego sets since he was little and even reads the books about minecraft adventures (I didn't know that was a thing!).  The only time my nephew was able to play was on my mother's tablet every once in a great while because my brother uses his laptop for work.  

I was presented with an opportunity to get a used laptop for $100.  It's not a gaming laptop by any means, but it will play minecraft just fine.  Before I bought it, I spoke with my brother and told him that I wanted to buy the laptop so that my nephew would have something to do homework on but also so he could play minecraft.  He agreed and so I bought the laptop.  I spent some time setting it up, installing minecraft and other stuff like antivirus so that it was safe for him.  I gave it to my brother last fall.  

Fast forward to just recently when I was watching my nephew for the evening.  He said he wanted to play minecraft on my computer so I agreed.  I asked him what he liked to do in minecraft, what types of things he liked to build, but he said he never got to play.  Confused, I asked why not.  He said that they didn't have a computer for him to play on.  At this point I was already pretty certain of what had happened, but I didn't want to throw my brother under the bus.  I asked if he could use his dad's laptop to play on.  He said, ""Well, his black one has it installed, but that's always at work.  His silver one is too old and slow.""  The black laptop, is the one that I gave my brother.  

I'm pissed.  I never would have spent $100 to buy my brother a laptop.  I just wanted to do something nice for my nephew. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I bought a laptop for my nephew to use but my brother kept it for himself instead.  

Am I wrong to be upset? I understand that he is the parent but I feel taken advantage of.  I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but would it be out of line for me to demand that he either give it to my nephew or give it back? 

Edit: Holy shit.  I responded to the first couple of people that responded and thought that was the end of this, so I went to bed.  I never expected this post to get so much attention.  I'll never be able to respond to everyone, but I'll try and respond to the highest comments.  I'll update later if/when I confront my brother. "
"I [29 M] am not able to forgive my parents [47F/55M]


I am a 29 year old male who was living in a 1st world country for over 5 years. I come from an Asian country where the culture revolves entirely around family. I had a really good job in 1 of the best cities of the world. But my parents always kept on emotionally blackmailing me to take up a lesser job in my home country because they couldn't imagine a life alone. My dad retired early like at 45, (mostly because his business was not good) and never took care of the family and I have been meeting the financial needs of the family for the last 8 years.

After years of resisting the emotional blackmail, I finally accepted a job in my home country and shifted back, though to a different city from my original city. My parents moved in with me in the new city within a week of my shifting back.

Culturally I am now supposed to take care of them, show them around, create a life for them and make them feel awesome. But the sacrifice has taken a toll on me. I didn't know anyone in the city before moving back and somehow the desire to socialize has died. I just go back home and don't even interact with my parents let alone showing them around.

There is a huge anger inside me that a 47/55 year old couple who can't create a social life of their own (not financially as I have been paying their bills and much more since a long time) wants to live a parasitic social life off their sons social life and that anger is preventing me from creating a social life of which they will be a part of.

How do I forgive them and accept the new reality?



  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Parents emotionally blackmailed me to move back to home country to live a parasitic social life off my social life. Anger preventing me from creating a social life for myself. Need advice to be able to forgive them and accept new reality.


Edit: Thanks everyone for the inputs and really appreciate all the support. I did think over it and its a huge decision. I do agree that my parents were selfish but its not 'entirely' there fault. The Indian culture is to blame as well. I am planning to sweat out the next few months and prepare to move back to my old job while continuing to financially support my parents from abroad."

"I [25M] am planning to go to Disneyworld with my girlfriend [20F], her mum wants us to take her little sister [8F].


Hey guys, what's up. So for March break, my GF and I are going to Disneyworld in Florida. Yayy. We haven't booked the hotels yet...should probably get on that. Anyways, my GF's mother wants her to bring along her younger sister because she has never been to Disneyworld (her mum will pay for hotel+flight+other stuff). Her sister also really wants to go. Don't get me wrong, I've met her sister before. She is a nice, sweet, well-behaved little girl. 

But IDK, I kind of wanted this trip just to be for us. And not to mention the added responsibility of taking care of an 8 year old. My GF, though, thinks its a great idea. I love her sister but I really just want the trip to be a romantic relaxing one. Am I being selfish for wanting this? How can I go about telling her this without sounding like an asshole?

TL;DR: GF's younger sister wants to go to Disneyworld with us. I kind of just want the trip to be between my GF and I...

**EDIT** Good news, y'all. I phoned my girl, told her about my misgivings, and she called her parents. In the end GF's mum and dad will be taking the little sister to Disneyworld in early May. We will be postponing our trip until then as well. Good compromise between spending time with her family and having alone time! **"

"Lost expensive bracelet - fallout ensues [UPDATE]


[Original Post] (Https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5usoa0/lost_expensive_bracelet_boyfriend_31_bought_me_26/)


I (25F) got a huge response from this original post, some people were pretty harsh on me (damn you, tidy people!) and others were very sympathetic. I had a lovely message from someone with a similar experience and it made me feel a whole lot better.


When my boyfriend (31M) got in he was great, gave me a big hug and told me we could replace it. I wasn't fussed about a replacement, it was the thought that counted and every time I remembered the bracelet weeks on I got upset....


Today, weeks after I initially lost the bracelet and caused WW3 by making our house resemble a bombsite, I messaged all the places I went again. The restaurant messaged back saying there was no bracelets that have been handed in but to offer a description and she'll keep an eye out. I gave a description and then she sent me a picture. A PICTURE OF MY BRACELET. 


Keeping in mind I'd already rang the restaurant I was in shock and I've been beaming ever since. My boyfriend is collecting the bracelet for me tomorrow as it's near where he works. 


Miracles do happen! Thank you to everyone who offered support, tough love and advice. I have been working on being a bit tidier around the house anyway. This community is literally amazing, you've helped me though some important things and trivial things (like this)! Thank you!!!!!!!!!


**TL;DR** Lost bracelet 3 weeks ago. Acted like crazy woman and caused argument with boyfriend. Been in mourning ever since. Miraculously bracelet found at restaurant 3 weeks later.

"Me (38M) wanting to ask my (42F) GF to marry me but I want to involve her son (16M) and I'm a bit nervous


I met my GF we will call her M on okcupid 8 years ago. I was aware she was a widow, in fact I knew of her. We live in a small town and her husband was a hero cop killed in the line of duty.
When she messaged me on Okcupid I was surprised because A) she's way out of my league(she's a doctor, drop dead gorgeous, and very smart) and b) I was surprised she'd use Ok cupid as I knew several eligible bachelors that had her in their sights.

Anyway we hit it off, we went on several dates and she explained she wanted to take things slow because she was still healing from her husbands death, and she had a son who himself was slowly coming to the terms his father was gone and she wanted to tread lightly.
We dated for nearly 6 months before I met Christopher. I never wanted children, I love them but it wasn't a need. But I immediately fell in love with him, it was obvious he was struggling with his dads death but he was and is a great young man.
Speed up to now, things are great between us. All three of us, I moved in three years ago and it was a bit of a growing period but we got through it. I wanted to wait until she brought up marriage and in the last year she has, as well as trying for one last baby. I'm totally on board for both. I love this woman and cant wait to spend my life with her. Herein lies my reason for asking strangers on reddit. I want to involve Chris somehow, he is totally cool with us getting married. I just don't know how to go about asking him, trying to come up with a good idea. Also I'm nervous about proposing. I've heard stories (when we are hanging with her family or friends and they reminisce about her late husband) about the epic way he proposed and how touched she was. I just want to make it special for her but different than her late husband. If I'm making any sense. I bought the ring and picked it up today , I just needed some advice from reddit.

Been together for 5 and a half years and we were long distance.. I moved in with him about a year and a half ago, and in the beginning it was perfect. 

Long distance was always amazing.. We texted all the time, phone calls, all that all the time. It was perfect to me and I loved it.. But I was eager to move in with him, and he said the same. 

We talked about it for all of those years, wishing we lived together.. Saying we wanna spend all day together.. Ect ect.

Now we have this.. It's what we talked and dreamed about.

I noticed he hasn't been the same though, he spends a lot of time doing stuff by himself and usually our only time together is at night, when we get in bed and cuddle and watch a movie. 

We are still very obviously in love and I kinda just thought it was different because the honey moon phase is over, which makes sense. But I guess it's more than that. 

Finally I asked about it.. He was kinda emotional about it and he told me ""I'm sorry.. You're just.. Not as exciting as you were when we were long distance. It was fun all the time.. Visiting you was fun. I thought living together would be the same, but it's not."" 

He went on to say my personality is different in person and I'm not as fun and carefree, and I'm more serious and nervous and anxious all the time. Which I guess is true.. I worry a lot especially about what he thinks, and it does make me lame. 

I try to be fun, and I dress how he likes..i do my hair how he likes.. I clean the entire house, I take care of him and things that he needs. I thought he'd be happy having me live with him :(

I'm not sure what to do.. How do I act like I did when we were long distance? He said he's still in love with me and wants to marry me, but that living together just wasn't what he pictured. And he apologized a lot :(

Tl;dr; fiance says I'm not as fun as I was when we were long distance. I'm too serious and anxious. He doesn't seem to like me as much as he did in the beginning of livinf together. What the heck do I do??"

  **tl;dr**: I love my husband dearly but find myself competing with the memory of a manic pixie dream girl of his. What can I do to change the situation or change my mindset?

---

I met my husband three years ago on match.com. I'm a quiet and caring person that naturally blends into the crowd and have never been noticed much by boys all my life. Did the whole online dating thing for almost a year before finally meeting John, whom I married two years later. To me, John is the most wonderful and special person I've ever had the pleasure to meet. We love each other dearly and tell each other so every day. 

When our relationship became serious after a few months of dating, John read me a story he wrote about a previous love of his (Taylor), because it is an important part of him that he wanted to share with me. They met about 5 years ago during a once in a lifetime volunteering experience and spent the most amazing summer together in a beautiful place.

The story is about the special moments they shared together, things Taylor did for him on his birthday, group adventures they attended together where John only had eyes for Taylor, the nights they stayed up all night by the bonfire talking about life, and a lot more. This happened five years ago although the story was wrote shortly before John and I met online. I should mention that Taylor and John had an amicable breakup and kept in touch, but John stopped replying to Taylor after we got married.

The thing is, John and I never had many such special moments together. We used to and still do go on date in nice restaurants, frequent the west end, occasionally escape into the countryside over the weekends, but it was never something wild and magical. On our birthdays we buy each other nice gifts and spend quality time with the parents, but we don't disappear into the woods for a whole day and shout each other's names from top of a mountain.

I don't have a single thing to complain about our life together and John tells me everyday how happy he is with me. And this is what confuses me so much: I find myself comparing the way John treats me, to the way he used to treat his old love. Just a few examples: John can never remember what I got him on his birthdays and other holidays but can write down in great detail about the one birthday he got to spend with Taylor (she did ten cute things for him/with him). He wrote about the Taylor's look on the day he last saw her in great detail but can't remember what I wore the morning after our wedding. I occasionally get too excited to sleep, he says to need to get up early the next morning and just kisses me goodnight and goes to sleep himself, which only reminds me of him working 12 hour days while doing all he can to stay awake so that he could talk to Taylor all night. I know this all sounds immature and petty but I just can't help but feel...a little less special. I've never been the most special person in a group but I had hoped I'd be the most special woman for my husband.

I have talked to John about this, but he says it was all in the past and he is too content with his life with me to even think about Taylor now, although I find it hard to believe, given the 10k+ words story he read me about Taylor. I want to be the woman he writes about and tells his kids about when he gets old, but I have a feeling this is not going to happen. I also feel a bit guilty when these incidences come up, because I fear that they are the proof that Taylor is John's true love but he is subconsciously suppressing his feelings. I don't want to get go of him because he is the most special person for me, but I may not be special enough for him.

"Me [30F] with my best friend [31F] of 10 years told me I can't bring my SO to theme park.


This seems petty, but I’m not really sure how to respond. I’ll try to keep it short but give context. 


Backstory: I’ve been friends with Liz for nearly 10 years. She was my closest friend since we met in college and when we graduated, we lived 2 hours apart from one another. About 4 years ago, she moved to another state with her SO, Chuck [34M]. She visited her family a few times a year since she moved, and I would drive the 2 hours to see her. Even when she was away, we’d talk or text daily. 


Since she’s moved away, as her life has progressed, so has mine. I’m very happy for both of us. I met my SO, Marshall, and have been with him for 2 years. We currently live together. I have a really great group of friends here, and we all hang out as a group with our SOs and even with our single friends. Marshall and I do plenty of things together, but we also have a lot of time with our friends separately. 


Current Situation: Liz and Chuck got married almost a year ago. Chuck got a job in my city, so he and Liz moved about 30 minutes away from me and Marshall. We were very excited. I have gone out to dinner, shopping, spent time with Liz without Marshall or Chuck. Although I care for Liz a lot, when she moved, I think she expected things to go back to how they were before. 


Marshall and I decided to purchase year passes to a theme park, and they are quite expensive, but Marshall is paying for mine. This is something we enjoying doing together and with our friends.  I suggested that Liz and Chuck get some, too, and we can all go together. She then told me: “Chuck hates theme parks. So if I get one, Marshall will have to stay home when we go. Is he going to be okay with staying home?” 


This bothers me, not because I have to bring Marshall everywhere with me, but because she felt the need to tell me what I need to do or that she felt the need to say it at all. Marshall and I are very welcoming to our other friends and their SOs. We want everyone to feel welcomed. As adults, we feel like this is normal to spend time with our SOs as a group. What do I even say to address this? Or am I wrong for being annoyed?

"(UPDATE) Me [28 M] and girl I briefly dated [27/F]. Says she is pregnant.


Link to original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5atvin/me_28_m_and_girl_i_briefly_dated_27f_she_says_she/)

So almost four months ago I posted about how this girl I briefly dated texted me saying she's pregnant.  I didn't use protection which was really stupid and irresponsible.  She refused to send photos of the ultrasound that she supposedly received the day she texted me, and wouldn't meet up or talk on the phone.  I haven't heard from her since that day she broke the ""news"" in October.

Anyway, we're still friends on FB and I've noticed she has a new boyfriend (for about two months now).  She doesn't appear to have gained any weight that I can see, hasn't posted any statuses related to being pregnant, and also I saw a couple days ago she was in a bar with the new boyfriend and they were both holding bottles of beer.

So I'm pretty sure the whole thing was B.S. ?  If so, I don't know what the motivation was ?  I know she didn't want to keep on dating and we didn't have any crazy argument or bad blood.  

I've taken a screenshot of that photo of her with the beer and some other stuff, just in case, but yeah..thoughts?

"My [21F] boyfriend [22M] of one year is reacting weirdly about my sister [20F] breaking up with her boyfriend of six months [20sM]


My boyfriend, Aaron, and I have been together for about a year. My sister, Katie, had been dating Brian for about the last six months. It was one of those relationships where Brian was great about 3/4 of the time, but the other 1/4 was bad enough that the other 3/4 wasn't worth it. A few months ago, I told Aaron I was hoping Katie would break up with Brian, because the relationship was so unhealthy and I could see how stressed Katie was. He told me that was a terrible thing to say, and that I should be more optimistic. I figured we would just see what happened.

Katie ended up breaking up with Brian like I figured she should, because she was sick and tired of always having to go behind his back and think two steps ahead of him to strategize and avoid him getting upset over nothing. For instance, he was extremely paranoid, and was convinced that some of Katie's friends hated him. They do hate him now, but only because of how rudely he treated them. He would get upset when Katie would want to visit these friends, so she would have to either argue him down to shut him up or go behind his back. It was really unhealthy.

I do need to say to be fair that I understand why Brian acted the way he did. His parents were horribly unreliable growing up, and he had a very unstable life. But in the end, he would make all these promises to change, then go back to his old ways within a week. Katie gave him plenty of chances.

The reason why I'm posting is that I'm worried about Aaron's reaction to Katie dumping Brian. He keeps bringing up Brian's background, and saying that we don't know if his behavior was malicious or if he was just that messed up from his bad childhood that he didn't know any other way to behave. When Katie told Brian that he should get counseling, Aaron said that was cruel thing to say, but I think that was a real suggestion. 

What is also weird was that his sister once dated a really controlling guy, and he encouraged her to break up with him. He said that was different, because that guy was ""just a dick"" but Brian had some real issues. He's been saying how relationships take work, and it's not right to leave someone for things that aren't their fault. 

I'm hoping this will blow over after it's been awhile since the breakup, but I'm worried about why he seems to feel the need to defend this guy, who he barely knows. I've asked if there is anything else he is worried about, but he insists he just thinks Brian was treated unfairly.

I'm worried about why he seems to think behaving badly is okay as long as you have a good enough excuse for it. Do I have a good reason to be worried? Is this a red flag?

"My [22M] girlfriend's [21F] dad [55M] is dying slowly and very painfully. I've never had to deal with a death before, so I feel helpless.


My girlfriend's dad has a very rare disease. Think something similar to ALS/MS. The disease essentially causes you to slowly deteriorate until you die. The disease is cripplingly painful. Typically, victims of this disease die within 5-7 years of the onset, although a small amount of people survive longer. My girlfriend's dad is in his 7th year of the disease and things are not looking good.

This has definitely caused some friction in our relationship. I've never had to deal with a close family member or friend dying, let alone to such an awful disease. I do, however, have experience with family members and friends contracting non-terminal diseases, disorders, cancer, etc. My grandfather has had 3 strokes and is barely functional. My grandmother has survived various cancers 5 times. My mother has a disease that she refuses to disclose to us because she believes it will kill her one day. My father is very unhealthy and will probably have a heart attack within 5 years. He also has a disease known as hemachromatosis which fucks up your body due to high iron.

My girlfriend is constantly depressed. I'm worried the loss of her father will lead to a deep depression. She is already very depressed. This depression is also the source of much anger. There are times where my girlfriend will break down over how she sees all these people that have healthy parents, while her dad is withering away. Sometimes she gets mad at me for having never had to deal with her father's disease. She'll say that I can never possibly understand what she's going through, and even though it's not my fault she is envious of my ""healthy"" parents. It affects on her a daily basis. At many of my family gatherings, she will mentally check out because she is surrounded by healthy family members and it causes her to remember her sick dad, which then depresses her. If she goes out to dinner with a friend, she will mentally check out because a night out seems so insignificant compared to her father's situation. Her dad always gains a lot of energy when I'm around, so I try to spend a lot of time with him so that my girlfriend can see him in a good mood. But, even spending time with her dad depresses her.

I don't know how to help. It seems that no matter what route we go, it will lead to more depression. I try to provide hope, offer new suggestions for ways to help (pain management, therapy, etc), and generally just try to comfort her. Whatever I do, though, it doesn't feel like it's enough. I'm worried my girlfriend is already well into a dark pit, and once her father passes away she'll never make it out. 

I don't know what to do, reddit. I don't know how to help my girlfriend out of this depression. I'm worried that I won't be able to offer enough to help her. Please help.

"I (20f) don't know how to get it through my friend's (27f) head that I am not interested in her ""catch"" of a friend (28m)


EDIT: thank you for all of the responses! I texted her and told her I will not be talking to him or trying to pursue a relationship with him and she said she understands and we left it at that. I plan on cutting her out of my life- many of you have brought to my attention that I shouldn't have to feel like this when it comes to a friendship and I agree! 

I (20f) just got out of a year and a half long relationship (thats another story). My friend (27f) and I just recently reconnected after a dramatic fallout (she's VERY immature, the only reason I haven't cut her off completely is because of how dramatic she is- at this point I'm just trying to be civil to avoid problems) and I brought up the fact that I was newly single. 

After telling her what happened between my ex and I, she gave my full name, phone number, and snapchat to this friend of hers who she swears is a catch and if she wasn't with her current boyfriend she would've gone for him. She also added that since I ""only date ugly boys,"" I won't care that he's unnattractive (????). After he added me, we had a VERY brief talk. He tried to be funny and I was too exhausted and uninterested to care. 

He's 8 years older than me and around the same age as my older brother and older sister. I have nothing against relationships with age gaps, but for me it would not work. I had posted a status on facebook about how I miss being in a relationship but I'm glad I'm single (I know, I disgust myself too) and she texted me.
-her: Woah, your post. I take it you didn't talk to my friend? 
-me: he has my snapchat and we talked briefly, but we haven't had a full blown convo. I feel like I'm too immature to be talking to him. I struggle with talking to guys even 2 or 3 years older than me, so this is difficult 
-her: blah blah blah. idk i think hes a catch. i really mean it. i want you to push yourself to do something different. i think you are mature and every dude you've been with isn't and they don't take you seriously. 

I ignored her, but this kind of thing happens ALL the time. I say no and she just won't take no for an answer. no matter what i do, she isn't going to be happy with it. If I were to get a new boyfriend, she would be mad that it wasn't her friend she's trying to hook me up with. What am I supposed to do to get it through her head that I cannot date someone thats nearly 10 years older than me?

TLDR: My friend (27f) insists her friend (28m) is a huge catch despite me voicing how uncomfortable by the situation I (20f) am. How can I communicate to her that I will not be pursuing a friendship or a relationship with him without making her upset?"
"I am madly in love with my wife (41f) but I am no longer attracted to her. How do I (44m) deal with this?


I've been married to Sara for 10 years, together for 13. She has my heart and she is my entire life. She's my best friend. Everyday we are together, I feel like I fall more in love with her. She's my soul mate. 

I'm struggling however, because for the last 2 years.. I have no attraction to her. I brushed it off in the beginning to me being depressed, but it never went away. I still have no attraction. 

She hasn't changed much, except what you would expect. She no longer looks like she did when we got together (and I never expected her to, I knew she wouldn't) and I don't know. I find her absolutely stunningly beautiful inside and in her personality though. 

I don't want to get divorced, because as I said..I'm madly in love with this woman. I'd never want to be with anyone else. She's even joked that she's old and I'll leave her for a 20something. And no..Absolutely not. I wouldn't take anyone over my wife. 

Weve been in marriage counseling for awhile now (more so for our religious reasons, not because of issues) and I privately discussed it with the counselor, but she was no help. 

What do I do? I feel like she deserves someone who is totally attracted to her in every single way. Please help. Am I a horrible person? 

Tl;dr; madly in love with wife of 13 years.. But no longer attracted to her. I feel like the worst man in the world. What do I do?"

"Me [25 M] getting real tired of my [26 F] wife of 3 years, threatens me with divorce


I keep asking myself whether I should divorce or not a lot lately, a little background info first:

My wife comes from a different culture (Chinese) than me (Scandinavian), we have been living in my home country for 2 years now and things haven't been as good as they were before we got married.

The things we quarrel about mostly is money. She comes from a family where her father is a banker (very rich) while I come from a worker class background. 

The latest incident was this: she is going back to her home country to visit her parents and asked me to follow her to the capital airport, which means I have to fly there with her. Now, I told her it's too expensive and not really ""necessary"" for me to pay ~200 USD just for me to accompany her there and say good bye there instead of my city's airport. She said she is worried about finding the way inside the airport but everyone speak English and can help her, and I also offered to guide her from a phone call or a video conversation, no problems. 

After this she became very enraged and called me greedy, that I care more about money than love (which is not true). During my last years of my studies I took out a bigger loan so I could give her more material comfort. I'm pretty deep in the red right now because of this. Oh, and she also said she wanted a divorce because: ""we have too different values in life"".

Before this she also said that her parents could pay for me, but I'm an adult and I don't want to be a burden on them, I want to show them that I can manage on my own and take care of my wife and me, which works fine until things like this happens. And also, no matter how rich someone is, I still feel it's a waste to spend 200 USD just to spend a few hours more with someone, especially since we will see each other again.

Now, some of her friends and even my mother in law calls me greedy. I'm sure this is a cultural clash, I just can't understand it. It's better to use this money on a down payment of a house, or a trip somewhere, or pay down my debt. Just throwing away 200 USD for something like this seems frankly crazy to me, it's probably because of my background maybe? I'm soon graduating and will only make 23k USD/year post tax. Yes, salaries are lower here than in USA.....that's why 200 USD is even a bigger deal to me.

Tell me your honest opinion, am I just greedy and selfish? I truthfully love her but she believes I don't love her because I didn't want to follow her to the capital's airport.....well, I would if I had a lot of money of course.

**TL;DR; : My wife wants a divorce because she believes I care more about money than her**.on!

"I [26F] am scared to tell my friends and family that my husband [27M] have bought a house. Feeling guilty.


My husband and I recently put in an offer on a house and it has been accepted. Inspection is good and we have the financing, so unless something unforeseen happens, we should be moving into our home at the beginning of April. We are both so excited but at the same time I am terrified to tell some of our friends, and my older sister.

My husband and I had a good chunk of saving anyways, because we are responsible with our money. However we recently got a decent settlement from a car accident, and we were able to pay off our debts and have enough left over for a small downpayment. Our city isn't an affordable place to live but we lucked out an a good house in our price range.

We still have friends that work 7 days a week just to make ends meet. I have one friend who filed for bankruptcy at 24. We have other friends who were looking at houses but resigned their apartment lease because they couldn't afford it this year.

Then there is my older sister. She is swimming in debt, still lives with room mates and her husband only just got a minimum wage job after she supported him for 3 year (medical reasons). When I brought up buying a house she instantly got all huffy and then tried to brag about the house she plans to buy when she gets out of debt. She hates that I am ""doing better"" than her. She made snarky comments when I got married before her, and straight up told me I wasn't allowed to have babies before her. She has been on the fence about trying for kids, and when i recently told her about my miscarriage almost a year ago, her response was ""oh....well I'm going of birth control next week!"".

I want to share our good news. It's not like we can hide it forever. Friends and family will want to come visit us. I have no intentions of bragging about our house, but I don't want to deal with any negative comments that might come from telling people. I don't consider myself ""lucky"" that my husband and I got into a life threatening car accident that gave us some money. I'm still dealing with PTSD and wish it never happened.

I just want to be able to be excited and tell people without feeling guilty.
