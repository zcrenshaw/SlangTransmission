"I (29/f) am concerned about PPD and ""doing it all"" when my husband (28/m) just lost his dad (UPDATE after 6 months)


It’s been a while, and I wanted to provide an [update from my post six months](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59iugz/i_28f_am_concerned_about_ppd_and_doing_it_all/) ago detailing my PPD and loss of FIL. You guys had been extremely helpful, and I know I PERSONALLY like seeing happy updates. So here is mine.

However, before I get on to the update, I wanted to clarify one thing: My husband didn’t actually know ahead of time his father was sick or going to die. I don’t want to get into too many details, but he was okay, then things went downhill instantly, and then a few days later he was actually gone.

Now off to the update! First off, I took a lot of advice to heart. I’m going to do a list so I don’t talk your ear off!:

* I insisted on talking this out with my husband. I explained my concerns, grievances, and needs, and he picked up his portion right away. He has not slacked off since. He took me on a really fancy date shortly after. We have regular dates where I feel like his *wife* again.

* MIL came home, and we now had two possible babysitters.

* I brought up my issues with my therapist, and we’d utilized CBT for other issues I had, so this was a no brainer. We meet weekly. I also brought up the martyr like way I handled everything, as someone pointed out. Because they were right.

* Pysch upped my regular dose of antidepressant and added something temporary for anxiety. We meet monthly.

* I paid for temporary maid service.

* I went back in to work. That has helped a LOT. Sometimes my husband and I meet for lunch for babysitter-unnecessary dates, and other times I meet my own friends for lunch. I am excelling at work, which makes me work harder. I feel in my element. She is in daycare, and she also loves that. She has a favorite teacher already.

* I insisted sex be more “mutual.” He was on board. When that happened, other self-care routines returned. I get my hair done, wear nicer clothes, and make sure my makeup is done.

* I dropped the hurtful friends. Not in hateful or dramatic ways, but slow fades, blaming the (admittedly true) lack of time in my life.

As a result, my husband and I feel stronger than we had in a while. I feel like an individual, a wife, AND a mom. I’m also bonding better now with her. I’m delighting in seeing new skills just click for her, and her smiles/chatting/laughs bring me joy.

Thank you, Reddit.

"Me [30M] with my sister [32F], her son [11M] died and she's been staying with me, we (her family) are all worried she's wasting away, what can I do to help?


My nephew &amp; her son died in 2015 at the age of 11 and my sister  moved in with me several months later at my request because I felt like a little company might help. I won't pretend I know what it's like for her, losing my nephew was painful enough and it's likely a hundred thousand times worse for her.

Her engagement fell apart because she just couldn't do it anymore. She wasn't in any state to get married and ended things completely, we all tried to convince that maybe just putting off the wedding but not ending the engagement was a good idea but she cut off her fiance of 5 years (engaged for 1.5 yrs at the time) and just spiraled downwards. So I asked her to move in with me and she did. She has money &amp; contributes but that isn't my problem, I'd gladly foot the bill but outside of that and chatting sometimes, she's just quiet, stays in her room, she doesn't cry as much as she used to but she still cries a lot. She won't open up to our parents or sister (younger). She's ignored all her friends and even her best friend has stopped trying though she's admitted it's something my sister will need to work through when she's ready but she (the best friend) has to focus on herself and her own marriage and child for now. Her best friend had a son some time before my nephew died so I wonder if that's part of the reason she won't open up to her best friend of 20 years. 

I've suggested maybe speaking to a therapist but she doesn't care to see one. Is there anything I can do? How do I help?

"UPDATE: I [22F] have finally found the courage to leave my now ex-boyfriend [26M] after finding out he cheated on me for the third time, but I don't know how to let him go

After the incredible and overwhelming replies and messages I got from this post, I was able to gather up that last bit of courage that I really needed to go cold turkey and cut him off. 

I honestly don't think I could have done it without everyone's help. Thank you all, so much - for the tough love, the advice, the analogies of my behaviour against that of a drug addicts and all the rest that finally made me see sense.

"I [25F] did not miss my fiance [28M] when he was away on a business trip.


My fiance, Dave, and I have been together for over six years now. We met when we where both undergraduates in college. I was eighteen at the time and he was 21. 

Dave is an all-around good guy. Most of my family just adores him, especially my grandmother. He has really stood by me. After we had been together for about a year, I developed a serious illness. Even though I can tell it really scared him, he stood by me and gave me all of the support he could. I eventually made a full recovery. 

A year after I learned my illness was in remission, I graduated college and accepted an internship out of state. Dave could not feasibly go with me to the internship for a variety of reasons -- my room and board was paid for by my employer and Dave was finishing up grad school. For over a year, we lived apart. Dave was very supportive and even drove to see me once, an incredible feat considering the state of his car at the time and the distance he had to cover to see me. 

When my internship was nearing its end, I was offered a job in a rural area very far away from all of mine and Dave's friends and family. I accepted the job because it paid incredibly well and because it would offered me experience unlike what I could get in other places. Dave really stuck his heals in the sand on this one. He said that he, freshly minted from grad school, wouldn't be able to find a job in his line of work anywhere in the area, that I was basically forcing him into unemployment if he were to move with me. He told me that he couldn't do long distance again, that either we stay together or break up. I think he was hoping that I would return to our college town where he still lived and search for a job there. 

I did not back down. I told Dave that I was happy to do long distance and that he could come with me or that he could stay where he was, that that would be his choice. He eventually caved and moved with me, finding a job in his field almost immediately. 

We have been living in this rural area for over a year now. Dave has proposed and I enthusiastically said yes. We are now in the thick of wedding planning. I thought I was happy until Dave went on a business trip. While he was only gone for ten days, his absence has really given me a new outlook on our relationship. 

I did not miss Dave. Every day I came home from work and watched whatever I wanted to watch on TV. I cooked whatever I wanted to cook. I went to bed when I wanted to, not having to worry about Dave coming in much later and waking me, like he usually does. I slept better than I have in a really long time as Dave snores and disturbs my sleep at night. I did not miss Dave at all. 

I also started to think about all of the things I do not like about Dave. He complains a lot about almost everything. He really does not like the area we moved to and constantly reminds that he would be making SO much more money if he had stayed in our college town and gotten a job there. This makes me feel really guilty and while I have been outspoken about how those words make me feel, he still constantly complains to me. Dave also complains about his job, even though it is in the field he studied and went to grad school for. Dave also complained heavily while he was in school -- about the stress of classes, how much he hated his part time job, etc. I just thought it was the stress of the situation and would one day get better. He still complains, however, and while I know we are not in his ideal setting, we also make plenty of money, have health insurance, live in a nice house, drive nice cars, etc. Our lives are pretty decent and we enjoy a higher standard of living than we have ever previously had as adults. 

Dave is also a slob. I groaned this morning when I woke up and saw that Dave had ""unpacked"" from his business trip by dumping his entire suitcase out onto the living room. When Dave was out of town, the house stayed clean. There were no crumbs on the table or mystery plates in the sink when I woke up in the morning. This might be TMI, but the toilet was also much cleaner (no ""splatters"", if you know what I mean). 

All in all, I felt a lot less stressed. I'm usually the one who cooks dinner and cleans (even though we both work). Coming home and only having to take care of myself was such a nice reprieve. I actually dreaded Dave returning. 

Now, all of today, I felt awful and anxious. I realized that I'm not sure I want to go through with the wedding. I fantasized all day about moving to New York City, a place Dave has said is out of the question for us because he doesn't think he'll find a job there, and living alone or with a roommate. I dreamed of my tidy room and the healthy dinners I like to cook when Dave is not around to eat them or when I prepare another meal that's more suitable to his palate. I dreamed of all the free time I would have just taking care of myself.

But then the bubble burst because I realized that maybe one day, I would want to have a romantic partner again. Dave has his faults, but so does everyone. I am not an angel either. I often have a short temper and can at times be impulsive. Dave loves me and wants to marry me in spite of those faults. I feel terrible for loving my life in Dave's absence and for wishing us to no longer be together. Is this how all long term relationships work? Is this a normal way to be feeling about someone you are engaged to marry?

"My (30, F) co-worker (33, F) wants my weekend time too


I (30, F) have been working in a small office with my co-worker (34, F) for six years. We were hired at the same time. I need advice as to whether I should be more firm with her regarding my boundaries or whether I should be more accommodating because six years is a long time to know someone. We have very different ideas of what our relationship is. 

I have clear work/life separation, and want to do great work when I am at the office, but during my off time want to be fully present in my private life with my family and friends. I do not want to be reminded of work, and I treasure my hobbies and weekend time to recharge with loved ones. 

My coworker is the exact opposite. She makes personal friends out of those on our work team, and asks me every week to do things with her and them on the weekend. I always say no. 

I thank her for inviting me, but tell her that honestly I will never attend weekend events with people I see 45 hours a week at work; that I have family and friends to see on the weekend and am busy with my personal life. I have told her more than once that she should stop inviting me to weekend events, it will not hurt my feelings, and it is tiresome telling her no every week. I would feel fine if her continued invitations were just out of politeness and I got the idea that she expects that I will say no, but she acts very shocked each time and tells me that she is surprised and offended that I don't plan on attending. No one else on our team invites me and I appreciate it. 

This co-worker will not give up. She has told me repeatedly that it is hurtful that I do not invite her to my weekend events and do not attend hers. She says it is not normal to spend as long as we have together and not have met each other's families. She pressures me to say I will make a real effort to stay in contact with her when the day comes that we are no longer working together. I find all of this unprofessional and will not promise her any such thing. I tell her that we are co-workers who see each other 45 hours a week, it is enough time together already. 

My co-worker runs to show me pictures of her weekend every Monday saying, ""Why didn't you come to this!? It was so fun! Please come with us next weekend!"" and I say, ""I'm glad you had fun, but I will not be joining.""  She often texts me during the weekend and after work and I do not respond to her texts. I don't respond to anything that isn't about work and during working hours. Her lack-of-boundaries bleeds over into work matters, as she is continually distracted from her tasks and does lots of personal chores on company time, but I am not her boss so I just ignore it and focus on my work. I have earned two promotions since we were hired and she has not earned any. I was hoping this last promotion would come with a change in teams, but unfortunately it didn't. I have some anxiety around always having to ""manage"" this person and push her away, and am wondering if I should stop talking to her altogether or grey rock, or just keep doing what I'm doing, or even schedule a set coffee break with her once a week to make her feel like I'm spending time with her so she'll ease up possibly. I have no idea. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a terrible and unfriendly person to be complaining about someone who wants to be friends with me. Other times I am just exhausted by her.

Is there anything else I can do in this situation? Thank you for your advice. 

**TL;DR: My co-worker wants to spend seven days a week with me, how do I maintain a professional relationship with a non-professional person?**"

"My ex [22M] and and I [22F] broke up after he gave me an ultimatum regarding my choice in jobs. Now he wants to try dating again. I'm very confused.


So, my job. I'm a bottle girl in a popular club. I run around all night bringing bottles to tables in v.i.p sections. I'm basically there to make sure the men in these sections get as drunk as possible, and get more female attention than they know how to handle. And obviously make money for the club.

Before this, I worked at a grocery store. Zach and i were part time cashiers, full time students. We were two broke students. I mean, poor. Extremely poor. Zach had higher rent than I did and I would do my best to keep him fed. It sucked. Really, really sucked. We were together for 5 months before the ultimatum.

So one day we were talking about changing jobs, and Zach mentioned that we should both get a second job. Some kind of night shift. We both started looking up jobs like crazy, I asked my friends, ect. One of my friends mentioned her friend, another bottle girl. Her club was hiring. So she gave me her friends number. After this, I texted Zach about the whole thing and at the time he seemed pretty excited about it all. He said it was awesome. He didn't take this chance to raise any concerns.

I text the girl and I end up going to the club to be interviewed not long after that. Since I basically had a referral, I got the job. I was ecstatic. The pay was much, much more than the grocery job. At this point I make twice as my old job, and on good weeks I make even more.  So I told Zach, with the intent of celebrating that we won't be broke anymore and that's when he gave me the ultimatum. When i saw him that night, Zach said the job is inappropriate, disgraceful, and he's not comfortable with me doing it. He said I need to call the club and tell them I changed my mind, or we would have to break up. I was completely surprised. He hadn't spoken up all at any point. He didn't even say anything when I was nervous before going to the club. He had a week and a half to raise any doubts.

So, we didnt argue but I was very firm that I needed this money, and i already had the job. I was tired of living this way. So, we broke up then and there.

So I cried, mourned the relationship and life went on. I've been at my new job for 5 months and I'm very happy. I've been able to get rid of the small credit debt that I did have, and I'm planning on getting my first car this summer.

Zach, for some reason, called me the other day. And he basically said that he missed me dearly, hes felt like he made a mistake ever since that day, and he apologized for springing the ultimatum on me. I told him it's all good, everything is forgiven and I apologized if I made him feel like he couldn't speak his mind or raise his concerns in the time before I got the job.

Zach asked me to get coffee with him, I said sure, and while we were there he mentioned he still worked at the grocery store and he didn't end up getting another job. I let him know im still a bottle girl. He also asked if I would consider dating him again because he feels like I'm the one that got away. I was shocked, and I told him I had a lot to think about. So now I need help figuring this out.

In general, do you guys think I should date him again? Will my job become an issue again, do you guys think he's pretending it's not an issue anymore?

Does ""taking back"" ultimatums even make sense? I'm concerned if we did date Id get another ultimatum at some point. Ultimatums = dealbreakers right? So do you think he's genuinely changed his mind about the job, or hes saying anything to get me back?

I realize people grow and mature, I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but I've also heard exes need to stay exes. I get that plenty of men would be unhappy if their gf had this job, and I do feel it might be foolish to try. I don't know.

Basically, if you were me would you date Zach again? I'm 50% yes and no at this point. He was an awesome guy, but obviously there were communication issues. Ones so bad that we got to the point where I was surprised by an ultimatum.

Tl:dr: ex changed his mind about the ultimatum that broke us up and wants to date again. Should I? Do you think he's being genuine?"
"My mom[45F] always steals my[21F] style. Most of the time I brush it off but this time I told her no. She didn't take that well. I just want some things of my very own. Need advice. Non-romantic.


If this is in the incorrect subreddit, or if there is a better subreddit for me to post in, please advise!


Compared to other posts in this subreddit this may seem petty. However, I need opinions of who is in the wrong and advice, if any.


My mom[45F] seems to always copy or steal the things I[21F] wear. When I've shopped in the misses section in the past, she does for herself too. I start shopping at a certain store, she does too. I start wearing Express brand jeans, she does too. I start putting on cat-style liquid eyeliner, she tries to too. 

She will steal my clothes and I basically never get to see said stolen item again for several reasons, and if I do it is not in the same condition it was when she stole it. She will wear said stolen item several times a week and always store it back in her room/closet. 
She is around a size 6-10 while I am around a size 0-2 so she stretches out/mis-shapes the things she steals. (I’m sorry if that sounds mean.) 
She imbeds my clothes with the smell of smoke and strong perfume, both of which I cannot stand the smell of. She usually just hangs the things she wears up for at least 2 weeks to a month before she washes them. 
So basically she steals the item in pristine condition and then either never returns it or it’s practically ruined. One time I stole a shirt back and she got all huffy puffy about it.


Now, onto the most recent issue.  


A few weeks ago I ordered 12 different matte liquid lipsticks. Yes, 12. I had them all in a cup on my dresser near my door. She notices them and looks through them and says how she doesn't like any of them. (I'm thinking...Good.) 
About a week later we go out to dinner with my family and I wear said lipstick. I had to get ready in her bathroom since my brother was showering in ours. I left the cup of lipsticks in her bathroom. Goddammit. Anyways, she says at dinner ""Oh, I like that one!"" 
So a couple of days later she comes home from wherever and I notice she is wearing that lipstick. My blood begins to boil. I ask to confirm if it is my lipstick and of course it is. I steal back my cup of lipsticks and put them on my dresser under my tv. 
She comes into my room today after going to the grocery store and is like ""Ohh, there's those lipsticks!"" and starts going through them ""Can I have these two?, Can I have this one? Can I give you the money and you can just buy another?"" ""No."" ""That's tight!!!"" Then she storms out of the room. About 5 minutes later she comes back into the room practically stomping to 'throw out a water bottle.' I currently have the biggest garbage can in my room since I'm sick and blowing my nose every two seconds, but there's like 3 other garbage cans to throw them in upstairs alone. All while saying ""I can't believe you won't blah blah blah even after I went to the store and got you this this and this!"" -.- Yes, I appreciate that she got stuff for me while at the store. When she was sick I drove her to the doctor, laid in bed with her, and offered to go to the store every day and went two-three times for her. It doesn’t have to do with the lipsticks at all in my opinion.

Now she’s made me feel absolutely guilty and a bad person for it. She has an incredibly short temper so I won’t be surprised if I get shit for the next week for it. She is almost impossible to confront without her just immediately yelling at me. 
I just want a couple of things that are my very own. I want to be different in a couple of ways. I do not want everything I wear to be copied or stolen. I just want to be my own unique person once in a while! I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone. Maybe I’m being selfish. 


Tl;dr: My mom[45F] always steals my clothes and most recently my[21F] lipsticks. She got all pissy/upset when I told her no she couldn’t have/use them. I just want a few things of my very own to be my own person once in a while! 


Does anyone have any advice on what to do from here or words of wisdom? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So, I've been friends with this guy for a bit over 10 years. You're probably assuming that this is some sort of ""friend zoning"" situation where he's been holding a torch for me for years - I assure you that this isn't the case (...I don't think. 99% sure). You see, throughout the whole course of our friendship, he's basically identified as gay. Went on dates with guys, talked about wanting to find some guy to grow old with, *completely* platonic towards me (and other girls). We've hung out drunk and alone together on countless occasions without even a hint of a move, no flirting, no interest. He's been like a brother to me. I say ""basically,"" because he *has* identified more as bi in the past (been with a girl or two before we met), he just wasn't really interested any more.

We've had a lot of deep talks, gone on road trips together etc, but we only hang out once every week or two and basically don't communicate in the mean time. It's fun when we hang, but we're not super close in any sort of ""regular contact"" sort of way, I guess is what I'm getting at, even though I'd still consider him one of my ""best"" friends. ANYWAY.

So, a few weeks ago, he calls me up, asks what I'm up to, and when I say, ""not much,"" says he has something to ask me and can he come over. This is already pretty weird, we *never* drop in on each other randomly in the middle of the afternoon, and we just saw each other a couple days ago. He shows up acting nervous, beats around the bush a bit, and then blurts out, ""Would you want to get married and have kids with me?"" I laugh in his face. I don't get the joke, but it's *clearly* a joke... right? He's not laughing. Oh shit.

My brain is all kinds of WTF. Is he having some sort of mental break? Is he dying of cancer? This is *definitely* a joke but I still don't get it. I ask a few questions. He's dead serious. I don't understand what is happening *at all*, but I make it as clear as possible that my answer is definitely 100% no, also WTF, and NO, and WTF??! all while trying not to be *too* mean about it. He leaves shortly after (seeming disappointed but not devastated) and my brain is exploding with questions and confusion and WTF.

I process a bit over the next few days, realize I have a lot of questions I *need* answered for my sanity and also to figure out if there's any hope of even still being friends after this. So we meet up again a few days later (after I make it clear that this isn't some sort of interview where the right answers might change my mind, it's 100% NO, I just really need to understand where the hell this is coming from) and I start blasting through my questions:

- Are you dying of cancer?
- No.

- Are you secretly in love with me?
- No.

- Did you ask because you thought *I* was secretly in love with *you*?
- No.

- Are you having some sort of psychotic episode? Should I be getting you help?
- I don't *think* so, I *feel* pretty normal, no weird mood swings or anything. But then again, how would I know?

- Why on earth wouldn't you try to lead up to something like that by maybe asking my thoughts on marriage and babies in general or something first?
- I thought I *did* do the lead-up option. I didn't even have a ring or get down on one knee!
- Oh. My. GOD.
- I mean, if you want a ring, I can go get one right now...
- Oh my god shut the fuck up you are insane.
- Just sayin.

- You know I don't particularly even *want* to get married and have kids, right?
- Well I certainly *wouldn't* want you to do anything you didn't *want* to! But, I really thought there was a non-zero chance that you'd say yes.

- ...HOW.

So then, lots of questions about *why*. What the hell brought this on, made this seem like a reasonable idea, how on earth does he *not* think this is insane, etc etc.

What I managed to get from him was a lot of different things. A big one was that he has a group of friends from a cultural background where arranged marriages are common, and they ""make it seem so simple. You just do it and you make it work."" So the fact that we'd never even had a romantic relationship didn't seem like a big deal to him. And of course, ""romance fades anyway, so it doesn't matter."" His parents have a fairly platonic relationship so that feels pretty normal to him. On that topic, his dad's apparently made jokes to him about us getting married, so that's an influence too I guess.

He wants a family. He wants someone to grow old with. Which made me feel like he just wanted to use me to fill a role, but he got offended at that interpretation and very passionately started insisting that he *didn't* want just anyone, he wanted *me*. Going on about ""seeing what was right in front of him,"" that we ""never had a bad time together"", that he trusted me and felt safe with me and ""committed"" to me. That he'd never once wanted to make an excuse to bail when we made plans, that if there was something I wanted to do or that was important to me then he was always 100% down. That I was loyal and smart and he always valued my opinion on things. That he considers me his best and closest friend. There was some stuff in there at one point about getting old and how he was starting to feel like ""the bachelor uncle"" (pretty much all his relatives are married with babies at this point), so I'm like half flattered and half insulted, I don't even know.

When I comment on the ""out-of-nowhere-ness,"" he says that he understands it feels really sudden to me, but he's been thinking about it for a while. That he's been ""trying to work up the courage to ask"" for *months*, but didn't want to ""ruin our good time"" with something ""heavy."" I feel weird about how long he's apparently been thinking about this with me having no idea.

After I feel like I *sort* of understand kinda where he's coming from, I once again reiterate my ""NO"" (I'm really paranoid about giving him false hope or leading him on), and he responds that if I think it's a terrible idea then I'm probably right. He says that he'll be fine either way, he just thought ""it would be nice."" He seems pretty okay with it and seems to drop it, despite leaving a little half-joking-but-also-not ""well if you change your mind..."" hanging there.

So... I start to think we can maybe move on. I'll give it a couple weeks and we'll hang out and we'll see if it's Weird or not. So we hung out last night and it was all chill and fun like normal old times for a while, and then IT came up and OMG. He started using terminology like ""*if* we get married"" (which I shot down every time), randomly showed me his bank balance and told me he has almost enough saved to buy a house loan-free, and the kicker - told me he's been thinking about this for *years*. Not the months he said before. I don't know how seriously he considers the ""thinking about it"" to be, if it was maybe just the seed of an idea in passing, but it feels like this is coloring *everything* now. When he made me breakfast that one time after I crashed in his guest room - was he trying to be a good host, or a ""good husband?"" When it was cold and snowy and he offered to go clear off my car for me - was he being a good friend, or a ""good husband?"" Did he suggest that fun roadtrip because he thought it would be fun, or because he wanted to prove to himself (and me) that we could get along well just the two of us, for days at a time?

I know what he'd say. He'd be offended at my suggesting he could be so calculating and manipulative. That he's happy with how things are. That he does things for me because we're friends and he likes making his friends happy.

I don't want to lose my friend. But I have no idea if that's even possible. Or if I even really know him. Maybe he *is* crazy. Or maybe he's just a bit aspergers or something that makes the social weirdness of this not seem that weird to him.


I'm losing my mind a bit over this. I catch myself thinking about it a *lot* in a kind of ""if life was a video game and I could make a save point, how would this play out"" kind of way. I do *not* want this. But it's weirdly compelling in a trainwreck sort of way I guess? Mostly I feel really bad for my friend that he feels so... alone? I guess? And I'm also terrified that next time I see him he's gonna confess his undying love for me or something. Or something equally crazy.

I need perspective. Am I overreacting by being freaked out? Underreacting by not running away screaming ASAP? I have no idea what to think or do. We really are quite close and have had a lot of really fun times over the years, it would suck to have to walk away from this. If he does turn out to be in love with me or something and not just... confused and lonely though, I think I'll have to.

TL;DR - Close friend randomly suggested marriage and babies. Need advice on WTF

Edit: Thank you all so much for your comments and replies, I've read every single one even if I couldn't reply to them all. It was immensely helpful to me, even seeing the full range of reactions from basically ""omg he's a serial killer RUN"" to ""I don't see what the big deal is, you should go for it."" For now, I'm finding myself agreeing with the general consensus of time and space being necessary for him to hopefully move on from this idea. I'm quite certain that he won't see the need for such, but I'll do my best to explain my thinking - I'm not gonna just ghost a friend after so long without a heads-up. Even if he doesn't agree, I know he'll respect my decision on this at least. I'll give it 2-3 months and then reassess. No contact shouldn't be too hard in practice, given our low level of contact normally any way. I'll give an update regardless. Thanks again all!"

"My family is angry at me [24M] for letting my girlfriend [20F] come with me to my grandma's house as she was on her deathbed.


My grandmother was 92 when she passed away. In the early morning four days ago, I got a call from my dad [70M] that my grandma was at the hospital for a minor cold. He said that I shouldn't worry about it. The next day, my grandma was discharged from the hospital. 

Two days ago, I was out walking in the park with my girlfriend of a few years. This was in the afternoon. Suddenly, I received a call from my brother [34M] telling me to come over to our grandmother's house. Her cold had come back and it was more severe this time.

I asked my girlfriend to come with me for support. By the time we arrived, my whole family: parents, aunts, uncles, brothers, cousins were in the house and hallway. I knew something really serious was happening. My gf stayed in the hallway as I went into her bedroom. My grandma looked really unwell and my dad was crying. I said some things to her. I don't think she heard me but she was holding my hand the whole time.

Two hours later, she passed away. This whole time, my girlfriend was in the house consoling me. She was very supportive and it helped me a lot. But I noticed that she was the only non-family member in the house. 

She left sometime after my grandma passed. I spent the night at the house with my mum and my brothers and uncle/aunt, supporting dad and grandpa. In the morning, my uncle pulled me aside and told me that I should not have brought my girlfriend with me during such a personal family tragedy. He lectured me and said that it was disrespectful to my family to let a stranger come in uninvited, and reminded me that my older brother didn't bring HIS girlfriend over. He thought that it was disrepsectful how I let a ""stranger"" see my father crying and in his most vulnerable moment.

My uncle said that my dad ""probably"" felt the same way and that I should apologize to him. I didn't mention this conversation to my father because he has a lot on his mind right now. My uncle says that other members of our family who were present also think that letting my gf accompany me was very ""unorthodox"".

I asked my mother whether I made a faux pas and she just said that she understood and that we all need somebody to comfort us in difficult times. She thinks my uncle is overreacting.

I don't know what to think...my family has always been very traditional and ""exclusive"" in this sense. For example, we used to spend every Christmas at my grandma's country home. My brothers and I were never allowed to bring our girlfriends/friends over for those things. Even my eldest brother couldnt bring over his GF (now wife) until they were engaged. 

Should I apologize to my family for bringing my girlfriend in during that intimate time? Were my actions rude? Or was what I did justifiable under the circumstances.

TL;DR: Brought GF over to my grandma's house when she was dying. Later my uncle (and presumably other family members) think that her presence was rude and unnecessary..."

"My dad[58 M] screwed me [28 M]. My wife [25 F] is pissed, and idk how to proceed.


Back when I was finishing up my freshman year of college, my dad saw my living situation as an investment opportunity. Rather than just pay rent in a college town, he thought it wise to purchase a property, reap the benefits of deductible expenses, rent the rooms, and sell it when it inevitably appreciated in value. He purchased the condo in late 2006, at the height of the market, and I don't need to tell you what happened to the housing market shortly thereafter. However, the kicker is that in order to reap some of those benefits, he needed me to sign on the mortgage in order to qualify it as a primary residence or something. I was 18 at the time, my dad was a good dad that always provided for me, and he was a CPA that is generally really good with money so I signed without giving it much thought.


Fast forward four years, to early 2011ish, and the property is so unbelievably underwater that my dad decides to let it go into foreclosure. My parents' house is paid for, he has enough savings to be liquid, so he doesn't really mind the hit to his credit, and he assures me he will help me out with cash if it hurts my credit.
 

Between now and then, I've gotten married, and my wife and I just started the preliminary process of researching buying a home. Even though I signed the mortgage, it has never shown up on my credit report and I've maintained a credit score of 780+. But in the process of being pre-qualified, it has surfaced and we've been told that we can't get a loan for at least 3 years since the foreclosure was official (June 2016). My wife made some mistakes with credit cards when she was in college and she's building her credit back up, but qualifying through her isn't an option right now.

Ultimately, I trusted my dad as a naive 18 year old and he got burned on an investment that's affecting my life. We've never been all that close, but, I want to reiterate that my dad has always provided for me in any way. I needed a loan back in August which he gave me, and I've been paying it back interest free every month since. But now we're stuck renting for another 2.5 years and my wife is pissed. She thinks my dad only acted in his financial interests (which I agree with) and it's having an unfair effect on our life as a married couple. She said she doesn't want me to pay my dad back any of the money I still owe him, but I don't think I want to get into an ""eye for an eye"" type situation as that could just lead to things getting messy. I just don't know how to tackle this situation. I think I need to have an open and direct conversation about this with both of my parents in the room on my own, but I just don't know. I have always valued my family and I love my wife dearly and I just want to avoid this becoming a wedge between all of us. I can really see this spiraling if it's not approached the right way and I don't want that to happen.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Dad had me sign on a mortgage when I was 18 that has recently foreclosed. Wife is pissed we can't get a loan because of said foreclosure. How do I keep this from being a wedge between my family and me/my wife?"

"[21, F] My boyfriend [24, M] is all over me about working out and being fit and it's killing my confidence.


So i'll give a short backstory here because there is some kind of odd scenario leading to this. My boyfriend was kind of a screw up in highschool and he ended up getting sent to this boot camp type program when he was 17 for breaking into a house. It was one of those where you complete their program and you avoid any jail time when you turn 18. One of their big things was physical fitness and he went from being kind of a typical chubby guy to being very fit, running miles a day, hundreds of pushups, pull ups, etc.

So ever since then he has sworn up and down that his little calisthenics program is a life saver, made him who he is, etc. I always liked how motivated he was and his body looks fantastic so it was always just a win-win as his girlfriend. 

The problem started this year when he talked me into making a new years resolution to get more fit with him. He came up with an easy routine for a beginner to start working out and for the first few weeks it was fine. But over time he really ramped up how hard and how time intense it is. He wants me working out 7 days a week now and usually they take me well over an hour because i'm not strong enough to fly through 150 push-ups like he is.

So anyways, if I ever tell him I can't workout today he gets mad at me. He is the type that thrives on negative motivation, im assuming because of the boot camp background, so he does that with me too. He'll tell me i'm going to be another fat piece of shit in 10 years if I don't finish that set of push ups, or hold the plank the full time, or whatever else. He'll text me pictures or videos while i'm at work of him doing some super tough exercise I can't do (and that are probably not even possible for a woman to do) and say stuff like ""I'm the fucking king, now I need a queen"" or ""i'm getting even further ahead of you"" and stuff like that. He thinks they motivate me but in reality it just makes me feel bad. 

I have had a talk with him about how i'm not trying to be as fit as him and he just brushes that off as me making excuses. I've turned down workouts and he'll just mope and say ""fine, be unhealthy"" or something like that. Basically, he's overboard about his expectations for me and he can't understand that what works to motivate him (telling him he's a piece of shit, or he isnt a real man - he asks me to do that when he's slacking) doesn't work on me and makes me feel bad. Also his bragging about himself makes me feel horrible because he's basically just rubbing it in my face that he is way more attractive than me.

I know this paints a bad picture of him, and in 2017 he has been bad. But we have been together almost 2 years total and I really do love him. I know he loves me too and he wants to help me. He's just not comprehending that he isn't helping and see's any challenge to him as an excuse to be lazy. Have any of you had to deal with a situation like this? Is it something you can come out of and make the other person relax?

TL;DR:

- Boyfriend is a fitness enthusiast 

- I agreed to make a new years resolution to work out and get fit with him.

- He's pushing me way too hard and insulting me to motivate me and it's killing my self confidence
