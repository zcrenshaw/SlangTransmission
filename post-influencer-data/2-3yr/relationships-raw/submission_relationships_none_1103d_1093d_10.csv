"Update: I [28F] hate my boyfriend's [28M] beard.


Soo, my post from a few months ago didn't get a lot of attention but I wanted to post an update anyway. Here's the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m8j4m/i_28_hate_my_bfs_28m_beard/

Basically, my bf grew a disgusting beard that he didn't take care of and food got caught in it all the time. It was seriously affecting our sex life but he kept telling me I would learn to love his beard one day. Also, all our families and friends said the beard was great which was super weird because it wasn't. 

So, I did what some people suggested and told him I couldn't bring myself to have sex with him unless he starts grooming his beard because I'm so disgusted by it. He kind of laughed it off but after a week I guess he realized I was serious. 

So one day we met for dinner after work and he got there clean shaven and with a bouquet of roses. During dinner, he asked me if I honestly didn't remember. I had no idea what he was talking about. That's when he told me that 6 or 7 years ago, when we celebrated Christmas with my family and my grandfather was asking when the two of us would ""finally"" get married, my bf said we would get married when his beard was as long as my grandfather's (who has somewhat of a Santa Claus beard). 

For a few months  after that incident, it was like a running joke between the two of us, whenever he didn't shave for a few days, I told him to watch out or he would have to marry me. Apparently that was when he decided he would grow out his beard before proposing. Only he thought it would be too obvious and I would know what was coming, and I completely forgot about the whole situation and now I feel kind of bad about forgetting the whole joke between us. He said when I told him the beard was disgusting he thought I was just joking around because I wanted to know if he would really go through with growing it out grandfather style. 

Our friends and families were all in on it and that's why they kept saying the beard was great. So, long story short, the beard is gone and we are engaged. I guess this might seem a bit childish to a lot of people, but it made my grandfather happy and I think the original idea was kind of sweet (even though the beard wasn't). 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Bf only grew out his beard because of an inside joke we had years ago that I completely forgot about. We are now happily engaged and he shaves again. Yay!"
"Me [41 M] with my wife [ 38F] of ten years. A guy past away in a car accident and it has come forward that my wife was having an affair with him. She is in a deep depression regarding his death and I am angry and pissed and don't know what to do.


Um. Throwaway because of stuff.

This has been a nightmare I didn't think I'd face. I don't think all of our friends know, but I suspect some do but I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them.

There was a bad accident in our city that I barely registered (big city, traffic accidents happen all the time). When it came out who had died (two people hurt, different vehicles, only one fatality) my wife was really, really sobbing sad and asked to go to the funeral and she ""used to work with the guy."" Sure, absolutely, I'm so sorry this happened. 

But it has since come out from (from her) that they actually had a two year physical affair. I don't know how long they were just thinking about it.

She is a mess. She is devastated. She said she never meant to leave me, but that he was was a ""really special, remarkable person"" who meant a lot to her. She won't interact with our kids, stays in bed. I mean she's in mourning.

But FUCK! How long can I stand her moping around about the man she was having a fucking affair with?? I mean, I want her to get therapy and deal with it but I feel like there is a limit to how supportive I can be.

We have three kids, 8, 5 and 3 and she is a stay-at-home-mother, though I've had to take time off since this happened. It's a fucking mess. I feel like I can't leave because I don't think she could care for the kids on her own, and I hate and love her right now because she's done this.

What the fuck do I do?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Wife is massively depressed after the man she was having an affair with died. How do I support her grief while also laying down the line that I am pissed as fuck?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice. The vast majority of you all good folks have told me exactly what I need to hear. I think it coming from strangers makes it easier to hear. I'm running off to grab the youngest kidlet from preschool but will be back to respond. Thanks all."
"My husband [44/M] told me he wished I [37/F] was dead instead of his first wife. I'm devastated.


My husband ""Nick"" was married to his first wife ""Vanessa"" for 5 years and they had two amazing kids, ""Luke"" (15/M) and ""Lila"" (13/F). Sadly, Vanessa died in an accident 11 years ago when the kids were very young. I started dating Nick 8 years ago and we started off very slowly for obvious reasons. Nick has always been a little more distant than anyone I'd ever been with, but he and the kids lost Vanessa so young that I understood it. 

After 3 years of dating, Nick asked me to marry him and I moved in. I've always had a really great relationship with Luke and Lila and they were happy for me to marry their dad. I had wanted an actual wedding, nothing big, but Nick really didn't want one so we got married at the courthouse with just Luke and Lila present. We had a really fast engagement, but it worked for all of us. 

I have loved being Luke and Lila's stepmom and officially adopted them after I found out I was pregnant with our son ""Casey"" (2/M). The kids have been so great with Casey and help out so much. Nick was wonderful during the pregnancy and had always been a really loving dad and husband. 

But Nick has been pulling away a lot the last few months. He's been even more distant than usual and working late nights and going away with friends almost every weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he's been impatient with both me and the kids. I found out I was pregnant in June and am now 21 weeks pregnant with a girl. The kids are excited to have a little sister, but Nick just seems so indifferent to everything and everyone. He's been missing soccer games, Lila's birthday, doctors appointments, etc. Casey is too young to notice, but Luke and Lila are so hurt by their dad's absence. These kids are so good and they lost their mom so young and I'm infuriated that Nick is ignoring the kids like this. 

Last week, I finally sat Nick down and told him that he needs to stop disappearing and be more present in our lives. We're going to have another child soon and before we know it Luke and Lila will be grown up and going to college. After an hour of arguing, he screamed at me that he wished Vanessa was still alive and that I had switched places with her and died instead. He also threw in some awful comments that I need to stop pretending I'm Luke and Lila's ""real"" mom and that I'm only half the mom Vanessa was. The final straw was him saying that he never even wanted any kids with me, but did it so I'd ""keep busy and leave him alone.""

I'm so beyond hurt right now. I know I'm just his second choice, but I've always tried to honor Vanessa and tell Luke and Lila how lucky they were to have her as their mom. I love ALL of our kids more than anything and I'm just so heartbroken. Nick barely pays attention to Casey now and doesn't even acknowledge the pregnancy. He somewhat apologized this weekend and took all three kids to lunch, but he won't even look me in the eye. He seems like he wants to talk, but he doesn't say anything and I'm too upset to even be near him. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. Honestly, I can't even be around Nick right now and if there weren't any kids involved, I'd leave and never look back. I'm not sure if he's cheating or the thought of a fourth child is stressing him out, but I'm devastated and not sure how or why I should save this marriage, besides doing it for the kids. Any advice is desperately needed right now.

"My [27m] fiancee [26f] and I are finally in a place where we can get a dog. She just admitted that she doesn't want a dog, and never has. Considering ending things over this.


Hi reddit. My fiancee Ali and I have been together for 4 years, living together for 2, recently got engaged. Our relationship has been great for the most part, one of the few things we disagree on is animals. I love animals and Ali feels indifferent towards most animals. 

To give a little background about me - I've always been an animal lover. Throughout my childhood, my mom hated animals, especially dogs. My mom never let us have any pets and she used to tell us that once we were adults we could have whatever animals we wanted. 

When I moved away for college, I lived on campus for 4 years (and therefore couldn't have any pets). I've wanted a dog for as long as I could remember, but up until recently it wasn't in the cards for me to have a dog. Ali and I currently live in a not-so-pet-friendly city for renters. I always lived in apartments that never allowed pets, even with a pet deposit. 

When Ali and I met I told her about wanting to get a dog someday. Ali told me that she doesn't like a lot of dogs, but would be open to the right dog. This was in the very beginning of us meeting - I basically made it really clear that I will own a dog one day.

Throughout our relationship, I would occasionally bring up wanting a dog. Ali would remind me that our apartment doesn't allow for pets (which was true). Ali and I agreed that once we moved into a place that allowed for pets, we would look into getting a dog. 

About 2 months ago Ali and I moved into a house just outside of the city we work in. The house is a good size for the 2 of us (plus extra), the landlord is pet-friendly, and the house has a huge, fenced in yard. It's a much more residential area, and there's a dog park about 3 blocks from the house. 

On top of the house being perfect for a dog, I'm in a financial place where I can afford a dog. I make very good money and I don't have to travel for work. I'm mentally prepared for potential pet fees and other expenses for having people watch the dog. 

Since we're finally settled in the house, I decided to mention to Ali again about going to the shelter and looking at the adoptable dogs. Only this time, Ali didn't have an excuse for why we couldn't get one. After a few weak excuses (i.e. sometimes we go away), Ali broke down and told me that she doesn't want a dog. In fact, she's never wanted a dog. She was hoping I would forget about my dreams of wanting a dog. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying to reason with Ali but she said her answer will always be ""no"" to a dog. She just doesn't like them and doesn't want them. She basically gave me an ultimatum - either her, or my potential dog. 

I'm feeling shitty about this, because I always made it clear to her that I was going to want a dog someday. I feel like she was banking on something unrealistic, and now she's putting me in a lousy spot. 

Is there a way to compromise on this? 

TL;DR - Girlfriend and I can finally get a dog, she admitted that she doesn't want a dog and never has. She gave me an ultimatum - either her or a dog.

"UPDATE: How do me and my friends [20sF] tell our other friend [25F] we don't want her toddler to come on our vacation?


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t0r8j/how_do_me_and_my_friends_20sf_tell_our_other/

First of all I’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who posted something helpful and constructive . Every comment was read, even the negative (unfortunately). I’ve gotten quite a few messages to post an update over the past month. I initially held off because I was nervous about the surprising amount of attention it got and didn’t know whether Lily was an avid redditor or not.

So, despite our protests, Lily ended up bringing her toddler Elle on our cottage getaway.

Just kidding!

Within 24 hours of me posting, three of us got together and read over all the messages (now my friends know my reddit username….hiii guysss :/ ). We realized that we needed to get down to business and nip this situation in bud, before things escalated/we felt anymore resentment.

While this situation was happening, another one was going on on the side. My friend Ivy had made comments in the past about her and Lily drifting apart, as they are best friends. Quite understandably, Lily is SUPER busy being an awesome mom/fulltime employee so its hard getting friend time in. However, Ivy commented that they had only seen each other twice in past two and some months, and how she seemed like the only one ever making plans to hang out. She’s also the best communicator out of the group, so she decided that she would take it upon herself to speak with Lily directly that night. We didn't want to approach Lily as a group because it would have felt like we were attacking her, so we were more than happy with this approach.

From what I was told, she started off by casually bringing up the cottage and how much she was looking forward to it. Lily mentioned that she was excited to spend some time with all of us and that she couldn’t wait. Ivy then led the conversation in the direction of how she really loves spending time with Lily, that she wished it could happen more often, and even though she understood that Lily was a very busy gal, she felt like she was losing touch with Ivy somewhat.

Lily agreed, but reiterated that it is hard to find time for all the things that are important to her. So, Ivy continued and said something like, “Hey, I am SO excited to be spending time with you at the cottage this summer. However, it kind of hurt my feelings that it took your fiancée to be leaving for the weekend for you to decide to come and spend the weekend with us. (Not sure if I mentioned this in the first post, but initially Lily said no to the cottage because she wanted to focus on her family all summer. However, her fiancee wanted his own mini vacation, and when she found out it was on the same weekend as ours, she finally decided to come). But that’s okay, I understand that family time is very important to you. I just feel that since we haven’t been getting a lot of time to see you lately, the cottage weekend would be a great place for us all to reconnect. I feel like you need a break from life for just a couple days, since you’ve got so much going for you, and having Elle stay with your family friend while your fiancée is away is the perfect opportunity for you to get some one on one time with us. What do you think?”

So I’m excited to say that Lily finally saw the light and realized that yeah, this was a great opportunity to kick her feet back, relax, and made plans for Elle to stay with her family friend.

So some of you may be upset that we didn’t take the direct route that many of you were advising, demanding that Elle couldn’t come to the weekend getaway. However, we wanted to keep things calm/courteous and Ivy did a great job managing it. It might have been indirect, but it solved two problems in one.

All in all, the cottage was even more fun than last year! It was filled with many two-fours, midnight swims, silly truth or dares questions, and too many bags of sour cream and onion chips.

tl;dr: Elle didn't come and we had a blast :)"

"UPDATE Me [30F] with my BF [30M] duration, I want to send him sexy pictures as a surprise but I don't know if I should.


Previous: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53plis/me_30f_with_my_bf_30m_duration_i_want_to_send_him/


I just want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post. This issue is such a non-issue that I can't believe how seriously you all took me. All the tips, caution, the encouragement just reminded me how wonderful everyone here can be.


Thanks to you guys and the post I made, I was reminded of all the wonderful qualities and reasons I fell in love with my boyfriend and I decided to send him some pictures. It took awhile to find one I felt comfortable with, but I did find one! I know some people think I shouldn't, but I did include my face in it because I feel like it helped show how much I trust Ben and how much I love him.


I waited until the late evening when he told me how he was getting ready for head off to bed when I messaged him with a picture and then sent ""More surprises when you get back ;)"" and I'll admit, I got a little panicky. After a few minutes, Ben sent a message back with ""Oooh very sexy! &lt;3"" and pretty much that was that (Outside of our usual goodnights and I love yous).


I'll admit it, reddit, I didn't know how to take his message back on account of having never sent a photo like this before. Was he being nice? Was this a typical response which was good? Should he have said more? Should I have said more? I didn't know how to feel other than a little disappointed, especially with how long it took me to take the photo. Alongside this, Ben sent me a message the next day telling me about how busy he'll be and then never responded back. I got upset and started feeling like I made a mistake. I spent my day off work with a mix of disappointment, regret and panic, a panic that I had made a huge mistake.


Well, that afternoon I got a knock at my door and who was there? Ben. That's who was at my door. Ben and a bunch of flowers. I wasn't expecting him for a few more days and before I could say anything he told me about how he pulled a favor with his boss (whom he's friendly with) and because the team had pretty much finished up their project he got the go ahead to head home early. Ben told me that he saw the picture and was speechless for a few minutes because he had never expected anything like that from me but knew he had to get home right away to see me. And then he said he felt like the luckiest man in the world.


We've spent every day together since and we've had a fabulous time and I've never felt better about my relationship and about myself. Ben has already asked if he'll get another picture anytime soon. I told him ""Only if you're good"" :)


tl;dr: Sent picture, discovered I now need to get a full wardrobe of sexy lingerie. I feel great!"
"Me [18F] with my BF [18M] of 8 months, he ran over and killed a small child [6M] (not at fault)


[removed]"
"My (32F) wife (30F) of 4 years is ""over-teaching"" our kids (2 and 4M). EVERYTHING is either a learning experience or an opportunity to learn a ""skill"". I feel like I'm living in a children's workbook and I can't anymore.


No, my wife is not actually a teacher.  

So our kids are to the ages where they're becoming little people and it's awesome.  Our older LOVES being a big brother, and the younger is growing by leaps and bounds.  Life is pretty damned good.  

Except we can't go out of the house without it being a completely out of control ""learning experience"" or an opportunity for ""skill building"". 

The best way to illustrate this is through examples.

The other day we're at the grocery store.  The older boy is walking, the younger is in the shopping cart.  We have like 10 or so things to buy.

And there's my wife to our older son, who we'll call John, I guess.

""John, can you count how many items are in the cart?  What line should we go in?  Do we need to wait our turn?  Is it our turn yet?  Oh look, it's our turn!  What do we do with our things?  No, we don't put them on the desk, that's not called a desk, it's called a ""checkstand"".  Can you say that word honey?  *Checkstand*  What's the person we pay called?  Can you read his name?  This thing is called a credit card, do you know how it works?""

On and on and on and ON.  Everyone in that damn line was rolling their eyes and giving me sympathetic looks.

Sometimes my wife will let the younger, ""Bill"" help or be present during chores and meal prep or things like that.  It's more of the same.  ""Bill, this is a spoon.  This is a knife.  This is called a ladel and this is what we do with it.  This is a cup.  These are noodles, we need to put them in water that's boiling, and you know water is boiling when you see bubbles, to make them soft enough to eat.  This is dish soap, it makes the dishes clean!""  HE'S TWO FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!

It's just everything is ""learned"" to death.  The other night we were out for a walk and a little kitten darted across the street.  Now, a normal parent might ask the kid what animal that was.  If he says a cat or a kitten, she'd say ""Good job"" and move on.

John said it was a cat.  My wife said ""Yes it's a cat, but it's a baby cat!  Do you know what a baby cat is called?  Is a cat a mammal or a reptile?  How do you know?  How do mammals raise their young?  Do all mammals have fur?""

I told her I was getting a headache, she could finish the walk with the kids and meet me at home.  It wasn't a lie, really.

Something similar happened at the fair too.  I'm not exaggerating when I say the kids never got to go on ONE ride and never got to eat ONE treat because they were so busy learning and ""building skills"" and I can't even deal with that phrase anymore.  It makes me want to scream.

Any time I bring it up, like ""Honey, just let them have fun.  We can talk about what they learned on the way home"" I'll get ""But this is such a great opportunity for them to build skills!  They won't remember in 2 hours!""  If I want to get them a simple, stupid toy that's just for fun, like something they can throw around or a stuffed toy or something, nope, that doesn't help them build any skills!  Or a ball is ""great for helping them build coordination skills!""

Everything, EVERYTHING in our lives in a learning experience.  It's either skill building (OAOIHFAWFIOWEHFAOAHIIOFWEAH I CAN'T ANYMORE!!!) or we/the kids never get to DO the activity because we have to learn about it.

I've talked to her.  God knows I've talked to her.  I've said it great she wants to give our kids such a head start, and make sure they have good life skills *for when they need them* but *everything* doesn't need to be a learning activity.  They can't just color random designs on paper, they have to build skills!  Then we have to go through the primary colors and learn about crayons and then do some skill building or ""enrichment"" activity.  

They can't just have fun.  They can't just PLAY.  

After the fair, I lost my shit that night.  She was getting undressed and remarked how much fun the kids had.  I am not proud to say I blew my stack.  This was after AT LEAST 100 conversations with various approaches about this, and I ended up shouting ""No, they did NOT have fun!  They didn't get to ride the Ferris wheel, they got a physics lesson.  They didn't get to eat deep fried anything, they got a nutrition lesson.  They didn't get to play games, they got a counting lesson.  They didn't get to try to win a goldfish, they got a zoology lesson.  NOTHING THE KIDS DID COULD POSSIBLY CONSIDERED FUN IN ANY UNIVERSE!!!""

And now I'm an ""apathetic"" father leaving her to ""do all the teaching"" when they're ""my kids too"".

I'm at the end of my rope.  It's not like I NEVER want them to have learning experiences.  It's not like I NEVER want them to do anything educational.  But they need to just *be fucking kids* sometimes too, and she thinks she's ""making learning fun"" when nothing is fun anymore.

And I can't listen to anymore of these buzzwords like skill building and enrichment and everything repeated 50 times to the kids or I'm going to lose my ever loving mind.

HELP ME REDDIT!!!

tl;dr My life is an elemetary school classroom, my kids never get to just have fun because they always have to learn.  Apparently that makes me a terrible father.  Wife won't even entertain my opinions on the matter, who do I do?"
"Me [27F] and my fiancé [28M]; we were being robbed at knifepoint, and he ran away and left me


This happened about eight months ago, and I’ve tried to be reasonable and put it past me but I’m really struggling. I’ve been told what he did was reasonable, makes sense, etc, but I keep coming back to that moment of total abandonment and fear when I realised he’d run. I just feel completely alone around him now.

We were walking home from a work function at a bar at around 1am. Neither of us had drunk that evening so we weren’t even slightly tipsy. Two guys across the street from us crossed over and approached us asking if we knew where such-and-such a street was. As fiancé turned around to point out where the street was, one of the guys pulled out a knife and told us to stop moving and to give him all our shit (phone, wallet, etc). I was surprised by how calm I was in the moment, and told them I needed to reach into my coat pocket to get my phone. As I was doing that, the guy pressed the knife against my ribs as warning because I guess he was worried I had a gun (even though that’s pretty unlikely in my country). When this happened, my fiancé bolted. It took me a bit to even realise he’d left me, and when I realised that he’d run I was certain I was about to get badly hurt or die.

Fortunately, the thieves seemed to get kind of spooked by him getting away and just hurried me up. They took my phone, bag (with my purse with all my money, cards, personal effects), necklace (worth like ten bucks) and legged it. The whole ordeal from start to finish took maybe five minutes.

I was kind of in shock and wandered off back up the street, heading back towards the bar, not even really thinking. A few minutes later my fiancé found me and told me he called the police, who arrived about ten minutes later.

I found out that fiancé had run about a block away, calling emergency services as he ran. We were both okay physically, except for a tiny bit of broken skin on my ribs where they’d pressed the knife.

My fiancé says what he does makes sense – that if he’d hung around and it turns out they’d wanted to hurt us or worse, we’d both be fucked because no one else would be around to call the cops or an ambulance. That he wanted to be alive and able to help in case something happened to me. He also says that by running away, the thieves didn’t want to hang around any longer than necessary (which is true), which might have saved me. His mum agrees and has praised him for not being an idiot, but my own mother has quietly told me she thinks he’s a coward for abandoning his wife-to-be (but she also has very oldschool beliefs about gender roles). Fiancé asked me not to tell our friends exactly what happened, because he says they wouldn’t understand his actions unless they were there.

My own thoughts are that, by running away, he potentially significantly decreased my chance of survival. I’m only about 157cm (5’2”) and 51kgs (110lbs). He’s 178cm (5’10”) and 75kg (165lbs). The two guys were about his size. They would have been able to easily overpower/subdue me, but my fiancé there would have made it 2v2 (although we would have still been at a disadvantage, them still having a knife and size advantage) and not left me completely at the mercy of two criminals who mug couples at night. I also wonder, what would have happened if him leaving me had given them the courage to do something worse? I mean, I don't think they would have - they seemed pretty strung out, interested in valuables and cash only - but what if?

I look at him and wonder, do I even want kids with him? If I did have a child with him, would he abandon him or her in a dangerous situation because it was the ‘smart’ thing to do?

I’ve lost a lot of attraction to him. He accuses me of wanting to use him as a meatshield just because he’s a man, and that what he did was smart and not the machismo stupidity I ‘wanted’ that could have gotten us both killed. I didn’t want him to try to fight them… I just wanted him by my side. Which I guess is selfish, because it was a dangerous situation. I don’t feel safe around him anymore, which I used to. I’m even scared of the dark again, despite him lying in bed right next to me.

As I'm typing this, I kind of feel like Lex in Jurassic Park, after being ditched by the lawyer - ""He left us! He left us!"". Stupid thing to add, but I keep thinking of that scene!

I don’t know what to think. He doesn’t want to see a counsellor because, again, he says they wouldn’t understand the situation unless they’d experienced it themselves. We fortunately don’t have a wedding date set, so there’s no immediate pressure of marriage. Please help!

tl;dr: My fiancé ran away and left me to face two muggers by myself. He says it was the smart, logical thing to do, but I can’t get over how abandoned I felt in the moment and I’ve lost a lot of regard for him."

We have been married for 5 years and together for 8.

Not really great at writing, so apologies in advance. I'll try to include as much info as I think is relevant but please feel free to ask me for more in the comments if I wasn't clear about something.

My wife has been jealous of a coworker at my job for some time now. Her name is Heather and she's in her early 20s, tall, pretty. Just observations as I have a pair of eyes. Heather is nice but I don't go out of my way to talk to her. We worked together on a project about 8 months ago, which is when this seems to have started. Heather, 3 other coworkers, and I were assigned to this project and so for a good month we spent much time together at work. My wife saw her one day when we were all coming out and she was picking me up to go to dinner at my parents. She immediately asked who she was and if she worked at my job. I told her she was new and was put on our project. For the entire duration of the project my wife was in a bad mood almost every day and would take every opportunity to tear Heather down, saying she was lanky or her nose was crooked or whatever. She is insecure about her height because she's 5'4 and not a ""6 foot tall glamazon"". I love my wife's height and her petite figure and tell her this every day. She is extremely gorgeous and turns heads whenever we walk downtown. But once she saw Heather was tall and not ugly she was convinced I thought she was hot.  I kept telling her she was just a colleague and that I had no interest in her. Regardless, she would greet her coldly or not at all if she saw my colleagues. Our home and jobs are located downtown so we usually walk to meet up with each other after work. My wife would start dressing up a lot more than usual when she'd come meet me and make a big show of jumping on me and stuff. She works at a very nice bakery and usually brings leftovers from work for us or people at my job. She always gave things out to everyone except Heather. 

Eventually Heather picked up on the hostility and approached me to ask about why my wife was acting that way. I simply told her I didn't know, maybe because she didn't know her as long as the other colleagues she was distant. She seemed to accept that but would no longer leave at the same time as everyone else and would either go early or hang back.

Bryan, another coworker, approached me on Friday and asked to talk to me privately. He told me he had been at lunch with Kate, the coworker in question, and she had gone to pay for the food. She left her phone on the table. It lit up with a text and he saw it was from Valerie, my wife's name. The text basically said ""Did you see him talking to her today? What did he say?"" then ""Do you think Heather is going to stay at that job long?"" When Kate came back to the table he asked her if that was Valerie as in my wife. She got a deer in headlights look and said ""Oh yea..we text sometimes. We're friends."" He said he thought it was weird because she put her phone in her purse without even checking the messages he had asked about and wanted to go.

I went home and I snooped on my wife's phone. I know it was wrong but I had a feeling that if I asked her she would deny it or become defensive and not show me the phone. There were weeks worth of texts that basically were little reports on what went on at work. If Heather talked to me, what we talked about, did she hug me goodbye, did she touch me at all, did I laugh at her jokes. Did the guys think she was hot, did I join in with them, did I look like I was flirting..

Kate was also apparently talking up Valerie at work to Heather. She made sure to mention often we were married, how great Valerie was, how long we'd been together. I even read one that said ""I told her 'Val works in a bakery. I bet if anyone tried to steal her husband she'd just chop them up and bake them in to a pie, haha!' "" which was pretty fucking creepy. 

A lot of things started coming together then. Heather was much more distant lately, she seemed hesitant to say bye at the end of the day. We used to talk casually like everyone else at work but now she would just say hi and bye mostly.

I've been sitting on this information all weekend. Today at work I could hardly look at Heather for shame of it, and I couldn't look at Kate for my disgust. I haven't been able to approach my wife about this because I just don't know how or what to say. I feel frustrated and very much weirded out. I feel gross too like I've had my every move watched without knowing it and as if just talking to a coworker is doing something wrong. 

I haven't talked to anyone else about this, not even Bryan who first mentioned it. I don't know what to do from here. I don't even know what this means for our relationship. It feels like something big has changed because I haven't been able to look at her the same way and all my interactions with her since Friday have been kind of forced and faked. I need to talk to her and figure out what to do.

Any advice would be appreciated. I feel very lost right now.

TL;DR: My wife has felt insecure about another coworker because they are tall and attractive. She has been texting with another coworker of mine who gives her reports on my interactions with the coworker my wife is jealous over. I feel betrayed and a bit sick thinking of it. I don't know what this means for us or how to proceed.

"I [25f] have recently been diagnosed with an medical condition, my SO [29m] of 2 years thinks I am HIV positive and is being a jerk


Basically I have recently been diagnosed (like in the past week) with an auto immune condition (am willing to PM people the name of the condition, just don’t want to say it publicly because SO knows I reddit, and I can’t imagine that this is a common situation). In the grand scheme of auto immune conditions it’s on the low end. It’s completely non-contagious and I am in the process of working with my immunologist to treat the condition via a combination of steroids and immunosuppressants. It’s not going to kill me or lower my life expectancy, it’s just a chronic thing that will flare up throughout my life. 


SO and I have been together for almost 2 years now, and up until my diagnosis it has been smooth sailing. When I got the diagnosis, my boyfriend completely freaked out and now thinks that because I have an autoimmune condition, I must be HIV positive. In the last week, I have started a huge dose of immunosuppresents to get the condition under control. Of course this means it has wreaked havoc on my immune system – something my family dr, the immunologist and pharmacist have advised me on – and I am more susceptible to certain illnesses.. Last week I developed a pretty nasty flu and had an outbreak of cold sores. SO was livid, and thinks that is a sign of HIV. He started yelling at me, accused me of cheating on him and left our home to stay with his family. 


I don’t have HIV. I have had multiple blood work and tests in the past couple of months. I’ve offered for SO to come with me to speak to my doctor. He is insisting that I must have HIV, and he is not coming home until I admit that I lied/cheated on him.


I honestly don’t know what more I can do. I am exhausted, sick and now dealing with a long term (and expensive) health condition. I don’t want to fight him, but I want him on my side.  We haven’t spoken in 2 days, but he is still texting me. What can I do to convince him I am not cheating/HIV positive?

"My [26/F] mother [67/F] wants me to deal with my ex-fiance [27/M] who still lives with her- 3+ years after the fact.


**EDIT Thank you everyone who has responded to this thread thus far. I didn't expect this post to absolutely explode with some amazing advice, some harsh realizations, and great support. I've tried to respond to everything I could, and I have read every single comment that's been made so far. You guys are amazing! I think I've gotten everything I need from this thread, but I will continue to read and comment to anything new if I can. I can't say that there will be an update, but should I find out anything of worth I'll be sure to post that in the future. **

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I don't want this associated with my main account at all. 

Fair warning: this is a VERY long story. You need to know everything there is to know to better understand how shitty this situation is for me. 

Several years ago, when I was 21, I met this ""fantastic"" British boy on an online game. He was in the process of finalizing his divorce to his then wife. I was super respectful when I found out the details of his relationship, even though it was coming to an end. It wasn't until after they were officially divorced and they had moved on that we began talking a bit more seriously about there being an ""us"". 

After several months of video chatting, texting, e-mails at work, etc, we decided to meet up. I drove to Florida to meet him, and everything felt like a fairy tale from then on. I honestly believed he was everything to me. We moved in together after we started dating, and after a few months of living together he expressed wanting to go ""home"", which meant the UK. We worked things out financially, and we zipped off to England where we lived with his parents for a year. During that time, he proposed. I was over the moon. I said yes, and then we had to have a come to Jesus talk about our situation. In the end, we moved back to The U.S. to complete his permanent residency, while living with my parents since he couldn't work at the time. 

However, during all of this I was very blind to what was actually happening. In the beginning, his ex-wife had contacted me about how he cheated on her, etc. Being the typical girl in a new relationship high I figured she was just bitter and angry, and he perpetuated that lie with stories about how she was crazy. You know, the usual. During the course of our relationship there were a few red flags that he was quick to have stories for. ""Oh this girl I'm chatting with? Old friend! We're just catching up!"" Of course, this was a lie, among -many- others that I found out about after the fact. 

The biggest lie he told me was near the end of our relationship. I had a best friend named Cynthia, who he had gotten close to. Just a few days before my birthday he told me they were heading out to the mall to buy me a gift. You know, just a few hours, and then he'd be back. He didn't come home until 5 AM, when I was waking up to get ready for work. He claimed the car broke down on their way home from the mall, and that they had to call our mutual friend Kim to jump start the engine. Well, the mall closed at 10 PM, and when I spoke to Kim about it she said she met up with them just past 11 PM to help out, and that they were very drunk and touchy-feely, and they she felt awkward the entire time and asked why I wasn't there. She said they both claimed that they had asked me to hang out, but I said no. 

Lo and behold, on my birthday, neither of them had a gift for me. At that point, it was pretty obvious that something had happened, and with previous evidence I was finally done with his bullshit. I gave him back the ring and informed my parents that our relationship was over. Keep in mind, I confided in my mother a lot. Growing up, we were very close, and I always went to her when I had an issue or was frustrated. She knew about everything, and I mean everything. 

I told my mother that I was contacting his parents, and I was arranging to buy his plane ticket back home to the UK. With my own money. As I saw it, he had cheated on me, and it was time to have him move out so we both could move on with our lives. At this time, I was 22 nearing 23. 

WRONG. My mother, and my father, decided to put their feet down and told me that I brought him back to America, so we needed to sort shit out. They also refused to let him move into the guest bedroom. For the next 6 months, I lived in Hell. He was verbally and emotionally abusive, didn't respect ANY of my boundaries. I worked 6 AM - 4 PM, and he was constantly up until 4-5 AM on Skype with new girls and gaming buddies being loud as hell, etc. The list goes on and on. It was awful, just take my word for it. On top of it all, I was constantly arguing with my parents about it. They saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with what was happening, and that we needed to be adults and work it out. 

Nothing changed until I finally had a nervous breakdown and told them that if he didn't go, I would move out and take my $500 in rent and utilities elsewhere. They promptly agreed to let him move into the guest bedroom. 

However, he refused to move into the other bedroom! For the next week and a half I had to argue with him about moving his things. I finally got sick of it and moved his shit myself when he was out on a date with Cynthia. (We weren't friends anymore at this point, obviously). 

Once he moved into the guest bedroom, things were okay. I was able to lock myself away in my room when I wasn't at work, and I really just poured myself into my job and doing art on the side for additional income. It was a shitty situation to be in, but I was trying to make it work. Unfortunately, it only got worse. It became clear that my parents were choosing his side over mine. He said a lot of nasty things about me to them, and I got to hear about them through them in a ""I can't believe you did this!"" way. My mother started leaving me nasty written letters under my door, and whenever I would confront her she would say everything she'd written was true- because my ex-fiance had told her. I reminded her that all of this ""information"" she was getting was coming from the mouth of a lying cheater, and she was going to take his word over mine, her own daughter? Well, she did. 

When I had managed to save up enough money I peaced out and moved out without a damn word to anyone. I had a friend several states away who was kind enough to let me rent out their spare bedroom, and that's what I rocked for a solid year before I met my current boyfriend and moved in with him. I'm in a happy, solid place in my life, and I'm almost 27. 

My ex-fiance still lives with my parents. In the time after we broke up until I moved out he didn't have a job, and thus didn't pay rent or anything else. However, he did complete his permanent residency and is allowed to work. After I moved out, I didn't speak to my parents unless it was absolutely required. I called on Christmas, New Year's, Mother's day, etc. I didn't give my parents an address, either. I was fine with cutting all ties with my family since it was clear they were going to support my jackass of a lazy ex-fiance. 

So, that was just over 3 years ago. Yes, he still lives with them. Over time, my relationship with my mother got a bit better, but she's never apologized for what happened. That's okay. I don't expect one from her, but I won't make her a priority in my life. 

The other day, I got a random Facebook message from my ex-fiance's mother asking me to message him because he had a question for me. I was hesitant at first, but unblocked him on Facebook. I asked what was up, and he asked me about my TV and papasan chair. When we were living with my parents I bought both of these things, and when I moved out I left them behind because I didn't have room in my car, and I refused to make a second trip out of fear of dealing with him or my family. He said since he had been using them since I left, he just wanted to ask if he could take them, since he was moving out of my parent's house and into his own place. I said I didn't care. Honestly, I wasn't going to be getting those things back, and I really did not give two shits if he took them without my permission. That was the extent of our conversation. 

A few hours later, I get an angry phone call from my mother as to ""why in the hell would I give him permission to take the TV and chair"". I said, to be honest, I didn't give a damn. I hadn't seen either of those things in over three years, and I wasn't that god damned attached to them. If he was going to use them, so what? It's not like I was getting any use out of them. So then she went on a tirade about how he hasn't been paying rent since May, that he's knocked up Cynthia but left her for another girl (surprising), his room is an episode of hoarders gone wrong, etc. Also, while my mother was in the nursing home (she has failing health) and my dad was visiting he threw a huge party my uncle came home to. My uncle comes over to make sure the house is okay while my mother is in the hospital or the nursing home when she has really bad episodes. I spoke to him and he said it was close to 40-50 people who trashed the house, etc. The list goes on and on. 

My mother then told me I had to deal with my ex-fiance, since it was originally my idea to bring him around. Apparently, she and my father had been trying to get him out for months but he either wasn't listening or said he would move out by a certain date then never would. I told her to call the police and have him forcibly removed since it's their house and if they're kicking him out they can escort him out and watch as he takes his things. She said no, that wouldn't do, and that I needed to handle this situation. 

This is when I absolutely lost it. I reminded her of all of the bullshit I had to go through with him and her, and how, in the end, both she and my father supported him and his words over me. They paid for everything he needed such as close and cigarettes (and those aren't cheap!), catered to every need, yet if I was a day late on my rent (because I was waiting for payday) all hell would break loose. I reminded her that he had cheated on me, and when I made it clear our relationship was over they refused to let him move out of the house, much less my room until I finally snapped and threatened to move out. I reminded her every letter she slipped under my door, of every nasty insult she flung my way because he had lied to her, etc. I said no, she made her decision when she chose him over me, and she needed to stick to her guns and get him out of the house if that's what she truly wanted now.

It sucked getting that rude with my mother, but she had to know where I stood and the position she was trying to place me in. However, it's not as easy as that. My mother is very sick. She is constantly in and out of the hospital with heart/lung issues. She lives on an oxygen tank now, and any amount of stress can trigger a whole slew of issues. Her doctor's have warned her multiple times that stress can give her a stroke, etc. I've already lost my grandmother to a stroke, so I don't want my mother to go the same way. A part of me feels responsible for the situation, since I don't want my mother to have to put up with him. 

After my conversation with my mother, I sent my ex-fiance another message. I told him that after speaking to my mother I wasn't comfortable with him taking anything, including the TV or chair. I said those things were to remain where they are, and he is not allowed to take them. I said this was my first and last message to him regarding the issue, and to resolve this as peacefully as possible with my parents. They deserve that much. To be safe, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my mother, as well. I then blocked him on Facebook again. 

So, my question is, did I handle this the right way? I feel incredibly bad that I don't want to do anything more for my parents, but at the same time I also feel that they made their bed and have to lie in it now. If anyone else has gone through something similar, what would you do? Should I call the police for them? Should I make a visit? I'm at a loss since I feel like I've done enough, but not ""enough"", if that makes any sense whatsoever. :/ Any help or advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much. 

TL;DR: Met a guy when I younger, got engaged and moved in with my parents. After he clearly cheated on me they picked his side over mine, my life was hell. I moved away and he still lives with them over 3 years later, and now my mom's expecting me to deal with him since they're trying to kick him out.

So as title states my moron brother shot a arrow through his sons arm. I don't care if it was an accident it was moronic to do what he did. He told his son to go pick something up near the target and he did. He decided this was a good time to shoot an arrow and it hit his son on the arm. 

His wife and daughters [40F, 16F, 14F,10F] refuse to believe this was an accident. His wife divorced him and nothing could change her mind about it.  They think even if it was a mistake, it's unforgivable to shoot an bow and arrow around a child when he is near the target. My nieces have become super protective of my nephew since that day. Their mother tells me they play with him all the time. 

My brother keeps pressuring me to get his daughters and ex wife to speak to him. It's getting to the point where he calls me in the middle of the night to make it happen. How do I get him to stop?

"My [31F] Husband [33M] of 4 years doesn't take our roleplaying serious when we have sex! He purposely takes his characters way over the top!


So we've been with eachother for 6 years. Our sex life is just as good as when it started, I just wanted to try out some kinkier stuff so I suggested roleplaying. Kevin (husband) was somewhat open to the idea, but also thought it was a bit ridiculous. This is something I've always wanted to try, sort of like a fetish. So we got a few costumes, a Cop outfit and a Spy trenchcoat for him, and a nurse and cheerleader outfit for me. All of our roleplaying revolves around one person being in character, and the other interacting with them.

But he takes his roles as a joke! He goes intentionally extreme with the roles. I know he thinks it's a bit ridiculous, and I know he has more fun when he does this, but I want a real roleplay!

For example, when he dressed up as the Cop, he was supposed to do a stop and frisk, arrest me, etc, but in a sexy way. But instead, he kicks open the door, screams ""HANDS UP THIS IS A RAID"" and basically tackles me to the bed (this is OKAY it's NOT ABUSE we have rough dom/sub sex all the time), handcuffs me, literally reads me my Miranda Rights, leaves me there and rummages through the drawers throwing stuff everywhere, pulls out a little baggy of weed and goes apeshit like a cop might. I play a long, try to get him to 'let me go' if I can do sexual favours for him. Then we have some rough sex with handcuffs and everything. The actual sex was good but he kept speaking into his fake radio calling for backup, when I was on top he would shout OFFICER DOWN OFFICER DOWN.

With the Spy outfit he would come in and check me for wires and do the whole Pink Panther thing where he says ""It is lovely weather we are having"" while sneaking to the drapes and then beating the drapes up. I was envisioning a more James Bond-eqsue seduction.

Like, I like the sex, it's good, but I wanted a more porn-like experience. And it was kinda funny but not what I thought. And I KNOW that he thinks roleplay is ridiculous, and that he is trying to have fun with it but I feel like he doesn't know what I want. And I don't hate him for it, he's a big fuckin goofball in or out of our roles, but I want to have MY experience. How can I tell him this?

Edit: Well this got pretty popular! I appreciate all the advice and that y'all think my husband is funny. He IS funny, which is why I'm not totally cheesed over the situation. I'll try explaining to him more clearly what I want and then we can try to compromise. I don't think he's compensating or nervous, I think he's just trying to enjoy it the only way he knows how.

"[UPDATE] Me [23M] with my Girlfriend [22F] of 6 years. She cheated on me.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52f0hf/me_23m_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_6_years_she/)


turns out that she lied to my face when I gave her the opportunity to tell me the truth. It was not that one drunk mistake as she tried to make me believe. She fucked the guy five times over the three day trip. The sister of one of my best friends was with her on the trip and he knew all the time but did not say anything as he wanted to give her the opportunity to tell me the truth. 


I confronted her and she confessed. She said that she lied to me to save our relationship. I think that shows how mentally fucked up you have to be in that kind of situation. As if lying would safe a relationship... 


Afterwards I completely passed out for the first time in my life. Probably because my mind could not handle it. Luckily, I had a friend who took care of me. 


I still cannot believe how a human you think you know better than yourself can change that drastically over such a short period of time. Something like that can really fuck with your worldview. I started to question everything but I hope that I will be able to fix this in the future. Time will tell.


I'm definitely done with this shit. I actually thought that there might be a chance to make this work again but now I know that this is not going to happen. I cut all contact.

"My [17f] loser older brother [26m] flushed our step-brother's [12m] fish down the toilet on purpose. My parents are acting like it isn't a big deal and I'm ANGRY about it.


My oldest brother....we'll call him Dick has always been a spoiled jerk but he's worst to our little brother Duvall because he's jealous of him. Duvall is sweet and smart so everyone has always liked him better. Duvall is our step-mom's kid but he's been our brother since he was five. 


Duvall is really shy and his best friend is his pet fish Marco. His Instagram is just pictures of Marco and us. Our rooms share a wall and I hear him talking to Marco sometimes. 


My parents pretty much let Dick get his way all the time because of his temper. He's immature and rude. It's so stupid I think they should just kick him out so we could have some peace for once. 


The other day when I was at soccer practice Dick's laptop wasn't working and he wanted to use Duvall's. Duvall was working on a school project so he ran in our dad's office and locked it so Dick couldn't take it. Dick went upstairs and flushed Marco. Then he went downstairs and told Duvall through the door what he did. Duvall ran to see if Dick was telling the truth and Dick took his laptop. 


I screamed at Dick when I got home and found out and he just laughed at me. Duvall was making himself sick he was crying so hard. He kept asking me if Marco suffered and if I thought he was scared when he died and if he hated Duvall for not taking care of him. I called my parents but both their secretaries said they were busy. Dick wouldn't stop making fun of Duvall for crying so I called Dick's girlfriend and told her about all the girls Dick's been talking to so he'd have to go to her place to convince her not to break up again. Whatever he said didn't work, she kicked him out in time to be home for dinner. 


When I told my parents what Dick had done my mom yelled ""Goddamn it (Dick), you're buying him another one!"" and then left the room to get changed for dinner. Then my dad yelled ""And leave his computer alone!"" That was it. That's his punishment. Dick told on me about ratting him out to his girlfriend but my parents hate her and didn't care so I didn't get in trouble either. 


I was really angry about their non reaction and fought with my parents during dinner until my Dad told me to shut up. He said not everything has to be a big deal, it was just a fish, and I'm just being a seventeen year old drama queen. 


Dad gave Duvall his ""brave little soldier"" speech which is dad speak for ""shut up, I don't want to hear about it anymore"". Duvall is putting on a brave face but he has cried himself to sleep every night since and it makes me cry hearing him. I hate Dick and think about setting his room on fire (I won't) a LOT. 


I'm really mad and wish I could call the cops on Dick. This isn't fair and I don't know how to make it better. Duvall doesn't want another fish. 


tl;dr: I'm upset my parents aren't taking my older brother flushing our little brother's pet down the toilet seriously. Dad told me I'm being a drama queen and it isn't my business but he's the one who told me looking out for my brother is my business in the first place! How do I get them to understand how cruel my older brother is? "
"My [42 M] wife [39 F] ""refuses to be my emotional cheerleader."" But yet...


Years ago, at the very beginning of the relationship, she told me that she refused to be my emotional cheerleader. When I would try to open up to her, share my fears or concerns, she would reinforce her stance in no uncertain terms. Negative reinforcement. Anger, frustration, name calling -- calling me a stunted teenager, an emotional cripple. Over a short time, I learned my lesson. If I have something troubling me, keep it inside. 

I found a therapist for several key issues over the years; got treatment for my own depression. Cool. Getting my head straight is always a good idea. But the marriage has suffered.

Now, she says she can never trust me because I'm not emotionally honest with her. In therapy, she mentioned this lack of trust and my lack of openness as a problem in our relationship. I looked at her, reminded her of the way she trained me at the beginning of the relationship, and she smiled and deflected. ""I never told you that..."" Laughed it off right in front of the therapist. Boy, I caught hell for that later that evening.

Why am I sharing this? I've started thinking that my wife may be a narcissist. I'm not sure. Half the time she has me thinking that I'm a narcissist! Odd how every time I bring up something about the relationship that troubles me, it always gets twisted around and ends up being my fault. I don't often bring up my issues.

As a disclaimer, I've always been faithful, a solid and consistent provider, a present and hands-on father. Working from home most days, I do most of the cooking, child-rearing, and cleaning, working after the children are put to bed most nights. She almost certainly has anxiety and depression issues, but refuses treatment. Nothing is her fault. Her perception of reality is correct. Mine is not.

Well a lot has happened since I made my first post. I guess I'll address it sequentially, since that's how I'm operating right now, moment to moment.

After I made that post, I decided to truly cut him off. I changed the wifi password, froze the credit card I gave him, applied to close our joint accounts, and threw out any gifts I ever gave him. We were planning on attending a dork convention over Labor Day (in Atlanta, for those familiar with the con scene) that I had budgeted paying for both of us over a year ago. I told him he couldn't go unless he paid for his half of the hotel and tickets, $600. Not sure why I did this instead of shooting straight and admitting he was out of his gourd if he thought he could go... shouldn't have played any games but I'm kinda glad I did because he told me he'd have $1000 to me by the end of August. Over text too, in writing.

I was floored. Suddenly he can come up with money for a weekend of partying and a chance to reel me back in? I said I would apply that to August's bills, then he could start paying down the rest of the ~$25k he owed me for supporting him this past year before he could spend his money on luxuries like out of state vacations. This was over text, and he never responded, and slept on the couch again that night.

That was a Friday. Saturday morning, he left the house around 9am with his dog, leaving all of his crap in my house. I piled all of his and his dog's stuff under his desk and got rid of any pictures of him around the house. I blocked him everywhere but Facebook and text. I went to two rental house showings, loved one of them and the landlord, put a deposit down that day, went on multiple walks with my dog as well as a long trip to the dog park, and celebrated/vented/drank wine through Twizzlers with my next door neighbour and her boyfriend. Ex-BF never returned that night.

Sunday, I spent the day working on cosplays and outfits for the convention as well as goofing off with my neighbour and dog. It was lovely. I kept waiting for this wave of sadness and regret to hit me, but it never did. He had been out for 24 hours and his name wasn't on the lease - I texted him that his claim to residency was gone, and he needed to come get his things with 24 hours notice. He said he was coming that night. I said 24 hours notice. He agreed to Monday evening.

Monday, he picks up his stuff in his father's truck and gives me back the key. Hours after he left, he added a song to our shared YouTube playlist - ""Say Something"" by A Great Big World. I added ""Gravity"" by Sara Bareilles and ""Too Good"" by Drake, then removed his access to the playlist the next morning. Yay middle school communication methods.

Wednesday his best friend texts me like nothing is wrong. Thursday, I text my ex about when I can expect his check in the mail. He doesn't respond. Friday morning, I email him. At this point, as far as I can tell, he's gone no contact with me. I send him one last email a day later basically stating that, and he asks me to coffee Sunday night.

We met up for coffee. He never mentions repayment at all but in the discussion about our feelings, we both felt the same way about this: betrayed, abandoned, hurt, and distrustful of the other person. He felt I had lied when I said I was fine supporting him and basically insinuated that I wouldn't want to be repaid if I believed in us because otherwise I was actually loaning him money under the guise of love and setting him up to fail. When I realized he felt just as used as me because I cut him off from my money, I knew I was done. My stomach sank like a weight. I let him finish talking, then we parted ways. He asked if he could contact me, I said I needed a break.

The next day I emailed him about the $1000 he promised me and reminded him he never discussed repayment at our meeting. He didn't respond for days, then the day I was set to leave town for the convention, he replies saying the money was on the way. Cool, it can sit in my mailbox for 5 days while I'm out of state. Also, during this time he was telling mutual friends we were ""going through a rough patch"" yet my friends were finding him on Tinder and OKC.

I partied my tail off for the entire convention and when I came back, the check was in an un-postmarked envelope in my mailbox. I cashed it and sent him an email telling him such and asked that he use snail mail for future repayments instead of trespassing on my property when he knows I won't be home. I seriously wonder if he was looking for the spare key I left with the dog sitter... so creepy.

He replied to that email with some mushy ""I love you and I know I fucked up"" things claiming he is too nice and can't say no and his urge to help others makes him neglect himself and he needs to work on that. It was the most laughable apology on earth. ""I was so nice and helpful that I couldn't stop myself from draining you of all your money and energy! My bad.""

I replied ""You broke my heart and my bank account. It will be a long time before they're both fixed, and my then I hope I won't be stupid enough to trust you with them a third time. I will be responding to emails about repayment, otherwise good luck with everything.""

He replied, ""If I could take everything back that I did, I would. I love you (name). With all my heart. I could have prevented it all. I could have taken action. But I let you slip away. And that'll be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I'm truly truly sorry for hurting you. I just want you to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted.""

I moved out of the house we lived in to a similar one a few streets away. Moving helped keep me busy enough to not think about this. I threw out all our mementos and pictures and shit in the process so everything in the new place is all me. Just me.
Now I'm settled in and it feels like it hasn't hit me that it's over. I thought I would be crushed, and there were some lonely moments at the convention that caught me up enough to need a cigarette, but I just feel humiliated. I don't even have the urge to check his Instagram, every time I see a picture of him it just reminds me of how stupid and naive I am for thinking he was my One. I'm also super distrustful of my feelings now because of that... it wasn't a question in my mind when I met him that we'd be together forever. I knew I wanted to spend my life with him, like my name, like a fact. I see cute people out or have great conversations but I have no desire for anything more because I feel like my feelings aren't trustworthy enough to merit acting on them. They led me so far astray last time...

But that's it I guess. It's over and life is going on.

"[Update] My [28f] fiance's [31m] fetish is growing out of control. We talked it through, and made some decisions.


[removed]"
"My [44F] daughter [14F] broke her ankle on the way home yesterday. My son [13M] carried her home on his back and my son [20M] is angry he did not call 911


This is so ridiculous but I have almost had enough of my son. I have enough going on with work, without having to listen to him moan. I could use some advice. 

My daughter just started high school as a freshmen and my son Cody is in his last year of middle school. There schools are near each other and there is a mall not to far away. My son went to the mall after school to buy himself something and he ran into my daughter. They decided to walk home together so he hung out with her and her friends. 

They were walking home and there is this short cut through the park you can take. However there is this hill that can be difficult to make your way down sometimes. You're cutting through the garden so there is rocks, branches and plants. My daughter tripped and she started to cry. 

My son told her not to worry and he picked her up and carried her home. I am a paramedic so I could tell right away her ankle was more than likely broken. I took her to the hospital and everything was sorted out. My daughters [19F,21F] go to college but live in a city near us. They drive down every second weekend to visit. 

They and I told my son Cody (13M) that we are proud of him. My son Finn (20M0 on the other hand is mad because he did not call 911 and how in his mind she was in longer pain that necessary. After a long argument my daughters and I just ignored him. 

My son and daughters are ignoring Finn attitude. Finn keeps messaging me about it, he keeps tweeting about it, he made a Facebook post about it, he keeps calling. I know it's easy to ignore him, but how can I get him to stop embarrassing himself?

tl;dr: son is angry other son did not call 911 for sisters broken ankle "
"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] of one year has been told she's just the funny one her entire life and made to feel as though she isn't as pretty as her older sister.


This is primarily her aunts' and mother's doing. Pretty much every female relative she has, as well as some female friends from when she was in high school, have very openly praised her sister's looks and told her she's ugly compared to her sister. 

Her sister doesn't say anything when this happens. She doesn't agree or disagree. But silence speaks volumes IMO. 

So I met my gf a couple of years ago at a work related gig. We became friends, and a year later we started dating. While we were friends, I'll admit I had a huge crush on her. Not only was she smart, hilarious and the life of the party. She was (and still is) very beautiful. When she said yes to going out with me, I was the happiest guy in the world. And I've been happy with her everyday since. 

The thing is, I recently met her family, as in her immediate and extended family, and it was a very strange experience for two reasons:

1. She prepped me on all her family members, but the one thing she kept saying about her sister was ""she's really pretty"" as if giving me a heads up? Weird. 

2. One of her aunts joked that they were shocked my gf found a solid boyfriend before her sister did, implying her sister is prettier and should therefore have less trouble finding a guy. Also weird. 

On the way home, I asked my girlfriend about what was said, and she then told me ""Oh, it's normal. She's the pretty one. I'm the funny one."" Worried that it would come off corny and white knight-ish, I held back for a second but I eventually told her, ""You do realize you're funny *and* beautiful, right?"" 

She playfully rolled her eyes at that and we didn't speak of what happened the rest of the night. 

I figured maybe that's the way she and her family rib each other. Every family has their own weird way of expressing love. Mine is a little weird like that, too. 

Then I hung out with her family again and it was the same shit. Except this time one of her aunt's asked me to stand beside her sister for a second, after which she said, ""Wow, *they* look like a couple."" 

What the fuck.

Everyone laughed. Everyone except for me and my gf's dad. He didn't seem amused, and I guess he could tell I wasn't amused either. He pulled me aside later and told me his wife and sisters/sister-in-laws are crazy when it comes to looks. They have a fucked up sense of humour, don't take it personally, etc. 

A few days later I asked my girlfriend if it makes her uncomfortable when her family goes after her looks like that, and she said she's used to it. Basically it does make her uncomfortable but it's been a constant for so long, she doesn't feel she can stand up for herself. 

That's when she opened up to me about her girlfriends in high school all saying the same shit. They would always call her sister pretty but never call *her* pretty and always look at her like, ""What happened to you?""

She eventually accepted that she was just ""the funny one"" and decided to own it. 

That's great and all, but she's more than just funny, and it quite honestly pisses me the fuck off to know she's been made to feel less than for basically her entire life. Fuck that noise.

I really want to say something the next time her aunts talk shit, but she told me to just leave it alone. It also really pisses me off that her sister doesn't stand up for her. What the fuck is that about? 

Oh and my gf later told me an ex of hers once asked why she doesn't look more like her sister during a fight. 

I ended up asking her if she thinks she's pretty and she just shrugged passively. To be honest I'm shocked. She's hot, you guys. Beautiful, hot, pretty, all the words. And she's hilarious. 

This whole situation makes my blood boil. 

Am I overreacting or is this really fucked up? 

TL;DR My girlfriend's female relatives all make her feel as though she's just ""the funny one"" and nowhere near as pretty as her sister. This has been going on her entire life. She doesn't find herself pretty. An ex once used this against her in a fight. The next time her aunt's say something rude, I want to stand up for her but she told me to let it go. Should I? 

Update: She went to her parents' house to wish her mother a happy birthday this afternoon (I couldn't go because I had to work) and she came home with zero energy. I asked her what happened and at first she didn't want to say, but she eventually told me her mother and sister took it upon themselves to tell her to hold on to me tight because I'm already way out of her league. It wasn't said in a playful, joking way like, ""damn, your SO is a keeper!"" It was said to hurt her and it did. I am sure they said more on top of that. She went into the bathroom and cried. The door was locked so I gave her space. When she finally came out she very seriously asked me, ""What do you see in me?"" 

I'm about two seconds away from going off on them. 

I really don't think humour will work on these people. Seeing her so upset, I think it might benefit her to either (1) go no contact for a while or (2) sit back and let me handle it. 

I'm actually in shock that her own family is responsible for making her feel this way. And as a guy, I can safely say she is easily the most interesting, beautiful person in any room on any day. At this point I feel like maybe her female relatives are jealous that she has so many things going for her and doesn't feel the need to obsess over the state of her makeup at all times. "
"Our [14M&amp;16F] sister [22F] keeps getting skinnier and skinnier. She looks like a walking skeleton and no one is listening to us that this is bad.


Hi this is Brit talking and my brother max is with me. Our sister Jade is beyond skinny, like it's actually getting to the point where you can see almost all of her bones properly. She's not normal weight like you or I. Type in anorexic on google and she looks so close to some of the pictures that come up. 

We have spoken to her about this and she's told us to shut up, we're only kids what do we know. She is so tiny. my brother max has more meat on his bones than she does. Our parents and friends think this is OK and tell her she looks beautiful. Brutally honest she did, she did look beautiful but something happened and she dropped a massive ton of weight. She looks so frail 

We both feel like we are losing our minds because we are trying to tell people that this is a problem. Is there anything we can do?

"My [21F] fiance's [23/M] father [48?M] married his mistress after tearing apart the family - Now she wants to be invited to our wedding


My fiance's father cheated on his mother several years ago with this woman, ""Sarah"". They recently got married - like a few weeks ago, recently. She's a stone cold bitch to me. Physically turns her body at dinner tables so she doesn't have to look at me, talks down to me, always exclaims ""Oh I went there!"" any time I mention where I go to college as if I haven't mentioned it a hundred times. They also drink like there's no tomorrow - everything they do involves going to a bar and drinking more than even I would dare to attempt.

She has two young daughters of her own, and my fiance's father and her dote on them all the time. Mind you, my fiance is one of 3 siblings, and his father never thinks to try and include them. My fiance hasn't received a birthday gift in 2 or 3 years (it's not about the gift, but a card would've been nice). 

Any time we talk about wedding plans in front of his father and his wife, they always talk about how much fun they're going to have, how much they can't wait for the open bar, etc. I can already tell it will be all about them, like it always is. And for once in my life, I want something to actually be about me. I want to enjoy this day. I am afraid that I am biased because my abusive father cheated on my mom and then married his mistress too - whose name is also ""Sarah"". Keep in mind that my scorned mother will also be at this wedding - and this woman looks very similar to my father's mistress. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting this woman at our wedding? Or am I just going to have to get over it and invite her and try to steer clear of her? 
  
 TL;DR: My fiance's father and his wife are both cheating scumbags who just want to party and get drunk; I don't want them (or at least her) at our wedding. Am I being unreasonable?"
"Me [32M] with my wife [30F] of 4 years. She's a crappy friend.


Throwaway because my wife knows my main account and I'm trying to tread lightly. Married 4 years, together over 6. No kids.

My wife is a bad friend. Not to me. She's good to me. But she's a terrible friend to her friends. It's coming back to bite her now and I don't know what to say to her.

For context, my wife has had the same friend group for many years. There are about 6 of them total and they all live in our metro area and they make plans often. My wife blows them off constantly. She doesn't want to listen to them vent or complain on the phone. From what I've observed, she doesn't want to 'give' anything for her part in the friendship.

Some examples from the last couple months (there are many, many more going back years, but these are fresh):

We made reservations at a trendy (and hard to get in to) restaurant with one of her friends and the friend's husband. Friends arrange child care for their kids. The afternoon of the reservation, my wife cancels on them because she ""doesn't feel like eating anything on the menu."" This had been planned for weeks. 

Another friend breaks up with her longtime BF and calls my wife for a shoulder to cry on. My wife doesn't answer the call, saying ""I can't listen to Jane and her drama right now."" Calls many more times. Wife texts back that she can't talk right now.

Friends throw a baby shower for one of them. Wife skips it. Says she doesn't feel like going.

Friend hosts memorial dinner for her dead brother (whom my wife had known since high school). Wife doesn't go (I was going to go with her). Says she ""doesn't feel well.""

These are literally all from the past 3 months, and there are other ones I'm not listing. Personally, I don't care. They're her friends. She doesn't do this with my friends, but my group is more spread around the country so visits are rare. If she wants to be a shitty friend, then I'm not going to get in the middle of it.

But now chickens have come home to roost.

My wife recently suffered a great personal loss - her mom died unexpectedly. I've been there for her, but I'm just one person. Her sister is going through the same grief and is not a great source of support right now. She's reached out to her friends, but it seems they've noticed my wife's treatment of them. She texted one, the same one who wanted a shoulder to cry on about her BF, and the friend responded with, ""that sucks"" and nothing more. Wife wanted to get together with another (also from high school) to go through the mom's things and the friend said she couldn't anytime soon because she couldn't get a sitter. 

She's getting blown off in her time of need. I feel terrible for her, but I'm also not surprised. 

Wife is despairing (even more) because her friends aren't being there for her. So adding onto her grief is the idea that she ""has no friends.""

I have no idea what to say. Telling her to take this as a sign to be a better friend in the future seems crass. Agreeing that her friends are shitty will just make the divide even greater and then she will have no friends.

What should I tell her?

"My [20F] boyfriend [23M] announced my mental condition to a party full of people against my will, should I leave him?


I have a well controlled mental condition that I am very private about. I take two separate medications twice a day (every 12 hours) and for the most part it does not affect my daily life. Luckily I have a fantastic doctor who worked with me to experiment with medications until I found a combination that worked for me with minimal side effects. I'm just saying this to demonstrate that this is not a significant issue in my life anymore and it is not necessary for many people to know.


I started dating my boyfriend almost a year ago and he has been great, just a little dopey. He is not a subtle person and can't keep a secret to save his life. So even though I told him before we started dating that I have this condition that is well controlled and I don't really like people to know about it, he went ahead and told his parents. I was pissed but told him not to tell anyone else and we got through it. 


Well last weekend we went to a friend his' party and while they all got drunk, I sipped on a soda. Many of his friends were concerned that I wasn't drinking and kept saying stuff like: ""it's ok that you're underage. You can still have a beer. Want me to make you a cocktail?"" I was starting to become uncomfortable with the comments when my boyfriend, in his infinite wisdom, decides to announce: ""Oh she's not drinking because it affects her medication."" Okay..well now I'm pretty pissed but whatever, no one really mentioned it further. 


Well then a little but later my alarm goes off and my boyfriend, who is drunk by now, literally yells to me: ""Hey babe, it's time to take your crazy pills."" He turns to the other people and goes, ""yeah she has (condition) and has to take pills for it.""  I just stared at him. 

I could not believe that he would do this to me. I just met some of these people and now they all know something incredibly personal about me that is nobody's damn business! I hate, I *hate* the way people treat me after they find out. Like I'm unhinged or damaged or something. I don't want anybody's pity. Its fucking well controlled for christs sake! 

I grabbed his keys and went to the car, and he followed me, asking what was wrong. I didn't say anything, just drove us home and I haven't really talked to him since even though he's been apologizing profusely. Is this something I can even forgive him for? Should I? What should I do here? Seriously I'm so upset and angry. He had no right.

"I [24F] took my [50sM] CEO a coffee after hours and am now being told it was inappropriate.



Edit:

Just to clarify:

- CEO's door was not closed, it was open, but I knocked because his back was turned to his computer and I didn't want to barge in there
- CEO's office is on the second floor, I'm on the sixth. No, i don't directly pass by his office when going up but I saw 
the light was still on in the office so I went to give it to him 
- this was the first time I had ever given him something or ""ass kissed"" or whatever. Usually we just say hi and pass by each other 
- my friend is upper management, but in a different department -- he has asked me out on numerous occasions 
- I guess it's weird to people that my CEO is friendly to me? He's just a genuinely nice guy and although I'm sure he doesn't know everybody by name, he's super approachable and has an open door policy (email or drop by anytime to talk about whatever) 
- we didn't even small talk... The conversation went something like, ""Hi, how are you, I was bringing someone else a coffee and had an extra, thought you might want it. Have a nice night"" 
- I understand both sides, my ""innocent and naive"" one and the one from the other side of the desk. Hopefully it doesn't come back to bite me in the ass :) 

Thanks for all the insight everybody! 


----

I work at a company with about 1,000 employees and I'm not anybody important (lower level staff). However, the CEO does know me by name and often makes a point to say hi or hello to me whenever we run into each other. 

Work ends at 5. I had some errands to run nearby work so I was in the area until about 7. My friend texted me complaining that he was still at work, so I stopped by Starbucks to drop some off to him. We also have security staff that work overnight (24HR facility) so I figured it would be nice to bring them some coffee as well. I wasn't sure how many security people were on staff so I bought an extra coffee. On the way up, I noticed our CEO was still in the office, so I knocked, said hello, and we chatted briefly. I told him I had an extra coffee and gave it to him, not thinking much of it. 

I told my friend about the encounter and he's telling me that it was wildly inappropriate of me to do. Was what I did ok???? I'm super paranoid and panicking about it now. 

TL;DR: dropped off a coffee to my boss after hours, now I'm worried that I stepped out of line. "

"I [23,F] lied to my boyfriend [25,M] about something embarrassing and now he's thinking about leaving- nsfw


I've been dating ""John"" for a little over a year. long story short, I've never had an orgasm. Ever. I've had multiple partners, tried all sorts of things, read online looking for something to help, but it just never happened for me. I'm honestly very insecure about it- I've never told anyone before, not even my doctor, because i'm really insecure about it. I feel like if my partner knew, then sex just wouldn't be entertaining since he'd be the only one.. ya know.. so I've faked it since I was 16. about 6 months ago, John had asked me if I had faked one, so i said yes, apologized, and then up-ed my faking game since I wasn't ready to tell him. 

Fast forward to last night, I told him. I really do see a future with this guy, and for once I felt like I could tell someone. So I did, and I explained how I was too embarrassed to tell anyone before, and I was still embarrassed to say it out loud, but that I wanted him to know. 

He's now thinking about leaving me. He says that I lied to him (which is true) and that who knows what else I'm hiding (nothing at all). I tried to explain to him that I was sorry for lying, I never thought in a million years I would ever tell someone, but that I trusted him and saw a future with him. He said he needs to think about all this and re-think what kind of relationship he's in.. I don't know what to do. I understand it was wrong to lie in the first place, but I didn't think it would ever come to this, and it's especially not the way I wanted this talk to go when admitting it to someone for the fist time. Any advice?

TL;DR! I admitted to my bf that I've never had an orgasm, he said that he needs to re-think things since I lied.

*EDIT* My inbox is flooded with some advice and some real crappy comments, so I think I should give a little update. To the ones that think I deserve to get dumped and think I'm terrible- I'm sorry you feel that way. I've admitted in my post that yes, I lied, and it was wrong- I was more so looking for advice on moving forward- not to be shamed.. I think some of you need a little insight to what it's like in my shoes- I've always felt pressured to climax, there are plenty of times that I haven't faked it with past boyfriends, and the reaction has always been the same: They tell me somethings wrong with me, or that I'm doing something wrong, and they always get disappointed when it doesn't happen all the way back to when I was 16 and had sex for the first time. I felt terrible, and that I wasn't good enough or that something really was wrong with me. I'm sure to a lot of you, it doesn't seem like something to be embarrassed about, but I was/am. I'm ashamed of it. It's the only big thing in my life that I am truly embarrassed about- so no, it wasn't easy to say, and had I known this was the guy I wanted to spend my life with, I probably would have thought about saying something sooner, but I never felt comfortable sharing that with anyone. I will absolutely support my boyfriend in whatever he wants to do, the ball is in his court now, but to accuse me of lying of other things when I've never so much as said a white lie to him before this, I think is wrong given the circumstances, and If that's how he feels, then I don't think I'm with the right person either. For the few that sent supporting messages and/or actual advice on how to move forward or make things better- thank you."

"My [26f] husband [29m] found his dream home and wants to make an offer immediately. I hate it. We've been married 2 years.


We've been discussing purchasing a home recently. I told my husband ""Drew"" the only thing I care about in a home is an open floor plan because I spend so much time stuck in the kitchen when we have company over or he's in the living room before and after dinner. I want to be where everyone else is, not shouting through a doorway. 



Drew found a house that checks off everything on his wishlist... at the expense of mine. The kitchen is in the *basement*. So not only would I have to haul everything up and down stairs but I won't even get a picture window! The house is our max budget, there's no money to renovate it (the kitchen isn't the only reno we'd want either so it wouldn't even be a priority) so I'd be stuck there for a long while. 


He argues we can eat in the kitchen and he'll help me bring everything up to the dining room for company. I really don't think he appreciates how much time in the kitchen I spend and how goddamn lonely I will feel down there. When I try to explain it to Drew he just says he'll spend more time in the kitchen. I'm sure he will for a few months but we're talking about living here for *years*. 


I want to keep looking and he wants to make a offer immediately. Things have been getting really heated lately. He thinks we're going to miss out on his perfect house because I'm being pessimistic and I'm too fixated on my kitchen. 


Maybe I am but I spend most of my time there when I'm home so it's pretty important to me that it's not in a freaking dungeon. 


tl;dr: I want to keep house hunting even though my husband found his dream home. He thinks I'm being negative and self-centered. Is there a compromise that will make us both happy? "

"My [26M] best friend's [26M] fiancee [25F] confessed she's in love with me


Just some surreal shit, I can't believe this is happening.

So my best friend and his fiancee have been together for close to fours years, and engaged for close to a year now. They've been planning their wedding for a few weeks now and are planning to marry next spring. I've known my best friend since my freshmen year of high school, we went to the same college and live in the same city and are basically brothers. His fiancee I'm also good friends with, and to make it clear, I've NEVER made any sort of move on her, nor have I ever thought of her as anything but a friend. I've also never felt that SHE thought of me in this way, so this entire situation is completely out of left field. Then again, I'm really bad on picking up on cues so maybe this is just me. 

Anyways, yesterday she texted me and asked if she could come over to my place and have a serious conversation. She came over, and we were just making small talk until she became quiet and then said in a small voice that she was in love with me. I just sat there in shock, and thought maybe she was just fucking with me or some shit, and asked if she was 100% serious. She said she was, and that she had felt this way for almost two years. She continued saying that we perfect for one another and that she wanted to break up with my best friend and get together with me. 

I stood there in complete shock, I didn't know what to say. It was one of the few times in my life where I was at a complete loss for words. Then, she sat closer to me and tried to lean in, but I backed away and told her to leave and give me some space. She said to please keep this quiet and not to tell my best friend, and left after that. She's called and texted me a few times, telling me that she wanted to meet up and talk and finish our conversation. I haven't responded. 

So I honestly don't know what to do now. Should I tell my best friend? I don't know, maybe he won't believe and she'll make up some bullshit to put the blame on me instead. Who knows what she's capable of? Fuck I honestly don't know how to proceed, any advice?
  
  
tl;dr: Best friend's confessed she's in love with me and wants to get together, any advice on how to move forward?"

"Me [30M] with my wife [32F] of 6 years. I think she may be sleeping with one of her students and I do not know what to do.


My wife and I have had a rocky relationship, but in general things have been ok recently. I once drunkenly yelled at her, and she has hit me a couple times when she has been drinking, but beyond that. everything is ok. Sex is fantastic and we make each other laugh a lot. She is a professor at a community college, and I am a personal trainer. 

Over the past few weeks she has been very jealous of me and my time and that worries me. Countless times I have seen on this sub, when people get jealous, it is usually to make up for their own insecurities. Obviously this put me on edge.  

She was out for a run, and I couldn't help myself. I looked at her laptop. That on itself is not a huge deal. We share electronics all the time, but I went into her Facebook page and found something odd.  

She has a very long chat history with one of her students with strange conversations. They talk in what seems like strange coded innuendo. An example is, ""You graded my paper very harshly. I am not sure if I have the will power to write anymore this week."" To which my wife replies, ""It was not easy to grade. (: I guess I have to get used to your writing style.""  

This kind of crap goes on for the last few months. I never contacted any of my professors on Facebook, let alone talk to them is such a creepy way. They never schedule a meeting or anything like that, but they joke about writing, papers, books, and all kinds of weird shit that sounds like shitty code. 

My wife got back from her run about an hour ago and I have no idea what to do. This is hardly strong evidence and maybe she's just helping a kid who has no friends. The kid seemed a little awkward on his facebook. This is just fucking creeping me out. I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety issues recently, so maybe I am over reacting. HELP!  

UPDATE: I am going to go talk to her now. I will let you all know what happens.

"UPDATE: My [24F] family [20s-70s M/F] says I'm too old for college and should drop out.


[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/526bvg/my_24f_family_20s70s_mf_says_im_too_old_for/?st=itm6h03o&amp;sh=0a7dda2a)

I made this update because I really want to thank everyone for their encouraging comments and PMs. It really means a lot to me and it's nice knowing that I'm far from the only person in this position.

And onto the update: I've deleted/deactivated all of my social media accounts so I can partly free myself from the negativity (relatives would sometimes write nasty passive aggressive or sarcastic comments on my posts). I've also decided to skip family get-togethers and holiday gatherings for the next several months or so. If they're still unsupportive in six months time I know they don't deserve to be a regular part of my life.

As for my parents: I had a long - and uncomfortable - talk with them. It turns out that my mom has been reading news and economic articles with a pessimistic outlook. Articles saying that economic growth is forever slowed, millennials will never reach the earning potential of previous generations, robotic/AI technology will replace all workers and render human labor obsolete, etc. She thinks that any attempt to improve myself is ultimately in vain (my dad doesn't have an opinion on the matter).

To be honest, I'm very worried about all of these things, especially AI technology, but there's really nothing I can do to stop it. All I can do is my best and improve my skill set in the mean time.

I've asked my mom to please keep her opinions to herself for the next few years. So far she has (since the conversation).

"My[21F] landlord/roommate [46F] imposes a curfew on me, and it's interfering with my life.


Hi! I'm currently renting a room with a woman and her preteen son. Things started out pretty okay, they were and still are very sweet and welcoming to me. 

They were a lot more familiar with me than I was comfortable with at first though, something I didn't really mind because I assumed they were just really friendly. The mom, though, almost acts as though she's my own mom and it's weirding me out. She asks that I check in with her and tell her where I'm going when I leave/where I'm coming from. It's kind of...really strange to tell my landlord where I'm going every time I leave the front door. She asks me to have meals with her and her son and is really disappointed when I refuse (I have dietary restrictions and eat on a different schedule). When I moved in also she kept talking about how it's almost like her son has a big sister now...

Recently she has imposed an 8:30 curfew on me, 9 on weekends. She has doors that sound a loud alarm whenever they open and close, and I totally understand and empathize with her that she doesn't want to be woken up by them when she's asleep due to me coming and going. I was bothered though because she started off the conversation by saying ""So that foreign exchange program is still looking for host parents and I was thinking of saying yes..."", implying that she wanted to kick me out. I don't know if she meant it as a threat but it seemed like an odd way to discuss an issue. 

My biggest issue is that I would like access to the alarm and to be able to disable it when I come and go so as to not wake her up. My room is on the opposite side of the house from hers, right by the entrance, and she does not even hear when I walk by her room to use the bathroom. It's really just the loud alarm. I study in a really intensive major with a huge workload and lots of extracurriculars, and some of my classes go past the curfew. I also need to pick up a part time job and there's no way I could do that when I have classes all day and that early of a curfew. I discussed this with her and mentioned that I told her that before I moved in, and she said she ""doesn't know anybody who needs to work and be away from home that much"". She's a stay at home mom who's never been to school or had a career. She's also really annoyed that I'm never around, and I leave in the morning and get back at curfew while she is home all day and her son comes home at 3:15. It's weird because it's like...they expect me to fit into their nice little family? But I don't have the luxury of being able to come home early and sit around and cook dinner with them. The internet here is always awful so I'd rather study at school where it's more reliable.

My solution so far has been to stay with school friends at their dorms or off-campus apartments if I can't make it home for curfew, and to come home in the morning. However, she told me that she wasn't okay with that either because she doesn't know my friends and the anxiety over my safety keeps her up late at night. She also insists I have my schoolmates over for dinner so she can meet them. Is it just me or is this overstepping? I feel like she's taking a role in my life that I am NOT comfortable with in any way. Even though I pay quite a bit in rent I wouldn't be able to find another comparable place to live this late into the semester. Many people are already matched with roommates and I cannot afford to live on my own. I think this situation can have a solution but I don't really know what to do.

"Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 3 years. She keeps dropping hints that she expects a proposal, and I'm not ready. We have a long trip planned soon, and I know she'll be miserable there if I don't pop the question. Should I warn her before we go that it won't be happening while we're there?


We're visiting our college, which is important to both of us, for homecoming. Her whole family and my whole family will be there. She has mentioned multiple times, and had her best friend text me, that that weekend is her ideal time to be proposed to.

I'm not completely ready to propose, and I know I will not be doing it in 2 weeks. I think I want to propose to her eventually, but not right now. Should I talk to her before we go so she knows exactly where I stand so she doesn't get let down when while we're there?

TLDR: Big weekend coming up, she expects proposal, it's not coming. How to warn her it won't be coming?"
"My [14M] dad is a CEO. It's impossible to get hold of him and mom and we need their permission for something


My sister and I are really starting to feel frustrated, It's actually impossible to get hold of our father and mother. Most if not all communication Monday-Saturday goes though assistants and security. 

They both travel for work and if not they are in their fancy building in Mid Manhattan. My father and mother are just so caught up in their business and dressing us up and dancing us in front of all their friends and playing happy family. We both hate each and every single one of their friends/their friends children who we are 'friends' with. (we come from a wealthy family)

My sister and I have this opportunity from out private school to go a college for the day. Our school has this obsession with keeping most of the kids that graduate from there going to college. So we get to go talk to people about scholarships and have a look around campus with a guide. We are freshmen but apparently it's part of some program. We need it signed and we can't get hold of him. We both just got home because school ended at 1 today. There is something going on with our school (it's private) but this is the only day it's happening. 

tl;dr:Can't get hold of parents/see them in person"
