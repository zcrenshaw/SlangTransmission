Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x4iwk/i_29f_had_a_nightmare_relationship_with_an_older/

Well, thanks for your feedback, guys. Wanted to give you an update.

So something I failed to mention in my last post is that my mom used to teach at my alma mater before she recently retired. She didn't know about my brief relationship with Kevin years ago. After writing my post, I decided to share with her everything that happened.

Mom immediately got this weird look on her face and said she knew exactly who I was talking about because she used to teach in my department. She said, ""I don't think Kevin will be a problem for you."" When I asked why, she said, ""Trust me, you'll see. That guy is kind of a loser.""

So I went to the event, and it was amazing. I took some of the advice here and brought a girlfriend so I would never be alone in case Kevin tried to pull something. I met a bunch of alumni and ran into a couple people who I lost touch with when I got sick. Everybody were thrilled to hear how well I'm doing, and my speech got an ovation when I was done.

Anyway, Kevin showed up with his wife. I don't know how to say this without sounding mean, but he's gotten fat and is going bald. I was surprised at how old he looked until someone told me he's almost 50 now (which means he lied to me when we were dating and said he was younger than he really was). Also, I heard from old classmates that Kevin is **still** studying for his degree, plus working nights as a security guard now.

Kevin was the only person at the event who avoided me. Like, it was obvious. I thought he was going to avoid me all night until I accidentally found myself alone for 30 seconds, which is when he nervously approached me to congratulate me. I smiled, said thanks, and kept moving. He tried cracking a dumb joke to me later but I just ignored him, which seemed to frustrate him. Overall I just spent the night focused on the people around me and forgot he existed.

Interestingly, he managed to repeatedly piss off a bunch of people (including his wife and one of the deans) throughout the night with stupid comments. It got so bad that people started a running joke about what an insensitive moron Kevin was.

I'm so glad I went and didn't allow one jerk from my past to make me hide. I had a great time and was surprised at how unafraid I felt when I saw Kevin again. The memories from that time of my life were so traumatic but now he's just some jackass I once knew. I'm not sure now WTF I ever saw in him or why I was ever scared of him.

Oh, and by the way, I recently started a great new job that came with a big raise, which means I'll have my student loans paid off this year. Life is good. Thanks for your help, Reddit.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr: Ran into asshole ex and realized he can't hurt me. Had a fun time meeting people and ignoring him.**

EDIT: Aw, the comments got locked fast. Two things I wanted to add:

* an acquaintance recently told me that apparently Kevin and his now wife were in an open relationship for a long time (including while he and I were together), and that she closed the relationship again a few years ago because she got annoyed. I can only imagine the shenanigans. I feel better knowing he didn't cheat on her, even though he still cheated on **me**, and of course he didn't tell me about his wife at all. Whatever.

* My favorite part of the evening: I blocked Kevin on Facebook years ago, so he's had NO updates whatsoever on my life including the fact that I go by my birth name now. In college, everybody called me by a nickname, but no one's used it now in years. So all night he kept calling me by this super old nickname. People kept looking at him like he was crazy and asking, ""Why are you calling her that?"", and Kevin got super frustrated because he realized everybody was in on some joke that he didn't understand. No one would clue him in, I guess."
"I [27f] have started doing all of the things my husband [28m] doesn't want to do with me on my own.


My husband doesn't like to go out much. It's not something that I've ever faulted him for or been mad at him about. We've never gotten in fights about it til now and it's something he told me upfront when we had first gotten in the relationship 4 years ago. ""I'm never going to be the kind of person that likes to go out a lot, I just want to hang out at home"" and I of course said that it was fine because that's not a flaw to me, it's just a character trait. 


I used to suffer from depression due to a lot of traumas in my life. I found it really hard to go outside at all, and especially alone. I missed out on a lot of experiences because of this. In our first year of dating, he got me to have more confidence in myself so I stopped hiding. I got a therapist and have been on a wonderful little antidepressant. We got married one year later and I'm still happier than I have ever been, and I'm incredibly grateful to have him in my life. That hasn't changed one bit.


Now, I know that this isn't want he does. I know that he doesn't stay inside because he's depressed, it's because it's in his nature to be a housecat. And like I said, I'm still fine with that. Lately he's not okay with me doing this, though. 


If I ask him if he wants to see a movie with me and he said ""no"" or the more common, ""I don't know, maybe"" I'll usually ask him two more times and then if he still says no or ""maybe"" I'll go by myself. It's the same with going out to dinner, taking little classes, etc. We had fun with this at first. I would come home from doing the thing and then I would excitedly tell him what I'd done and the people I'd met. He'd happily listen and hug me and kiss me on the forehead. It was a really beautiful thing. At one point we called it ""my little adventures"" and I would take polaroid pictures and show them to him and then hang them on the kitchen wall. It was a seriously beautiful point in our relationship and the times that we would go out and take polaroids together were some of the happiest times in my life. I even made it a point to have us do / go to things that *he* liked to do. It was great. It was seriously so great.


About two years ago I asked him, ""Hey, I've been really passionate about learning a language and eventually going to this languages place of origin. Do you want to study it with me and then go there too?"" and he said no to the language, but maybe to going with me. 


Cut to now and I'm pretty damn good at this language. I decided about four months ago that I am going to this place. I asked him and he would still like to come with me and he said no and got kind of upset that I had learned this language without him. ""You're the one that's going to know anything, there's really no point in me going."" I was kind of taken aback because during the process he was really supportive. I didn't really push it, but I apologized and went somewhere else to clear my head about things and we were fine later on that day. I bought the tickets for me and my mother to go ""the place"" about four weeks ago and ever since then, things have been really tense. If I ask him to do minor things, like come to the grocery store with me, he gets a bit of an attitude. I can tell that he knows this is ridiculous though, because he'll say sorry almost immediately and be sad and quiet the rest of the time.


I've tried to talk to him about what's bothering him, but he keeps either saying that it's nothing and he doesn't want to talk about it, or will tell me not to press it and then get mad and leave. I don't know what to do at this point. Our relationship has been so great, but I can feel things being strained. I can feel him kind of slipping away. I don't know what to do. I thought about buying him a ticket to ""the place"" anyway and surprising him, because I really would love it if he could go with me and I know for a fact it's somewhere he's always been interested in. But I also don't want to force him, because I hate forcing people to do things. However, I also don't want to do stop having these experiences for myself just because he doesn't want to. I've never faulted him for wanting to be at home, so why is he faulting me for wanting to be outside? I don't know how to talk to him or what to say. If I have to stop doing things, then... I guess I will? But I also feel bad for having to stop, but it's not worth getting a divorce over or having things escalate that bad. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here.

**Edit/Update:** Hi! Um, we had a bit of a long talk. I'm kind of a mix of exhausted / drained / excited now so I apologize if I make a lot of typos or word something wrong. In a kind of big nutshell: He said he feels like he's drowning in my success. I said I would learn a language and I did it. I said I would lose 180lbs and I did it earlier in our relationship and got the skin surgery. I have a pretty stress free job and it's getting to him. He's been trying really hard to just be happy but it's hard. He understands that it's wrong to feel this way and between feeling guilty about it and feeling this way at all, it's just been taking its toll. He also has a skin condition that makes him feel cautious of going outside, especially in another country. :( I never thought this would be the problem, because he's always acted as though it's not a bother to him at all and he doesn't care.  He's going to keep trying though, and to seek therapy independent of me because he thinks that he also may really be suffering from depression.


Now, I have to say that we *do* have communication problems. Our friendship (two years before dating) started off long distance in an mmorpg so we're still kind of better with text-talking than outloud speaking. Sometimes we have a hard time saying when things are bothering us out loud, so we'll text it out and then read off of that text because we find it hard to verbalise and sometimes we just take things harder than we should. We've agreed to go to marriage counselling and we're making an appointment together tomorrow, so there are good things afoot.

For more good news: He's agreed to go on vacation with me and my mother!

Also, I just want to say thank you to every single person who commented. It means a lot that people would wish us good luck and give advice and even say they were going to pray. Thank you for all of the advice! I'm trying to go down and thank everyone one-by-one but it might take a while, and in case I can't... thank you for helping save us.  

**Uh, edit to the edit!** I would also like to add that I messed up in this, too. I liked to think that hearing maybe / other apathetic answers instead of just yes or no didn't bother me, but it did. And sometimes, as some people pointed out, I would get kind of passive aggressive about it. I'd ask him simply because it meant that I tried at times. I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I'm going to work on that more and myself as well.

"My [28F] boyfriend [30M] of 18 months has gotten my sister [21F] pregnant. What do I do now?


[removed]"
"UPDATE SO [28M] of 9 years called off our wedding, implying we were over. Is this something I [26F] could make work for us?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5r01hl/so_28m_of_9_years_called_off_our_wedding_implying/

**Tl;dr he called off the (big) wedding because we were both stressed and originally wanted to elope. Can we work through it?**

No, we couldn't because he cheated. I found out this morning through anonymous Facebook message that he wasn't loyal and there was more to the breakup than I knew. I called him twice with no response. So I sent him a text about the message. Still no response. So I decide to check his phone records. Lo and behold, a mysterious number popped up like the day things started to go downhill for us. He'd call the number on nights I was working and text it throughout the day. 

Soon after I saw that I checked Find My iPhone (he got his first iPhone and I helped him set it up like 2 weeks ago). His GPS showed at a random house near downtown that I know none of his friends lived at. Soon after that he called me. He denied it all and was trying to be all supportive. The moment I said I had proof he was hiding things from his phone records, his entire demeanor changed. He specifically stated ""I didn't sleep with anyone."" Which was odd since I never brought up cheating. 

As he was talking I checked find my iPhone again and from the distance, it looked like he left wherever he was and called as soon as he was in the car. I asked where he was and he said driving. I asked from where and he got very defensive saying it wasn't my business since we weren't together. I reiterated I knew he was hiding things from me (I still never brought up accusations of cheating yet). He called me creepy and stalkerish. I asked who the specific phone number belonged to and he refused to answer saying I was crazy. So I said I deserve to know and he said a friend from work (for the next few minutes he refused to assign it gender pronouns). A little bit later I pushed it it was a woman and he admitted it. So I asked who it was and said if it were the few women I know, then I get maybe he was venting to them. He refused to answer. 

So yeah. We can't work it out. 

Also prior to this he was already acting like a hot and cold jerk for the week after he  left me on the day of my bridal shower. Either acting like he didn't care one bit about me or that he wanted me back because his life was falling apart. Needless to say, I became more relieved that the relationship was over and was more mourning the fact I was in the position I was in (cancelling a wedding after a failed engagement). I realized he was very selfish and I took on every responsibility in wedding planning and our relationship while he had nothing to do but work and come home to play video games. For the record, I like video games but only when I have the time. Basically this was the icing on the shit cake and any bit I had left hanging onto the relationship went right out the window. 

I honestly feel relieved. I don't feel sad. I feel... free. And happy. I'm not sad being in the apartment we shared anymore. My sister had helped me two nights ago set up a new bed that help change the entire look of the bedroom. 

Also Monday I'm going to a theme park with a coworker. While I'm not exactly trying to jump right into anything, he's a great guy and we have the same interests. It's just nice to have attention from someone I get along with. 

Tl;dr ex-fiancé cheated. I moved on. 

Edit: Yes, I'm getting tested ASAP"
"I'm (28F) not sure if what mt therapist (30sM) said to me is creepy and inappropriate


So I started seeing my therapist a few months ago and after the first session I decided I liked him and felt like I could trust him. We've recently been doing some work on my lack of assertiveness/ inability to call people out if they upset me because I'm scared of hurting their feelings.

I can't exactly remember how the conversation went but he suddenly said ""can I be honest with you? And I hope you trust me enough to listen and not take this personally but from the moment I met you I could tell you were very vulnerable. I knew that if I wanted something more from you than a working relationship, I could have had it. You're in a vulnerable position here, I'm a man who's stronger than you and I could see your vulnerability, I knew you wouldn't say no""

First of all this pissed me off because obviously I would say no, I'm engaged and also am not about to fuck my therapist regardless of my situation. Second of all I found it really creepy and unprofessional. I get the point he was trying to make, I just don't understand why he had to use that theoretical situation. 
Third of all, why the hell was he wondering whether he thinks he could take advantage of me or not in our first session?

Another important point is that I was raped in the past and he is fully aware of this. He brought it up and said ""I can see how it happened, you didn't give him the right signals that you didn't want to have sex with him. By the way I'm in no way suggesting that it was your fault"" I couldn't help but think that he totally was suggesting that and it really upset me. Also, that's not even true- my rapist was fully aware I did not want to sleep with him. I can't stop thinking about it but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. Maybe I just didn't want to hear what he said so I'm thinking he's wrong to say those things when in actual fact he's just doing his job?

He's said other slightly weird things in the past that I've let go and assumed I was being oversensitive but I can't stop thinking about this.

TL:DR Therapist basically said he felt like he could fuck me if he wanted and I probably wouldn't say no. Went on to hint that my rape was my fault. Do I sack him off?"
"[UPDATE] Me [29/F] with my husband [28 M] of 3 years, my friends ignore him because he's foreign even though he speaks English.


So, a few month ago I posted this ( https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53er7n/me_29f_with_my_husband_28_m_of_3_years_my_friends/ ). It didn't get a ton of attention, but recently, I got to this bottom of this shit and it's worse than I thought. Turns out almost none of my ""friends"" are friends at all... even ones I've known since before I knew Sasha.

Our company Christmas party was in December. Sasha hadn't met a lot of my coworkers, so of course, I introduced him politely to everyone that came up to say hi to me. Most were warm, almost all were shitfaced (open bar, my husband doesn't drink however so we weren't drinking). We made our way over to the food, and one of my colleagues comes up, throws herself onto Sasha, stroking his chest, looks at me with wide eyes and goes ""OP, HE'S SO FUCKING GORGEOUS, OMG HE'S SO HOT"" over and over again. Whatever. I wasn't insulted, my husband was really nice about it, she was falling down drunk, who gives a shit.

I hear nothing else until 3 weeks ago.

Luckily, my husband just got a great job (yay!). Three weeks ago, he had to go about 3,000 miles away for a work conference. Since I was home alone, one of my colleagues I've known for 3 years calls me up and invites me out. Nice, right?

No.

We get back from our outing, she asks to come inside. I agree, she comes in for coffee. We start talking, and I mentioned I was glad that she called me up, because I was a little lonely without Sasha. The conversation goes like this:

Coworker: You just LOVE showing him off don't you?

OP: ..What? What do you mean?

Coworker: Well, me and [another coworker's wife] were talking about how you were showing him off to everyone at the Christmas party.

OP: You mean introducing him to people he doesn't know to be polite? He's my husband.

Coworker: Well, if that's what you want to call it. We were also talking about how we were surprised you were allowed to work [VIP section].

OP: I think I look great, I think I fit in well there.

Coworker: Your body looks good, but that's about it. By the way, you can kick me out any time, I know it's getting late.

OP: I'M GOING TO BED NOW.

So, basically, most of my female coworkers are a) jealous b) see my husband as some sort of man candy, not a person and c) think I am somehow not ""good enough"" for him.

I told Sasha about it when he got home. I usually am not one to get upset but this really got under my skin. He laughed about it, said he understand why it upset me (""She manipulated you and attacked you in our home, of course that is upsetting"") and concluded with ""You know in your heart, if you're a mean, nasty girl, you will end up acting like a mean nasty girl eventually"".

I went scorched Earth on all of them. Now we interact in a civil manner at work but I no longer associate with any of them beyond that.

The happy ending is, my relationship is still great, AND! we are moving the fuck out of this judgmental close minded incestuous shithole in two months.

Thanks everyone for your comments on my OP :)

"My girlfriend [23F] checks my [27M] phone, asks to get engaged almost daily.


Hi Reddit/r

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. 

She asked me out during my last year of college and things went from there. I will say that during the first month to 6 weeks she became attached very fast. I'm talking light your brains on fire sex every single day and her telling me how much she loves me.

fast forward 2 years and there is absolutely no sex, no foreplay, nothing.

It has been this way for 6 or 7 months. She suddenly wants to wait until we get married. She asks if I am going to propose almost every day. ""When are you going to propose? Did you buy a ring? Why haven't you proposed yet?""

No, I have not gotten a ring. Her constant talk of marriage makes me uncomfortable. 

But also, she checks my phone a lot. Any female friend I have (not many as she is extremely jealous) gets me 20 questions. Whether they're snap chats, work texts or if I see someone in public, I get grilled.

I notice that I receive snaps and they're already opened so I miss them. She looks over my shoulder when I text or asks every time who I am texting. It's pretty crappy.

Here's the other side to this coin...

She has TONS of guy friends. Orbiters if you will. A bunch of single blokes who constantly snapchat, message or call. Does it bother me? not really. The double standard bothers me more.

She flipped out on me for having a conversation with an old friend (girl-in a 6 year relationship) from college last week and took my phone and began to type a rude message. I managed to get my phone back before she pressed send.

But I notice that when she texts, she turns he body so that I would have no chance to see the screen. Specifically, she just met this new dude and I know she's messaging him (she told me) as a new friend. Yeah... 

Honestly, I don't trust her anymore because I feel that she does not trust me or herself.

There's more to the story... but you get the idea.


I DONT CHECK HER PHONE.

But her behavior is throwing up a bunch of red flags.

"My [24F] friends [22-24F] have stopped inviting me to hang out with them. We have a group trip coming up and now I'm not sure if I should go.


My group of ""friends"" has basically stopped inviting me every time they all hang out together. The last few times I was actually invited was to more planned events like the ""friendsgiving"" we did around Thanksgiving and a Yankee swap around Christmas time. Other than that, they all hang out every weekend (they post snapchats and Instagrams together) and I never get the invite anymore. 

Recently one of the girls texted me ""I miss you!!"" and I took that as an opportunity to point out the fact that, well, if you miss me then you haven't really been making an effort to hang out with me. I gave a specific example like ""on Sunday I noticed that you were all together and I wasn't included, so I'm not really sure what to do since I'm not getting invited to anything you guys do anymore."" Something along those lines.

Her excuse was ""I'm soo sorry I woke up drunk and then kept drinking all day, that's my bad.""

Well, okay, but that's a super shitty excuse. ""I was drunk"" doesn't really excuse ANY type of behavior. It also doesn't explain at all why I've been excluded from everything else as well. I let it go because I don't want to dig my own grave by starting an argument about it. 

I think it's important to mention that I'm the only one in the group with a serious boyfriend, and I think that is probably the main root of this issue. However I would always make time for my friends if they would just invite me, so... I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It's not like I'm getting invited and then decline all the time to hang out with my boyfriend. Back when I was still getting included (few months ago), I made time for them every single weekend and it was a lot of fun. I honestly don't know what has changed since then. I have invited them to do things with me and they all give some kind of ""sorry I'm doing something else, but have so much fun girl!!!"" excuse.

So now after weeks of being excluded 95% of the time, we are coming up on a weekend trip to [insert city here]. This is something we all booked MONTHS ago because we got a good deal, and I was obviously still being included back then. 

I texted our group chat trying to make plans in [city] and I swear to you nobody responded or wrote anything in that group chat for an entire week. At that point I took the hint and backed off. 

But now I just don't know if I should even go. The trip is in 4 days and these girls obviously don't want to be around me for some reason. I'm just thinking, why put the effort in with this group if they aren't returning that effort at all? Why go spend a ton of money in [city] with these seemingly fake friends? Why go put myself in a situation where I'm stuck with people who apparently don't even want me to be there? I have invested about $150 for this trip so far and I'm ready to just accept the loss for that.

At the same time, I don't want to alienate myself from the group and give them even MORE of a reason to keep excluding me. But I'm kind of over these people. They have made it clear that they don't see me as a friend. It feels like I'm in high school again and I'm starting to think that I should just move on from these girls.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? Should I suck it up and go on the trip? Should I bail for a seemingly innocent reason (oh I couldn't get work off), or should I bail and let them know why (you guys are shitty friends)?

Thanks in advance for your help. It feels really shitty to be excluded like this for seemingly no reason, and I just want to hear an outside perspective.

  **tl;dr**: Friends recently stopped inviting me to hang out with them, and I don't know why. We have a trip coming up this weekend (that was booked months ago), but now that I'm being deliberately excluded from the group I'm having a hard time deciding whether I should even go anymore. Do I go or not? Do I confront the group or just move on?

  ---   
  **EDIT**: So I've been busy at work all day and this got a lot more comments than I expected, but THANK YOU everyone for replying. I'm reading through everything. I guess this is a pretty common scenario. The two main responses seem to either be ""drop them, don't go, they aren't worth it"" or ""are you really making enough effort to be their friend, invite them, find out what's going on, etc?"" This made me think that hey, maybe I really haven't been making enough of an effort because I've been feeling down that they haven't either.

I still have some time to decide, but right now I'm leaning toward going on the trip to make just ONE more effort with this group. We do always have fun when we're together. I've already put money toward the trip so why not just go? If we become just ""fair weather friends"" afterward, that's okay with me. We basically already are anyway. But I am afraid that me bailing on this trip will genuinely be the end of these friendships. Is going a bad idea? Am I letting the fear of being friendless/alone cause me to make a bad decision? Can you tell how indecisive and back-and-forth on this issue I have been? Lol. Thank you again everyone.

  **EDIT 2**: I just checked snapchat to find out that everyone bought tickets to see [insert comedian here] next month and they're ""SOOO EXCITED!!"" Didn't get any sort of invite on that one either. Lol. I'm starting to get the picture. However, I'm going to keep my head high, remain friendly with everyone, go on the trip and try to have a good time. After that, I don't care what happens next. I'd rather take the high road than confront everyone, start drama, and stir up a ton of shit for no reason. They're not worth it and I see that now, but backing out of the trip would cause more trouble than it's worth. I think."

____________________________________________________
Hi again, Reddit! I just wanted to thank you all for the amazing comments (excluding those who told me that they had obviously slept together/were still together despite knowing nothing outside the context of the post). For the most part, the advice I got was extremely helpful, and it helped me work through a lot of things.

It's been two and half months, so I'm not totally 'over it,' but I'm healing. My husband did something stupid and hurtful, and I did consider leaving him, but ever since this happened he's done everything in his power to make me feel cared for and appreciated. He's genuinely remorseful, and in my eyes, he's earned a second chance. We've also just started couple's counseling, and that is going well so far.

For the first few weeks after he confessed, we didn't have sex. Even being naked in front of him felt wrong, since I was not only angry but constantly comparing myself to this woman. Neither of us is the type to give up, though, we each took a week off of work to have a little 'staycation'. At the end of it, we decided, we would know if we were going to stay together or break up.

It was amazing. We caught up on Game of Thrones, lounged around and ate pizza in our underwear, and got drunk off of wine. We talked (a LOT), we cried, and in the end I do think we managed to come out of it in a healthy place. On our last day off, we went to the same restaurant where he took the other woman on a date. At the table, we did a silly little ceremony to re-christen it as a place for us, where her presence doesn't matter. And you know what? It doesn't matter as much any more. She doesn't mean anything to us (he was eager to block her on everything and lets me look through his phone, though I haven't been doing it lately because privacy and all that).

Not to be too TMI, but we're having sex again, better than it was before we reconnected like this. I feel like we've regained a spark that we haven't felt in a while.

I still think about the other woman sometimes, but I'm not obsessive like I used to be. She may have seemed perfect to me, but I don't know her, and there are a million little flaws and quirks that I never got to witness. My husband has been with me for 12 years, and I just have to keep reminding myself that he still chose me.

tldr: Generally happy update! I'm healing, my relationship is bouncing back stronger than ever, and we're in therapy. I don't obsess over his fling as much as I used to, and hopefully it'll only get better with time."

"found Tindr app on my (32f) husband's (32m, married 4 years) phone. He says its for a ""joke"" and goofing with his freinds. Since I'm mostly unfamiliar with how Tindr works, is it possible he's being truthful?


So like the title says, I really only know Tindr from its ""buzz"" and have no interaction with it personally. It's buzz obviously is that it's solely a hookup app.

How I found it...phone died while we were on way to new store so I asked to borrow his from the passengers seat for directions. When looking for his waze app I saw Tindr. We had our kids in the car so I didn't want to make a big deal so after we checked our kids in at the child care (IKEA) I asked him about Tindr. He sort of tuned white, said it was just for the ""joke"" and that sometimes he and his friends use it to chat at work so it's private on not on the work computers. I wasn't sure so we just went about our day, but was obviously tense. I asked to use his phone again to find directions and notice he had deleted the app. I asked him why and he said it wasn't worth me being ""suspicious"" and it was no big deal to delete.

From people who have used the app before, does his story make any sense at all? I have no evidence of him cheating and don't want to break up our family but his actions have made me go WTF to say the least.

  **tl;dr**: I found Tindr app on my husband's phone. He says its a ""joke"" and uses it to chat with his freinds ar work. He then quickly deleted it. I don't know how it works so want some advice on the viability of his story. Thank you."

"[Update] Me [20/F] in love with a guy [21/M] but I'm embarrassed to introduce him to my family


The link to the original is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qj3lt/me_20f_in_love_with_a_guy_21m_but_im_embarrassed/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit). 

So, I first wanted to thank everyone for their kind and supportive comments. On the drive from school to my place, we were talking and I brought up the subject of wealth and the differences between the middle class and the wealthy, such as lifestyle, etc. He knew I was going somewhere with it, so I flat-out told him. Yeah, I could have been more delicate. 

He was really hurt, and said that he's not sure why I would feel that way but that he certainly would not hold anyone's wealth (or lack of it) against them. Families are families and that's what is important. I realized I that a lot of this was in my own head which made me feel like a real butthole. 

We stopped at my home and my parents, sister &amp; brother met him. My brother, who is 16 asked if he owned a Ferrari and/or could he buy one. Carl laughed it off and said he was banned from owning Ferrari after leaving a chocolate bar in the glove box. I was really impressed with how well he handled himself and impressed that he knows/understands more Spanish than he lets on. 

He went home and my family sat around playing cards. I told my parents how relieved I was that things went well and they asked why. Again, I should learn to clamp my mouth. I told them I was worried about the disparity in wealth, etc. They were a little hurt, but fortunately, my big mouthed sister said that Carl was slumming it. That took the attention off me and onto her. 

Saturday, Carl came over at noon, brought a gift (which was really sweet and well-received) and we had a *great* time. My abuela, my aunts &amp; uncles all think he's really great. My parents like that he's grounded, smart and driven. My abuela loved that he loves to eat. She fed him a lot of everything, so much so that he wound-up laying on the floor to digest. Everyone thought he is really nice and that we make a great pair. 

My sister.... you were all right, it's a jealousy thing. She kept trying to intimate that it must be hard to be at poor people's houses and that being with all these Mexicans must be really scary. When I'd hug him or cuddle-up with him, she'd get passive-aggressive and make comments about how I was no longer pure (my sister is one to talk), suggested that he could do better and told him about the time I poured water on her painting (I was 2...). She got upset when my brother showed interest in Carl, both bonded over a love of cars. My sister was a nuisance the entire day and eventually left. 

She came home later on, and to her credit, she apologized. She said she was angry that she's older than I am, but still single and that I had met someone who made me happy and seemed to be a really earnest and nice guy. We had a nice chat and she sincerely apologized. She seems to like Carl but was upset and you guys immediately picked-up on that. 

All-in-all, it went really well. I was so happy at the end of the evening that I gave him a kiss and told him I loved him, and he immediately told me he loved me. It was fantastic! Driving back soon and I feel really fortunate and wanted to thank you for giving me the right advice. Doing what I wanted to would have just been rude/idiotic and I shouldn't let my neuroses, or other people's problems, get in my way.

  **tl;dr**: Went much better than planned and everyone really liked Carl. Wealth/Race was hardly an issue; learned that Carl speaks/understands more Spanish than he lets on and we exchanged ""I Love you""s for the first time!"

My girlfriend of 3 years has never once let me see her twitter/insta/snapchat. I've asked a few times over the years and she would normally divert the conversation and I would forget about it. This wasn't an issue in our relationship until tonight.

I asked her if I could follow her on twitter, and she met me with a resounding no. I asked for clarification and she blew up on me, saying how it wasn't fair for me to micro-manage her lifestyle and that she didn't want to deal with it. Should I be worried?

That was enough to make me believe that there was something on there I wasn't supposed to see. So now I'm at a position where I'm single for the first time in 7 years.

"Me [24 M] with my sister [17/F] duration, She shared private info out of malice


some backstory. First, my sister is staying with me because her mom is a mess and our dad is abusive. I basically just feed her and let her crash on my couch. She still spends time with her mom but if i didn't feed her and give her a quiet place to sleep not haunted by her mom she'd be a malnourished wreck. I feel responsible for her well being.

Second, I spend a lot of time writing very explicit material. Detail isn't necessary here, i think, but just know it's pornographic and far from vanilla. I've never shared it with anyone. 

We got in a disagreement over her mess in the bathroom/kitchen. I basically told her to clean after herself and threatened to ground her. 

Today at work my phone is blowing up, but i ignore it because i work for assholes who go apeshit if they see a phone. it's a bunch of her friends making fun of me. She had apparently skipped school, got on my computer, and shared the explicit material out of spite. it's on my desktop and i name the files very specifically so I'm not surprised she found them, but I'm not sure why she was on my computer in the first place. 

I got home and told her to go to her mom's place. I also deleted Facebook because I honestly don't use it and can't be fucked. I'm seriously considering just kicking her out for good. 17 is to old for that kind of extreme lashing out over such a petty issue, so i have to take it personally. The malice behind the act bothers me more than the act. 

Am I being to harsh?

"My (26M) fiancé (24F) gave me an ultimatum. Stop being friends with my Ex and stop our families interacting, or she will call of the wedding and our relationship.


Throwaway, for obvious reasons. I'm hoping to gain some insight by posting here, some outside opinions are something I would be very grateful for right now. 


Some back ground: My ex girlfriend Emma (26) and I (26M) were together for 9 years. We got ""together"" when we were 13, and broke things off when we were 22, we were friends since first grade. We grew up together, our families became quite close, and our friendship circles were always intertwined at some point or another (this will be important later). We drifted in different directions as we got older, and we realised what we wanted from our relationships were ultimately different. We no longer had romantic feelings for one other, so we decided we would be better off as friends. We were best friends anyway. There hasn't been anything romantic since we broke up, nothing of a sexual nature either, a quick hug here and there to say goodbye at most. I truly haven't felt ""that way"" about her since things ended and she's the same. The breakup was very amicable. 


Now, to the issue. My fiancé, Sarah, (24) and I have been together for almost three years, I proposed a few days ago and we are set to be married this year. I was so happy when she said yes. Our relationship has been great. Amazing communication, always smiling together, it's been wonderful. She knew about my past with Emma as I was very upfront with her about it when we first began dating, as Emma and I are still friends. Our families still get together for sporting events, have parties and hang out together all of the time. My parents are really close to hers, and our siblings ( 22M, 25F, 17F, 18F and 19 M) are good friends, too. They are all really close. They even have a weekly Pizza night, We also have a few common friends. I didn't want Sarah to feel uncomfortable at any point, so I tried really hard to let her know everything I could, and take the right steps to show her she is my number one. I would always include her in family events, make sure my family would spend time with her, and have even tried to create our own ""rituals"" together. I adore this girl, I think she is incredible and from the day I met her, I have been head over heels.


She hasn't voiced a single problem to me about any of this until today. She would even encourage me to invite Emma over to get togethers we have hosted, or along to movies or dinner with our other friends. I was under the impression Sarah really liked her, especially considering the extra effort she would make to include her. Sarah and Emma have always gotten along, and they haven't been anything but nice to one another, I thought they were friends. 


She told me today, after taking time to think about it, that our friendship is ""weird"", and shouldn't continue. She gave me an ultimatum. To end our friendship, or she will end the relationship. She said she feels disrespected I would ""even consider keeping someone I had a relationship with in my life"". I couldn't get a single word in before she left, she's staying with a friend tonight. I don't understand how any of this could happen, she seemed happy. This is meant to be a positive time in our relationship. She said nothing has happened between her, Emma or our families. 


I don't know what to do. She has been blowing up my phone with texts and I don't know what to say, I thought I did everything right. Emma and I are still friends (not overly close though), but we definitely don't cross any kind of boundaries together, we don't speak about anything inappropriate or do anything we should not . She is also in a relationship at the moment. We don't talk every day, and don't see each other one on one or very frequently. Sarah has also mentioned that she is uncomfortable with our families spending time together after we have broken up, and wants me to put an end to that ""behaviour"" as well. I can't control what my family does, who they see or who they are friends with. They have been nothing but kind to Sarah, they make a real effort to make her feel special and even include her family.

I don't know what to do? Is my friendship wrong, should I talk to our families? Or is this ultimatum unfair? 

TLDR: My fiancé wants to call off the wedding and our relationship unless I stop being friends with my Ex, and make sure our families are no longer spending time together. I don't know what to do. 

EDIT: I just want to mention (because I have gotten a few comments about it) that Emma and I are no longer close. I see her at events she is also invited to, or when Sarah invites her along with us and our friends to do something. I don't actively seek her out for one on one time, or invite her places myself, I don't even message her or text her. She's in a relationship, too. Our families are close, parents are best friends and our siblings grew up together (they even still have sleepovers), that means I'll see her places, or run into her, that is really hard to avoid, but I really do try. I wanted to make that clear. I have made an effort to set up boundaries to make Sarah as comfortable as possible, I've tried so hard."
"Me [26 F] with my husband [24 M] of two years. He just exhausts me.


I'd like input as to whether I am feeling this way because I am currently very sick, or if my feelings are valid.

A few days ago I went to the ER because I had a uncontrolled high fever, body pain, infrequent urination and tremors. Turns out I have a kidney infection.

Anyway, the issue is my husband. He is a paramedic. He is also very self-confident in his abilities. It has gotten to the point where I don't want him in the room when the doctor comes in! (I haven't said this to anyone though). My doctor is a PA (actually he keeps telling me ""shes not a doctor"") and a female. He has pointed out several times while we were here that he hasn't seen any males working at this hospital. We've literally seen the same like, 4 people the whole time we've been here.

I am just exhausted for making excuses for his sexist, demeaning remarks. Such as when the doctor (whoops- PA) asked me what medications I had taken, he interrupted and said a certain amount of Tylenol. She didn't agree that the amount he said was correct, and the REST OF THE NIGHT he googled articles about how that WAS the correct dosage. Even after it was like, over and done with.

I am very tired, and in pain. I am just wondering if I am being an emotional, hurt wreck. Or if his behavior is concerning?

"[UPDATE] My mother [56F] expects my sister [17F] and I [17F] to take care of our grandmother [89] every weekend.


Original: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t6hmk/my_mother_56f_expects_my_sister_17f_and_i_17f_to/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=relationships






Sorry I don't know how to link posts. I thought I'd post an update about my situation. I'm sorry I'm posting months later but I thought some people would like to know how things turned out.



While I was working up the courage to tell my mother I didn't want to take care of my grandmother anymore she surprised me. She came to me and said that it getting to be too much and that it was unfair that we were there every weekend and her siblings weren't. I was so shocked. We changed it to one weekend a month and it felt so good to have free weekends again!



However one of the weekends we were there I noticed that grandma was a lot more sluggish than usual. We couldn't get her out of bed and she could barely talk. She was really slurring her words. She was like this for two days and eventually our mom called us out of the rolls and told us that she was dying. I didn't really believe it but she called one of the head nurses and they came out to check on her and they basically confirmed it. She wasn't sick or anything so it was a shock. I was really scared that she was going to die right in front of me. I've never seen anyone die before. We eventually went home but our mom went back and stayed with her until she died. She called us and I was shocked. I knew it was coming but it was still a surprise to hear that it happened. When our mom came home that night she burst into tears as soon as she came through the door. My sister and I hugged her for a few minutes. I'd never seen my mother cry before. 



I didn't really cry then and I thought that there was something wrong with me for not being sadder about it. Then the funeral came and I cried like a baby. I think that was the worst day for my moms family. She was the matriarch and the oldest person in our family. What were we going to do without her? Although her death was sad I am grateful that didn't suffer much because she died in her sleep. All of her kids and grandkids and great grandkids came to see her before her death so she wasn't alone. She lived a long life and got to see her great grandkids and not everyone can say that. I feel guilty now for not wanting to spend time with her but now I'm glad I was able to help her so much before her death.




After the funeral many of my family member told funny stories about my grandma so she would be remembered well and so we wouldn't be so sad. I don't think she would have liked to see us so distraught over her death. I feel like she would want to be remembered in a positive way.



I'm so sorry that this is more like a vent than an update but I wanted to tell people what happened. It feels good to talk about it. It was a terrible time for my family but she's in a better place now. Thank you to everyone who commented and gave me good advice on my original post.



tl;dr: My grandma has died but she is in a better place and my family is recovering."
"My[29M] SIL [20F] kissed me and I don't know how to proceed now.


It's all still a bit shocking since it happened like a few hours ago. Julie (my wife, 27F) and Tanya (her sister) are extremely close. Years of family abuse left them hanging on to each other for a long period of time until finally when my wife turned 18, she took her sister and they both ran. 

I've been with my wife for 7 years now, we got married last year and honestly, I've never felt happier in my life. Julie is really the most amazing person you could ever meet. We do have our fights here and there but it's never something too serious. I do love my wife and would never even think for a second to ruin our relationship. 

Now as you've read from the title, something happened today. I've said that I was with Julie for 7 years and I have practically watched Tanya grow up right in front of me. She was polite and charming young girl (she still is) but I've never thought about her being something more than my wife's sister and I have never given any indication that I look to her like something else. 

Tanya has been staying with us for the past couple of days. Julie and I have our own place while Tanya still lives in the old apartment that they both used to live before. She has been going through a rough break up with her bf of 4 years and my wife offered her to come and stay with us for a while, 'till she feels better. 

Tany has been doing fine but she is still very heartbroken over her breakup. My wife would usually deal with her sister but I would often talk to Tanya as well, reassure her that it's gonna be fine, that she will get over him etc. But today was a bit different. 

Tanya was crying a bit more than usual. I heard her sobbing once I got back from work and it really made me feel bad about her. So I've decided to sit and just have a conversation with her. It really did help because she stopped crying and even cracked a few smiles at my attempts to lighten up the mood. As I would find out, today was supposed to their 4th year anniversary and this was the reason for her emotional outburst. 

We've talked a bit more and things got out of hand. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, like when she switched the conversation to me, how I am a great guy and how her sister is truly lucky to have found someone like me. How she dreams of meeting someone like me, how she would occasionally touch my hands, snuggle closer to me. It's truly baffling how I didn't see it coming and I feel awful about it. 

She kissed me and after a second or two I pulled away from her in complete shock. She looked equally terrified as well. I jumped like I just got burned and Tanya immediately went ""Don't tell Julie"" and ran to her room. After maybe an hour, she had already packed her stuff, thanked for the hospitality and left. 

I was left alone to process what the fuck just happened. All that is going through my head right now is ""What the Hell did I just did?"". I felt like I've just cheated on my wife, with her own sister on top of everything. Also for some reason, I feel like I've taken advantage of that poor girl. It's completely irrational and doesn't make sense yes I know, but it's how I feel. Like I've said, I should have seen this. I should have picked up on the subtle hints and remove myself from the situation. But I didn't and in the end, we both screwed up.

My question here is, how do I even begin to explain this to Julie? Do I even try and explain this to her? I know that if I hide this, for now, it will only maybe cause an even bigger shitstorm in the future if this comes out, somehow. So Reddit, what do I do now?
I've never felt this confused in my life and I definitely need help in this.

"Me 24f with bf 35m has ""recommended"" that I stop getting tattoos and not lose weight?


**edit: Thank you all for the outpour of support. Reading all of your comments and responses have given me a lot to think about. I've decided that I will be pursuing therapy in relation to my self esteem and confidence. I've found what seems like an excellent therapist and know that I can work to build my self worth. I'm going to continue eating healthfully and exercising to drop about 40 pounds so that I can play rugby this summer and look damn good doing it. I'll be having ""the talk"" with the BF tomorrow, face to face. It's time for some self healing and introspection! Thanks again, everyone :) **



I've been dating BF for about 7 months. We work for the same company in different departments. He is older than me, if that makes a difference. 


I am pretty heavily tattooed- 3/4 sleeves on both arms and a slew of others. I make sure to always cover them at work to the best of my ability  because we work in a pretty formal environment, but sometimes one or 2 will show (the tops of my feet when I wear flats, etc). Generally though, they are always covered. BF told me that he ""extremely dislikes"" tattoos and that I'm not allowed to get anymore. This was said jokingly, but he's repeated it several times. 


Frankly, I want more. He knows this. I don't know if getting them anyway would be disrespectful. Another issue I've had is that he's always harping on me to wear more colorful clothes. I haven't asked for his style/fashion advice; he one day told me out of the blue that I look like I'm going to a funeral whenever I'm at work (I actively idolize Wednesday Addams' wardrobe). 


Now, the issue is that I want to lose weight and become more fit. I have a desk job and generally feel like crap everyday being so sedentary. He is vehemently against this and insists that he likes my booty and everything else. While the appreciation is nice, I want to feel and look better. I'm beginning to question why he keeps feeling the need to mold me to his standards. I've never asked (or forbid) anyone ive dated to do anything modifying their appearance. I just think it's strange.



We joke around quite a bit and are often snarky to each other, but I never touch on his personal appearance. Am I being too sensitive? Is this a weird controlling issue that he has? 


Tl;Dr: bf doesnt want me to get more tattoos and wants me to dress differently. Is now against me getting more fit, claiming to like my body the way it is. Am I being too sensitive?"

"I [26/M] kicked my alcoholic in-laws [mid 40’s] out of the house and now my wife [28/F] won’t speak to me.


My wife and I have both aged out in foster care, since we both come from mentally ill, abusive, and generally unstable households. However, in recent years my wife, being the sweet, caring, and forgiving person that she is, reconnected with her bio parents and has been supporting them (and their addictions) financially since then.



Two weeks ago, my 12 year old son [biological half-brother/adoptive son] had to get his appendix removed and so my in-laws suggested to come stay with us for a few days in order to help out with our 6month old daughter, while we took care of our son. At least that was the very optimistic plan.



As it turns out, not only they didn’t provide any help, but we also had to babysit two alcoholics, adding to the stress of having a grumpy pre-teen who just had surgery and a fussy baby. 



My mother-in-law was the easy one; the real problem was my father in law, who is a well-known angry drunk. Smashing plates, throwing tantrums, and cursing on my wife for being “ungrateful” were just some of the things on a very long list. I asked my wife several times to kick them out but she refused, saying that “it’s not their fault for being like that” (I disagree).




However, despite everything, I would be willing to put up with them for the sake of my marriage, if it wasn’t for my son. My son spent the first few years of his life living with our alcoholic/junky mother, and I can see the damage that it did to him having that sort of people around him again. I’m a father first and it’s my job to protect my kids and my family from that kind of behavior. 



Right now my wife will barely speak to me, but I’m sure that she agrees with me. She’s just too kind and feels sorry for things that are not her fault. She wants her parents and I get that, but those people are abusive towards her and our family. I don’t want them anywhere near our kids… but I also know my wife wants them around… so I just look like the bad guy.

"Gf [25F] kicked butt at her massive promotion campaign. All credit for it stolen by someone else.


Gf works at a non profit.  It's a big one.  There were 2 projects on the books that she was working with a team from another city on.  The first project the girl from other city took the lead with the understanding that my gf would be the lead on the second one.  The other team then proceeded to obliterate the entire budget for both projects on the first one, and ended up with a lot of waste in the process. 

So second project start date comes around, she takes the lead and starts working on it.  The idea is to market to schools and general public to raise bucks for the org while promoting/educating a good cause.  The problem is no marketing budget.  The other city division starts doing their own thing and not really asking or coodinating in any way.  Rather than confront, her spineless boss decides to just let them do their own thing for their city, and she will handle the rest of the province.  No problem, so she does that.

At some point, the other city manages to score some more bucks from the org, and to fanfare announces this money wasting initiative to make and send these fancy packages out to schools as a promotion.  They of course send the gf a bunch to distribute to a few outside their city.  Spent a week on it, got it done.  

To date that tens of thousands of dollar investment has generated 0 in sales.

The gf on the other hand decided to do a direct marketing campaign through email and direct mail. Got in touch with people in high places, drafted a rather awesome marketing brochure, and sent it out to everyone that the people in high places said to send it to.  For the direct mail part the people in high places got their guys on it to do it for free. Aside from the time to set everyone up, total cost was $0. Currently thousands of orders are rolling in.  

Just today, a company wide email was sent out from the internal marketing team.  Saying how the event is looking to be a success and orders are coming in.  Good job team.  They then said that here is what we are doing, and then described the direct and email campaign, and gave a copy of the campaign brochure.  Which is of course my gf's brochure.  But where her name and info is, it's the coworkers in it's place.  And then of course said that this is the brochure that EVERYONE is getting and the reason for the sales we are seeing across the province.  GJ coworker!

It's so fucking blatant that she was just ripped off.  And of course now everyone in the company thinks that the thousands of sales and the entire campaign for that matter are from that other person...

The question now is wtf does she do?  She has a meeting with her spineless boss tomorrow morning to discuss this.  The idea is to escalate to a top level manager.  But what does she say, how does she craft this narrative, because this kind of thing is so past unacceptable.  But she is afraid of looking like he said she said not being a good coworker trying to steal limelight.

For other info: it's known that this is my gf's project by those working it.  There are tons of emails, from her and to other people including couple managers at the province level that this is gf's project, and she has in detail gave notes of what she is doing to update progress, given sales updates on her campaign, etc since she started working on it at the beginning..  It's very easily proven the marketing email is false and credit stealing.

The problem is that's like 2% of the company who know this as it wasn't company wide, just those directly above who had something to do with the project.

what we think happened:  As the gf did a lot of updates on what she is doing and gave a copy of the template she used, it's likely the other city just took that template, put their name in it, and just copied what the gf was doing for their city.  Not really a problem as they are free to do that.  Marketing then wanted to give an update, and since they are based in that city, went with the contact for that city as they are in fact running that campaign for that city.  And this is the result. Based on previous stories, I can assure you though that the other girl being listed as the credit province wide is no accident.  So here we are.

"My[27M] GF[25F] wants to move into a nicer apartment, I have no desire to since I'll be the one paying.


GF and I have been together for 2 years, living together for about 1. 

The apartment that I live in is a one bedroom, 700sq ft. Its in a nice area, has great amenities, and only costs about 1400/month. It was perfect for me before I met my gf, and has been perfect for me since she moved in. 

I should also mention, that I make much more than she does and so she doesn't really have much money leftover. No problem to me, I pay most of the cost of the apartment since I'd live here anyways. 

The issue that we've been arguing about is that she now wants to move into a nicer apartment, one that is much nicer and much more costly. Technically, I could afford it without much issue, but the problem is that I don't want to. Ultimately, because of our incomes, I'd be the one to pay for the majority of the cost, and have no desire to do so. I feel like I don't need a bigger, nicer apartment, and that I shouldn't have to ultimately spend a bunch more money because she wants to live there. 

Am I really being that unreasonable? What should I say to her?

Anita and I have been dating for almost a year, but we've actually known each other for 3. The day I met her I knew right away I wanted her in my life forever. I know it sounds cliche, but it's true. 
I've had a lot of girlfriends, even dated while being friends with Anita, but I never felt this way about anyone else before her. 

I'm extroverted and I like having friends and going out, Anita is an introvert and more often than not would rather stay home than go out with friends. This has never been a problem and we make it work, the only reason I'm mentioning this now is because I think it's relevant. While I like being social, I'm not an open book and most of my secrets and whatnot I have only told Anita. She has also told me a lot about her, secrets and life experiences, however there's a chunk of story from her teenagehood she never wanted to tell me. We were talking about it one day, and when it was her turn to talk about how she was like as a teen, she shook her head, said it was not a big deal. Then she told me she dropped out of highschool at 16, I asked her why, she shook her head again and asked to change the subject. 

I respected her wish and never brought the subject up again. 

That exchange happened a couple of months before we started dating. So, our relationship is very good, and I'm not kidding when I say I love this woman more than anything else in the world, but I know there's a secret in there that's linked to the way she's been acting.

Over the past month, her behavior changed a lot. At the risk of sharing too much, I have to say we both have high libidos and we have sex pretty much every day. But now she's started to want sex all the time and by all the time I mean we have sex in the morning, then again at lunch, then it's evening sex, then it's night time sex and that sounds pretty great and I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy at the beginning, but now it feels like she's using sex to deal with something that she won't tell me what it is. 

I try to talk to her about but she kisses me and tells me she needs me. She's also been crying a lot and that is really unsual because she hates crying, especially in front of people, and she never really lets herself cry. 

Yesterday I caught her sitting on the cocuh staring at nothing. I sat by her side to talk to her, and she jumped on me, barely gave me time to think. She hasn't been eating either, which worries me. I sometimes have to beg her to eat lunch.

I don't know what to do. I know something happened, I know something is making her act like this, but she won't tell me, she won't even give me the chance to talk to her about it. Having sex with her nowadays feels wrong because I know she's using it to cope with something and I feel like I'm taking advantage of her.

I don't know how to go about this, I don't know what to do. She barely laughs anymore, barely smiles. She tells me she needs me and it breaks my heart because I want to help her but I don't know what the problem is.

Has anyone been through something similar? Anyone have any idea of what could be causing her to act like this?

Any help and advice is appreciated, thank you.

"My wife's [53] son [25] and his fiance [22] are going into a dangerous level of debt. How to discuss this with them?


My wife's son is 25 years old and engaged to be married to a 22 year old woman. They both work low paying (15 dollars per hour) jobs.

They bought a house together last year. They have taken vacations on credit cards. She drives a late model car bought with a loan. She has $12,000 in student loans and is planning to borrow more. They have multiple accounts at various department and jewelry stores and are using them. They appear to be making minimum payments on all of these accounts and their credit cards. They plan to put a wedding for 200 people on their credit cards. They don't seem to understand the seriousness of the credit hole they are digging.

What is the best way for parents to discuss finances with their adult children? What is the most effective way to get them to realize the consequences of all this debt?

"My (42/f) husband (44/m) is turning into person that no body can stand! I'm on verge of deciding whether I should divorce him.


Until few years ago, my husband and I have a pretty normal life. My husband worked for a pretty well paying job that he absolutely loathe but wouldn't leave. I worked for the state and loved my job. We had a decent life for most part. We have four kids ranging from 11 to 20 years old. 

Two years ago, my FiL passed away and left a business and decent amount of money for my husband to inherit. My husband ended up sold the business almost immediately and got quite nice amount from it. 

That was when everything went down hill. My husband was talking about how he would no longer have to work and would just run a small side business to stay busy while enjoying his life. There was a lot of talk about all things we'd do that we had dreamed of. 

As soon as he started his side business, that failed in just a few months and my husband lose a lot of money in it. Next, he bought a few acres of land on developing area and had houses built on whole block with ours being the biggest one right in the middle. 

None of us but my husband wanted to move into that house. That didn't even budged him a one bit! He pretty much forced us all to move into that house. 

My husband became overly obsessed with his ""little empire"" as the kids call it. I tried to stay out of it as no body wanted any part of it. But my husband pretty much put himself in incredibly deep debt with numerous horrible purchase. He had purchased few brand new trucks, water tanker truck, few heavy operation engines, and many other things that end up never got used. He also paid to have security patrol the area and a maintainer to be on call 24/7 and more. 
After all of this, he have been trying to expand every sort of business he can think of. If he buy something, first thing he'd do is think of how many businesses he can start with it and how to make it happen. Yet, almost nothing has happened because no body take him seriously or want to work with him. 

He then keep try to get me to quit my job so I can work under him! He also is making the kids work for him and they hate it so much because he is always losing his temper over every thing and screaming his head off at them. The 20 years old even moved out because he absolutely cannot stand being pestered to work for his father. The 16 years old has tried to run away twice. 

Last few weeks, my husband had been really obsessed with every pennies. One day he blew a fuse big time when he found out I spent $200 of my very own money on shopping and yelled for a good hour about how I am being irresponsible with my money and how he's sick of supporting me. Other day, my youngest asked me if we can go to get ice cream, my husband heard this and came out to scream at us about how my youngest doesn't even care about money and made no effort to understand it! 

Now the kids are begging me to leave my husband. I have considered it and tried to ask my husband if he's willing to try get some counseling. That didn't flew well with him at all! 

Last night, my 20 years old found out my husband put pictures of him, my 16 years old, and me with short biography and bunch of false credible on his ""business"" website. He came over and totally thrashed my husband's office and left a note demanding my husband to take his name and picture off the website. 

My 16 years old then found out about this and got in a huge screaming match with my husband. It got so heated that I tried to get in between. They end up got in a physical fight over it that had to be break up by me!

My husband isn't even trying to listen. He keep going on and on about how he is trying to make everybody money and no one is appreciative of him. 

I have been trying to stay away from home just like as everybody else. I really don't want to break the marriage up, but I know the kids already cannot take any more and I really am at my last straw!

tldr: 

My husband inherited money and tried to start business. Now he's going crazy and pushing everybody away. 


Update: 

After reading all the comments and lot of thinking and talking with the kids, I had decided on giving my husband a ultimatum. I will take all the kids with me to a relative house. 

I will tell my husband that I had never ever asked for a penny nor tell him what to do with the money. But now, he have to at very least provide some money so I can afford to rent a house ASAP. Then we can try to work all this out and he will be required to see a counselor. 

If he didn't do this, I will go ahead and find a place I can afford on my own and file for a divorce. 

We will be going to relative's house this weekend and then it all depend on what my husband do from there. "

"Should I [25f] tell this girl [23-24f] I'm working on a project with, that I'm her step-brother's [25m] wife? She cut all ties with his family and hates them.


**EDIT: So sorry for the misunderstanding, but someone here pointed out that Mary is not Jim's step-sister but HALF-SISTER. As in, they have the same dad and different mothers. And they never lived together, they got introduced by their dad when Jim was 16 I guess?**

Okay so my husband, Jim, was born out of wedlock and so was his step-sister (we'll call her Mary). None of us (me and husband) were really aware of the current situation between his father and Mary's mother, but from what we know it's very hostile and the hostility comes mostly from Mary's mom's side. On the other hand, we are not blaming her, since Jim's dad wasn't always a nice man he is now, so who knows, probably she has her reasons.

I've never met Mary, because she only sort of tried to reunite with the family before I even knew my husband. After a while (still before WE met), for an unknown reason her mother started to be more and more negative about the whole thing and Mary followed, despite (according to my husband) being positive at first.

Me and Jim have been married for a year. It was a small, city hall wedding (not sure if that's the name though - not a native english speaker; what I mean is that it wasn't religious and in a church) and we barely invited anyone, only went for dinner and drinks with a couple of friends and parents after. Mary was informed of it on fb because Jim couldn't reach her on her phone (and started suspecting she changed the number) and she never replied and later blocked him.

So, I am currently working on my major and working on a few projects as a part of work placement (internship? again, sorry for my english).  I'm a designer, broadly speaking, and one of the projects is more like a public event and needs funding. So my work consists also of contacting various companies and asking to participate.

One of them gave me a positive feedback and even wanted to get involved on a people-level, so now I have a group of people roughly my age working ""under me"" (my age, but lower when it comes to work-hierarchy and degree, in this particular case I'm their direct superior). I particularly started getting along with this one girl on the first day, but then I checked up her info and I am pretty sure she's the Mary. Same surname, same name, similar face, even personality. No wonder we clicked - she's really similar to my husband and he's my best friend.

This is work environment and we should keep it professional.  On the other hand, it's been a few days, she's being more and more friendly towards me and I feel like a villain. 

She got along with Jim like a charm at first and yet she stopped answering her phone and never replied on fb after her mother started withdrawing, so I guess her loyalty to her mother goes beyond what's reasonable.

So, long story short, I am afraid of the drama. I am afraid she'll start treating me like air. I am afraid she'll ask to be reassigned and the company will start looking at me funny. On the other hand, we have roughly 2 months of working non-stop via mail and at least occasionally seeing each other, so can I really keep this a secret that long? And if she finds out later how angry she'll be with me then, knowing I deliberately kept this from her? My husband says he has no idea what I should do. He'd like her to know, but as far as he knows her, she may make the most dramatic exit the company has seen. 

So, should I tell her? Should I keep this a secret? Should I inform my boss about it in case drama happens? Please help.

**tl;dr for ~2 months I am going to work with my husband's step sister who cut all ties with his family. I realized who she is, but she has no way of knowing who I am. I wonder if, knowing what drama queen she can be and how much she hates everyone involved with husband's family, I should tell her and endanger the project we're working on (as well as my job itself).**"
"Me [49 M] with my wife [47 F]. Ex wife just died, not sure how to morn or why I feel the need to


Hi everyone, so I'm not sure what's going on in my head right now and I'd like an outside opinion. 

I'm at a loss for how to even start this please forgive me. Long story short, my first wife and I got married right out of college, we had an 'oops' soon after and had two beautiful twin girls a year later. We were able to make it work, our work schedules were offset enough someone was with the girls all the time. Well one of my wife's friends introduced her to drugs and she devolved into an addict by the time my girls were around three. After bouncing her into rehab over and over I finally told her to get clean or get out. She left to go be with her new boyfriend, who also happened to be her dealer. 

So for two years I juggled my career and parenting with the help of my mother. It was rough but we all made it through. For whatever reason my ex wife proactively relinquished parental rights to the girls so after I got her signature I never saw her again. 

I was running.myself ragged by the time the girls were five, my dad had a heart attack so my mom was overwhelmed between caring for all three of them. I was almost at my breaking point when I met Nadia, she was a friend of a friend and we hit it off and got married about a year after we started dating. It was a miracle I met her when I did, my daughters were too young to really remember their mom so Nadia stepped right into that roll for them, she's been the only mom they've ever known and she handled the shift from single career woman to juggling that plus the whole instant family situation she stepped into. She really was my angel.

So a few months ago my ex wife's son (she had more kids with her boyfriend) got in touch with me and said that she was dying from the effects of her addictions, and wanted to see my daughters and I. Passed on the news to my daughters and informed them that they were perfectly free to go or not go, if they wanted me to drive them I would but I wouldn't go see their mother again, I believed I had burried her when she divorced me. They went to see her with Nadia as I ended up working that day.

So yesterday I got another call saying my ex wife died. At first I wasn't really phased by the news but as the weekend's gone past I've been getting progressively more morose and moody. I feel like I should be mourning but I have two big things blocking me

* I have some kind of mental voice that keeps telling me that I shouldn't care, she abandoned me and two amazing girls who needed their mom more then I could have. I zeroed my substantial inheritance trying to get her clean and help her when she got in legal trouble.

*Nadia. Nadia has hated my ex with a burning passion. Her brother abandoned her nephew and her family spent years trying to help the boy recover from that, also Nadia can never have kids of her own it's a genetic problem, she's healthy but sterile. And so people who do have kids and then abandon them infuriate her to an extent i never seen out of her elsewhere.

How can I get over the death of my ex without upsetting my wife? I really don't even know if I should do anything beyond just shove it all away until the feeling goes away on its own. My ex obviously doesn't deserve me crying after all these years.
