"[UPDATE] I [25ftm] am about to come out to my parents [46m&amp;49f] as transgender and I'm kinda freaking out.

Hey Reddit, 

My OP didn't get much of a response, but I appreciate those who offered support/advice and wanted to give an update in case anyone was wondering. 


Originally, my weekend got a little more busy than I had planned, so I decided to move my coming out day until Tuesday. 

So, on Sunday, I called my mom to set up dinner (if I hadn't, I knew I would back out and not tell them) and my mom was feeling impatient I guess, because she was just like ""let's talk about it now"" and put me on speaker phone with my dad right next to her. 


So, I told them. And it went great. The first thing anyone said was when my dad immediately asked ""is that why you've been so damn weird the last three weeks?!"" Lol. Followed up immediately by a dad joke. 

We are all going to talk to my little brother about it (probably today my sister, partner, and I are all still going for dinner.) And I asked my parents to pick out a new middle name for me (I've decided to stick with my given first name, it's androgynous). My dad's immediate response was ""Alwayswantedabeard Man Lastname""

So I decided to let my mom have the final say in my middle name lol. 

I also set up an appointment to start hormone therapy in two weeks (and my insurance covers it!) So I'm pretty stoked about that. 

I hope you guys all have a great week!


Tl;Dr parents give no fucks, I feel like I just had 600 pounds lifted from my shoulders, I'm starting testosterone in a couple weeks!


**Edit: to everyone PMing or leaving comments calling me a ""sick fuck"" or any other derogatory term, I hope you realize one day how hurtful and wrong you have been. Especially if you ever have kids that end up struggling the way I did.**


**And to those of you (the vast majority in this post) who have been supportive and excited for me, I appreciate every single one of you, as well as your comments. Thank you.**

**Edit 2: my first gold ever, thanks guys. You've been overwhelmingly supportive. Thank you all. You're wonderful humans.**"

Thanks to everyone who gave me great advice. I basically ended up breaking things off with him after he, once again, was acting very rude towards me. I briefly let him know it is because I thought he was disrespectful and didn't feel like he even liked me.

He acknowledged that some of his treatment towards me was ""unfair"" but said he ""wouldn't have spent time with me and talked to me if he didn't actually like me."" There was also some other BS in there about how he doesn't feel good about it and tried to tell me that it isn't a good place to be in. Nothing he said really made sense, as usual. Lol.

All in all, I am pretty happy about my decision and although it didn't last too long, I should have called it quits one week in. Lessons learned!


**tl;dr:** Broke it off with him after he was rude and he tried to get me to empathize with him. Bye."

"I (M/16) want to stop parenting my dad (M/34) [UPDATE] happy ending


[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6h1ol5/i_m16_want_to_stop_parenting_my_dad_m34/)



I thought long and hard whether I should update this, but I really wanted to thank the people who gave me so much advice when I was in a tough situation.


I posted here about a month ago and even though, I do appreciate all the advice I got, most people wrote that I should be patient for a couple more years, till I’m an adult and then leave my dad on his own so he can either swim or sink. 



Though, I can see the logic in that, I hated that scenario. Reading all the responses was beyond painful so the second I saw my dad that same day, my brain exploded and long story short, I had a massive meltdown in front of him which involved an excessive amount of yelling, swearing and tears on my part, and complete silence and shock on his. 



I said this before but my dad is not a bad person, he loves me and our relationship is very good…he’s just lazy, childish and immature. All of which he admits! But apparently never thought of them as bad traits until he saw my meltdown. He told me that he never thought I would feel so affected by his actions and he only let me do all those things because he thought I wanted to do them, “because I’m the bright one”.



After a lot of things were said, my dad “promised” to change. It was decided that I would still help out, do chores, and do my part as a member of our family, but from now on I won’t be alone. At first I thought this would be another empty promise (an educated guess), but somehow he was serious this time. 



We started off with some easy stuff, like going to the market. He hasn’t been to one in over a decade. It took much longer than usual but it was actually very fun. We also made a deal to take turns with the laundry and cleaning the house (if either of us breaks the deal, we have to pay the other a fine of 20£). 



Cooking will still be done primarily by me because I don’t want a food poisoning, but he promised to watch some tutorials and try cooking from time to time. So, at least when I go off to uni he won’t starve or marry the pizza delivery guy. Baby steps.



As for the taxes, I’ll keep doing them because I don’t mind it too much and chose it as one of my chores (he took loading and unloading the dishwasher so I consider myself the winner). But once I get to uni an accountant will take over because otherwise my dad will end up in jail.


Overall… though I’m still embarrassed for that tantrum, I think that getting those things off my chest was very helpful. Not only I now don’t worry as much about my dad for when I move out, but I think it actually made our relationship even better. 


So, thank you, kind strangers for all the advice. I really do appreciate it.

"My sister [17f] and I [17m] finally found out the real reason our parents got divorced. How can we deal with the feelings of hatred we have toward our mother?


We don't really have anybody else to talk to about this, so we were hoping maybe we could get some advice and second opinions here. Our parents got divorced when we were around 7 years old. The memories are kinda blurry but I do remember that one day dad was in the house with us and the next he had his things packed and told us he was leaving. As little kids we were sad but eventually got over it as we were able to see both parents and they did everything they could to make us happy. 

I am not going to take trash about our mother, but she has been in and out of relationships so much we usually can't even remember the names of her exs as little as 4 months ago. We also have two younger siblings (7 &amp; 8) but we know they're only our half siblings. She has always told us that their relationship problems and why they divorced was none of our business and that what's in the past is in the past. We never dared to ask. But recently we heard her talking to some of her friends (they all get together and catch up at least once a month) about her and dad. I don't know if they forgot we were up there or just didn't realize how loud they were being but we heard all of it. Mom was telling them how when dad had his surgery (he was going through a illness but is fully recovered now) he was weak, depressed, and ""useless"" and she had another man that was ""giving her what she wanted"" the whole time.

The whole conversation is too long to repeat here but she kept on insulting him and calling him some cruel names. My sister started crying and left to go to her room. I went to comfort her but she was pretty shaken at some of the things she had heard. She told me that she hated mom and now that she knew the real reason why they divorced, she didn't want anything else to do with her. I understand how she's feeling and I'm furious about it as well, but I'm also confused on how we should handle this/or even if we have a right to be mad because it was so many years ago.

Honestly I don't see her in the same way anymore and I guess feel kinda ""betrayed"" (as dramatic as that sounds) because of how she treated dad. I know exactly how my sisters feeling. And I feel like if we don't control it we're just going to create more drama that we don't need.

"Me [24 F] with my soon-to-be BIL [29 M]. He is trying to create drama because he thinks I'm 'stealing' his brother/my fiance [26M]


Throwaway because we all reddit and know each other's names. 

I've been with Fred for 4 years and we are planning to get married next year. I met him after I had just moved to the UK and we instantly clicked. I hadn't planned on dating anyone but I guess sometimes life just happens. Back then, he was still living at home so I quickly met his father, stepmum, sister and brother Peter. They were all nice to me and very obvious happy that Fred had found someone. He has social anxiety disorder, so approaching me was a huge deal for him. 

After two years together, Fred moved in with me. That was the first time his brother and father displayed some dislike for me. They feared I was taking advantage of him and stealing him away. In my opinion, they also disliked that I encouraged Fred to go back to university and finish the degree he dreamed of instead of working a dead-end job in the family business (where he felt incredibly unhappy and controlled). 

After some time his family got used to it and everyone seemed very happy that Fred was doing something with his life. We got engaged and while everyone seemed happy, Peter took him aside fearing that I was trapping him or forcing him to get married. This really hurt me and installed a lot of fears. I questioned our entire relationship and whether I was controlling and pushy. 

Recently, we announced that we'll be moving across the country for our careers. I've got a paid PhD position and Fred landed a job in his dream industry (not many opportunities where we are right now). I think that was the final straw for his brother. So far he has had several stern talks with Fred that he shouldn't let me walk all over him, that my dreams didn't have to be his etc. Again, I am incredibly hurt and anxious. When I met Fred, nobody in his family cared about what he wanted. I remember when I asked him what his dreams were and he said that nobody had ever asked him that. I do believe that I want the best for us as a team. We discussed getting married, we discussed moving... we make decisions together. So I don't think I'm the controlling she-devil that Peter sees in me. I know he is protective of Fred but this is really putting a strain on our relationship. 

Last night, Peter texted him complaining that he didn't want me there at a family dinner because I was too aggressive and never understand his jokes. We were both shocked and after some questioning, Peter couldn't name a single specific incident. I cried a lot because I feel targeted. Yes, I do sometimes speak up against Peter, when I disagree with something he says (eg when he makes jokes about my country). But I never once raised my voice or insulted him. We believe that he can't handle that a woman is standing up for herself (his own gf is very submissive and only speaks when he asks her to... it's quite shocking to see). 

Anyways, Fred went to the family dinner and I stayed home. He promised he'd talk to Peter and stand up for me. What should I do now? How should I react if he didn't talk to him or if he allowed Peter to talk baldy about me again (which I think will be the case)? How can I acknowledge that I feel for him because of the anxiety but that he needs to put his foot down? His family is not supportive of any 'conflict' and believes that the younger siblings must respect (=completely submit to) the older siblings.

Well it's been three weeks, and a lot has happened. First of all, thank you to everyone that took the time to read and respond. I sat him down the day after making that post, and I broke up with him. He was devastated. Didn't see it coming at all (even though I had said we should wait to live together, and we'd had a discussion about me being unhappy.) 

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't cry. I wasn't even that upset. I think tells me that I was getting over the relationship slowly, and had known for a while that it wasn't meant to be. I mentioned the trip situation, as well as the different sex drives, and some other reasons. 

&amp;nbsp;

He asked if there was anything he could say or do and I said no. I was very nice to him, but very firm that it was over between us. I left that evening and we met up a week later to talk at his request. We have some friend overlap, so I thought it might be best. 

&amp;nbsp;


He told me he never thought I would leave. It never even crossed his mind that I would ever be frustrated enough to go. He said that several times. That he always thought there was ""always tomorrow"" to make things better. That was odd to me, I mean, we'd had like 5-6 conversations over the two years with me saying ""Hey, I am not feeling loved and I am not feeling fulfilled here."" Here is where it gets bizarre. He told me that the reason he hadn't wanted to hang two nights in a row ever, and just did his own thing, and never wanted to grocery shop together or go do things was that he was PREPARING for moving in together (FOR A FULL YEAR) by getting in as much ""bachelor time as he could."" I asked if this was a conscious decision and he said yes. That just blows my mind. I asked him if he thought making the relationship weaker made sense for me to want to move in with him. He said ""well when you put it like that, no."" 

&amp;nbsp;


R/Relationships, I'm baffled. I don't know whether to believe that explanation or not but it really doesn't matter. It just affirmed I made the right decision, something I have not doubted for a second. Of course now he's all chatty cathy and trying to show me he cares but I told him we need to not talk anymore. There is literally nothing he could do that could change my mind. I told him that an effort after a breakup feels hollow to me, that I don't want a foundation like that for my relationship. That actions taken after a breakup are typically just to reduce pain, they aren't real change. That if he had wanted to hang more with me, or initiate sex with me, etc he would have especially after many conversations. 

&amp;nbsp;


Oh and the low sex drive thing. Turns out he is addicted to pornography. He was lying about it the entire time. I never knew because we didn't spend enough time together for me to understand, and I of course never checked his stuff so I had no clue. Usually I am intuitive, but I trusted him when he would turn me down after I was gone on a 7 day trip that it wasn't because he had done things a bunch. The fact that he was lying about it and chose to do it over see me...it's so disappointing but I know I can do a lot better. He told me he would think about me and want me, but it was just ""easier"" to do things himself rather than call me up. I told him numerous times I would love to spontaneously come over (it's a fifteen minute drive.) And he never once took me up on that. I am not going to let it make me feel badly about myself though. I know there have been people in the past that really enjoyed sex with me and there will be someone in the future. I am over it. He told me that it ""wouldn't be an issue"" if we got back together. That is insulting because either he just wasn't interested in sex with me, but suddenly is if it means we can get back together, or he was just lazy about it or something. I don't know which is worse. 

He said he feels like he made the biggest mistake of his life. I knew he didn't have a lot of relationship experience but damn. 29 seems like a tough age to learn this particular life lesson, to value what you have and not take it for granted. 
  
&amp;nbsp;


Ps I am on the trip now with my family, and having an absolute blast. Not one ounce of me has missed him or wished he were here.

"Stepmom(45F) acts like I'm(19F) the ""other woman""


A little background: I am 19 years old, and I'm away from home attending college. I'm really close with my Dad and two younger sisters. My parents are divorced and my dad remarried my stepmom about 7 years ago. 

Anyway, I don't know what it is, but my stepmom has never made an effort to get to know me. It might have something to do with the fact that when my dad was still married to my mom, he cheated on her with now-stepmom. Long story short, I found out, and sent stepmom a really mean email. But, it was a mean email coming from an immature 8 year old, who didn't understand the complexity of the situation. But I feel like it would be really unfair to write me off because of something I did when I was 8. I digress. 

Continuing on, due to my biological mother's mental health issues, I was not a part of my dad's life until I was 15. When I was reunited with him, I was genuinely excited to meet his wife and my half brother. I was hoping she could be a mother figure, or even just my friend. I've tried really hard to make this happen too. I buy and make her gifts during the holidays, I try and get her to do stuff with me, and I have tried to tell her directly that I want a relationship. 

But she still does not like me. She barely speaks to me. Every time I see her, she acts like everyone wants to get rid of her, despite everyone reassuring her that we want her around. She will often just leave the house with my brother whenever I am around, I think to make my dad feel bad about her perceived victimization. 

She will also say passive aggressive things that imply she is a perpetual victim. For example, I was visiting my dad for the 4th of July. She was planning on leaving to go to her parent's house, so I asked her if she was going to stay for fireworks. She responded by saying she was going to leave the next day, but since I wanted her to go, she would leave immediately. We all begged her to stay, but she left anyway.

My biggest problem with her is that when my dad spends time with me, she acts like he is having an affair. She will call him and say things like ""Rowan(half-bro) and I are learning we can have fun without you, so just stay with missmolly314"" or ""I think you should just go to Mexico with just missmolly314 and her sisters instead of all of us like we planned"". She gets so jealous, and I just don't understand. I'm his daughter, not a stripper. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't feel welcome at my dad's house. My dad is a major pacifist, and he's aware there is an issue, but he doesn't really confront her about it. Knowing he is not much help, how should I resolve my issues with my stepmom? Should I be direct and tell her she is acting like a baby? Or should I just wait until their marriage falls apart (hint: their relationship is having serious issues because of all this and money issues)?

TL;DR: stepmom doesn't like me, no matter what I do. It's affecting my relationship with my dad, because she gets upset when I'm around.

EDIT: First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to this post. It made me realize that I'm not alone in this issue and that I'm not just imagining things. Per the suggestion of many of you, I have told my dad that this issue needs to be resolved if he wants a relationship. I suggested family therapy, and he is going to talk to her about that idea. If we can make progress, great. If not, it's going to become a painful and unnecessary her vs. me situation. 

Also, next time she starts the passive aggressive shit with me, I'm going to confront her about the way she is treating me. "
"My friends neighbour (36M) invited himself on our cottage trip. I (28F) now have to Un-Invite him.


Hi guys, Long time lurker, first time poster.

I am just looking to get some outside perspective on this. 

My best friend (BFF) has a neighbour, Steve (36M). My friend has young kids that play outside and thus she is often outside watching them and since Steve is unemployed, he is almost always out there as well. While Steve considers them VERY close friends, my BFF does not and once she moves away, they will no longer be in contact. Steve is not a terrible person but has a very grating personality. Always says the wrong thing, can be quite blatantly rude, etc. I try not to spend time around him and my husband very much dislikes him.

I dropped by my friends place a few weeks ago and Steve was outside hovering around, as always. Myself and my husband are renting a large cottage for a week in August and my BFF and her husband and kids are coming for a few days. My BFF is very excited so she mentioned this to me, in front of Steve. Steve then INVITED HIMSELF to the cottage, saying he had nothing to do that weekend. I did not say no as I was so completely caught off guard. I had absolutely no idea what to say, I find it very unfair that he would ask me that, I mean, we barely know each other!!!! (I later learned this is a very 'Steve' thing to do, he imposes on people and invites himself places all the time)

I told my husband about it later and he was a little ticked at me for not saying no right then and there but holy shit it was just really a shock to me, I had no idea what to say. I wish I could have thought of something at the time, but unfortunately I didn't.  

The bottom line is, Steve is someone who we do not get along with and we do not want them at our cottage vacation. My husband and I literally get one vacation a year and this is it. I'll be spending $800+food+ time off work for both my husband and I (neither of us get paid vacation time). This cottage is a big, expensive deal for us when you work in our lost wages and we want to spend it with our close friends. My BFF thinks we should just let him come and deal with it, but I know she's just dreading having to hear from Steve how sad he is that he's not coming. I get that and I feel bad about it but I'm pretty resolved that this has to be the outcome.

I absolutely know I'm going to come across as a jerk in all of this, and who knows maybe I am being one, but I need to let Steve down gently. All advice is much appreciated!!

My idea right now is to tell him that the owner has a strict limit of how many people can be at the cottage and we are over the limit. (I have had rentals where the owner stipulated this so it's not too far out)

 

TLDR: My best friends annoying neighbour invited himself to our once a year Cottage Trip. I have to let him down gently. Halp!"

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6oa8cj/i_27f_am_falling_for_an_asexual_friend_29m_who/

Thank you to those who responded to my initial post. After going through the replies it was clear to me that I was overlooking Jack's feelings and the fact that it must have taken him courage to tell me about his asexuality. I realized I was being selfish since he'd told me exactly what might happen if I overlooked it, and that happened exactly (as many of you pointed out). 

I still would have felt guilty if I didn't tell Jack about my feelings. So, over the weekend, I sent him a text asking to get coffee and chat. He seemed to know what was up - he asked me, ""is it about feelings?"" and I replied ""yes."" We met up that evening and I explained that I had started developing feelings for him, and that I thought we should spend some time apart, since we would be incompatible for a relationship. He shared that he had seen this coming, and that it seemed to happen a lot in his life - women would start off as friends but would get increasingly attracted to him. He told me that one time, he was groped (really, assaulted, but he didn't use that word) by an overzealous female friend and since then he had learned to catch on to those signals before it got too late. He had hoped that I would also just be a friend, but he said he understood that you can't control how feelings develop and that while it was sad, he'd also like to spend some time apart. 

We agreed that I would tell our mutual friend group minimal information but enough to keep them quiet about our separation. I went ahead and told them last night when we met for dinner. I explained that we are still friends but that I need to spend some time away to keep my feelings in check. They all seemed to understand and those who had been friends with Jack for a while exchanged knowing glances. Apparently this is a common issue (the fact that he looks like a fashion model doesn't help). 

One of our older friends, Susan (35-40? f) pulled me aside after dinner and said that Jack had called her afterwards and confided in her what had happened. She told me that he seemed to be very sad on the phone, but that he explicitly stated that it wasn't my fault - it was just the nature of who he is and who I am. She said that despite his maturity, good looks, and successful career, all of which would make him a catch, his love life is in shambles because he doesn't have interest in sex. I have to say that the conversation really opened my eyes - I hadn't ever considered that sex was so important to me, and most other women, until I realized that a man like him could face so much hardship due to his disinterest in it. Susan shared one other piece of advice with me: don't assume anything about anyone, unless they tell you directly; and, when they tell you something, respect it. That's definitely a lesson I will take to heart here.

All in all, I feel sad, but I can imagine that Jack feels broken. I only have to get over a crush - he has to accept that, once again, he's lost a friend to Cupid's arrow. Poor guy seemed destroyed after this incident, because we were really good friends. We got along perfectly. I can see why he said he gets little female platonic company. I'd like to be friends with him again some time, after I'm confident that the feelings won't get in the way of our friendship. But it will probably never be the same. 

Thank you, reddit, for helping me realize I was selfish in this situation. The outcome is far from perfect but it was necessary, and fortunately our friend group is understanding and hasn't cut off from either of us.

**TLDR: Talked to Jack, we decided to spend time apart. He's understandably sad. I learned about asexuality, maturity, and selfishness. Good life lessons - and no fairy tale ending.**"

"My [34M] youngest [3M] has a heart condition that requires a lot of medication. My brother [29M] is claiming it's cruel of us to parent him as if nothing is wrong.


My son has a heart condition he was diagnosed with. It is very stressful for my wife, daughters and I. The one bad thing is he's going to need a lot of medication for the rest of his life. The good news is that it's treatable with medication and surgery. It's not going to cut his life short with treatment.   

Last night my family and I went to my mothers house for her birthday. My son was trying to get another cup cake when he already had 1 of them for desert. Our daughters and son were allowed 1. He didn't listen to my wife and went back a second time after she already said no. She put him in a make shift time out chair for 10 minutes. She did nothing else to him. She tried to explain nicely to him why he couldn't have one. He ignored her and so she dealt with it. She took him by his hand and walked him to a chair. 

My brother then got on our case on how it's cruel to treat him like a normal kid. He said that we should give him special treatment because of his heart, and go easy on him. I told him to really mind his own business. He then said he would never be mean to his kid if she has a heart problem. He won't keep his nose out of our business.

"UPDATE: I [M/25] recently learned my father [50s M] is/was cheating on my mother [50s F]. I instantly went nuclear. Advice on my response/how to move forward with my family.


[Link here to original story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mf7be/i_m25_recently_learned_my_father_50s_m_iswas/)

TL;DR of Original: Learned that my Dad was cheating on my Mom, and immediately torpedoed his affair with some heartless manipulation. Feel guilty about what I've done and am struggling to see a path towards forgiving my father. 

***

Wanted to post an update since the OP got a decent amount of attention and the advice was really helpful!

Firstly, thanks to everyone who commented. I got some really reassuring advice, some challenging points of view that helped me be more introspective, and some rather flattering remarks about my quick thinking. Y'all really helped me feel in-control and added some context to my perspective, so thank you!

Since my post, a few things have happened. 

* My parents spoke as a pair to each of our family members individually (my siblings, but also my aunts &amp; uncles, grandparents, etc) to let them know about the divorce, the affair, and about what went down between me/my father/this other woman. 
* My family is pretty universally upset with my father. Not that I want everyone hating on him, but he did (at best) screw up royally and it's good to know that no one is choosing teams instead of acknowledging who did wrong. 
* My parents have both blocked this other woman from all phone lines/social media, etc. This is in part why the rest of the family was notified, so that they'd be aware if this woman tried to make contact. 
* After the above, we learned that this woman had attempted to contact my 17y.o. sister *24 hours before* the events of my OP. My sister missed the messages and didn't see them until after everything happened and was out in the open. 
* Still not speaking with my father, but have talked with other family about what's going on. 

As for how I'm feeling about the situation, any guilt that I had for what I did vanished the second I learned that this woman tried to contact my sister first. While my response was to tear this whole thing apart as quickly and effectively as I could, I cannot **imagine** what my poor little sister would have gone through if she'd had contact with this woman. I'm livid that she thought this was even remotely appropriate, and I'm livid that my father at any point thought this was a safe or stable person to involve himself with; therefore, I don't feel even a bit guilty about what I did any longer. 

I'm staying no-contact with my father until I sort through what I want to hear from him, and seeking counseling to talk through how my anger in this moment/at this situation is undoubtedly linked in all sorts of messy ways to my upbringing, etc. Crazy how hard it is to find a LPC with a &gt;3 month waiting list... but I'll get there!

Thanks again for the great comments on my OP. It really helped me judge which of my feelings were valid, and where I needed to cut myself a break. I think I'm in a better place now, but of course would love to hear any further advice/similar stories that y'all think might be helpful, or answer questions. Cheers!

  **tl;dr**: Family is handling the situation correctly though it is hard. Other woman is (1) definitely nuts and (2) completely cut off/out of the picture. I'm remaining no-contact and seeking counseling, but feel much better about what I did and where to go from here. "
"[32M]: My sister [35F] and her family moved in with our parents. She is now calling the shots on when my wife and I's children can go to grandparents' house, and no time seems like a good time.


Updated

My wife [31F] and I [32M] have lived within 5 minutes of my parents since we've been married (9 years). We now have 3 kids (2 boys, one infant daughter) My parents usually keep our boys on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. My sister, her husband, and 9 month old baby moved in with them 2 months ago, which happened to be a week after our 3rd child was born. They moved here from out of state to get a new start close to home. Educated people, had good jobs where they were but wanted to come back.

So right away, my sister said that Tuesdays and Thursdays are no good for our kids to go over there. She has to do teleconferences those evenings and needs ""total silence"" in the whole house. Turns out many other days are no good because they go to the gym, play soccer, and various other recreational activities. I can count on one hand the amount of times our kids have gotten to go over since they moved in over 2 months ago. My mom will offer to keep the kids only to back out because my sister can't have them over for one reason or another.

We talked to my parents before they moved in, worried about this very thing, and they assured us it wouldn't happen. My sister is a very controlling person. There has been a laundry list of times she has shit on us during times of our lives that should have been happy milestones.

Today I texted my sister asking if we could come up with some sort of compromise as to when our kids could go over there, and she basically said no to all my requests. My dad then called me telling me that my sister's family is in need right now and to stop pushing the issue, which I have only just confronted today. I don't get it. I would never move in and tell my parents their other grandkids aren't allowed over. I'd take my ass somewhere else to do my work if I needed silence.

I work 2 jobs, my wife works and takes online classes, we have 3 kids including a newborn and now our structured help (only 2 afternoons a week but precious time for us) is gone. Temporarily, but with no timeline.

Is this bullshit or are we being childish and insensitive?

TL;DR: My parents (our children's grandparents) used to have our kids over on a regular schedule. My sister and her family moved in with the grandparents, now my sister is determining when the kids can come over and no time seems to be a good time.

Edit: I'm a little late on this. Several people have asked why my mom can't come to our house and see our kids over here. She offered to once but it ended up not working out. We even said that she could bring my sister's kid over so my sister could work. She liked the idea. When I talked to my dad about it he said that's no good because he didn't want to ""change anything up."" He didn't give any other reasons as to why.

Also, I left out some back story that apparently would have been helpful. My sister's disrespect to my wife has been profound and in plain sight. My dad always basically tells us to deal with it to not shake things up. 

To name a few, my sister asked us to not name our second kid that name because she wanted the name. Dad said to comply. We named our kid the name anyway because he's our kid. Recently, we had the first granddaughter after 6 grandsons. We never flaunted that at all. At Christmas, when anyone would congratulate my wife, my sister would cut off the conversation and say ""look at my baby."" Then she last-minute moved in with my parents from another state the week my daughter was born. Also at Christmas, my sister, her husband and child, and the husbands parents moved in with my parents for 2 weeks and basically made the house off limits for any time but family gathering time. That's like a drop in the bucket for how toxic she has been in our lives but hopefully can shed some light on the current situation.

Update: I just want to say thank you so much for all of the thoughtful replies and PMs. My wife and I have taken them all to heart and I am blown away by the support shown here. I feel equipped with some fantastic advice to move forward in this situation."
"My [33f] wife's spending habits are becoming such a problem for me [35m] that I'm considering a seperation.


Married 5 years, together for 15.

My wife makes twice as much money as I do, but is always broke and asking me to make up the difference. We're up to our eyes in debt, which I've been trying in vain to make our number one financial priority. Despite having effectively zero disposable income, she's constantly throwing away hundreds of dollars on things we really don't need. Its just so frustrating when my clothes are falling apart and she's buying new furniture.

We've agreed to a scale system, so I don't pay half of our combined bills, but I'm still giving her $500- $600 a month. I might be able to manage half, but she will just spend herself back to zero. I gave up on keeping a budget long ago because I have no money to keep track of, and she won't stick to one. I tried the trick of putting her credit cards in the freezer, but she just thawed them out without telling me when she wanted to go buy things.

I told her today that I wasn't going to give her money she's been asking for to pay for a dog training class (we've already put the dog through one and stopped home training after that). She wants him in this class so we can prep him for getting *another* dog that we cant afford. I've been livid all day about the situation.

I'm getting to the point of looking at rentals on CL because this is affecting our marriage so badly that I'm considering leaving. I've also considered counseling, but if it's going to cost me anything then I'm SOL.

TL;DR How do I curb my wife's compulsive spending before it destroys our marriage?

EDIT: I hope I haven't given the impression that my wife is some callous, high-maintenance golddigger. She really is a saint, just one with very poor financial sense. She knows this is a problem, but like with all compulsions/addictions it's not something you can just switch off.

EDIT2: Or the impression that I'm wholly innocent in the situation. A good chunk of our older debts are a result of problems I've had in the past maintaining steady employment. Granted, it was also during the ""financial crisis"" so jobs weren't exactly plentiful, but I wasn't overly proactive in seeking them, either. It's just becoming increasingly frustrating that I've been working so hard these last few years to do my part and we're still just as broke as when I was unemployed. "
"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 1.5 years, his white knight tendencies are causing problems


[removed]"
"I [19F] am being excluded from our gaming group. I decide to find a new group. Boyfriend [20M] is the one upset.


I am in a gaming group that has about 10 members (18-25F/M), including my boyfriend and I. A month ago, I had a fallout with a member in the group, who I'll call R (25M). Basically, I don't like R. All he ever does is degrade and talk about are women who are ""back-stabbing bitches who you can never trust"" and how much he loves to smoke weed and do drugs. Hearing those things constantly became a drag, so I decided that I did not want to around him anymore.

Ever since I cut off contact, I've been excluded from games whenever R plays because he does not want me there. Even my boyfriend told me not to join because it'll piss off R. Obviously, I don't want to play with R either so this is fine with me. The thing is, when R is playing, I'm excluded from the group as I can't play with anyone else, because they're all playing with R. This happens 3/4 days every week, and they play for 5-6 hours a day. 

I'm really shy, so I don't talk much in the group games besides doing the usual callouts. I know everyone would much rather play with R than me since he's more outgoing and fun to them, so I don't interfere. Even so, I still feel like shit for being left out constantly. My boyfriend didn't even defend me the first time I was excluded. He just told me to not join ever again and left it at that. Only one other person in the group has defending me, and that is my best friend (19M) since middle-school. When I first told him about the situation, he got really angry and asked me if I wanted him to stop playing with R too. I know my boyfriend and best friend love playing with R though, so I didn't ask them to stop.

Last night, R and the group were all playing again. I decided to look for some other groups online to play with, because being alone sucks. While on a break from his game, my boyfriend asked what I was doing. I told him casually that I was looking for a new gaming group to play with. His reaction was not what I was expecting. He got upset and kept questioning me why I wanted to leave our old gaming group. I told him since I'm being excluded from our old group so often, I may as well find a new group to play with because I obviously don't fit in anymore. Even after my answers, he would keep asking me why I couldn't just stay and participate in the group often. How am I suppose to participate in a group when I'm being excluded from it weekly? 

At that point, I told my boyfriend to stop talking to me about this subject and to leave it. He then said to me that I was overreacting to being excluded from the group and then went on a rant about why I couldn't just be happy for once since he still plays with me daily. My boyfriend and I do play daily, but we play alone with just us two since no one else in the group can play at the times we're online. Being excluded from playing with everyone else is what makes me feel like shit, not being excluded from playing with my boyfriend. I told him that if I find a new group, I would always play with him first, no matter what. However, I just want to find a new group to play with when he and everyone else are playing with R since I can't join in the first place, and playing alone sucks. He said fine in an annoyed tone, and we left it at that.

We haven't spoken about it since, but I can tell he's upset over it. Am I really overreacting to the situation? Do I just ignore my boyfriend for now? Do I say something? This is the first time I've ever seen him so upset over something I did. I'm not sure what to do.

"[Update] I [30/F] have been feeling insecure about my performance at work these past two weeks due to various events and my anxiety and tomorrow I have to do a presentation to all the office. I'm scared I'll have a panic attack and I don't know if it should be good to talk to my boss [32?/M]about it


Hi hi Reddit! Yesterday I came to you asking for help for my presentation at work. Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6olwzm/i_30f_have_been_feeling_insecure_about_my/) for more details!

Honestly, your comments helped me a lot! And for some reason the ones telling me that I wasn't suited for my job, telling me to quit and to hide my worries to my boss striked a cord in me. As I was reading I was thinking ""Wait a minute, this is not the situation at all!"" and made me focus on the good things I've done in my work and all the situations where I had a problem and my boss have been nothing but helpful without judging. I just had some bad weeks, and I'm still learning.  I guess my stuborness did me some good, haha

I want to thank also the beautiful people who provided support, experiences, and suggestions for my anxiety. Just reading them made me feel so at ease!

Sadly between reading your comments and the nervousness I couldn't have a single hour of sleep! None! I don't know why, but I tried to close my eyes but it was imposible. Time passed very fast and was morning already. I felt like the day increased a difficulty level in me because I didn't feel rested at all, but I said ""Fuck it, let's do this zombie style!"".

So, I got up and prepared, I used my make up in my best abilities to hide the bags in my eyes and I left for the office. We have flexible work hours but my boss arrives very early, and my intention was talking to him at first hour.

I got to the office and he was the one who opened the door and the first thing I said was that I wanted to talk to him about something. I told him that I was feeling very nervous about the presentation, that at first I wasn't sure that I was able to do it but yesterday I read things on the Internet (I don't think he heard that as I asked a bunch of online strangers) that made me feel better about the issue.

He probed a little about my reasons to feel nervous. I told him that I was feeling stressed and I felt vulnerable when I had to speak in front of other people. I compared the situation of playing a game and trying to beat a Lv 10 boss with my Lv 1 Warrior. I felt that it was very overwhelming to me.

He listened very carefully and told me ""Alright, but what would happen if the Lv 1 Warrior has friends of higher levels and play with him?"" I answered ""Well, the warrior would level up more easily"". He really emphasized the need for the more experimented members of team to help the newcomers and he told me that I should see the office as a safe space where I didn't feel vulnerable since everyone would be helping me during my talk.

We started rehesal my presentation. At first I kept forgetting things and babbling and he gave me feedback, especially with my language because I couldn't use technical words since the whole office would be present. I didn't have the chance to practice the whole presentation but I already felt way more relaxed though the day. It also helped that he invited the team pizzas celebrating the fixing of some critical bugs :)

The presentation was ok. Everyone gave feedback about the things I talked about and my boss and my other team members made additional comments when necessary. When I was talking I felt like my voice was shaky and quiet, but my boss told me I was perfect. So, there's that! Incredible how distressed I was about this whole thing. 

And the best thing was at the end of the day, that my boss made the team play Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes (google it! It's a cooperative game about deactivating bombs). We got some good lessons about teamwork. Next week we will play Left 4 Dead :D

Well, sorry for the wall of text, it seems that everything is going good and I'm confident the bad weeks are behind... for now! I learned many things these days and I'm grateful for that.

Now I can't wait to go back home to sleep.

TLDR: Talked to boss, he's still the best, made a rehelsal of the presentation and everything turned out good even though I was in a zombie state. Also pizza and games at the office :)"

"I [27F] feel like I can make no real friends as an adult. Is this just what adulthood is like?


I grew up in a small town, with about 100,000 people. All of my best friends (who live scattered across the country) grew up with me in this town and our relationships are rock solid. I guess having those friendships (though not in close proximity) makes my current situation harder, because I know what it COULD be like. 

I moved to a large city four years ago for work. I had a roommate, my best friend, (who now lives across the country) and a boyfriend, so my time was monopolized. When my boyfriend and I broke up, I tried making friends at work, but it seemed like I was the only one calling or making plans, so I stopped trying. My roommate ran with a different crowd (they liked to party and I didn't), so her connections weren't people I was interested in hanging out with. 

Over the last several years, I've managed to make ""friends,"" but they never last long. Our friendships feel shallow and boring compared to the connection I have with my friends from back home. I do have one friend that I spend a lot of time with, but I'm worried that our relationship is shallow because all we ever talk about are our interactions with men, and nothing else. She also has some of the same characteristics that I don't like about myself, and I find myself annoyed with her more often than not. I care about her and want to maintain our friendship, so I try very hard to accept her for who she is and work on deepening our relationship. She is a very good person and I do feel lucky to have her around, despite my annoyance.  

I realize that as a twenty-seven year old woman, most of the people I know will either be in serious relationships or married. Lots of the people I know in my city grew up here, and their social circle has been together for decades. I'm not in a serious relationship and do not feel like I will be in one in the foreseeable future. 

I considered for a while that I was the problem, since I kept trying to make friends and it never worked. I can be very selfish, often dramatic, abrupt, and pretentious. I have a hard time giving control to other people. Over the last few years, I've worked hard to become a kinder person, who is less reactive and more open to suggestions of others. Still no luck. Is it normal to have a hard time making real friends as an adult? Are my expectations too high and this is just what adulthood is like? 

TL;DR: I moved to a new city and four years later, still don't have connections like I do with my friends from back home. I don't have a boyfriend and spend a ton of time alone with my dog. Is this just what adulthood is like? I want to be content and happy with my life, but I miss my friends and I'm lonely. 

**Edit: Thank you guys for all of your responses. I read every single one, even if I didn't respond to it. I'm glad to know I'm not alone, but there is also a lot of great advice in this thread that I plan on putting to use immediately. Also, I have been informed that 100,000 people is NOT a small town. I just knew a lot of people so I guess it felt smaller to me. Would a better term be small city? Lastly, I am confused by some of your comments regarding my character. I mentioned my character flaws to point out that I am actively working to fix them. No one is perfect, but at least I'm self-aware.** "

In my opinion, this is all truly psychotic and my girlfriend has SERIOUS issues but a part of me is giving her the benefit of the doubt.. and so I've come to Reddit to ask for your opinions and advice. Yes, you read the title correctly. The antagonist of my girlfriend's story is a TEN year old girl.

I recently began working for a friend of my dad's, Kris, and he is an amazing boss. He's super friendly, genuinely nice and we have a great time working together (it's just us two atm). He owns a company that is built pretty much next to his sister's house and so whilst his wife is at work he brings his daughter to work with him and his sister takes care of them for the day whilst he works right next door.

His daughter is ten years old, and she's adorable. I'm not a weird person, please don't think this like my girlfriend did.. she's just a cute kid. I was telling my girlfriend how Kris thinks she's got a crush on me and how I think it's really sweet because every time I walk past her whilst at my boss' sister's house, she begins to try get my attention by modelling and posing and showing me her new bags/shoes. Kris and his sister think it's hilarious and we all laugh about it. I talk to her, obviously, but it's just normal adult-child conversation. I know I'm probably making myself sound more suspicious by having to state that nothing is sinister.. but it feels like my girlfriend immediately assumed that of me when I told her.

She freaked out a little, telling me she doesn't like how this kid has a crush on her man and how I PROBABLY ENJOY IT? I said it was sweet, she's ten.. every ten year old has a crush but in no way do I enjoy it. I didn't even feel like I needed to mention that to her because it's so obvious! Anyway, she's said she's worried if I continue working with Kris eventually the girl will get older and somehow we're going to fall in love and run away together.

Please, Reddit.. please tell me this is way out of line? Have I seriously done anything wrong at all? I feel like if I had Kris would have beaten the shit out of me by now but I feel even disgusting speaking about the subject. This is obviously 100% innocent yet she's making me feel like a freak. It's a CHILD'S CRUSH.

I don't know what to do or say. I honestly believe she's troubled with something to assume I'm going to wait ten years for this girl to grow up and then fall in love with her.. especially when it's all stemmed because she grabbed a purse and started modelling it off. It was all a laugh, she's a child and we all found it hilarious. Seriously, I don't see the big deal.

But I still want an outsider's perspective. I need you guys and your opinions and advice. Please just give me any thought you have on the subject, me and my girlfriend both need to hear it. Thank you in advance.


tldr - my boss' ten year old daughter has a crush on me and tries to get my attention whilst at work.. girlfriend is now worried I'll someday fall in love with her when she's old enough if I continue working for my boss... I think she's insane, but I also want an outsider's perspective."
"Me (20F) with my Mom and Step-Dad (59F/60M), they won't invite me to family outings anymore


Hey Reddit, I'm new to posting and I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any horrendous errors I make. 

Here's some background: I am an only child and a sophomore in college. My parents have been divorced since I was 6 and I don't really talk to my dad anymore because he's emotionally abusive and manipulative. I've always been very close to my mom. My stepdad (we'll call him ""Bill"") has been around since I was 8 or so, and he's been very accepting and caring towards me in general. I am very grateful for the help and support that my mom and Bill have given me throughout the years, and I recognize that they have done a lot for me and I go out of my way to always thank them and try to show my appreciation. 

Onto the issue: my mom and Bill are currently in the process of finishing up a cabin that they own by a lake. When I was still in high school, they would invite me to come with them during the summer to spend time with them. Now, like 3 years later, my parents still go to the cabin fairly often but they do not invite me anymore. I haven't seen in it about a year and a half, and the last time I was there was just in passing.

My parents have always gone on trips without me (usually to Arizona or Las Vegas) and I've always understood that they need their time to be by themselves and enjoy being adults without worrying about me. But recently they've been going a lot more, like last summer they went on a two week vacation to Hawaii with my extended family and didn't invite me. This year they went to San Francisco and San Diego for a week with extended family and didn't invite me. 

I completely understand that my parents are under no obligation to take me places and I really do not mean to sound like a brat, but it just makes me upset to not even be invited. Especially on trips where my extended family goes too, or to the cabin which is big enough to have me stay too and used to be a family-spot. I've even offered to drive myself to the cabin and meet them or pay my own way on trips, but they've never wanted me to. It makes me feel like I am no longer included in the family. 

I talked to my mom about it last night and she said that ""because I'm an adult now, they have no reason to invite me to things. I am in college and working my own job, and that all must mean I'm independent from them."" My mom also said that ""she doesn't understand why I'm not upset that my dad doesn't ever want to do anything with me (and I WAS upset about that growing up. It took years of therapy to feel okay, and she knows that), and that if my dad doesn't have to invite me to things then she doesn't understand why she and Bill have to either.""

So my question is, where do I go from here? Do I try to talk to her about it again today and clarify how I'm feeling? Do I just move on and start distancing myself? Is this a problem that other people have faced? How did you handle it? Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. 

TLDR; parents have stopped inviting me on family trips, say it's because I'm an adult and if my abusive father doesn't have to invite me to things then they don't think they need to either. What do I do now?"
"My [24F] friends staged an intervention to tell me my boyfriend [27M] is abusive and they can no longer stand by. I still don't know what to think.


Help me out, r/relationships. I live in a foreign city with my boyfriend with a few friends here and far away from my family. I need an outsiders' perspective on this all. 

So last Sunday 4 of my friends took me to one of their homes and sat me down to say that they all think I've been in an abusive relationship of 1 year. Right now I'm caught because I feel like they're half right half wrong. 

Their arguments are that they've seen my boyfriend when he's been really angry at me, and they say the stuff he says/way he treats me is beyond the pale of a normal ""angry partner."" They said that my boyfriend say things to me that no one should say to anyone ever, and I get upset and nearly non-functioning when it's happening. But their biggest argument is that my boyfriend will always apologize after a week of verbal torture so as to drag me back on his side. 

The truth is my boyfriend has had major anger blowouts maybe 2 times in the past year. One time he got mad because he thought I lied to him about my romantic past, and he accused me of sleeping with one of his friends. The truth was I did go on a date with this friend, but we never slept together and this was way before I met my boyfriend. Anyways he blew up and called me names and told me really hurtful things like I'm a ""worthless partner"" and this is why he'll ""never love me"" and things like that. Like really deeply hurtful things that weren't just part of the argument. So during that time I had my friends as my only support. They saw me at my worst, when I couldn't eat and I was crying and throwing up from all the anxiety. They also read all the texts my bf sent me, the really bad ones, and were shocked at how incredibly cruel they were. At the end of the week, my bf called me and gave a really long apology. It turned out he had a friend at his ear who was telling him all these terrible things about me and getting him riled up. He told me he finally saw the light and was so so so sorry he put me through all this and he still wanted us to work things out. I agreed because it made sense to me. I couldn't recognize him when he was that angry and it was such a relief to have the old-him back. I was still hurt, but he took time to talk to me and make me feel better. 

So the next time something like this happened was maybe 6 months later. I won't get into why he got so mad, but we were long-distance at the time and he blocked me on all social media for 48 hours. Since we were LDR, I had absolutely no way to contact him and was convinced we were done. He just told me he was dumping me and promptly blocked me. I couldn't go to work for those 2 days and had the same friends around to comfort me. After the block, he went on the same kind of path and said a lot of hurtful things like how our entire relationship meant nothing to him and that he was sorry he ever met me, etc. At the end we reconciled and he told me it was the stress of the business trip that set him off and he promised to keep his anger under control and to never, ever say these things to me ever again. 
 
These were the only two instances stretched over nearly a year of dating. My friends have told me that these were still 2 times too many, but I am really caught on the fence. To give credit to my boyfriend, he has sincerely apologized after each time and took steps to comfort me and repair my feelings. However, my friends are convinced that he has absolutely no respect for me. They pointed out a lot of other small things they've noticed where they said he makes small ultimatums to me to make me do the things he want. Like he threatens to break up with me if we don't go somewhere for vacation, or see certain friends, or do certain things. I don't really remember these instances well, but my friends apparently do and they are livid about it. 

I know all of this puts my boyfriend in a terrible light, but it's hard to convey over text what a wonderful person he can be as well. How loving and kind and absolutely sensitive he is when my friends aren't around. How our personalities and interests click so perfectly in a way I've NEVER had with anyone else ever. We have had so many good memories and time together that it feels like a waste to throw all of that away over a few days of roughness when he wasn't even himself. I've always thought that this was the man I wanted to marry. Anyways, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I need an outsiders perspective on this. Preferably someone who has/is in a similar relationship to mine.

  **tl;dr**: My friends told me my bf is abusive for two times in the past year when he's been inconsolably angry and said some hurtful things to me. I feel conflicted because I feel like my friends don't see the whole picture, only the bad times. Is he really abusive? Are there signs here of abuse??"

"My [24] parents [50; 57] don't want me to move out because ""I'm not done cooking,"" but I want out.


Hello, /r/relationships. I apologize in advanced for the length.

Sorry if this is a long ramble, I don't know how to put this in a narrative.

So i have generalized anxiety disorder which disrupted a lot of my life, and naturally, my parents are extremely protective of me. I would get panic attacks, go through extremely bad relationships, and worry over nonsensical things. They've told me all my life to not worry about getting a job and to just let them pay for things. 

I would feel pretty guilty about this, especially since my parents were always giving money to my bio dad to take care of my severely autistic bother, and to my older sister who has a kid and has terrible money issues of her own from her own screw ups (she crashes cars, got fired from work all the time, and more.) So every chance I got, I would try to get a job. But my parents would always talk me out of it saying I'm not worried and that they would take care of it. I was in high school, so I didn't have much free time anyway. 

This was fine as a teenager but now I'm 23. I'm constantly driving between campuses and my internship, while also living an active social life and participating in the speech/debate team which gives me a grant that covers half the tuition. I make straight A's despite any trouble I run into, and just today found out that since I turn 24 in September, I qualify for a pell grant that will cover my tuition. Not to mentioned I am only 6 classes away from graduating with my BA! My anxiety is also ten times better, and I feel extremely accomplished. Even my speech coaches have told me they're so proud of how far I've come.

But every summer during my college years I would try to find a job and my parents would make me quit. I only succeeded in keeping one job at a retail store, and they decided to push me to babysitting my brother so much I had to quit for ""the family."" After I quit my babysitting duties suspiciously subsided. I am only allowed 200 dollars a month for food expenses and gas, and since I go to school everyday back and forth in-between my internship, this isn't enough to sustain myself. I tried to bargain for more, they say I need to budget. I offer to get a job, they say absolutely not.

Thing is, this is my last year. My tuition is being paid for myself and I only take three classes a semester now. This would be perfect to get a job to save up some money and to move out and transition to true independence. I also have an amazing, loving boyfriend who wants to take the next step and have me move in with him. I'm delighted but my parents 100% do not approve, despite him being so polite and making so much effort to get to know them (he bought my little brother two expensive transformers toys and didn't receive any thank you from them at all, much less bothered to even talk to him).

I feel so discouraged. I tried hinting that I want to leave but they keep saying weird stuff like ""you're not done cooking yet,"" and how I need to focus on my studies. Well I've been focusing on my studies and obviously they are fine. When I told my (step) dad about potentially having good news about my Grant money, he immediately berated me: ""No, you're not moving out."" Even though I wasn't even going to TALK about it.

They put a lot of pressure on me to do impromptu milk runs in the middle of the night, to take care of my brother while they go out. They say I can come and go as I please, but demand me to text me where I am through out the day and make extremely snide remarks on how I practically live at my boyfriends even though they establish that it was supposed to be absolutely fine.

I'm getting sick of living here. I get berated for hanging my bath towel in the ""incorrect"" towel rack, have to stop at home to do the dishes between school and my internship even though I'm barely home enough to do the dishes anyway, and I get fussed at for not being home but when I AM at home they don't even acknowledge my existence unless they need something. I'm so tired of them seeing all my anxieties as me not being ready, and not seeing the strides I could make on my own.

But I'm still conflicted. I don't want to lose them, I just want to move out and live my life freely and develop responsibility. I feel weird that they aren't even letting me do that. I don't feel like I'm even home here anymore. 

tl;dr: despite me being responsible, straight a, productive student with grant money to pay for tuition, parents still won't let me out and I feel trapped. 


Edit: Wow! I never imagined my post would get this big! I am extremely grateful for the advice and constructive criticism. I do think my parents have slight narcissism issues, but ultimately in their weird way they seem to think they are doing the best by me while also taking extreme advantage of the situation. I'm applying to multiple part time jobs, and have been for a while - but the advice everyone has given out has just reaffirmed that I MUST do this. Once I get a job and have a decent amount of income, I am going to let my mother know that I will move, and that she can't say anything to change my mind. I know she'll be pissed, and that my step dad will be enraged, but I suppose that's the cost of seeking happiness.

I might schedule a therapist appointment in the mean time with someone who is quite familiar with how my mother can be, and seek her advise as well. 

Thank you everyone again I truly appreciate the outside perspective!"

"My [24F] boyfriend [24M] of a year is so forgiving of people and accuses me of holding grudges.


My boyfriend Aaron is very forgiving of others, which in some ways is a good quality, but I think he takes it too far. I'm all for working things out and not cutting people off for petty things, but if someone is constantly causing me a problem, I don't see why I should be kind and helpful to them anymore. I don't get involved when I think my boyfriend is being too forgiving because it doesn't affect me and if Aaron wants to waste his time on someone who doesn't deserve it, that's his problem. But he argues with me when I don't do this and often accuses me of holding a grudge. Like when I quit a group I had been volunteering with, because I thought a lot of the people in charge were rude and disrespectful, and he said I should have stayed and tried to work it out with them. I'm not going to waste my time changing the culture of an organization when I'm not even required to be there. I found another group that does the same kind of work, so I feel like I solved the problem.

We got in a huge argument yesterday, because he was in the room when I got a phone call from a landlord about my ex-roommate, Angie, who had put my info down in her rental history. I can only assume she didn't think the landlord would actually check on this. Angie was a terrible person to live with. As an example, me politely asking her to clean up her dishes which had been sitting in the sink for three days turned into a huge fight where she got defensive and said that it wasn't her fault, and that I had left a dish out two months ago so I was a hypocrite, and she didn't say anything at the time because she was so nice. She yelled that it was so unfair, because I got home much earlier than she did, and that if I wasn't so lazy I could have just done them, and that I was an asshole for asking for more money in exchange for doing the chores because she had credit card debt to pay and wahhh wahhh wahhh. This was pretty typical of Angie, and I became very stressed out, never knowing what would set off a fight.

If the person who called me had been someone renting out a whole apartment, I would have just said Angie paid her rent on time and didn't trash the place, but the woman was renting out a room in her house, so she would be actually living with my ex-roommate. So I told the whole truth, and when the woman asked if I would live with Angie again, I said absolutely not.

Aaron got very mad at me for doing this, and said it's okay not to want to live with Angie anymore, but that I shouldn't be sabotaging her chances of having a home somewhere else that had nothing to do with me. My argument is the woman asked me questions, and I answered. I didn't go on a smear campaign or make of stories about Angie to get her in trouble. If Angie ever expected me to help her with anything, she shouldn't have burned her bridge with me.

I'm tired of Aaron always getting on my case about why I didn't help this person, or why I won't visit this person, and how I hold grudges all the time, when most people would agree that my complaints about these people are reasonable. If he wants to be super forgiving that's on him, but how can I get him to back off when it's my problem?

"Me [30F] with my wife[30F], I think she is addicted to the internet and is about to lose her job over it


Yesterday was a final straw for my wife's internet usage and when I tried to make it a discussion, she became hysterical and wouldn't speak to me.

She told me that she's received her final warning for 'excessive internet usage' at work. I said to her ""final warning? how many have there been?"" Two or three times in the past year. She usually spends her time on facebook, tumblr, amazon, forums, twitter, etc. Things I can definitely understand an employer not wanting to pay her for. ""They don't give me enough work to do, and I told them that"". Great.

She is late to her job every morning, no matter what her start time is. When she had a start time of 8am, she'd show up at 8:20. Her boss ended up changing her start time to just be at 8:15 am for her (very nice of him) but then she was just coming in at 8:30 or 8:45. Last month they changed her start time to 9am. I leave the house for work at 7 usually, so I assumed she was easily making it in by 9. Last week I was ill and worked remotely and saw that no-- she wasn't even leaving the house until her shift was about to begin. No matter what her start time is at her job, she's late.

Why is she late, you ask? Well, it's only a 20m drive so distance and traffic isn't the reason. Every morning, as soon as she blinks herself awake, she reaches to the nightstand for her cellphone. Facebook is usually the first thing she goes to. I'll say to her 'hey put the phone down and get ready' and she'll say ""this is my routine, this is my routine, i have to do it"". The problem is she'll lay in bed on her phone/Facebook for an hour or more every morning. By the time she puts the phone away, she's supposed to start her shift in 20 minutes and she hasn't even gotten out of bed or showered yet.

The addiction is now affecting our relationship. Can't even talk to her hardly anymore. She comes home from work, out comes the phone. I'll ask her a question 2, 3, 4, 5, times, and she never responds. It's like she's on another planet. If we try to watch a show? She's on her phone the whole time too, playing games or reading posts. I've begun to feel like an echo in my own home, almost like I live alone. I can't even remember the last time she wasn't staring at her screen and it's been getting so much worse. 

Other than the phone usage, our relationship is good. We love each other dearly, care about each other immensely, and typically almost never argue. Now all of our arguments stem from me asking her to put the phone/internet down.

I've suggested she sees a therapist (many times) for her depression. She always agrees but never follows through. Last night I suggested ""Why don't we deem 8pm-9pm for Social Media Time"" and leave our phones away the rest of the evening. She was immediately incensed and snapped, ""That's NOT going to help my depression."" Her instant defensiveness is an obvious red flag that this is an addiction issue. 

Any time I try to talk to her about this, she breaks down into hysterics or gets extremely mean towards me. I've tried multiple approaches, ranging from ""I'm concerned for you"" to ""I'm worried about me"" to ""How can we realistically plan to raise a child if you can't even get to work on time like the rest of the world?"" 

I don't want to resent her but I'm starting to. Also to make note, she does fall on the autistic spectrum, which she employs often when I confront her (""I'm an aspie, i need my routine and can't possibly change it"" or ""I'm an aspie, I'm always late and that's never changing""). I'm trying to be understanding of mental limitations but these seem like problems that some simple time management could resolve. 

What do I do? I feel like a stranger in my own home with my own wife, I'm terrified she will lose her job and she doesn't seem to care about keeping it, and I can't support us both on my income. Am I being insensitive like she claims? I don't want to be a bad wife, but I'm genuinely afraid this addiction is going to ruin her life and mine with it.

"I'm pregnant and so is the other woman


Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I don't even know where to begin-my life has become something you only see on the Lifetime channel. 

Background: I (33F) have been with my husband (35M) for 6 years. I have a daughter (8F) that he's been stepdad to that entire time. Thought everything was great. Never fought, didn't disagree on finances or life goals or parenting. We were the couple that made others cringe with our love. This all came as a complete shock to me and it happened right after he was laid off from his job. 

A few months ago, my husband admitted depression and left me for another woman who he had been having an emotional affair with for a month (24F) who happened to also be a coworker and someone I knew on a personal level before he did. Moved in with her immediately after starting therapy even though I was pregnant with his child. Went to a few sessions and stopped. I dealt with that as best I could, with him still supporting us financially and me not completely losing my shit as I understand mental health issues quite well and felt a lot of empathy for what he was going through. 

Things have been...okay. We don't talk much but he pays the bills and sees our daughter occasionally. That is until this latest bomb. He's gotten the other woman pregnant. Cue me completely losing my cool in hormonal devastation. I don't even know how to react or think or move forward at this point. I cannot work due to this very high risk pregnancy as well as health issues of my own. I haven't worked in almost a year which before all this happened, was a mutual decision and a necessity for my health. 

I don't even know where to go from here. Two babies will be born very close together and the logistics of that have my mind running in an endless circle. How am I supposed to explain this to the daughter he barely sees since this other woman entered the picture? How am I supposed to deal with this emotionally? And how is he possibly going to deal with the realities of this situation when the babies come? How will he possibly be able to spend time with our children when he has another one in another city with another woman? 

I feel utterly replaced. I feel my child and unborn child have been replaced. I feel...invisible now. He says he wants to still be involved but neither of us know how to make that work. I can't even look at him right now. The kicker is, almost no one knows we even separated months ago. Divorce isn't an option yet since my child and I would lose our health insurance and not qualifying for any sort of government aid (already spoke to a lawyer and social worker before the second pregnancy came out in the open). 

Thank you in advance for reading this hot mess. I don't even know what sort of advice I'm looking for. I mostly just had to get this off my chest. 

EDIT: my post is locked but I wanted to let each of you know (especially those that I was unable to reply to because of the lock), that I read each and every response and I am so grateful for the advice, support, and Internet hugs. I'm still in shock and it's going to be so hard moving forward, but I have taken all of these responses to heart. Thank you all so very much.

"Friend [22F] keeps on requesting to hang out with my boyfriend [22M] I'm [21F] feeling paranoid and territorial and I need help handling it appropriately.


Alright, so we'll call my friend Mandy. Never had trouble with Mandy before, but I've only been single while we've been friends. When we were single we'd club and hang out a lot together. Mandy is a casually dating right now but she's been having trouble finding men that want a calm monogamous relationship.

So, we all smoke. James (bf) And I smoke maybe twice a week. We typically do it together, and for some reason we usually have sex afterwards. I think this matters in the context of the story because Mandy knows this. (I recommended she try It with a guy she was with) It might not matter, but I'm paranoid, so I do think I'm kinda grasping at straws a bit.

So from square one Mandy thought James was a good guy. Liked his personality, commented that she found him attractive, basically that I ""got a good one."" I figured this was fine, this is just the whole ""my friends comment on my new guy"" thing. She's expressed jealousy a few times but nothing super weird or detailed, just that she wishes she'll meet a guy like him. I didn't think this way a big deal since I've said things like ""he's such a catch! I hope I meet someone like him"" in the past too.

Lately, if we hang out with Mandy, she comes out dressed similar to when we go to a bar as opposed to when she and I hang out alone. Like curled hair and a sexy outfit. Using her good makeup. But she's still in her jeans t shirt makeup free combo when her and I go out anywhere.

She's also been requesting to hang out with him one on one. For instance, I asked him to pick and and drop off a pizza for me and her on his way home. He said sure, and that he'd bring me a bottle of wine and some weed since I like the boozy-high pizza eating experience. So I told Mandy this and she got way over excited. Like, too excited. Jumping around. All of a sudden she wanted us to do each other's makeup for fun. And she took her hair out of the bun it was in.

So James drops off pizza and wine but apologizes because he forgot the weed. No big deal. Mandy made it a big deal. ""How could youuuu, I'm so disappointeddddd."" Now the voice thing is only how I've heard her speak to men. But in all fairness, from her dad to the mailman, all men get that tone &amp; voice from her. James kinda laughed it off and told her to feel blessed with the free wine and pizza.

So James leaves, and Mandy is still laughing about the situation and basically said ""he's so funny, give me his number!"" I was kinda monotone and I straight up asked for what? She said she wanted it so she could smoke with him later since he forgot the weed, in case I was busy when she was free. I laughed and said no (was this inappropriate/controlling of me? should I have spoken to James first?)  after I said no, she asked me why. I told her James is only free to smoke when I'm free. 😅 Which is, yknow, a lie. 

So the situation died out from there. No longer wanted to do each other's makeup and the hair went back up into a bun.

She's continued requesting to hang out as a trio and I'm kinda here playing gatekeeper now. So I feel like I could be paranoid because it's possible she doesn't want him! Maybe she literally just wants to smoke and I'm the crazy ass girlfriend. (i.e. for free since James would be generous since she's my friend.) Maybe shes just lonely and enjoys the vibe/dynamic we have! But I'm so paranoid and territorial now. I notice dumb shit like whether her hair is up or down and how much makeup she's put on now. It's unsettling haha.

So yeah. I need to have conversations with both James and Mandy since I feel like the goalie protecting James from Mandy. I love Mandy, we've had a bunch of great times. Shes been great until now. But she also can't have my man. BUT, I also don't want to be the crazy gf that's cutting off friends that she feels threatened by. 

Help me out please. I need a calm cool way to mske boundaries known while not causing any scenes.

Tl;dr: I think my friend wants my man. But I could be wrong. I don't want to throw away my friendship with her unless I really have to."

"UPDATE: I (M31) have been dating my best friend’s sister (F28) for 3.5 months, but I get confused on whether she is very reserved or just disinterested.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rizfz/i_m31_have_been_dating_my_best_friends_sister_f28/

Hello. As an avid reader, I have always appreciated updates so I figured I would provide one on my previous post (nothing that interesting however, sorry for the length).

My OP was at the 3.5 month mark. At 5 months, nothing had improved and had in fact deteriorated. 

I was scheduled to go on an out-of-state trip in the near future, and two weeks before said trip, Beth came over to my house. Admittedly, she was not feeling well and I appreciated the effort she had made to come over. However, she was quite distant, and she insisted that I “didn’t have to walk [her] to her car every time”. I told her it was no trouble, and she responded by saying “I’m a very independent woman, you can’t take that away from me.”
I was very taken aback. I told her I was not trying to do anything of the sort and it was just a common courtesy. We kissed goodnight and parted ways. Afterwords, our texts were brief, and I decided to stop initiating and wait until she reached out.

She went silent for a week. :(

At this point, the message was clear; she Just Wasn’t That Into Me, but didn’t want to be the one to break it off. I figured if that was the case it was kind of incumbent upon her to speak up, but I figured I’d go ahead and rip the band-aid off. So I went ahead and called and asked to swing by her place. I did so, and I basically broke down how I was feeling:

•	I really like her and think she’s awesome

•	That being said, I get the feeling I’m way more into her than she is into me

•	Regardless, my needs for passion, attention, and affection are not being met

•	The last thing I would want to do is ask her to be someone she’s not

•	Maybe we’re better off as friends

I presented this pretty matter of factly, and I assumed she would jump at the chance to break things off in a very amicable manner. Much to my surprise, she really protested. She said that she did like me and knew she had a problem with opening up, but that she was hoping to continue our relationship and that we could both have a chance to grow. I asked her about the comment she made the last time we saw each other, and she said she was joking. I told her I didn’t get it. I also said that regardless, if she is going to go a week without talking to me, then I (and I think 99% of guys) would see that as a sign of disinterest.

We talked about a lot of stuff (I was there for like three hours), but as for our relationship, we decided to keep seeing each other. I was going to take her at her word that she likes me and not jump to conclusions, and she was going to do a better job of being more demonstrative about her feelings.

Things were a bit better at first, but then it seemed like she was back to just being disinterested. Then, about a month after our big talk (so we had been dating for about 6 months at this point) we had another awkward goodbye followed by her not texting me for a week, something I had specifically told her I would interpret as disinterest. At this point, I decided I was a bit over having to initiate every single interaction, and that I didn’t really want to date someone who wasn’t excited to spend time with me. 

I spared us another drawn-out conversation like last time that clearly didn’t do anything, and broke it off by text. Maybe not the best way to do it, but at least I was willing to consider her feelings and talk to her at all. I told her that it was clear she was checked out, and not intending on even addressing the situation. I did acknowledge that my tone would come off as frustrated (because I was) but that I didn’t want there to be any hard feelings. She replied and said she wasn’t checked out and was intending to address things (when???), but she respected my opinion. She apologized for being preoccupied and making me feel upset and frustrated, and agreed we should remain on friendly terms.

So… that’s that. I’m far from being upset at this point, just a bit confused, ha ha. If she was over it, why not just break it off? And why fade out on someone you know you’re going to see again? It’s not like I’m just some random from Tinder or something. 

If she really wasn’t checked out, why would she act so distant, especially after our big talk? 

Whatever. It’s still a bit of a headscratcher but after the shit show that was my divorce, at least I can say I’ve been through a breakup that didn’t involve law enforcement! And like I said, I realize this isn't some big dramatic update, but I always appreciate them as a reader and I appreciate everyone who commented.

TL;DR: She kept being distant, and after a Come To Jesus Talk about it, she kept it up so I broke it off. Still a bit confused if she was really disinterested or we had different communication styles, but either way we’re not a good match.

"My (33M) brother (34M) has become distant over the last 2 years, my mom (62F) says I ""shoved my life in his face""


My brother and I are only 10 months apart and were inseparable growing up, we only started to drift apart when our lives took very different turns when I was 21. That's the year I moved across the country to go to grad school, while he knocked up and married his deadbeat ex. Despite the different directions of our lives, we remained in fairly regular contact and had a good (albeit less close) relationship for most of the next decade. Once a year I'd pay to fly him up individually to spend a weekend with me, and every alternating year his whole family would take a vacation here (I live in a very scenic part of the country). 

After I graduated I started working my way up in a large professional firm, and along the way met and married my wonderful wife (31F) who is in the same profession and also on the partner track. We each make &gt;6 figures per year and have been able to make a nice life for ourselves, aided by the fact that we have remained childfree thusfar (we may have one eventually, my wife would be making the bigger career sacrifice though so honestly that's up to her). He, on the other hand, married his ex, had another kid with her, and got stuck in the same small town we grew up in. She was always an issue (In 8 years never held a job for more than a couple months, and was always on/off the NA wagon) and he filed for divorce 3 years ago, shortly after which she got knocked up by her new boyfriend and ran off to god knows where, leaving him with their kids now ages (11F) (8M) and her daughter from a previous relationship (15F). He now lives with my mom (62F) in her house while she helps him raise the kids. 

The first summer after all of this happened I offered to fly him out to visit me for a weekend and my mom agreed to take care of his kids. I knew that year had been hard for him and I wanted to show him a good time. My wife and I don't live a very flashy lifestyle (I still drive the used Subaru I bought as an entry-level) but that year we both got promotions and decided to buy ourselves a cottage in the Rockies as our weekend getaway. It's a small and rustic place but it suits are purposes, perfect for hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter, and getting away from the city year round. It's also home to our marijuana garden (we live in a legal state) and reptile breeding operation, both of which are hobbies my brother and I were heavily into when we shared our first apartment a decade ago, but ones he had to give up on account of the kids and living with my mom. I thought he'd have a good time hiking, smoking, &amp;  interacting with the snakes, and while he was here he really seemed to! But ever since that trip when I've reached out to get him to come back he avoids the subject or comes up with lame and obviously false excuses. I've offered to fly not just him but he and all his family up to stay with us and he's declined. I've said we can stay in the cottage or the city and he's declined both. It's been bothering me that he seems to no longer want a relationship with me, he was the only family member left I felt close to since our dad has passed and my mom and I have a strained relationship on account of the moved across the country/haven't given her grandchildren thing. 

The other day I was talking on the phone to my mom and told her that it upset my he doesn't want to visit. She responded ""well maybe if you didn't go shoving your life in his face every time he visits he'd want to go more!"" I asked her what she meant by that and she said last time he came back he acted depressed for weeks and kept complaining about their town, his job, being a single parent, etc. She says being around me and spending time in my homes made him feel jealous, and subsequently guilty for feeling jealous, and that's why he doesn't visit anymore. 

I felt terrible when she told me that, I'd never meant to make him feel jealous I just wanted to show him a good time. He's never personally voiced these feelings to me and it's unlikely he ever will, so I don't know how to apologize or otherwise confront the problem directly. I do want to maintain a relationship with him though, he's a great person and brother and I admire him for putting his kids' needs above his own, which is more than I would have done in his shoes. I don't know how to talk to him about it though, because he hasn't voiced any problems to me personally. What should I do? 

Tl;Dr My mom told me my brother doesn't visit anymore because he's jealous of my lifestyle. How should I deal with this situation? "

"I [23f] resigned from my gas station job effective august 1. My boss seems to be hiding something regarding my resignation.


Hi everyone! 
This is kinda hard to explain so bear with me. For anonymity purposes I'll be changing the names of those involved :)

So I've been working at a gas station chain for about 3 months. My boss has been intolerable from the get go. She's talked negatively to me about my coworkers (going as far as calling them names), she's spent an entire shift crying in her office because her wages were being garnished (she told me this too) her husband is constantly at the store, even spending unsupervised time in her office and handling the cash box. I tolerated her odd behaviour until she took me into her office,  locked the door and screamed at me for being ""too quiet"" and ""taking my mood out on her."" At that point I began actively looking for new employment. 

I landed a super awesome job at the bank. Last Thursday,  I gave her my notice of resignation and said I would be done on August 1st. She was shocked but overall accepting. 

Yesterday she told me that unemployment contacted  our head office. She said they were confirming that she knew I was looking for employment and said I needed to finish 2 weeks to the date of me giving my notice. I immediately was confused as to why unemployment would be contacting them. I asked her for the contact info for the person she was talking too. She said she'd give it to me the next day (Today).

Today, she's avoided giving me the name by saying ""it was just an email saying you were looking for another job is all no worries."" I asked for her to forward me the email as I would like to understand why unemployment would be contacting anyone about me and she said she ""wasn't supposed to even tell me about the email and got in trouble for it."" 

Does this make any sense to anyone? I don't understand how she could've possibly got in trouble for it, how would any higher up people know she told me? Why would unemployment be contacting her? I want a resolution to this and I want to understand what is going on. Any advice would be really appreciated. 


Tldr: my boss is a loony tune and I don't know what to believe"
