"I [74F] haven't spoken to my children in 20 years. I'm dying now.


I realize I'm older than most here, if not all of you. But internet has been my best friend in old age and I frequent this subreddit regularly. 

I have two sons and a daughter (51, 50 and 44). I haven't talked to my sons in about 25 years and my daughter in 20 years. They chose to cut me off permanently and I respected their decision. With my history of mental illness they had every right to do that. I had problems with narcissistic personality disorder and anger which took many decades for me to overcome and I'm still fighting my demons to this day.

I'm living the final months of my life. I have terminal cancer and will soon be gone from this world. I promised them to respect their wishes and I have for 25 years but deep in my heart I do wish to see them again, maybe to apologize for one last time before I'm gone. I don't know if I am being selfish as I can also apologize in my will. I want to do what is best for them. Will they be interested in seeing me before I die? There are considerable assets that I have which I am leaving all of it to them so they will hear about my death. 

If you can provide some advice about my situation I will be grateful. You're all closer to my children or grandchildren's age and can see things from their eyes better than I can.

  **tl;dr**: I'm dying and have not spoken to my children in 25 years per their request. I am not sure if I should let them know that I'm dying.

I never expected so much advice and love from you. I thank you all and I'm reading everything to come to my final decision. "

I met Ray back when I was 18 years old. He was in a band that I absolutely loved, grew up with. I had even had a crush on him for soo long before we met. You can imagine how excited I was to be able to work with him.  I had a small part in working on one of his music videos way back when (interning at the production firm that he had hired with his band.) We soon started dating after that, pretty inseparable. I would always hang out with them at the studio and spend time with Ray in his place or mine just walking around stoned, happy, and in love. He basically coached me through both my undergraduate and MFA. Three years ago, I moved in with Ray, and that has been the same situation since. I have recently been freelance writing for a couple news publications oversees/working on selling some screenplays to some studios, and it has been such a strain on me lately, but Ray had been being so good to me lately, a total sweetheart. Ray is constantly on tour/working with friends/partners in California (we live in the northeast). I'm used to him not being home or not having a necessarily consistent schedule. I don't really either (I'm sometimes in California myself with some production work I do with my old cinematographer partner.) The arrangement was always nice, and it felt really good to be with someone who understood how hard it is to manage a life on a creative schedule. Honestly, I figured once Ray got back from his business trip, he was going to propose to me. I know that's stupid to just assume that, but after how well things had been going with us, I was really just getting this overwhelming feeling of love and hope that I was just so excited about. 

HOWEVER. 

The other day (week ago at this point), I was browsing Ray's instagram looking for a specific picture, and I noticed the ""tagged pictures"" tab on the top of the page. I'm kind of illiterate at social media stuff.  At this point, Ray was in California overseeing some stuff with his new merch or whatever. I felt myself missing him a lot, so I thought seeing some funny, candid pictures of him would cheer me up/remind me of how cute he is. So, I click on the tab and scroll down a little bit. I see a picture of this cute blonde woman, Catie kissing his cheek. I didn't think anything of it at first. He's a relatively popular musician, not like getting on any charts anywhere, but a lot of people in a specific scene at least know ""of"" him. So, thought it was just another fan. But, when I scroll down more...I see more and more pictures of this woman and him. I click on the picture for who she's tagged as, I click her profile...I'm blocked? Immediately, I got a bad gut feeling. I ended up logging out of my account and into my company's (I know, scummy but now it seems worth it). I click on her profile, and I almost throw up. Basically besides a couple pictures of food, scenery, or shopping haul shots, it's just all pics of either her and Ray or just Ray. I do some more digging and I see that HER AND RAY ARE FUCKING ENGAGED. People are congratulating them! There's a pic of her holding up a hand with a ring up and you can see Ray in the background smiling. I want to fucking die right now. 

It's been 3 days since Ray has gotten back from the trip, and I don't even know what to say. He knows that I'm upset about something, I think. He wanted to have sex when he finally got home (we always have a really fun romp once he comes back) but the thought of it made me fucking sick. I don't know how to talk to him about this. I know I'm just postponing something by doing this, but I honestly have no fucking clue how to approach my future. I honestly still love him so much and the thought of being without him right now makes my head want to explode. I don't even care that he was with someone else if he would just stop doing it and apologize. I understand that humans are not inherently monogamous, and hell, I've thought about other people and even kissed someone one time during a LSD trip a couple years ago. I never told him about that either. But this seems really unacceptable and I feel really disrespected. HOw could he just have this entire secret life and just like hide it...for so many years. As far back in her timeline I scrolled (5 years), they had clearly been dating. I wonder if they've been together the entire time me and Ray were together. 
  

I know this is so long and rambly but I just need help deciding where I go from here. We live together, and I don't really have housing in the area right now that would be easy for me to just *go*, you know? Should I just pretend I don't know anything until I can find another place and then just unload then? Should I try to talk to him now and see what's going on?

"UPDATE: My grandmother [70 F] threw my [13 M] homework in the trash


[ORGININAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51zki0/my_grandmother_70f_threw_my_13m_homework_in_the)

*Sorry for the late update guys, I have been a bit busy with school and other things. First, I want to thank everyone who has helped me! I have seen a lot of great suggestions and I'm really grateful.*

**WHAT HAPPENED**

As a lot of you have said, I have asked my parents for a lock on my door. They said that they understand what happened and why I want a lock, so they agreed with this suggestion. *Special thank you's to /u/Nekomama12 ; /u/SugarKyle ; /u/ParappaTheRaptor* 

* **Crazy grandma stops entering my room.**

I have told my mom to write a note to my history teacher, she did write it and sign it. I have also told my teacher about my story and he has given me more time to do the assignment. (it's done now)

* **Teacher gave me more time for the assignment**

I have also searched for different apps to save my work, and now I also write it on a computer first so this stuff doesn't happen again.

**SIDE NOTE**: Some people have noticed that my grammar is okay for a 13 year old whose second language is English, thank you! I work pretty hard for this and the internet has helped me a lot, because most sites are in English, so I had to learn it.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr** Parents got me a lock, teacher extended the time for my assignment, I do my work on a computer first, redditors have complimented my grammar. Thanks!

---

**EDIT**: This seems like a pretty short update, sorry if it's not what you expected.

**EDIT2**: To clear things up about my educational system. I live in a small-ish town from *insert random country from Europe*. The schools here are pretty bad, especially in the rural areas where I live. The classrooms are old, most teachers came here during revolution, so they're still oldschool. Most of the times we have to give handwritten assignments, as if, if we write them on a computer and then print them, the teacher tells us to do it again. Also, the desks and chairs are pretty bad too. All of them are at the same height and I don't fit in them.. My knees lift the desk if I rest normally on the old, wooden chair.. This school in particular is just really bad.. Most teachers are cool but the conditions are just.. bad. *Also, fights happen regularly here, either MvsM, FvsF, or MvsF.*

**EDIT3**: Well, this blew up didn't it? Thanks for the amazing support! Never imagined that ~~750~~ ***1000***+ strangers would be interested in what happened to me!"

"Me [41 M] with my ex-wife [40 F] My ex is now in an abusive relationship. I have taken full custody of our children. I thought it was the right decision but now I am not so sure.


This situation is very fucked to put it likely. My ex and I grew up together, married young, and divorced about 5 years ago. We have two children, both under the age of 13. The divorce was mutual and we managed to maintain a very good relationship/friendship afterwards. We split custody 50/50 and would spend at least one weekend together with our children a month. 

About two years ago my ex met Asshole. Asshole is a terrible person and all around piece of shit. Unfortunately my ex was unable to see this for some reason and fell very hard for him. After about 6 months they moved in together. After they began living together, things started to decline very very rapidly. He began to prevent my ex from spending time with her friends/family. He encouraged her to quit her job and be a stay at home wife, and despite the fact that she was in a career she loved, she agreed. She stated spending 100% of her time with him (he works from home) and basically cut off everyone in her life. People expressed worry and as soon as they did, they were cut off b/c ""if they can't be happy that she is happy, they don't deserve her time"". 

Immediately after moving in together our monthly ""family weekends"" ended b/c he thought of them as disrespectful to their relationship. This despite the fact that he was welcome to join, just as my girlfriend has for the last 3 years. She stopped interacting with me at all ""out of respect for him"" and it got to the point where I could not talk to her unless it was through him. This all went on through the first year and a half. 

About 7 months ago or so he has started extending his behavior to my children. He attempted to force them to cut off people in their lives, even trying to home school them. He started bad talking me/my girlfriend to them and encouraging them to dislike us. My ex started doing the same. 

Then I found out he was beating her. I had my suspicions but before this point I had no proof. Then she was sent to the hospital with very severe injuries after ""falling down the stairs"". The stairs don't give you strangle marks on your neck. I had been asking my kids about this for months, but they never mentioned anything about violence and had always insisted that they liked their time at their mothers house. 

Come to find out it is because Asshole and my ex had basically convinced them that if they ""tattled"" about the abuse their mother would wind up in prison and they would never see her again. After this came out (while my ex was still in the hospital) i immediately took my children and got an emergency order for full custody. This was about 3 months ago. My children have not been allowed back at their mothers place since. I refuse to allow them to interact with Asshole at all. 

Their mother is welcome to visit them in a neutral space, but asshole is not allowing it and she is going along with it. My kids miss their mother and they are starting to resent me for keeping them away from her. I have done everything i can think of to give her a chance to remain in their lives. I have offered to allow sleep-overs at their grandparents (her side) with their mother. 

I have offered to allow her to stay at my home with the kids for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I would sleep elsewhere so she would have the place to herself with them. But she is not budging. She refuses to accept any visitation where her boyfriend is not present. Out of desperation I have even offered to allow visits at her place with her boyfriend present as long as I am able to chaperone for the entire time. 

Even this was rejected since ""it is disrespectful to her boyfriend"". I am at my wits end here. My ex has always been a confident, strong minded woman. She has been extremely successful (partner at her law firm by the age of 35) and has never been one to take shit from people. I don't understand how she can allow this man to break her like this. 

I don't understand how she is putting him, before her own kids. And now my kids are starting to blame me for keeping her away from them. Today, my youngest asked me why i hate her mom and don't want her mom to love them. I honestly don't know what to do. Please, just tell me, was i wrong to take full custody? Should I let her see them on her terms? He has never hit my kids or even been mean to them (as far as I know). 

He is actually overly nice to them, never yells at them or anything. But he actually will yell at my ex for discipling them. While i don't think they are at risk with him, i don't want them seeing that type of behavior and thinking it is ok. Reddit, just give some words please.

Soo i tried making this post a little while back but it was taken down because it was an update... idk.. either way, a lot of you asked for an update so here it is, hopefully this one isnt taken down

Wow, sooo that last post pretty much blew up more than i thought haha, I want to thank everyone who commented on it. I may not have been able to respond to everyone but i did read them and fairly enjoyed some of them as well as appreciated the advice.

Heres the link to the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51igu1/me_21m_with_my_ex_gf_19_f_she_has_super/

So i wanted to wait until after the weekend to post the update because a lot happened and oh man its a pretty good update that most of you will enjoy.

So her dad called my dad and was very ""emotional"" and pretty pissed off that i lied to him in the sense that i not only told him i hadnt slept with her but didnt plan on it... (What else are you supposed to say? Yes i plan on going hard on the paint? WTF?) My dad was pretty taken back and didnt really know what to say. Her dad continued on saying how he wanted to let my parents know what a man whore i was and how i took his daughters virginity and that it needed to be fixed.

My dad just told him he was sorry, he was disappointed in me and he would handle it. He talked to him some more and calmed him down and then hung up and blocked his number.
My dad called me and told me what had happened, (i did not give them a heads up) he was pretty calm about it, for a bit he thought the guy wanted money or something but when he realized he basically just wanted to tattle he just left it at that.

My mom on the other hand called me shortly after and flipped out on me about how i could have gotten her pregnant, and did i even think about what would have happened if she got pregnant, or if i got an STD and a whole bunch of other things. Basically a fun time.

I went home this past weekend to pick up something from my parents house i needed for my apartment. (something that was mine, just couldnt take it with me the first time because it didnt fit in the car) So it was a pretty awkward weekend. I did see my sister and she made soooo many jokes about how one would go fixing a situation like this as how my ex wanted to. Because you know, virginitys are basically sold and given and what not. But yeah thats the update. All is well for now, many awkwards were had relationship with parents is much strained. :)


TLDR: Dude called my parents, tattled on me, went home, got awkward sex talk, never stick your dick in girl with crazy family.

"My father [40sM] ""left"" before I [19F] was born and never came back. I recently found his extended family online and discovered that he has been dead for 20 years. [Non-Romantic]


repost cuz first one was removed {didnt write it properly}
  
Sorry for the long post...try to bear with me


First off my father was Indian and my mother was white and they both met at coffee shop outside of each others buildings. He went by ""bobby"" and stayed with my mother for some before going to another country for a job and broke it off with my mom. My mom became pregnant with me so she tried to contact him but he never responded to her messages.


As a result my mom had to raise me alone... At least until she her current husband who I consider my own father. My mom told me the whole truth when i turned 16 but i really had no desire to look Bobby up.


I recently decided to look up Bobby after meeting my boyfriends family (also Indian) because honestly i felt jealous seeing how big and friendly his family was. (My mom raised me in her hometown so i never really got to understand my ""dads"" culture despite getting all the shit from other kids about it.)


My parents, while being honest with me, weren't exactly in support of building a relationship with Bobby as my mom still has some resentment towards him (as do i ofc) so i haven't told her i was searching for him - she is a great mom but a tad too emotional.
So some time after, I got some help from my friends and was able to find Bobby's family but found out that bobby has been dead for years (a car accident). I am pretty sure he was my biological father since his name and the info posted about him seem to match what my mom had told me.


But right now I am extremely confused about what to do. Bobby apparently had a huge extended family (a couple of siblings with a couple of kids each plus a pair of grandparents!) and I cant help but feel sorry for blaming him for not being there when he was clearly dead.


Do I contact his family and if yes, what do I say? I mean i have seen Indian families who are extremely welcoming but i was not raised in their culture and only started learning about it since dating my boyfriend. On the other hand Indian families can be very conservative (especially towards girls with boyfriends i dunno) (and i don't want to be known as the bastard white child of their son)...is it possible that they knew about my existence to begin with? Is it even worth building ties with them? How would I begin to even ask for DNA test or something like that...


What do i tell my mom and father? Would being direct be the best option? How do I get them to change their minds so they help seal this issue for me?


**TL;DR Bio father left before i was born, raised by my mom (I am half Indian but never experienced the Indian part) and recently found his extended family but also that my bio dad has been dead for my entire life. How do I go about dealing with this? Advice appreciated especially from first gen. Indians.**"

"The mother [35 F] of my daughter [16 F] is trying to reconnect with me [32 M] after being gone for 16 years


I met Vanessa when I was 15. It was just a random night out really. I didn't know her and she didn't know me. We both got drunk, made out with each other and stuck together for the rest of the night. It's silly when I look back on it now, but I was in love for the first time and I really thought this meant something. We exchanged numbers and for the next few months we went out on dates and slept together on a number of occasions.


Vanessa comes from an well-off family background. Not crazy kind of rich, but still significantly wealthy. I had no idea about any of this until the day when she called me and said she wanted to talk with me. Part of that talk was her disclosing this information, which overwhelmed me at the age of 15 because my own family was borderline middle-class at best and even my sisters and I worked part-time jobs whenever we could to help out.
 

The other part was that she was two weeks shy of being two months pregnant. How? Well, I mean, the usual way yeah, but we used protection, both on my end (condoms) and on hers (birth control pills). I was fucking terrified. Fifteen years old and my older girlfriend was pregnant and oh my God, her parents were going to kill me (if they got to me before mine did). This is basically what was running through my head. 


She said she wanted to keep the baby and in a way I was happy about it, despite the impact it would have on our lives. I mean, this surely meant we'd be together for years and years to come, right? Wrong. She didn't actually tell her parents about the pregnancy and instead kept it a secret (it helped that she already had a place of her own and didn't see them all that often) until it couldn't be kept a secret. They weren't happy about it. They were even more unhappy when they found who exactly was the father. It's not just that I was younger than her that they had a problem with (mind you, 14 is the age of consent here), it was also the fact that I basically came from a lower class background than them. Like I said, we weren't really poor, and we never lacked for food on our table, but luxuries also weren't really a thing for us unless my sisters or me earned extra money on side jobs for them.

By the time they found out, terminating the pregnancy wasn't an option, but our relationship did come to an end. Since she completely depended on her family's support, she had to choose: me or them. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was young and naive and in love. She chose them. That, I could understand, once I was a bit older. But it wasn't her parents who told her she had to give up the child. Vanessa did that all on her own. 


Basically, very soon after she gave birth, I was invited to come to their home and was then asked if I wanted custody over our daughter. If not, she would give her up for adoption. Her parents didn't even care, they wanted nothing to do with their granddaughter. I honestly can't understand how someone can be this cold and detached. It wasn't really a choice for me. I didn't care that I was just barely 16 at the time or that my family didn't really have all that much money to spare. This was my child. No way in hell would I give her up for adoption. Vanessa signed over all rights to me, arranged for child support to be provided over the years with her parents and that was that. 


I won't bore you with all the details of my life as a young single parent who still had school to finish. That's not important. Suffice to say, my family (close and extended) helped me out a great deal with it and I don't think I could have made it without them. A lot of them are still close to us to this day and their children are good friends with my daughter. Despite it all, we managed to have a decent, good life. 


Natalie (my daughter) is a child a parent could only hope for. She's kind and compassionate, the kind of person that everyone wants to be friends with, and she takes her education very seriously. Very, very rarely did I have to ground her or discipline her in some other way. What I think I love most of all about my daughter is that she talks to me. I know this sounds silly, but she comes to me and genuinely talks about any issues she might be having at the time. She opens herself up to me (to a certain degree) and I can't begin to describe how happy I am that my daughter trusts me so much. 


Three months ago, Vanessa contacted my family. Not my daughter or myself, but my parents and my sisters. My sisters - well, they're very protective of me and of their niece, so they had a few none too polite words to share with her once Vanessa told them she wanted to get in touch with me. She actually had some contact information already, but Natalie and me weren't in the country (summer vacation) so this was her only option at the time.


My family gave us some room to breathe once we got back before they told us about Vanessa contacting them.


Now, Natalie knows about my history with her mother because she asked me about it and I told her the truth. I mean, she obviously knew her mother wasn't there with us from a young age, but only two years ago did she ask me about the details behind everything. She surprised me how maturely she handled it by shrugging it off, saying ""Her loss,"" and moving on. When Vanessa did get in touch with me, she asked about Natalie and I told her that if she wanted to talk with her, she should ask her and not me, given that Natalie is of age where she can decide this on her own. 


Again, I have to say how much I love my daughter and how considerate she can be. Before meeting with her mother, she actually came to me to talk about it and if I was okay with it. To be honest, I have no opinion on the matter. If Natalie wants a relationship with her mother, she can build one, I have no reason to stand in the way of my daughter's happiness. Anyway, Natalie did end up meeting her mother, but in the past month, she started cutting down on the time she spent with her. When it looked like her mother was bothering her, I asked Natalie what was going on.


She told me she wasn't really feeling any sort of connection to her mother and that she agreed to meet her in the first place simply out of curiosity and nothing more. Natalie doesn't feel any kind of longing or need to have Vanessa in her life and told me that she can't really even think about her as a mother or a mother figure. That honor belonged to her aunts (my sisters) and she told them as much last Sunday, after a family lunch. Needless to say, my sisters were gushing and very emotional afterwards. Everyone was. It was a lovely day, all in all.


Sorry I dragged on about this so much, I just wanted you to know the basic background on things before I get to the issue in the title. 


But anyway, Vanessa. I think she's started to realize that she can't just have a close relationship with Natalie, not for now at least, and so she's laid off from asking her to come visit her so often. Who knows? Maybe Natalie will have form some kind of bond with her. Maybe she won't.


After this, it seems like she shifted her focus from Natalie to me. Granted, we did talk briefly when she first got in touch, nothing too much, just the basic kind of conversation, but I've no interest in what her life has been (or is) like, so long as it's not a disruption to my daughter's. Her parents are still alive, but they haven't bothered to get in touch with their granddaughter or me.  She's not married, never has been, though she was engaged to someone several years ago. 


Recently it feels like she's trying to gauge whether I consider her attractive. We meet occasionally, since she wants to learn about Natalie's childhood, see pictures of it and so on. Fine, I bring the stuff with me, but she always seems to want to sit too close or touch me casually or complain about some piece of clothing she's wearing, while drawing attention to her various body parts (cleavage, exposed legs, her neck). It feels like she's fishing for compliments, for me to say that she shouldn't worry, that she's attractive or that it looks good on her, but I'm simply not engaging.


It's getting to the point where even Natalie knows what's going on, as her mother asked her if I was involved with someone before. My dating life, in truth, is pretty much nonexistent. When I was younger, I had my daughter to take care of as best as I could. That meant she came before everything and everyone in my life. Did I still have sex? Well, yeah, here and there, but it was rare and ultimately couldn't lead to anywhere because there's not a whole lot of girls out there who'd actually date and seriously commit to a single father in their 20s. 


I suppose I could date if I wanted to now, but honestly? I don't feel a great need to do so. Life is good. 


Even if I did want to date though, I wouldn't get involved with Vanessa again.


However, I realize I can't be too harsh with her on this if my daughter decides in the future to pursue a stronger relationship with her, so I remain civil, if somewhat distant, with her. There isn't some kind of upcoming date where I expect this to be settled once and for all. I'm not in any rush nor do I expect to find a miraculous solution which makes Vanessa completely back off on that front, but I would like to know if there's something more I could do to negate or deny her interest in (dating) me, aside from just ignoring her attempts at getting closer to me.

She broke up with me because of her parents, before giving birth, gave up our daughter to me, legally, and hasn't been present in either of our lives for over 16 years. Now she's back and has attempted to bond with my daughter. It's not happening due to Natalie not seeing her as any kind of maternal figure and their relationship is just barely there. She's started expressing an interest in me and possibly us two having a relationship beyond what we currently have. What could I do to make it clear to her, without completely imploding my daughter's relationship with her in the process, that I am simply not interested and never will be in dating or being with her?**  "

"My fiancee [28F] has left me [29M] two weeks before our wedding.


I (29m) am absolutely heartbroken the way my fiancée (28f) has left me. For starters We had such a great relationship, we always put each other first and lived very happily in our little apartment. Just a very easy, loving relationship where we were both at one point so excited to be married and have kids. We met in college but didn't start dating until shortly after we graduated. After about three years I had saved up enough to buy her the ring she wanted and asked her to marry me in the Boston Commons. It was the best day of my life. We had booked our wedding about 6 months ago in Maine at a beautiful seaside location. It was supposed to be a small wedding, about 25 people, and then we were headed to Japan for our honeymoon a couple days after. A couple days ago we drove to Maine (were from Massachusetts) to get our marriage license and choose a spot for our rehearsal dinner. she seemed oddly quiet as my parents fawned over us, taking pictures of us signing the license and trying out different restaurants for the rehearsal dinner. The next day she came home from work very stoic and cold. We usually kiss and talk about our days the second we get home but instead she weirdly walked over to the couch and turned off the TV. She was breathing heavily and informed me that ""we need to talk"". My mind started racing about what I could have possibly done wrong. We have such a loving, open honest relationship that I thought it could be something trivial or maybe something horrible happened to her at work. ""I can't marry you because I don't love you anymore"".


To say I was stunned would be an understatement. She had to tell me about 5x because I simply couldn't believe what she said. Did I not hear her correctly? Is she kidding? Is this just a nightmare? WTF is going on?!?


I think I cycled through the first four stages of grief in about 2 minutes. Denial, anger, bargaining and depression, all in one horrific, blinding smear of emotions.


She apologized profusely and told me that she had fallen out of love with me a couple months ago. I couldn't belive it. I still can't. I'm horribly depressed thinking how the woman I loved so much and had so looked forward to starting a family with could shatter my whole world in such a fast, totally unexpected moment.

She left an hour later with a bag of clothes, bound for her sisters house. A couple miles away. She been there for two days now. 

Our families are both devastated by the news. Her sister is talking everything over with her to figure out what went wrong.


I know she never wanted a wedding. She has extreme social (""performance"") anxiety and she would always look to me for support and love whenever she felt that way. Her best friend and grandparents also said they would not be able to attend which I'm sure hurt her. I feel bad for not just eloping.


Her parents and grandparents are also divorced, she hates talking about their breakup which makes me wonder if she is terrified it could happen to her.


Or maybe she just doesn't love me anymore. Which is such a brutal thought for me thinking all the memories and love we've created the past few years.


I'm sick with grief and feel like I'll never recover. I'm also contemplating going to Japan by myself since I already booked everything. Just the thought of that is actually kind of funny in a dark, dark way. Like traveling around doing all these romantic things by myself. Though I am holding out hope she will join me. 


Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get over it? 


Thanks fellow Reddittors.


Tl;dr my fiancée, completely unexpected, informed me she has fallen out of love with me and can't marry me 2 weeks before our wedding/honeymoon. I'm very depressed.

"I [20F] got hired at the coffee shop my best friend [20F] works at and now shes telling me she doesnt want to work together.


Got hired at the same coffee shop as my friend, Sam. Prior to hiring, she helped me with application and everything. I am also friends with the manager, Carry, and many employees because this is where I go to study. It was not difficult to get the job, as the manager-friend offered me several times the 6 months I've known her.

Anyways, yesterday I went there to study. Sam took her thirty and sat with me. she told me she only encouraged and helped me with my application because she really, really thought I wouldnt get hired (considered conflict of interest). She then told me ""its like working with a boyfriend. i dont want to see you that much"" (we dont even hang out anymore, havent in a month or two). She said it was annoying that i was friends with employees. She asked our manager friend to only have me work nights (she works mornings). anything involving this job she gets annoyed and kind of upset. but still acts normal despite this, like nothing happened. 

Kind of hurt. why didnt she tell me this before applying? am i overreacting? What should i do? how should i act at work? is it my fault? where do i go from there? should i quit? its not my main income, i got this job for fun and to take up my extensive free time.

  **tl;dr**: got job at same coffee shop as best friend. she says i will annoy her and never wanted me to work with her, despite helping me get the job. says it was annoying that i became friends with her coworkers. what do?

Edit: Okay wow I didn't expect this much feedback. Its only been five hours but I've decided that I'm going to keep my job, work my 16 hours, be friends with who i want to be, and be myself. Thank you so much for the replies. I think my friend is jealous. That makes me so sad. I've never been jealous of her (maybe a lil competitive because she inspires me when she pushes herself), i'm always really really excited for her future and all her accomplishments. Neither of us are perfect friends but its clear that the more replies i give and comments i receive, i'm forced to reflect more deeply about our friendship.  I'm not going to go out of my way to ignore her but i am going to just give up on salvaging our friendship outside of work. It is clear that while she is nice to me outside of her (or our) job but mean to me during those work hours, this does not translate to having a good, healthy, and compatible friendship. I'm pretty sad and hurt but I think in the long run, its best for not only me but her to end our friendship.

Thank you everyone -- downvoted and upvoted opinions, i appreciate them all.

ANOTHER EDIT: Forgot to mention, will probably update in a couple weeks or month. My hopes are mainly no tension will be made between me or anyone, I will be civil and truly make efforts to enjoy myself. Even if my decision is ultimate and a bummer for our (or what seems to be only mine haha) social lives, its still a job and its not about me or her. everyones just collecting checks. I hope to achieve these goals in a month or so! Again thank you! By the way, she's not a horrible person...she just can work on her bestfriendship skills. We're just not fit to be best friends. please dont call her anything really mean. that sucks to read too."

"My [15M] brother [21M] scared his daughter [4F] who lives with us with the a super scary mask. She keeps running to my room in the middle of the night when she's scared


Hi Reddit, I'm sorry if this is minor and don't know if this is the right place. It's 6:50 am In Australia right now and I have not been able to sleep since 4 am. 

My niece is in the custody of my mother because my brother and his wife should have never be allowed to breed. They thought it was a good idea to have meth while their daughter was around. Various other problems and my niece lives with my mom, sisters and I. We are all in high school or secondary college as it's formally called here. 

My mom is a nurse and she usually works nights. My brother back when he used to visit his daughter, he has ran away to Perth with his wife. Have not heard from them in months. I am the only man in the house and this is the issue I currently face. My brother scared his daughter by hiding in her room with the most terrifying mask I have ever seen.  It was an old man that looked like he was scalping himself, ripping off the top layer of skin on his face. He got it off some hollywood effect mask sight so it was super realistic. 

It's just me she does this too, She comes into my room, climbs under my blankets and shakes me saying ""Uncle Roman"" again and again. At least 3 times every night. Shes scared the monster is in her room every night despite me checking numerous times. 

I sometimes can't get back to sleep and I don't know what to do

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54xuqe/my_parents_54_52_expecting_me_25m_and_sister_25f/

Thank you for all of your advice. Not a *final* update (that won't be for a few years), but my sister and I spoke (and read over the advice), and decided on setting more strict boundaries and coming up with guidelines on how we would help.

We let our parents know that they needed to sell the properties and do everything in their power to get under the debt. We decided to offer up to $30k each (as a gift) if they could show us that they were almost there and had already made every last attempt to take care of it themselves, and that money would be the last step. We also let them know that if they lost everything, we would cover a mortgage payment for a house of up to $230k (a very reasonable place for where they are), but it would be in our names. Our dad was not happy at all and started getting upset again, but I was much more firm with him this time. He did say some of the same stuff again (at the start of the conversation, before we told him our plan: ""your mom and I talked, and you guys can have the rest if there's leftover,"" and after we told him, he started raising his voice and talking down to us. He also said something like ""you should talk to some of your friends, I think you'll see just how selfish you're being."" I didn't tell him about the post, but it definitely made me feel more validated and recognize the statement simply as an attempt at guilt tripping.) I wanted to tell him to shut up when he said that stuff, and I know a lot of people would recommend being more firm on that front too, but he's not going to change -- I'm not going to convince him to stop putting his foot in his mouth, and it's not worth the stress of arguing for me. I just need to remember that it's more evidence that he's handling the situation like a child, and needs to be treated as such. I also don't want to not assist them at all, especially since my mom has been much more measured in how she interacts with us, and I'm helping her out more than him.

I spoke with my mom later and she had more of an air of being sad, but I think she's starting to accept reality, which is what they've gotta do. I explained it to her that I saw two obligations here: relationship and financial. From a strictly financial standpoint, I was making the right decision. You would never buy houses in all cash if you were maximizing ROI, so paying off the debt (even with transaction costs) to keep the houses didn't make sense, and I have also shown myself to be the best manager of finances in the family. From a relationship standpoint, I told her that there was no gap between what she wanted and what I was giving her, and that's why a guilt trip wasn't going to work. They'd have a free house, and plenty of money from my father's pension and anything they got to keep to eat and travel.

My relationship with my dad will never recover completely, I'm sure, but that's life. Sometimes you're forced into personal or family relationships with people who have very serious character flaws. Rather than viewing this as an event that damaged our relationship, I simply view it as something that has highlighted to me one of those flows and forced me to adjust how I interact accordingly.

"Considering banning my (24F) roommate (22F) from using the guest room. Too harsh, or justified?


When I moved for a new job, I found a really nice three bedroom house for rent. It was a little too expensive for me, and I don't like living alone anyway, so I decided to sublet one of the rooms for 1/3 of the total rent. I kept the other two rooms for myself as a bedroom and an office/guest room. 

My last roommate had people stay in the guest room from time to time, which I was fine with because she always asked permission, cleaned up after them, and never caused me any problems. 

When my roommate of two months, Amy, asked if her parents could stay in the room last weekend, I was okay with it. What I didn't realize at first was that they planned to arrive Thursday night, and that Amy would take off work Friday to spend time with them. I stupidly agreed, but told her that I was working from home on Friday, and that her parents needed to be out of the room by 8. I didn't care if they stayed in the house, but I needed the office back. 

When Friday morning came, I found them still lounging around in their pajamas when I went to go to work. They gave me crap about being on vacation and not wanting to get up early. I told them I would take my laptop to the living room and give them half an hour. If they still wanted to sleep they would have to go to Amy's room. 

I come back later, and they are still in there. I politely ask them to leave, and they tell me it's not fair for me to control the whole house just because Amy is a subletter. I told them that had nothing to do with it, that I paid for this room and was letting them use it to be nice. They grumbled but finally left, and the whole time Amy was sitting right there and just let it all happen. They later tried to come back it without knocking while I was in a meeting, and were very upset to find that I had locked them out. I heard them talking about me later that night, like I'm the asshole in the situation, and Amy didn't correct them or do anything. After they left on Sunday, I told her I was mad at how her parents acted and she gave me a really half hearted apology and said sorry for her parents ""running late"" that day, like it was some crazy accident that couldn't be prevented. 

I'm considering not letting her use the guest room if she is going to let them trample all over my time and inconvenience me. But part of me wonders if it's too harsh for a one time incident. Her parents seem like jerks, but that doesn't mean everyone who would come to visit Amy is, so I don't know if I'm being petty.

Tldr: roommates parents overstayed their welcome in my office/guest room, and I'm considering not letting my roommate use it again."
"I [29F] caught my fiancé [29M] in the act of cheating on me at our place. My life is in shambles..


This has been the worst weekend of my life. I have had to put up with a lot of shit in my life, but this absolutely takes the cake. This is my first post on /r/relationships; my best friend recommended me to come here and get some outside perspective. Any suggestions on what I should be doing moving forward would be great. I'm really upset right now so I apologize if my story is spotty. 

I want to keep everything anonymous, so I will call my boyfriend ""Justin"". Justin and I have been together for over 4 years now, and over a year of being engaged. Justin and I both met post college through a mutual friends party, and the rest is history. Justin and I have always had a stable relationship. Both of us have decent jobs, although I am working hard to get a promotion at this PR firm I have been working at since I was 26 (post school). Justin and I met after college/university, so both of us had very separate lives and lifestyles. We didn't actually move in together until after dating for 2 years. The time seemed right, we looked for a place together, and took are time with moving forward. Last summer (June of 2015), Justin proposed to me at a very well known beach on the west coast of SoCal. I didn't except a proposal as simple, yet so beautiful - during sunset to be exact. It was amazing! 

The one thing I can look at now, is that our relationship seemed to be very redundant over the course of the last couple years; especially after we got engaged. Both of us weren't really in a rush to set up our wedding, and regular life seemed to always be the boiling point for us. That being said, our summer project was to set up our wedding for next May. Over the course of the summer, I was taking a lot of my spare time to put in a lot of work for setting everything up. Justin wasn't as involved as he said he was going to be, but it didn't really bother me too much. Our wedding was planned to be a very small one. Mainly just our immediate families, close friends, colleges, and cousins - that's it. We wanted to have more of a ""quality"" or ""quantity"" type wedding. This way, we could actually put time, effort, and money, into people we care about. 

Anyway, I should get to the point here. Sorry, I guess I felt everything I mentioned above can be relevant for your observations of my post. This past weekend, I have been spending a little bit of time with my mother. She has been redecorating and updating her office space, so I spent most of the weekend going back and forth to help her out. It was great bonding time all in all for the both of us. Yesterday, I went back to my place mid afternoon to grab some things to bring back over to my parents place, and something seemed fishy..

I arrived back to my place to see that another car was sitting out front (I believe it was a silver Mazda or something?). I went inside, but it didn't seem like anyone was even home. That being said, Justin's car was in the garage when I pulled in. I walked downstairs to go to our storage area to get what I needed, and then I heard Justin and this female voice talking. I quickly ran over to the area I heard their voices (guest room), and it looked like they were putting on their clothes, chit chatting away. I asked Justin what was going on here. He mentioned to me that this female was ""Cara"", and she was over discussing details about their job - ""coworker"". I politely asked Justin to come over and talk to me. During my talk with Justin, I heard Cara leave through our basement door.

I asked Justin what the fuck was going on. He got defensive and told me that they were discussing a work project. I asked him why they were in the guest room, and Justin replied with; ""I was giving her a tour of her place"". Bullshit; I yelled out to him. I gave him an ultimatum and tell me what was going on, or else I would be staying at my parents place for the time being. Justin finally broke down, chasing me throughout our place, and told me that he had been having casual sex with his coworker Cara for a better part of the month. He then went on to tell me that they had sex 3 times, talked a lot at work about our relationship, and asked her for advice on our relationship. That moment sticks out to me still. 

I ran out of the house and went over to my parents place. My mother knew I was upset about something and I talked to her about it the rest of the night. I am still at my parents place, staying here for god knows how long, trying to figure out what to do. I feel like a chump. Justin has tried sending me messages, calling me, and getting other people (his friends) to reason with me. I don't know what to do. I have invested so much into this relationship, specifically with our wedding next May. We also have a place together.. Money, time, my time, and so much effort. 

I don't know what to do moving forward.. So much of my life has been invested into this relationship, and now it is compellable all for not. Help?

"When my wife [37F] turns me down for sex, it's fine, but when I [38M] turn her down, it's ""abusive"". Married 12 years


Pretty much what the title says. My wife and I don't have sex very often anymore, perhaps 3-4 times a month. I work a very demanding job, she's a stay-at-home mom for our 3 kids. I try to initiate several times a week and get turned down 9 times out of 10. Although it does upset me to be rejected so often, I just say ""whatever"" and either go to sleep or jerk off (I keep this secret from her because she would flip out and it's not a fight worth having). For the very few times she agrees to have sex, it's always great and she enjoys it very much, as do I.


She sometimes initiates but always seems to do so when I'm either completely drained of energy from work/chores or so totally not in the mood. I've told her many times to not initiate when I'm tired, and that I would gladly welcome her advances on weekends. However she never initiates on the weekends (and turns me down when I do), and only ever makes a move when I'm too tired to move myself or in no mood for sex. When I turn her down, she gets very upset and says things like ""this isn't a marriage"" or ""it's abusive to withhold intimacy"". 


Shit like this enrages me because of the disgusting hypocrisy she's showing, and the fact that my wife is selfish when it comes to sex; sex only happens when she wants it. I've tried explaining this hypocrisy to her but she seemingly doesn't understand it, claiming that when she turns down sex, it's because she's too tired/sick/not in the mood (which she considers legitimate excuses), but when I turn down sex, I'm intentionally dismissing her sexual needs.


I'm at my wit's end with this bullshit. She can keep turning me down for the rest of my life and I won't mind, but every time she cries abuse when I turn her down, I feel like punching a hole in the wall. I'm seriously starting to resent my wife and frankly my mind shifts to thoughts of divorce on occasion.

Me and my boyfriend are 'highschool sweethearts', and have been together since we were 15. After a relationship of almost 10 years, I am feeling out of love.

We had our ups and downs, but this is more than that. I simply do not love him anymore, and it makes me feel like a horrible person. But I have already been feeling like this for almost half a year, and staying together only makes me feel worse. 

But here's the catch: I am paying for almost everything, as he is still studying and I have a full-time job. He does have a small job and gets some money from the government, but combined with the heartbreak and we live in a big, fairly expensive city.... I don't know if he can handle it.

I talked to my sister about it, and she told me to be selfish: it's my life, I should not feel unhappy for his sake. But I don't know how. How can I leave someone who has no place to go without me?

Thank you guys for your support! I still feel like crap (obviously), but I'm starting to realize that I am not a horrible person for falling out of love. 

I will make a 'gameplan' on how we can proceed after the break-up. Some of you suggested moving into separate bedrooms: unfortunately, we live in a very small flat and that is not an option. But we will figure something out, as soon as I get to talk to him (he's currently avoiding it, he can probably feel it coming). 

He's a great guy and you guys are right when you say he's an adult and will figure something out. We both deserve to move on.

***

Figured I'd write this for the people who asked for an update. Since writing my last post, I've been to one more dinner at my parents' house. I brought a family friend with me and asked her to keep an eye out for any funny behavior coming from Nick. I also hoped her presence would thwart any of his advances. I think a combination of my friend's presence and him being the one cooking that night made it so that he didn't talk to me much, which was great.

Of course, there was still a weird moment and it happened when I was grabbing wine from my parents' fridge in the garage. I had no idea Nick followed me so I yelped when he said something. My sister called from the kitchen to ask what happened and I said Nick scared me because he came out of nowhere. He said, ""There's a joke to be made about that."" I gave him a weird look and he said, ""Me coming out of nowhere."" Clearly a sexual thing. I ignored it and booked it out of the garage before he could do anything else, and for the rest of the night, that was it. My friend and I left early and I said goodbye to everyone from the door, pretending to be in a rush. 

Two days after that dinner, I woke up to way more Instagram notifications than I'm used to. I checked it and it was one brand new account tagging me in a bunch of sex joke memes or sexual pictures, a lot of them being women wearing wet T-shirts. There was also one of a woman in a S&amp;M-looking Catwoman outfit and I was tagged along with the words ""you in this."" Immediately suspected Nick. Didn't know how to approach it and it didn't tag me in anything beyond that burst of ten photos, so I didn't do anything about it. I told some friends, but wasn't sure what else I could really do.

Later that week, I got a Facebook friend request from someone I didn't know. I recently created a new ""for people I actually know"" Facebook profile (close friends and family I actually talk to and have seen recently). I don't get friend requests often anymore as I'm totally private and unsearchable, so this request was the only one that day and made me instantly suspicious. I thought it was some fake profile Nick made, but weirdly enough I looked into this guy's profile and saw that he was a real person with real friends and a job. He is Google-able. I checked to see his high school or college to see if he was a friend of Nick's and there was no schools listed, only current employment. Also, he lives in the Midwest, in a state where I know no one. Most everyone I know lives on the East Coast.

Anyway, I accepted the friend request and asked how this guy knew and found me, and the first thing I got back from him was a long and VERY explicit erotic story using my name as the main character. Considering how he messaged it to me right away, it was clearly written already and waiting for me. I took a screenshot, blocked him instantly and have since regretted it because I wish I could look at his profile and find his connection to Nick.

Honestly, I feel like there was no way this isn't all Nick. Even if that wasn't his FB profile, I feel like it's someone he knows and he put him up to this. He and I have never talked about wet T-shirts or Catwoman, but I also don't know anyone else who would be interested in sexually harassing me right now except for him.

So, yeah, that's my update. I honestly have no idea if I have a move here at all, since everything happened mostly anonymously on social media. I've asked around about the Facebook guy and even asked Gabrielle, but no one knows that name. I have made excuses to avoid future dinners at my parents' home and will continue to do so. I'll see them on my own, when Nick isn't around.

There hasn't been any online harassment since then, but I won't be surprised if another incident pops up sometime soon. Not sure how and where it'll happen, but I'm hoping it will include a slip-up that points me toward Nick because right now, I got nothing.

  **tl;dr**: My BIL made another weird sexual joke in front of me, and is also likely the one behind sexual harassment aimed toward me through social media."

I just realized I hadn't come back to this one! Oops.

I brought the issue up to my professor after class one day, but I was nervous and glossed over the important parts, so she didn't really understand how bad things were. As the end of the semester was closing in, I thought that was it.... but it wasn't.

Our final project was a thirty page paper. As most of the work had to be done outside of class, we divided the assignment into chunks, one for each person, to make it less of a nightmare. My job was to take the pieces, including my own, and edit them into a final whole.

James, the only group member who hadn't been prodding me about drugs and alcohol, did his part and sent it to me immediately. I finished my part and started working on the editing, but the other members of the group were curiously silent. I sent polite, and then not so polite reminders that I needed their pieces to finish the project. I heard nothing back.

In the end, James and I pulled two consecutive all-nighters to finish the paper. Still no contact from the other group members. James and I went in the day of the deadline and presented our paper, absolutely fuming. It went as well as it could have, even with the other group members around (they were pretending like nothing had happened, of course). We stayed back after class and told the professor everything, in detail. She was horrified, and after examining the paper, failed them both on it.

James and I got a collective A+.

**tl;dr:** Professor is a badass. Group project members were deadbeats in more ways than one and failed the final project. I haven't heard from them since, and I like it that way."
"My new neighbors [40'sM/F] have called emergency services at least 20 times in the last 2 months, usually in the middle of the night. I [20'sF]want tactfully want to ask if everything's alright without looking selfish.


Sorry in advance, I know how terrible this must sound.

I've lived in my apartment building for 3 years now with no issues. Most of the tenants are older or have families, so it's a pretty quiet building. About 2 months ago, a couple moved in right next to me. I introduced myself, they seemed really nice, no issues there. However, almost immediately, emergency services started getting called, and now at least 3 times a week I wake up in the middle of the night to hyper-bright flashing lights outside my window, and my dog barking at the EMT's and cops running up and down the stairs. The first week or so I was very concerned, there was obviously a big issue that wasn't getting resolved. However, it's still happening, and my concern has turned into irritation. Last night I woke up to my dog alerting me at 3am, looked outside and there were 2 cop cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance. It took almost a half hour for all the commotion to die down, and by then I was completely awake.

I feel bad bitching about someone having to call the police, but it's getting excessive, and my neighbors are also starting to get antsy about it. I'm wondering if there's anything I can politely say to ask if they're alright, and maybe subtly point out that everyone in the building wakes up when they call the cops.

tl;dr: New neighbors call emergency services at least 3 times a week, usually in the middle of the night, and the blaring lights and commotion wake everybody up. It's been 2 months and everybody's fed up with it.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses, I've decided to bring it up with my landlord and leave it be. The neighbors are very nice otherwise, and I definitely am not going to bring it up with them. I get little Christmas gifts for everyone in my building every year, so I'll give them my info then and tell them to let me know if they ever need anything. They don't bother anyone other than calling 911 a lot, so I don't forsee a problem with this. Cheers!"

"Me [21F] with random girl in my dorm [19F] making concerning (false) accusations to campus therapist about my relationship- HELP!


I'm a 21 year old female, senior in college. I've been with my boyfriend, 22M, for almost two years. We've had our ups and downs like any relationship, but overall it's been truly wonderful. He's the first person I loved and we have plans to move in together once I graduate. 

Without going into too much detail, our sex life has been truly out of this world amazing. We're long distance until I graduate, but when we do see each other, it's sex 3+ times a day and it's amazing. It's passionate, it's wonderful, I can't get enough. We both like some light BDSM but nothing crazy. 

I use the Mirena IUD for birth control, aka one of the most effective contraceptives on the market. Since we are in an exclusive relationship, we don't use condoms. We got STD tested before ditching the condoms, and my gyno does an STD check at every visit. We are both clean.

Anyway, after a few drinks one night I was talking to a good friend of mine about how great our sex life is. I didn't go into a ton of detail but at some point in the convo, it was mentioned that we only use my IUD for protection. Like a bat out of hell, a girl I never met jumps into our conversation and begins to lecture me about how irresponsible I am being. Maybe I shouldn't have been having this type of conversation in a semi public place, that is my fault. Dumbfounded, I pretty much laugh in her face, truly thinking she was joking.

Well, she wasn't. She went off about how some STD's don't show up on tests, and what if my boyfriend were to cheat on me and give me something? I told her if I had any suspicion of him cheating on me I wouldn't be with him and I obviously have a huge amount of trust for him. She went on to basically say that all men are pigs and I should be careful. Again, I pretty much laughed in her face. Not very mature I know, but I was pretty tipsy and dumbfounded.

It turns out this chick lives on my dorm floor and is the vice president of our safe sex club on campus. 

Two days after this happened, I returned to my dorm to find two condoms slipped under my door and a paper with information about the meeting times/days for this safe sex club. How this girl found my room, I don't fucking know. Yes she lives on my floor but there's a decent number of dorm rooms on my floor! 

Again, really god damn fucking weird, but I brushed it off my shoulder cause I was leaving to see my long distance BF that day, so I was too excited to really care. 

That weekend I was with my boyfriend, things got a little more frisky than usual. He ended up taking a neck tie and choking me with it (totally consentual!), which was incredible but I guess I didn't notice how rough it was being used. That is until the next day I had marks on my neck. Whoops.

When I got back to school it was super late at night and I had not bothered to cover up with a scarf or makeup. I went to the communal kitchen to make some tea before bed and and what do you fucking know, crazy girl is there (on the other side of the room), and one of my friends too (not the same friend from the first incident). My friend made a comment to the effect of ""looks like you had a good time this weekend"" and I responded ""oh you know it"". I thought nothing of it. 

A few days later I get a call while in class from a number I did not know, but I could tell it was a university number. I figured it was my on campus job calling me and I waited until after class to listen to the voicemail. 

Imagine my surprise when it's one of the campus therapists telling me to call her back ASAP. I thought the worst... I thought someone in my family or my boyfriend had died and the therapist was about to tell me this. 

No... she had gotten a report from someone (she could not say who) that they were concerned that I was in an abusive relationship. Someone had some to her saying that I had bruises on my body and that I had made comments to the effect of being pressured to have unprotected sex. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I told the therapist thank you for the concern but that is bullshit and I am so mad at these accusations and I'm sorry someone wasted her time. 

I was LIVID. In pure rage mode I found this girls dorm room and banged on the door ready to scream at her- lucky for her she was not in her room. I spoke to my RA about the issue, and he said that I am not the first person to tell him about this girl sticking her nose in other peoples personal lives, but never to the extreme of my situation.

Apparently, she left campus the day I went to bang on her door to go home and will not be back till tomorrow morning. 

How the FUCK do I handle this? This has obviously gone beyond something petty. I wish I could have gotten my RA's advice but when I spoke to him we were both in a rush to go somewhere. How should I proceed? Could I get her in trouble for this?

TL;DR- girl is making serious and false accusations about me to the higher ups at my university."
