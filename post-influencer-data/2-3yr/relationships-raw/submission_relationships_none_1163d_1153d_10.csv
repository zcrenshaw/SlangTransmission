"[Update] I [30M] made a huge mistake/oversight, and really hurt my cousin [24F] right before my wedding. How do I fix this?


So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update.

The TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings.

Anyways, on to the update.

I was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship.

Anyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.)

My fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said ""So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin.""

Emily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship.

She had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) ""went bridezilla"" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.)

She also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for ""her screwup.""

Guys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot.

Molly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to ""quit being such a whiner"" and enjoy my wedding.

So the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation.

The wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty.

The only thing she asked was if the ""Blame Emily"" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come.

She actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the ""adults"" and ""younger kids"" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.)

**TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends.

**Minor Update to the update-** 

So... it turns out ""Molly"" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: ""Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?""

So going forward, please replace ""Molly"" with ""Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains.""

Oh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW!

She's still coming to game night though. :)"
"[Update] My [18] parents keep insisting that I'm gay and I'm getting tired of it.


Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rjhzw/my_18_parents_keep_insisting_that_im_gay_and_im/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rjhzw/my_18_parents_keep_insisting_that_im_gay_and_im/).

My first post left me very confused. I had a hard time believing it was possible to be *that* in denial about my own sexuality. I honestly considered deleting my post and try to forget about it because it just made me so uncomfortable. I didn't delete it but I tried to not think about it and just focused on what I was going to do about the bullying. It didn't really work though and a couple days after I was hanging out with my friend (the guy I asked why everyone thought I was gay) and he asked me about it and I sort of had a melt down. I told him I was confused about everything and that I wasn't sure anymore if I was straight and that his texts and your comments had really screwed with my head. He was great though and managed to calm me down. I felt a lot better after talking to him about it and when I got home I read your comments again and /u/lamamaloca 's comment

&gt;Considering your edit, you might want to engage in some self reflection about who you're actually attracted to. I can completely understand why they think you're gay, and this isn't about just engaging in stereotypes. This is about other people noticing signs in you of arousal and interest.

&gt;You don't need to tell me these things, but think about them for yourself: what do you think about when you masturbate? Do you get aroused around girls or guys? Who are you drawn to, where does your energy focus? Pay attention to how you feel and how your body responds when you interact with each sex. When you kissed your girlfriend, was it super exciting and physically arousing? How do you feel if you imagine kissing a girl? What if you imagine kissing a guy? To which did your body respond? Maybe both? Also don't discount the possibility of being asexual or demisexual but homoromantic (or possibly heterotomantic), that could make things more difficult to figure out.

The first time I read this comment it literally made me feel sick and the second time it made me feel sick as well. That night I actually took her advice though and for the first time in my life I actually imagined what it would be like to kiss a guy and I'm definitely not straight. I'm not sure if I'm bi or gay but I'm not straight. I've done a lot of reading and exploring after that night and it's been difficult to accept it but I feel like I've come a long way in a short time. 

I still think it's weird that I was that deep in denial about it though. My whole life I was 100% sure I was straight and then now I'm 100% sure I'm not straight. It's weird. I told my friend about it a few days ago and he was awesome about it. I knew he would be okay with it but I was still nervous. I haven't told my parents yet and I'll probably wait until I have it more figured out. I haven't decided what to do about the bullying though. I feel like it won't bother me as much anymore and maybe if they see that I don't really care they'll get bored of it. I just hope it doesn't get worse. 

I just wanted to update you guys and thank you for your advice and comments. It literally changed my life and I'm not sure how long it would've kept living in denial if it weren't for you guys, so thank you.

**tl;dr**: Neded advice on how to stop my parents insisting I was gay. Turns out I'm not actually straight."
"Update: My (29M) very rich GF (25F) of 8 months wants to pay for an expensive vacation for the both of us. I don't feel comfortable accepting.


Link to original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4um20k/my_29m_very_rich_gf_25f_of_8_months_wants_to_pay/

First of all I want to say thank you to everyone who contributed to my last post. I never expected it to blow up the way it did and get that many replies. After a while the number of responses got overwhelming and I was unable to reply to many of the later posts and/or questions. 

I do wanna clarify a few things which kept coming up in the last post. This situation for me has absolutely nothing to do with ""gender expectations"" or anything like that, that's just not who I am. I suppose I should have expected that response from this sub given so many of the posts are about cheating, abusive partners or people confused with gender stereotypes etc. 

With that out of the way I also should have clarified in my OP that I am not a big gift receiver in general. I feel uncomfortable even when my parents, friends or other family members splurge on me. I also want to point out that people kept on bringing up scaling of money in that $200 for me has the same value that 5k has for her. Yes, that's fine in theory but it can still be hard to comprehend in real life when I have never had that kind of money splurged on me or lived such a high class lifestyle. It's easier said than done when people were urging me to accept her proposal with grace. 

Anyway, here goes the actual update:
----------------------------------------------------------
Before posting my last post I had already decided that I was going to turn her down and I wanted to get advice on how to politely turn her down. After listening to the good people of this sub I opened my mind a little and decided to have a talk with her about our relationship, her money, and our finances moving forward with an open mind. 

She came over last night after work and we talked about her proposal. I told her I was incredibly thankful for her offer but in all honestly it did make me uncomfortable. I explained to her that it was because of my middle class background and the fact that I am not a big gift receiver in general. She cut me off right then and there and said she was sorry if she felt me uncomfortable and she was only coming from a good place. She revealed to me that growing up even she had feelings similar to mine because she viewed everything as her ""family's money"" and only after she matured later on in life did she start to not feel bad about her wealth and privilege, and simply starting enjoying it for what it is. She told me she has a standing offer from her father to work a cushy job in the family business but she still does understand the value of money and that's why she still works on her own. We then talked about her family's wealth and the impact it had on her past relationships. She told me that usually she's never offered to do something this big for anyone else but she only offered this because she really trusts me, respects me and has fallen for me hard. She mentioned that in her last relationship she kept everything 50-50 because she wasn't sure about the guy and their relationship got very toxic by the end because he simply expected her to pay for everything. She said she loves my ambition and wants me to  keep progressing in my career. 

All that being said, I asked her what it would mean for our relationship going forward if I accepted. We both decided that nothing changes, we keep on splitting it 50-50 as we have so far. She joked that she wouldn't let me off the hook for future dates/expenses this easily lol. For any future trips/activities we decided that we won't always go for the most expensive options or the most budget friendly ones and try to find more of a middle ground. 

Ultimately she insisted that because she had already made the offer I had to accept. I did with the compromise being that once we are there we are going to split everything else 50-50, she will let me treat her a few times, and we won't be splurging the way she is used to on vacations. 

I am really thankful that his happened and we both feel closer than ever. She will be coming over on Friday to spend the weekend with me and plan/book this trip. I couldn't be happier right now. 

**tl;dr: She came over, we talked about the money and the state of our relationship. I accepted her offer and we both feel a lot closer.** "
"UPDATE! Me (22F) with my boyfriend (26M) of 2 years; he's against the idea of getting a pet but I'm lonely and my job is stressful.


ORIGINAL: [reddit!]https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4u46o4/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_hes/

My first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I figured I'd update anyway, as it's a happy one.

The TL;DR of my last post was that, after recently moving cities and experiencing a lifestyle change (boyfriend started working 80-100 hours/week) I was feeling stressed out and drained from my job, which involves animal research, and thought that getting a pet would really help me (as it has in the past). Since we really don't have time for a dog, I wanted to get a cat, and while he initially agreed to it, my boyfriend sat me down 8 months ago and reiterated that he wasn't super into cats and that since I seemed to be adapting well if I would hold off on getting one. Since then, my mental health has gone down a little and I wanted advice on how to talk to him about it.

Firstly, I got a couple of PMs and comments telling me that my boyfriend doesn't have to work that much and that I shouldn't be okay with it. This is a little naive, people. Everyone that has his position works as much as he does and he loves his job, so he needs to put up with the hours for about 5 years until he's moved up the chain of command. So that's not really up for discussion and never has been. He loves his job and feels fulfilled at work, which is something I want for him.


ONTO THE UPDATE...


I got a lot (a looot) of comments that sort of told me off for wanting to make a plea for a pet that my boyfriend wasn't on board with so I initially decided not to broach the topic and keep it to myself. 

However, I guess I was closer to my breaking point than I realized because the next night when he got in at midnight, after having a long and stressful day that had put me in a bad headspace for the evening (even after going for a 5k run and lifting some weights) I just sort of had a breakdown in his arms. He was flabbergasted and worried and asked me what was wrong.

I sort of... snotted, hiccoughed, and cried as I told him that I felt really lonely and was upset that he'd asked me to hold off on the cat, that I was very sad that I interacted only with animals that hate me and that I can't get attached to all day, and that my colleagues find that their pets ground them; that I couldn't continue coming home to an empty house and that pets were really important to me.

He was very shocked to hear all of this, stroked my hair for a while, made me tea, ran me a bath, and said we'd have a serious talk when I got back from my conference (monday &amp; tuesday). I was a little put off by the fact that he wasn't talking about it right away (but understanding because by the time we got to bed it was probably 2am).

I was at my conference until last night, but when I got in at around 8PM, I was surprised that our condo door was open--my boyfriend was home (never happens)! I was even more surprised when he came to the door, grinning, with a big Maine Coon cat in his arms that I'm very familiar with--my childhood kitty that lives with my parents. 

Well, I was pretty much a mess after that, happy and sobbing all over Snuffles (Snuffles rather frantically twisting his body in 1000 bizarre ways trying to get away and thereby avoid salty tears and snot), and my boyfriend explained: we were ""borrowing"" Snuffles for the next 7 weeks from my parents. He then said with an even bigger grin that he was serving as my cat ""in the interim of waiting for your new Abyssinian kitten to age to 10 weeks, at which point we'll give Snuffles back and bring in the kitten.""

My heart was so full. I was surprised that he remembered my brief mention that I thought that an Abyssinian would be a good breed fit for us (not super vocal, very friendly, short hair, indoor cat). I definitely never expected him to pay for the cat or anything, but he has put a deposit down and I will go pick a kitten from the breeder's litter in the next couple of weeks!!

I asked him what had made him change his mind the full 180 degrees and he just sort of explained that he was only ever ""sort of"" against the cat and thought I had been doing just fine mentally, so I didn't need one, and just figured we'd get a dog once we'd moved out of the city centre in 5 years or so, once both of us have reduced our hours.

He also is still a little bit concerned that a cat isn't going to be a fix-all, so I made an appointment with a psychologist I used to see and will be driving to my hometown next week for a ""check in"" with her. 

I thought he didn't want a cat because his dad thinks they're an ""unmanly"" pet, so I asked him as much, and he rolled his eyes and said ""Look, the CEO of Snapchat can't even find a hotter partner than I can and he definitely isn't dating someone that is getting a PhD. There's literally nothing in the world that is a threat to my manliness"" 

Also, just like I thought (because I know my boyfriend well, not just a ""magical rationalization"" I ""made up just because [I] want a cat""), this morning I woke up to my boyfriend spooning Snuffles instead of me; he'll be fine having a cat. 



**tl;dr**: we good, he wasn't actually really against getting a cat, so we're getting a kitten, and in the meantime I get to hang out with my old buddy."

"Me (26F) with my soon to be SILs (23/25F). One is causing drama over my engagement ring and now wants proof from my fiance about its worth. I'm worried about what family I'm marrying into with my fiance (27M)


I've been with my fiance Michael for almost four years now and it's been a great relationship so far. He proposed a month ago and we are both really excited to start our lives together. Hes truly wonderful. His family, well... :/

Michael does not live in the same state as his family anymore and as a result I've only met his family a few times. He has said before that some of his family members can be weird and he was even hesitant for me to meet his siblings. 

His siblings (both girls) are apparently really spoiled rotten individuals. Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in  at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more) Michael was rarely allowed to attend social events at school or go out on weekends. he did all chores and his parents treated him very different than his sisters. His sisters were incredibly mean to him as teenagers. Basically he was pushed around like a literal peasant until he had enough money to move out and was able to receive grants and scholarships to go to school. It was a lot of luck that played a part in his being able to attend undergrad and grad. If not for outside help, I believe his family would have left him to rot whilst giving the sisters everything they ever wanted. 

Michael is now an engineer while his sisters have basic minimum wage jobs (nothing wrong with that) however his sisters have done all they can to pester Michael about borrowing money, making him feel ashamed that he makes more money than they do, and even going as far as to claim that they deserve the money more than Michael does. They ask him monthly for money, which I just learned a year ago after Michael confessed to me in shame that he had been giving them money to help them through a rough patch for the past few months. 

Apparently their mom and dad has refused to continue to support them to the large extent that they have been the past several years (maybe they finally got fed up, who knows) and now the sisters are looking to Michael. 

Tina, Michaels eldest sister, is being really difficult lately. Apparently, she is bitter that Michael has not been giving her anymore money. And she is acting very strange about Michael's engagement. Apparently, Michael ""should he thinking about his family first"" before thinking of getting married and spending a bunch of money on a wedding and a wife. His sisters should be put first, apparently.  Now, supposedly she is pissed over my engagement ring. 

This past weekend Michael and I went to visit the family and Tina and the whole family obviously learned about our recent engagement. I had never even met Michael's dad before because he travels so much for work. His mom seemed passive towards me and his dad kept asking me what my name was. It made me sad tbh. 

Tina remarked on the large size of my engagement ring. Later in the day, she pulled Michael aside and told him that she was really suffering financially along with the rest of the family, and basically said. She was shocked Michael was forking over thousands of dollars for my engagement ring and the wedding rather than help out his own family. She said ""you've only known this chick for what, a few years? You're already giving her everything while you give your own family nothing."" 

Well, Michael then informed her that my ring wasn't real diamond. It is moissanite, which I specifically wanted instead of a diamond. Michael could easily afford a diamond but we are saving our money and I liked the idea of moissanite. 

But, Tina didn't believe that and expressed such. She stalked over to me in the kitchen and made a huge scene in front of everyone asking to see my ring, and examine it. She tried to play it off jokingly but I could see through it, and at one point she made a grab for my left hand. I refused to hand over my ring and Tina got emotional and the other sister, Hannah, soon butted in and asked what my problem was, Tina just wanted to look, what do I have to hide, etc. I just tried to calm the situation down as best I could and Michael kept telling them to mind their own business.

Honestly, the whole thing was infuriating. We left after dinner to go stay in a hotel. Michael then told me how he thinks his sister is also jealous of me and my ring. Tina has  been engaged for over a year now with still no wedding planned, she was given a tiny ring. Albeit with a real diamond but it is very tiny. Mine, though fake, is big and sparkly and she remarked to him once that he had better not get me a prettier looking ring than she had. (Wtf?) Michael and I will be getting married fairly soon and she seems bitter that her own fiance has still not expressed a desire to start planning the wedding. She has also remarked in the past to Michael how I am too beautiful, and that my looks are somehow suspicious, and I'm just out to get his money. 

I make my own money as a nurse and I definitely am not using Michael for his money. 

Now, Tina has started creating all sorts of drama over this, posting on Facebook about how real men should know where their priorities lie, how real men stick by family and don't play with little girls who are gold diggers who only care about having a huge rock. One status said ""show me the paperwork and I might believe the ring isn't real lol"" and another one was some stupid quote about being distracted by shiny things that turn out to be coal in disguise. (Me I'm guessing lol) she commented ""lmao 😂😂😂"" on my instagram picture of my ring. I deleted the comment.

I only know this about her Facebook statuses because Michael showed me through his account. Tina deleted me off of everything and even blocked me. She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me and then listing all of the reasons. (I don't really love him. I'm a gold digger, Michael doesn't care about his family anymore) 
However at the end of the email she said she may consider believing Michael if she saw proof that my ring wasn't real.

Reddit, I'm at a complete loss as to what to do here. Michael is also shocked but not really because he is so used to his sisters' antics. He took my side and I appreciate that but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant. I think he just doesn't wanna create more drama. But I need him to draw hard lines here.

The thing is, I don't want Tina and Hannah coming along every few months asking for money and judging us. I don't want my marriage to involve their pettiness and begging. I won't give any of my hard earned money to them, that's for sure. I don't want Michael to either but I guess I can't force him not to. I just worry because that could be money our future children need. Or money WE need. 

How can I handle this situation? At this point I never wanna see the sisters again. 

   
**tl;dr**: crazy soon to be SILs are creating drama over my engagement ring, and telling everyone I'm a gold digger. "
"Updating on ""I'm [21F] having roommate problems because her [23F] boyfriend [23M] has a thing for me""


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rg674/im_21f_having_roommate_problems_because_her_23f/


I know not many people saw my other post but I wanted to update anyways. She took all of my food out of the kitchen and put it in my mini fridge which she unplugged and left shut in my bedroom so the whole fridge became a disgusting mouldy mess. She did that because she said she didn't want me in common areas of the apartment anymore if I couldn't dress appropriately (and I was just wearing normal shorts!) yet somehow she thinks it's perfectly fine to do coke with her friends off our kitchen island. She also wrecked my lululemon leggings with her nail file because they're apparently too provocative to be worn anywhere outside of the bedroom. She's insane. Her boyfriend broke up with her after that incident and I think it was for the best, he could do so much better. She went extra crazy after that and kept texting me that she knows I'm sleeping with him and that I asked him to break up with her.  


So I moved out. I really didn't want to because I loved my apartment but I didn't want to put up with her anymore and I found an even better apartment with friends I can actually live with. 


Thanks for the advice with my first question, to be honest I was a bit surprised so many of the comments were blaming me but nothing I did made her happy anyways so whatever.

"[UPDATE] My (23F) SO (22M) of 6 months is mad because I've asked him to contribute to my grocery bill.


First of all, I'd like to thank every single one of you who read my post and helped me - I never expected for it to blow up! 

Now onto the update:

After I made the [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pti4v/my_23f_so_22m_of_6_months_is_mad_because_ive/) everything was calm for a while. I've told him that I feel disrespected when he leaves everything lying around without cleaning it and also told him that I feel the same when he just eats all of my food without buying new stuff. He said he understood, apologized for overreacting and everything was fine! 

We had a small falling out because he threw a small chunk of meat on my rug by accident (it's one of those shaggy ones where you end up searching for stuff for hours) and I told him to pick it up immediately for the above mentioned reason and he refused to. He apologized and picked it up after he finished his meal. 

He also talked with me about his feelings and told me that he fears he might be depressed. We had a long talk about it and how he's always feeling exhausted, I suggested maybe just picking up running again because he absolutely loved it before. He did! It apparently even helped for a little while, but after 1 1/2 weeks he stopped doing that, too. 

We also talked about our vacation and he said he just couldn't afford it. He did go out with his friends a lot more, though. 

Which is kind of the reason I'm writing this right now, he never introduced me to his friends in our city. I have met every single friend of his in his hometown. 

I've met two of his friends in our city once, but that's it. The first time I've asked to get to know them or meet them was back in February, he always claimed they were busy and if they did go out somewhere it was ""just the people from our study group, sorry!"". I've listened to this for the past 4ish months. There is also a very attractive girl in his study group.

When I asked him if he wanted to go out today, he said he'd think about it. We haven't seen each other a lot lately since he's always studying or grabbing a beer with his study group. He promised me a few weeks ago that he didn't have to study as much anymore and that we'd have more time to go out and enjoy our time together. Hasn't happened yet. 

Twenty minutes later, while I was leaving to go grocery shopping, he said that he already had plans with his study group. He said that he waited to tell me until I had to leave because he ""didn't want me to annoy him"".

When I asked him who was going, he said ""John and the others"". I asked who ""the others"" were, turns out the attractive girl is joining them. I asked if I could join, since he's been promising me I'd get to meet them for the past 4 months. He said that I'm always asking (first time today) and that he doesn't want me to meet them today and besides, why do I always have to annoy him with my questions? 

I've calmly told him that I have never asked before if he could ask his group whether or not I could join and I'm just curious since he's spending a lot of time with them (up to 30 hours for studying, the occasional beer afterwards) and he's been promising for the fucking past 4 months. I've also told him that I wanted to get to know them because he apparently liked them, he refers to them as his friends even though he never truly talks about some of them in great detail. I bet you all can guess which one he doesn't talk about. 

A lot more stuff was said, but in the end we broke up because I said I wanted to know why he didn't want me to meet his friends and he couldn't come up with a good reason apart from ""Why do you need to?"". What the fuck?

Thank you guys for all your help. It's just been an hour since we broke up and I fear this post is a mess. I've already been doubting my decision to break up, which is why I came back and read all of your comments on the original post. 

TL;DR: Was close to breaking up after the original post but everything was calm for a while (probably because we haven't seen each other a lot?), broke up for unrelated reasons. "

My girlfriend [31F] is also divorced. She was also with her ex-husband [32M] for 10 years (dated for 3 and married for 7) and her divorce was also finalized a year before we met. My girlfriend filed for divorce because her ex-husband cheated with my wife’s younger sister [27F] and her sister got pregnant. When it came out that this happened, my girlfriend’s parents [50s?M&amp;F] and the rest of her family supported her sister and told my girlfriend she was overreacting (I’ve seen copies of the court transcript from her divorce so I know my girlfriend is not lying). They threw her sister a baby shower and were upset that my girlfriend didn’t attend and they chipped in to pay for her husband’s divorce lawyer. Her sister also moved in with her ex-husband after my girlfriend moved out of the house and had to buy her out of her half as part of the divorce settlement. Her mom told her they had edited her out of all the family pictures and ripped up the rest. My girlfriend cut contact and hasn’t seen, spoken or had contact with any person from either side of her family since she got divorced a year ago.

My girlfriend has moved on. She moved across the state, has a house, a new job and new friends and she was adopted by her mentor from in the military reserves so she could be legally severed from her parents. I have a great relationship with my family and they all supported me through my divorce. I can’t imagine how it must have felt to not have family support during that time. They didn’t even want her to divorce him and said the sister could just live in their basement and my girlfriend had to live in a hotel for a year when she filed and moved out because no one would take her in. Over the year we have been together my girlfriend has told me the story but I haven’t pushed her because it’s so painful obviously. She has her mentor, her friends from the military and her new friends but I get that it’s not completely the same. My parents [61M/56F] have met my girlfriend once now and soon my brothers [33/32M] and the rest of my family will be meeting her. With my girlfriend’s permission I have shared the gist of her story (not the details) with my parents and brothers. My parents loved her and I know my family wants her to feel as loved and welcome as possible. I want the same thing for her and I want to support her as much as I can. I love her but I’m a bit emotionally and feeling challenged and I’m not always the best with showing emotions and talking about stuff. It probably seems obvious to other people but I am unsure.

My questions are 1) What are some ways I can be supportive of my girlfriend as she keeps building her new life without her family and gets over the divorce? 2) What are things for me not to do? 3) My mom and dad and family want to make her feel welcome in the family but I have no clue how they can without doing it wrong.
tl;dr My girlfriend cut off contact with her family because they supported her sister and her ex-husband when her ex-husband got her sister pregnant. I want to support her and make her feel welcome in my family but I don’t know how and I don’t want to mess this up or hurt her by doing it wrong."

"My [39F] relatives are upset that my husband [46M] spends some time reminiscing about his first wife.


So, I met John ten years ago, and we got married six years ago.  He's wonderful, kind, loving, and funny. You wouldn't know otherwise that he's had a tragic past.

He got married to his sweetheart back in his home country, and was married to her for 15 years.  His country was torn apart by war, and it made the news at the time, until everyone forgot about it.  During this time, he lost his wife and first born daughter in a wartime casualty that both shocking and horrific. According to his surviving daughter, he has always been kind and strong, even when things got this bad.  She's living in another country, so she's not in our life much as a grown woman with her own life (she's an artist, so sweet), but she seems like her father.  John moved to our country about 12 years ago, shortly before I met him.  I found him amazing with bright eyes and stupid jokes that are also kind of endearing.  After a few years of courtship, we got married.  

My family has never been fond of him.  Partly due to our age difference, but also because he's a foreigner, although they won't admit it, and mask it under other things they think to pick on him about.  They correct his accent, make his hobbies (wood crafting, gardening) look un-masculine, and generally ""ehm ehm"" correct him when he says something wrong (usually mispronouncing words or making a malapropism) like he's a small child.  They don't care that he's gainfully employed with a good job as a teacher (now with tenure), that's he's a wonderful and caring husband.

The big one was when they found out that John remembers the anniversaries that his wife used to share.  There are four of them: her birthday, their wedding anniversary, his first daughter's birthday, and the day of her death.  I never minded this.  He was with her a long time, and his dedication is admirable.  And it's not like he always brings her up.  Sometimes she comes up in a story or two, but it's rarely about her.  I don't feel her as a competition, and the only things we have of hers are a few photos and some memorabilia in a box that he'll bring out on those special occasions.  She seemed like a wonderful woman, and I wish I could have met her.

The celebrations are short.  Usually a visit to church with a candle lighting, some prayers, and he visits a tree on the campus where he works and talks to it like it's his wife, since he has no grave to visit.  Then he usually gives a gift to the local homeless or food shelter in her or his late daughter's name.  I always help him, and he's always grateful.  He mentions me in the present tense when he talks to the tree, and he doesn't mind when I'm there, although sometimes he wants to be alone for half an hour or so, which I respect.  I suspect he cries a little.

Last year, we went to his home country and visited the area where she died.  It's now part of a shopping plaza built in the early 2000s.  Their economy has done well since the late 1990s.  It was a bit much for him emotionally, and he collapsed.  His daughter and I had to fly him back home early, and I confess, the event left me so drained I accidentally told my mother what happened.

Well, for a year now, they keep bringing it up.  ""You're just a surrogate,"" my older sister said.  ""That's so ghoulish,"" my father commented.  ""Is he retarded?  Like has the mind of a young boy?  Was his brain damaged by a shell casing or something?""  My mother is always trying to get me to distrust him.  ""I bet he wishes she was alive and you would be gone just like that,"" with a snap of her fingers.  They tell me that as a second marriage, I married ""used goods.""  That's particularly hurtful because I divorced my first husband, which they said was a mistake, and also he was our race.  But I left him because he was so cold and distant, and wanted lots of children, but I could never conceive.  ""Am I used goods?""  Well, I shouldn't have asked THAT!  My ex is still friends with my family, and I suspect he's ""biding his time"" to take me back, but no thank you!  I wish my ex would find another woman and have all the babies he wants with her, but I suspect unless someone does it for him, he'll still be at all the family gatherings.

I love my family, I really do, but they are so frustrating.  They are very traditional and so they view me as some kind of wayward lost little girl who should have stayed married, had lots of kids with a stoic husband, and definitely not have gotten a divorce and married a foreign teacher who talks to a tree 4 times a year (they don't know that part, can you IMAGINE?).  It's making family gatherings uncomfortable and I miss the fun we used to have. 

Am I so strange to love this man?  Am I a fool?

**tl;dr** My husband remembers his late former wife and daughter few times a year, and my family thinks I am stupid to be married to this man."

"(UPDATE) Me [22 F] lesbian feeling resentful towards my straight friends, but I don't want to be!


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nf3kz/me_22_f_lesbian_feeling_resentful_towards_my/

First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to my first post.  Your words of encouragement and hearing your experiences was so helpful to me and made me feel understood and much less alone.  I thought I would share this update with you guys.

On to the update.  I decided to take the advice of a lot of you and go to a gay event.   I went to an dance club event for lesbians and saw a beautiful girl dancing by herself at the wall.  Somehow I built up the courage to talk to her (don't even remember what I said to start the conversation) and we ended up dancing for a bit and then talking for about an hour outside.  It was an amazing conversation and we both basically shared our life stories.  She was smart, funny, cool, etc.  Basically all the good qualities you could ask for.

I got her number and asked her out the next day.  She said yes (!!!!) and we went mini golfing in the city and then by some miracle she agreed to come back to the place I was housesitting. We were just chilling under the stars on the patio drinking wine and then we started making out which led to me finally having sex.  It was an awesome experience but I was shocked by how physically exhausting it was.  Then we cuddled all night and went out for breakfast the next day.

Now we talk every day and go out as often as we can.  I've never liked someone that liked me back before, and it is honestly mindblowing.  I haven't been this happy in years.  Only liking straight girls for my entire life was rough, but suddenly, being gay doesn't feel so bad.  I'm being cautious with my feelings in case things don't work out, but just knowing that it's possible to have these experiences is enough for me right now.  

I really owe you guys for all your help.  Thank you!!!!!!


---   
**tl;dr**: Ended up taking your advice and went to gay event, met amazing girl and now we are basically dating!!!!

Edit: Some people have commented about the housesitting part; I'm very close with the owner of the house. She knows about my situation and was actually rooting for me to get laid lol.  "
"The fiance [30sM] of my best friend [29F] wants me [29F] to stop calling her the nickname I gave her. I don't know how to diplomatically tell him no.


So there's me [29F], my best friend [29F], and her fiance [30sM]. They just got engaged last week. I'm going to be her maid of honor. Yay!

Her fiance is fine. We're not BFFs or anything, but he's cool. He's kind of a socially awkward nerd, and it's hard to get him to open up without bringing up what he's most interested in (what he does for a living, whatever TV show he's watching) and then the conversation with him can get a little one-sided.

My best friend and I have been friends since we were 15. Five-ish years ago (before my best friend started dating her fiance), she and I watched The Wire together. We both now consider it our favorite show.

Anyway, after watching that show, I started calling her, 'D' as a nickname, because, well, her name starts with D, and also, there's a character we both liked who was also called 'D.' I almost exclusively call her by her nickname now. 
   
(WARNING. There's a spoiler for the Wire in the following paragraph, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't keep reading!)

I got this very unexpected message from her fiance last night on Facebook. He told me that now that he and D are getting married, he kindly requests that I stop calling her by the nickname I gave her, as it's ""not a very mature way of addressing her. I would hate to think you calling her that during your speech at our wedding."" He also went on to say that he never approved of that nickname anyway, because the character gets murdered in the show and he ""doesn't like that imagery associated with my future wife.""

I'm not the most diplomatic person, so I don't entirely know to respond. I'm not even entirely sure if I should say anything at all. There's, hahaha, also part of me that wants to send back, ""Sure, no problem, bro. I'll just start calling her Bodie instead. Or maybe Omar. Oh, I know, I'll start calling her Snoop! Snoop would be a *great* fit for her!"" A similar part of me wants to agree with him, and then during their wedding, just use her nickname constantly during my speech. And there's another (admittedly, angrier) part of me that wants to say, ""What? Are you kidding me? No. Request denied. Oh, and fuck you. Don't ever dictate to me how I should interact with my best friend."" 

There's also this weird...possessiveness associated with his wording the message. He never calls her by her name, just a lot of ""*my* future wife"" and ""*my* fiance."" My best friend is fiercely independent, and I know she wouldn't appreciate being talked about like that. So maybe I should forward the message on to her saying something like, ""Hey...your fiance just sent this to me and I don't really know what to make of it.""

EDIT FOR AN IMPORTANT DETAIL THAT I FORGOT TO ADD: My best friend and I are both bisexual, and we have made out in the past. Just made out. A good handful of times in high school (we were like, ""We need to practice for our future boyfriends!"" but now that we're older, we laugh about all that now and are like, ""Right. Yeah. 'Boyfriends.' Sure. Uh huh."") and, I dunno, four or five times in college (while drunk at parties). 

We had talked about dating each other, but, I dunno...we love each other, but I don't think we would ever be *in love* with each other. We're pretty different people, which is why I think we make such good friends, but not terribly good significant others. The last time we talked about being in a relationship was, like, I dunno, 8 years ago?

It's now only just occurring to me that maybe this has something to do with her fiance's unexpected message...

Any advice would be appreciative. Thanks, y'all.

**tl;dr**: My best friend's fiance has asked me to stop calling her a nickname I gave her before the two of them even started dating. I don't know how to kindly tell him to shove it.

UPDATE: Well! I just got off the phone with D. She called me, I started to answer like I usually do, (""'Sup, D?"") But then, remembering that maybe she doesn't want to be called that anymore, I just sort of awkwardly extended the 'D' sound into her full name (so I answered like, ""'Sup Deeeeeeeee[full name]?"")

She immediately said, ""[Fiance] told you to stop calling me D, didn't he?""

I said yes, and she exclaimed, ""What the fuck, I can't believe he actually fucking did that! Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later. And *don't* stop calling me D.""

""You got it, D.""

We said our goodbyes and she hung up. Soooooooo...I think *someone* mighta crossed a line...

UPDATE 2: I just tried to post an update, but it was immediately deleted because this post is still on the front page. Long story short, D's fiance crossed a line, they got into the most ridiculous fight, and she is at my place right now. Not entirely sure when (or if) she's going to go back home. I'll post a proper update as soon as this one is no longer on the front page."
"My (39f) friend (39f) of 20 years babysat for me. Her kid (10f) opened a bunch of brand new toys I had stashed away. I'm angry at my friends (lack of) reaction and can't get over it.


A few weeks ago,  my friend called and asked if her family of 4 could stay with us for a week,  or two.  They had to move from their current rental and didn't yet have another lined up. 

They stayed 9 days.  It was hectic,  but my home is large and we kind of agreed to keep our lives separate (meals,  watching TV,  etc). We have a massive basement that is pretty much an apartment.  Things went okay. 

As a thank you,  she offered to babysit for me while I had jury duty.  It was 2 days after they left.  She came over with her 2 kids and babysat my kids. 

When I got home,  the first thing I noticed was candy wrappers all over the lawn.  All the kids were playing outside.  The hose was laying in the driveway,  turned on. 

When I went in the house,  I was shocked to find a total mess.  Dishes piled in the sink.  Chip bags,  empty cookie packages,  pop cans... 

I went to the basement to grab a box she left here and I couldn't believe the state of things.  It looked like they took toy bins and just threw them in the air.  

I keep a cupboard of new toys in a closet in the basement - things for my kids,  or birthday parties,  or Christmas presents.  The closet/cupboard was open and every single toy was open/laying on the floor. 

I realized the candy wrappers outside were from a gingerbread kit I had in the closet.  Went outside and looked,  and sure enough,  the entire kit was laying across the lawn.  Empty frosting bags,  gum drops,  tootsie rolls... 

I came inside and asked all the kids who was responsible.  My kids (5f) ratted out the daughter (10f) of my friend.  She was playing on the computer and barely looked up to say,  ""I didn't know I wasn't supposed to."" 

I yelled for my friend and explained the situation.  She rolled her eyes and said,  ""Oh boy.  Do you want some money?"" 

My friends husband pulled up and beeped.  They all got up and left.  As she walked out,  my friend said,  ""do you want us to come back later and clean?"" 

I said not to bother. 

I haven't talked to her since.  I'm angry.  Every time it crosses my mind,  I get mad.  I'm unhappy with her reaction.  I'm unhappy that she didn't apologize,  or even really react.  

I'd guess there was about $200 worth of toys in there (monster high dolls,  a science kit with microscope,  some bead jewelry kits).  It isn't about the money,  but I feel like the quantity of toys matters. 

For what it's worth,  her family struggles financially and we do pretty okay.  I wouldn't even accept money from her.  I just felt like she thought I was being petty because we do okay financially. 

Lastly,  where the hell was she all day? How did all this happen under her nose? I'm pissed about that too.  She wasn't watching the kids. Plus,  she jokes that I'm rigid and a neat-freak all the time -  so how could she leave me such a mess? 

Should I just forget about it? Confront her? 

Tl;dr: my friends family stayed at my house for 9 days while searching for a new place.  As a thank you,  she volunteered to babysit my 2 kids while I had jury duty.  My house got destroyed,  every bit of junk food was eaten,  and my toy stash (unopened toys stashed away for birthdays,  christmas) was raided by her 10yo daughter.  

She rolled her eyes when I told her what happened.  I'm angry at her reaction.  I'm angry that my house got trashed.  I don't think she really watched the kids. Should I say something,  or let it go?

SUPER LONG EDIT:  a few things - for clarity,  a pipe burst at her house and the landlord wanted 3k to repair it.  She offered $1,500. He refused.  That's why they were homeless. 

She also just started a new job.  The night before babysitting,  her new work-issued cell phone was stolen from her cart at a grocery store. 

She cashed in her 401k to use as a down payment to buy a home.  However,  the bank refused her mortgage. So,  they were back to hunting for a rental.  Plus,  she has a deadline to return the 401k money. 

Considering all of this,  I'm thinking she probably spent all day on the phone,  trying to fix these things.  When I got home and said my 'extra toys'  were destroyed,  her reaction was probably just exhaustion. Like,  what more could go wrong? 

It wasn't until I posted this that I really reflected on what a good person she really is,  and how out of character this is for her.  She's just going through a hard time. 

I cant tell you how much I appreciate the shift in perspective.  I'll still tell her how upset I was,  but I'm not angry anymore.  Thanks,  reddit! "
"[Update]How do I [F25] tell my MIL [F60's] that I don't want to go to a religious retreat with her?


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sgolv/how_do_i_f25_tell_my_mil_f60s_that_i_dont_want_to/)

Well, my husband and I sat down with my MIL and told her the whole truth. I told her that I don't identify with the subject matter, and that I won't get anything out of the retreat so I won't be going, but that I would be willing to go to another retreat. I was honest with her about my beliefs (that they are not Christian) and I told her that I know how important her faith is to her life and I respect that, and I asked for respect in return and that I have other things in my life that take that importance. 

It went...poorly. She doesn't understand how I don't relate to the core material (The central idea being ""Every woman longs for three things: to be swept up into a romance, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to be the Beauty of the story."") I told her that I relate much more strongly to the ""male"" counterpoint to the retreat (Adventure! Battles! Beautiful damsels in distress!) and I also told her that I resent how focused both books are on a man and woman's heart being only these things and fitting perfectly together and only with each other (I have a gay brother, and she has a gay sister, talk about a slap in the face). My husband told her that he doesn't feel that the subject matter for the men fit him either, and that we feel like opposite genders in the eyes of this ministry. I cut down trees for a living, my husband writes and plays beautiful music and is the most impeccable host you've ever met. 

Anyways, I'm getting away from myself. My MIL was upset to our faces, and kept making us answer *why* we didn't feel that way, and then when we explained why again, she said that it's not all like that. When she got home, she called my husband and told him that she had no idea how ""manly"" I was, and expressed disappointment on him marrying a woman of no faith. He told her off, and now we aren't talking to them. I'm sure she'll get over it, but how exhausting. 

Tl;dr - My MIL thinks I'm manly for not wanting to be the damsel in distress. "
"[Update] I [20] think that my mother [50F] is trapped in a cult lead by her best friend [50F]


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4psqsl/i_20f_think_that_my_mother_50f_is_trapped_in_a/


I was hoping to have a good update, but crap just hit the fan. All this went down less than an hour ago.



My siblings were watching the new Netflix show Stranger Things when my mom walked in. She asked them what is was, then left the room. She came back and told them to leave. My brother saw a strange look in her eye so he stayed in the room. He looked away for a brief second and she dropkicked his X-Box, then slammed the TV to the floor and stomped on it. He grabbed her and held her down as the rest of us returned to the room, screaming. She was “praying” under her breath and ordering him to let go. He refused.



She was proud of what she did, probably thinking that she was saving our souls from demons or some such spiritual threat. She told me to leave. I refused, telling her I was worried about her hurting herself. Her leg was bleeding from the shattered glass of the TV. She broke her glasses trying to break free from my brother. My little sister called my dad, and he came home immediately. He grabbed my mom and led her to their room and told my brothers to stop screaming and swearing. We were all upset and afraid, not about our stuff being broken (it’s just stuff, who cares?) but because our mom had turned into a monster before our eyes.



My parents talked in their room for a while, then my dad came out and talked to me and my brothers. He was mad that they swore and says it’s unChristian and that he didn’t raise them that way. He thinks its disrespectful. He doesn’t condone what my mom did, but he also says some of our TV/movie/video game/music choices are not OK in his eyes either (sigh). He says his vision for his family didn’t come true and that he’s ""failed as a spiritual authority.” My brothers said they were swearing because they were scared and excited and meant no disrespect. My dad doesn’t swear at all and can’t understand this. I repeatedly tried to deescalate the rising tension. I repeatedly told my dad that not just my mom, but all of us needed counseling. We need a neutral third party with professional experience to sort through all these problems. He winked and said he was working on a plan to take care of my mom’s issues, but we kids need to learn to be more respectful (?!!). He says he's considering counseling, so I'm slightly relieved.



However, neither of my parents leave any room for disagreement with their kids. If we kids like or believe something that they consider unChristian, it’s unacceptable and they think less of us and treat us like less. I keep quiet so my relationships with them are not as strained as theirs with some of my siblings. I am the oldest child so I have to lead. It’s so hard. This is the worst day of my life so far.

Thanks for reading.

"Me [26F] with my cousin [22/23F] who's been in my life for years. She's horrible. She's abusing her kids and has a warrant out for her. She's fleeing the state and family is helping her do it. Wondering if I should just tip off police and be done with it.


So a little background: When I was a child my paternal grandma adopted three girls from her very extended family. They were living with an abusive mom and grandma didn't want to see the girls go through the foster system and live with the state. She gave them beautiful lives and they grew up with every opportunity under the sun. The youngest two went off to educate themselves and live pretty decent lives. The oldest, Kristi, did not. 

Kristi was always the favorite and never given strict rules or boundaries. She dropped out of high school her freshman year and sold drugs for years. She'd take them as well and stash them in my grandma's house. She was trading/selling illegal weapons and prostit uting herself for drug money. Despite my grandma's best efforts to rehabilitate her, those efforts were in vain as the problems kept getting worse and worse. Eventually Kristi got knocked up at 17 by one of their state's most wanted for murde r and other charges and actually ended up having 3 kids with her.

She neglected and abused all three of those kids. She'd drug them for fun and they'd watch as her boyfriend beat her on numerous occasions. She turned their room into a BDSM dungeon and made them live in the large coat closet in the trailer my grandma bought for them to live in and men would come over every day. She'd tell her daughters that they can measure a true man by who beats them the best and would go long extended periods without feeding or changing them. Finally, their small town police station stepped in.

She was taken to jail and the kids were re-homed with grandma. Grandma was given the option to give the children up to the state but refused and instead signed a paper saying she'd act as their guardian and not allow their mother to see them again. She's in her 70's and in failing health and couldn't watch all three, so she actually gave Kristi's biological mom (the abusive one) the youngest to hold onto. She violates the paper and lets the kid's mom see them all the time and always goes to get her out of jail and let's her stay with them because she's scared to send her back to her house.

The enabling behavior is exhausting because those kids are terrified of being around their mother. Last I visited, the oldest boy who is now five clung to my leg and asked if I could take him to the shower for his bath because he was scared monsters would hit him from the dark hallway. I was so upset with that visit. I told my grandmother that by holding onto those kids and not allowing them to properly go through foster care and be adopted out that she was doing more harm than good, because by the time she inevitably passes and they are preteens or teenagers they'll go through hell with the state system. Of course, I went un-listened to. 

The visit was short because I didn't realize that it was that bad and left and was glad I didn't bring my own two children with me because it would've been one hell of a thing to explain. My family has given up on all of them. Kids included. I found out yesterday that Kristi fled the state because there's a warrant out for her drug selling and apparently suspected m urder. My grandma is covering for her and paid her bus fare to get her out of the state and plans to take the kids to see her.

Would it be wrong and terribly out of line for me to get involved and drop some kind of tip that this girl is avoiding her warrant and these kids are in danger and negligence? Funny enough the county CPS is involved but seemingly turning a huge blind eye to a lot. They live in a small town and the police can easily be bought.

I recognize that it might not be my place which is why I'm here asking for advice on what I should do. Any advice would be helpful and I'll try to respond to everything as best as I can.

**TLDR: My cousin is a horrible person. I call her my cousin, but she's my adopted aunt. She had her kids taken away and they live with someone who still lets her torment them. She has an active warrant out but is being helped with fleeing the state to avoid it. Enough is enough. Wondering if I should get involved just to get her ass thrown in a cell and inform the state that the kids are broken up and still in a negligent situation. Needing advice**"

Some relevant background info: I make a very good living myself and earn slightly over 6 figures and come from a basic middle class family. I live a comfortable life and manage my money wisely. My GF of 8 months comes from a very rich family (like 0.1% rich). Salary wise she makes less than half of what I make but receives an allowance from her family's business every month. She doesn't even touch her salary and says that it gets accumulated into her savings account. She lives off of her monthly allowance from her family business. Relationship wise we are very compatible so far. I really like her and she likes me. She told me about her family's wealth about 4 months into the relationship when she felt safe and comfortable with me. Up until now we split all our expenses/dates 50-50. 

Recently we talked about going on a vacation and we decided on Western Europe since I have never been there and I think vacations are good tests of the relationship, and help move the relationship forward. I can afford the trip on my own if we go the ""normal route"" where we book economy tickets to fly and look for Airbnb/hotel deals. She wants to fly first class and stay in 4-5 star hotels. The differences in the rates between Airbnb/lower end hotels vs. 4-5 star hotels is staggering to say the least (without even getting into the airfare). I told her that I simply could not afford that and she offered to pay for me. She said I could pay her what I would have spent on an economy class airfare ticket + hotels in my range and she will simply pay the difference. 

This makes me uncomfortable. As generous as her offer is I don't think I am at the stage of the relationship where I can accept such a huge gift from someone. The difference according to my calculations will be over 3k and could be as much as 5k once we actually book. That's simply too much for me to accept. I want to politely decline her offer and see if we can work out a compromise. 

tl:dr: My GF of 8 months wants to pay for an expensive vacation. I want to keep things more ""affordable"" for myself without relying on her. Not sure what do here. "
"My best friend [25F] has been ignoring me for a year and now wants me [25F] to give her fiance a job.


I met my best friend ""Sarah"" on our first day of college and we lived together for the following three years. After college I moved to LA to work in film and she moved home with her parents to save up for grad school. I haven't seen her in person since graduation, but for the first year after college we texted every day, spoke on the phone often, and Skyped almost weekly. This continued until she randomly cut off contact with me out of the blue. I eventually got so worried about her that I called her mom, who awkwardly apologized and told me that Sarah's been spending time with her new boyfriend.  


After four months of not hearing a word from her, she finally texted briefly to tell me about ""Joe."" From the little she's told me and what I've gathered from his Facebook, Joe is an abrasive, homophobic misogynist. Sarah's very forward-thinking, but has a history of picking disrespectful boyfriends. This latest one seems to be sticking: I saw on FB a few weeks ago that they're engaged. Obviously I was really hurt that I had to find out through social media. But it gets worse-- 


I've been fortunate career-wise and a few months ago I got hired to write a big budget movie for a major studio. An interview I did got shared by one of our mutual friends, which I assume is how Sarah saw it. Yesterday I got a message from her asking if I could get Joe a job. Apparently he wants to be a TV writer. Nowhere in her message did she congratulate me or ask how I'm doing. 


Obviously I have no intention of trying to get Joe a job, but I can't help it-- I really want my friend back. When she's not in a relationship, Sarah is the greatest, most supportive friend ever. It's like she transforms into somebody I don't know as soon as she gets a boyfriend. Is there any hope for our friendship, or is it time to say goodbye for good?

"My [24F] boyfriend [29M] of 3 years is inexplicably angry and jealous of me singing to women


This is absolutely doing my head in so I hope you can help. I've never posted here before but heard a friend talk about it a few times.





My boyfriend James is a normal, sane human being (well I thought so anyway) with a stable job in the medical industry and has, before now, shown no signs of being, well, nuts. He's also shown no signs of being homophobic in any way.


SO. I am a fairly decent singer and recently (6 months) ago started booking gigs on the weekends at events, weddings, bars/clubs and such. They pay me and I sing covers of songs, do requests, stuff like that. Great, I love singing, I can make money on doing it - fantastic. 


Ever since the first gig James came to, we've had problems. He sat through most of my performance, was great when I had breaks and generally seemed happy. A few friends were there too and everyone said I did great. Until I got to a song near the end. The song isn't that important but for the record it was ""Let Her Go"" by Passenger (you may know it) the song is clearly written about a woman, the lyrics have references i.e. ""*You see her when you close your eyes*"" ""*Only know you love her when you let her go*"" ETC. It's a pretty popular song, anyway. So during this song my boyfriend gets up and goes to the bar. I kind of notice it out of the corner of my eye but don't take much notice. And he's quiet for the rest of the night until we get home. 


When we get home he is angry/pouting and I can tell but don't really know why. So we get into bed and he tells me that he doesn't want me singing ""those kind of songs"" anymore because it's ""disrespectful to our relationship"" and ""sends the wrong message"". I was like WTF. Firstly I asked him to clarify the song, then when he told me which one I genuinely thought he was kidding. Because he surely couldn't be objecting to me singing ""her"" or ""she"", right!? No, wrong. He was angry that I was singing to a woman. 


So by this point I am now fuming because who is he to tell me what to sing and also this is insane in my mind so I pretty much said alright buddy you're being ridiculous, and went to sleep hoping that was the end of it. 


It wasn't.



In the past 6 months he has come to 6-8 gigs of mine and every time I sing a song with reference to a woman in, he storms out. It is causing huge problems between us and I do not understand it. We will argue afterwards about he. He insists is isn't homophobia, but he won't give me another reason other than that it isn't respectful to the relationship. I refuse to stop singing popular songs that I enjoy singing because they have ""she/her"" in them, or pulling a musical no-homo and changing it to ""he/him"" (as he suggested - he's FINE with me singing about men but not women - because it could be about him I suppose). I think it's absolutely ridiculous! 


So this all came to a head on Saturday night when I had a gig and an Ed Sheeran song was requested. There were a lot of references to ""her/she"". WELL I'm sure you can guess how well that went down. Now we aren't speaking and I don't know what to do.


I love this man. He has never shown ANY signs of jealousy or controlling behaviour, including if a man has made a comment or something at a bar. He has no problems with men coming up and saying hi after my sets etc. Am I overreacting or being stubborn? Should I just back down on this one for the sake of the relationship?


I have tried to think of any sane reason he might hate it but I can't think of one. Reddit, please help!!


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend thinks me singing songs with ""she/her"" should be replaced with ""he/him"" because it is disrespectful to our relationship

Edited - formatting


**Edit - sorry guys, I only got a few responses in the first 1-2 hours but this has blown up overnight. Thank you all so much for your responses, I am reading them and will respond some. To the many people who said this is insane - thank you for agreeing. I thought I was going nuts here.**"

"My dad (M61) found out something about my (M28) and my boyfriend’s (M24) sex lives, and I think it has changed the way he treats my boyfriend. Is there a problem here?


Okay reddit, this is a very weird situation that I find myself in. I’m not even entirely sure that there’s a problem at all, to be honest. My apologies in advance for what will probably be a fairly long post.

I have been with my boyfriend for three years and we have a wonderful relationship. He’s smart, funny, and beautiful – we’ve talked about getting married and I can see myself proposing to him in the next year. A few weeks ago we went out to our city’s Pride parade, and at one of the stands they were giving away rainbow stickers with various words written on them, e.g. gay, proud, but also funnier ones that said things like twink, bear, daddy and more. As a joke, I slapped a sticker that said ‘top’ on myself and one that said ‘bottom’ on him (for those of you not in the know, that’s gay slang for the giver and receiver of anal sex). It was funny, we both laughed because it’s true, and then we went on enjoying the parade – in the process completely forgetting about the stickers.

Anyway, after the parade my parents had invited the two of us over for a summer barbeque. I adore my boyfriend’s parents but my relationship with my own is somewhat strained. They’ve never been particularly religious but have put a lot of emphasis on tradition and are pretty white picket fence-y. My dad is a blue collar guy and my mom is a SAHM. Because I played a lot of sports they were blindsided when I came out as gay in university, and their reactions weren’t great. My mom cried a lot and said she wanted me to have grandkids. My dad was even more devastated, I think because in his eyes I had become less of a man despite the fact that nothing had actually changed. We stopped going fishing, camping and to car shows together like we had for years. It sucked, but I toughed it out and had school to focus on. Over the last five years or so my parents’ attitudes have improved and we’re now somewhere between cordial and friendly. 

I’m sure you’ve all figured out where this story is going. My dad picked us up from the train station (they live in the suburbs, the parade was downtown) and lo, we still have the stickers on. He must have spotted them right away because he was stiff, awkward and flustered for the whole ride. When we got out of the car I was able to subtly pull my boyfriend aside and remove the sticker. He was embarrassed and hoped my dad hasn’t seen. The dinner went fine after that, but since that day my dad’s behaviour has changed markedly. In only a few weeks there have already been several weird incidents:

1)	The day after my dad called me up and asked if I wanted to go on a fishing trip with him some time in the summer. I was shocked, since that literally has not happened since the day I came out seven years ago, but also pleased, and I said yes.

2)	My mom called me to ask if my boyfriend wanted to come to a Shakespearean play with her and my sisters. The play is a few hours’ drive away at a well-known theatre festival, so it would be a day trip. They do this trip once or twice a year, but have never invited any of my boyfriends or me before, and it's usually been a sort of 'girls' day' where they'll have a picnic, go shopping in town and stuff like that in addition to the play. I asked my mom why the invitation now and she said that my dad (!) had suggested it. My sisters and my boyfriend get along great and he loves Shakespeare so there’s no problem, but again, the fact that my dad suggested this has me shocked. It’s so out of character for him. My boyfriend was super excited and they’ve all booked their tickets. 

3)	This past weekend we saw my parents again at my nephew’s birthday party. The kids made a huge mess. My boyfriend, mom and sister were cleaning up but my dad got mad when I (and my BIL) wanted to go help. He wanted to sit on the lawn, drink beer, and talk about baseball. I told him that if we didn’t help it wasn’t fair, and he replied that we’re allowed to do guy stuff while they clean up. I pointed out that my boyfriend was helping and he said “Yeah, but that’s different” with no more explanation. I was mad and just got up and left my dad there, and my BIL followed a few minutes later. Apparently my dad’s still pissed that I wouldn’t be a lazy asshole with him.

Anyway, what do you make of what my dad’s doing? Am I totally crazy or has he started to treat my boyfriend like he’s my girlfriend now that he’s learned, accidentally, that he’s on the bottom in bed? I’m also confused because for a while his behaviour actually seemed to improve, inviting us both out to do activities we’d enjoy. But now in light of the last incident it seems more sinister. 
What should I do? Is this all in my head or just a coincidence? Is there a way for me to tell my dad to knock it off without him being able to deny that he’s doing anything differently? Should I tell him to stop at all, given that my boyfriend would actually prefer to clean up than talk about baseball and that I do want to have some bonding time with my dad?

TL;DR: My dad accidentally found out that I'm a top and my boyfriend's a bottom in our relationship. I think it's making him treat my boyfriend like my girlfriend. Am I crazy? How can I talk to my dad about this?

"I[28m] referred my girlfriend's[25f] friend[26f] for a high paying job, my girlfriend and her friends now hate me .


I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year now. A little background about myself and my girlfriend. I make significantly more than my girlfriend and her friends. I work in consulting and have a pretty good network. I am friends with people at all different all levels throughout multiple companies, and my word carries a good bit of weight. This doesn't mean I give handouts to anyone. 

If someone I know has a good work ethic, and I know would be a good fit for a job, than I'll refer them. If you are looking to just milk a company for money, than no. 

My girlfriend works as a tutor in a learning center she doesn't make much money, in fact most of her friends don't either. In particular I met her friend Jessica a couple months ago. One thing that I will say is she is pretty, a diasdvantaged minority, and also had a really friendly/warm personality, and currently she was working at the front desk of a gym, making $10 an hour. 

Over time getting to know her I realized that she was a good person, I asked her if she was looking for a new job she said she would be interested. I had a friend who worked as a talent director, and I referred Jessica to him.  She ended up getting the interview and shortly after getting a job. His company is looking to have a more diverse candidate pool, and she was a great pick for the team. 

Things were all good, her friends said that if a new position opens up that to look out for them too, my girlfriend as well basically said the same thing.  The problem happened was when Jessica started bragging about her salary, which was now more than 2x what she used to make. She started buying fancy things.

My girlfriend has gotten extremely angry with me saying that I got her random friend a job, but won't do it for her. The reality is that my girlfriend just does not have the personality to do the job that Jessica is doing. Not that her personality is wrong or bad, in fact I prefer my girlfriend's to Jessica's just different. Her friends too now are all jealous of Jessica, and have started spreading lies that I have a huge crush on her and it is really ruining my girlfriend and I's relationship. I am not sure what to do. 

I thought I was doing a nice thing helping her friend out but instead it has really backfired. I can't give people jobs and frankly the entitlement makes it that I don't want them to ever refer them to any of my friends. What should I do?

**Tl;Dr- I referred my girlfriend's friend to a good job, now there is a lot of anger towards me after the friend started boasting about her new salary. My girlfriend and her friends want me to give them jobs.**

"Me [26 M] with my sisters[33F and 35F] went on vacation together and they are so pissed off at me that they won't speak to me.


I recently went on a beach vacation trip with my two older sisters and their families.  They both have husbands and one has 3 kids and one has 4 kids.  I am single.  The kids range in age from 3-13.

During the trip, I stayed in the condo with my sister who has 3 kids.  Each condo was a two-bedroom set-up with bunk beds in the smaller bedroom.  I happily bunked in there with my nieces and nephews.  We had a blast and I loved seeing everyone and their families since we are all spread out over the country and don't spend much time together.  

Here is the sticky part.  There was a nice girl (21F) that was flirting we me at the pool and beach while we were there.  She was vacationing with her parents.  After a while, we ended up texting with each other late one night and decided to sneak out of our respective units and spend a little time together.  I would never bring her to the room with the kids in it and she would never bring me in where her parents were at.  We were very discreet.  After the 3rd night in a row of sneaking out for a few hours, one of the kids apparently heard me leave and went and told my brother in law that I was gone.  When I returned, my sister and her husband went nuts on me.  They were waiting up in the living room for me and gave me a huge lecture when I got back.  

I could not understand what the issue was.  Here are two adults spending a bit of time together and we were being very sensitive to my nieces and nephews and her family as well.  They told me that I should save that stuff for when I get home.  

I don't get it, was I wrong?

I lived alone with my mum since she I was eight and her and my dad split up. My dad got married and has had two younger children with his wife. His wife has an older son from a past relationship who lives with her and my dad. I moved in with my dad at the start of the year because my mum lost her job and had to move out and live in her friends one bedroom apartment which doesn’t have room for me. 

Toby [pseudonym - idk if he is on reddit] does lifelike sketches of people which are pretty amazing. He gets commissions to draw people, celebrities and characters for people online for up to $150.

He is quite shy and reserved so we don’t talk much. I tend to give him a fair bit of space because we don’t have much in common and he has a weird vibe. A while ago he was showing me some of his drawings and asked if he could draw me. He just drew my head and shoulders but it was very accurate.

Yesturday I was telling my friend about Toby's drawings. She asked me snapchat her a photo of his drawing of me. Toby has a tone of sketchbooks but I remembered the one he drew me in was red so I looked through that book. The red book I looked through was almost empty and didn’t have the sketch I was looking for in it so I looked around his room and found a second red book under his bed. 

The book I found was full of sketches of just me. Some of just my face to my shoulders but some of me in just undies and there were several pages of me without any clothes on. There were also a few pictures of me in very sexual positions. All together there were at least 50 drawings of me. 

The sketches of my body were scarily accurate - down to two freckles I have on my chest and a scar I have on the top of the back of my thigh. I don’t really wear skimpy clothes and I don’t think he has every seen me not fully dressed. I don’t know how he would know about those details and I am scared he has been watching me get dressed or something. 

I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want to create any drama because things aren’t great in my family atm. I don’t think my dads wife really wanted me to move in with them which has caused some tension and I don’t want to give her a reason to dislike me. I am scared she would side with her son as I am a outsider in their house. I am not particularly close with my dad either, I feel like he is doing me a massive favour by letting me stay with them [they are struggling financially and I am an extra burden on them] so I don’t want to make it difficult for him. I also think he would side with Toby because he knows him better than he knows me and they are pretty close. 

Knowing about the pictures has put me really on edge. I haven’t had to deal with this sort of this before and I have no idea how to handle this. I was thinking of talking to him myself but I feel too embarrassed and I am scared about how he would react. I also don’t feel very safe around him right now so I think I need to do something.

I am completely freaked out and could really use any advice on how to handle this without causing any drama or giving my dad and his wife a reason to dislike me. Is this something I can let slide and if not what do I do?

"My mother [73] is planning to buy an extremely elaborate 75th birthday gift for my father, and is asking each of my siblings [39M, 32F] and I [37] to contribute to the cost, but expects me to pay the most because I earn the most money


My father is turning 75 in September. Prior to his retirement ten years ago, he was a university professor (philosophy).


My mother considers his seventy-fifth birthday a big milestone, and wants to get him a heavily-customized, Rolex ""Submariner"" watch, which is already very expensive in its basic form, but, after her customizations (different materials, engraving, etc.), the retailer quoted her a cost of twelve thousand dollars.


My parents have three children: my older brother, who is lieutenant-colonel in the army (he went to West Point), my sister, who went to college for an English degree but married a lawyer and is currently a stay at home mother, and me. I went to medical school and am an anesthesiologist.


In the past, I'd always given my parents and siblings sensible, practical gifts for their birthdays. Even though, admittedly I earn more money than either of my siblings, I do not spend a lot of money on their presents. In relative terms, I will usually spend a few hundred dollars to buy a close family member a present.



My mother phoned each of us to talk about her gift-giving plans. My parents live in Berkeley, California, my sister is in Boston, my brother is currently serving in Maryland, and I live in Chelsea, Manhattan.


She had gotten my brother and sister to each pledge two thousand dollars toward the purchase of the watch. My mother intends to pay another two thousand dollars out of her personal spending money (she never worked a job for pay but my father always shared his salary and now retirement fairly with her). So, she and my two siblings are each contributing an equal share.


That leaves a balance due of six thousand dollars, not including tax which I'm guessing will be another thousand dollars or so.


My mother point blank said that I should pay for the outstanding six thousand dollars.


I told her I didn't like the idea that I'm paying more than my siblings (and her) for a present that I had no input in selecting and which I would have never chosen.


My mom says that I am being selfish and that since I make far more money than my brother and sister, it's morally right that I pay more for my father's gift.


Personally I think my father will not like having such a ridiculously expensive watch. His taste is just different. He is more of a Dockers, cardigan, and Keds kind of person. 


But more importantly I don't like that my mother is choosing a present and attaching my name to it without asking my opinion on anything. I think the watch as she has it configured is loud, obnoxious, and tacky.


Furthermore, she acts as if it is my duty to contribute more because I'm in a financial position to do so. I can understand if it's a life or death situation where someone needs money to have a new and experimental treatment done, but this is a present.


I'm not as sure about my sister because she's always been a bit of a princess, but I'm certain my brother would never go along with my mother's idea if he knew that I was contributing more than the others. 


I told my mother I'd get back to her and then made an excuse and hung up. She's been texting me a lot telling me to send the money soon. I texted her that I think it's unfair to ask me to contribute three times as much as anyone else's contribution, and double everyone else's contribution combined.


She tells me I'm being selfish and petty and ungrateful.


I'm certainly grateful for them giving me food and shelter as a kid but my college and medical school were paid 100% by scholarship and loan, which I paid back on my own.
   

I suggested that she get a less extravagant gift more in line with my father's taste, but she insists that it's his 75th, it's special, and that I'm being a miser.


I'll probably end up just giving the money. Six thousand dollars is a lot, but it won't hurt me that much, really.


I just feel sore about it, is all.


I'm not looking for answers or counsel, just getting down on the screen and releasing some energy.

"I [26/f] found my boyfriend's [29/m] diary. I didn't read it but his reaction to me finding it makes me think I should ask more questions.


My boyfriend, Luke, and I have been together 4 years and have just moved to a new place together. We have a pretty typical relationship and I really have no complaints. He’s never blown up on me and I’ve never had a reason to suspect anything. This recent situation has started to concern me though….
 

Like I said above, we recently (last week) moved to a new place so a lot of things are in boxes and haven’t been put away. I took Wednesday, Thursday, and today off of work to hopefully finish up the remaining boxes. Yesterday, I was going through a box when I found a book that was Luke’s. I scanned the first page and realized it was a journal because it had a February 2016 date at the top. I did not read anything else.  I used to have a journal that I would write in and I know I would have been upset if someone went through it. I’ll admit I was curious but I still didn’t read anything. I took it to the bedroom and put it on his nightstand so he could store it where he wants. I didn’t think he’d have the reaction he did….

 
When he got home last night and realized the journal was on the nightstand he immediately accused me of reading it. I explained that I did not read it. He didn’t believe me. He began yelling and ranting that he doesn’t “mean any of it,” that I “shouldn’t let it affect the relationship,” he “isn’t like that anymore,” “it was a one-time thing,” and he “really does love me.” I just kind of looked at him. He waited for a response but I didn’t have anything to say. Truthfully, I wanted him to keep ranting just to get a better feel of what was in it. We stared at each other for what felt like minutes when I said “I honestly didn’t read through it but it seems like there are things in there I should know about based on your reaction.” At that point, I think he believed me just from my expression. I felt like I looked pale.
 

When he realized that I really didn’t look through it, he tried to back track and say they are just fabricated stories/creative writing that he writes sometimes. I’ve never known Luke to enjoy writing. This is something that he’s never shared with me. He’s also not a “creative” type of guy. He’s more of a “believer of facts.” His words when we first met. I told him that he seemed really emotional over it and I’d like to know more about this hobby since he’s never shared it with me. I told him he doesn’t have to show it to me just give me an example of what he writes. He refused. I dropped it but the rant still weighed on my mind all night. This morning, I noticed the journal was gone. I assumed he would have hidden it so it didn’t surprise me. I continued with unpacking boxes when I went to store some stuff in our new office when I came across the diary AGAIN. I left it in its hiding place and didn’t touch it.
 

 
So, is this something I should be concerned about? I completely understand privacy when it comes to journals/diaries but his blowup and rant really weirded me out. I’ve never seen that before. He refuses to give me any idea of what’s in the journal. I’m not a big writer but I did have a journal once. I can’t say I would ever use the phrases “don’t let it affect our relationship” and “I’m not like that anymore” if someone ever found it though.
 

TLDR: I found my boyfriends diary but didn't read it. He didn't believe me at first and went on this rant. Some of what he said concerned me and now I'm not sure what to think about this diary. "
"My [21F] brother [22M] died. His ex is telling everyone that he was a horrible person and world is a better place now that he's gone.


My brother died two weeks ago, a genetic heart problem. It was a long time coming so it wasn't a shock but it's not any less sad for us. The problem is that his ex girlfriend who is being a complete asshole right now. This is what she posted on Facebook:

""My ex died. I'm not glad he's dead but I'm glad he's gone. World is a better place without him in it.""

When I saw it it had already received a lot of negative replies from her friends telling her that she's being very rude and disrespectful. She deleted that and later sent:

""Look you misunderstood me. I didn't want him dead. I just don't want him walking among us. I guess behind bars was enough but I'm not going to pretend I'm sad he's dead because I'm not.""

It took me every ounce of my self restraint to not reply or go find her and punch her in the face but that's not the end of it. She's been posting things about him that make him look like a psychopath and I'm sure they're lies. She says he did drugs, he cheated on her, he watched dog fighting, and other things. These are all lies. They broke up because of his declining health and because she wanted sex and he couldn't do it anymore. That was 9 months ago. Not because of cheating! He wasn't even physically able to have sex with anyone at that time, let alone cheating on her.

My brother was very unlucky. He died so young and his memory is all that remains and it's so hurtful to see her doing this to his memory and I don't know what to do. My other brother and me are very upset.

What's the best way to approach and handle this problem?

"I (24F) am not sure I want to marry my fiance (28M) after he brought up open relationships


[removed]"
"My wife [32F] is absolutely DEVASTATED that our daughter [4F] says she loves her aunt [34F] more than her own mother, and I [29M] am at a loss as to what to do


My wife and I have been married for six years. We have an almost- five year old daughter. I am an only child myself, but my wife is the middle child, with an older sister and a younger brother [29].


When our child was a baby and toddler, my wife stayed home with her and we all just lived on my income as an architect. I have an office downtown, but the company I work for generally lets me work at home, and I go to the downtown office one a week, twice at the most. 


When our daughter entered kindergarten early, my wife got a job as a substitute teacher (her degree is in history), and has a deal with the district where in she is pretty much guaranteed to have an assignment only once a week, every Thursday. When she is home, she takes care of our daughter and also works on paintings, which she sells on Etsy. She uses the money she earns teaching to buy her art supplies. When my wife is with our daughter she usually takes her to the park, on walks, to the library, on playdates. Occasionally when I can spare the time during the day, I accompany them for a while.


My wife's sister, who is unmarried and lives alone in an apartment about fifteen minutes away by car, offered to come over and watch our daughter on Thursdays. While it would seem unnecessary, since I am at home all the time practically, my work is actually very involved and requires all of my concentration, and when I'm working at home, it's behind a closed home-office door.


Typically what will happen is that my wife has to leave for her own assignment much earlier than when our daughter leaves for school, so my wife's sister comes over early in the morning even though I'm around and could drop our daughter off at school if needed.


My wife's sister and I generally get daughter dressed, make breakfast, and my wife's sister then takes daughter to school. My daughter gets out of kindergarten around lunchtime, so my wife's sister always just comes back to our house to make lunch for everyone. She will then pick daughter up from school and we all eat together. She will then play with daughter and hang out with her until three or four o'clock in the afternoon, at which time my wife comes home.


This happens one time per week.


Occasionally, during the two or three hour window between lunch and my wife coming home, my sister in law will take daughter to the mall or out for ice cream.


Three nights ago my wife and I were telling our daughter to finish her vegetables at dinner, and she was being very pouty about it. My wife insisted that she finish her asparagus or else she didn't deserve dessert.


At that point our daughter said, ""I hate vegetables why do I have to eat them? I love Auntie [name] better; she isn't mean like you.""


I judged her statement to be the childish and somewhat manipulative outburst for what it was, but my wife just acted so strangely about it.


She just got up from the table, asked me to make sure our daughter finished her food, and went to our bedroom and shut the door. I didn't think too much about it at the moment, but fifteen minutes later I went to the bedroom to check on my wife and I could tell she had been crying.


I've asked her about it and she says she's okay. I told her that our kid is just being a bratty kid and that she's trying to do the kid thing and manipulate us, maybe even unknowingly so.


But I can tell my wife actually is terrified that our daughter loves her aunt more than her.  


My wife then said she doesn't want to be a substitute teacher anymore and doesn't want her sister coming over. Prior to this incident, my wife always said how much she enjoyed ""teacher Thursday"" because she loved making a difference in the classroom, loved speaking to a class, and all that.


When I mentioned in an offhand way that her sister would probably be disappointed (but that I also went along with her decision to quit teaching if that's what she really wants), my wife said something like, ""Who cares what she thinks? Why do you care?""


Then she said her sister was stealing her family, and said something that makes me upset even now:


""She's trying to steal you, too, are you blind? Do you mind if she steals you? Have you * * * *ed her? You * * * *ed her didn't you? Is she better?"" 


I tried REALLY hard not to get furious at such a suggestion but I was really hurt. I was so insulted that I haven't dignified that accusation with a response to her (FYI I DIDN'T **** my sister in law), and just think that's she's upset because our daughter said she loves her aunt more than her mom.


My wife's been really sad the last couple of days. I suggested she go see a therapist (my insurance covers it) but she insists everything is okay. I can tell she's sad.


What can I do here? What do I tell her?


Is there any explanation for her behavior?


Just have no idea where any of this is coming from.

"Today is my husbands (m/28) birthday. I'm not speaking to him due to an event at the weekend. Should I (f/28) get over it for this one day?


My husband and I have been married for two years, and for two years our marriage has been marred with his drinking. We have a great relationship except the drinking. He is incapable of going for dinner, going to a family event, or doing anything that everyone else remains relatively sober at, without getting incredibly drunk. 

He is not a big big drinker, but after a couple of drinks his eyes glaze over and he acts like a drunken idiot and there's no speaking to him. I think this is because he's a very petite man and drink goes straight to his head. Usually I'm left to hoist him home. The first year of our marriage the big thing when he gout drunk when he was out without me- such as at a bar for a friend's birthday - was to end up at the casino and he'd always always come home a few $100 down.

I managed to stop this by generally avoiding drinking situations, always trying to be with him when he was out at drinking events we couldn't say no to so I could get him home without him ending up at the casino, and finally only going out with cash when he did go out so he had a finite amount of money to spend. 

On Saturday, it was his best friends bachelor party. Of course I didn't want to tag along with him, but he assured me he was a new man and never, ever would he dream of going to the casino. Cue 2am and I get a phone call. It was my husband on the phone very drunk, telling me he had no money left because he was at the casino and spent all his money and couldn't pay for the taxi home. He self-excluded himself from the casino last year, but pretended to be his brother when he went to the reception desk. I went and got him and he passed out drunk on the porch.

I'm sick  of his drinking, and I think I've reached the point of where I can't be with him because he's promised more times than I've had hot dinners that he's going to change and only have a couple of drinks instead of getting so drunk we can't even go for dinner without him getting ridiculously drunk. That was Saturday, this is now Tuesday, his birthday. I have barley spoke to him since Tuesday. He knows I've got nothing to say to him as I sound like a broken down record player with the same argument 70% of our Sunday mornings with how drunk he got the night before. I've reached my limit. 

However, it's his birthday today. Should I get over this and, for the simple fact he's my husband, give him a good day and go back to deciding if I am completely sure I want to break up with him tomorrow? I love my husband, but I can't go on with his drinking, but I feel like utter crap I'm ignoring his birthday. What should I do reddit? 

TL;DR; Three days ago, husband and I had a huge argument about his drinking. We're still not talking but today is his birthday, what do I do?"

I've always been the black sheep. They're hyper-competitive, I'm not. They enjoy hunting, I don't. Work's their life and I've been on an extended vacation since '08. You get the idea.

So the short and tall of it is that I dropped out and entered the work force as soon as I possibly could. I saved every penny, moved out on my eighteenth and bought some land and what would nowadays be called a tiny house. 

Ever since then I've devoted most of my life to my interests, hobbies, and friends. I play music, travel, do charity work, whatever. They've always disapproved, partially due to religion and partially due to them being generally manipulative people.

For my birthday they gave me an ultimatum. Either I ""grow up"" or they'll never speak to me again. They've managed to corral a good chunk of my family against me as well. I'll admit that I don't particularly like the vast majority of them but it still hurts.

"Me(22f) with my boss (45m) and his suggestions about my appearance.


Just met my new boss for the first time last night. He's taking over this division of a company I have been working at for 2 years.

I guess he was trying to learn a bit about our team, and admitted to me after a few beers (work function) that he went on all my songwriting blogs (I'm a software engineer, so not really relevant - a little creepy but okay, whatever). If anything I'm a little weirded out because those blogs don't use my real name.

I must have turned red as he said this - some personal things on there I don't want to imagine him reading, my battle with depression, etc... - and he responds telling me to be more confident. I am confident, just quiet. I am one of two girls at my start up and the only software engineer. I dress plainly because I like to and do not think it is the business of anyone else. My other female coworker (Lauren) is a beautiful blond about 10 years older than me. She dresses very provocatively and rocks it. She looks like a million dollars every day, and I love her. I'm more of a jeans and t shirt person. More of a nerd? Whatever, can't make myself want to get up early to look good, that's just me. 

So, boss tells me he likes my songs to which I (still horrified that he went on my blog) and to be more confident. I argue that I am, to which he drops the kicker: ""no, you're not. If you were, you'd dress like Lauren."" 

He said this as a suggestion to me, but also in front of Lauren in a critical of her way. 

At this point I'm laughing (I laugh when I am nervous). So confused at who this man is. He tells me I'd be really pretty if I wanted to be, and comments on my dark under eye circles: is that make up? Are you run down?

No, I said, i don't wear makeup, I just look like this. 


I have never compared the way two men at work dress, or what they could do to be more attractive. I flipping hate when anyone thinks that they are the ones who have a say in if you should be dolled up.

If Lauren wants to wear short dresses and low cut tops, that is her choice and she looks damn good. If I want to dress plainly, why does it concern him? Why can't I not show skin and still be happy with myself?

Help me, Reddit! I love my job, but these kind of comments will drive me insane and I'd like to nip this behavior in the bud.

TLDR: new boss kinda pervy, finds need to make suggestions about my appearance and my female coworkers'."

"[Update] My [21M] GF [20 F] of 6 months suddenly wants me to give up watching anime.


Just thought I'd give a quick update on [my thread from 2 weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4s9ub8/my_21m_gf_20_f_of_6_months_suddenly_wants_me_to/)

I talked to her and asked her why she wants me to quit watching anime because she's known I watch it from day 1 of our relationship. As it turns out her parents were very disapproving of anime (her dad is basically a real life version of the asian dad meme) and they were bad mouthing me when they she told them about me and my hobbies. So it turns out that she herself didn't have any problems with me watching anime she just wanted to live up to her parents expectations.

I told her that while I understand where she's coming from she also has to understand that anime is a long time hobby of mine, that it will never get in the way of our relationship, I still get all my responsibilities done and that I will take whatever flak her parents give me when and if I end up meeting them. 

I also brought up the possibility of us watching it together. So at the recommendation of another subreddit we started watching Nana together. I'm not really expecting her to suddenly fall in love with anime because of this but it is a nice way to spend time with two things I really love. 
   
**tl;dr**: Gf didn't really hate anime just trying to meet the expectations of her strict parents. Told her it won't effect our relationship and not to worry about it. Now watching Nana together."
"My [42F] neighbors [40s M/F] are demanding everyone follow their customs and are now harassing my kids.


EDIT: Thank you for all the replies. I just want to point out because it's been hammered in the replies and I addressed it in numerous comments, but I think it's been missed. I reported the dog to animal control and it seems to have been properly addressed.  I was unaware that I could report them on the homeschooling front (or lack thereof) and it appears there is a lot of conflicting opinions/advice on that matter. My stance on it is that I don't agree with what they are doing at all, I think it's harmful for the kids, but it's their legal right to do it. It's generally not my policy to call the cops/authorities/etc. right away but try and deal directly with things.  I went to them about the dog first when I had a problem with it, when they did nothing about it I then called animal control.  When they were leaving their kids in a running car (A/C on because it was hot) so Nora could finish getting ready, I went to Mike and Nora and asked them not to because the diesel fumes and noise is  annoying, it's not safe for the kids and it's against the law. They stopped for awhile, and then started doing it again, so I called the cops. I'm generally a live and let live kinda person until the shit in the neighbor's yard is spilling over into mine. And YES! I get it the name issue is petty and stupid. I totally admit that. I was just curious about other people's take on the issue.  It seems to be a pretty mixed bag.

I'm going to admit upfront that this is a rather silly relationship question, but nevertheless, it is causing a bit of strain between my family and my neighbors. 

About a year ago, a family with five kids moved next door to us.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a great thing, we have three kids of similar age, but it quickly turned into a total pain in the ass because our families mix like oil and water.  They are super religious right wing, holier-than-thou know-it-all's who constantly tell us we are wrong, way over step our boundaries and are driving us crazy. A couple examples of their many transgressions:

- Leave their dog outside unattended in any and all weather for upwards of 12 hours at a time to bark non-stop when they go on frequent day trips. They also told me that ""he's good with kids"" because when he was a puppy they used to ""beat the crap out of him"" and now he lets the kids do anything and he ""wouldn't dare snarl, let alone bite."" 

- They homeschool their kids, but neither of them graduated college, she actually dropped out of high school and later got a GED, and honestly it seems like little to no schooling actually takes place.  The older girls babysit the younger boys while the mom does nails out of the home and goes shopping.  The 13 year old didn't know who nazis were and actually said ""there was a world WAR?"" when I tried to explain.

- They ""borrowed"" money, food, tools, toys, clothes, etc. without returning or replacing or returning them damaged non stop until I put my foot down and began categorically refusing all requests.

I could go on and on, but I'll spare you more because it'll just wind me up too much and go on too long. And I need to get to the problem. So, here it is. 

When I first met them, I asked them, as I ask all adults when introducing my kids, how they would like my kids to address them.  They said, Miss Nora and Mr. Mike. [All names herein changed.] Fine.  Done.  But then their kids started calling my husband and I, Miss Jen and Mr. Adam, without asking me how I prefer to be addressed.  I HATE this form of address.  I'm not Southern (neither are they,) we're not in the South, I'm not a Sunday school teacher, it bugs me.  I let them know, and said, ""hey, I prefer you just call me Jen."" But Nora and Mike told me no, they were teaching their kids the right way and to be polite and that all adults are to be addressed as Miss or Mr First Name.  I was pretty sick of their our way is the only way BS by that time and I told them that actually, the most formal way is for children to refer to adults as Mr or Mrs Last Name, so their kids can either call me Jen or Mrs. (4 syllable Greek last name) but NOT Miss Jen because I hate it.  My husband didn't really give a rats ass either way, but he thinks it's funny when I go on a tirade and he hates the neighbor's too, so he jumped in and told them he shouldn't be referred to as Mr because he's a doctor and now only wants to be referred to as Dr. (4 syllable Greek last name.) It hasn't gone over well and has created this weirdly aggressive war. I've tried to explain that they can't dictate how my kids address them AND how their kids address my husband and I, but they have gone so far now as to correct my kids when they address other neighbor's and friends if they don't follow the custom they prefer, eventhough we have established with these people how they prefer to be addressed. And now their kids are coming to me and tattling on my kids for every tiny transgression.  I got fed up and told one, ""tattling is really annoying and no one likes it when people tattle, please stop,"" and then shut the door hard in her face. But now the kids are being mean to my kids, and saying shit about how we are going to hell because we don't believe in God and it's scaring my 7 year old. 

How do I get my neighbor's to cool it? And am I seriously out of line to ask adults how they want my kids to be address them, and also expecting the same in return? I'm even willing to compromise and go by Mrs. K, because I realize my last name is a beast and some people are never going to be comfortable with their kids calling me Jen.  But Miss Jen makes my skin crawl.

   
**tl;dr**: My neighbor's are awful for many reasons, but I'm especially irritated that they make their kids call me Miss Jen when I prefer Jen or Mrs. K. Who's wrong? "

I am a firefighter and have been for three years. I typically work about seventy-two hours a week. Sometimes eight hours at a time, sometimes twelve hours, but by and large my most typical shift is three days, twenty four hours each. Unless I switch with someone or am covering someone else, I'll most often work all three days in a row, then have four days in a row off.


I've been married to ""Antoinette"" for two years, and we have a ten month old son ""Marcel.""


Antoinette's widowed mother lives with us to help us take care of the baby. 


When I come home from my three days on duty, I am utterly exhausted and my first day off is almost always me just crashing the entire time passed out in bed.


Antoinette thinks that the minute I set foot inside the house, it's ""my turn"" to take care of the baby and she should be able to leave the house and hang out with her friends, go shopping for herself, or get ""pampered"" with hair and nails and facials.


I do not disagree in the least that she has a hard job at home taking care of a less than one year old baby, but I think the way she wants to take off the minute I come home is unreasonable. I try to tell her how exhausting my job is but she has it in her head that I spend all my time at the fire station hanging out on the internet or gossiping with my buddies. She doesn't seem to understand that our station commander makes sure there is very, very little idle time, and we spend the rest of the time doing drills, training, exercising, getting reviewed, and the like. That is when there isn't something going on that requires us to respond to emergency calls, which happens so constantly that we are always on edge.


It is a high stress job and I think I should have a day to myself when I come home to unwind and deflate because I'm so keyed up I feel like I'll go crazy if I don't relax for at least a little at home.


Antoinette thinks that I should ""take over"" as parent for Marcel the moment I come home. 


I don't mind helping to take care of him when I'm home but I think I deserve some time to myself before I ""take over."" And why should I ""take over"" anyway. I think that when we're home we should take care of the kid together.


But when I'm home during my days off, whenever the baby cries, it's up to me to change him, see to what he needs.


My wife won't lift a finger for the baby if I'm home during my days off. She says she ""did her part"" while I was off at the station.


She seems to think that being a firefighter is some kind of social club where all I do is have fun. I enjoy my work, but it is by no means some kind of ha-ha, joy-joy theme park where a bunch of stupid jocks play frathouse.


Antoinette's mother only speaks French and I only speak a little bit, but in conversations with her mother it seems Antoinette often leaves a lot of the child-rearing to my mother in law.


I think Antoinette is being unfair and that we should share parenting duties 50/50 when I am home, but also that she should give me at least SOME time to relax before I start being Super Dad. 


She seems to think that she's done her part while I'm gone at work, and that once I'm home she's off the clock so to speak.


Our sexual life is fine and we do socialize together and with other people, so in those regards our marital relations seem healthy enough.


It's just her philosophy toward parenting and the division of labor where we disagree. I think she underestimates how hard my job is and how much it takes to recover.


I appreciate that having a young child at home is a hard job too and it takes time to recover, but part of the reason I'm supporting Antoinette's mother is so that the older woman can give us a hand at home, which she does, and does faithfully and with zero complaint. When Antoinette is home ""at work"" taking care of our son, it's not as if I am sleeping and relaxing at MY job. I'm working too.


Any advice on what I can say to Antoinette without insulting her contribution? Or, any insight on how I might be looking at this the wrong way?


Thank you in advance, Reddit.

"I [16M] was ditched on prom night. It's been almost 2 months and people still won't drop it and keep bringing it up


So forgive me for I have not used Reddit before, I have been up a majority of the night trying to figure out what to do. I would normally go to one of my sisters about this but they are on vacation with my mom in Europe. I am home alone in the states currently for the next 2 weeks until they return.

Before school ended for the Summer we had Junior Prom. Now I was going with my friend who I will refer to as Jess. Jess and I have been friends for a long time, since middle school to be accurate. Jess asked me if I would go to Prom with her since and she just wanted to have a relaxed evening. There were other girls I could have taken but I turned them down because I was going with Jess. 

So come the day I was all dressed up and we were meeting at this local park. This park has a lake? It's more a body of water than a lake. I don't think it's big enough to be a lake, anyway you get the idea. We were to get our pictures taken there and leave together. As I arrived I was just getting out of my car and I was met face to face with Jess 

She asked if she could speak to me. In a nut shell because I feel this is getting pretty lengthy. She told me that she is really sorry, but her crush who we will call Joe had no one to go to the Prom with. She told me this is the perfect opportunity for them to connect and start a relationship. She pretty much told me she won't be going with me and will be going with Joe. 

She told me that she would like it if I could make my own way to the prom to make things less awkward. At this point I was so pissed off I just got in my car and went home. Made myself some popcorn, ordered some pizza and watched Netflix. What a fucking prom night that was hey?

As if I was going to go and embarrass the fuck out of myself and stand there fucking dateless, while literally everyone else I know fucked around and had a nice fucking time in their happy fucking happy fairy tale ending. 

Only problem is people will not drop it, I keep getting tagged in promo photos, I keep getting asked about it, I keep getting basically harassed about it. I have told people multiple times to fuck off about it and they don't listen. 

What do I do, I have to go to school with these people 



tl;dr: People keep bring up the fact I was ditched on prom night

"My (28F) Colleague (18F) won't leave me alone and it's become too much.


Sorry in advance this got a little longer than I thought it was going to be.


A couple of years ago one of my best friends (35F, we’ll call her Gemma) opened up a bakery. It took off pretty quickly and I (28F) started working for her part time (I was a SAHM beforehand). Soon after she needed to take on more staff and hired Heather (18F). I found out I was pregnant around this time and the plan was Heather would eventually take over my shifts. 


Heather seems nice enough, but young and a little annoying (though I was more sensitive to that since I was already pregnant and irritable). We got along fine in work but we weren’t about to be best friends outside of work or anything. She hadn’t known anyone pregnant before and was very forward in asking personal questions and being quite handsy with my bump. I should have been more clear I wasn’t comfortable with this from the start but I realised this was new to her and no hard meant by it so I let it slide. 


I also find out that her mum has been unwell and suffering from mental health problems. She had been sectioned just before she started working for my friend and had on going issues. Obviously this had been and was still very hard on Heather and her family, and having suffered with mental health problems myself, albeit much less severe, I know how difficult it can be. Again I cut her more slack than maybe I should have because of this. 


As my pregnancy goes on, she starts saying how excited she is for the baby, and buying little gifts like the odd sleepsuit. I told her that it’s very sweet, but she really didn't need to buy us anything (second child, we have plenty) but she doesn't stop. Bit by bit I find her behaviour a little odd, she keeps buying us more things, buying things for my toddler, texting me increasingly often and trying to invite herself round to my house. I figure she just wants to be friends but just going about it a little oddly. I gently make it clear I am tired, have a 2yo and I'm not about to invite her back for dinner after work. I also decide at this point to outright tell her to stop buying things.


A few weeks later is my son's 3rd birthday and I was talking to Gemma in work that we we're going to get him a bike for his birthday and he's really excited. That evening I get a text from Heather saying she wants to get him a scooter for his birthday and sends me a link to one. I text back saying ""please don't buy him a scooter, his main present is going to be a bike and you don't need to buy him anything at all"" I get no reply, which is odd considering how text happy she is, but think no more about it. Then 2 days later she turns up at my house with the scooter with a balloon tied to it and hands it straight to my son. I can't exactly take it back off him and I was really angry she had ignored me. I told her not to do anything like that again and offered to pay for the scooter as I'm not comfortable with her spending so much money on my kids. 


A few weeks later I finish work before the baby comes and figured I won’t have to deal with her as much and things will fizzle out. However as soon as I finish I'm being bombarded with texts (around 10 a day) to which I'm replying to, at most, 1 or 2 if at all. She's asking to come round constantly and I keep making excuses why not. Eventually I give in to keep the peace and because I've run out of excuses and she turns up at my house with her new puppy?! She said she thought it would be nice for my son to play with him. I'm days off having a baby in the baking hot sun with a bloody puppy running around, eating my furniture and pissing in my house. I said soon after she arrived that I was going out so she couldn't stay long and she said that her dad had dropped her while he nipped to an appointment and would be back to pick her up in 20mins. He finally came back 3 hours later. 3 hours. She has her own car so I swear she'd planned it this way knowing all along she'd be here for hours.


I was so cross after this I just stopped replying to her and a week later my baby was born so I forgot all about it. I let Gemma know straight away with her being my best friend but I didn't bother telling Heather. Gemma let her know at work a couple of days later and said that my husband and I will want some space for a couple of weeks. Heather said ""it thought she'd had the baby, I drove past the other day and saw her husband's car was there"". I live in a cul-de-sac! She said the first time she came to my house she had never been to our estate before so it’s not like she'd have been driving by for any reasons other than to come to my house. It didn’t feel right.


Then despite Gemma saying to give us space, she ups her daily texts to 15-20 a day. I didn’t even reply for the first week but they didn’t slow. I sent her the odd short, polite reply in the next few weeks but they still kept up at the same amount. She has also started buying personalised gifts (blankets, clothes etc.) for both my kids so she can’t return them and I can’t really donate them either. She’s turned up uninvited, she’s left stuff on my doorstep. It’s just way too much.


There’s more examples but this has already gotten too long


I’ve found out her mum has been sectioned again so this may be why she’s reacting this way, and obviously I empathise with that, but it’s not on that its impacting my life so much. I don’t feel like I can go into work to visit my friends/colleagues with my baby because she’ll be there. 


I really don’t know what to do here because I don’t want to upset her in what is obviously a difficult time and I also definitely don’t want this to impact Gemma’s business, she does have to keep on working with her everyday after all. 

 
**tl;dr**: Colleague won’t leave me alone, is trying to buy mine/my children’s friendship and it’s become way over the top and invasive.

"My [33M] brother in law [36M] manipulated the sickly priest at my wedding.


Got married yesterday, beautiful ceremony, wonderful reception everyone had a good time. Two weeks before my wedding, the priest emailed my wife [31f]explaining that he is not feeling well (recovering from c-diff and a hernia operation) would like to enlist the help of another priest to help with the ceremony because he cannot stand on his feet for very long. We of course had no problem with this. During the ceremony, the other priest was not present, which was strange to my wife and I, however, the process went off without a hitch. 

During the cocktail hour the priest approached my wife and apologized for ""disrespecting her"" and explaining ""that if he knew that enlisting the help of another priest was distasteful he would have never asked"". My wife was obviously confused by this and became rather upset. Turns out, my brother in law, an MD who is heavily involved in the church where we were married told the priest that  two priests were distasteful and that my wife did not want them. This of course was a lie. 

The rest of the night went great but in the morning I approached him about his behavior. I told him calmly that I did not appreciate him circumventing us, and explained that he owes my wife an apology. He did not speak with her at all. Later in the same day, I texted him ""you owe your sister an apology"".

An hour after the text was sent, my wife's mother [69f] called her screaming, that I shouldn't get involved and that she has no problem with her sons behavior. She also explained that she did not want the second priest because she did not want to pay him another $250. (We did not, the original priest said the second one would not charge us)
My wife called her brother, furious, and demanded an apology, he did, but then proceeded to say that we ""did not take the church service seriously because we were laughing and smiling during parts of it""

That's pretty much where the story ends, and I cannot help but think that my brother in law is an amazing hypocrite. Not only did he manipulate a sick mans behavior for virtually no reason, he also lied by omission to my wife and I and disrespected the same church that he chastised me for ""not taking seriously"".  This man is a Medical Doctor, who is supposed to save people's lives, why didn't he have more empathy for the sick priest? I cannot think that he's a terrible person, I don't want to interact with people like that, but I'm stuck with this person for the rest of my life. Where should I go from here? 

TL/DR my brother in law lied and told a sick priest that he had to do the work of two people. 



Edit: additional information, BIL had 3 priests at his own wedding, including his FIL who is a church official in a congregation 4 hours away. Possible motivation here, he could have been trying to have his FIL help out with the service for some reason."
