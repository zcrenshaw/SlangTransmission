"My (48F) friend's (41F) daughter (20F) house/dog sat for us this past weekend. She went through our things and locked me out of my computer. I'm furious.


This is the second time she stayed at our house for us. The first time was during the summer. She stayed three days, two nights. 
While we were gone, I'd get random texts asking about something in my house, or commenting on something in my house. I figured she was exploring, but I thought it was harmless. 

This time, Her parents and my husband and I all went out for the night, and stayed the night (planned) so we didn't drive drunk. 

We got home Sunday, they gathered their things and left. All was good, until I saw that their daughter made soup and it exploded in the microwave and she didn't make an attempt to clean it up. Soup was all over the counter, in the sink and in two huge bowls. The bowls were filled with water and left in the sink. Fine, it's a small price to pay so my dog was taken care of. 

This evening I went to log onto my computer and I'm locked out. This isn't your ordinary lock out. I use that computer for work. As in classified information, high security locked out. I can't get back in until tomorrow. 

I tried to use my husband's computer, but it wouldn't print. I have no idea why. He said he doubted she was on his. But since he said he hasn't used it in months, and there were finger swipes in the dust, I knew she used it. Or tried. But she got no where with it. She turned it on, and off. I know this because there were no updates needed when it shut down. It would have had dozens of updates on shut down if it hadn't been turned on in months. 

I've already decided she won't stay here alone again. Hubs said to just lock everything up tight. I say no, because I won't enjoy myself being gone if I'm worried someone is filtering through my personal items, locking me out of my computer. 

I know he's not going to want me to tell my friend what her daughter did. 

What are your thoughts, kind internet strangers? I need an outside opinion. 

Tldr: Friends daughter snooped around my house, and locked me out of my computer. "
"UPDATE: Me (F27) with my fiancé (M31) (7years). We are getting married this fall, and the closer it gets, the more I am considering cancelling the wedding.


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jn78l/me_f27_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_m31_7_years_we_are_getting/

To recap my previous post, I was considering cancelling my wedding because of my dislike of attention, and my insecurities about my personal appearance. I loved the crafty aspect of wedding planning, and the idea of celebrating with family and friends, but my self esteem is very, very bad and I was convinced that I would look terrible and embarrass myself and my fiancé with my appearance.

Firstly, I'd like to report that I'm no longer engaged...because I went through with the wedding and got married this past weekend! It was easily the happiest day of my life and I have no regrets about having the wedding. My husband (!) was really supportive through the planning process and was very reassuring and helped me calm down when needed. 

I did hit a few snags (I DIY'd everything from the table runners, to the centrepieces to the flowers and although I pulled it off, omg was it ever stressful), but once the day got underway, I relaxed and had an amazing time.

This may go kind of against the typical r/relationships advice, but the best thing that I did was to just suck it up, and make myself do it. Basically I used the 'fake it till you make it' approach. I got an amazing dress, and got ready and had my hair and makeup done with my bridesmaids the day of. I was nervous but having them there with me (and a few glasses of champagne) really helped calm my nerves.

Once I started down the aisle and saw my husband, nothing else mattered. He thought I looked amazing and I felt amazing and it was a perfect day with our family and friends. Did I look perfect? No. Did it matter? No. I had a blast, and if I hadn't gone through with the wedding, I would have always regretted it. I know that weddings aren't for everyone, and that's ok, but I knew deep down that it was what I wanted. I'm so, so happy that I didn't let my insecurities prevent me from having an amazing day and marrying the love of my life with those I love present.

TL;DR: I swallowed my insecurities, went through with the wedding, had the best day of my life, and married my best friend :)

"Me [24m] with my entire family, who now hate my guts for being a whistleblower


I hope you'll bear with me here, because I have a lot of family members. I come from a religious community that doesn't believe in the public school system and tends to have a ton of kids. 

I have an older sister ""Julia"" 27f, a step brother ""Ron"" 22m, a step sister ""Molly"" 17f, a half-brother ""Joe"" 13m, and a half-sister ""Lucy"" 11f. 

Growing up, all of us were “homeschooled.” This involved a lot of neglect, lack of textbooks or seasonally appropriate clothes/shoes, unheated house, and sometimes physical abuse. I lived mostly with my mom, but spent weekends with my step family. Both houses were dysfunctional. My step mom used to have a severe problem with alcoholism, although she’s been better in the last few years.

Ron is my best friend and I would be lost without him. We’ve supported each other through years of hard times, and we discuss a lot how our lives could have been different if we’d been sent to school or generally had a more healthy home life. Obviously, we don’t want the same thing for our younger siblings, and don’t want to see them struggling in minimum wage jobs while trying to study for a GED the way we’re doing.

When I went to visit him recently I found that my step mom had gone out of the country for an ENTIRE WEEK and left the youngest two at the house. Ron and Molly both work (Molly hasn’t been doing any “homeschooling” for about 2 years) and are out of the house for most of the day and night. 

I tried to help Lucy with her math homework, but she was extremely behind grade level and kept getting distracted because she had to make lunch or do chores. Joe spends all day in his room playing video games and gets no guidance from anyone. I tried to (as gently as possible) get him to do some reading, but he doesn’t understand how serious the situation is, and obviously is having too much fun to care. 

So I called CPS and reported educational neglect.

And obviously everyone knew it was me.

And Ron told me that Stepmom said I wasn’t welcome at the house anymore and to never contact any of them again.

Molly is extremely mad at me. She blocked me on Facebook and doesn’t have a cellphone where I can reach her.
Julia, who somehow heard about all this despite living across the country, also blocked me on Facebook, and reported my Facebook as impersonating a celebrity, (Facebook deleted it, generally making everything harder).

This stings even more because I’m already estranged from my biomom over my religious beliefs. I now have no family members left (besides Ron, thank bejeebus) who want anything to do with me. I feel like I make enemies everywhere I go.

Did I do the right thing? Ron has been saying for years that he ""can't"" call CPS, and I guess this is why, but at least he doesn't blame me. He suggested that I try to talk to Stepmom once some time has passed, but I would have no idea where to begin.

  **tl;dr**: I called CPS because my youngest two siblings are being educationally neglected. My whole family is now shunning me and I don't know if it's appropriate, reasonable, or even possible to try to reconcile with them either now or when we've all cooled off."

"UPDATE - Me (24F) with my housemate (22F) and her boyfriend (24M), I caught him hitting her last year, she wont stop bringing him into the house even though I've asked her not to


Original - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/525kd1/me_24f_with_my_housemate_22f_and_her_boyfriend/ 

Hi guys! Before I update I just wanted to say a huge thanks to everyone who commented, all the opinions did help and you're all a great bunch of lads altogether. In particular I wanted to thank /u/myassholealt - I know I didn't reply on the original (I had 4,000 assignments due) but your comment really made me think about what we were doing to isolate Ashley so thank you for making me come to my senses! 

Now. I spent a day or two after posting talking with Maria and Peter, showing them this post and the comments and we all kind of came to the conclusion that the way we were acting (justified or not) really wasn't helping anybody. We were getting angry, Ashley was getting upset and Charlie was getting off on us being uncomfortable. We decided that the best course of action was for me to have one more heart to heart with Ashley, and then put it to rest and just ignore Charlie as much as possible, and be civil if we absolutely had to talk to him.

The heart to heart didn't go too well. I sat her down and just told her that we all loved her, we wanted her to be happy and safe over everything else, and we'd prefer if Charlie wasn't around as much because we truly could not forgive him for hurting her the way he did, but I also said I understood that we can't force her to break up with him and that she has every right to have him here. I asked her to think it over and just consider how she'd feel if this had been me in her situation and her in mine, and that we weren't trying to break them up out of spite, just that we were genuinely afraid that she'd get hurt again. I cried the whole way through this convo haha but she was just made of stone, said thanks, and told me to leave her be, so I did. 

After that we just acted as we normally would every time we saw Charlie! He still came to the house every fucking day, but we'd ask her every day how her day went, have a laugh and just talked a load of shite basically. This is the way we'd normally interact, and after a week or two she started warming up to us and cracking a few jokes again, it was fabulous to see. We'd answer him if he specifically spoke to one of us but apart from that didn't really pay him any mind at all. He stopped doing the weird smug smile because we started doing it back to him, so he just looked pissed off all the time instead. He'd stay at the house most nights and I took the advice from another poster and locked my door every night, just in case. 

Last Tuesday, it all came to a head. Myself, Peter and Maria went to the cinema, we invited Ashley but she declined as she had plans with Charlie. When we came home the door was wide open, all the lights were on and there was a hole in the sitting room wall. We found Ashley upstairs bawling. When we were out Charlie had confronted her about us - saying we were trying to make them break up and that we were trying to poison her against him. She defended us saying that we hadn't said a word against him and that we were being really nice to them again. He flipped out basically, screamed at her, threatened to hit her again, punched a hole in the wall, called her a few choice names and left. She went upstairs and locked herself in her room because she was terrified he'd come back. He sent her a tonne of disgusting messages and left a few voicemails. She agreed to blocking his number and deleted him off facebook. 

Unfortunately he had a copy of the house key so we had an awkward day explaining to our landlord why we needed the locks changed, but he didn't mind too much as long as we paid for it and didn't give any more copies of the key to anybody.
 
It's only been a week since all of this went down so I'm not 100% about the outcome long term, she says she's done with him but she said the same thing last time so we're just gonna keep an eye on it. He hasn't come back to the house yet but we're all a bit worried that at some point he will, so we're keeping all the windows locked and we don't want Ashley on her own in the house as much as possible for the time being. She's agreed to go to counselling and she's going away with her mother to London for the long weekend on Friday for a break.

Thanks to all of you again for your advice! Sometimes doing nothing is actually the best thing to do haha. 

TL;DR: Ignored the problem, problem threatened housemate and damaged the property, problem went away (hopefully for good) "

"I [22M] was stabbed during a robbery while out with my mother [45F]. I nearly died and my mother is now blaming herself for the attack and she has been avoiding me. I really need her right now and I don't know how to reach out to her.


Some quick backstory. I am the second oldest child of five in total [25F,me,18F,14M,12M]. I live in a town not very far away from our place but I rarely come to visit my family since I work and study there. My oldest sister is married and lives abroad with her husband while my other siblings are still living with mom.

My dad died a few years back which was really hard for us. We are a close family and death has always been hard to deal with. It could be a 5th cousin whom my mom never met but once she learned of his death, she would be really sad, even though she never met him. So you can guess what my experience put my mom through.

A couple of weeks ago I came home after being away for 6 months. Mom who was alone since my sister and two brothers were staying with our aunt (mom's younger sister) in another town. She was really excited to see me and after a bit of talking, I offered to take her out for dinner so we can catch up. 
She agreed, we got dressed and we went out.

We got into my car and drove to a local restaurant. Mom wanted me to park my car a bit away from where the restaurant was since she wanted to have a nice little walk. I agreed and we slowly made our way to the restaurant.

We had a great dinner and we quickly burned through various topics. I've always enjoyed talking to my mother about anything since she is very well educated and she is really intelligent. Plus she is really funny and I have always liked her company. We finish our dinner and again, slowly make our way back to my car. We parked not really far away (maybe 10 minutes away) and half way through, my mom realized that she has forgotten her purse in the restaurant.

I told her to go get it while I will wait for her in the car. She said she won't be long and ran back to the restaurant. I decided to skip ahead and walk through an alley that would lead me directly to my car. But it wasn't very well lit and my city does have a problem with crime and thefts and I didn't think about the dangers that may lie there.

So I started making my way across this poorly lit alley and suddenly a guy in a hoodie approaches me. He brandishes a knife and demands my wallet. I reach out for it but I didn't have any money in it. I went to show him that I don't have cash and I guess he was kinda nervous and not in a sober condition and before I could open my wallet, he stabs me a few times in the gut and runs away with my wallet, leaving the knife in me.

I fell to my knees in pain and I, again, try to do the one thing I should not, I tried removing the knife but the pain was unbearable. I felt like every organ in my body was being torn open so I fall on my back and loose conscience. I remember that I was bleeding heavily and that's about it. I can make out the guys face and some moments of the attack, but everything after that is a blur.

I woke up a few days later in the hospital surrounded by my siblings, even my oldest sister was here with her husband. They seemed really relieved to see me and my youngest brother was holding onto my hand, pretty tightly. My doctor later explained that I should consider myself extremely lucky since I have lost a great amount of blood and the attacker managed to pierce my liver which made my situation even more critical.

But the doctors did their best to save me and I thanked them for practically saving my life. I was released from the hospital not late after that and I am currently at home, still recovering. My siblings are around me helping me out and so does my mom but I could  feel that something was up with her. Like she was really ashamed to look me in the eyes or just talking to me. She avoids spending time with me, she doesn't want to be around me and I overheard her blaming herself for my situation.

I talked with my sister and she told me that mom indeed thinks this is all her fault. Mom does blame herself for this and maybe if she wasn't so stupid to leave her purse, I wouldn't have nearly died (her own words). She keeps telling herself that she is a bad mother and how she will never forgive herself for this.

I really want to let my mother know that I don't blame her at all. She says that she should have stayed with me and made sure I was safe but in all honesty, if she was with me chances are the guy would have stabbed her as well. We could have both died. I am really sad to hear that she is burdening herself with this, that she is blaming herself for something she couldn't have prevented. Hell, if there is anyone to blame in this, it's me and not her. I decided to walk through a poorly lit alley when I knew that there might be something dangerous lurking there.

So the point I am trying to make is how can I let my mom know that I don't blame her ? How can you reach to someone who doesn't want to be around you ? She refuses to talk to me or even see me. It's driving me crazy. I need my mother now more than anyone else. I nearly fucking died and it's not an easy thing to come to terms with. I am grateful to have the support of my siblings and extended family but what I really need is for my mom to be here with me and help me through this. Instead, she leaves the room every time I walk in or doesn't say a damn thing to me. What can I do reddit ?

*tl;dr I was stabbed during a botched robbery while out with my mom a few weeks ago. We were out having a dinner and she forgot her purse in the restaurant. She went back to grab it and that's when the attack happened. She now blames herself and is refusing to talk or be near me and I am really bummed out by this. I need my mother more than anyone else right now and I can't bear the thought of her burdening herself with this.*"

"I [21F] will soon be requesting my childhood CPS records from my home state, I want closure from my Mom [41F] and Grandma [60F], as they both deny any abuse ever occurred


From the time I was five years old to about twelve years old, I lived in an emotionally and physically abusive household. My Mom worked all the time and left me home with her husband, who would beat me and scream at me and throw me down stairs almost every day when I came home from school. 

CPS had successfully gotten involved after the first incident, but after seeing what happened to my mom (mentally and physically) when the state put a restraining order on my abuser, I (a kindergartner at the time) felt responsible and decided that I would lie whenever a CPS worker visited my house to check on me. I was afraid of what would happen to my mom, and I was afraid to go into foster care after all of the horrible things she had told me about it.

Over the course of the next five years, I would be visited by multiple social workers, begin counselling for depression at school, and be subjected to social isolation when not in school- although the bullying at school by teachers and other students was also pretty bad.

Mom and my abuser ended up divorcing when I was twelvish and I recall talking to my mom in the car some months later after their separation and saying, ""gee whiz mom I'm so happy I don't get have to worry about getting beat every time I come home from school.” To which my mom replied, ""what are you talking about that never happened."" From then on my depression came on full throttle and I think I tried to self medicate as best I could with drugs and alcohol. This led me into loads of other dangerous encounters with sexual violence, but I won't go into that here.

Anyways, I think that I still struggle with depression and anxiety because I've never actually received acknowledgement from anyone in my family that I was ever abused. Whenever the topic is brought up, I'm told a different story about how my memory of events is incorrect and I probably misremember because I was so young.
  ---   
  TL;DR I will soon be requesting my childhood records from child protective services. My intention is to sit down with members of my family and go through them so that I can hopefully receive the closure I need to move on and stop letting it affect me.

"My coworker (50s F) accidentally just sent me everyone at my company's salaries. I (26 F) am extremely underpaid.


Hi Reddit,


Looking for some advice on this. I work at a very small company and I have been here the last 4 years. It was my first job out of college, so when I accepted the position I accepted it at a pretty low rate. Since then, I've gotten incremental increases every year of $5000. My job requires a lot of specialized knowledge that I didn't have when I started, but now I feel pretty knowledagble and I feel as though I am an asset to my company.


Anyway, I sort of had an idea that I was being underpaid and that I should renegotiate with my boss on salary since I am no longer an inexperienced employee. However, I had no idea how far off I was. 


Today, the accountant at my company accidentally sent me a list of everyone's salaries at my company. It was supposed to go to her boss. Huuuuge fuck up, as you may imagine.  Anyway, I initially thought the email was to me so I opened it and saw it. No one else was copied on the email. I responded to her and let her know that I thought she had sent this to the wrong person. She emailed me back and said to delete it (which I've done...) but it was already too late.


What I saw made me cringe.  4 people have the same position as I do and make $30k - $50k more than I do. 3 of those started before me (2-3 years) and 1 started 2 years after me. I also think it's important to note that they are all much older than me. They are all in their 40s - 50s. So even though they haven't been at this company that much longer than me (or not as long in the one case), they have had longer work experience total... which I get. BUT... our work is exactly the same so I feel like the discrepancy shouldn't be THAT significant.  


Anyway... I'm pretty sure no one except the accountant knows that I saw this. I doubt she would tell her boss because she could be in big trouble for it. So....  is it normal to have this big of salary discrepancy with people that are older than me? Do I tell my boss I saw this? I'm thinking definitely not but just that I should ask my boss for a raise and bring him ""research"" online that I did for people with my position in our area. I've googled it before and the salary online shows it should be in line with what the others are being paid.


HELP! 

TL;DR: I accidentally just found out that everyone with my position at my company gets paid way better than I do. What do I do?

"My [23F] boyfriend [25M] was tagged in a pic on instagram with another girl and now won't show me his phone?


My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and everything has been pretty good up until this point. 

I was looking at his instagram tagged pictures and I saw that there was one from like a week ago where he's standing behind this other girl for a mirror selfie pressed against her with his hands through her belt loops. I showed it to him and asked him about it and he said she just wanted to look like she was in a relationship with him because another guy way creeping on her, and he said I could ask her and she would confirm it. Then I asked if I could go on his phone to get her number and he said no and that he would get it for me, but since then he hasn't let me see his phone at all and changed the passcode on it. And he still hasn't given me her number to text her to ask about it. 

I've stopped pressing the issue because I think he could just tell her to lie and use the same story so texting her would be kind of pointless but does it sound like I'm getting played? Should I get her number anyways? I'm not sure what to do in this situation and would really appreciate any advice.

Hi, I need some advice. My sister was in a relationship with her boyfriend [31 M] for about 10 years. She had two daughters with him and she was very close with them, and by all accounts a good mother. Her and her boyfriend fought a bit though. 


She got weight loss surgery about a year ago and suddenly changed. She immediately cheated and broke up with her boyfriend and began ""seeing"" someone halfway across the country. She lives with my parents with my two nieces and during the past year she started flying out there to see him, trying to get pregnate and apparently had a miscarriage, which we all just found out about. 


She has been neglecting my nieces for awhile now. Staying in her room and talking for hours with this guy. A couple weeks ago my older niece broke her pinky at school playing tetherball. And during the visit to the doctor she told my niece that she is now moving out to live with the guy and start a new family. My family is stunned. 


I live four hours away so I don't know all the details but apparently she kept most of this hidden from my family. My parents willingly watched and cared for my nieces. Her boyfriend gets them half the week and my family gets them the other half. I'm [27 M] extremely close to both of my nieces and came down to visit them because of all that is happening. My family and her boyfriend will apparently take care of my nieces. I'm at a loss of what to do or what to say to my nieces. Everyone is extremely upset and a few of us are done with my sister and want nothing to do with her ever again. She's planning on leaving in about five or six months. 

I don't think there is anything to do but does anyone have advice on how to deal with this situation? It's a mindf*ck. I'm seeing my niece later today. Does anyone know what I can say to her to make her feel better and to help?

Big thanks to everyone who left a comment in the original post. Your input was very helpful! 


I have since talked to Lucas. Again, Miles' idea. His logic was simple. Lucas told me the truth because he was ready to let go and get over me, or rather, whatever idea of me he had in his head. Miles thinks keeping Lucas as best man at our wedding will be punishment enough. As brutal as that sounds, I can't help but agree. Lucas isn't a child and shouldn't be treated like one. I think he knows we're disappointed in him. Worried and sympathetic, but disappointed just the same. If he were truly looking to split the engagement, I feel like he would have taken a more sophisticated approach than drunk dialling me. In any case, we had a chat at mine and Miles' house. Miles was home, in his study working. Lucas and I had lunch in the kitchen. 


To my relief, he did not feign ignorance. We talked for maybe twenty or thirty minutes. He told me he originally wanted to ask me out in university but waited too long, and then stepped aside when he saw that I was interested in his brother instead. He said he left the voice message without agenda, and I believe him. The way he was talking, his words came off more cathartic and apologetic than hopeful. They didn't come off hopeful at all, actually. 


He made sure to say our friendship was still genuine and whatever we've gone through since we met, was untainted. The moments of ""what if?"" were brief, he said, but heavy. By the end of our talk, he was able to admit that maybe his feelings stem from desire for a relationship similar to mine and Miles', and not so much desire for *me*. I told him he's still very welcome to the wedding if he feels he's ready for something like that, and he told me he'll be there for sure. We left it at that. 


All in all, I'm confident everything will be okay. It might take a while before we're normal around each other, but we had a chance to talk and clear the air, and right now that's good enough for me. 


TL;DR - Lucas and I chatted. We're good. Miles is good. Everything's good.

"Making my(27f) husband(33m) choose between his ""hobby"" and me.


My husband of 3 years, together 8+ years, has spent the last 2 years pursuing a (rap) music career. We have 2 boys, 8y and 5y. At first it started casual, Tuesday's at a friends just messing around in the studio, and has escalated to him actively trying to make this his career,  building a studio in our basement and having up to 5-6 guys here daily (usually only half bother to show) ""working on music"" (usually just partying in the basement although I know my husband is trying to do more than party). 

He's gone through 3 groups of artists in 2 years, built 4 studios in various peoples houses which he lost access to after the groups fell apart, he's had 1 small show in which half his partners forgot their words, and 3 or 4 cancelled shows. We've financed everything alone from all these studios to CDs to liquor and snacks everyday and had my electic bills ran up since sometimes people are here for literally 12 hours, my house shaking with repetitive beats. Our finances are joint and, truthfully I bring in more money. So, basically I'm financing most of it. 

I've been unbelievably supportive. From helping promote to dealing with his adding every girl in a bikini on  facebook to ""promote"" his music to, to paying out so much money and never making a single dime back or getting a dime of financial help from his partners, to spending long nights in studios with him just so we could still be with eachother, to now losing him every second of the day except maybe an hour late at night to the studio.  

He still seems to think that this money and time suck is going to make him a millionaire someday despite his being a 33 year old white guy. I've tried talking to him and compromising a million times and I've finally admitted to myself that I can't live this life. I've decided he has to choose between me and his music. I feel so guilty for considering an ultimatum, but at this point we want drastically different things in life. He wanted to settle down and have kids and so we did, and i'm focused on mothering and adulting. Then a year after marriage he decided to become a rapper. If this is what's most important to him, he should be able to choose that and eventually find a woman who wants to live that way. I don't,  I've tried and I'm now a miserable snappy person because I'm alone all the time because I don't want to go party in the freaking basement like I'm 17. 

 It's not like he doesn't have other hobbies. Its not like we didn't have career plans. But instead of trying to write a book or open a restaurant like we planned, he delivers pizza and raps. I bartend because it gives me the most time at home with the best income, but now that both kids are in school we had always planned to get day jobs and frankly I want to be able to retire someday. I need a ""real job"" for that and so does he. 

Anyways, I know this was a novel. My question is, is this wrong for me to make him choose? I'm against ultimatums. They're not healthy. But I feel like he has to choose. Choose music and seperate and live our seperate lives, or choose me and hang up his mic for good. I feel like a rotten wife but also know at this point neither of us can be happy with this arrangement. 



Tl;dr: husband wants to be a famous rapper, spends all his time and our money trying to make it happen, I want him to quit it or I'm out. Feel bad for planning to give him an ultimatum, but it I don't,  divorce is inevitable anyways."

"I (58/f) found out my son-in-law (30/m) gave my grandson (6mths/m) a name my late daughter (28/f) did not want


I just found this out and I'm devastated, I often browse reddit but I don't post often so I'm sorry if this doesn't meet the rules of this subreddit.

My daughter, Becky died 9 hours after her son Tommy was born.  It was a pulmonary embolism.  She had been on bed rest for the last 2 months of her pregnancy, which they believe caused her to develop deep vein thrombosis.  It was completely unexpected, she was otherwise healthy.  This was a wanted pregnancy that she and her husband Tom wanted very much.  The only silver lining is that Tommy is a wonderful, happy, healthy baby but two families are broken and we are all doing our best to hold ourselves together for Tommy.

Becky and Tom didn't tell anyone what the sex of the baby was when she was pregnant and they didn't tell anyone any names they were thinking about.  Becky did tell me once that she and Tom were having a hard time agreeing on the name, but she never mentioned the name to me.  Then, a week before she died, she told me that they had decided on a name.  She said that she didn't want to tell me because they agreed to keep it a secret until the baby was here but that she knew it would make me happy. Becky died before she could tell anyone what they had named the baby.  Tom told us the baby was named Thomas Jr.  I thought it was a fine name and didn't think much about Becky's comment until later.

I have been coming over regularly to help Tom with the baby and I thought I had a very good relationship with Tom.  Tom has said many times that he wants Tommy to have a close relationship with my family since that's the only connection Tommy will have to his mother.


A month ago, Tom gave me a box of Becky's things that he thought I might like to have.  I was very grateful but couldn't look at them right away.  Last night I opened the box and he had included some of Becky's journals.  I read through them and was planning to give them back to Tom for Tommy, so Tommy could read about his mom's life when he gets older.  I was reading through the journal she kept when she was pregnant with Tommy.  In it, she talked about how hard it was for her and Tom to agree on a name.  Once they found out they were having a boy, Tom was insistent that the baby was Thomas Jr. Becky wrote that she didn't like the idea and that they fought a lot.  Becky wrote that they compromised on a name: Henry (my late father's name and a family name dating back a long time) James (Tom's late grandfather's name).  She even wrote that she had ordered some things for the nursery with that monogram.

I don't even know what to feel.  Tom ignored my daughter and his wife's wishes right after her death.  He took away a connection that Tommy could have had to his mother's family. While I will always love Tommy, I don't want anything to do with Tom right now but I need to have a relationship with him to have a relationship with Tommy.  I wonder what he did with the things that Becky bought for her son.  I haven't seen them in Tommy's nursery.  That means Tom threw away things that Tommy could have kept, knowing his mother bought them for him with him in mind.

I want Tommy to have Becky's journals.  My pan was to copy a few passages for myself and give the originals back to Tom. Now, i'm wondering if I should keep them and give them to Tommy myself when he's older.

How to I forgive my son-in-law for disrespecting my late daughter's wish?  What do I do with the journals?  Should I confront Tom about what he's done?


tl;dr- my son-in law disrespected my late daughter's wishes about the name of their child.  What do I do?"
"I (24F) caught my best friend"" (23F) telling hurtful lies about me. We are currently travelling the world together.


I'm currently travelling with ""Linda"" whom I considered to be one of my best friends.  We have differing personalities.  I tend to be straightforward and direct, while Linda has the tendency to be passive aggressive.  We recently met a local guy in the Philippines, and she agreed to go on a motorbike ride with him at around 10:00 pm.  I told her that I felt uncomfortable with her going, to which she assured ""I'll be fine. I'm only gone for an hour"" and left.  Alarm bells were going off and I started panicking. We've only literally met this guy once and we're foreigners in a strange country where we don't speak the local language.  So I grabbed her laptop to message her bf on Facebook and these are the messages I see.

"" I think I know why I'm feeling this way [presumably , this way referring to being upset].  It's because of [my name].""  She then goes on to say several horrible things about me that are just outright lies.  In short, that I'm dirty, lazy, and cheap along with some made up stories to demonstrate how lazy and cheap I am.  When i confronted her, she admitted that none of those things were true.  Not only that, but she'd not only been saying these things about me to her boyfriend,  but also to her other friends as well.  

Apparently, she bottles up her issues and ""picking"" at other people's problems makes her feel better. She said she didn't mean anything she had said about me and apologized a few times.

Honestly, I feel really hurt and betrayed.  My question is, should I end the trip early and just go back home?  I personally don't feel like travelling for the next two months with someone I can't trust.  Or should I just suck it up, try to fix the friendship, and head home in January?  Is our relationship even worth salvaging?  

Tldr:  I caught my ""best friend"" telling lies about me behind my back and don't know if I should salvage the friendship or just end the trip and go home."
"Update -- Me [26/F] with my [26/M] 6months, can't stop feeling anxiety and like I'm walking on eggshells after being accused of cheating


op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59dda4/me_26f_with_my_26m_6months_cant_stop_feeling/

Well, it ended. But not because I particularly wanted it to. I can't believe the level of drama that was achieved yesterday, Jesus fuck. 

I changed the passcode on my phone the day after writing my first post here, and it seems that he must have been checking it cause the timing was just too good. He was acting weird all night afterwards and not sleeping or whatever, I was sleeping fine. Went to work, got some normal sounding texts then all of a sudden a bunch of ""fucks"" and I get told he got fired from his job. Seemed weird, he made it seem like he had gotten in a fight with a coworker he doesn't like, but now I'm pretty sure he just quit.

Anyways... spend all day texting about it, he ends up saying some shit like he doesn't like it here (he moved here to be with me) and wants to go back home. I was really hurt cause I don't think that's even true, but whatever. 

I get home and he's packed up like 1/3 of his shit and immediately starts laying into me to ""tell the truth"". Great, it's another cheating debacle. I got pissed. He tells me he went through my location services history on my Google account (hadn't had a chance to change my laptop password yet) and saw that I went to a hotel and a random apartment. Must be cheating, right? Except I work in a busy downtown area and I sometimes eat at a hotel restaurant. And the apartment belongs to my married friends. That and it looked like the location services was not particularly accurate because I know where I work and it's not where the app thinks I do. 

So he packed the rest of his shit up and left. He eventually believed me so it was extremely depressing. I really wanted it to work out but I can't live like that and he knows he has issues.

Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58iyl0/i_21m_am_worried_my_alpha_male_friend23m_is/
Commenters were pretty split on if I should break up with her or not but I definitely wasn't going to do that without trying to fix things first. So I decided to take the advice of one commenter and take her on more dates and get her out of the house. It was a good idea and it seems to have made us closer.  

One time we were in bed together  and she left to go to the toilet, leaving messages open with one of her friends. I couldn't resist. I scrolled up until I got to a bit where they were discussing their love lives. She said ""[my name] has been so sweet lately but I can't keep my mind off vince"". Her friend then asked if she would get with Vince if given the chance. Tia said ""obviously I like him but I couldn't do that to [my name]""
Her friend asked ""what are you gonna do?""
Tia said ""I hope it just goes away naturally but I see him so often I'm not sure I will. I think [my name] knows as well""
Her friend then told Tia that it wasn't her fault she had a crush but she needed to stop it before she cheated.
tia then said ""I love [my name] more  its just confusing""
And that was it.

I decided to approach the topic with Tia. She admitted to having a crush on him and we agreed to try and spend less time at my house so that we see him less. Obviously I'm hurt but I think we can get through it. After reading her messages I'm confident she won't cheat and hopefully if we work on us for a bit her crush will go away. 

I also decided not to talk to Vince since it seems like this was mostly Tia's problem, though his attitude around her obviously helped develop the crush.

I'm still worried that I'll never be good enough for Tia. I can still picture her hanging on to his every word while he tells one of his stories where he comes across as infinitely cooler than me. I could never be like him and it sucks that she finds that sort of person attractive. Oh well. I don't think she's a bad person, I just hope we can work through it. 

Thanks reddit ✌

"I [22F] was angrily confronted about ruining an ex fling's (27M) marriage that I never knew existed.


For backstory, back during March/April of this year, I had a brief fling with a casual friend-of-friend (who we'll call Marcus) through co workers. Marcus was a really nice guy and very good looking, and after a pretty rough breakup he was a really good rebound for me. 

VERY early on, he told me about how he had gotten a girlfriend pregnant not too long ago, (Shelby) and they had a daughter together (under the age of 3). He told me he and Shelby had gotten married immediately when she was pregnant, but she eventually confessed to him after their daughter was born she was not attracted to men and was a lesbian, and ended up moving overseas to be with family. He told me they had not divorced, as this would make it easier for him to send money and visit, and I never disputed because I'm 22 years old and know nothing about those sort of legal issues. Multiple coworkers (and best friend Rachel, who is also a coworker) who also had known him for much longer than myself, told me this also was true, so I never doubted it.

Around the end of June things with Marcus and I fizzled out, as I knew he and I would never be serious and I met my current boyfriend (Sean). At that point, Marcus and I stopped communicating (whether it be social media, or messaging). I had found out from coworkers during the middle of July, that he had starting dating another mutual friend of ours (Sarah, who I am close to and like,) and at that point I even went out with our group of friends including Marcus and Sarah together. There has never been an issue.

Last week, Rachel told me that Shelby had arrived back in the country from overseas, and out of respect for his family situation he had chosen to end things with Sarah. I didn't think anything of it, until today during the first 5 minutes of my work day, I received the angriest text message I've ever read in my life. 

I don't want to be too specific but it was so ridiculous, that for the first paragraph I assumed it was a text message to the wrong number and I laughed out loud. The unidentified woman called me a whore, told me I hoped I was happy that I ruined a family and a marriage, and a proceeded to call me horrible names. 

I 100% thought this was a text to the wrong person until I read ""and in case you're fucking too many other married men, this is Marcus's wife."" That's when it all clicked in to me that he had obviously lied about his relationship status. I still have no idea how she knows who I am, or how she found me. I spoke to Rachel, and as far as we both know, Sarah has not gotten the same message.

Now I'm just wondering how to go from here. Do I call her or text her and tell her my point of view? She was extremely angry in the message and not seemingly open to ANY sort of conversation or understanding or even wanting to know my point of view. Do I try? And I guess my next question is, if the answer is ""don't try"" how do I gain closure from this? My own parents divorced when my father cheated on my mother, and feeling like I just caused this exact pain on someone else is killing me. 

Also, to married people, would you even want to know your spouse lied and said you were gay and left the country? Would it be enough to know they cheated and move on, without knowing the horrible things they said?

Thanks everyone in advance.

"My [27F] parents [57M and 60F] let my uncle [50sM], who sexually assaulted me at 15, live with them and didn't tell me until after I bought a plane ticket to go see them.


My uncle molested me for 6 months when I was 15, when he tried to rape me unsuccessfully for the umpteenth time, I had finally had enough and reported him and he went to prison for 3 years.  I moved to another state in 2010 to get away from my parents. My father was very abusive growing up, and as soon as I had an out, I left home and never went back.  

My relationship with my parents improved over the 6 years I've been gone. I decided this year that I would go back to see them because it's been so long.  I bought the ticket. We had discussed the possibility of me visiting them in December, and, finally having enough money to see them, I decided to buy the ticket.

I call them up really happy and excited to finally see my family (parents, grandmother, sister, cousins, etc), and my dad tells me, ""oh, by the way, I let my brother live with us."" I asked which one, afraid of the answer, and sure enough, they've let my sexual predator of an uncle live with them.

I'm so devastated and feel absolutely betrayed. I don't know what to do. I can't believe this is happening.

They tell me it's because he's a born again Christian and has changed his ways, but this guy just got out of prison this month after spending 2 years there for possession of drugs and attacking someone with a knife.  He got out for good behavior.  My parents are super religious, and they're big believers in forgiveness, but this... This is too much.

I know know know it's because he's paying them money to live with them. My parents are both on disability, but live beyond their means and are addicted to prescription opioids.  They used to steal from me and my sister and threaten to throw us out if we didn't give them money. They'll pretend to be in more pain than they are, and get even more drugs than they need, and then sell the excess to support their extravagant lifestyle.

I'm mad that they haven't changed since I left, and they misled me into thinking they had, and that I believed them. I'm devastated that they would let someone who hurt me so badly live with them.  I tried to kill myself 3 months later at 15 because of all the pain and because of the way my family treated me afterwards.  I just can't even deal right now. 

TL;DR: parents let my piece of shit uncle who sexually assaulted me live with them because he's a born again Christian but didn't tell me about it until after I had bought a ticket to go see them. How should I proceed from here?

Edit: I'm very overwhelmed by the level of support you guys have shown me.  I don't want to visit them, but I still want to see my homestate and have fun with friends and relatives and my former foster mother. I'll update you all in December."

Throwaway account, as family is on reddit.

Here's my mother: 58, loud, bossy, genuinely warm. Meets you and 30 seconds later knows all your business and is offering advice. Likes hugs (*long* hugs), detailed heart-to-heart conversations, and starting sentences with ""I feel.""

Here's me: 31, autistic. Verbal when I want to be. Don't touch me or ask about my feelings. Seriously, *don't* touch me unless you ask me in advance. 

More relevant stuff about me: I have a good job (I make ~$50k a year), an apartment (I live alone), a car, friends, pets, etc. I think, overall, that I'm doing okay though of course there are things that I think could be better.

I'm also single.

While the *idea* of not being single appeals, the idea of going out and doing the dating thing does *not.* I'd prefer to jump straight to being in a committed relationship. I'm not a idiot and know this is impossible, and am thus okay with being alone.

My mother is *not* okay with this.

Her fears:

 * I'll die alone

 * No one will be able to take care of me

 * I'll be vulnerable as an old person

 * Grandchildren!


My rebuttals:

 * I have friends

 * Nursing homes exist

 * See above

 * She **has** grandchildren.


My mother is also 100% Not Okay with the fact that I'd prefer to be partnered with a woman, and not a man, and the fact that I'm pretty vehemently opposed to the idea of getting pregnant.

Every conversation I have with my mother involves her telling me that:

 * When she was my age she had 3 children

 * If I did my hair/wore makeup/dressed better I could *totally* land a Nice Young Man

 * The other day she met a Nice Young Man who has [Good Job], do I want his number?

 * Children Are The Best

 * Jesus Saves 


In response to this, I have basically stopped communicating with her, except via intermediaries (my siblings are great), text, and terse phone calls. Which, of course, makes me a Bad Daughter and Ungrateful. So she wants to meet so we can hug it out.

"UPDATE I've [26/f] noticed some weird things about my boyfriend's [28] behavior since we moved in together


[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52ia3q/ive_26f_noticed_some_weird_things_about_my/) my first post. I got a lot of feedback and PMs, so I feel that I should pop in to say what's been going on.

So...my boyfriend is into pegging and sissification, and overall loves being dominated. He has been seeing a dominatrix, and his best friend has been covering for him.

He has a collection of lingerie, dildos, and prostate massagers, which is what he'd been keeping in the box in the closet.

Prior to confirming all of this, I had come to the conclusion that it wouldn't bother me if he were paying someone to perform certain acts for him; it would only bother me if he'd developed an emotional connection to someone else. So, what wound up concerning me is the fact that he didn't feel as though he could talk to me and open up to me.

I am not completely comfortable dominating him, but I told him that I was willing to use the massagers on him and take more initiative in the bedroom for his benefit. I also have no problem with him wearing lingerie. Honestly, it's kind of hot. That said, I also asked him to go to couples' counseling so that we could work on openness and communication. He blanched at first, but he's come around, and we have our first appointment next week.

Since I don't mind him seeing a dominatrix, and I'm not able to do some of what he wants, I've told him that he can keep on keeping on, as it were. He has said that he's going to suspend his activities until we've worked things out.

This isn't something that's totally fixed by any means, but it's on the path to resolution. And I appreciate everyone who either commented or sent me messages; you are lovely.

Thank you.

  TL;DR: Boyfriend has been seeing a dominatrix to express his kinks. We are going to go to counseling to work on our communication.

Edit: Based on responses I've been getting, I thought it would be a good idea to make an edit for clarification.

While I am okay with Craig seeing a domme, I am not okay with the fact that he was lying about it. I need him to be open and transparent with me in the future. If, after all of this and counseling, he shows that he's unable to do that, then that's the point where I'll need to leave.

I see it as something that can be fixed, and I would like to give finding a resolution a try. "

"[23 M] with my [24 F] for six years, I can't tell my girlfriend that I'm upset because she just gets more upset in response.


Hello, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a while and I've always found it really hard to talk to my girlfriend about my problems or things that are bothering me. 

FYI she has anxiety problems and she's finally seeing someone about but hasn't seen much improvement from my perspective. 

Basically, if I say ""You've done X and it bothered me because Y."" she gets upset at herself for getting me upset. Then she gets anxious about how I'm going to leave her. Then these emotions swell into her crying or having some kind of panic attack. Then me being upset turns into me comforting her because she's so upset. And the worst part is that she knows she does this, she acknowledges it and that makes her even more upset. I just don't see a solution here.  

I don't know what to do because it feels like I can never tell her how I'm feeling without her having extreme reactions. So I just keep things bottled up and then that's not healthy.

  **tl;dr**: Can't get upset at girlfriend without her getting more upset in response. Don't know what to do.

**Conclusion:**
Alright, I think I've caught up on all of the comments. I'm sorry if I didn't reply to you directly but I can promise you I've read and considered every one.

I think the main points I'm taking away are: less time spent consoling, more solo time for her, scheduling a couples session with her therapist so that I can try to get more/better exercises for her, and more time spent on fixing myself. I know a popular opinion is that I need to end the relationship but I really do love her and I think that fixing the relationship would be worth it. I'll be giving it another few months trying to apply some of the advice you guys have given me. If things still aren't working out then a break will be in order.

I have removed the edit because this has gotten rather popular and I don't want her to stumble on it. The rant gave away too much information.

I also want to leave a thank you for all of the comments. A big part of the stress involved with this is thinking that I've gone crazy. You begin knowing what's normal and what's not but over time that line blurs. You start to doubt that it isn't normal behavior. So I just wanted to say thanks for the support.

I'll continue to check in and read any additional comments but I think my mind is pretty much set on how to proceed."
"[22M] boyfriend broke down crying and threw a tantrum last night because I [18F] wouldn't have sex with him

"Me [26F] with my Fiance [26M] of 5 years, I feel crazy for considering ending our engagement over chores


I would like to begin by saying that I love my fiance very very much. He is kind, patient, hilariously funny, fun, level-headed, and a great friend (to me and to all of his friends). We have known each other for 7+ years and were great friends for a year and a half before we started dating.


We were long-distance for three years while I was in grad school in another state. Soon after graduating and passing my licensing exams last fall, I secured a job in his city (also where we went to undergrad--our plan was always for me to come back here). He was living with a roommate and I moved into my fiance's room, with the approval of his roommate and my share of the rent/utilities, of course. It's not as if I was stunned by fiance's inability to keep house when I moved in--I saw his apartment when I would visit for weekends during grad school. However, during our long distance time, he always made sure to pick up before I arrived for a weekend, and would take care of a chore (taking out the trash if it smelled, cleaning the bathroom so I could use it) right away if I asked him. 


So, I live with him and the roommate and the two of us are working full-time through spring of this year. Unfortunately, I lost my job this spring and was without consistent employment for a few months (I did do temp work as much as I could). During these few months, I did my best to keep busy with job applications and interviews, but when I had spare time I spent it cleaning the apartment. I had to temporarily reduce my rent/utilities contributions so I thought it was only fair to make up for that with taking over the lion's share of the chores (plus I was home most of the day, so it made sense). During my unemployment, my fiance and I got engaged and then a few weeks later, moved out of the apartment with the roommate and into our own, first-ever just the two of us apartment. I was very excited.


Shortly after our move, I got a good, permanent, job offer and accepted it. As it stands now, I commute 40-60 minutes one way depending on traffic, and my fiance commutes 45-90 minutes depending on traffic (it is not unusual for him to spend and hour and a half in the car on the way home). 


So, the problem now, and the point of this post, is that I feel like I have no help with household chores. He will leave dishes in the sink for days at a time (we have no dishwasher so they all have to be done by hand). Sweeping/vacuuming/mopping just does not occur to him, even if there is a clear mess directly in front of him. Same with cleaning the bathroom, even if the sink is full of his hair from shaving. Often he will actually do these chores (dishes, cleaning the bathroom sink) after being reminded several days in a row. 


All of these are frustrating, but laundry is by far the worst. Trying to get him to do laundry is like pulling teeth. He will put it off as long as possible, until the hamper is overflowing and I have to do a couple of loads just to keep our bedroom from being overrun by laundry. Sometimes he will start a load of laundry and then let it sit in the washer, cycle completed and clothes wet, until I go and switch it over because I do not want to wear smelly clothes to work. 


Tonight was a major argument that led me to post this. I am facing a deadline in about two weeks from now at work. So, they have been having us work a lot of hours, including from home after we leave the office. Monday-Wednesday of this week, I worked several hours at night. Last night, I think my fiance could tell I was getting frustrated with work/wedding planning/chores, because he stated late last night ""I'm going to do a bunch of laundry tomorrow night."" I was excited--I knew it would probably still require my assistance but I was grateful that he was offering on his own. I told him that if I got home before him, I would start the first load. So, tonight I get home from work and right away start a load of laundry. When my fiance gets home, about 15 minutes later, I tell him that there's a load in the wash, he says thanks. Probably 90 minutes later, I remind him that there is wet wash in the machine that has to be switched over tonight; he says OK. 11:00pm and he's getting ready for bed, I again remind him about the laundry and he whines and complains telling me he'll do it tomorrow. I say no, it has to be switched tonight, it can't sit wet overnight or it might smell. He immediately gets defensive and tells me I never reminded him about the load, it's not his fault, he'll get it tomorrow. He tells me ""I said I'm sorry and that's it, I don't know what more you want me to do about it."" I want you to get up off your ass and switch the goddamn laundry!!!!!! But no. After this argument where we both yelled, which is very unusual for us, he got up and went to bed. I think I should add that he seemed to have ""forgotten"" after he realized that I am working from home tomorrow. I'm not sure if he thinks that just because I will be physically home tomorrow means that I can clean the house like I used to when I was unemployed, but I cannot. And, even if I could, I wouldn't because it is time he takes responsibility for half of the household chores.


I have tried in basically every way I can think of to get my fiance to help with chores, and with laundry specifically. At first, I would wash and fold his laundry and leave it in baskets, so all he had to do was put it away--I stopped that PDQ after seeing that the baskets would sit in our bedroom, literally next to his dresser, sometimes for weeks at a time. I have begged him. I have sobbed. I have gotten mad. I have tried to trade off chores (I'll do the laundry if you do the dishes). I have told him that our engagement rests on his help with chores (I have tried very hard not to issue empty treats and so have not yet given an ultimatum). Obviously, none of these have worked. I am at my wit's end. I have tried removing my laundry from our shared hamper and doing only my own. That works to get my own clothes clean but does nothing to keep our bedroom tidy and stop the hamper from overflowing. I feel absolutely terrible about ending an otherwise-great relationship with a wonderful human being over some chores. However, I know I cannot live the rest of my life as a maid. Also, I would like to add that I could conceivably take care of all of these chores on my own. We live in a small apartment and do not produce this much laundry. However, I do not want to and do not believe I should be required to do this all on my own. So, I am left in a situation where my clothes stay dirty for an additional week unless I do them; my favorite tupperware or the dishes we need for supper stay dirty unless I wash them; or I have to use a bathroom sink full of hair unless I clean it. I do not believe it is unreasonable to ask to live in a world where the sink is somehow free of my fiance's facial hair without actually having to remove that hair myself.


So, I am turning to the good people of Reddit to help me out here. Does anyone have any suggestions for another approach? Has anyone ever successfully navigated this problem? What should I do and how should I talk to my fiance about this?


 
  **tl;dr**: My fiance, whom I love very very much, rarely if ever helps me with household chores (mostly laundry). I need help getting this issue settled before our wedding. "
"My (34F) family has disowned an uncle (67M) I love over inheritance


My grandmother passed away and left her house and all her assets to my uncle (1 of 5 children). He had lived with her for 50 years, including cooking and cleaning, and contributing to the house financially with his disability checks. 3 out of 4 of the remaining children (my aunts and uncles) freaked the hell out, tried to take him to court (failed) and since then have made his life a misery by harrassing him and insulting him, saying they were entitled to an equal share of the house and if he was a decent human being he would sell the house and split it. This actually made him quite ill and they backed off, freaking out about him dying and who was left in his will. Finally they were soooo generous (/s) and said they would leave him alone if he made a will saying it would be left to all of them equally. Hoping for him to die soon, I guess.

Well he refused to say who he was going to leave his stuff to in his will. He said it was none of their business. Now those 3 aunts and uncles, as well as their children (5 children, his nieces and nephews) have declared he is no longer family because he stole their inheritance and clearly didn't care about them.

My mother and I are still visiting him, but otherwise he is an isolated, disabled guy in his 60s who has now been dropped by his entire family. No christmas, no birthdays, no invitation to family events. He's had to deal with being disabled his entire life, and caring for his mother, now she's dead and the majority of his family have turned their backs on him over money (it is not even a massive sum of money, the house is worth £200k and there was £50k savings). So a decent amount but it's not like he has millions and is hoarding it, he has the house he has lived in for 50 years and contributed to the upkeep and mortgage of for 50 years, plus a bit of savings that will probably need to be spent on the house over the years as it needs some work done, and his disability checks.

I am disgusted by my families actions - his brother and sisters have abandoned him over money, and all their kids are just going along with it. I want to cut them all out of my life for good. They have insulted him, harrassed him, tried to take him to court, they've made him sicker, and demonstrated they never cared about him or his health. I don't want myself or my daughter (6 months) to have anything to do with them anymore, and my husband agrees.

However, my mum is begging me to still go to family events with her. We do big family celebrations, bbqs, christmas, birthdays, restaurant meals out. She wants me to go along (without my uncle as he is now banned from ALL family events) and just smile and pretend it's okay, because she says she ""doesn't want me to end up like him - shunned."" Well I'm ok with that, 100%. They have never done anything for me and if they are willing to shrug off family members over feeling entitled to an inheritance (none of them even care that if the house had been split he would be homeless and disabled since he wouldn't have the cash to buy a new place - none of them will acknowledge that he deserves the house considering he actually financially contributed to it for 50 years whereas they didn't spend a penny on it). 

My mum loves all her brothers and sisters even though they are doing this and is begging me not to ""rock the boat"" as it could come back on her and she can't imagine a life without all these family gatherings. She agrees that he deserves the house and she did not take part in the court attempt to question the inheritence, and she is still going to visit him privately - but she won't stand against the rest of the family either.

What should I do in your opinion? Go and let my daughter be brought up around people who would do this or stand my ground and say if they aren't willing to treat him fairly then they are not going to be part of my life either? Either way I will still be visiting my ""shunned"" uncle every week and my daughter will get to know him, there is no way I am partaking in this pathetic coventry just to try and make him so emotionally vulnerable he will give them the house I feel he is perfectly entitled to. If I keep seeing the family as normal I feel like I am condoning or taking part in his exclusion. If I refuse and say exclude me to if you can't be decent human beings, it will very much upset my mum, and may even have consequences for her as my family can be very petty and vindictive and don't like people disagreeing with them.

  **tl;dr**: My disabled uncle has been disowned due to receiving an inheritance that wasn't split between the rest of the family. I feel he deserves it; they don't and having failed to take it in court, have now decided as a family to shun him. I am not taking part in this, and I don't want to take part in family events where he is excluded. My mother is begging me not to cause problems and to just go along with it because she is scared of being shunned too but the whole thing makes me sick and I want nothing to do with them."
