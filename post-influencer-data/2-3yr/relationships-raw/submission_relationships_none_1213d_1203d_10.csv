"[UPDATE] My [25F] professor [30M] asked me to go on a date after I graduate next month


[Here is the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lvz0t/my_25f_professor_30m_asked_me_to_go_on_a_date/)

Hi everyone! I just wanted to thank you all for your comments on my last post :) They really helped me. I was asked for an update so here we go...

Anyways, I think I should have worded myself better. I wrote the post on May 30th and my convocation was on June 4th. I put ""next month"" in the title but realistically, I should have put ""next week."" I digress. Looking back, the timeline is probably confusing but this post should clear it up.

First and foremost, I GOT A JOB :) It is at quite a large PR firm within the city and I start next week. They didn't ask me for references, but instead, told me they looked at my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had quite a few recommendations there, so they were satisfied with that. I'm so excited!!

So I never ended up using Mark's letter of recommendation. After posting, I decided that I do want to explore something romantic with him. I immediately felt better after getting some third party advice, so the next day, I emailed him (I didn't have his phone number) and said this:

""Mark,

First off, I want to say that I am incredibly grateful for the recommendation letter you compiled for me. I have a second interview tomorrow at one of the agencies I was telling you about. I'm a bit anxious but also quite excited. 

I just wanted to let you know that I will not be using the letter after all. I thought about what you asked me and I am very interested in going out to dinner with you. You have been an awesome mentor this last semester but I am ready to see a different side of you. I promise we don't have to get Indian food :)

I wanted to apologize if I seemed standoffish when you asked me; I wasn't expecting it and it took me a while to process it all. 

Again, thank you for the letter. Maybe I will see you at convocation this Saturday? And, just in case you may want it, here's my number 555-555-5555. ""

(The Indian food  bit was from when he was sick one day and said he is 99% sure he got food poisoning from trying a butter chicken dish at a dive bar)

Anyways, I received a text from him an hour later and we have been talking ever since. On Friday, I found out I got the job and told him. He said he wasn't surprised and I would do really well there.

Saturday was my convocation. My parents flew down and it was great! I saw Mark at the mixer and he had a huge grin on his face and waved. I was busy taking photos and whatnot and noticed he left later on. He told me he didn't want to spoil my day and said we would talk soon.

We decided to go out to dinner yesterday (Sunday). To keep it short, it was great, he was great and he walked me back to my condo. We said goodnight and he started walking away. I was kind of disappointed and turned to walk into the door but I heard him call my name and he kissed me :) He said he's still new at this.

Anyways this post was probably all over the place but I'm actually just feeling really giddy and excited. Between the new job, finally graduating and the lovely date I had with my ex-super-hot-prof, I'm on cloud nine right now.

Thanks for everything guys! Your advice really helped!
   
TLDR: Got a new job, graduated and went on a date with Mark. He's a good kisser. I'm happy."
"UPDATE: My [18 M] girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months found out how much I make in a month. Now she expects me to spoil her regularly.


[Part I:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n82kn/my_18_m_girlfriend_20_f_of_6_months_found_out_how/)

Before I start this, Just let me say how thankful I am to everyone that commented. I read everything when I had time, and the advice really helped me with my decisions that followed. 

Last night, I did a lot of thinking, played a lot of Overwatch, and read a lot of comments. One thing that stood out to me most, was to change my passwords, so I did immediately. After that, around 9pm, I packed up everything she's left at my place, (Enough to fill a medium box) and everything she's ever given me. (One plushie elephant).

I wasn't bitter or anything, I just knew that enough was enough and she isn't who she was when we first started hanging out. I drove to her house and we talked before I gave her the box. 

She was very insistent that how she was acting is acceptable, and that ""things were going to change between us"" if we were to stay together. I said I'd rather not, went to my car and brought her the box. I told her she could keep everything I've given her, and I left. 

Later last night, my phone exploded with texts from all of her friends. They called me names, said I wasn't a man, and just generally harassed me. I didn't respond to any of the texts, and instead just went to bed early. 

Work today was a breeze, all my coworkers were very nice and helpful, a girl I've had a little crush on even took me to lunch. (Tacos, hell yeah.) Overall, today was pretty solid. 

She's been calling and texting still, mainly just berating me, (You're not man enough for me anyway, I never really loved you), and honestly I'm glad she did that, because it made getting over her a much easier process. 

When I got home just a little while ago, she was at my apartment. She was crying and asking me to take her back, saying she was so sorry for the things she said and it would never happen again. Now, normally, I'm kind of a push-over. (I was probably hugged too much as a kid, shout-out to my parents) But in this instance, I stood up for myself and told her what she did was wrong and immoral, and that she should just leave. 

She went into anger mode again and started screaming at me. I told her to get the fuck off my porch before I call the complex's security, and she left pretty quickly after that. 

The only real problem I have with any of this, is how little I care about it. Instead, I feel very relieved that she's gone and I don't have to deal with her anymore. I guess my family felt the same, because when I told them, the collective response was, ""Oh thank god.""

The kicker for me in all this is a pretty hopeful one. Me and the aforementioned girl from work have had each other's numbers for quite a while now, and we only used them for work reasons. When I went inside my apartment after telling my ex off, I saw that I got a text from her. The full message said, ""Hey! I know this might be a little forward, but do you want to hang out this weekend?"" I responded with a resounding hell yes, and we made a plan of it. She wants to take me out for dinner, and then go back to her house and make ou-I mean, watch Animaniacs on Netflix.

Reddit, I'm being taken on a motherfuckin' date. This has never happened to me before and advice on that situation would be much appreciated. (Do I put out?)



   
**tl;dr**: Changed my passwords, stood up for myself, dumped her ass and got a date. Feeling pretty great about my situation. "

"My [30s] BIL [30s] tried to ruin my wedding. He is upset I cut the stupidity out of my wedding video.


I [34F] got married to my boyfriend Dan [35M]. We have been together for 5 years now. We have been married two months now.

Dan has two siblings. Moira [32F] is great, I love her like my own sister. Smith [30M] is kind of a weird character. He is fun, in small doses. I am not annoyed with him so much as perplexed. He seems stuck in middle school. 

My wedding had a lot of small problems. I had a kid throw up on my dress, so I wore my MOH's dress while she changed into her street clothes. I tripped going up the stairs. Dan dropped his ring down the vent. One of my cousin's children knocked over a pile of cupcakes. For the most part, no one did anything on purpose and we have it on tape, which is hilarious. 

There was one incident that felt intentionally done to make my day harder for me. It was done by Smith. During the actual vows, when the priest [60sM] asked if anyone protests, forever hold your peace, Smith stood up. He said he was in love with me and didn't think I should marry his brother. Then after a few seconds of silence, he said 'wrong wedding' and walked out. I could hear him laughing about it. 

I have a little brother [25M] who was prone to stupid shit like this when he was 11. I have learned not to take it personally, I work with kids. I am used to Smith. I just felt it was stupid and made him look bad more than me. I didn't want it in the video and asked the videographer to take it out. I didn't bring it up again, I let Dan handle his family like we have agreed. I think he spoke to Smith about it, I know my MIL [60s] gave him a stern once over.

I let it go. I didn't really think about it much until we got the video and pictures. Smith was over while my cousin Cindy [40F] was. Cindy asked to see the video and pictures. I turned it on, showed her the video. It was hilarious. It was loving and beautiful. It also didn't have Smith doing something stupid. 

Smith got upset about it and said we kept all the other bad stuff, why not him. He was part of the wedding excitement. He was funny. Why didn't we keep it in? 

I told him I didn't think it was very funny, he did it to piss us off, and I didn't want it in my video. I said no hard feelings, it wasn't funny is all. 

Smith left and is actually upset about this. He has been texting Dan saying how I changed him, blah blah.

I am just not sure how to go forward from this. I feel like I am dealing with a toddler. How do I explain to Smith that he could have ruined my wedding, and most women would have flayed him alive and told him to never come into their home? I feel he owes me an apology, but don't really care that Smith thinks he is funny. I just don't want to deal with hissy fits. So what do I do? 


**TL;DR** BIL made a stupid joke during my wedding vows and is upset the guy edited it out. NOt sure what is up?

"My [18 M] girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months found out how much I make in a month. Now she expects me to spoil her regularly.


Okay Reddit, lately, I've been making pretty solid money at my job, and business has been booming in the area I oversee. I work my ass off, (9-5 laboring in the scalding western sun). My girlfriend is unemployed, but hasn't looked for a job since before we were even dating. I've addressed that issue with her many times, but she always shoots me down and plays the victim. 

Now, I do mobile banking with a relatively small bank in my city, all my expenses and gains are listed in the app, so it's all I use. The thing is, when you open the app, it requires you to enter your password before you can do anything. 

Cut to last week. I had just got to my apartment on payday after work, she came over and we were talking about our days, when I decided to check my bank account. She must've been looking over my shoulder and saw my password before I got into the shower, opened my phone without me giving her permission, and looked at my expenses. When I got out of the shower, she was furious. 

She went on a rant about how I never treat her or care for her (both exaggerations considering I take her out every week and buy her gifts regularly), and how I need to ""clean up my act"" if we are to stay together, because I ""make too much to not treat her like a goddamn queen"". She has never acted like this towards me, so I got very upset. We argued for a while, and after a few hours she stormed out of my apartment. 

I'm on my last leg here. My mind is telling me to leave, but she's genuinely nice and caring, something I've never really had in a relationship before. Help me, Reddit.


   
**tl;dr**: GF saw how much I make in a month, yelled at me for not spoiling her, and stormed out.

"[Update] Boyfriend [25M] and his sister-in-law [28F?] sneaked out to the beach at 3am.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mo80h/boyfriend_25m_and_his_sisterinlaw_28f_sneaked_out/

Hey again.

As much as I wanted to tell you all that it was over nothing, that they just wanted to get some air or smoke some weed or something, not the case. They were indeed fucking.

I asked my boyfriend about it. Didn't mention that I saw him go out with her, just that I saw him leave the bed and come back later. He told me that he just went to pee and then saw his dad in the kitchen who couldn't sleep and they had a chat for a while. Liar.

I asked his sister in law immediately after that, said that I saw her from the window for a second. Was I just imagining it since I was half sleep or did she go out ""alone"" that time of night? She said that she enjoys midnight breaths and alone walks on the beach. Liar again.

I told his brother that I saw them leave. He told me that they enjoy long walks on the beach. He couldn't be bothered to go with them. I thought liar.

So apparently they gave each other the heads up since my boyfriend came to me and told me everything an hour later. Him and his brother like sharing their girlfriends and SOs. He's been fucking his sister in law for years now. That night was just another moment. He told me that he wanted to tell me when the time is right or when he thought I'm prepared so that I can join in and sleep with his brother so they don't even need to sneak around.

He wasn't even admitting that it was cheating, saying that it doesn't count since it's his sister in law not some random girl. I don't even know what to say to that. He called me traditional for thinking it was cheating. Yeah. I consider having sex with anyone else cheating, call me traditional.

So I broke up with him and left him to deal with his weird shit with his brother and I'm actually happier now. The thought of what he was up to all those times grosses me out completely. He can fuck himself. We wanted to go on a holiday together, now I'm gonna go have fun with my cousins instead. 
   
**tl;dr**: They were fucking. His brother knew. It was their thing. They wanted me involved too. No way. We broke up. Fuck them all. "
"My [26M] girlfriend [25F] keeps breaking my shit


She breaks so much of my stuff it doesn't seem like an accident anymore. The day after I got my iPad Pro she broke it, she broke my phone twice, she dropped my laptop and dented it, she broke my other iPad, all since she moved in with me in February. Even putting the expensive stuff aside she breaks tons of other shit. For example I had all my wool sweaters in a special hamper that I told her to never wash the clothes in it so I can make sure they don't get ruined but sure enough she washed and dried them all and they all died. Even though sweaters aren't that expensive individually replacing them cost a ton of money. I kinda think she's doing it on purpose because she thinks it's cute, which would be my fault because when she broke my iPad Pro I told her it was cute how worried she got about telling me. She says she's just clumsy but I don't think that's what is happening. We've been together for almost two years and I've never noticed any clumsiness. 


I locked all my shit up in my office when I went to work the past few days since there was another incident and that upset her a lot because she thinks I can't trust her and I'm treating her like a child. Is it really so wrong to lock up my shit though? She wants to borrow my camera this weekend and I straight up told her no because I know she's going to break it. I'm not using it but I do wedding photography when I want to bring in some extra cash so having to buy another camera would really suck.

**tl;dr**: my SO is constantly breaking or ruining my shit and I think it's on purpose.  "

"UPDATE: My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends.


Original Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m6oij/my_friends_1920m_just_humiliated_me_19m_with_a/

Hey guys, I just want to thank you for all the support you've given me in regard to this, so I thought I'd share an update.

I approached T and paid him back for the dinner, and explained to him how while he thought it was ""banter""; he was just generally being unacceptably dickish, and how I wasn't going to take that. While I was initially fighting the urge to give him a slap; he was pretty apologetic. I'm not gonna lie; I thought he was being sincere.

I didn't forgive him or anything like that; but I didn't block him either. A few days went by and I went on with my life, working, uni, etc. However, this evening when I was hanging out at home, they (T and the other ""mates"" in that group) began bombarding my Facebook page with posts like ""food thief"", ""povo"" (Aus slang for poor) and other generally egregious shit, all geo-tagged with the restaurant that we went to. This took me slightly off guard as being unprovoked, but it seemed they were satisfied engaging in their little circle jerk.

Guess my mind was made up for me. Deleted the posts, blocked them, and am now just pondering where to find some more friends 😂

I also tried going back to the restaurant and explaining the situation; but they were having none of it. Turns out they recognised T from his soccer career and decided to take his word over mine. He hadn't clarified with them it was ""a prank"" either it would seem, so I guess I'm never going back to that place 😂
Not a particularly bright and sunny update; still poor, lost more mates than I'd initially thought I would, and I'm barred from the restaurant. They're not my only friends however, and at least they were kind enough to make my decision easier.

Once again I can't thank you enough; without your support and input I honestly don't know if I'd have realised how toxic these people were.

Much love.

Tl;dr - even more mates turned out to be assholes, and I won't be eating at the restaurant anymore. Life goes on though."
"[UPDATE] Me [37 M] with my wife [34 F] 12 years, my coworker tried to seduce me should I tell my wife.


https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iwhyu/me_37_m_with_my_wife_34_f_11_years_dont_know_if_i/

It says 12 years in the title because me and my wife just celebrated our 12 year anniversary. I took her on a nice dinner and we had a good time but you dont want to hear that romantic shit on with the update.


**Update**

So, where to begin after my post I decided to tell my wife after the kids were settled. I sat her down and I told her this woman had flirted with me in the past and has generally made me uncomfortable.

I told her I didn't reciprocate any attention or flirting but there was something i needs to tell her.

I told her she came into my office and was talking to me and then took off her clothes. (She asked if we did anything) and I said absolutely not and I would never cheat on her.

She then started laughing and said she must of wanted to make a porno with me. (She knows about the camera because she's brought me lunch before and saw it) we both laughed and she just told me she trusts me and is glad that she has a faithful husband.

She took it better than i thought but I was glad I got that off my chest but I still had stuff to do. I reported her the video was reviewed and long story short she was fired. (She gave me the evilest looking eye anybody has ever given me in my entire life)

I would like to say I talked out of there like a badass but I still had paper work so I had to work. But after I was done I felt better actually, this felt like a weight on my shoulder.

Side note for people who want to hear our romantic 12 year anniversary:

So, I knew our 12th anniversary was coming up so this is what I did for her. I tried hard to remember where our first date was and after looking at an old picture I saw the name.

I asked my sister if she could watch them and I took her out for a special night. We had fun and she was really happy and honestly I'm very happy with my life.

We tried uh.....getting busy but my daughter was being a turd and pushing into my wife's rib cage. She felt uncomfortable so we stopped and I'm kinda laughing thinking about. Cockblocked by my own daughter.

Well there's the update bye.
   
**tl;dr**: everything worked out in the end except I was cockblocked by my daughter."

"I (20F) tend to approach guys first and ask them out. My friends (all early 20sF) think it's wrong because I'm a girl and ""guys are supposed to make the first move"". Am I right in thinking that's bs?


Throwaway time 


I recently entered the dating scene again (after breaking up with my boyfriend of 2 years) and at first things were quite difficult. Although I'm seen as very attractive I never got approached by guys. They just tend to be really nervous and awkward in my presence. I constantly get male attention but no one ever actually comes up to me. I don't think I'm intimidating at all but maybe it seems that way. On the rare occasion I do get approached it's by arrogant douchebags and I hate it. 



I decided to make things easier for myself so I started to do the approaching. Usually guys are confused (several of them have asked me if I was pulling a prank lol) and act really strange but after a while they open up and things are really fun. If I really like the dude I tell him we can meet up at that time at that place. Things are going very well so far and I've met some really interesting people this way. 



So my friends know that I ask out guys (sometimes I do it when we're all together) and their response has been all negative. They say that it makes me look ""cheap"" and that guys don't like it when the girl is ""easy to get"". They're of the belief that men should always make the first move because it's apparently ""classier"" that way. They especially hate it when it's a good looking guy and say ""oh he's hot, he probably wants a girl to chase not a girl who throws herself at him"". First of all, I don't ""throw"" myself at anyone. I start a casual conversation and if I like the the person I ask for the number. Just because you're good looking it doesn't automatically mean I like you. Btw, I don't always ask out attractive guys either because looks are not the most important thing to me. It's fairly high on my list but I value other things more. For example I approached the guy I'm seeing now at a clothing store and he's not conventionally attractive but I like him a lot. In fact my friends said that I'm ""out of his league"" and that my standards are ""way too low"". They're just constantly negative and criticizing me. They weren't like this before. And you know what? They always complain about ""ugly"" guys approaching them and when I told them to maybe start making the first move they looked at me like I'm crazy. 



At first I ignored their comments but now I'm starting to doubt myself. Is it really unattractive if a girl approaches a guy first? I mean they don't seem to mind but deep down are they really thinking  ""jeez, there must be something wrong with her to come to me first"" ? Be honest with me. I've been told by several guys that they were shocked when I asked them out and that they find my confidence attractive but now I'm thinking that maybe they don't find it ""feminine"" or whatever. I guess I'm really interested in the male perspective as well so please give me some insight if you're a guy 


**TL;DR I approach guys first and my friends are saying that it makes me look cheap, it's not attractive, etc. Is there some truth to that?** 

EDIT: pretty overwhelmed by the response, I thank you all :) "
"My friends (19,20M) just humiliated me (19M) with a cruel joke and I'm questioning if they're really my friends.


Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset.

For some context, I'm living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can't go on benefits because my parents' income is too high, yet they won't offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene).

My friend, let's call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He's an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T).

T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I'm about to leave; he texts me and says that there's been a change of plan; that we're going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he'd love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can't afford it and that I'd catch up with them after. However; he begins to go ""oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X"" and insists that I come along; saying that he's shouting (paying for) the feed anyway.

After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I'll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal.

T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. ""Oh shit, I don't have my card with me"". He then goes on to show me that he's got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because ""you're up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal"". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I'll either have to dine and dash (which I'm not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I'm straight up fucked.

The whole time I'm trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn't have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there's an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they've paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can't pay for mine.

Manager comes up and says he'll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he'll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I've never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.)

So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of ""banter"" was.

I'm pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven't replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much.

Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming? This isn't the first joke at my expense and sadly I don't think it'll be the last.

Tl;dr - my rich friends publicly humiliated me for being broke, pls read the main text.

"My girlfriend [24F] of 1 year asked me [24M] for a $1000 loan. I said no.


My gf of 1 year asked me for a loan of $1000, I said no.

We've been together a year, we live separately though.  We each have our own apartments.

She currently doesn't have a job, although she claims to be looking for one.  She kind of has a hectic lifestyle, she spends a lot of money.  She goes out a lot, eats out a lot, buys many things she doesn't need such as expensive clothing, when she should be buying things more affordable.  She spends money on coffee at cafes every day.

She's borrowed money from her parents before and has never managed to pay them back, basically just squandered them.  Now its come to a point where even her parents refused to lend her money cause they know they'd be basically enabling her poor spending habits and they know they'd never see that money again.

Frankly, I feel the same. I feel if I lend it to her, its as good as gone.  I told her I feel there's a lot more she could do to save money, she could move out and live somewhere more affordable, she could intensify her job hunting and maybe work something that she might otherwise consider 'beneath her' until she makes enough money.  I mean, lots of restaurants always have spots available for waiters or kitchen staff, I don't see why she can't just pick up a minimum wage job for the time being instead of going out every day and going to clubs wasting her parents money.

I told her she could be better budgeting herself, i.e. on what she eats, what she wears, where she lives, how much she spends, and she wouldn't have as severe money problems.  She accused me of lecturing her and got angry, I told her she was the one who came to me for help with money.  She just wanted me to hand her over a $1000 to ""borrow"" which she'll definitely totes absolutely pay back (probably never).

I told her, honestly, I feel if I lend her the money, I don't think she'll be able to pay it back.  She told me she will, she has a plan, I should just trust her.  I also pointed out I don't like lending out money to family and friends because it causes a constraint on our relationship when they can't pay it back.

She was like ""oh but you lent $1000 to your sister in the past"".  I said yes, because then I knew I could trust her to properly budget herself, she had a job at the time, and I trusted her to be able to pay it back, which she did.

Its caused a lot of strain and resentment within our relationship, I'm really not sure what to do.  I don't want to pay her the money, I think she should make adjustments to her living style and stop living beyond her means.   The fact that her parents have now flat out refused to just hand her over money I think says a lot about their level of trust for her. Any advice on what I should do or how to handle this?

"Update! ""Would it be messed up for me [22f] to break up with my boyfriend [24m] of about a year in public?"" (answer: NOPE)


Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n3bon/would_it_be_messed_up_for_me_22f_to_break_up_with/

Hey beautiful people!

I wanted to update you guys because I got SO much excellent advice from people here and I wasn't able to reply to a lot of it because I was a little in my head at the time, so I wanted to be able to say THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you at once!

First of all, Greg and I are now officially broken up, and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off me. I am a LITTLE anxious about the possibility of him trying to get me back, but some of the stuff he said made me feel this isn't likely. (And for those of you who said to change my locks, etc. - he doesn't have a key to my place! But I am asking a friend to spend the night with me the next few nights just in case!)

So, what I ended up doing: I asked Greg to meet me earlier this afternoon at a park near his place. I sat on the edge of a fountain because it was a spot that was surrounded by people/had a lot of people looking towards it, but there was enough room that we could talk. I also had a guy friend of mine (Sam) sit off at a distance and asked him to keep an eye and he said he'd come over if anything went wrong or it looked like Greg was trying to hurt me or start a confrontation.

I planned out a whole explanation for Greg, including telling him that I wasn't going to reconsider but that I really thought he should get help for unaddressed issues from his childhood. He immediately said, ""I know. You're right. I'll get help. I've been wanting to get help for a while now."" To which I was like uh, no, you haven't, you've actually told me you think therapy is bullshit and refused to even discuss it, but good, get help. And then he said ""only if you stay with me,"" and I reiterated that wouldn't be happening.

He continued trying to talk me out of breaking up with him, like I knew he would, and made me sound really fucking crazy for thinking it was a good idea - he kept saying stuff like, ""you think it's abuse for me to hold your arms down when you're being a cunt and I don't know what crazy shit you're going to pull?"" (for the record, I have NEVER been violent to him, except in trying to get him away from me, and he has no reason to expect this from me)...and ""you just don't know what abuse is because you were spoiled"" and, when I would bring up specific instances, ""that never happened,"" ""you're making it sound so much worse than it was, I was just trying to de-escalate things,"" etc. - basically, giving up on telling me to stay and just trying to convince me I was making stuff up.

At some point, he got really tense and quiet and snide and he said ""really? You think that's abuse? You think this is abuse?"" and grabbed my arm really firmly and dug his nails in (I'm already getting bruises). I probably physically could have gotten away from him but I kind of felt like my brain shut down because it hurt more than what he's done in the past, and because it was kind of an unexpected perfect workaround for my plan...in that it probably didn't outwardly look like much (no one noticed) but still hurt.

He continued to basically go after everything he knows is a sore point for me...""you're just a spoiled bitch,"" ""you don't get it because the worst thing that's ever happened to you is that you regretted fucking someone"" (referring to a very traumatic forcible rape), ""you're a fat cunt anyway""...essentially, targeting everything that was an insecurity for me. I now see he's been doing that in our relationship for a long time in more subtle ways. He's very good at reading people's weaknesses and using them against people.

After he let go of me, I stood up and said ""NO"" (I couldn't really think straight) and started running towards Sam. Greg got up and tried to grab my arm and pull me back, and I stopped so he wouldn't yank my arm off. Sam saw this and came over and physically pulled him off me and told him it's over and he needs to leave me alone and walk away. Sam is a big, pretty intimidating-looking guy - a lot bigger than Greg, which was helpful here. Greg said ""fuck you both, she's got you believing her bullshit too,"" and then ""fuck you, you cunt, you don't deserve me,"" and walked away.

About an hour after that, he started texting me saying he was sorry, that he really wanted my help addressing his issues, that he knew exactly what he's done wrong and he can really acknowledge it now and change, that this was a breaking point for him and he felt so guilty for ""making me feel hurt,"" etc. (I should have blocked him earlier, but I was texting about where to meet up until he got there, and afterwards felt kind of shaken and forgot about it.) I blocked him on my phone and also on Facebook and Twitter. (You apparently can't really block people on gmail, only send their stuff to spam, but I did that too.)

I literally never want to see or hear from him again. I honestly thought I'd feel at least a little sad or guilty or ""what if""-y, but I'm not. I'm so happy to be done with him. After the way he spoke to me today, I can honestly say that I was just wrong about him. I thought he was a good person who just had issues, but he's not - he's a person who's 100% willing to hurt me in ways that no one should, and only apologetic about it when HE faces consequences. I think he genuinely lacks a capacity for empathy - it doesn't hurt him to see me cry or hear that I feel scared! It only hurts him to know that might mean he doesn't get to be with me anymore. Everything he said and did was completely focused on how HE felt and how HE was reacting to things.

So, yeah, I feel a lot of relief now - not only because he's gone, but because this affirmed to me once and for all that EVERYTHING I thought was true and I 100% did the right thing by breaking up with him. He's just not a good guy, and I tend to have a really hard time judging people so I always chalked it up to his past and the fact that he was mistreated by others, but at a certain point, I also think it just doesn't matter why someone is the way they are, especially if they don't care about changing it until it affects THEM.

I also came across this quote while I was researching yesterday that was from a social worker, who said women would tell her their husbands break things when they're angry but it's just because they're out of control and don't know what they're doing, and she would always ask them if their husbands ever break their own things, and the answer was always no - they only break their wives' things. And the social worker said, basically, this proves that they aren't out of control - they know exactly what they're doing and do it anyway. The way Greg acted today reminded me of this - he figured out a perfect way to hurt me even though we were in public, and exactly what to say to me, and he wasn't yelling or getting in my face or being obviously aggressive because he KNEW he couldn't and was actually in control of his behavior. He just hurt me (physically and emotionally) because he wanted to. Not because he had to.

Ok, sorry this is so long winded. I just really wanted to share with you guys because I feel surprisingly great right now and I honestly have no idea how that would have gone if I hadn't gotten advice from you all first, but I suspect it could have gotten pretty ugly.

**TL;DR** - broke up with Greg (and learned exactly how nasty he is) and feel FREE! THANK YOU!"
"Me [29M] and Fiancee [25F] are getting married in 3 Months. 2 somewhat close friends [29M's] are offended that I did not invite them to the wedding...After they didn't invite me to theirs.


**Edit** I spoke with Andy a few minutes ago.  He called to apologize and mentioned that he spoke to Liz and she was not at all surprised.  He said her exact response was ""we didn't them to our wedding. I'm not all that surprised, especially when he probably doesn't have large control over the guest list due to their culture.""  He said that while he's hurt, he understands and that maybe we can get together before or after and work something out.

**Edit 2** Spoke to Steve and Rachel.  This conversation did not go as well.  Rachel was very accusative and called me ""rude and inconsiderate"" to not invite them.  Steve then piled on and noted it was ""different"" in the case where they didn't invite me, since they had a much smaller wedding.  He was also surprised that I would hold a ""grudge"".

I let them speak for a few more minutes before I stopped them and explained to them very clearly that I am not in charge of the full guest list, and that this guest list is roughly half of the guest list we wanted.   On top of that, based on cultural norms and other issues, we had to give priority to a lot of other family and friends.  And that despite whatever they think is ""different"" about their situation.  I have the same problem they do, just on a larger scale.  I then pointed out that while I don't hold a grudge, yes I was offended that I wasn't invited, and yes, it hurt a lot that other friends and distant relatives were invited when I was the only one who stepped up to keep Steve off the streets for months.

I also pointed out that I found it tacky that they thought it appropriate to mention that I didn't give them a wedding gift (and completely disregarding the dinner).  I told them that while they were not explicitly invited, I was also not looking for them to provide me a gift, in line with common etiquette.  

Rachel was quiet for a few seconds and then she said, well.  Are we going to be invited to the wedding or are we done?

I very calmly stated that the core wedding ceremony and the main western style ceremony were at capacity and that we won't be adjusting the guest list.  In terms of the Pre-Wedding shower, and the more ethnic reception, we have some flexibility, but based on our discussion and the general rudeness and sense of condescension from both you and Steve, that no, I will not be extending an invitation.  The fact that you felt it appropriate to exclude me and Ellie from your celebrations but that you feel entitled and EXPECT us to invite you to ours without so much as a real apology...wow.   

Steve just said Really? and then hung up.

----------------------------------------------------

Based on the updates...i'm going to see what Andy has to say, I may end up inviting him and Liz since they both seem very conciliatory and understand my reasoning.  I'd be ok with stretching a bit to accommodate them.  

----------------------------------------------------

Hello Reddit, Throwaway since my friends also read Reddit. (Not Sure about this sub specifically).  Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text.

Anyways, Myself and my Fiancee, Ellie, have been seeing each other for about 3 years now.  It's been long distance, and it's been tough with Visa issues and all sorts of other problems to get her into the country.  We finally had the proper statuses granted, and she's finally getting here so we can get hitched ^_^.   Sufficed to say, we're both super relieved that we no longer have to fly halfway around the world every month or 2 to see each other.


We've been planning the wedding, and it's going down in a few months and everyone is super excited since it's a multi-day blow out event (due to my culture), something like 1200 people over 3 days with 350 people at the actual wedding, and 400 people at 2 separate receptions due to the volume of people.  I'll talk more about this a bit later and why the numbers are ridiculous like this and I think some overlap at a pre-wedding shower that happens the day before.


Anyways, most of you know long distance is hard, things progress slower, things fall apart faster, so it takes A LOT of work to make them last.   And while I know it's an excuse, I was sort of OK with my friendships weakening because of my love for Ellie.   She ran into a similar problem due to the time commitments involved in the timezone differences and traveling (we'd alternate 1 month me, 1 month her, 1 month both of us got to some destination).  On top of that, I'd usually have to travel for a week or more for work a month.


Enter my 2 friends and their wives, Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz (same age as me).    We've been friends since elementary school and while we went to separate colleges, we kept in touch and we all stayed in pretty close contact over the years.   We're not super ultra close friends, but we'd usually hang out once or twice a month and for big events over the past decade...until 3 years ago.  Since my GF at the time lived far away, and I was traveling a lot for work and to see Ellie we all didn't hang out as often.  In all fairness a chunk of it falls on me since I flaked out a few times (though they did a number of times too the few times we were able to plan things).   We ended up only seeing each other once or twice a quarter.  I knew Rachel and Liz for quite some time as well including the full duration of both their relationships with my friends (and we were friends as well).  Steve actually lived with me for about 6 months after he lost his job due to burn out and I let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  He actually met Rachel during this time and I covered for the fact that he was unemployed and homeless (he's since told her and it's a funny story in our group).


My friends during this time met Ellie maybe once or twice...since our trips weren't long, we'd spend time in each other's company or go do tourist things / meet family, and friends if there was applicable time.  Steve and  Rachel got married 2 years, they threw a smaller wedding about 150 people.  We spoke and they talked about the engagement and everything, but I wasn't really posted on the wedding details.  I found out about the wedding when I had made plans with a friend, Paul, and he was like ""oh dude, we can't that day, it's Steve's wedding...don't you remember?""   I was a bit dumbfounded and responded with ""oh...I actually didn't know...I wasn't invited.""


Cue the next day when Steve calls me and to apologize and say that he got an earful from Paul about me not being invited and not even being invited to the bachelor party and that he'd like to extend and invitation to me to attend the bachelor party but unfortunately that they are at capacity for the wedding and that ""you understand how these things go, we have to cut people all the time. Sorry bro.""  I tell him thanks for the thought, but that I politely decline, and wish him the best and that I'll catch up with him and Rachel after the wedding.  I was pretty hurt though.  A few weeks later, Ellie was in town, so Steve, Rachel, Ellie and I all went to a really fancy dinner, and I covered it as a simple wedding gift to them (more on this later).


A few months later, Andy and Liz get engaged, and I make a joke about hopefully Ellie and I can attend this wedding since we we weren't able to come to the last one (we didn't mention to Andy that Steve didn't invite us).  Lo and behold about 2 months later, Andy calls me and says that ""I tried very hard but we can't get enough people to the wedding, and that it's a relatively small affair (200 people total) and that with family and others, we can't spare space at the ceremony or reception for myself or Ellie. Liz and I want to invite you both out to dinner before and after the wedding.""   I politely say thank you and that I hope they enjoy the ceremony.  I'm again, pretty hurt but don't want them to feel bad.


Enter a few months ago, Ellie and I are traveling in Europe and it just felt right so I put together an impromptu proposal and we got engaged in Paris.   We had talked about it a few times before hand and I was fairly certain she would say yes, and the moment really really just felt right so I proposed with a costume ring I had stealthily bought while we were shopping.  NONE of my friends knew until we announced it on our return...again, I hadn't really planned the proposal, so it wasn't something we announced ahead of time to have a big show about.   We didn't make a big announcement in general, just a number of close friends and family.  


Anyways, enter my family.   Ellie and I are of different cultures and ethnicities.  My parents are usually very conservative and I had suspected some blowback from them when I brought an ""outsider"" in.  We were expecting them to want to keep it relatively quiet and small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised that they were super super excited that I was FINALLYYYYYYY getting married and was choosing to settle down.  My mom has had grandchild fever for a few years now...They also absolutely adore and love Ellie.  According to my mom, ""in this day and age, it's hard to find a woman who is both independent and successful in their career, but also able to cook, clean and maintain a household""...tad sexist I know, but that's how my mom is, I think she's just happy that she has someone she can cook with and share recipes with and all the daughter stuff she's been wanting to do in a house full of 2 boys and a husband.


Anyways, my parents offered to help with the wedding...A LOT.   In my culture, it's sort of ridiculous how extravagant the weddings can be.   The guest list is out of control in some respects, but in my culture it's offensive to not invite people to your wedding who have invited you to their wedding.  Additionally, weddings are huge family affairs so this includes folks from years ago and my parents and her parents friends who all get invited, with families in tow.  Ellie and I already planned a much smaller get together with a number of people about a week before the wedding to ensure that we get quality time with our close friends at a mini-reception.  Most of these friends are also invited to the main wedding, everyone understood.  This mini-reception is 50 people and being held on mine and Ellie's dime. We did not invite Steve, Rachel, Andy or Liz to any of the events.  Honestly, I just forgot, maybe a bit bitter...but in all honesty when listing out all the names and families and seating arrangements, our eyes just kind of gloss over.   Our parents both opted to cover 80% of the wedding to accommodate all the cultural norms and to ensure they can invite extended family and friends  We are covering the remaining 20% + honeymoon as well.  While stressful, our parents have been super understanding and helpful in the planning, so Ellie and I are OK with going with the flow.


Anyways, Myself and a lot of friends were out last night having a night on the town, including Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz.  Ellie is currently in her home country sorting out her affairs in prep for the final move over to the states.   We're all a bit drunk and Rachel asked when the invites for our wedding were going out.  Without thinking, I blurted out, oh we sent those out months ago.  Another friend chimed in saying ""mannnnnn, I can't even begin to comprehend how insane it is to handle that many people at your wedding, you must be going insane, what's the guest list at...like 1500?""  Again not paying attention, i was like nooooooo closer to 1200 at which point I saw Rachel's eyes bug out and my sanity kicked in and we all changed the subject.


This morning, Steve lights up my phone with a ""dude, did you seriously not invite us to your wedding?  Rachel is super upset that you didn't invite us, and after you didn't even get us a wedding gift"".  Andy called a few hours later with a ""I thought we were closer than that? You have a HUGE wedding and you couldn't invite us? That hurts...""  We talked for a few minutes and I mentioned I was out running errands and that I would talk to him later. Same with Steve.


Honestly, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for NOT inviting them.  It sucks, but it is also somewhat offensive that they feel entitled to attend my wedding or claim that I didn't give t hem a wedding gift...when I was not invited, and STILL took them out to expensive and fancy dinner's (100+ a head) to celebrate.


I would like to not damage the relationships as much as possible, but at the same time I'm trying to find out how to approach them properly with why I didn't invite them.


   
**tl;dr**: Didn't invite 2 pairs of close friends to my wedding because they did not invite me to theirs.  In my culture not inviting someone to your wedding can be seen as a huge and deeply personal slight.   They claimed capacity issues, in my case, we already have 1200 people coming across multiple events (precisely to avoid this cultural slight).  How do I explain this to them while properly explaining how hurt I was during their weddings?"
"My sister [20F] described to me a really weird and threatening encounter she had with my [18M] girlfriend [18F] of 6 months. I asked my girlfriend about it, she said it was just a ""joke"", but my sister is genuinely disturbed.


Like the title says, been together for 6 months.  She was at our house the other day, and my sister tells me this is what happened.

Apparently in the corridors upstairs, my girlfriend ambushed my sister and pretty much cornered her and started interrogating her.  From what my sister told me, she was saying ""back off, he's mine now, not yours"" ""he doesn't love you like he loves me""  ""you don't understand him like I do"" ""you'll never be able to please him the way I do, so just back off"" ""stay out of our way"" ""I don't care if you love him, he's mine"" ""I know what you two do, back off, he's mine now"" ""whatever you think you two have, its nothing compared to what me and him have"" and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember.

Apparently it was in a very aggressive and threatening manner, my sister said she was really scared, and felt totally threatened and creeped out.

I asked my girlfriend about it, she said it was just a joke and asked if my sister found it funny. I said no, she was really disturbed, she just said ""oh well"".

I'm genuinely scared.  I know my girlfriend can be a bit possessive and clingy at times, but its always kind of cute, never this creepy.  She can get a bit nasty and angry at other girls who get too ""close"" but this shit is way too far.  Does she have a mental illness? Is she crazy?  Should I just run or can I work with this?  How can I reassure my sister that she's safe cause she's kinda freaked out.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend threatened and cornered my sister, played it off as a ""joke"".  Sister genuinely creeped out."
"I (25F) shaved my head in solidarity/support of my sister (21F). My friend (25?F) has taken it upon herself to hijack the situation and is trying to make this into a social media frenzy.


Throwaway because.. well just cause. 

My younger sister 2 years ago was sick. She did not get better. She has cancer and the prognosis is good (not fabulous but good). For the record this is all I am going to say about my sisters condition. Thank you for understanding.

Couple of weeks ago she (my sister) started to lose her hair. Her bf freaked out, it prompted him to leave and it was a totally shitty time. She decided to shave it off earlier this week but she did it alone when she was vulnerable and instead of feeling empowered and in control it left her devasted and worse than ever.

Whilst she was crying in my dad's arms, I left the house walked to the nearest barber shop and came back 45 minutes later (yeah I had a bit of a cry too) to show her that her hair is definitely not what makes her beautiful and that I really am with her. 

I did not do a big selfie of side by side picture or ""if you share this 50k times then she will be cured"" bs on social media because I'm not interested and she would definitely not be down for it. Definitely not. 

My pal, Emma, I went to University with. I graduated 3 years ago and our relationship was close friends at the time but now.. more like friendly Facebook friends. 

I suppose my haircut was more gossip material than I realised because even without posting a picture a lot of people sent me messages saying messages for my sister and for me saying how brave I was- they were kind and I'm not going to get angry at them because it's true. I did shave my head. The world is gonna know sooner or later!

But Emma tagged me in a picture this week and she has shaved her head. In support of my sister who she has never met. This makes me very uncomfortable. I used to think she was quite.. well rather selfish and liked being in the spotlight and this only reinforces this image of her. I'm just frustrated because she has included a message of ""share to support bald sisterhood sister in this time"" and it's like.  Er. Okay? 

My sister saw it and laughed. She goes on Facebook maybe 6 times a year. She has bigger things to worry about like I dunno - cancer. 

I sent Emma a message thanking her for her kind words and gesture, it was rather left field but that it was nice to know strangers cared.

It's escalated enormously in the last 2 days. She has started a Facebook group, she shares pictures of her posing with her new hairstyle  (at times not evening mentioning my family or any cancer patient struggles at all) multiple times a day and I honestly think she's going to start asking for money. 

I sent her a message essentially saying ""okay.. enough is enough. Let's not forget that my sister is the patient here. I would like this to remain a private family matter. Please stop tagging me in your photos and stop this Facebook group and asking for shares"" amongst other things like it was a sweet gesture but I had worried it had snowballed.. I put it nicely!

She saw the message and its got worse. She just posted a picture that got 4k+ shares and comments and like I said no mention of me. But without that mention.. this is going to sound crazy but I think she's trying to slowly make it look like she has cancer or is sick. 

I need to stop this. Neither my sister or my family want or need this. What do you think I should do? I feel good writing this out. Thanks reddit.

TL;DR : Little sister has cancer. I shaved my head in support. Friend who does not know sister shaved hers also in support. She is now sharing pics of herself which I think imply she has cancer."
"Me [33M] found out my wife [32F] of 10 years cheated on me with my best friend 9 years ago from his wife who just found out herself


[removed]"
"UPDATE: My [30F] sister [38F] is suddenly mad at me because her daughter [7F] likes the nickname I gave her more than her real name.


The original post is [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4miqyj/my_30f_sister_38f_is_suddenly_mad_at_me_because/)

First, I want to thank everybody for their suggestions and opinions in my original post. They really helped me tangle with some difficult issues that had been on my mind for a week.

Second, I feel the need to direct attention to this comment thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4miqyj/my_30f_sister_38f_is_suddenly_mad_at_me_because/d3w75uc. I didn't go too in to detail about my sister's narcissism and how she tends to behave around Jordan because I didn't want to make the post too long. I should have been more clear.

And somebody asked where Jordan's father is. He works night shift six days a week, so he makes my niece dinner before he goes to work, then packs her lunch and sends her off to school in the morning when he gets home. They go to church with his family once or twice a month and they like to garden together. I don't talk to him a lot because he's usually sleeping during the day and I don't go to their house very much.

This update is going to need some back story that I should make clear from the start for a change. Jordan's father is black, and his family is very religious and very in to representing their culture and heritage. The church does a lot of spirituals, and his family likes singing them at home, too. Jordan loves them, her favorite is ""Go Down Moses."" She also likes a lot of songs from old musicals we watch togther, like Porgy and Bess and Show Boat, that reference the struggles of slavery. When she was about 4 or 5, my sister realized she loved those songs and would always sing them, and she tried telling her husband that Jordan was not allowed to listen to ""that type of music,"" or watch movies about slavery or read books about it, because my sister ""wasn't raised that way."" My brother in law is usually really passive, but this was one moment where he stood up to my sister and told her that their daughter is half-black and can trace her heritage back to the plantations, so ignoring her heritage wasn't going to happen. My sister will regularly pick this fight with her husband when Jordan starts liking something from African American culture that my sister doesn't like. (But if it's something my sister does like, like a Beyonce song? No complaints.)

After my sister yelled at me at the picnic (it was last Saturday, I'm sorry I wasn't clear), I didn't watch Jordan for a few days, partly because I was busy and partly because I thought I should give my sister some space. This was easy because it's summer and I'm not taking Jordan home from school right now. She spent a lot of time with my mother and her other grandmother instead. Shortly after I posted my original post, I sent my sister a few text messages to see how she was doing and what she'd been up to, and she sent back, ""Don't think I don't know what you're up. I haven't changed my mind about that stupid name."" I told her that was fine, she was Jordan's mother and I'd respect her wishes. She sent another message saying, ""Her name is Jordan, nothing else, because that's what I named her."" That text becomes relevant later.

Her other grandmother actually dropped Jordan off at my house this morning, and she said something like, ""Hey, Beezy, tell your aunt all about the bugs you found!"" I was so shocked to hear that name after it had been supposedly banned. My niece told me all about the grasshoppers she'd caught and everything, and then she ran to the back bedroom to get something. I asked her grandmother if my sister had spoken to her about her nickname and reminded her about the picnic, and she was like, ""Oh, she was serious about that? That doesn't make sense, we've been calling her Beezy all week, right in front of her mom, too."" I asked her what my sister had been calling her, and she gave me a weird look and said, ""Beezy and JP, like usual. Why?""

Before she left, my sister's mother in law mentioned that my sister had yelled at her this past week, too. Apparently, MIL and Jordan had been watching TV at my sister's house, and a black woman with corn rows came on screen. Jordan told her grandmother she loved her hair, MIL said her cousin could do her hair like that if she wanted, my sister got angry and said there was no way her hair was getting put in corn rows. MIL asked what was wrong, and my sister said she didn't know how to take care of corn rows, so it wasn't happening. MIL told her her son (my sister's husband) used to have corn rows and knew all about them, and she could teach my sister about how to take care of them. Then my sister said, ""Well, I don't like how they look."" Jordan said, ""Aunt Bebe has hair like that and she looks really pretty. Don't you think I'd look pretty?"" Apparently, my sister just said ""No, and don't you do her hair like that, it's hideous"" (you being the grandmother and her family). Jordan's grandmother said she didn't push the issue because she's not the girl's mother, but she knew it hurt Jordan's feelings, and she was pretty upset about it as well.

As soon as Jordan's grandmother left, I texted my sister and said, ""I'm only to call her Jordan, right?""

""Right.""

Well fuck. I was furious, but a few users made a good point. Living with a narcissistic parent is never easy. My niece and I are close and I don't want our relationship cut off. So I need to pick my battles. So once Jordan was all played out and relaxed, I said, ""Honey, we need to have a talk about your name. Mommy really wants me to call you Jordan, and I think it's important that we do what she says.""

My niece got really upset and said that wasn't fair, her mom called her Beezy herself and everybody else did, all of her friends call her Beezy, the name is special to her, she loves fairies and it's always reminded her of fairies (that got me right in the gut), she hates the name Jordan, it was a real mess. So finally I said, ""Well, what would happen if I stopped calling you Beezy?"" She said names like that are magical and special, so if I stopped calling her Beezy, she wouldn't be special or magical anymore.

I told her she's special no matter what, but she was still upset. I was scrambling for a minute and then I realized, well, if she wants her name to be magical, we can do that. I asked her if she wanted to make Jordan special, too. When she eventually agreed, we listened to some of her favorite songs that mention the River Jordan, and I said, ""See? Jordan is really special in these songs!"" That did the trick. She was thrilled. I think I heard Old Man River a dozen times, but it was worth it. Victory! I figured we were all done with this. I could safely call her Jordan, the battle was avoided, so on and so on.

Of course not. An hour ago I got a visit from a very pissed off sister. Apparently, Jordan told her mom all about the songs and how her name was special because of them, and *now my sister is telling me I can't call her Jordan.* I asked her why, and she said something like, ""She likes the name now because of those black people songs! I fucking hate that music!""

I said, ""I'm really sorry, but Jordan loves it, and it was the only way I could get her to accept me calling her Jordan instead of Beezy.""

She kept ranting on about how that was too bad, she hated that music, she wasn't raised with black culture, etc. At no point did she mention my niece's feelings. I finally asked her, if I can't call her the name she wants to be called and I can't call her her birth name, what am I supposed to call her? And she just stared at me, completely blank, for I don't know how long, and then she said in a real nasty voice, ""Just call her whatever you want, then."" Five minutes later, she's totally calm and asking me to watch my niece again in a few days so she can go shopping. And by the way, she called her Beezy almost the whole time she was there. It was bizarre.

I was a wreck about this comment at the picnic for almost a week and now things seem much more clear. For me, this confirms that the problem wasn't ""Beezy"" at all. My sister is picking fights like this because she's a first class narcissist. She is jealous that her daughter has a good relationship with other people, and she's mad that her daughter is becoming her own person. Jordan likes something her mom doesn't like? PISSED OFF. Picking a fight with the adults around makes her feel like she's in control of Jordan again, but doesn't directly come off as abusing or yelling at her daughter. When I look back, this fits a real pattern of behavior for her. The good thing (I don't know what else to call it) is that my sister will rarely watch her daughter for more than one full day at a stretch before she gets frustrated or bored, so I know she won't cut me off. She depends on me too much for child care. I'm just going to try and be there for Jordan as much as I can, and I won't say it out loud, but when she turns 18, she's welcome to move in with me. She can move in with corn rows and a Beezy name tag while she sings ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"" at the top of her fucking lungs. That feels like the right thing to do.



   
**tl;dr**: Jordan's grandmother revealed that everyone (including my sister) has been calling her Beezy and JP all week without any problems. Got my niece to accept the name Jordan and my sister picked a fight. Now realizing my sister picks fights to feel like she's in control of her daughter. I will allow my niece to move in with me if she wants when she turns 18."

"My girlfriend [23F] is raging angry because I [23M] slept with someone else when I thought we were broken up.


My girlfriend and I have been together as boyfriend and girlfriend since we were 15, 8 years now.  We were both the first people we'd ever slept with and have been together since then.

Since we kind of matured together along with our relationship, it was basically a high school romance that turned into a real serious relationship.

We were out for dinner on a date last weekend, and we started talking about things and about marriage.  I told her what I'd said before, that I don't really want marriage, at least not now, its not a thing for me. If I do go down that way, I'd at least want it in my thirties.  She started insisting that what she wants is a marriage and she wants it now or at least a promise that it will happen soon. I told her I couldn't promise that, its not for me, its not something I want.  She accused me of being selfish and we got into a big fight and argument.

I then got a text from my sister that my dad was in hospital; I told my girlfriend  I had to go.  She wanted to resolve the marriage thing now and for me to say I'll commit to a marriage some day now, I told her no I couldn't do that, and I had to go now it was urgent.  She said if you leave now, we're through, I told her sorry I had to go.  She was crying and very angry and the whole night was ruined but I had to go to the hospital to see my dad.

I got there and things weren't that serious, he was being discharged shortly after I got there, everything was fine.  I tried to call my girlfriend, she wouldn't answer.

Next morning I tried to call her again, but then I got some texts from her saying we're through and she never wants to see me again, our relationship is over, she doesn't want to have anything to do with me, we're done.  I called her and she answered this time and she pretty much reiterated what she said.

I was devastated and in a state of shock, I was really miserable.  I went to my friends house and my friends were comforting me, telling me everything's okay, I'm better off without her, I don't need her, she's not worth my time.  They told me they were gonna take me out and were gonna make sure I had a good time and could forget about her.  We ended up going to some bars and clubs, but I didn't really have it in me to hit on any girls, but I ended up sleeping with one of the female friends that had gone out with us.  The next morning I thanked her and all that and we said it was just a one night thing, we wouldn't let it impact our friendship.

Things were going okay for 2 days when I got another call from my girlfriend, we talked a bit and said she was sorry for our fight and for her shouting at me.  She said she didn't mean it when she said we were done, she was just caught up in the moment and was angry, she expected that I would have gotten that.  So our relationship resumed.

The next day after that I decided to open up to her about what happened on the day we talked on the phone and how I had slept with my female friend that day.  She was devastated and started crying, shouting at me.  She accused me of cheating and being an asshole, I told her I did nothing wrong I thought we were broken up, she said I should have known we weren't, as if I am supposed to somehow read her mind.

She's been basically trying to guilt me this entire time and has told me I HAVE to give up that close circle of friends I went out with that day, I told her I can't do that, but she's insisting on it.  She keeps saying ""you're the one who cheated, not me"" and keeps questioning if she can be with me after I cheated, even though its ridiculous to say that I cheated.

Am I in the wrong here? Is she right in saying I cheated and I'm an asshole? Or is she just being crazy and I should not get back with her? Or should I agree to what she's saying and try to make things work?



   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend broke up with me, I slept with someone else, she said she didn't ""really"" break up with me, she was just angry. Is angry at me and calling me a cheater. "
"My [17M] mom [35F] married my girlfriend's [17F] dad [39M]. Now friends say it's weird that we're step siblings and dating. WTF?


My friend Jill and I have been best friends since we were 11 and my mom knew her dad from back then. Two years ago Jill and I started dating and honestly it's been wonderful for us. What we didn't know was that my mom was also secretly dating her dad for a year before we started dating.

We learned that they were dating about 18 months ago, six months after we started dating. About a year ago my mom talked to me about how I'd feel if she was to get married to Jill'd dad. I liked the idea since Jill'd dad is a great person and in some ways a role model for me. Jill also felt the same way about my mother. They married 9 months ago.

About six months ago we moved into our new house. This ones is much larger than the one that we used to have and our parents were very kind since they gave me and Jill our own master bedroom with a king size bed and our own bathroom. This has been very good for us (you bet). About the same time they had a talk to us about how we'd feel if they wanted to have a child, and Jill and I were very supportive. They plan to have two and very quickly since my mom is 35. My mom is now three months pregnant and we're looking forward to have little siblings.

That's basically our family now. Everything is perfect at home. But not with friends.

People keep telling us how weird this is. Our friends say they feel very uncomfortable coming to our place. The same with the parents. We keep hearing ""is it true you're step siblings and dating? Jesus"". And no matter how we tell them that we were dating and then we became step-siblings, they tell us that it's still wrong and weird and incest. This whole thing has increased since my mom has become pregnant.

I don't think there's anything wrong with me and Jill being together. Or with my mom and Jill's dad being together. It's not like Jill and I grew up being siblings. I know it can get a little unorthodoxies when the kids are born. I will be their brother, Jill will be their sister and we'll be dating but I don't think it will be a big deal at all.

This whole thing is bothering me and Jill and is affecting our social life and our relationship with our friends. We don't know what to do except telling our friends to not talk about it, but they don't listen.
   
**tl;dr**: my girlfriend's dad and my mom are married together now and my mom is pregnant. People find it weird. Friends and their parents included. It's bothering us and we don't know what to do with our friends."
"UDPATE:My [26F] ex [26M] wants another chance after abandoning me and our son [2m] for his culture


original: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jp2sx/my_26f_ex_bf_26m_wants_a_second_chance_after/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Tl;Dr of my original post: My ex boyfriend refused to introduce me to Indian his family because I am black, once he did, I found out they were racists that would never accept me or our son. When his father died, my ex boyfriend was guilted into leaving us. He came back claiming it was all a mistake and wanted a second chance. 

Ok, now on to the update. 

Hello again everyone! I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and kind words from my last post. It seemed that the consensus was that Raj was using his culture as an excuse to be a coward and not to trust him or take him back. Many also suggested that I talk to a lawyer to get sole custody of my son and get child support ironed out. So the day I posted, it was a day or two after Raj had just showed up. I was shocked to say the least and my mind was everywhere. The next day, Raj showed up again, with my knowledge this time, to discuss a few things. I had dropped my son off at my best friend's house for the time being so that we could talk with no interruptions. The conversation went well. I made it clear that for the foreseeable future, we will not be getting back together. I made sure he knew that I did not trust him and that at the moment, I didn't even like who he was as person. He asked if I still loved him and I answered honestly that I did, but at this point in time, it didn't matter. He didn't really remark on that, but seemed to take it at face value. He said that he understood why we couldn't be together but that he'd wait for me to be ready again. I told him not to hold his breath and that he needed to focus on being father and not a boyfriend. Which brings me to the next and most important part of the conversation. I told him that, again, for the foreseeable future, he would only be having supervised visits with our son under my discretion. We would be meeting at a specific place at a specific time and if he missed one meeting, then all bets were off. I also did not want my son to be in contact with anyone from his family. He agreed to all of that with a minor caveat to the last part. He said that when he left his family and cut contact with them, that his sister left too (the same sister that was at the dinner and looked to be sympathetic to me and my son). Apparently she realized what was happening was wrong and decided to take a stand. I was weary of his sister and told him that I'd have to meet her and speak with her a few times before I was comfortable with her being around my son. I informed Raj that I was going to see a lawyer to talk about custody and child support. He said ultimately, like in a few years, he'd like close to fifty fifty time, but for now he'd go with whatever I wanted. He also threw out a number for child support, more than what I was thinking, and we agreed to that number. Of course we will get this all legally taken care of because his word is shit. At the end of the conversation, I suggested he go and see someone about his family issues and the guilt he feels and he mentioned he had already looked into it. I'm not sure if that meant he has been going or what, but as of right now, I'm not going to push. 

So that initial conversation was great. I went and saw a lawyer and he said with our history, I would have no problem getting everything I asked for, especially since Raj isn't putting up a fight. We have an appointment with a mediator in the next few weeks to make it all legally binding. Ever since he's been back, Raj has been calling everyday to talk to our son. A few days after our second conversation, he brought a check for the back child support, something I hadn't yet asked for nor was expecting so quickly. He has been showing up for all of our meet-ups, early at that, and spends the entire with our son and not trying to get back with me. That was something I was worried about, but he's been trying to prove he can be a father. Before he left, I would've said he was an excellent, hands on dad and it looks like that guy is coming back. But again, it's only been like three weeks. I'll be more confident once he's been consistent for 6 months, a year, two years.

Yesterday I met with him and his sister without my son and she seems like a nice person. She was really apologetic and even cried. Apparently on top of thinking it was wrong the way his parents acted, she's a lesbian and her orientation is frowned upon by their mother. As an aside, I don't want anyone to think all Indian people are racist homophobes (especially since a lot of people of the same or similar culture were commenting on my last post saying they'd experienced something similar), but Raj's family are some seriously judgmental people. Together, they tried to show me proof that they had cut off their family. They showed me unanswered text messages, played me angry voicemails that weren't in English, but they sounded mad and Raj translated. He showed me an email that his mother sent that was in English basically telling him that if he came back now and married the girl they had lined up for him, all would be forgiven. But if he didn't, he was disowned and they would never talk to him again. His reply to that was that he was with his family and that he was not going to leave us again. It seemed to be legit, but I'm skeptical. Nothing but time will fix that. 

So there you have it. Raj is being a father, we are not getting back together anytime soon, if at all, and he has cut off his family for good (hopefully). I know many said that I shouldn't have even given him another chance to be in our son's life, but making that decision would not have been fair to my son. Raj knows this is his last chance and that he better not fuck up. 

**tl;dr**: Raj and I are not getting back together, but he is involved in our child's life. I went and saw a lawyer and things are getting straightened out. We are taking things slow as far as a friendship and I'm still leery. 

P.S- For shame, I fucked up on the title and it's in all caps. Sigh, lol. "
"Me [29F] feel like I am at the bottom of my fiance's 3 years [29M] priority list after I paid off his $80,000 debt.


[removed]"
"A ""friend"" [25 F] has been brigading my [24F] business.


Throwaway as I don't want this attached to my professional account. 


I'm a make up blogger, make up artist, and how to make up youtube artist. Basically, make up is my livelihood. It's been a wonderful part of my life and because my dad was a make up artist in a well known play district it's kind of a cool ""passing the torch"" thing. I make a majority of my living from make overs, personal consultations, and occasionally helping out my dad. I'm fairly confident in my skills and have great reviews on my webpages.... until Tuesday of this week. 



My boyfriend (Fred) has a group of friends that I've since joined and come to love. Recently one of his old high school classmates (Carrie) reintroduced herself to the group and has been going out with us. Two weeks ago we all decided to go hipster hopping. We basically switch between going to a bunch of super hipster bars or late night coffee places. My boyfriends younger sister was joining us and was a hanging out with me at my place while I was getting ready. She asked me if I'd help her with her eyeliner and I obliged, I also spruced up her look a little (with her permission) and gave her tips and how tos. She's the same skin tone as me and already had most of her make up on so it didn't bother me to spend fifteen minutes helping her a little. 


We went out and everyone had a great time. Boyfriends little sister received tons of compliments on her make up, and was hit on a little more than usual. She made an offhand comment about how I should always do her make up and how grateful she was. Nothing else really came up about make up aside from me complaining once about a birthday-zilla sweet sixteen girl I worked on a week or two ago.


The next day Carrie messaged me and asked me if I'd give her a full make over for a wedding coming up. I told her I'd be happy to give her a few pointers specific to her skin tone, face shape, and so on... or if she ever happened to find herself getting ready at my place I could help her with something like eyeshadow or contouring... However I told her that if she was interested in a full make over my rate for friends and family is X. I charge simply because I genuinely do a full makeover, complete with going to Sephora, MAC, and other stores to purchase make up that better matches their skin tone, easy to use so on, thats included in the price so they may keep their own make up. I've done this with wedding parties, with sorority formal parties, with sweet sixteeners and who ever else hires me for make overs. I feel that way at least you keep the make up I use on you. I only charge friends and family a flat rate as opposed to a flat rate and hourly charge that I normally charge. If someone has all the make up and tools they need then I just charge an hourly or a small fee for friends and family.


Carrie tried to barter and even brought up that I did boyfriends sisters make up. I informed her that I charge this just to cover the cost of make up, if she had her own and needed help with certain aspects I wouldn't mind helping but full make over is full make over. 


During the week we decided to go out to a reading from an author I love and all met up at my place. Carrie was very late and when she showed up she wasn't ready and she had brought her make up bag. I hoped to goodness that she just misinterpreted my message about getting ready in my home as at this moment we were running late and needed to speed to get to the reading on time. I said something along the lines of being ready to go, and she told me that she thought I was going to do her make up. I told her that we had to leave now and that wasn't enough time for me to do her make up. She became very irate and said that she didn't wear make up because I was going to do it and that she needed it done or wouldn't go out. 


I told her that I couldn't do her make up at this moment as we needed to leave now. She threw her make up back on the ground and yelled that I have to do her make up, she didn't wear any. One of the bottles in her bag broke and foundation splattered across my floor, other things just scattered. I've never felt so aggravated with someone before. So I listed the following reasons as to why this was not a good time and very inappropriate of her.


* She was 20 minutes late. If she had arrived 20 to 30 minutes earlier I might have been more receptive to helping

* She was already aware that I don't do full make overs without a charge as they can be time consuming...something we don't have any of

* This is one of my favorite authors, she knew this as I had excitedly posted in the group message and even commented on how she liked one of his other novels, so I felt her acting out like this was a little selfish

* I hate to be Larry David, but, that scene where he asks the off duty doctor to look at his rash and the doctor responds by asking him to write something for him off duty is just how I felt. I like make up and make a living from it, but I don't want to sit around doing make up all the time.



Carrie just turned around and left. She didn't collect her make up items, just left. Our friends apologized and said that even in high school she could be a little pushy to get what she wanted. We left and were able to make the last 10 minutes of the reading. It wasn't what I wanted and I spent the entire time with a sour taste on my tongue. 


That night Carrie texted me and told me that now I owe her a makeover (day of the wedding she's going to) for how I treated her and for stealing all of her make up. I refused and told her that she threw her make up bag on the ground and I would give it to a friend to give to her. I told her to not expect help like that from someone who she treats so terribly. She responded that I'd regret my decision and that's it. For a while I felt on edge but things wound down through past weekend and I felt better. I woke up tuesday morning to a lot more notifications on my social media pages than usual. 


Carrie had gone to many websites, support groups, and I don't know what else and complained about me. She said that I shame women, I shame overweight women (and minorities), I act superior because I can paint on a pretty face, and I bullied her. My yelp has 15 new bad reviews (and counting) from people who have never been clients, my google is the same, my youtube videos are getting really terrible comments, I've received many hurtful/vaguely threatening PMs/DMs on instagram, Facebook, twitter, and well anything I can get them on. She even shared photos of me on back page  with my real phone number. 



I'm scared, livid, and unaware of how to go forward. My boyfriend is upset but has no idea how to handle it as no one has been able to get ahold of Carrie to stop the brigading... even then my fear is that now a brigade has begun, Carrie won't be able to stop it. 


Was I wrong for sticking to my pricing structure with Carrie? 

How can I stop a brigade? 

Do I have to wait it out? 

How do I handle Carrie?
   
**tl;dr**: Friend asked me to do her make up. I informed her I charge for make overs. She arrived at my home late for an event i was looking forward to and demanded I do her make up. I refused and now she has started brigades against me which make me and my business look poorly. How can I stop a brigade? Do I have to wait it out? How do I handle Carrie?"
"[Updates] I [32M] need to exercise to manage chronic pain, my girlfriend [30F] of ~1 year is making this difficult


Update to: https://redd.it/4h1jxg

tl'dr of that post: I need to exercise regularly to stave off serious back pain, my gf of ~1 year, Debbie, guilts me into skipping my workouts.

It's been a few weeks since my first post, and I thought I'd let people know how it all panned out. Sorry, this gets long. I'm not good at telling stories, I don't know what's relevant or not.

The main thing I took away from the advice on that thread was that I need to grow a spine (haha) and not let Debbie pressure me into unhealthy habits. It also forced me to think more about how her behavior and neediness was more concerning than I had really appreciated.

So, a couple of days after that post I printed out a workout schedule (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and committed to getting up at 6am (I'm an early riser) to hit the gym. I showed the schedule to Debbie, and let her know that I'd be keeping to it as strictly as possible (barring emergencies). I tried to be non-accusatory, and she seemed supportive and understanding.

I make it to two morning workouts without incident, before she brings it up on Thursday night before we go to bed. She wants to know if I'll be going to the gym in the morning, and I tell her that of course I am. She tells me that she's missed me sooo much when I've been gone the two other mornings this week. I tell her that I'm really sorry about that, but we've spent every evening together, and she sleeps a couple of hours later than me anyway so I would just be hanging out to wait for her to wake up. I must have been too harsh with this, because she got very quiet and upset.

Unfortunately, I can be a bit of a people-pleaser, and I hate to see her unhappy, so I suggested that she come to the gym with me the next morning. Honestly, I did not want this, and I was hoping she would say no. It was dumb and weak of me to suggest it in the first place. But, she says she will come. I warn her that this means getting up at six and she just sort of laughs it off. The next morning, I wake up, and wake her up. She gets up and starts to get ready, but it's taking so long. After she's been in the bathroom for fifteen minutes I have to tell her that I'm leaving in ten minutes with or without her.

She comes out soon after and I see that she's been putting on her make-up. I'm flabbergasted. I understand that women live with a different set of expectations than men about appearance, but if she had planned to do make-up she should have planned her time ahead. (Is make-up before the gym even a good idea? Doesn't it sweat off? Never mind, this was weeks ago and I'm still a bit pissed.) I tell her that I'm twenty minutes behind schedule and I'm leaving. Her response is that it's okay, she doesn't need to be in the office until nine and there's plenty of time. I'm seething at this point, I have to go to the gym, and I have to be in the office by eight and I'm running out of time to get any of this done. The comment that _she_ has plenty of time so it's not a problem just makes me see red.

I count to ten, I focus on my breathing, I mostly calm down. We go to the gym, and I tell her that I'll be on the mats doing my exercise. She can join me if she wants, but it's pretty technical stuff and probably not that interesting to her. I'm probably being noticeably cold to her at this point as I'm irritated by the whole experience of the morning. I know it wasn't a mature way to handle it all, and I definitely could have been more accommodating of her feelings.

When I finish up, I can't find her. I try to call her, but it just rings out. I wait outside the changing rooms for a few minutes until I have to leave to go to work. I send her some messages to explain that I'm leaving the gym to go to work, and I assume she's done the same?

After that, I didn't hear from her for a couple of days. She made a couple of posts to Instagram so I knew she was alright, but she wouldn't respond to any of my direct messages/phonecalls. I send her an email to tell her I'm sorry I lost my temper, but I felt that she was disrespectful of my time and my health, and that we shouldn't try to go to the gym together again without a clear understanding of each other's timetables and needs. I assume that she's angry at me because I left the gym without her, which was shitty of me. I apologize for that as well.

Eventually, she calls me on Sunday afternoon. We meet to talk in a park (half way between her place and mine, neutral ground). Then I start to understand what she's thinking. Because my gym routine involves mostly stretches and light core work, I spend most of my time there in the ""female"" section of the gym (mats, swiss balls, yoga poses), and not the ""male"" part (heavy weights and intense cardio). I paraphrasing her thoughts, this isn't how I see the gym. Also, people who get to the gym early in the morning tend to look good because they're living healthily, exercising and all that. So, when she saw me saunter over to the corner populated by fit attractive women, it confirmed everything she was afraid of when we spent time apart.

Now she wanted me to quit that gym because she felt she couldn't trust me. I was distraught: I've never cheated on anyone and I don't think I've ever given her reason to think I would. I ask her if she can't trust me when I'm in the gym for less than an hour a day, how does she feel about me working all day, or hanging out with friends without her. Her view was that she couldn't change my work that so she just had to learn to live with it, and I don't see my friends often anyway so that's okay, but any extra activities should be restricted as much as possible. On the one hand, I can't believe that she honestly thinks we should spend every second of every day together, on the other hand that's exactly how she's shaped the relationship for months and I've let her.

We talked a lot more over a few days about jealousy and trust. At the end of it all, she won't budge. I have to quit the gym, or she can't see how she would ever trust me. For once, I don't just roll over and give her what she wants. It's not just about membership in an excellent gym (cheap, 24 hours, good facilities, great location). It's about her disregard for my health, disrespect of my time, and complete inability to show me any trust. In the end, I broke up with her. She didn't take it very well, first begging me not to, then getting angry and saying this proved that she was right about me. It was rough. After a few days of alternately abusive and begging texts/emails/facebook I ended up blocking her. ~~In a few months time I might unblock her and gently reach out to see how she is, but for now~~ I just can't have her in my life.

I definitely could have handled this all better. I think if I'd been more assertive early on then I wouldn't have gotten so quietly angry and maybe everything would have been cleaner.

**tl;dr**: ""Debbie"" revealed that she didn't trust me going to the gym (or doing anything else) alone. We broke up. :-(

edit: okay geez, guys, I get it. I'm not going to contact her in the future. :-) Thanks for all the feedback and support everyone."
"Me [30 M] with my niece [10 F]. Brother died. What do I do?


Hello Everyone,

This is my first time on reddit and I’m not quite sure how everything works, but judging by the other posts I think I’m in the right place.


I will try to be as brief as possible, but this situation is quite convoluted so it might take a while to describe everything clearly.

There is some background information that could be helpful to know.
I am German as is my brother and his wife. While they still live in Germany, I have been in Hong Kong for the past 11 years.
My brother and I have never been close, not even in our childhood. My parents died 7 years ago and since then I have been in touch with my brother exactly once. This was simply to arrange parents’ funeral, will, costs and anything else that needed to be taken care of. Since then it was radio silence. We don’t hate each other or anything of sorts, it just simply that we never cared for each other. To be quite honest if it weren’t for our parents we probably would have never talked. We also don’t have any living relatives anymore. My brother was married to his wife for quite some time, around 12 years I believe. They have a daughter that is now 10 years old.


My brother and his wife died 1 month ago in a car crash leaving behind the daughter. I learned of this from his lawyer whom contacted me roughly 3 weeks ago. I am now the only living family relative that the daughter, I will call her Anna, has left. The Jugendamt (CPS equivalent of Germany) has approached me and as I am the last living relative they want me to take care of her. While I am absolutely willing to do so there are several things that make me worry.


1.	I don’t live in Germany anymore, but Hong Kong. It’s a completely different culture and I don’t think it’s the best idea to rip someone out of their used surroundings and place them in a culture they have never experienced, even less so when her parents died a mere month ago.
2.	I have spoken and met Anna exactly twice before this. Once a year after she was born and then 7 years ago at my parents’ funeral.
3.	I am a 30-year-old, single male and have never planned to have any children. I have no idea how to handle, much less raise one.


The reason that the Jugendamt wants me to take her (adoption would ultimately be the final step of this process) is because there is no other fitting candidate. Considering my general situation, I found that hard to believe, but after having a lengthy discussion it turns out that’s the case. The next best option would be to hand her into foster care, but I quite honestly don’t want to put anyone through that. I am currently in Germany doing my best to take care of her with the help of the Jugendamt, but I cannot stay for much longer as I need to get back to Hong Kong. I have to make decision within the next 2 weeks on whether to take her with me or hand her into foster care. I have talked to Anna about what she wants, but she does not really know and I completely understand why. Ultimately I want to make the best decision for her.


I am usually working 10-11 hours each day, but since I am my own boss I can flexibly leave work during the day and complete the rest of it from home at night. The legal aspects of the Visa and living arrangements are also covered so there would be no problems there. I make well into the 6 figures and can provide for her without a problem, I also love to cook and have a fairly calm lifestyle, meaning I go to bed early and get up early.


I would like to get your opinion if it is best that I adopt her and if so what I could do to make sure that I can provide the best care she can get? If you have any recommendations on how to catch up on 10 years’ experience of raising children, I would also greatly appreciate it.




Thank you for your time.

TL;DR; Brother died and I need to decide whether to adopt my niece or not."
"My [18F] stepdad [52m] is threatening to cut me off of paying for my college after he found out I was sexually active. He wants a signed contract saying I won't have sex or I lose he and my mom paying for anything. My mom is silent as usual.


Edit: lots of people are saying to look for key loggers or other programs he may habe installed. I have all Apple stuff, MacBook, iPhone and IPad...how do I check for these things? Espcially maybe the cameras ? Is there things he could install to see what my camera is showing?


Edit 2: so this just got a whole lot weirder. I'm freaked out about maybe he saw some Skype stuff that I had (won't go into details but it was very private and not like cam girl stuff) so he just left for work and I got onto his desktop which id done before for school and snooped a little bit and there was a folder called ""random"" and in the sub folders were lots of porn. Another sub folder had my initials and I opened it and it was all pics of me in swimsuits from all the summer vacations we'd taken. There's nothing bad and I've seen most of the pictures before but it is super creepy that they are in his porn folder. I feel like I'm going to throw up. He's never touched me, I mean no hug even when I graduated type thing but this is ducking gross. Now it's a whole new problem.

Edit 3: just called my mom and said I needed to talk to her, she said that she couldn't come home and then screamed at me that it this was about Roger, I've been trying to break she and him up since day one and I've never given him a fair chance and he would never ask anything that wasn't fair and that he was twice the husband and father my real dad was (was to stick the knife in by saying that--sheesh) and that if I didn't like it I could move out by the end of the day. She slammed the phone down before I could even bring up the folder. I am fucking lost and don't even know where to begin. I feel gross, I feel violated I feel like my back is against a wall.


Edit 4 and last one for a while. Two detectives with the sherrifs department came, I showed them the folder and he said he was going to have to consult his supervisors but he was pretty sure There is now enough evidence to get a search warrant. I have no idea of the timelines. I called around to a few people and came up with my HS boyfriends mom who always really liked me. He's in Europe for the simmer so I can stay with her and his dad with no weirdness while this gets sorted out. I am not telling my mom that I'm leaving as I don't want her to tip roger and have him delete anything before the detectives can get the warrant.
Thank you very much for the help I will update in a few weeks if possible.

Throwaway as ""Roger"" is a big time redditor, but even then he may recognize this but I have no idea where else to turn.

My real dad died when I was 11. He went in to Doctor with a stomach ache and came out with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and was gone in 4 months. It was and is heartbreaking. 

My mom, as can be expected, was a basket case but even then she and I did ok by ourselves. We became more like sisters navigating the trauma because she was out of it as far as being a mother went. It actually wasn't bad and I grew a ton and it allowed me to focus on something other than my own loss. 

About 1.5 years later she met Roger online. He creeped me out from day one. Not like he touched me creepy but just very nosy and attached himself to my mom really quickly. He also tried to pretend to be my dad really soon which I hated. He has his own daughter roughly my age who ive never met because they are estranged which just adds to the whole bad vibe of him.

Despite numerous red flags my mom married him about a year after meeting. I did my best to be supportive of my mom but I spent most of my teenage years either in my room or at friends houses. To his credit Roger is a good provider and always promised to pay for my college out of pocket. I felt like he was trying to buy my love but I'm not stupid and realize that this is a generous offer no matter how I look at it. 

I just got home from freshman year and have resumed spending most of my time in my room. Tonight when I came down to eat, Roger was sitting by himself at the table and said we needed to talk. I sat down and he basically said ""your mother and I know you were sexually active at school. We are paying for you to get an education, not drink, party, get pregnant or get an STD."" He slid a piece of paper over the table at me which says that I promise I will not have sex while I'm at college and even had a place for me to sign. He said if I don't sign than I need either find a way to pay myself or drop out and get a job and either move out or pay him rent. 

I told him I would think about it but was and am REALLY creeped out because this feels so intrusive. I did have sex a few times but have no idea how he would know so I'm thinking maybe he's guessing which seems even weirder. 

I tried to talk to my mom when she got home but her exact words were ""I'm too stressed out with work to even think about discussing this."" 

I'm lost...totally lost. I don't even really care about having sex but this just seems so intrusive and weird and controlling. I could sign and just do my own thing anyways but that just seems to be playing his weird game.

Should I even consider this? If I don't I will very likely be cut off from college.

   
**tl;dr**: Stepdad is threating to cut off paying for college unless I sign a contract promising not to have sex. Do I even consider it?"

"UPDATE: I [22M] am at my girlfriend's [22F] family home in a faraway state. Feeling unwelcome, childish, and disrespected by her mother's [40'sF] boyfriend [40'sM]


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4marv8/i_22m_am_at_my_girlfriends_22f_family_home_in_a/)


So, since the events of my last post, I spoke with my girlfriend the following morning expressing how disrespected and unwelcome I'd felt, given the way Tim had treated me after I'd driven halfway across the country and spent my own money to bring Cindy back to her mother for a visit. I told Cindy that I wasn't going to put up with being treated like an intruder, and that I wanted to stay in a hotel room or find alternative sleeping arrangements for the rest of the trip. I said that I would be happy to go to dinner or something with her mother but that I didn't want Tim there because of the way he'd been rude to me. 

I was surprised at how well Cindy took all of this, and she said she understood and that she'd hoped Tim would be better behaved than he had been. Fortunately, she had an old friend who completely understood the situation with Tim and offered to let Cindy and I stay for a couple of nights until the trip was over. (If I haven't mentioned, basically everyone who knows Tim apart from Cindy's mother thinks he is absolute trash, and no one understands what she sees in him.) Tim and Fannie were away picking up Tim's son (""Michael"", 16M) and wouldn't be back in town for another day, so Cindy and I ended up staying over at the house again since they were gone and decided that in the morning, we'd pack up all our stuff and bring it to her friend's house; Cindy would find an opportunity to talk to her mother in person about the reason our stuff was gone and explain that we'd be staying elsewhere.

Fast forward to the next night, by which time we'd loaded all of our stuff up into my car and were simply waiting for them to return, when Fannie texts that their flight is delayed and they won't return until very late; Cindy tells her about the situation over the phone and tells me her mother sounded annoyed but understanding. We go to Cindy's friend's house and go to sleep, because we're attending her friend's baby shower the next day, as is Cindy's mother.

The next day at the shower, Cindy and I go and have a nice time until Fannie shows up and pulls her to the corner of the room to talk about the situation. She and Cindy talk, but Fannie begins making an absolute embarrassment of herself, crying openly in the middle of someone else's baby shower (she could easily have gone outside to have this conversation) and telling Cindy that ""carpaggio_throwaway needs to fix this situation"", saying how I'd apparently been ""disrespectful towards (Cindy's) family"" because I didn't stand up to shake Tim's hand immediately and how ""she sees traits in me that she saw in (Cindy's) father"" (whom she is divorced from.) She then leaves in a huff, having made quite the scene, and my girlfriend tells me what happened outside and says how upset she is with her mother. (I found out later, that after this all went down, Fannie talked with Tim and called Cindy's father in my hometown to talk about how disrespectful I was being, with Tim saying Cindy was ""choosing (carpaggio_throwaway) over her family."")

Cindy consults with her father, who suggests that, for the sake of smoothing things over with everyone, we be the bigger people and invite them out to dinner. I really, *really* didn't want to see Tim again, especially now that I knew he'd be aware of my reason for leaving, but Cindy understandably just wants her mother to love me the way she does, and so I agree to go to dinner. After a couple of hours, Fannie and Tim accept, and the four of us along with Michael meetup that evening for dinner.

It is an excruciatingly awkward dinner; everyone is civil and polite, but it is clear Tim is uninterested in getting to know me, though Fannie does make some small talk with me. At the very least, Tim says nothing rude to me, and I don't talk much throughout the meal. When the waiter asks about the check, I offer to pay for the meal, but Tim basically ignores me and insists upon separate checks.

We leave town the next day, stopping to visit Cindy's other family, all of whom love me. It seems clear that the commenters on the other post were correct about how toxic Fannie and Tim can be, and with any luck I'll be keeping them out of my own life, if not Cindy's, as much as possible.

TL;DR: Fannie and Tim turned out to be extremely toxic, and after an excruciating dinner and some ridiculous drama on their part Cindy and I have left town and aren't planning on returning soon.

EDIT: Cindy's dad was completely supportive of us throughout the whole thing, and he took the call knowing Fannie was in the wrong.

EDIT2: All right, I've gotten loads of comments that seem to think Tim was just joking, that I'm probably just being ridiculous when I say that everyone hates Tim, etc. so I'm going to list out more of the rude/shitty/abusive things he regularly does to people that I didn't think I'd need to go into. Hopefully it won't make people so sure that I'm some whiny kid who can't handle ""joking.""

-Tim has repeatedly called my girlfriend a ""whore"" in the past.

-Tim tried to force Fannie to put Cindy's brother in the military (not that she could have, but he still tried. Keep in mind these are not his children)

-Tim makes comments about women that are extremely inappropriate. He points out when Cindy's friends have skin showing or have gained weight.

 -Tim gives rude nicknames to EVERYONE, not just me. Everyone I've talked to hates it and doesn't think it's funny or a joke.

-Tim has had falling outs with nearly everyone in Cindy's family. Every family member I met on the trip thinks he's incredibly rude, abrasive, and borderline abusive, including Fannie's own parents."
"My [16, M] parents think all I do is masturbate, but I've really been playing 2048.


This is a little weird, sorry. Remember that game 2048 that was popular a couple of years ago? My friends and I were talking about it for some reason and I realized I had never beaten it. So over the past two weeks-ish I've been super into it (still haven't beaten it, btw, even though I know how to. so annoying).

Well I was playing a lot and I ended up spraining my hand. My parents think I did this masturbating. I tried to tell them that I was just playing a game on my phone but they kind of did the whole ""mhmm sure honey"" thing and since then my dad has talked to me twice about how it's okay to have these urges, but I should be careful about injuring myself. But I wasn't masturbating!

How do I convince my parents to stop giving me sex talks? How do I get them to believe that I was just playing way too much 2048?

   
**tl;dr**: I sprained my hand trying to beat 2048 but my parents think I've been spending all my time masturbating. They don't believe me when I tell them otherwise, and I don't want to sit through another sex talk.

**Edit**: I can't reply to all of these, but thanks! I'm going to try playing it in front of them and if that doesn't work, I'll just accept the temporary embarrassment. It could be a lot worse!"
"UpdateMy girlfriend (25F) of 6 months proposed to me (28M)


Thanks for everyones comments on my last post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m1dgi/my_girlfriend_25f_of_6_months_proposed_to_me_28m/)). People were asking for an update so here it is. We ended up breaking up. Not what either of us wanted but probably for the best. She said the reason she proposed was she felt like I deserved a wife and my son deserved siblings and to be a part of a real family. I won't get into how I feel about that but I understand where she is coming from now. I don't think she's crazy, I think she just got caught up in the idea of being a family and didn't have enough life experience to realize it. Anyways she gave me a book she was going to give to my son as a belated birthday gift which was really cool of her. It's customized so she probably couldn't have returned it anyways but she still didn't have to do that. She dealt with everything pretty well, although she did email my ex to apologize for trying to replace her which made my ex freak out a bit lol. 


I feel bad because I obviously did something to make her think I wanted her to propose and things were going so well before that but from what she told me this would have never worked out. I think she just needs someone with less baggage. 


Lastly, about my comment about not wanting to be proposed to, the issue is more that I prefer to be dominant in my relationships, not that she is a woman. She understood our dynamic just fine which is why it surprised me. 


**tl;dr**: we broke up, it wouldn't have worked out anyways. "
"My [38M] ex-wife [38F] intruded in my house and harassed me over my relationship with a [20F] girl, and is threatening to use it against me.

"I [32M] am on holiday with my wife [32F], son [12M] and sister [29F]. My wife is demanding my sister apologise to our entire family because our son walked in on her in the bathroom, my sister is refusing and its causing a big rift.


My wife and I have been married for 8 years, we got married a while after we had our son.  He's the only kid we've had so far.

We've recently embarked on a holiday trip, currently staying in a hotel room, including me, my wife, our son, and my sister who has joined us on the trip.  We've been here 5 days and we have a bit more than a week left before we're scheduled to go back.

Now I wasn't there when this happened, so all I have are second hand accounts.   Apparently when my sister was in the bathroom, (there's only one in our hotel room)  having a shower or whatever, our son walked in there.  Reportedly he didn't even knock, he just walked in, and my sister was in there naked.  Apparently she saw him and they had a chat together and she didn't bother to cover up the entire time, she was washing and drying up or whatever.

Now when my wife found out she freaked out, and I heard both accounts of events from both my sister and my son since they were the only ones present and it seems to match up.  My son didn't knock, he walked right in when he knew a woman was in there, he didn't apologise or excuse himself.

My wife is demanding my sister make this big and meaningful formal apology to all of us, for apparently the crime of 'exposing' herself to him.  Even though she didn't do anything, it was our son that was in the wrong for just walking in there without knocking or excusing himself or anything.  If anyone should apologise, its our son.

My sister said its okay, she doesn't think he needs to apologise, she thinks he's a good boy and he didn't mean anything wrong by it, he didn't do anything wrong, he just wanted something from the bathroom and he asked politely and they had a meaningful conversation.  She said he's very adorable and we should be proud we raised a good boy, but I told them I still think he should apologise for not knocking.

My wife is insisting that my sister apologise to all of us.  My sister is having none of it, she's refusing to apologise and insisting she did nothing wrong.  I agreed with my sister and my wife got angry at me for siding with my sister instead of her.  She said I should always side with her since she's my wife, but I told her she's being ridiculous about this whole thing since my sister did nothing wrong, its our son who should apologise.

My wife has been since giving the silent treatment to my sister, refusing to talk to her until she apologises and has been angry with me.  Its creating this really sour situation and ruining the entire trip.  Any idea what I can do to fix this stupid and horrible situation?

   
**tl;dr**: While staying in a hotel, our son walked in on my sister in the bathroom without even knocking or apologising.  My wife things my sister was in the wrong and wants her to apologise, my sister refused.  I sided with my sister and said our son is the one who should apologise.  Wife got angry, is not speaking to my sister at all, its ruining the entire trip."
"Me 42F with my stepdaughter 20F, wants me to apologize to her fiance


My husband and I have been married for 10 years and have two kids together. He has two children from his previous marriage. He shared joint custody of them with his ex. My stepkids lived with their mom and stepdad most of the week and we'd have them with us about 40% of the time. My husband and his ex had their issues, there were fights and arguments, but for the most part they managed to coparent in a somewhat civil fashion. 

When my stepdaughter Katie (fake name) was 16, she got pregnant. Her Mom is a religious Christian and is prolife. Everyone in her Mom's side of family is Christian and staunchly pro life. When Katie got pregnant things got very ugly with her stepdad. He was furious with her and things were bad enough to affect the relationship between him and Katie's Mom. Though the Mom is very prolife, she wanted Katie to have an abortion. 

My husband and I are not Christian and are pro choice. We gave Katie the option that she can choose what she wants to do. We promised to help raise the baby if she wanted to carry on her pregnancy and we also promised to help her with an abortion if that's what she wanted. She chose to go with an abortion. 

She couldn't get it done where we lived so we took her to a clinic that was in a different state. We paid all expenses and also took care of her out of state while she recuperated. She and her Mom wanted to hide this from her maternal relatives so we presented this as a vacation with Dad and stepmom sort of deal. 

Leading up to the date of the procedure, I reminded Katie that we will support her if she changed her mind. Even on the day of the procedure, before she went in, I reminded her that it's never too late to change her mind. The nurses and doctor at the clinic were very good to her, provided her with counseling and made her aware of all her options. Both my husband and I stayed with her through the entire ordeal and then we took her to a resort to rest and recover before we drove back home. 

While we supported her, we were very disappointed that she was having unprotected sex in spite of all the sex ed we had given her. After this procedure my husband and I gave her a strong talking to about the risks involved and insisted that she take some form of long acting contraceptive till she's ready to have kids. Based on her doctors recommendations she went with an IUD. Her Mom was upset with us for making her get on birth control and it was a point of contention for a long time.

After Katie graduated school and went to college we saw less and less of her. She'd spend plenty of time with her Mom and maternal relatives but would hardly ever see us. It was disappointing but she was an adult and it was her choice. I later learned that she had become very religious, like her Mom, and both of them disapproved of our lack of religious practice. 

Katie eventually met and got engaged to a Christian guy who she met through her grandmother's church. Her new fiance and his family is also prolife. We met him a couple of times and he seemed like a very nice guy who is good to Katie. 

At some point, the fiance came to know that Katie had an abortion. I have no idea how that whole thing came about, but he got pretty upset when he learned that. He came close to breaking off their engagement. He also learned that Katie uses an IUD and he has a low opinion of women who use such things. I don't really understand the reasoning but he believes people on long term contraceptives are sexually promiscuous. Or something to that effect. I am hearing everything third hand so I don't have an accurate understanding of what exactly the issues are between him and Katie. 

Katie cried and begged him to not break up with her and to convince him she claimed that she was forced into having an abortion by her stepmother. The fiance has met me only twice and throughout the relationship Katie has presented to him that she's not close to Dad and stepmom. She's shown him proof that we were the people who took her to that state and had her stay there. She has messages from me reminding her to get her IUD. She's shown him enough to convince fiance that she'd never had gotten an abortion or an IUD if it were not for her stepmother forcing things on her. 

Fiance has agreed to proceed with the wedding on the condition that she cuts off all contact with us. Katie agreed to go no contact with me but she wants her Dad to give her away at her wedding. Fiance will only agree to Dad's presence at the wedding if I'll apologize to both of them for forcing her to get an abortion and if I promise to stay away from them and their future progeny. 

I have no problem staying away from them but I am furious that she wants me to apologize to this guy. I feel so exploited by how this situation has come about. I spent my hard earned savings on helping this girl! My husband is upset at Katie too and says theres no way he expects me to apologize, but he is also very heart broken that he may end up missing his daughter's wedding. 

Should I suck it up and say sorry for my husband's sake? I am not entirely certain what the apology is supposed to look like, but I suspect it'll take a religious flavor and that is making me even more apprehensive.

Edit: I wanted to reassure some of you that I am safe and currently staying in a hotel (my husband doesn't know where, I had a friend book it for me).

I've been repeatedly refreshing the page and rereading all of your comments for hours now. I think I posted under the misguided hope someone would say something that would make sense and give me back the man I believed I married. Instead I've become more and more terrified that I've let it get this bad. I used to be very guarded when it came to relationships and I believed I'd been so careful to pick a ""good one"". It's been very difficult to accept the things people are saying but I realize I have no rebuttals and am too invested in who I believed my husband to be. There's nothing that will make this ok to me, it hurts more and more the longer I think about it. 

I have no idea what I'm going to do yet. At this point I still feel like I'm mourning the ""loss"" of my husband and future child.  I can't even contemplate engaging in the comments yet but I will try and update eventually when I decide what I'm going to do. First I'm going to get drunk and cry a lot.

My husband and I met three years ago on a dating website and have been married for nine months. He was a virgin when we started dating (which he chalked up to going to a very religious and primarily white high school and college while he was neither, not personal choice). I actually had to give him ""the talk"" and explain how our reproductive systems work. He was also somewhat insecure about believing that I found him sexually attractive. Because of this when we started having sex I was less assertive than usual and tried to remember to be extra understanding and patient because he is less experienced.


  
I admit I'm very easy-going sexually and don't have too many hard limits or preferences so it made sense to just let him be the one who sets the pace in our sex life. Things like anal, outdoor, or menstrual sex happened only as he became interested in them, etc. His only request that I've rejected was to film ourselves having sex but he was very understanding of my reasons, he wouldn't even ask me to send suggestive pics after that discussion.


  
We're a little bit mis-matched in the libido department. It became apparent he didn't feel comfortable turning me down if I attempted to initiate when he wasn't up for it. If he couldn't perform he'd become withdrawn and acted as if it were a failure on his part, regardless of what I said. I felt reluctant to initiate after this happened a few times so I asked if he could just be the one to initiate as he wanted because it doesn't take much to get me interested and he agreed. I have turned him down or limited our activity to oral on a few occasions with no issues. 


  
I have negative associations with the words ""dirty"" and ""whore"" and asked him to use ""filthy"" and ""slut"" instead because they don't throw me out of the moment. He made a token effort but ultimately asked me to deal with it because it throws him out of the moment to censor himself. He doesn't say them often and usually only does so to help him get into it when I ask him to be a little rougher or spank me (not his favorite but he doesn't outright dislike it) so I felt it was a fair compromise to ignore it and let him have what he needed to enjoy the kind of sex I request sometimes. 


  
We've also fallen into a couple of routines based on what works for him. Namely having him finish via oral before engaging in penetrative sex as he has a hard time not ejaculating prematurely. He lasts long enough the second round for me to get more than my share of orgasms and I enjoy giving oral (which he eagerly reciprocates) so this was a non-issue to me. 


  
He asked if we could have bareback sex after I started taking birth control and we both exchanged STD test results. I was very paranoid about pregnancy so I agreed only if we also used spermicide and the pull out method as well. After a couple weeks of this he asked if during my less fertile days he could finish inside of me during the second round as we were already using two other birth control methods. He also claimed his second ejaculation is ""less risky because there's so little of it left"". I agreed pretty quickly as I wasn't too fond of finishing him orally the second time because he'd usually taste or smell like spermicide by then.  


  
Now that we're married and he wants us to concieve I've stopped all methods of birth control (pill, spermicide, rhythm/pullout). Last week I told him I'd like him to finish inside of me the first round because I felt like that first ejaculation is more likely to result in a successful conception. I said I could finish him orally if he wanted the second round because he wouldn't taste of spermicide. He told me he prefers to finish orally the first time because it feels better that way. I conceded we only needed to change our routine for the three most fertile days of my cycle. He would not agree to that, he doesn't want to make any changes to our routine whatsoever. 


  
I told him I know it is probably irrational of me but I respect his personal superstitions (which he has admitted he knows are illogical) and expect the same consideration when I ask for something without a negative impact on him. I don't want to conceive (if I even can) using his stragglers and don't feel such a minor concession as changing up the order of our sex acts 3x a month is too much to ask for. 


  
He's accusing me of ""bait and switching"" his expectations of our sex life now that we're married and reneging on our ""unspoken agreement"" that he gets final say on how things work in the bedroom. He's cited my previous concessions I mentioned above as proof of that ""agreement"". I am absolutely shocked that's how he's intepreted our sexual relationship. He's also backpedalling on admitting his second ejaculation is typically much weaker and accusing me of thinking he's not ""potent"".

  

Since our disagreement we haven't had any sex. He told me not to ""worry"" about him asking for sex as he isn't attracted to me while I'm being ""disagreeable"". He's also made some comments that have left me feeling pretty disgusted and creeped out at the thought of having sex with him in the future. Namely that he liked having me defer him in the bedroom because it felt like ""payback"" after all those years of being controlled by ""girls who emasculated me by never putting out"", he deserves to have final say in the bedroom because he ""lets"" me have a say in all other aspects of our relationship, that he can't wait to see the look on my face when I finally give in and ""have to take my first load in your mouth"", he's asked repeatedly how long I thought I could hold out before I'd be desperate enough to beg him to do whatever he wanted, that he was going to make me ""earn"" his dick back, and once out of the blue he said ""I guess now you know why I was a virgin when we met"". When called on comments like that he clams up and refuses to discuss them or even clarify what he means. They're like verbal hit-and-runs. 

  

This is honestly a side of him I've never had reason to suspect existed. I would have said we've always resolved our disagreements respectfully and maturely but now in retrospect I'm realizing we've just never had a disagreement about something important to me. I usually make a concession because it doesn't feel like a big deal and I like making him happy. 

  

Right now I'm feeling like I've made a huge mistake marrying him. I don't know how to come back from this or if I even want to but I never would have committed to this man if I hadn't meant it. I need some perspective on the situation badly. 




   
**tl;dr**: husband doesn't want to have his first orgasm inside of me during my fertile days, despite being the one who wants to conceive ASAP and comments he's made since the disagreement have turned me off completely.

"My brother's [21M] girlfriend [19F] thinks I [22F] dress and act inappropriately around him. Does she have a point?


was told to repost. forgot the tldr for the first. 

My brother and I rent an apartment together. We attend the same university and are both in engineering courses. So we both rent an apartment that is close to the engineering faculty. Our rooms are next to each other but we use different bathrooms. My brother has been dating his girlfriend for 6 months and she comes over sometimes and stays over a few nights. She doesn't live with us permanently and pays no rent.


At home i wear shorts and tank tops or thin shift dresses. We live in a humid and hot country so i prefer to dress like that at home. The air conditioning in our apartment doesnt work properly and leaks if we leave it on too long. I have large breasts and have to wear bras with underwires and they can get very uncomfortable so i prefer not to wear a bra at home. Bro's girlfriend thinks i dress very inappropriately around my brother. She requested me to wear jeans or long pants in the house. I dont really think I'm doing anything wrong. Am I dressing too skimpy? She used the word 'skimpy' and revealing to describe it.


Bro and i share a balcony where we air dry our clothes. Sometimes i dry my underwear and bra there. My brother also dries his underwear there. His girlfriend freaked out about it and says i should not dry my underwear and bras around where my brother can see them. Is this inappropriate? Or weird?


Another thing is my brother does not wear a shirt around the house. This one i can see why she is upset over but this was how we were raised. My dad and brother often dont wear shirts around the house. I've seen my uncles shirtless in the house too. Its not a sexual thing in our family.

The last thing is that sometimes i pick up food for my brother on the way home and vice versa. Bro's girlfriend thinks this is something that we should only do for a boyfriend or girlfriend.
Personally i don't see anything wrong in the way I dress or behave around my brother. Its just two siblings sharing a living space. Do you think shes right?


**tl;dr**: my brothers girlfriend thinks I dress too skimpy and revealing and do other inappropriate stuff such as drying my bras and underwear where he can see them and buying food for each other which she sees as a boyfriend/girlfriend thing to do. Does she have a point?"
"I (22F) recently got a new job and only just told my best friend (22F). She's upset because she thinks I still resent her because she ""stole a job"" from me and I didn't tell her so we wouldn't have the same situation again (she's right on both counts).


Hey everyone. Apologies in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I'm on my phone. Also apologies to the relative high-school pettiness of this rant. 

A bit of background about my friend (Carol) and I. We met together when we first starting working at a fast food restaurant when we were 15. We've moved on from those jobs, to different companies and I've noticed that she tends to be one ""step"" above me in terms of how much she makes, and what sort of company she works for. For example, my previous job was in fast fashion and Carol worked in luxury - and got paid more as well. I absolutely have no issue with this and I was happy with the pay/effort ratio I had (she put in a lot more work). Another thing is that we both live at home with our families. I'm lucky enough that I don't have to pay anything (phone bills, car, insurance etc. are all mine, but I don't need to pay to live at home. All my money that I make is essentially spending money), while my Carol's family isn't as well off. She regularly needs to chip in for groceries, petrol money, that sort of stuff, but we sort of end up at around the same level of discretionary income as she makes more. 

So about a year ago, a really exciting job ad posted up. I was qualified for the role, it paid insanely well compared to most of the entry level jobs I had worked before, the hours were perfect to go along with university classes as well, the list goes on. I was incredibly excited about getting this job, and I thought I had a good shot at it as well. I sent a link and my resume to Carol for her to look over, and make sure everything sounded good, as I've done for her a couple of times. She came up with a few changes which I was happy with, and around an hour, she sent me a ""Btw I applied as well haha!"" 

I wasn't exactly happy about this, and there's nothing I could really say at the time (I said good luck or something like that), so I just let it slide and we didn't really talk about it. The interviews come and go, and I've been notified that I wasn't successful, but guess who got the job? Carol. 

The HR person at the time said that they really wanted to have me on, but they only had one position. They took down my details and promised to follow up with something soon. I know this means I didn't come across as compelling of a candidate than Carol, but I'm fairly sure that we're both very compelling employees. We both have excellent work ethic, and both of us make more than many of our friends. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think I would've gotten the job if it weren't for Carol. 

At the time I was really miffed, but again, I wasn't in a position to be legitimately mad at her. This new job meant she had some more time to herself while keeping the same amount of money which was really good for her, but I also really wanted that job. Eventually I let it go, but I can't deny I was incredibly salty.

Around a year has passed since that event, and around a month I got a LinkedIn invite from the HR person I was dealing with who now worked at a competitors company (a larger and better paying company at that). Basically, she wanted me to apply for a similar position at her company, which I went for. I'm happy to say that I just received my offer, and I told my friend.

Her first reaction was something like ""How come you didn't tell me, I'm meant to be your best friend, I could've helped you"". She seemed genuinely upset that I didn't tell her about the process, and I don't have any doubts as to her true intentions - but her lack of awareness as to whether it would make me upset or not irks me the most. EDIT: I didn't tell her about being approached for the role. I came up with some weak excuse about how I didn't want to jinx it, but she later asked if it was because I didn't want her to poach this job from her, and if I still resented her from when she ""stole"" the first job. I of course said no to her. 

She is absolutely right though, I didn't let her know about anything because I didn't want her to swoop in and steal it like last time, and the only reason I did that is because I still feel like she overstepped her boundaries in applying for a job that I wanted really badly.

I know of course that it's ridiculous for me to restrict her employment ""because I said so"", but I can't help but feel upset that she did so anyway. The fact that she thought that this was a reason I'd be upset is indicative that she knew taking the job would make me upset, and she only offered a single ""Sorry haha, something better will come along"" at the time. Of course, something has, and I've kept my old job up until now so I wasn't unemployed or anything.

I feel like I'm being very unreasonable, but I can't seem to shake off this feeling of resentment. Carol hasn't messaged me back after I said ""of course not"" to her questions, and it's been almost a day. We usually spend a couple of hours max. not messaging each other. I feel like her reaction sort of decides what happens from here, and I hope she's apologetic (and I know she has no obligation to do so) and has the ""I had no idea you felt like this"" revelation rather than going on the defensive. I have no idea if I'm being a drama queen or not, and I don't know how to patch things up with Carol.



  
**tl;dr**: My friend applied for a job that I was super excited to get, she got it instead of me. I've sort of held it against her, and it led to me not telling her I got a new job like hers until the very last moment. She asked if it was because I resented her - the answer is yes but I didn't tell her that. I'd like to patch things up, but I also want her to apologise. 

EDIT: cleared up some clarity about being approached (I didn't tell Carol about that part) and her ""obliviousness"""
"My [26m] parents [50s m&amp;f] took my childhood from me along with thousands of dollars. Haven't heard from them in 5 years and now they want to apologize...


Avid redditor, using a throwaway  since friends know my main and I am beyond pissed off right now.

So growing up my parents were obsessed with money and even though they couldn't keep down jobs, my mother was constantly  getting  new retail jobs and quitting  because it was too stressful  while my dad just kept getting  fired, my older sister and I had to work as soon as possible. When we were both 12 we had jobs as gold caddies and gave our parents our pay. That wasn't much but as soon as we turned 16 they demanded  that we both get full time jobs on top of school.

They told us that half of our paychecks went to the family and that they would give the rest of our earnings as an allowence  as needed. Even though my sister and I would work over 40 hours a week (we both had two jobs) we couldn't afford work or school clothes because our parents said  it wasn't in the budget. It came to a head when they started going to marriage  counseling  and began to have date nights (on our dime). We also were not allowed to drive so they took us where we needed to go.
   
My sister left home after she graduated  high  school  and joined the navy. She also told our parents to shove it when they asked for her last paycheck  before she left as ""living expenses"". They disowned  her and refused me to have any contact. We would speak through letters that she would write me and send to her friend's  house. Since I was the only one with a real income and pretty much brainwashed by them, my parents told me that I would need to increase my hours so I did what they said.

When I was 17 I worked for five hours every morning  at a donut shop before school, went to class, then worked a fast good job when class got out and double shifts over the weekend. My grades were shit so my dad had the brilliant  idea that I drop out and work full time at both places! I regret doing that every day and when my sister found out half a year she was livid and wanted me to live with her.

When I told them I was moving out they begged me to stay and my dad even cried and told me I was the only one keeping  our family off the street and that my sister just wanted to ruin everything. After I left they disowned  me as well when I told them I couldn't  send them money.

It was hard for awhile but my sister and her husband  let me live with them rent free as long as I studied for my GED  and helped out around the house. Years later my life is much better, I have my GED, I'm an assistant  manager  at my job, I take a couple online courses, and my own apartment  with my partner and 2 year old daughter.

Two nights ago I was mindlessly  browsing Facebook  when I got a message from a shared account the belonged to my parents. They don't even look like the same people that I grew up with. My mom works at a chruch  while my dad works for the city they live in as a grounds keeper. They told me that they were sorry for the way they treated my sister and I growing  up, that they were terrible  parents (I agree with that), and that they will have to life with what they did for the rest of their lives. They invited me to go out to lunch with them and they want me to bring my family with me if I wish.

I called my sister and she got the same message from them along with a friend of their telling  her how they are changed people  who ""deserve"" a second chance. Right now I am just seeing red and can't even  think straight. I want to tell them to fuck  off but at the same time I want to see them face to face and get an explanation. I'm a parent now and I can't even imagine  making my kid quit school  to support  me! Some outside  opinions would be great.


**tl;dr**: parents fucked up my childhood and lived off me. Now they want to apologize  "
"Me (23F) with my now ex boyfriend (24M). I broke up with him after he displayed cruelty for small creatures (snails) in front of me. He says I'm being too sensitive, is telling everyone I'm immature, and is begging for me back. Did I overreact?


[removed]"
"My fiance (24M) may smash cake in my (22F) face at our wedding.


Honestly this seems so silly to me. I've been dating my fiance for almost five years and we're getting married in November. We're on the same page about everything else wedding-related. Small wedding, short ceremony, fun party reception after. I've ended up planning most everything which isn't a big deal. The small details are important to me and not that important to him, so he's left me mostly in charge of what we do. Obviously we discussed colors, cake flavor, party favors, budget, etc. I've gotten quite a but planned ad showed him everything, and he's on board. 


Now one think I love love love about my fiance is his sense of humor. People probably listen to us and think we hate each other, cause we constantly rag on each other and talk shit. It's all in good fun, but a lot of our humor and jokes to one another are kinda at the expense of us. It probably sounds bad, but we always know when to stop. 


Now, I'm afraid that my fiance is going to take it too far. Even before we were engaged, I've said a million times that when I get fed cake at my wedding, no effing way would it be smashed in my face. I feel like it would be humiliating, it would ruin my hair and makeup, and maybe even my dress, and I just think it's disrespectful. And this is coming from a girl who got shoved into a mud puddle and had to walk around the rest of the day half muddy and LAUGHED. 


I've told my fiance several times ""no cake smashing!"" The first time I said it, his response was ""but it would be so funny!"" I told him in no uncertain terms that it was NOT funny to me. He agreed, but I'm suspicious it was just to placate me. 


I try not to bring it up too much in case it makes him annoyed or feel like I don't trust him, but every time he days ""okay, okay...I still think it would be funny."" It just leaves a pit in my stomach that he may still do it. 


So what do I do? I've made it very clear I am not okay with this and I still fear he may do it. I'm hoping if I get enough people agreeing with me I can show him this and show that people hate it. Or maybe I'm just being a downer. Idk. I would be pretty unhappy if it happened. 


Tl;dr: my fiance thinks it's funny to shove cake in people's faces at weddings but it's humiliating to me. I'm afraid he's going to do it."
"(UPDATE) My coworker (30M) comes up to me (27F) and tickles me regularly. I've asked him to stop a lot and he won't.

"I [24F] was raised by my brothers [33M &amp; 32M]. My wedding is close and I don't know which one should walk me down the isle.


I lost my parents when I was 10. My brothers were 19 and 18 at the time. My older brother became my guardian and both my brothers raised me. We all lived together until I was 20. They were both really good and I owe them everything in my life. They didn't have to take care of me, they were kids themselves but they had us stick together and I grew up with family in a loving home.

Now I'm getting married soon. Well. This question exists. Who should walk me down the isle? The eldest brother? They're only 11 month apart. They had an equal role in raising me and I love them equally. I don't want to pick one over the other. Will it be weird if I have them both do it at the same time, one on my left one on my right?

Anything else we can do here that can involve them both?

I invite all ideas here. I want them both to feel special and know how much they mean to me.
   
**tl;dr**: Brothers raised me. My wedding is close and I don't know how to handle the walking down the isle part without picking one over the other."
"(22F)My flatmate (22F) wants me to cover up when I'm around her boyfriend (25M)


I've been friends with this girl for EVER, since we were toddlers probably, she was always carefree and fun to be around. 

We've been sharing an apartment for the past 6 months and at first it was amazing, but now her insecurities are starting to drive me INSANE.

She's been with her boyfriend since she was 15, and she's kinda controlling- for example;

She doesn't let him watch porn, she thinks watching porn is cheating, looking at photos of girls online is also cheating.

He's not allowed to make friends with women or talk to any women unless they're her friends, if they're attractive then she thinks it's a form of cheating too

He's not allowed to go to the beach without her cause there's skinny girls and he might ogle them (seriously, she said that) she doesn't go with him either cause she's insecure about her weight

We can't ever watch movies together cause when she sees an attractive actress she accuses him of ''thinking of fucking her'' (I've witnessed too many of these arguments, it's embarrassing)

She doesn't let him friend women on social media

She won't let him hang out with friends cause they're single and ''attract women'' and will ''brainwash him'' into cheating on her. 

Now, I don't really care what she does in her relationship, I mean if the guy enjoys being isolated and emotionally abused then it's not my place to tell him otherwise, but lately she's trying to control how I live MY life. 

Her boyfriend is usually there when I get home from work, which is around 6PM then he leaves late at night.. I don't always chill with them, so most of the time, I shower, change into some comfty clothes (sweatpants/shorts and a Tshirt) and go to my room to read or watch something or pass out. 

Yesterday she started complaining that my shorts are too short for me to wear around her boyfriend, and I'm ''putting on a show''

I told her that this is MY apartment too and I'm allowed to change into comfortable clothes after work, and there is no way in hell she's going to dictate what I wear and what I don't wear, she yelled at me and said I'm insensitive to her feelings, that I'm just as bad as the girls in porn (lol wtf) and that I'm doing it on purpose to show off how thin I am and make HER feel fat. 

??????????????????????

I tried to explain that I'm not doing any of those things cause that's just RIDICULOUS, I'm just trying to feel comfortable in my own HOME. She threw a fit. She wasn;t even listening to what I was saying, just talking over me and yelling about stupid shit. 

I got really angry so before saying something that I'll probably regret, I shut up and went back to my room. 

This already happened twice before, the first time she complained that my dress was too tight, and I told her that it's none of her business what I wear.. (another tantrum) and the second time she was complaining that I don't wear a bra at home and I should have some decency around her boyfriend.. I started wearing a bra after that to keep the peace. 

Should I bother with this girl or just leave and try and find another roommate? I'm really getting sick of her flipping out and being completely delusional, I feel like she doesn't respect me at all. 

Is there any hope?

TL;DR - Best friend is very controlling with boyfriend and now is trying to control what I wear around him, not sure if I should try and fix things or just leave. "
"My (f/25) fiancé's (m/25) father (m/53) asked me to not ""force"" his son to marry me, need advice.


My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years, since college. We are very happy in the relationship and have been even more so since we got engaged.

We are getting married later this year and the issue is with his father. The other day he approached me and asked me to stop trying to force my fiancé to marry me when he is so young. When I asked him what he meant he said that he does not believe his son is old enough to start a family yet, and while he understands I might be under pressure from my ""bio clock"", I should be more understanding. This conversation made me few really strange. I don't know what my next move should be. Should I talk to my fiancé? To his father or to his mother? What should I say? 

Tl;dr: fiancé's father is asking me to stop forcing his son to marry me and I don't know how to proceed. 

EDIT: I know I will be asked these questions, so I'll just summarize here:

- I absolutely am not forcing anyone to do anything, my fiancé has always been very excited about getting married to me. He was the first one to start the conversation and has indicated at every step of the way that he wants us to be husband and wife.

- Once again my fiancé has no reason to feel ""pressured"". Believe it or not some men are way more eager than some women to start a family. HE was the one who wanted to get married and he was the one who decided it will be this year. So yeah, no.

- We both are very financially stable - great jobs, own cars, no debt, in the next couple years should save enough to buy our own house, even though neither of us minds renting apartments. 

- His parents got married when his father was 26 and his mother was 20. They are still together, but I think he might be projecting.

- I am not looking for an opinion about whether or not we are to young to get married. I understand that you and I might have differing views on the subject, but my fiancé and I have already made up our mind. The only advice I need is about how to deal with the future in-laws so that our relationship is not completely ruined. 

- To everyone here who wonders why I haven't talked to my fiancé yet. His father approached me about it two days ago. My fiancé is currently on a business trip abroad (in his line of work he has to travel every 2-3 months for about a week or so), and I don't want to worry him because I know he is incredibly busy. I'm waiting for him to get back tomorrow, since I want to discuss it in person. "
"Boyfriend (25M) of almost 4 months dumped me (25F) over a stupid autocorrect mistake


Ugh repost because I forgot the title the first time, ignore that one.

I'm posting because this is totally ridiculous and I would like suggestions on how to get through to him or if I should just let this go.

We were at my place earlier tonight and I was in the shower. When I got out I found a note from him that says: ""So how long did you think you could keep your real job a secret from me? Glad I didn't get in too deep. This is done, don't try to contact me.""

My job is a hybrid one as a freelance photographer, designer, and model. A lot of my friends are very artsy and into design and fashion and such, if they have projects or if there are other people trying to sell handmade jewelry or clothing, I model the items for their websites, ads, etc.

I had no idea what my boyfriend was talking about until I opened my phone to call him and found it already open to a text conversation with a client I just got yesterday. That woman wanted me to model and had told me she'd be in contact when she found a photographer to set up a date to do the shoot. So her text to me came when I was in the shower and it reads ""The pornographer can come this weekend if you want to do our shoot then."" Her phone changed photographer to pornographer and my boyfriend must have seen this text appear on the screen since I left my phone out. I'm assuming he was suspicious and opened it and saw it was from someone he'd never heard me mention as a friend or client and assumed I'm secretly doing porn.

Maybe that's not unreasonable in itself but he has now blocked me on literally every platform we had each other on and could communicate on. He lives about half an hour away so short of taking the subway over there I have no way to talk to him and explain this. 

The thing is I like this guy a lot, we have a lot of fun together and he's smart and creative and I could see us being in a long term relationship. I'm slow-paced in relationships and not madly in love with him or deeply hurt right now, more pissed off and confused. If this is how he handles the slightest misunderstanding, like blocking out all possibility for communication, is that a sign that resolving actual problems in the future won't go well? Should I pursue this and explain the mistake, or should I take it as more of a blessing in disguise?

TL;DR boyfriend broke up with me over a client's autocorrected text that implied I'm in porn without giving me any chance to explain or way to contact him. Is this worth clearing up and continuing the relationship given that this was his reaction?

"I [27/f] found some letters that my husband [30/m] wrote while unpacking boxes. They are made up of things he dislikes about me. I'm not sure what to do.



Sorry if there are typos. I’m typing this quickly.
 
Jake and I have been married for a year- together for a total of 5 years. IMO, we’ve had a healthy relationship. We rarely argue/fight, but if we do, we are pretty good about communicating with each other in order to solve problems. I’ve always thought this was something that we didn’t need to work on. But now, I think I might be wrong…
 
A month ago, we bought our first house together. We just moved in last Friday so I took this week off to unpack all of the boxes. I’ll admit that we weren’t very organized and threw a lot of things into random boxes as we got more anxious about moving in. So, some boxes are a mixture of random things from both of us.
 
Yesterday, as I was finishing up the remaining boxes, I opened one and found pages and pages of what looked like letters. I thought it was weird since I had never seen them before. The one on top was dated for March 2011 and had my name on it. I’m not sure if this is wrong but I read it. And I kept reading them. Now, I’m not sure if there is anything he even loves about me….Here are a few excerpts from 2015-2016 (with some of my comments):
 
-”Today Bailey made some recipe that belonged to her grandmother. It was absolutely disgusting” Not that bad but…ouch.  
 
-“…it’s a good thing she’s good in bed because she talks too damn much”
 
-“It’s weird how close she is with her parents”
 
-“Sometimes the amount of kisses that she gives me turns me off.”
 
-“ I’m planning on proposing to Bailey but her lack of interest in exercising worries me that she can become fat or unmotivated”  I exercise 3 days a week, am 5’9” and weigh 135 pounds. I’m not sure where this came from and I don’t think I’m unhealthy?
 
-“..I wish she’d just get a better paying job…” We’re financially sound with little debt and I make 55k. That seems average for our area. I love my job.
 
-“Yesterday Bailey asked if I could clean the litterbox while she was gone. What I really wanted to tell her was to shove it up her ass...”
 
-“…sometimes she can be so clueless…”
 
-“She’s got a great sense of humor and her smile is beautiful. But that laugh is just awful”
 
-“I’ve always said I want kids but I don’t know anymore. Can’t really see myself being helpful with them.” probably the biggest blow to me since raising a family is something that I want and something that he’s always expressed that he wants.  
 
-“I don’t think I could live without that woman but sometimes I just can’t stand to be around her.”
 
Note: the letters weren’t always about me but I made up the majority of them. Everything about me is negative or passive aggressive. 
 
I’m honestly not sure what I just read. Is he venting? Some of these are pretty hurtful and I had no idea he felt that way. He’s always been sweet and caring toward me but these seem hateful. He has these from back in 2011. Is this normal behavior? 5 years worth of letters about things you dislike about your SO? When Jake got home, I asked him if there was anything that was bothering him or he wanted to talk about but he just looked at me confused and said no. I asked if he wanted chicken for dinner (the recipe he said he hated in the first quote) and he smiled and said yes.
 
So…
 
Should I let this go? Or bring it up? I can’t help but to feel so hurt about this. It’s almost like he hates me. I feel like I’m in shock- he has never said anything negative about/toward me. It seems like he’s a different man. I’m not sure what to do. I understand that these are his private thoughts but why would you marry someone if you dislike these things about them?

**tl;dr**: I came across some letters that my husband wrote while unpacking boxes. In them, he explains things I do that annoy him or that he doesn't like. I've never heard him express these feelings before and I'm hurt by them. "
"Boyfriend [25M] and his sister-in-law [28F?] sneaked out to the beach at 3am.


OK so last night that happened. We've been together for a year.

We were visiting his parent's house (who live by the beach) and his brother was also there with his wife. We stayed there last night and at around 3am I was half sleep and noticed that he's leaving the room. I thought he's probably going to the bathroom or something. I heard some noises from downstairs and I wasn't paying attention until I saw from the window that he's going out to the beach with his brother's wife!

They came back about an hour later.

I still haven't confronted him and was wondering what this could mean. What was it that they needed to do? I don't know what to think. Is it something that I can be upset about? Sneaking around at night isn't cool in my opinion.

"My [35M] girlfriend [34F] of 4 years wants me to move out my dad [74M] out of my house and put him in a home when we get married and she moves in. I told her its not happening.


My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, we've been talking about our future and marriage prospects for a long time.

My father is quite old and not very abled.  He can walk with a frame, but he's very old and tired and has bad hips.  He needs help with many things, has poor vision, needs help with his medication.  I've spent a lot of money making my house safe and suitable for him to ensure he's safe in it.  I have a carer who comes daily and helps out with certain things, such as in taking care of my father and housework and other things.

My wife has said that when we get married and live together, she'll move in (my house is more than big enough for all of us), she wants me to move my dad out and put him in an aged care home.  She said she doesn't want him to be in the way of our relationship and family and she doesn't want to have to constantly worry about an old man when we're together.

I told her its not happening, he's my father. I've seen the state of some aged care facilities, they really neglect their patients, it can be a really depressing environment and from what I've seen (I've been around them a lot), it seems sub optimal and I think my father would be much better off with me.  Not to mention we have extended relatives nearby and its within short and easy travel distance, and he's much more comfortable here and at home with me.

It seems to be a major obstacle when dealing and discussing our future plans together, she seems to really think its the best idea but I've said I'm not budging on it, my dad stays with me.

What should I do? How can I convince her to see my side of this, or is this relationship really not worth it?  To be honest, its made me see her in a much darker light and I think her insistence on it has made me harbour some resentment.


   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants me to move my dad out and put him in a home, I told her its not happening.  Major stumbling block in our future plans together."
"My [30F] sister [38F] is suddenly mad at me because her daughter [7F] likes the nickname I gave her more than her real name.


Let me say from the beginning that I do not think I have a right to tell my sister how to parent. If she wants her kid to be called name a instead of name b, that's her decision, not mine. However, this situation is a little odd, and I'm not sure how to feel or how to proceed.

I feel I should point out that I love my sister, but she is a narcissist. It was terrible to grow up with her, and she made our lives difficult until she finished college and moved out. Our family is well aware that she originally had a child to ""snag"" her husband (who is very passive and co-dependent) and to get attention. Although she definitely loves her daughter, Jordan, and takes decent care of her, my sister is not an empathetic person and isn't the most attentive mom, so her daughter has become attached to a few other people in the family. That seems to be how Jordan's emotional needs are met. For some reason, kids like me, and she has gotten very attached to me in particular. (My mom says it's because I do things for her her parents don't usually do, like read to her and let her play with my makeup.)

Now, when Jordan was a baby, she could be very mischievous and goofy, so I would sometimes say, ""Aren't you just a little Beelzebub?"" *At no point did this offend my sister or brother-in-law, even when my sister asked what ""Beelzebub"" meant and I told her.* When Jordan began taking, she'd repeat the word back as ""Beezy,"" and it stuck. From then on, she was ""my Beezy,"" ""Beezy-boo,"" ""Beezy Wheezy has a Sneezey,"" all of the ridiculous shit you say to toddlers.

Then Jordan got a little older and went to kindergarten, and she started telling people to call her Beezy instead of Jordan. *Again, nobody in the family had a problem with this.* The teachers and other students all called her Beezy without issue.

Jordan is finishing first grade, and we were having a little party to celebrate the summer last week. At the party, Jordan asked if she could out on some lipgloss, and I said, ""Go ask your mom, Beezy."" My sister suddenly snapped and started yelling at me to stop calling her daughter that ""ridiculous"" name, because I was calling her the devil and all of the other kids make fun of her for it. Jordan got mad and said she didn't want to be called Jordan, she hated that name, and my sister told her that was her name and that was what she was going to be called. Nobody in immediate earshot knew what to do then, so we all kind of sat around uncomfortably and ate our food.

I later asked my sister why she didn't want me using a nickname for her daughter, especially since her daughter liked it a lot and felt it suited her. She came up with two excuses that I think are complete bullshit:

**It comes from ""Beelzebub,"" which means the devil.** I would get this if my sister was really religious, but she's what I call ""conveniently religious."" She doesn't go to church, has never read the Bible, and knows next to nothing about the religion. She just mentions God and Jesus whenever it's convenient for her, especially if she's trying to shame somebody. (For instance, we had a fight about something completely unrelated, and suddenly I'm a ""terrible atheist"" who needs to ""find Jesus"" because I believe in evolution.) My sister had *zero problems* with this nickname until this moment. Also, she is now claiming she named Jordan for the river Jordan, but that's a complete lie. She got the name out of a book of baby names that just listed names by letter. Honestly, the only Bible stories she really knows are Noah's ark, Exodus, and the virgin birth; the rest is just her parroting what other people say.

**The other kids are making fun of her for the ""stupid"" name.** I know this isn't true because I work at the school my niece attends. We live in a diverse area, so the kids have names from a huge range of cultures and languages, and nobody bats an eye at ""Beezy."" The teachers and other students have called her Beezy for two years now without issue. She is very popular at her school, too, and gets along well with a lot of the other children.

Really, I'm just not sure what to do or what to make of this. I can't force my niece to use her birth name, can I? And I get the feeling this isn't about the name, but is more about my sister's possessiveness and jealousy.

   
**tl;dr**: I gave my niece Jordan a nickname (Beezy) when she was born, it stuck, and now lots of people call her that and she likes it more than her birth name. My sister was fine with it until this last year. I'm not sure what to do, since her daughter is the one who tells people to call her Beezy and I think my sister is maybe more upset over my relationship with my niece."
"My best friend (27 F) admitted to me that when she was trying on her wedding dress that she called her ex to see if they still had a chance


My best friend (27 F) is getting married in October. She told me recently (after I suspected sadness and pryed it out of her) that as she was trying on her wedding dress that she called her ex and asked if there was still a chance between them. He eventually told her no. 

I told her it wasn't too late to call it off... That I'd be by her side and help her with everything including moving out of her house and starting a new life. She continued to say that she was now happy and moved on, but then contradicts it with comments like ""I don't really want to talk about my wedding because the attention makes me uncomfortable."" 

I think it's more than just cold feet. A part of me knows that she romanticized her last relationship with her ex because he was by her side when her mom tragically died 10 years ago. It was such a difficult time in her life and I know planning her wedding without her mom has been painful because it has brought up raw feelings that she never worked out in her grief. When I brought this up to her she whole heartedly agreed that was the case. 

Her fiancé is not a good match. He is a dud emotionally for her charisma. She told me she dislikes his family, doesn't have good sex and does not like being the breadwinner in the relationship. 

A lot of her family and friends agree with me that she isn't making the right choice but no one wants to confront her. Throughout our 10+ years of friendship I have always been the one giving her my opinions and tough love. Sometimes it's even caused some major conflicts and distance between us. Everyone in her life just assumes I'll be the one to say something. Everyone is waiting on me. I love her to death.. But this is exhausting. 

On another note, I'm also worried about her stress and her health, especially with the long history of cancer in her family. I know there are worse things than divorce, but do I continue to pry when she's defiant or should I sit on the sidelines and watch her make a huge mistake? I've already voiced my opinion. She seems to be set in her ways. 

I have never suffered a loss of a mom nor have I been engaged so it's hard for me to understand completely what she's going though as much as I want to. 

Thank you so much for your time and your help. 


tl;dr: how do I tell my best friend that I don't think it's a good idea for her to get married?

"(update) Me 42F with my stepdaughter 20F, wants me to apologize to her fiance


**Edit:**

Thank you all for your kind words and support! On Friday, we took an impromptu road trip. We avoided the internet and shut our phones to get away from this noise. I am sorry I didn't respond to messages here, but this was a much needed break. I had become very depressed over this stuff and traveling with my family put this issue in perspective. I have a lot to be thankful for and I have a lot of love in my life. The situation with Katie is unfortunate, but she's in for a lot more heartache than what I am going through. She isn't a bad person, but she has struggled with low self esteem and like most of us is searching for love and acceptance. I hope both she and her fiance grow in wisdom and learn to be happy. 

I have friends and siblings who support me. I also heard from my sister in law and husband's Aunt who gave me encouraging words. I had wanted to move to be closer to my family for a long time. They live on the other side of the country. We stayed here to be close to my stepkids. Katie's younger sibling with be 18 soon and we are planning on making a move close to that time. We had a lot of fun dreaming up places where we'd want to live. 

Since this came up in the discussion in comments, FIL's notion of the proper help for Katie was for us to have taken her away so that she could have the baby and then bringing back her kid as our child and pretend s/he was Katie's half-sibling. Yeah ... their heads are stuck in the 1920s. FIL and MIL are in no position to raise a child and at no point did they offer that they'd have helped with that. That'd have been our responsibility.

We have just started catching up with missed calls and messages that we were avoiding over the weekend and found an irate message from Katie's Mom berating my husband for being an awful father. She suggested that stepdad will be the one giving Katie away at her wedding. That actually made me laugh for a bit, but then I thought about what Katie must feel to have that happen and I felt sad for her.


-----------------------------------------------------


[Original Post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n7lfl/me_42f_with_my_stepdaughter_20f_wants_me_to/)

I'd like to thank everyone who left comments with support and advice on my initial post. I really appreciate each one. Things have gotten much worse and I haven't had a chance to respond to all your suggestions, but they were very helpful.

Many of you had pointed out that Katie's fiance sounds abusive and suggested that I should try talking to her about that. I left a few messages for Katie asking to see her, when she didn't respond I left her a voicemail asking her to talk to me so we can discuss what she wants me to say. I invited her over for lunch and we had a long conversation. Unfortunately, it did not go well. 

Katie has a very different view of how things went down. When I pointed out that I had given her a choice and would've supported her if she had kept her baby, she denied that I ever said that. After much back and forth she acquiesced that was said, but she believes that we were all putting pressure on her to abort. Husband and I had gone over the possible problems she can face having a kid as a teen, but I saw that as us being realistic and honest. She remembers that as everyone ganging up on her to force her into this decision. 

I asked her why am I the one expected to apologize, what about the other three people involved. Her stepdad and Mom were the ones who were insisting on abortion. She had come to us asking for help with getting an abortion. We weren't the one who suggested that she should go get one or that was her only choice. But in her view, her Mom was forced by stepdad, her Mom is a victim too and she hates her stepdad (but he's in the wedding and no one's blaming him.) And she thinks her Dad goes along with what I want.

About the IUD issue, we misunderstood the problem. It's not her fiance who has a problem with it. Katie resents that I pushed her to get an IUD. I did insist on her getting some form of long acting contraceptive because she wasn't a reliable kid who can manage taking pills on time. Husband and I both insisted on this. We don't have a lot of money, we were supporting four kids and if we had to support a fifth, we'd have managed somehow but that wasn't an ideal scenario. Our finances were already stretched. It was clear that if Katie got pregnant again her Mom and stepdad wouldn't help her. Honestly, I was very worried about something like this happening again. Taking her for her abortion had been pretty expensive for us. I was concerned and I did remind her again and again to get contraception.   But I remember phrasing this as reminders. Katie tends to procrastinate everything and if I ever need her to finish a task I have to send several reminders to her. That's what I was doing, but she is recalling it as me forcing her and is still angry about it. The only written dialogue she has from that time period is my messages reminding her to get birth control and she has retained that as proof that the pressure came from me. 

Katie is under a lot of pressure to marry her fiance. Katie's Mom's family doesn't have much money and this guy comes from big money. Not super rich, but his family name is a big deal in the small town that ex's family lives in. Her family sees it as Katie making it big by getting engaged to this guy and getting his name. They'd be devastated if the wedding didn't go through. Katie herself is convinced that this guy is the best thing ever. When I tried to point out that his views are not so great, she only got more mad at me.

The other issue she has with me is that she dislikes her step dad. She hates that her parents got divorced and she believes my presence has ruined her life. After my husband got divorced from her Mom, he was in a serious relationship for a while and that ended badly. Katie was very young and became convinced that now Mom and Dad will get back together. But then I came into the picture and we got married. A few years later her Mom and stepdad got married. Katie believes that if I hadn't showed up, Mom and Dad would've gotten back together and she wouldn't have to put up with stepdad. That whole concept is so immature I don't know how the hell I can argue against that.

It was heart breaking to realize that this kid really hates me. We were never close, but we got along ok, or so I thought. I was mad at her for blaming me, but a big part of me thought that she was doing so out of desperation. But the reality is worse than that. She actually hates me and is convinced I ruined her life. I tried reminding her of the things I had done for her, I tried showing her I had taken good care of her and watched out for her, but we got nowhere with that. In the end she told me that I've ruined way too many things for her and I owe it to her to not ruin her wedding.

After she left I talked to my husband about our conversation. He got more upset about this and decided to have a long conversation with Katie and settle this. I don't know the details but it didn't end positively. Husband has told Katie that he can not support her wedding and he is very disappointed by her actions. He has told her that I will not be apologizing and even if I chose to do so he is not attending her wedding.

Later, we had to hear an earful from FIL who is upset at us because of this issue. Husband drove over to talk to his father and explained the situation. That we didn't make her get an abortion, she wanted one. 

Katie is FIL's favorite grandkid. He doesn't like me much since I kept my maiden name after marriage. He has never been unkind to me, but I don't have a great relationship with him. Husband's explanation didn't calm him down. He argued that Katie was/is a child and we were the adults and we should've taken care of her and instead we took actions that are ruinous to her. He doesn't see Katie as responsible but sees us as the bad guys for what was done. He has given us the ultimatum that if this issue isn't fixed, that is, if I don't apologize and do whatever is necessary to appease Katie and fiance, then we are no longer welcome in his house. Husband got very angry at this and they argued and now we've been banned from family events (and yes this ban extends to our two kids too.)

I have a good relationship with my MIL and she is sympathetic to me, but is encouraging me to have a heart and do what is needed for the sake of family harmony. I have received messages from some of the in laws pressuring us to fix this issue. I am not sure what they have been told, but I've been inundated with messages that range from asking me to be generous for the sake of the poor girl to accusing me of being selfish and coming between father and daughter. Right now I am so overwhelmed by all this I have not addressed these attacks at all.
   
At this point I don't know what I am going to do. I have hunkered down and I am lying low. I know I am not going to apologize because anything I say can have worse repercussions for me. I can't help what Katie thinks or does but I am getting worried about further backlash against my kids. I am very relieved that my husband is fully in my corner. 

**tl;dr**: Katie believes her fiance is awesome and doesn't think she is lying. No apologies from us and we are avoiding the wedding. Have heard back from many relatives that they are mad at us. "
"My exwife [39F] wants to attend my [39M] wedding. My girlfriend [29F] and I don't want her there.


I married my ex wife at 22. We were high school sweethearts and got together at 16. I've known since a very young age that children were not going to be in my future. I had no interest in becoming a father at any point in my life. I know some people change their minds but for me it was a sure thing. My ex claimed she also didnt want children. We had a blissful marriage until we were 30 when she said she wanted children. I still didnt want children. This led to a lot of fighting and we eventually divorced at 32. 

Even after we divorced she still had quite close relations with my family. I think everyone was shocked that we got divorced as we seemed to be happy. Eventually i told my parents and siblings i was uncomfortable having her around after the divorce and the relations faded away. 3 years later I met my current girlfriend and we are getting married soon. My girlfriend is sterilised and doesn't want children so we're much more compatible. My ex wife has contact with some of my cousins on social media so I assume thats how she found out. She congratulated me and asked for invitations to the wedding. Is it wrong of me to not want her there? She's not a bad or crazy ex and I know she won't cause any trouble or do anything spiteful. I just don't want her there. I want her completely out of my life. I kind of want to pretend she doesn't exist at all. Is that childish or petty? My girlfriend supports my decision to not invite her. I just want some some validation from reddit. Thanks.

"I [26F] missed an important funeral and now I think my 5 year relationship with my partner [28M] might be over.


Before everything happened between us we were solid, I thought this guy was my forever. We’ve lived together for the past 3 years and I always loved him and the way we supported and helped each other. He used to say we were family, and we would always look after each other.

This year was my final year in Uni, to get my MArch and my Part II exemption to become an architect. In March this year, the final printed copy of my research project was due, basically a culmination of the past 7 years of my education. 

Unfortunately in this time my partner's grandmother passed away; this woman basically raised him when both his parents couldn’t deal, they were incredibly close, in her final years she got dementia but she always remembered him and their little inside jokes, he loved her so much, probably more than anyone else in the whole world.  

Over those few weeks after she passed away, I tried to spend a lot of time with him. I took him to the archdiocese and we lit candles and walked through the gardens and talked about his grandmother. His friends came up for a visit that weekend and I spent the weekend with them to keep him happy, even though I should have been working on finishing my research project. I took care of him all that week, letting him rest and try to mourn, unfortunately his boss is a huge prick and it was a struggle for him to get any time off to properly rest and take care of himself.  

His Grandmother’s funeral was schedule to be 4 days before my research project hand in date; the problem with this is that I still needed to get everything printed and do final editing and the funeral was happening on the other side of the country, This was a 200 page research project; I worked my ass off to get everything together beforehand, so that I could go with him, but in the end I didn’t have the time and the reality was that I was editing and adding to the project up until 2 days before my hand in. I did skype with him in the mornings and evenings so we could talk about how he was doing. 

After the funeral he returned home, but he was incredibly sad. After my hand in I tried to talk with him about it, he showed me some pictures and I read the eulogy that his sister read at the funeral, I cried a bit after reading the eulogy, and that’s when my boyfriend got angry, he said that I didn’t have a right to cry or be upset because it was his grandmother and because I had chosen to forego the funeral. 

Things have just gone down hill since then; it’s been 2 months. On top of my research project, I also had my regular work to finish over the past 2 months; it’s just been a very busy time in my life. My boyfriend went through a similar experience the year before, where I helped and supported him through his work, and he tried to help me and support me through mine, but the entire time he was cold and distant, and at one point he even admitted to me that he didn’t want to help me, and he couldn’t be bothered. 

So this all came to a head recently, when I confronted him about how he’s been distant and the way he has been treating me (ignoring me all day, being rude, distant and sometime downright nasty to me) He basically said he can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, and he doesn’t think he ever will. At this point I will admit that I lost it, I was put in a situation where I had to choose between my relationship and my education and it’s only in hindsight that I see it. I was so overwhelmed and upset that I hit my head against the wall, hard and screamed, but only because I’ve never been in so much emotional pain in my life, I didn’t know how to handle it so I handled it poorly. 

Since then things have not gotten better; we’ve tried to talk it over calmly, but a few days ago he lost it and went on this rant about how terrible his life is and how hurt he is. There is a lot more going on with his family than I knew, including that his father used to beat him badly and his grandmother would protect him, I never knew this about his father, though I knew they had an incredibly strained relationship. I’ve suggested therapy but he had said he’s not up for it. 

We talked about a solution and he thinks I need to go back to my home country by myself for a few weeks and be with my family, and to leave him alone for that time so that he can think and mourn alone. He also said that he is thinking about moving out of our flat at the end of the summer, to go live with some friends, but he said that he wants us to stay together. 

I think at this point that the relationship might be over; I don’t know how to show him that I’m sorry I missed the funeral, but there was no other option for me. I love this guy so much, but if this is how our relationship is going to be, I don't think I can do it. I need perspective on this issue; maybe some advice on how to apologise properly? and if not maybe some advice on how to end a long term relationship? 


EDIT: A lot of people have been mentioning this; I did ask for an extension from my academic advisor, and he told me that the school does not grant extensions under any circumstances. The way my University handles mitigating circumstances for graduate projects is that they expect you to turn in whatever work you have completed by the deadline, and then they allow you to resubmit the completed project at the next grading cycle, however this would mean that I would not be allowed to graduate this year, and would have to wait until the next graduation cycle.

Also I should mention that we usually return to my home country for a few weeks in the summer to visit my family, a trip wasn't planned or set for this summer but we had discussed a possibility of it, that's why it's not a completely unreasonable request that I go home for a while. 


TLDR; my boyfriend can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?"
