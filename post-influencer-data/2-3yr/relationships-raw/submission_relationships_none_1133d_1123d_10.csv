"UPDATE: I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me &amp; I don't know how to handle this.

Again, I am overwhelmed by the support and love I've received from everyone. It feels great to be comforted and cheered on by you all. Thank you **so much**.

So, husband cheated. He has been since ""maybe two weeks before last Christmas"", according to him.

I was very calm when confronting him and took the advice many of you gave me by telling him that he needs to explain to me who Roxy is and why she is his ""best friend"" on Snapchat. His face gave him away immediately but he still tried to lie to me at first. 

He said that she works with his friend and they met when his friend invited her out to lunch with the two of them. At first, he claimed he only met her about two months ago. He said that they're ""best friends"" because he doesn't receive many snapchats from others and she is extremely active on the app. He said she just sends randoms and is really into fitness, so she sends a lot of ""inspirational"" snaps on being healthy and living a better life. He said that every once in a while, he'll send her something back, like a picture of a cheeseburger or something just to tease her about her level of health-consciousness.

First, I asked why he didn't just tell me about her. He said he didn't even think about it because she's just an acquaintance, not even a friend. Then I asked if he'd ever received anything even remotely inappropriate from her.

He answered with, ""Not on purpose"". I'm assuming he went with that because he knew I opened that snapchat and he probably knew it was a bad one.

I asked what ""Not on purpose"" means. He got very defensive. Started raising his voice and saying he doesn't need to explain what that means, that sometimes people accidentally send the wrong snapchats to the wrong people. Then he had the nerve to say something along the lines of, ""I feel like I'm on trial here. People warned me that you'd get crazy when you're pregnant but I never thought it'd be this bad.""

Now. As some of you mentioned in my last post, it seems amazing that I'm able to keep such a level-head. That is because I was raised by a mother who always told me that you *never* accomplish anything with anger. That you can be emotional, passionate, upset, etc. without ever raising your voice. Messages received quietly and concisely are just as loud and clear as messages received through yelling and screaming. That is how I have lived my life for 26 years, with the exception of just a few blow ups (I am human).

This moment was an exception. I didn't exactly yell and scream, but I became furious. For him to try to blame this on me being pregnant? How unoriginal and offensive. Long story short, he said he'd never seen me this crazy and I told him that I'd never seen a picture of another girl's pussy on my husband's snapchat before. He came back with that I shouldn't have looked at his snapchat. I came back with that it was an accident but even if it hadn't been, there shouldn't be any reason he's receiving snapchats like that for me to see- accidentally or not- in the first place. I told him that I may be pregnant but I'm also an intelligent person and I am his *wife*, so I knew he was lying and I deserved to know the truth. I asked if I could see his text messages to see if he's been texting Roxy. He said sure. No messages. Then I asked to see his Facebook messages. He looked like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He told me no. I asked why.

He finally broke and started to cry. Told me he couldn't let me see the messages because they would hurt me. Because they were inappropriate. 

Then it all came out. They screwed in the backseat of her car the **first** night they met.

This is already long so I'll spare you all the details. But it's been an ongoing affair for months. No, they did not always use protection. Although I was recently screened for STIs, I'll be getting checked again in light of this information.

My uncle already assured me that if he was unfaithful, we would cream him in court. Really the only thing I'm willing to fight him tooth &amp; nail for is our home; I put a lot of effort and money into making this home my dream space. I won't be seeking spousal support but I will seek child support. 

I'm obviously heartbroken and told him to go stay in a hotel or with Roxy for all I cared (I confronted him last night). My mom &amp; sister stayed with me last night and let me sob all over them for hours. Right now I'm sort of numb but I'm also thinking very clearly. I know what my next 10 moves are and I feel supported and secure in my decision to leave him and keep my baby.

A few things I just wanted to clarify: My husband is not a lawyer; his good friend is. There was some concern for my success in court if my husband is a lawyer. His friend is in environmental law so, while I'm sure he can provide some advice, he will not be my husband's divorce lawyer.

There were suggestions of me terminating my pregnancy. I fully support the right to choose and I would probably terminate the pregnancy if I was in a different financial position and lacked a support system. However, I work as a marketing manager for a large company. Not only does this allow me the privilege of working from home about 50% of the time, but it also grants me financial independence. I do not rely on my husband for money and I really never have. He works in tech so, while he makes a good salary, I will have no need for spousal support. I have a phenomenal support system; this baby will be loved so dearly by so many. Yes, I will have to deal with my husband for the rest of my life if I have this child and it will make future relationships for me more difficult, but it is worth it. I've wanted this baby since day one and I am her mother, which means that I am strong enough to raise her alone because I *have* to be strong enough.

Here's to hoping for a speedy divorce. I'm ready to be done with this marriage. Which is crazy because just a few days ago I thought my life was as close to perfect as you could get.

**tl;dr** Husband admitted to an affair. I will be proceeding with a divorce and will keep our baby. I'm numb but calm and feeling good about my decisions and how I handled the situation. I know there is a long road ahead of me and this will all probably *really* hit me soon. When it does, I'll mourn and grieve the end of what I had thought was a happy union. Right now I'm in self-preservation mode and much more focused on how to come out of this in the best position possible. Thank you so much for all the advice and support, Reddit!

**Edit:** Formatting

**UPDATE:** I know it has been only a short time since I posted this update but I need to tell you all how amazing all of you are. Wow, this much support is just... wow. I wish I could reply to all of your comments and messages but because of the volume, I'm just going to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and every one of you who read my posts, who commented, thought of me, wished my baby &amp; me the best, messaged me, and anything else. I am currently at my parent's condo, sitting outside at their pool, sunbathing my little baby bump and reading each and every one of your amazing and empowering comments. I just want you all to have that image; that **you** have made me happy and content in a time when I am short on both. This is proof that love does exist, even if it doesn't within my, now over, relationship. And that is a powerful thing. 

Love to you all.


**Me again:** I was going to post more details on what happened during the confrontation with my husband, etc., but then I decided against it. I should keep some details private; it's likely my husband has seen this post. 

I will leave you with this:

My dad and I were up late talking last night and, as usual, he had the perfect thing to say to me. He told me that weak people are afraid of strong people. He told me to keep on terrifying the weak ones. That way, the only people who won't fear you are the bravest, strongest of people and those are the people who are worthy of you.

Then he said my husband is a spineless turd who couldn't kick it with the strongest woman in the world.

Just thought I'd leave you with that and encourage everyone to ""be terrifying"" by being strong and not standing for nonsense.

This is the last I will post on the matter. I have a lot ahead of me with everything and will probably go quiet on Reddit for a while. Time to get ready for court and to ""be terrifying"". :)

Thank you, thank you, thank you again. Love to all of you and best wishes.

Love,

"I [26f] opened my husband's [32m] snapchat and it was a very explicit picture and caption from a girl. He's sitting not 20 feet from me &amp; I don't know how to handle this.


Well, title kind of says it all. Throwaway because my husband is active on Reddit. He's probably on it now.

Here goes: I've been with my husband for 5 years, married for 1.5. I've never *once* doubted his fidelity. He's great. Super smart, funny, handsome, and, I **thought**, loyal. He's never given me reason to doubt him or be suspicious.

I thought it was kind of odd when he downloaded snapchat; he's not big on social media. I have one, but I'm not very active. We rarely snap each other. He said his friends were really active and he liked it better than Facebook, so. As I said, I've never had any reason not to trust him. So I thought nothing of it. 

This morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said ""Mom"". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named ""Roxy"". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said ""I want your tongue inside me again"".

Now. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are ""best friends"". **WTF**.

I feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.

Here's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.

He's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. 

**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby &amp; me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She ""stalked"" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting). I told him it was urgent; we are meeting tomorrow morning. I will try to update as much as I can and from the bottom of my heart, thank you all again, Internet strangers!

"UPDATE: me [14f] with school it starts tomorrow and I have no friends in my lunch


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5026qi/me_14f_with_school_it_starts_tomorrow_and_i_have

First off- thank you SO much for all the nice comments and stories of being alone in lunch. It made me feel so much better!

This is a really happy update!

I ate lunch outside today and I was sitting alone when four girls approached me. They had that they had all moved from different states and countries, and asked if they could sit with me. I was prepared to eat alone or approach some people like you guys said- so this was a relief! 

Of course I said yes! And we really hit it off. We walked around the school after we were done and chatted. We made a group chat and agreed to sit together again tomorrow!

They're all really nice and I think we're going to be good friends.

I'm really glad I made some new friends- I'm not that scared of high school anymore!

The only bad thing that happened is I lost my textbook! I looked everywhere for it but it's gone. I don't even know where I left it... I feel awful and hope my teacher isn't mad. :(

But all in all it was a great day- thank you for all the nice wishes!!!

TLDR: lunch went great- four girls sat down with me and we are friends now. Sitting with them again tomorrow. I did however, lose a textbook the same day it was given to me and feel awful... 

Edit: thanks for all the nice comments! I was told not to worry about the textbook and got a new one :)"
"I [38M] personally took care of my aged father [75]and inherited most of his money after he died. Now my siblings [42F, 45F, 50F, 48M] are accusing me of manipulation and theft

"Erm, my girlfriend [22F] has an issue with the fact that I [26M] walk to work


I feel like I'm going crazy so I just wanted to check whether I'd somehow completely misjudged this.

Literally the only thing to explain here - I've been seeing my girlfriend for 3 months, exclusively for 2. I don't drive as I graduated university and moved to London, where a car isn't needed, and have only just moved back to my more rural hometown.

 I'm currently working in an office which is slightly awkwardly located - if I get the bus, it's two separate buses so the journey takes a total of about 55 minutes. If I walk, it's 1h10m.

I enjoy walking a lot when it isn't raining, and I take quite a scenic route, so I enjoy getting my headphones in with spotify and just enjoying the stroll in the mornings and evenings. I enjoy it more than a cramped bus and find it to be relaxing and a fresh start to the day.

I mentioned in passing that I walk to work to my girlfriend and she keeps bringing it up, saying that if I don't drive I should 'stop being weird' and get public transport like everyone else. She thinks it's too long to just walk each day and she ""just finds it weird"". She said she would be too embarrassed to tell her friends that I walk to work.

That's all I can explain, there's no real other reason but she genuinely seems to have an issue with it.

Am I missing something here? Has she just got a weird problem with the concept of walking? 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I walk to work each day and my girlfriend appears to be struggling with the concept. "
"My (26/F) boyfriend (28/M) has become suspiciously close to a model (26/F) he photographs, and has a practically naked photo of her as the wallpaper on his phone.


Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. 

He's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. 

This is actually how we met. 

I modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. 

That was, until, Rachel came into the picture. 

I've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. 

That said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. 

The lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. 

They also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. 

I'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. 

Rachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. 

The real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. 

Rachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. 

I really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. 

He has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just ""kindred"" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. 

Am I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? 

TL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? 

**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.

**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. 

**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. 

In any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. 


**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** 
 [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)

First of all, I’d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. 

Second, I’d like to address a few things: 

1. My boyfriend — sorry, ex boyfriend — has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That’s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. 

2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I’ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that … but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they’ll find other ways to cheat.

3. I’m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just … yeah.

Okay, now for the good stuff! … or I guess, the bad stuff. 

I met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you’ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, “What’s going on between you and Rachel?” His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, “DO NOT bullshit me.” 

I tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer … ? 

Yeah, I’m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I’m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.

He could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I’d had a switchblade on me, I can’t say for certain I wouldn’t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.

Kidding. Totally kidding.  

We met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or … I don’t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!

I asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. 

The moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn’t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. 

**BARF.**

They kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. 

They had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.

And they’ve been fucking ever since. 

He mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don’t care. I’m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don’t know why or how. I didn’t ask and I don’t care to know.

Funnily enough, Ian said he doesn’t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he’s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. 

I literally said that.  

In any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. 

My friends and family, and most of Ian’s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she’s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she’s always there for me. 

For real, you guys, I’m going to miss his family. They’re good people. The best people. 

This is my first “adult” breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you’re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you’ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it’s … well, it’s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.

So, that’s the conclusion to this story. That’s what happened. 

Thank you again to everyone. 

If I have anything to add, I’ll do so below.

TL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.

**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* 

**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys.

"[Update] Too soon to tell my [27m] girlfriend [28f] I love her after 3 months?


da op: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xnc5y/too_soon_to_tell_my_27m_girlfriend_28f_i_love_her/



I ended up getting sick during my flight back so my big plans kind of collapsed and we just stayed in Friday night. She was taking care of me so sweetly, and when we were lying in bed together I felt so happy I just had to tell her. She said for her this is really serious thing and she needs some time, but wasn't weirded out or feeling pressured or anything, and instead was happy. I was perfectly fine with that and mentally accepted that 'OK, if things keep going well I can wait however many more weeks or months it takes her to feel comfortable saying it.' 


We spent a romantic weekend mostly just cuddlin' and fuckin' and taking nice walks. Monday morning when she was getting on the bus to work and we were parting ways she said 'Goodbye, I love you' so matter of factly and out of nowhere my heart almost exploded. I was going around with the goofiest smile plastered across my face all day and wanted to sing and dance in the rain. Happiest I've ever been in my life. 



TL;DR: She loves me back and the whole world is roses and sunshine! :D Thanks for reassuring me it wasn't freakily-too-soon"
"UPDATE: My [32F] mom [72F] kept saying my kid was obese. The crazy ran even deeper than I thought.


Hi Reddit. I'm back with an update. Here's the original post. https://redd.it/4zn8ly

Thanks for all the responses you gave me on my first post. I think I needed a dose of reality, and that's what I got. 

After reading all the comments I realized I needed to talk to my mom. So when she came over, before she had a chance to say anything about Leah's eating habits, I took her aside and said ""enough. Leah is healthy and happy, and your weight comments are inappropriate. They stress me out and they're bad for Leah. If you keep making them, we're just not going to see you anymore."" She sputtered a bit, but ultimately agreed to my terms. I was hopeful that maybe she would actually stop making the comments so we could have a somewhat normal relationship and she could continue to see Leah.

Hahaha.

I work a part-time schedule of two days per week and every other weekend. This was my working weekend, so my husband was home with Leah. When I got home after work on Sunday, I could tell something was up. Leah was already in bed, and my husband looked really tense. He's usually a pretty laid back guy, so this was weird. 

When I asked what was up, he said we needed to talk about my mother. I had told him that I had spoken with her and that she had been warned not to make any more comments about Leah's weight. Well, apparently she just couldn't do it, because she called him (knowing I was at work) that day and told him that I was blind to Leah's problem and that he needed to get involved because I had confided in her that Leah's pediatrician told me she was at serious risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and that we needed to change her diet so she would lose weight.

What?!?

For the record, Leah's pediatrician has never said anything like that. In fact, as I mentioned in my last post, he has told me that she is underweight. Fortunately, my husband a) attends all Leah's doctor appointments and b) has the sense to realize that a rail-thin child isn't edging toward obesity, so he knew it was bunk. He told my mom that she wasn't to call again until she heard from me.

Well, I was livid. It was like after years and years of weight-related crap from my mom something finally snapped. I called her and the minute she said ""hello"" I just lit into her. I told her that based on her behavior she was either delusional or a manipulative sociopath, and that either way she wasn't allowed around me or my kid again. I told her she was not welcome to call, e-mail, come over or send cards. Basically, we were going to pretend like she didn't exist. I hung up before she had a chance to get a word in edgewise.

She called fifteen times that night. I finally blocked her number on my cell and my husband's (we don't have a landline so this means she can't call us at all). I had three emails in my inbox the next morning, which I deleted without reading before blocking her email address as well. Finally, we had given her a key to our house for emergency purposes so first thing yesterday I had the locks changed then took Leah out for the day. Lo and behold, when we came home my neighbor said that my mom (she recognizes her because she used to come over a lot) had been banging on the door for almost half an hour earlier that day before storming off in a huff. I can only imagine how angry she was when she realized her key didn't work anymore.

I feel better than I have in years, which makes me think I did the right thing. The only thing I'm still struggling with is how to break the news to Leah. She really does love grandma. My husband and I are going to sit down with her tonight, so I guess I have until then to figure out what to say.

"Boyfriend 30M of 2.5 years, avoiding our (27F) favorite dinner spot, and not going to a movie. This also conveniently happens to be when a girl he's been chatting with on Facebook is going to dinner/movie. Am I totally crazy?


Wow this is a doozy. Sorry the title is kind of a doozy, I'm feeling a little bit crazy and I need to be talked away from the hypothetical crazy ledge.

My boyfriend really likes Facebook. I have had no reason to not trust him 100% with it. He's definitely a like every photo/status kind of guy and just thinks that it is fun. I don't have a facebook, and my presence on his is nonexistent besides the mention of fun things we are doing here and there. I realize now that I could easily be mistaken for a friend/sister/cousin/etc. 

About 3 months ago, I got tipped off from a friend that he had been a little flirty with a girl on Facebook. I did a quick cyber stalk of her and she was gorgeous, and I noticed instead of the typical like he had been ""loving"" and ""wowing"" her pictures. I called him and told him I felt a little bit crazy, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any funny business. He assured me he is just being nice, and they've never met (she is a friend of a friend apparently?) and it is no different then me upvoting something on Reddit. They had messaged a few times but it was totally innocent and looks any flirtations were nonexistent. Ok, I dropped it, but my spidey senses told me to bookmark it, instead of completely discard the thought of her forever.

A new movie is coming out tonight, and conveniently our favorite dive bar/dinner spot is RIGHT across from the movie theater. We just have to walk a few feet or so and there we are. We have both been stoked for his movie, and talking up our date night ALL week.

I was going into a work meeting and texted him ""Hey I'll probably be tied up till after 5, so i'll see you at *name of place* at 7!"" 

He texts me back (verbatim, to show how weird this was). ""Hey umm is there somewhere else?"" 

I don't know what it was, but after a few months of not even thinking of this mysterious facebook enigma, something shouted at me to look at her profile. Her profile is absolutely 100% open, there is no privacy. She geotagged how excited she was to see the movie and go to the bar. Hmm....Ok that is a little convenient. Did a little more digging, he's loved even more of her pictures.

Shortly after, he asks if we can just have a night in (which is weird, because my place is being remodeled and the only access at my house is the bathroom and bedroom, and he just had his fumigated and is staying at his moms). I'm like where da fuh are we staying in at?? I have already bought the movie tickets and I told him that I didn't want them to go to waste so to please come we can go eat at another nearby place.

I just think this is all awfully convenient. Am I being a total loon in thinking he doesn't want his girlfriend and side piece running into each other at the movie/dinner?
  

Update!!!: first of all, you guys rock. It is nice to have an army of wonderful Internet friends. So long story short. After the movie I went to the bathroom and Facebook girl was also in there. I told her I loved her hair and then we were just girl chatting, and I was chatting with her out of the door where my boyfriend was waiting for me. He looked like he was going to faint. I was like ""babe! Meet my new friend!"" He was cheating on me with her. They had been having sex for a few months, and he said he was just in a casual relationship with me. Right a casual relationship with a house being built and joint finances???? Good hell. She told me since I have fake boobs I just wasn't enough for him and that was her justification for being ok with it, because I have fake boobs. It was weird like she knew who I was when we were chatting in the bathroom. So no damn girl power there. He didn't even seem sorry, which sucked because he really was my best friend. I don't make a lot of friends since I'm a trauma nurse and just don't get out much. I'm really sad, and feeling really stressed out and just broken. I also feel yucky, I'll get checked for STIS and all that jazz on monday. Time to fix this heartbreak. I took the weekend off of work. Ugh this sucks. Thanks guys you are all so wonderful and encouraging!

"Me [26F] with my husband [27M] of 2 years, starting to resent my husband for convincing me to have a small wedding.


Throwaway because he is a pretty avid redditor.


I've always dreamed of a big wedding, not extravagant to any extreme, but that's just how all my family and friends' weddings have been and ever since I was a little girl I knew that's what I wanted. 


My husband is very pragmatic and from the start was very critical of the wedding I'd planned in my head. We debated what we'd do pretty extensively and I thought came to some really good compromises. I always wanted a really great photographer, he thought hiring a photographer at all was pointless, so our compromise was asking a friend to be our photographer as his wedding gift to us. I always wanted a big, Saturday night party reception, he wanted a courthouse wedding with just us, so our compromise was a Sunday brunch with select friends and family. I always wanted my sister as my MOH and my two BFFs from growing up as bridesmaids, he, again, just wanted the two of us, so our compromise was my father got to walk me down the aisle. I wanted a band, he doesn’t like dancing, so our compromise was me making a playlist of background music for the brunch.


The day was wonderful and I was so happy and it really was such an awesome wedding. 


Then my brother got married.


He had, basically, my dream wedding. Ever since then, the resentment has been growing steadily. All of our friends and family were there and everyone had the absolute best time. It hands down was a better day for me than my wedding day. It was such a beautiful celebration of not only the love between my brother and my new sister-in-law, but of them as a couple and everyone they loved enough to include in their special day. My grandfather read a prayer, she had a first dance with her father, they had beautiful flowers and a killer band, everyone danced all night, including my husband!! 


The real kicker was her dress. If I had to pick out the dress of my dreams, it was what she wore. When she came out everyone gasped and my husband actually said, “wow”. It broke my heart. I wanted that moment for myself so badly, I know that makes me sound like a shallow attention queen, but it’s true. I had actually picked out a discount dress for my own wedding, but my husband said it was probably too fancy for the venue, so I went with a white sundress. 


The wedding was awhile ago and they just uploaded the album to facebook and I sat there going through it sobbing. Our friend did take a few nice photos of the day, but it was nothing like what they had. Theirs had captured so many beautiful moments throughout the day, beautiful pictures of them and everyone who I loved but was unable to even have at my wedding. 


I know this is such a stupid issue, and it’s not like he did anything wrong since we did come to logical compromises that I fully agreed with at the time, but I have been feeling more and more resentful and I don’t know what to do about it.


EDIT: Wow, okay I get it. Thanks for the overwhelming feedback. I am being superficial and shallow, he was definitely right. I'm going to do my best to forget about it completely and be grateful for the compromises he was willing to make.

"My [19M] girlfriend [19F] of 6 months has a problem that my sister [17F] is technically an adopted cousin.


So she was adopted by my uncle and his partner (two dads). My mom helped them raise her a lot and she was her female role model as she was growing up. Three years ago, my uncle and his partner died in an accident and my mom adopted her. I always loved her like a sister and after she was adopted we just started calling each other brother and sister. She calls my mom, mom too.

So my girlfriend was talking to her and I was there too. At that time she didn't know any of the above. She just thought we're biological siblings. My girlfriend mentioned that she looks more like my mom than I do. My sister answered that we're technically cousins and our mom isn't her biological mother, she's her aunt. My girlfriend said something like ""even so, you still have probably have a lot of the same genes"" and my sister said she was adopted so they just look alike randomly. I remember my gf saying ""oh so you two aren't even biologically cousins?""...

So yesterday she tells me that she it's weird that I'm close with my sister when we're really adopted cousins which really means just friends. I was a little shocked and told her that she's family, not just a friend. Our lack of biological connection doesn't matter at all in my opinion but she thinks it makes a huge difference because we don't have the safeguards that evolution has put in place. I don't even know what that means. She ended the conversation and asked me to think about it. 

All I can say is what the hell? What does she expect from me? Tell her that my sister isn't my sister? What should I say to her?

"My [35F] Niece [16F] always jokes about how her mum [40F] used to beat me up. Doesn't know it was actually serious abuse


UPDATE -  sorry can't change title

Original thread [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ybnur/my_35f_niece_16f_always_jokes_about_how_her_mum/)
  
THank you so much everyone! I never thought I'd ever need advice here myself, even though I felt confident about asking because I read this subreddit whenever I wander over to reddit and found people to be measured and supportive, sometimes to my surprise. Thanks again.

There's a bit of an update (nothing dramatic). But first I just wanted to clarify a few things. Apparently I caused some confusion about the terms I used. Sarah is the daughter of my mother's sister. My first cousin. Where I'm from, we don't have a word for 'first cousins'. We call them sisters/brothers etc. So I refer to Eloise as my 'niece' because that's the term we use. I know what cousins are in English, but I didn't know about the 'once / twice removed etc' . I speak English well, but complex genealogy in English goes over my head.  Sorry for the confusion.

Second, after all these comments, I started doubting myself a little bit (even though previously I was 100% sure nothing was going on abuse-wise in Sarah's home). I had a few conversations in depth with my other cousins and sisters. We know Sarah has mental problems and they are a lot closer to her than me (we don't talk outside these family trips, even then it's smallest of small talk, despite my forgiveness).

THey are certain that Eloise is 100% the golden child as someone termed. I'm convinced that Sarah in her craziness, has clung to Eloise as her beacon of hope or maybe as an extension of her past dreams. Or maybe to make up for her shitty parents who just left Sarah behind when she was young and injured. 

I honestly think the only thing that keeps Sarah from being institutionalised, is Eloise. We are grateful that by some stroke of luck, ELoise didn't turn out to be an asshole, considering how spoiled she is. 

She has complete freedom to do whatever she wants for the most part, large allowance for a girl her age (Sarah is not rich by any means, just the greatest proportion of any free money is spent on Eloise. Also I know she sacrificed a lot for Eloise. There are rumours in the family that she used to be a call girl in order to get her into a good school. But it's just rumours from third parties. I don't believe it, but I don't have trouble believing she would do that and more in a heartbeat if it was necessary for Eloise). 

THe girl is nearly perfect (when she isn't going on about designers or some kardashian thing). She doesn't act out, stay out late (even though she can), is so prudent with money, she can indulge her designer fetish regularly while buying me and her favourite uncle super thoughtful gifts. She gets excellent grades and has lots of friends. She is very open, to the point of oversharing and I have been obsessively looking for red flags since I met her.

I'm convinced Eloise is safe with Sarah. 

However I'm a little worried about their relationship when Eloise goes to college in a few years though. I've advised Eloise to move out to dorms in college and maybe go to study in America (I offered to help pay for it), because she's young and adventurous. I worry Sarah might cling to her a little bit or maybe go off the rails when she finds herself in an empty house. But my priority is Eloise and making sure she doesn't miss out on opportunities just to keep her mum sane.

I will never understand how someone so mentally unstable can produce such a well put together child. 

I know Sarah was 16 when she did what she did, disrupted from a young age and having suffered some quite insane trauma when she was really young (sorry, it's too specific to even put it in vague terms, it was really a big deal), but I know she has changed a lot in some ways (no aggression, no more confrontations with relatives etc). Maybe she's on medication. She did seem a little sedate these last few years. But considering she apparently doesn't feel remorse about what she did to me (because she casually brings it up in family discussion - albeit a crazily sanitised version). 

All I can hope for is that she keeps it together for another two years the way she has. I will keep an eye on Eloise and maybe try to be close to her in adulthood too.

As for talking to ELoise about the jokes. The advice ranged from telling Eloise to stop in very vague terms to demonstrating it to her using a model of the stick I was beaten with (ahem, yeah no). I had decided I wasn't going to traumatise her and she loves her mother dearly, I didn't need to mess with that either. 

If she's ever in danger, I have no problems bringing every detail up to her and the police if necessary. But for now she's a happy kid who loves her mum and the only drama in her life seems to be on TV. 

I had a skype call with her. Just our regular chats if we see each other online. 

I wasn't going to bring it up to her unless she made another joke. But she's quite smart and has noticed that I was a bit off last time we talked and she asked me what was wrong. SHe had no clue it was her jokes that made me uncomfortable. I just said a combination of what pkalef and Megatrain suggested. Esssentially that jokes about what happened between her mum and me brings up painful memories and I don't like it being brought up. Told her that I know she's joining in the family spirit, but I would like it to stop. She was immediately upset. She had never done any wrong by me before and I quickly reassured her by saying it wasn't her and she had no way of knowing. She asked me what really happened and I said I'm invoking aunty privilege and to just let it go. SHe said she would. I made her promise absolutely not to bring it up with her mum. It's the only way I can feel comfortable coming back to the country to visit, Things have to stay as they are. SHe promised. 

She also had been wondering over the years if there were ever issues between me and her mum, as I never stay at their house, but always at my sisters or other cousins. I said ""yes, there are issues, but we can manage to be friendly."" We talked some more. I asked her if she ever had problems with her mom. 

She said yes of course. Sometimes she won't let her do things and she described a few things (like get a tattoo or go to Thailand alone with some girls - yeah wtf, of course not). There were others, all of them inane. I asked her if Sarah ever did anything that worried her. She said no, and that she knows she has a good mom and she can talk to her about anything, she knows other girls who can't do that or that it's rare for girls to be so close to their moms. So she's grateful.

She talked some more. Said I was her favourite relative (hell yeah, suck on that previously favourite uncle!). Then she added, ""I promise not to tell her, but whatever mom did, I'm sure she's very sorry she's hurt you. You know she likes you a lot, she's always proud of what you've done in [other country] and that I should be more like you"".

I like to think I kept a poker face at that one. I just said 'sure' and we said our goodbyes for the day.

So there you have it. Not much of a big update. Thanks everyone for helping me put it into words.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Re-examined any clues Eloise is abused. Convinced there's none. Will continue to keep an eye out over the years. Suggested Eloise leave home and study abroad in 2 years. Think Sarah might get clingy or fall apart afterwards, but who cares. The difficulty with her jokes came up during skype call. Said it caused painful memories and didn't want to talk about it. That's all. She promised not to ask her mom about it. She thinks whatever must have happened between us, her mom must be very sorry. I lol'ed on the inside."
"My family is calling my older brother [28M] and I [24M] selfish, because we refuse to share his whealth with them to keep them from becoming homeless. I'm starting to feel guilty and have doubts?


Typo *wealth* 

There are quite a few of us in this family (34, 31, 29, 28, 26, 22, 20, 16 &amp; 15) and I am 24. Our parents started when they were very young, to put it lightly. One of my older brothers Ashton (28) is a very successful business owner and makes a lot more money than any of us make in a year at our jobs. He enjoys buying pricey things for himself, and frequently spends quite some money on me, and our two youngest siblings Macy (16) and Danny (15). He gives me my own portion of his money to save/spend whenever I want. He does favor us three out of all of our siblings, and doesn't attempt to hide it from everyone else. 

Our parents were abusive toward him during his childhood, and our other siblings, even some of the younger ones kinda followed along with them when they became older. This followed him into adulthood (not the physical abuse), but being excluded from family events and talking about him behind his back. We were both particularly close throughout our childhood, as well as when our baby siblings came along we became very protective of them.

Of course when he began to become successful and earn more money is when everyone began treating him well. Our parents are still trying to pay off debt and most of our siblings are either still living at home or struggling to pay their bills. Ashton doesn't help them at all, which I understand. I currently live with him, as well do Macy and Danny (who got removed and placed with us due to neglect/abuse).

I've gotton calls and many texts from the family telling me that we're selfish, a ""disgrace""to the family, we ""stole"" their kids,  and that even if Ashton doesn't help, I should at least lend some money to them so they don't become homeless (that's how bad their financial situation is at the moment).

I have been feeling guilty about all this honestly (a fault of mine is being way too empathtic) I'm starting to wonder if I am being selfish? What if they do become homeless, then what do I do...just leave them out there? I don't expect Ashton to help them and with good reason, but how do I get rid of my guilt and not cave in....

So this year I have to take a physical science so I can graduate since I didn't pass freshman year. My teacher seemed cool at first, he was funny and made the class alright but he was an asshole right from the beginning. I should mention this is an ED class (I was in and out of psych hospitals for suicide attempts freshman and sophomore year which is why I failed so I have an IEP) so there are like 5 other kids. He was a dick to all of them, basically implying that they're stupid (some girl answers a question correctly and he goes ""wow, look who took their smart pills today."" Or ""put your thinking caps on. I know some of you have misplaced them so you can share."" ""This object is iron, like the plate in [Name]'s head"") and is just really rude. For some reason I was his favorite though, I gave like two correct answers on the first day and he acted like I was a genius. 

It got weird when he asked us what we wanted to be after school. I said I was considering mortuary science school, and he literally started calling me Morticius which isn't even a fucking word. He refused to call me by my name and would make up weird rhymes like ""Morticius so Delicious"" which was freaking creepy. 

I got contacts a month ago, and he would talk about how I was so much prettier with glasses and he preferred them and the contacts didn't make me look right and blah blah blah. One day I had had enough and was literally like ""why are you commenting on my physical appearance? You're a teacher."" And everyone went ""ooooooohhhh"" and he was like ""I don't have a response for that"" and laughed and went back to the lesson (he was talking about me in the middle of a lesson). I was pretty sick of being the teachers pet for no reason so I switched to a different teacher. When my counselor asked why I told her all of this and she was visibly upset and asked for his name and said she would talk to him. Apparently she called my mom because my mom was FUMING when I got home and my dad wants to kick his ass. 

I think the counselor already handled it but my parents want to go down to my school and make a scene. I don't want them too, it isn't a big deal since I switched out and I don't think it's fair to make someone lose their job because their an asshole and I don't have to deal with him anymore so I'm unbothered. Should I keep telling them to leave it since the counselor handled it or let them go to my school?

Tl;dr science teacher is creepy, parents are out for blood but the counselor handled it. What do?


Edit just wanted to let everyone know I'm reading all of this I'm in school rn and I will answer later 


Edit 2 so I just got home and wow thank you everyone! Its good to know I did the right thing. But everyone is calling me brave and stuff when honestly I accidentally said the first thing that popped in my head. I'm glad it worked at lease. I guess I need to tell my parents to go to the school board because you guys are right, some of the kids in his class are little freshman and don't deserve the way he treats them. He's really really rude. My problem now is ever since the counselor said something to him I've literally been scared to pass his classroom. So our school is set up by alphabet and numbers up to 10. So his room is G5 and my 5th period class is G3 and I don't even want him to see me. I guess that says a lot. I'll probably make an update when my parents talk to the principal or whoever. Thank you all so much, you've helped a lot! ❤️❤️"

"I[27m] broke up with my girlfriend[26f], yet she still maintains on social media that we are in a relationship, and tells every girl I try to date that I am cheating


My ex-girlfriend and I dated for six months. Initially I was worried about things, I found out from just conversations that she slept around a lot. However, she would frame it all as it wasn't her fault because the guys she ran into just ""used her for sex"" that they wanted a relationship but they didn't. 

But over time she shared stories about how she fucked a guy because he had a huge dick, about some guy that was a star college basketball player. And in general she would be very manipulative that she didn't get her way. But what through me off and what really ended up making our relationship last so much longer is that she was very affectionate, and made me really feel like I was the best boyfriend in the world being with her. Eventually I did end things. 
 
It did not go down well, she begged me to stay, told me that she thought we were going to get married. Talked about how she has never had a guy treat her so good. I just told her that we aren't on the same page. 

Since then, things have been tense, she still has photos of me everywhere on her social media accounts. And it makes things really awkward, because if I start for example following a new girl on Instagram, and she thinks we are dating, she will private message them that he is in a relationship and not to get in between. I have talked to women that I have been seeing about this, and while they more often than not believe me, this doesn't look good and it causes unnecessary drama. I don't know what to do. I really just want her to forget about me, but I don't know how I can do that. I have blocked her, yet she still stalks my profiles.

"Getting there: I [23 M] met my estranged sister [11 F] for the first time, need advice on how to raise her properly!


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ue078/i_22_m_met_my_estranged_sister_11_f_for_the_first/)

**tl;dr**: I met my estranged little sister who had been brutally abused on a regular basis in the past. I asked for advice on how to take care of her and raise her given this.

***

Decided to log in to thank you folks for the great advice and support I received last month. They were extremely helpful and using them I've managed to greatly improve my relationship with my sister. 

She's settled in very well at home. Even redecorated her room to her liking and is enjoying living in a relaxed environment and being able to make choices (which I imagine wasn't a thing prior to us meeting). She's great when it comes to routines and organization. In fact, I'm surprised at how incredibly easy it is to raise her. There is no need for me to say anything; she helps me with basically everything from cooking to cleaning up to laundry etc. 

It seems like I've gained her trust. I wouldn't say we're very close just yet but she's a lot more affectionate towards me. I can sit next to her and give her hugs now; a month ago that would've frightened her immensely. 

We've been doing a bunch of things which definitely brought us closer. I've taken her to the beaches, the surrounding neighborhood and local places, and Orlando too which is around 50mins drive away. We've also been going to see rocket launches, which is a common pastime unique to this area, so we've kind of made that our special thing. 

She's still reading a lot, 1-2 books a day on some days. I have some national geographics and picture books which she's gone through already, and the rest is engineering books which she doesn't understand but still picks them from my shelf, and asks me to explain it to her which is kind of cute.

She's seeing a therapist every week and I've taken her to a doctor for a medical checkup - she's quite a bit underweight due to malnutrition; some visible scars on her body; no bone damage or internal injuries; everything else alright; doctor said she'll be fine.

School started last week but I can't say she likes it very much. A combination of not being able to fit in with other kids and finding classes very boring has made her reluctant to go. Fortunately she made friends with this other girl from class who seems to be one of the popular ones, so hopefully she can persuade my sister to be more open and outgoing. On top of that, her mother is actually a therapist and she's also been giving me a lot of support. 

All in all, she's doing great. Regular therapy, making some friends and having various hobbies is putting her in the right direction for recovery. I worried a lot last month because she suddenly came into my life but I have everything under control now. Still feels kind of weird to be responsible for another person out of the blue but we'll be fine. 

So with that I'll end the post. Thanks once again to everyone who gave me advice and PM'd me when I needed it the most.

  **tl;dr**: We're a lot closer to each other now. She's making making great strides towards recovery and enjoying her life for the first time. 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice and replies, the PMs, people offering to send me their old e-readers etc. I love this community. Sorry for being rather inactive in the comment section, I was caught up with work the last few days and only just logged in - as with my original post, I do read every comment and even take notes on some of them :p

"My husband [32M] of 4 years expects me [30F] to visit him on his lunch break and have sex with him several days each week. I just can't do it anymore since I had our baby, but he doesn't seem to understand.


My husband and I have always had a very active sex life. It was that way when we first started dating 9 years ago, and that part of our relationship hasn't changed. Still more often than not we manage at least once a day, but many days its more than once. I only say this because I think it's important for you to know that my husband has a very high libido. This is why we've always met over our lunch break for sex for the past 6 years (basically since we moved in together). 

My husband was the one who first initiated this, and it really has always been more of his thing. It's not that I don't enjoy it. It's just I always feel so rushed that it's not so enjoyable, but my husband says it helps him be better at his job and manage stress levels so I've always been happy to keep meeting him over lunch. We've always met at our home for privacy sake; this is an important detail. 

I just recently (3 months ago) gave birth to our first child. I was working before and during my pregnancy, but my husband and I agreed that I would take this year off and just be a mom. 

Even during my pregnancy we kept up our lunch routine. Except for days where I had bad morning sickness, we would met every single day of the week on our lunch breaks, but ever since we resumed our sex life a few weeks ago, I've avoided meeting my husband during his lunch break. 

Lately I just haven't felt very sexy, as I'm still recovering from giving birth and my body isn't what it was before pregnancy. I'm still just not enjoying sex the way I did before or even during my pregnancy and that adds to everything I've been feeling and my tendency to try to avoid it now sometimes.

For another thing, I also don't know what I'm supposed to do with our baby. My husband has asked me to come to his office instead of him coming home like we used to do. He thinks it would be more convenient since apparently he thinks I'm not doing anything all day and have loads of free time to travel across town to visit him, not to mention that he also seems to think I can just ask my mother to babysit or find someone to watch our son that easily each weekday for over an hour. I really don't understand why he doesn't get the fact that it just isn't feasible for me to travel to him alone right now or leave our son for that long. Plus I've told him that I'm just not comfortable having sex in his office, and there's no way I would be. 

To be honest, even when he has come home lately, I just haven't been in the mood. I've tried, but it's so much harder with a baby around that always needs me. We're still having sex almost every day, but my husband has been so irritable and hateful lately because our frequency is down a lot and I haven't been having sex with him on his lunch breaks which he feels he needs to be productive, and his attitude only makes me wants sex even less. 

He's putting so much pressure on me right now to have sex more often with him and specifically on his lunch break that I almost dread being around him or seeing him now, because I know the first thing he will try is to get me to have sex with him. 

I've tried every way I can think of to explain my perspective and my feelings, but he doesn't seem to understand or care. He'll promise to stop pressuring me, but it seems like the next days or even a few hours later he'll go right back to pressuring me to have sex or nagging me about visiting him on his lunch break. Sometimes it makes me want to cry because it makes me feel so awful. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like he hates me or at least resents me because I can't satisfy his need for sex right now. Please give me some advice or tell me what I should do. 

NOTE: I just wanted to thank you all for commenting and trying to help me. After reading through your comments and responding, I've realized that this isn't a healthy relationship for me or my son right now, and I've decided to temporarily move out of our house and into my parents while my husband and I work on these issues in counseling. It makes me sad to have to do this, but I just don't think I can keep living the way we have with no help and a partner who doesn't care at all about my needs or wants. 

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My husband and I used to have a very active sex life before I gave birth which included meeting for lunch to have a quickie. My husband now expects me to travel to him for the afternoon quickies even though I don't really feel like it and it's almost impossible for me to find someone to look after our son. In generally, he's been putting so much pressure on me to increase the frequency of sex to what it was before the baby. I feel like no matter what I say he doesn't understand or care, and I'm at my breaking point. His pressuring me is really wearing me down. I need some help. "
"My [19M] uncle [32M] pushed my sister [15F] into the pool as a prank. She felt humiliated and called him a jerk. Now everyone demands her to apologize. Am I the only one who thinks this is absurd?


This weekend we were having a small party and my uncle pushed my fully clothed sister into the pool for everyone to laugh. It seemed like I was the only one who didn't find it funny except my sister who felt humiliated and was very angry. I helped her out and took her inside and on the way she said to our uncle ""you're a jerk"" and everyone were like totally shocked!

We didn't come back to the party but when everyone left our parents came and told her that she was out of line and that she needs to call our uncle and apologize to him. She doesn't want to.

We don't know what to do. She asked me for advice and I told her that I don't think she should apologize. She told me she'll do it if I think she should but I want some opinion on what we should do here. I think what our uncle did was very disrespectful. She's not 5.

"I [31F] found opened condom wrappers in husbands [35M] underwear drawer. They're ours, but we haven't used them in months, yet the wrappers are wet. Is he cheating?


I'm trying not to freak out.  He's at work right now while I'm at home with our toddler trying to keep it together. I really am. He never seemed like the guy who would ever do this, let alone ever have time to cheat as we're in communication all day long and he comes home right after work, most days I pick him up and drop him off. But I know it's possible. 

I'm 7 months pregnant.  We haven't used those condoms in ages since we began trying for this child, and clearly having sex now we don't use the condoms as we don't need too. 

He was just out of town for 2 days. We didn't speak too much as he was busy with this work conference. When I went to bed the night he left I went to sleep in heavy pj's. I got hot being pregnant and all, so I woke up drowsy and in the dark went to grab boxers in his drawer to sleep in.  I fumbled around all corners of the drawer and only felt bundles of socks, and knowing the condom box is always in there I actually didn't feel it and at that moment briefly thought that was strange. But I was tired, fell back asleep and forgot until now. 

He got home last night, so I went to put laundry away and opened the drawer and the condom box was there. I thought okay maybe I'm crazy, I just didn't feel it that night. But hormones and curiosity got the best of me and I looked in the box and two wrappers were opened and very moist with the lube the condoms stored in. 

My question is, how long would the wrappers stay wet? I mean... I can't imagine them staying wet for almost a year since using them, let alone for 2 days right. 

Talk me off the ledge people, am I being hormonal and irrational, or is this plausible they just stayed moist this long? I can't believe this. He really is the last person I ever thought would do this, even if he used them, maybe it was for masturbation? But no condoms are in garbage cans (yeah, I'm that crazy right now I checked), why go through trouble to hide it if so? 

TL;DR - I found opened and wet condom wrappers in husbands drawer, wondering if that means he has recently used condoms.


**Edit** - He called on his break and I couldn't keep it in.  Conversation was cut short as he's working but he's denying cheating and having used them at all, so no to the masturbation theory. I have no idea what to believe. Can condom wrappers seriously stay that moist and oily feeling in open air for a year!? I don't know what to do.

**Edit updated 2** - Alright folks, I clearly have some problems in my marriage. We spoke again as he told me he couldn't concentrate at work. He told me over and over again he had no idea how they were opened and when and hasn't even looked at or touched the condom box in a year. 

He told me he was offended and how could I accuse him of an affair, how awful that is. I kept repeating what I said, which was ""can you explain why there's opened condom wrappers in your drawer that are still wet/oily?"", I never went nuts, I never said ""you cheated, were over!"" I never said the words cheated even. I just asked him to explain. I told him it's a shocking thing to find, of course I'd ask about it. He kept going on about how I'm ruining his day, how can he possibly continue working, etc. 

Finally I said okay well, I still need to figure out why they're still wet after all this time. And then folks, he goes quiet and weird and says ""okay, well, I used one a couple months ago""...... I asked why he didn't just say that from the beginning. I asked why he used it. He said he put it on,""maybe to masturbate"". Maybe? I asked why he can't just be honest, I could care less if he used them to jerk off, or put a dildo in his ass, but he made me feel crazy even though I spoke very calmly and rationally to him, he denied ever using them, and then suddenly he tells me okay, he did. He also said he used ""one"". I said two were used. He said ""okay maybe it was two"". I said ""just be honest with me, I don't care if you used them to masturbate but you keep half truth telling"". He just wouldn't be totally honest no matter what, it was like pulling teeth. 

So that's where we're at, I'm upset he lied to me with such conviction about never touching them, he may have been embarrassed but to tell me up and down he promises he hasn't used them since me, that he has no idea, that I'm crazy, that's a huge problem. 

Also I am aware immediately thinking your spouse is unfaithful (even if I never told him that) is in itself a problem I need to reflect on. 

Thanks for all your input originally. 

My use of the word ""wet"" when referring to the oily condom wrapper seems to have really struck a cord with some of you. Sorry for ruining your days.

"My [24M] wife [22F] had an affair while I was away for work. We decided to move past it. Now she's pregnant, and we can't agree how to proceed.


**EDIT 2 (Update): I've spoken to a good friend and attorney about it this morning, and he has offered to represent me and work with me on cost. I've decided to move forward with initiating divorce. As I've said, I have forgiven her what she did. But I've also realized that forgiveness doesn't mean that it would be healthy for either of us to remain in the marriage. I can't raise this child. I don't blame the child, but I know that I would resent it every day. Even if my wife agreed to adoption, I know that she would resent me for pressuring her to do it. The fact is, she has made her choice emotionally. We both know what she wants the outcome to be, and the best thing I can do for both of us in the long term is to stick to my guns. If I'm able to get an annulment through the church, fantastic. If not, so be it. I've got a hard time believing that God will not forgive me for this. For now, my attorney has advised me not to tell my wife and instead to collect all evidence I have of the affair first. I'd like to believe that my wife wouldn't try to destroy the evidence, but given what has happened and what is at stake, I'm not going to take the chance. I'll speak to her some time this week, and will ask her to leave.**



**EDIT: Thank you to everyone for your replies. I am going to go ahead and see if I can meet with an attorney tomorrow and find out what I need to do to ensure that I won't be financially responsible for the child. I expect that she will probably be angry and see this as some sort of power move to force her in to adoption. It's clear to me that I could not be happy raising another man's child. It's just too much to ask. I plan to talk to her and tell her that, while I forgive her for the adultery itself, the marriage is doomed. We're at an impasse where one of us has to lose in order for the other one to win. There is no ""half baby"". It's all in or all out. Moreover, it isn't fair to deny the father's child a chance to know he is a father or the child a chance to know who his father is. I don't personally fault him for what happened. I don't know him, he doesn't know me. I question his morals in sleeping with a married woman, but it isn't as if he had any duty or pledged loyalty to me. Its my wife I should be angry with if anything. I can't even manage that. I just want to get this over with and move forward. Thanks again everyone**

I guess I’m looking for advice just as much as a chance to vent. Sorry if this isn’t the place for that. My wife and I have been married for two years, together for four. I work on a river barge, so I spend about a month away from home at a time for work followed by two weeks off. I’ve been doing this for the last year since I got laid off from my other job. I just got back from a job, and found out that my wife has been having an affair with an old boyfriend that recently came back to town. I asked her how many times, and I wish I didn’t. She said she wasn’t sure and that it had been a continual thing. They started talking on Facebook a few months ago, but it had only been “innocent” catching up until this last time I left. This time, they agreed to meet up, and had basically been sleeping together all month while I was away. She said that she had planned to end it when I got back, and knew she had to come clean. She let me look at her Facebook message inbox and text messages for proof, and the messages were consistent with her story and timeline. 

My initial reaction was that the marriage was over. I felt betrayed, hurt, and didn’t think I’d ever be able to trust her again. I work my ass off so that she doesn’t have to work while she’s in school. I felt like being faithful was the least she could do for me. She knew what marriage meant to me long before we took our vows. Both of us are Catholics. We aren’t perfect Catholics by a long shot, but we’re deeply religious. I stressed to her that for me, marriage is a forever commitment. “In sickness and in health” and “till’ death do us part” mean something to me. I told her that I knew I wanted to be with her for the rest of my life, but only if she could promise me that she knew the same thing.

I stayed at a friend’s place for a few days and thought it over. First, I talked to our priest. He reminded me what I signed up for and believed in. Marriage is a forever commitment, and that means being able to forgive and work past problems. He recommended that for now I find work closer to home so I can be with my wife and that we seek marriage counseling either through the church or with a therapist. I also talked to some of the older guys I work with, and it kind of gave me some perspective. A lot of them had gone through the same thing. Some of their marriages survived, and a lot of them didn’t. But all of them agreed that spending long periods away from home at a time can be rough on any marriage, but especially tough for young marriages. I understand that feeling constantly lonely and being by yourself in an empty house is hard.

We talked, and she assured me that she loved me. She promised me that the affair meant nothing to her, that she just felt alone, and that she would cut off all contact with the guy. She understood that she would have to work to earn my trust back, agreed to give me access to her Facebook and to check her phone randomly until I can trust her again. She also agreed to go to marriage counseling. On my end, I’ve agreed to find a local job so that I can be with her and focus on our marriage. We aren’t having sex right now, and haven’t since she came clean to me. I wanted to take it slow getting intimate again, and she has respected that. We’ve been kissing, cuddling, and sleeping in the same bed. More recently, she has been insisting on giving me hand jobs, which I’m okay with. She says she just wants to know that I still want her, and that she wants to please me. I do want her, and I appreciate her efforts. Still, no sex though. It’s not her, it’s me. I still find her attractive, but I think it’s going to take at least a little while before I feel like having sex with her again. I guess I still feel grossed out by the prospect of it. Like she’s “unclean” or something. She understands how I feel, and is okay with it. She offered to let me cheat on her to “get even” or get some physical release, but I declined. I don’t want to screw somebody else. I want to be with my wife, and I just want things to go back to normal. 

Two weeks later, we find out she’s pregnant. Obviously, the other guy is the father. I’m the only person she has told so far. Being religious, abortion, off the bat, was off the table for us. I told her that I want her to put the baby up for adoption. I’m willing to forgive her and repair our marriage, and I can look past an awful lot. What I know that I cannot do is go through every day looking at a reminder of her infidelity and having this other guy intertwined in our lives in some capacity. I can’t do it. I know that probably makes me a poor Christian, but I’ve got to believe that God understands that I’m not perfect and forgives me.

She wants to keep the baby. She says that the other guy never has to know about it and that she understands that our marriage can not survive with him in our lives. But her opinion is that it isn’t the baby’s fault. The baby didn’t ask to be born out of an adulterous relationship. And that we would be unnecessarily causing the baby to suffer by putting it up for adoption. She also says that the baby is part of her, and that she would like me to be able to love and accept the child as a part of her instead of the other man. I understand where she is coming from, and I get that it would have to be terrible to carry a baby and have it growing inside of you for nine months knowing that you’ve got to give it away as soon as its born.

But I can’t do it. I really don’t know what else to say. She has agreed to go talk to our priest about it with me, but regardless of what he says, I can’t see either of us budging on it. My marriage might be over, and all I feel like doing is drinking until I pass out. I barely think about it, but we haven’t even talked to our families about the infidelity yet, let alone the pregnancy. The whole thing is embarrassing and I don’t want the attention. I don’t want people telling me that we’re “in their prayers” but judging our marriage and guessing how each of us failed. I just want it all to go away.

Thank you for reading this. If anyone else has gone through something like this and has had their marriage survive, I’d love to hear from you. I could use some optimism about now.

Tl;dr: My wife had an affair while I was away for work. I decided to forgive her, and felt like things were starting to look up. Then we found out she is pregnant. I want her to give it up for adoption. She wants to keep it. And now I just feel lost and unable to deal with this.

"My [22F] family are going to find out how much money my boyfriend [25M] makes. How do I handle this?


I'm from a small European country and my boyfriend is from the US. We met while studying in London three years ago and now live together in San Francisco. 

To get right to the point, my boyfriend earns a lot of money. He's not from a wealthy background so he doesn't show it off, and because property in SF costs so much we don't live in a mansion or anything. It's not immediately obvious how much he makes just from looking at him. 

One thing he does spend a lot of money on though is travelling. He will always fly first class and stay in disgustingly expensive hotels. I don't mind this (I mean... It is NICE) but it does make me a little bit uncomfortable. 

Where I am from we don't really have incomes as high as my boyfriend's, even the top business executives don't earn what he does, we are not a poor country we just don't have the kind of income disparity you see in the US. We are also very, I suppose humble is the right word. The idea of paying more to be treated better than other people is VERY unusual and will get people talking poorly about you.

We visit my family back home often. We will fly first class and then take a taxi to the nearest town. Then take a bus to my parents house and stay there. I always tell my family we flew economy and took busses all the way from the airport. My boyfriend goes along with this and has no problem staying on my parents couch. 

Now here's the issue. My family (parents, 2 brothers, 1 brother's girlfriend) are coming to stay with us in a few weeks. They are paying for their flighs and will be staying at our house. I didn't think this would be a problem since as I said, you can't really tell how much money we have just by looking at us / how we live. 

The problem is my boyfriend was taking with my brother and his girlfriend on Skype (they share an interest in a specific video game) and my boyfriend mentioned how he travels to NYC frequently for work. My brother and his girlfriend mentioned how they would love to go one day, and my boyfriend suggested making the holiday a week longer and going to NYC. They said they probably wouldn't have the money for that. My boyfriend then said he can put it down as a business expense, get a massive discount on flights and hotels, do some work while there, and everything will be fine. (Common practice in his company, not an issue in itself). 

He asked me, I didn't think and said yes. My brother asked my parents, they said yes, now we're all going to NYC... Fuck. 

Since its paid for though my boyfriend's work it's going to be first class flights for everyone, private drivers door to door, and $2000/night rooms. 

I just know my parents are going to offer to pay for my families flights and rooms. Anything else would be incredibly rude in our culture. Then I am going to have to explain to them that they can't pay because the NYC part of the trip alone will cost more than they earn in a year?!?! 

How on earth do I handle this? I talked to my boyfriend and  suggested canceling NYC or doing it cheaper. He thinks I'm overreacting and that it's one thing to pretend to get a bus but another to cancel / make worse my families trip to NYC? I don't think he understands how most people from my country understand wealth. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend is rich. My family don't know. They are going to fund out. In my culture people talk badly about others who earn that kind of money. 

Sorry for rambling / this being long / poorly written on my phone.

Edit : Just to clarify my boyfriend co-owns the business, he will be paying for everything it just goes though the company to get business rates from airlines and hotels. He's not taking any money from the business and his friend he owns the business with is fully aware. They both do this to varying degrees often."

"Our neighbors' [40s M and F] daughter [18] and her boyfriend [18?] entered into our house while my husband [38] and I [40F] were on vacation, did a bunch of drugs, and now our neighbors are saying that all of this is OUR fault


""Bob"" and ""Karen"" are our neighbors. They have an eighteen year old daughter, ""Terri.""


We were never especially close to them but we always do neighborly stuff for them, like take in their mail if they're on vacation, water their grass, feed their cat, etc. They do the same for us.


Two weeks ago my husband and I were going to go on a weekend trip to Las Vegas to see a show. We have an eleven year old daughter, and she spent the weekend at her aunt's house (my husband's sister). We have a small dog and we asked if Bob and Karen wouldn't mind feeding it while we were gone. They said they'd be glad to, and would we mind if their daughter be the one to do it. We've been acquainted with Terri ever since she was about ten or so, when the family moved into the neighborhood (we moved in around the same time). We had no problem with it at all, so we left a key with the parents.


Sunday when we were on our way back, I texted Karen to ask how everything was at home. She replied back ""fine"" but she needed to discuss something important with me.


When we got home we noticed a faint marijuana smell coming from the garage. We went into the garage and the smell was even worse. At that point Karen and her husband came over to tell us that they had caught their daughter smoking marijuana in our garage with her boyfriend. After questioning her, the daughter claimed that she had found the marijuana in our garage and the temptation was too strong. According to Terri's story, she had been in the garage looking for a leash to walk the dog, although all the dog's supplies were set out on the kitchen for convenience.


My husband and I both informed our neighbors that this story was ridiculous. However, Bob and Karen went on to say that ""they know their daughter"" and that she would never lie to them. Bob in particular got on his soapbox and started to lecture us how wrong it was for us to keep drugs in our house when we have a young child.


I had to squeeze my husband's hand to remind him not to lose his temper but we let them both know that the drugs were certainly not ours and that they had better keep a better eye on their own children, and that Terri is an adult and could face serious consequences if found with drugs.


Bob and Karen smirked at this suggestion and said it was pretty ironic for us to mention the law when we should supposedly be the ones being thrown in jail for ""furnishing drugs to minors"" or ""having drugs within reach of children"" (our daughter).


We once again reiterated that the drugs were not ours and that we would not stand for their accusations any longer.


They left in a huff.


Their daughter had since returned to her college campus and thus avoided me ever confronting her. We asked to speak to her that very day, but they said she was ""too distraught"" and that she had ""suffered enough."" 


I mean, WHAT?!


My husband is wondering how our neighbors ""caught"" their daughter smoking pot at our house in the first place. Was the garage door open? Were they making a lot of noise? Does the boyfriend have a distinctive car, the sight of which caused the father to investigate a little more?


Something doesn't add up.


Just to make it clear, neither my husband and I have any interest in pot or any other drugs. We only drink wine on occasion, at fancy dinners. 


But it doesn't end there. Bob and Karen have started to tell the other neighbors that we are drug users and that their daughter found drugs in our garage and ""you know how curious kids can be, so they smoked it...""


I ran into a neighbor at the grocery store and she told me that Karen had told me about what happened. I gave her my version of events and she tut-tutted me and said it was a shame I was living in denial.


This really makes me angry and upset. Also my husband and I have no intention of moving as we have too much money invested in this house. I am afraid Bob and Karen might even try to tell my husband's employers about this (he works in aerospace), and although I don't think they'll care if he smokes pot, I don't like what it will do for his reputation.


I myself work as a preschool teacher and some of my neighbors are whispering how shameful it is that I am around children when I am supposedly a huge druggy. I know I would be ruined if this reached MY superiors.


What can we do about this? I know my husband and I are innocent, and that Terri is lying to her parents and threw us under the bus, and her parents swallowed her story either because it's easier than facing the truth or they're really just that stupid.


Looking for ideas. I'm catching side-eye from everyone here these days.

"My [25F] teacher is threatening to do a bad social report on my education efforts because I don't want to help another student [28M]. I don't want to help him because he has made mean, inappropriate comments at me. Am I being an idiot or should I stand my ground.


I'm a girl from Scandinavia.
I'm studying to become, well, I don't know what is it called in English but it is something along the lines of an mechanical engineer. The school I go to is small, but pretty prestigious. I'm the only girl in a classroom of about 60 people.

Ever since day one, there's this other student I've had a problem with, or well, he has a problem with me. I'll refer to him as ""Ken"".
Ken has made some pretty inappropriate comments at me and has been quite mean to me.
He seems to think girls shouldn't be doing this kind of jobs. He has never outright said so, it is just the feeling I get from him.

At some point in the beginning of the first semester, our class was in the school workshop doing small projects. Ken and I had been put in a group together. I was drilling some holes into a sheet of wood, while doing this Ken pulled the drill out of my hands and told me he was going to do it instead.
I was pretty mad because, as anyone with half a brain would guess, what he did was dangerous, I could have gotten hurt. 
He kept telling me I was doing it wrong, I wasn't, like it somehow justified his action. Once I moved from my spot to do something else, he muttered ""go back to where you belong"". I don't think I was supposed to hear that.
In the following days Ken spread lies about how I was doing everything wrong in the project and the group constantly had to help me. 

I had episodes like that with him for the most of the first semester. I talked to our classcoach about it, but since none of the episodes was really ever specific enough to really pinpoint as bullying I was told to simply ignore him and avoid him. Which I did.
The following semesters, I didn't really have any problems with him.  We didn't interact much and was never put in any groups together.

Fast forward to this semester, I suddenly get an email from Ken asking me to help him with some of last semesters subjects. Everyone knows Ken did horrible last semester, a lot of people did.
I email him back a simple ""no"". I found out he had been emailing all of the people I was grouped up with last semester, and everyone told him to ask me for help because they felt I was the only one who actually know what I was doing (it is my strongest subject).

Then he starts bothering me at school, continually asking me to help him out. I keep telling him no. He asks me ""do we have a problem or something?"", like he has no idea why I don't want to help.
I ask him ""Are you serious?"" and then starts recounting a few of our previous episodes. He tells me he is sorry.
I tell him I don't know whatever he is honest or nor, but I don't really care. He knew at the time I didn't like how I was treating me and he never apologized. Actions has consequences and now he has to live with those consequences.

The following day my classcoach asks me to talk. He tells me Ken had told him about the situation and that I should accept his apology and help him out. 
I pretty much repeated what I said to ken, that I don't think it is about an apologize, it is about Ken's behavior being unacceptable and my behavior being a subsequent consequence.  
My classcoach said people should be allowed a second chance and once I finished school I would have to learn to work with people I didn't always like.
I said Ken had had plenty of ""second chances"" and that I don't think a student asking me to mentor him was anything like a work relation.
Then my classcoach said, unless I started acting like an adult, I would get a bad social report. A social report is pretty much a small report from your school which is used once you have to find an internship, a poor social report means your chances of getting an internship is poor too.

Now tell me, am I being a complete idiot? Am I being wrong when I don't feel like helping a guy whose behavior has been unacceptable because he suddenly turns around and tells me he is sorry?

Tl;DR - I either have to mentor a guy I hate a school, or loose my chances of getting a good internship."
"My [26M] ex-girlfriend [26F] who I dated for 4 years cheated on me. My friends and family are still close with her and told me to get over it. They're even friendly with the guy she cheated on me with.


Loooooong story short, I dated Kristen for 4 years. We met in college, were friends for a bit, and started dating. We moved in together and were definitely exclusive, I was even thinking about marriage. 

So, Kristen's family lives on the other side of the country. We both moved to the area where my family &amp; friends live. I have a HUGE family and a bunch of friends, and as soon as I introduced Kristen to them, they all loved her. She's ridiculously charming and sociable, and quickly became the social butterfly of this big group of people.

Things were going really well for us, we were living together and I thought we were very happy. A few months ago, I found out that Kristen was cheating on me with a guy she works with, Kenny [32]. My first response was obviously being devastated. I really loved her and wanted to marry her. The second response was jealousy and insecurity. I've seen Kenny around sometimes and the guy is tall, good looking, good job, in shape, funny, etc. It's a little funny in a sad way because he reminds me of the ""you vs. the guy she tells you not to worry about"" joke going around on Twitter.

I confronted her about it, she admitted it and basically said: ""Look, I'm sorry to have hurt you. I don't know if you can forgive this or not, but honestly I think that Kenny and I are really good for each other so it's best that me and you break this off."" I couldn't wrap my head around the fucking audacity to assume that I would want to forgive her and that she gets to ""win"" by breaking up with me first. It's been months and I'm still upset about the breakup.

Me and Kristen break up, she moves out (and moves in with Kenny), and news of the whole thing gets around to my circle of family and friends. At first they were very nice and people were telling me how unfortunate the whole situation was and how life is unpredictable yada yada yada. 

Literally 6 weeks after I find out Kristen cheated on me and she moved out, my oldest sister had a baby shower and invited Kristen. I wasn't at the shower but when I found out she was there, I was pissed. How can my sister betray me and be so loyal to a cheater? I made it very clear to my family how I felt about it but they seemed to blow off my reaction. Then maybe 3 weeks after that, one of my cousin's had a party and (again) invited Kristen. I was there and felt really uncomfortable. What pissed me off was how my cousins and the friends that I introduced to her were all in a circle talking to her, while I was so uncomfortable that I left early.

And the straw that broke the camel's back was yesterday when my best friend and his wife had a BBQ and (of course) Kristen was invited. And she brought Kenny with her. This is the first time Kenny met the group (again, people who I knew first) and they decide he's just a swell fucking guy. They're all laughing and talking. One of my friends came up to me and said ""shit, he's cool. Just gotta make sure I don't leave him alone with my wife."" It's a joke to them. I loved that girl for 4 years and treated her like a queen, but that means nothing. Afterwards I asked my best friend &amp; his wife if they invited Kenny or just Kristen and they said ""Kristen's really great and we wanted to meet her new boyfriend. What's in the past is in the past, let it go."" Keep in mind, everyone there knows that Kristen cheated on me with Kenny. Even my parents are telling me that Kristen's a great girl and ""like another daughter"" to them. My sister point-blank said to me that if she were to get married tomorrow, Kristen would be a bridesmaid and Kenny would be invited to the wedding.

I don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to give some ultimatum or anything, but I really think my family is treating me horribly. The only thing I can do is stop going to all social functions and that's a shit option. Am I right to be mad at my family and friends about this?

  **tl;dr: Introduced my girlfriend of 4 years to my friends and family. They all loved her. I found out she was cheating on me, everyone knows this, yet is still friends with her and even invite her new boyfriend (the one she cheated on me with) around to social functions.**"
"My [26F] boyfriend [30M] of 11 months is telling me I pee too much, need outside perspective


So this is kind of weird, but to give some background, I grew up with a brother who always maintained that my mom and I went to the bathroom too much. He'd always roll his eyes and scoff whenever she and I had to go before a movie and then after it too, every few hours on a road trip, etc. I always figured that since it was my mom and me going, that it was normal and my brother was being an ass. Or that maybe my mom and I both had small bladders since we're kind of thin women - I'm 5'8"" and 130lbs (which is the heaviest I've ever been and for most my life I've been clinically underweight) - and my brother was still being an ass about it.

But now my boyfriend is telling me the same thing and I don't know how to handle it? Usually it comes up in discussion when we go out to eat, because I normally drink plenty of fluids with my meals and can go through two or three glasses by the time dinner's over - so I usually go to the bathroom right after eating, about an hour after that, and then again an hour after that. I know that's three times, but when we go out I'm drinking a lot of fluid and also eating a lot, so my stomach is kind of pressing on my bladder? I also do my best to keep hydrated on top of that.

My boyfriend keeps bringing it up through. He acts surprised when I say I have to go and gets kind of standoffish about it, especially since when we go out to eat and then try to be intimate afterwards, I have to stop to pee. He's suggested that I not drink so much at dinner, and even given me looks before when I accept refills from the waiter. He's asked me if I have a yeast infection since that's supposed to cause frequent urination. I also mentioned I had a history of diabetes in my family and then he wanted to be sure I don't have that. I know I don't have diabetes or even pre-diabetes (I have another condition that's monitored through blood work every six months) and I'm pretty sure I don't have a yeast infection either. But he keeps bringing it up, sometimes in a way that makes it seem like he's annoyed and sometimes in a way that seems kind but still implies there's something wrong with me. He's brings up stories about people dying from drinking too much water and asks me what I think about them, but never seems satisfied with my answer (that it's sad and wondering how much water they drank). When I go back to visit my family (about a six hour drive) he'll ask me how many times I stopped. Sometimes the answer is three - about every hour, hour and a half, depending on when I left - and then he'll go on a tangent about how that's wasting time and I should've just kept going, etc. I tell him that it's not his business how long it takes me, and that I like to get out and stretch my legs too.

This has been going on since the start of our relationship, but it happened so infrequently that I didn't really pay it much mind. However it really came to a head for me this past weekend when we were driving back from the beach. It was a three hour drive (he was driving in his car) and I had to pee about an hour in. When I told him, he asked, ""What would happen if I just kept driving? And didn't stop?"" I told him that if that happened, I'd pee in his car. He looked at me and went ""Really?"" as though he expected me to be joking. I looked at him and said, ""Really! I have to pee! I can't hold it two more hours!"" And then he found a gas station and we stopped.

I can't help but think about what would've happened if we hadn't stopped though. Like, before he was just kind of questioning, and even the medical stuff could've been him just...being concerned? But this is the first time he's done or said anything that made me worried that he might have prevented me from getting to the bathroom. I'm also feeling really guilty now over the amount that I pee?

So... what's reddit's take I guess? Am I overreacting to the beach incident? Should I just...try to drink less water? I'm going through an average of about 64oz or water or lemonade a day (I have a hydration tracker app). Is there something I can do to get him off my back or at least understand that I genuinely do have to pee? Since both my boyfriend and my brother have brought this up, does that make them both assholes or is something wrong with me?

Tl;Dr I am well hydrated. Boyfriend thinks I pee too much and keep bringing it up."

"Me [23M] with my GF [23F]. She's pregnant and people are telling me to prepare for the worst.


EDIT: I just logged in and holy...I don't even know what to say. I didn't expect to get some many responses. I'll try and reply, but I just want everyone to know how much I appreciate all of this. I scanned through some of the replies and you guys are awesome. I'm really touched that so many of you shared your stories with me, and gave me all that advice. I'm also a little ashamed for letting those stupid comments get to me in such a way. I'm taking the day off to be with Nita today, and I'll show her all of these comments. Thank you so much.



I'm living a nightmare when this was supposed to be the best time of my life. Our lives. 

I don't know how relevant this shit is, but I had a terrible childhood. My parents tried to sell me when I was 4 for drugs. Yes. I was then taken away from them and bounced through the foster system until I was 15, when I was adopted by a man who already had a biological son and another adopted child (he's the eldest in our family). They're a nice family and they offered me shelter and love.  But I guess I was a little too damaged and I acted out. Had a huge fall out with them and moved out when I was 18. We've reconciled and are on very good terms now, but my point is that I never had a constant parental figure in my life, I have always been on my own. 

Then I met Nita, and fell in love and we started dating. It started with casual hookups and then transformed into a relationship and, basically, she saved me. I love her more than anything. We got pregnant, and it wasn't planned and we were terrified but happy. I knew our lives were going to change, but I didn't see the bad stuff coming.

The first trimester was hell, and Nita lost 15 pounds because she couldn't keep anything down. She was in constant pain and nausea and miserable. We thought, okay, first trimesters can be really awful. This is our first pregnancy and none of use knew how to handle it properly. Near the end of the first trimester, we discovered that she has pre-eclampsia. It was explained to us how dangerous that is, and we were given a list of things to do so we could have a relatively normal pregnancy and keep it at low risk. Nita has been on bed rest since then, going crazy and growing depressed. The only time I see her smiling is when our baby kicks. She's tired and drained all the time, and she's eight months pregnant now. She's getting worse and our doctor is saying we may have to induce labor early.

And everyone is telling me to prepare for the worst, that I can lose them both, that I will probably lose one of them and I'm so fucking terrified that I can't think straight. I'm pissed off. I don't know what the fuck I did to lose everything I love all the fucking time. And I can see how worried and sad Nita is and I don't know how to handle this. How do I handle this? I want to convince her that everything will be okay but I can't convince myself. I don't know what to do, I've been by her side all the time, we both really want a family, this baby, even it's early to have kids. I'm so angry because everyone kept telling us we were making a mistake by having a baby now, and we both told them all to fuck off because who the hell says that? 

We're having a girl that is very much wanted, but I don't know how to make it alright, how to comfort my girlfriend, how to not crumble in front of her and scare her even more. I believe we can pull through this, that it's not as bad as they make it look, but it's like we have an entire world against us and I'm lost. I'm scared I'll lose my girls, I'm scared I won't know how to be a father, I never had one. I'm terrified here.

"Me [26F] with my friend[24F]; she's not conventionally attractive but keeps applying for jobs that require a certain level of physical beauty


My friend Ashley [24F] is great. She's sweet and driven and creative and caring. I'm honestly convinced that she could build a good career for herself in most industries. It's just that she keeps applying for jobs that are explicitly hiring really, really pretty people and then being completely devastated by the inevitable rejection. 

Ashley isn't ugly; I want to make that clear. She's tall (about 5'10) and slim (130-ish pounds). That said, she has pretty bad facial acne that's resistant to every treatment she's willing to try. She has dark, thick eyebrows which she doesn't groom or style. Her hair reaches past her waist, and while it's very pretty, it's not really the look most of her preferred careers are looking for. She's not curvy and she dresses quite conservatively, which leads to her looking shapeless. Some of these things are fixable, some are not, but the point is, when you imagine a 'hot girl', you're not thinking of her. 

Here's a list, in no particular order, of the jobs Ashley has applied to over the past four years: brand representative model (i.e. the pretty girls who work at car shows), club promoter model, Disney princess, high fashion model, catalog model, actress in commercials, you get the picture. To the best of my knowledge, she's never gotten past the first or second round of auditions and interviews. 

There are two big problems when it comes to Ashley. First, the rejections really mess her up. She stays in, she stops talking with me and the rest of her friends for a couple of weeks, she refuses to date, and she tries weird crash diets. Her behavior would look like the symptoms of a mental illness if she didn't get over it in a few months, just to apply again, get rejected, and repeat the cycle. Second, Ashley is putting her life on hold to follow this dream. She works retail and she's overqualified for it. But she's convinced that there's no point in looking for any other kind of job, since she'll just have to quit when she makes it big. She's always short on money and working miserable hours. 

So, reddit, any advice? Are there any jobs that are close in spirit to what she wants and are actually attainable? Is there a way to gently hint to her that she might want to consider a different career path? Or, if that doesn't work, how do we get her to react to rejection more constructively?

**tl;dr**: My friend wants to work as a model or similar but doesn't have the looks for it. Not being hired makes her feel terrible. How can we talk to her about this? "

"My boyfriend [24M] despises when I [22F] go surfing, but it's a big part of my life. What do I do?


I won't give out too many details, but I'm an avid surfer and I've been in a few championships throughout my life, yet nothing too major; mostly small tournaments held in my country. I began surfing when I was just twelve years old when my father bought me my first board and we've been surfing together ever since, though in the last few years he's decided to stop due to a back injury. I surf mostly with my cousins now, and sometimes with a group of friends I met through surfing. Basically, I don't know what my life would be like if I didn't surf. I'm in no way 'addicted' to it, and I can undoubtedly go weeks without it, but I do start to miss it after some time. I enjoy being able to go at LEAST once every month, but I won't complain nor become unbearable to be around if I don't. 

I've met some great people down at the beaches and it's a great culture if it's what you're interested in, and I've recently become a kitesurfing instructor down at the beach, so four days a week I work from 2pm-7pm while I'm in between jobs.

Let's get to the issues now! I've been with Mark for seven months so it's a fairly new relationship and up until last week I've been really happy and there haven't been many problems. Last week, he admitted to me he has a huge problem with me going surfing and he asked me stop. He's told me the major issue is his mother drowned when he was just a little boy, and he says he's freaking out thinking he'll lose me to the ocean as well. I told him I understand his concerns but these are risks I'm willing to take, and so he should trust in me and allow me to carry on doing what I love doing. I'm not stupid, I don't go anywhere near the sea when it's not in a good state. I know about under currents, I know when not to swim, but he doesn't trust that I do. 

I understand his worries but I feel like he isn't trusting me. Another major issue is he doesn't like my group of friends who come with me and he says they make him feel small and emasculated, just because they can surf and he cannot. I've told him that's ridiculous and I've never even thought of them as attractive or appealing to me as more than just a friend, but he still tells me he feels jealous and insecure when they're around. He never comes to the beach with us anymore, so I don't think he's even seen them in a while. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want him to feel jealous or worried about me, but I also can't stop doing what I love to do. It's a fun sport, and I know I'm good at it. It feels strange to give it up because my boyfriend doesn't like it. I've thought about it and I'm not sure if he just feels insecure because he's a slightly overweight and doesn't enjoy working out, but that would be so silly. I don't know how to approach this. He's been telling me he doesn't like it for several reasons so now I'm not sure which one to believe?

I want to ask him about this. Yesterday was the first time I've gone surfing in two weeks, and he refused to speak to me when I called him once I got home. He didn't return my calls nor messages, and this morning he explained it was because he was disappointed in me for going surfing again.

I'm getting sick of this attitude and I don't know what to do. Thanks in advance, and I'm sorry for quite a long post.

tl;dr Boyfriend has decided he doesn't like when I go surfing for several reasons. One reason is he's worried something will happen to me like I'll drown, another is he doesn't like the people I go down to the beach with. He wants me to stop but I don't want to, and I want to know what the real reason is. HELP ME!"

I told him that I am tired of having this argument and seeing no changes, so this time, there are date stamps on it.  If one month from today I am seeing no changes and we are still where we started, he goes to the guest room.  If one month from that we are back here again, he goes to his mom's house.  If one month from that we are still in the same place, we go to divorce court.  He says that he understands and is going to work towards change.  I will keep you guys posted for those that care.

Let me give a little background.  My husband and I met when we were in college.  We were friends for 7 months before we started dating, we dated for 23 months before we got engaged, and we were engaged for 21 months before we got married.  So we didn't exactly rush into things here.

Lately (well, for a while now) I feel like I am having to raise my husband, and I am getting sick of it.  I have a Master's degree and work at a full-time, career-path job that I have had for almost 6 years.  I am training for a marathon and keep an active social life.  My husband does have his Bachelor's, but he is working a part-time job as a delivery driver and is registered as an Uber driver on the side (although I can't remember the last time he turned on the app and picked up a fare).  He plays video games literally 4+ hours every single day and if he could survive without ever leaving the couch, I think he would stay on it forever.

I am a very ambitious and goal-driven person, and he is not.  If it weren't for me, I 100% believe that my husband would be a single college drop-out living with his parents and delivering pizzas for spending money.  And he would be just as content with his life that way as he is with it now.  He seems perfectly happy to just sit around, get fatter, work just enough to scrape by financially, and play video games all day.

If I don't tell him to do something, it doesn't get done.  When I go out of town on a business trip, I come home to dirty dishes, dirty laundry, and an overflowing garbage can.  Because without me there to either do it for him or tell him to do it himself, he somehow doesn't realize that dishes and clothes don't wash themselves and that garbage doesn't take itself out.  If I don't remind him a hundred times that a certain event or obligation is coming up, he will absolutely forget it (and sometimes he still does anyway).  If I don't roll him out of bed when his alarm clock goes off every morning, he will turn it off and be late for work (like he was today).  If I don't remind him to brush his teeth, he'll go days without doing it.  If I don't stand over him and watch him fill out a job application, he won't apply for better jobs at all.

And it's not about the money that he makes at his job.  I make enough money by myself to support the both of us, and I'm not trying to save up for a vacation home in the Hamptons or anything.  It's about the fact that a college-educated grown man is working part-time as a delivery driver, *and he doesn't seem to care.*  When I talk to him about his job, he says he doesn't like it, so I tell him to apply for other jobs.  But he never does.

I have even tried to help him with his job search.  I have polished his resume for him.  I have searched for and found jobs that I think he would like and sent him the application links.  I have asked around in my network and found some connections who have said that if my husband will apply at their company, they'll put his name forward with HR.  I have done everything short of dress up as him and pretend to be him in an interview.  He resists my efforts to help at every turn.

It has come to a breaking point, and last week we went and sat down with a counselor.  In the session, my husband said that he's actually not OK with his current situation and would like a better one, but that he gets overwhelmed and discouraged by the job application process.  The counselor worked with him individually on that, and she encouraged me to step back and not get involved in his job search.  She said that if I tell him that I trust him to do it himself and leave it up to him, it will help his confidence and he will do better at job searching on his own.  Guess how many jobs he's applied for in the last 8 days since the session?

Last night as we were getting ready for bed, I was standing in the bedroom and I heard him yelling from the living room.  He was freaking out and throwing things.  I asked him what was wrong, and he started going off about how the charger cable for his PS4 controllers was broken again and he was tired of not being able to play because the batteries in this controllers were always dead.  (Side note:  this is the second replacement charger cable I have gotten for him that has supposedly broken.  He's the common denominator here, so I don't know what he's doing to break the cables, but I'm not buying him another one.)  I very calmly told him that he needed to calm down, that it wasn't that big of a deal.  He told me that I was being condescending and I needed to shut up.

He then went to bed.  I put on my shoes and went for a drive for a while to clear my head, crying the whole damn time.  My husband, who is supposed to be my partner in life, just threw a temper tantrum because his toy isn't working.  Instead of feeling like he is my equal, I feel like I am raising a 7-year-old with bad manners.

Today he texted me that he is sorry that we fought, but he blamed me for crying (""you didn't need to do that"") and focused the whole time on how I made *him* feel by ""being condescending.""  I texted him back that he needs to get a better job and learn to control his temper because I am done trying to make him grow up.  He hasn't responded.  That was 4.5 hours ago.  I am going out for a beer after work with my 28F best friend.  I don't know what to do or say when I get home.  How do I handle this?  Is there a chance my husband might grow up in counseling?  Or should I just tell him to pack his bags and hire a lawyer?

I started dating this girl about 5 months ago after knowing her for 2 years. I met her in college and we kept in contact after I graduated and dated shortly after. I am in grad school now and we live a few hours away. She is an awesome person and super enjoyable to be around. We have similar hobbies and I love her to death. When she visits for weekends we have an awesome time watching movies or going for walks around the nearby lake.

The only issue is that I am the only person she can talk to while at home. She lives in the middle of nowhere with only her brother. Her mother passed away about a month after we started dating (so about 4 months ago) and she never had a father. Since then, she has been in constant communication day and night.

At first I was completely OK with the situation. While heartbroken about the loss of her mother, I was happy that she was turning to me in her time of need. I love being there for her. I know she needs a shoulder to lean on during these hard times. I don't know what losing a parent is like I can't imagine how hard it must be for her at such a young age. For these reasons, it makes complete sense that she would want to talk so much and I am all for healthy communication to make a long-ish distance relationship work and I am all for supporting her when she needs me most.

Before we were dating, I would tell her that I was going to have a guys night and that I'd either text her later that night or the next morning. She would be totally fine with it. Post-dating, she gets extremely emotionally upset to the point of crying if I do not call her from ~5:00pm-12:00am *every single night.* If I try to hang up early she will become EXTREMELY depressed and talk about how lonely she is and how terrible her night will go if I hang up so I always end up just staying on the phone. If I don't call by 5:30pm, she is calling non-stop until I answer.

I tried having a guys night but she made me feel so incredibly guilty the entire night by constantly texting me about how lonely she was and how she has no one to talk with ect. I ended up cutting the night short to call her. I love her and I understand that she doesn't have a lot to do or have anyone to talk to besides her brother, but I still want at least a little bit of ""me-time"" before bed. I have an internship that lasts from 9:00am-5:00pm which is when she calls. I have not had virtually any time at all to myself for the last 3 months.

Alternatively, I would also like to have a day or so where I do nothing but be a dweeb and play video games for an unhealthy amount of time with the guys (being away from home in grad school, this is my only way to catch up with them. We spend most of the time talking instead of playing anyway). I used to do this semi-frequently as a means of staying in touch, but that has virtually vanished. I don't want to lose my other friendships by only talking to her every day.

So...am I wrong to want some time to myself each night or to want a day to to catch up with friends? I would like to have a healthy relationship with my girlfriend AND my friends if possible, but I feel like I am hurting her by talking to ANYONE else. Thoughts?

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend calls 6-7 hours a night after the loss of her mom. I want some time to myself but I feel guilty and I am worried about my other friendships. Am I wrong to want space?"
"[UPDATE] My [27M] younger brother [25M] no longer wants reconcile with our parents [60s M/F]


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wybm1/my_27m_younger_brother_25m_no_longer_wants/)

So, I didn't have the meeting my parents wanted. They hung up on me when I told them it wasn't going to happen, and said that I was just envious of my brother and always had been. I guess I'm cut off for the time being. However, I see they are liking a lot of grandparents rights articles on Facebook lately. So I doubt they will be learning from this sadly.

I decided to tell Aaron about the forced meeting they planned. He is quite happy that I respected his wishes above there demands. He remains clean and will turn 26 next week. Linnie is fine and remains clean as well. Trent remains healthy and is growing at an astonishing rate.

That's about it. Let's hope it stays that way!

tl:dr: Did not have meeting. All is well except my parents remain angry."
"Am I [27M] wrong to feel bad about the fact that my girlfriend [31] insists on displaying a large photo of herself and her ex in MY home?

"My [22M] GF [21F] got involved w/ Amway (Pyramid scheme) and I refuse to go to a meeting with her.


Hey everyone,

So we've been dating for ~2.5 years now. About a year ago she got recruited into Amway by one of her extended family members, and she's taken a large liking to their system. For those who haven't had the pleasure of dealing w/ Amway and the likes; It's basically a restructured pyramid scheme, ""make money quick"" type deal. But it is rather massive, probably one of the larger companies out there for this type of crap.

Anyway, there's some sort of meeting in a week or two and my GF wanted to invite me to it. This isn't the first time she's talked about Amway w/ me. She's invited me before to a meeting or two but I've always refused. She's joked about me buying stuff from her like energy drinks and protein powder but she never pushed that. She's joked and made fun of me saying that I have money and I can spend it on myself while still helping her, but they were only side remarks which I didn't take seriously. She really only pushed me on coming to this meeting.

In the begining I reluctantly agreed saying that sure I'll go it's only 2 or 3 hours. But more recently I told her that I really didn't want to go and I don't think I will go w/ her. She took that as an offense saying I never supported her with Amway and she already told her ""upline"" that I was gonna go. I told her straight up that yes, i never supported you and I don't think I ever will. 

I told her before that Amway was a MLM scheme and they'll try to take money from her one way or another. I told her that her meetings will likely involve ""leadership seminars"" which are, you guessed it, pay to enter. She's told me that she isn't there to make money but she's learning a lot about leadership and how to manage her ""independent business"". She clearly hasn't read anything from a non-member/ex-member view. I even showed her legitimate articles and books from previous members showcasing their negative experience with the whole thing. 

Regardless of what I've told her, I even went as far as saying that fine, you can be part of it but please don't involve me with it. I don't want to push my own opinion of the company on you and I don't want you to push Amway on me. She took that even worse than the previous things I've said. 

Now I'm at the point of her not talking to me and blocking me on hangouts and she's not picking up my calls.

What the hell. Am I wrong in my views? Should I support her in this? There is no way that this company can be good for her in the long term. She has bought a case or two of their products to try and sell and they've given her a pack of business cards saying ""&lt;name&gt;, Independent Business Owner"" and her phone number. She's just starting out so I guess they haven't asked her for much money. 


Anyway, Has anyone dealt with family/friends involved w/ Amway? What did you end up doing?


**TL;DR** - My GF has become involved w/ Amway and it's affecting our relationship because I openly don't support her."

"My (27F) Fiancé (27M) suggested that we have a ""free week"" before our wedding - help?


I will be sure to be as brief as possible in this post.

For the sake of this story, I will call my fiancé ""Mark"". Mark and I started dating and seeing each other over 3 years ago. We were both graduating university with our degrees in our respected fields. I have been very fortunate to be with such an amazing guy like Mark. Both of us have similar personalities, we are smart with our money (keep our accounts separate), and we have always tried to help one another out during tough times that we have had to face. We have slowly been planning the wedding, but we still have no ""official date"". All in all, no complaints from my end!

Last fall, Mark proposed to me. It was one of the happiest moments I have had in my life! It wasn't one of the ""show boating"" proposals that we have seen acquaintances do all for social media sake. It was our own little thing. Since the proposal back in the fall, I have felt our relationship has never been stronger! Recently, Mark and I did a little *West Coast Swing* of California. We started up around *Crescent City* all the way down most of Northern California, but not as far as San Francisco/the Bay Area. 

We had a wonderful week in a half road trip! We were stopping at little towns, going to beaches, and really just having a relaxing actions, where we did whatever we were in the mood to do or see. A few days into the trip, Mark and I stayed at this lovely beach house hotel, a little north of Fort Bragg. One of the nights we were staying there, we ran into this couple who had a room beside us. They were a married couple in their early 30s. Lovely people! One of the nights they invited us over to the room to sit on their deck and have a few drinks. (**Extra info**: They have been married for around 3 or 4 years I believe)

It was a lovely time! We got to know each other pretty well, as well has have a fun time meeting new people. I ended up leaving their room around midnight since I was tired. The wife of the couple did the same thing as me an hour or so before I left back to our room. My fiancé Mark and this other gentlemen were up fairly late. It didn't bother me since they weren't talking super loud anyway.

**(The trip information is important for this next part!)** 

Now, around a week later, once we had already gotten home a few days later. Mark asked me if we could have a talk about something. I was really curios to see what he wanted to talk about. I actually assumed that he had some more ideas or suggests for our wedding. So, hearing what I was about to hear completely took my head for a whirl. Mark asked me if the both of us could have a ""free week"". I asked him to explain a little bit more. He basically broke it down saying that we could each have 3 or so days to be free to do whatever we want. He said that we could get anything out of the system that we wanted; hardcore partying, doing any drugs that we wanted, sex with different people, etc, etc, etc. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! 

After he explained to me his suggestion, I had to ask where this came from. He went on to tell me that the couple we met in Fort Bragg during our little vacation did that before their marriage. He continued to tell me that the man he was speaking to said it helped their marriage a lot. The guy and his wife were able to do anything they wanted for a set period of time. Apparently they had a written contract for which they signed and agreed on to the specific time/dates. Mark went on to tell me a little bit more about what they talked about. I couldn't believe it! In addition, Mark mentioned that the guy said if they didn't do it before they got married, he was sure that they wouldn't last.  Apparently they exchanged numbers and having been talking a little bit here and there.. I mean, I didn't really get that close to his wife. I had a feeling this is what the two of them talked about later on in the early hours of the morning. 

Anyway, this is why I am coming to /r/relationships! Do any of you have any ideas **how** I can approach this situation with my fiancé to ***nix*** this idea. How can I approach this issue without having a terrible situation on my hands. I already told him when he was telling me this that I wasn't impressed at all, and that I have never heard of such a thing. How can I get my fiancé off of this idea, and back on track?

  **tl;dr**: My (27F) fiancé ""Mark"" (27M) suggested that we have a ""free week"" before our wedding. When we were traveling down a part of the West Coast of California (mainly the Northern area), we met this married couple at our hotel in Fort Bragg. We had drinks one night we were together, and my fiancé and this man started talking about things. This is when a few days after out trip, my fiancé approached me about this idea. How do I approach this situation with my fiancé?"
