"[Update] My brother [27m] does some really creepy stuff and I'm [21f] done with him.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fz0bc/my_brother_27m_does_some_really_creepy_stuff_and/

I talked to my parents and told them I was tired of my brother's behavior and that they should do something, otherwise I wouldn't be going home anymore. They said I was being too ""extreme"" and that he would stop eventually, but that shit has been going on since we were kids and I knew he wasn't going to stop, so I gave them an ultimatum. They would talk to my brother and my brother would stop or the 3 of them could have a nice life.


My parents talked to him, after all. My brother refused to get evaluated at first... he was really upset. He went over to my dorm and tried to choke me. He screamed at me, then he tried to choke me, then he realized what he was doing and started crying and apologizing. Someone called the cops because my brother tried to kill himself afterwards.


Anyway, everything is ok now. I mean, not everything. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He didn't get a full-written report because it's been a week and it takes time, but that was the feedback and diagnosis. I'm going to be ok.
I just wanna say thank you for the advice and stuff, you know. I appreciate it (a lot). &lt;3


tl;dr: my brother ended up getting arrested for trying to choke me then kill himself then he got evaluated and now he's going to be ok, hopefully.

"[Update] I [36F] finally admitted to myself that I'm bisexual. Should I tell my husband[38M] together 16 years?

"[UPDATE] I [23 M] found my girlfriend's [23F] fake instagram account where she follows my exes, past flings, hookups, etc.


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/)


So I decided to try to talk to my girlfriend casually about the account. 


I told her that when she was letting me use her phone (I logged her out of Instagram and was going to log into mine so that I could post a photo directly from her phone, and saw the other account as an option) I noticed the other account.


She looked horrified at first, but then without any prompting at all she confessed that she had a super insecure day after exactly the incident I was discussing with other commenters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/dapmmqk/?st=iw8j5cz5&amp;sh=51581fcc)  (so thank you very much for making me introspect, reddit). She ranted to her best friend about how she was feeling, and the two of them made the account. They crept the accounts that accepted the follow requests, her friend helped her boost her ego a bit with some girl talk, and she completely forgot about it. 


She said she was having a really hard time when I was depressed, but felt like she couldn’t complain about it because my pain was “worse,” so she just sort of let a whole bunch get to her over time. 


She told me that she felt her poor handling of certain things this summer (her words), and the massive insecurity she felt, was an indicator that she probably needed to talk to someone and work through some things, and she’s actually been seeing a therapist every other week or so for the past few months. This wasn't just due to the summer, as she felt she's needed to do this for a while, it was just sort of what motivated her.

This shocked me, and she apologized for not telling me. She says that she felt like she couldn’t complain to me about her mental health when she knew I was going through so much. And then when I started to get better she didn’t know how to randomly bring it up since some time had past. 

I had no idea how hard my depression was on her. I feel so selfish that I didn’t even notice, but she says she completely understands, and she know how preoccupying depression can be. 

All in all, she apologized profusely for the account, deleted it in front of me, and we promised to try to get back to being the good communicators we were before my depression hit. 

TL;DR - Talked to her. She was embarrassed, had forgotten about the account, and revealed why she made the account without any prompting. She took trying to support me during my depression harder than I realized, and we're going to try to be better communicators. "
"""UPDATE"" My [24f] boyfriend [25m] of 8 months is starting to police my eating habits and I'm tired of it.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53jjzt/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_of_8_months_is_starting_to/ 
  

So in case anyone is wondering turns out my (now) ex's mother and two sisters had him convinced I had some kind of eating disorder and would nag at him about it and make him feel like crap for ""letting"" me hurt myself. All three of them are obese so idk why he weighed their opinion on nutrition so heavily. I pointed that out (with more tact) and we had a much better conversation about why he needed to lay off on how I eat. He did make a lot of effort to keep his opinions to himself but could never completely let his worry go. 


Officially this isn't why we broke up but it was kind of like the shattering illusion from HIMYM that kind of made me start noticing how he's quick to be arrogant, condescending, and patronizing when he thinks he's right and how he buys into every dumb thing his family tells him without question. Stuff like that. 
 


  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend's overweight family was telling him I must have an eating disorder. We talked it out but broke up later anyway. "

"My [19F] girlfriend [20F] of almost 2 years lost her eye. She doesn't want to be around me anymore because she thinks I'll think she's ugly, even though I don't.


So last month, my girlfriend got in a fight with another girl. The other girl was wearing a ring and got my girlfriend right in the eye and scratched it. It ended up getting infected so it had to be removed. Ever since then she's been avoiding me, even though I saw her right after the fight and saw what she looked like when it was basically at it's worse and I still thought she was beautiful then so why would I think she's ugly now? She won't answer my texts, except for one to tell me that she's sorry I have to be with someone as disgusting as her and if I broke up with her she'd understand. I don't want to break up with her, I love her to death. 2 eyes, 1 eye, or none, I couldn't care less. I want to be there for her and she just wont let me. I know she needs her time but I'm worried about her. So should I keep trying to talk to her or let her come to me? I've called her mom and her mom says she's basically always crying which makes me feel horrible because I'm not there to be there for her. What can I do for her? 



Edit: just in case anyone was wondering: 

&gt;So this older girl used to be in like a big sister program and my gf was her ""little sister"". The older girl ended up having a alchohol problem and was constantly bugging us for money. Last month was when GF stopped giving money to older girl, so OG got pissed and went on this tirade about dykes and how we're going to hell and blah blah blah, then spits in GFs face. GF punches her and that's when OG hit her in the face.

"UPDATE: Discovered my [38 M] wife [38 F] of 17 years has been texting another man for 1.5 years and hiding it from me


For those who read it, here is a link to the original post from 2 days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5gu19m/discovered_my_38_m_wife_38_f_of_17_years_has_been/

First, I'll start by apologizing again for the wall of text.  There's a lot here and it may not be interesting to some, but it's cathartic to me.  Second, before I start, I want to sincerely thank all those who commented on my post, but especially those who mentioned the iphone recovery software.  I owe you a huge debt - you're why Reddit is great.

Ok, we left off Monday night with her admitting to an emotional affair with another man for 1.5 years, but saying that was it.

After I posted on Reddit and people mentioned the iphone recovery software, I phoned to tell her not to use her phone and that I was going to recover the information later that night. She immediately admitted to sexting the other guy.

I got home and tried to run the software.  For whatever reason (probably human error), it didn't work well.  It only pulled up portions of 350 texts and none of them seemed relevant.  I decided not to pay $70 for the whole install and dropped the idea.

I went out with a friend (who had been the victim of adultery) for drinks at 7 to discuss and he thought I should give my wife a second chance, as long as she had never met the other guy.

I got home around 9:30.  She was sitting with her best friend in the sun room talking.  I said an awkward hi to the best friend (who I am sure knew) and went up to my office.  My wife came up 10 minutes later (when her friend had left) and immediately started yelling at me - telling me that I basically needed to get over it and that she wasn't going to feel like she had today for 6 months.  I kind of flipped out, noting that I had known for 30 hours (and was only receiving trickle truths during that period).  After we finished yelling at each other she left (she went into my daughter's bedroom to comfort her - I assumed she left to text the other guy) and I finished up my work and went to bed in the guest room.

I woke up about 1:30.  I went into the master bedroom and grabbed her phone.  I scrolled through the texts and emails, but there was almost nothing there as anything older than a day or so had been deleted.  I felt horrible.  I felt like I needed to be able to trust her, but continued to firmly believe she was lying to me and that there were things she wasn't telling me.

I put the phone back in her room and then went back into the office.  I googled iphone recovery software and saw a couple results that looked interesting.  I went back into the room and grabbed her phone again.  This time she woke up and followed me into the office.  I paid more attention to the software this time.  I turned the phone into airplane mode, I disabled iTunes autosync, I closed all the programs, etc.  I ran the free test and it came back with 3,500 results, the sixth of which was from the other guy.  I paid the $50 for the software and ran the full program.  It took about 10 minutes, during which she continually tried to convince me not to look at it.

Once I had the results, I started going through the texts.  The good news was that there was nothing that suggested she and the other guy met.  I had been in Europe from Monday through Thursday of last week and there were lots of recent texts.  A lot of them were sexual, but none suggested they were meeting.

Which gets to the bad news.  I asked when they started sexting - she said October.  I looked through the texts (they're not really organized by name just file size, so you kind of have to look through all of them) and found one from July.  It was clearly from someone else anyway (the style was very different) and was very sexually forward (I can't wait to see you naked, I'll wear anything you want, etc.).  There was also discussion of meeting up.

So she trickle truthed meeting up with 2 other guys from Craigslist.  She said she ""fooled around with"" one of them, but that they met at a park, so they didn't have sex.

At that point, I honestly felt like a huge weight had been taken off my shoulders.  All of the doubt that I could trust her again became irrelevant and I knew I could move on with a clean conscience.

Later that night, she trickle truthed sleeping with the other Craigslist guy (one time).  Last night she admitted to sleeping with another guy in Alaska when she went there alone on vacation a year and a half ago.  I do believe her that she didn't meet the guy she was texting continuously given the texts I read (although given the way the texts were progressing, I firmly believe it would have happened eventually) and that nothing seemed to happen when I was out of town for a week, but it doesn't really matter now.

You can guess the postscript.  She's been crying her eyes out and begging me to give her another chance.  I plan on sticking together through the holidays for the sake of the kids, but will be moving out come January.

tl;dr**: Wife has been cheating on me.  Thanks to reddit, I busted her."
"My [30f] wife is trying to keep me [29m] away from her gym break up party


This weekend coming up is my wife's gym break up party, in which they all get drunk and celebrate being fit and shit. They held one of these events just over 2 months ago, and I attended with my wife and her friends, the night was a standard drunk night out, we all had fun. Her friend did keep making fun of my wife for having a crush on her 'The Rock' lookalike personal trainer though.



These jokes didn't bother me on the night, and I even joined in myself. It wasn't until the next few weeks, my wife claimed to be going to some free PT sessions to help train one of the new ones. I believed her at the start, until week 2 or 3 I noticed withdrawals from our account of the exact amount a PT session with The Rock would cost, taken out about 10 minutes before she was due to start.  I also noticed her texting him later on those days, either saying thanks or booking the next weeks.



I have no idea why she needed to lie about these, but it happened anyway.  It wasn't until I was doing our tax, I questioned her on the withdrawals, but she still claimed they were free.  At this point I also suggested he was a rip off, as $80 for one hour of training is a lot of money.  This resulted in her not really talking to me for 3-4 days (lol).



When she began talking to me again, I was told she was changing to 'group training' which was half the price of a 1 on 1.  I seemed happy with this, until I noticed the same amount of money being taken from the account, or a build up of withdrawals during the week to cover a 1 on 1 session. I've let this ride until this week, which is now her break up party.



I asked last week what the go was, what time and where we are going etc.  She said she was bringing a girlfriend who went last time, and that she wanted to catch up with her at the break up party, and pretty much uninviting me from the event. 



This is where I unfortunately checked her iPad with her messenger open, and checked out the chat between my wife and her friend.  The main parts I got from this conversation were that my wife was one of her PTs favourite clients and that she had been invited to predrinks at his house, her friend also offered to be her 'wingman' so she could chase The Rock on the dance floor later in the night. So this is why I was uninvited I guess.  



I don't really want this to become about me checking through her messages, but I will if I have to. I don't think she is cheating, he has a lot of girls chasing him looking at his insta, and I don't know why he'd bother with a married woman.



Part of me wants to leave this be, part of me wants to confront. Any advice on how to approach this?

Link to my original post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5alqz3/my_boyfriend_29m_of_6_years_cheated_on_me_26f_he/


I got a couple messages asking how its going so I thought I would write a quick update on the situation. Before, I start I just want to thank everyone for all the really kind messages – at the time it felt really nice to be reassured by total strangers that it would be ok.


I left him and I am currently staying with my parents. It’s not an ideal situation because they live ~3 hours away and me and my mom do not have a great relationship. But I am super grateful that they are helping me out as I couldn’t have done this without them. My son is in pre-k a couple days a week now and I have got a part-time job in a hotel. 


It is hopefully not permanent - I’m planning to get my own place. I think my parents would rather help with rent then actually have me live them with them as it puts less strain on them and will stop me and my mom killing each other. In the long-term I would like to finish school but we will see what happens. 


So my ex. When I left, he was calling me all the time begging me to come back, apologising etc. One day I went back to get some of my stuff and when I got in he was really aggressive with me, asking why I was there and wouldn’t let me past the door. I pushed past him and the reason he didn’t want me there was because she was there. So the whole time he was begging me to come back and telling me it was over with her, was a total lie.


Honestly, it made it a whole lot easier for me to leave him when I realized he wasn’t sorry at all. I originally had this idea we could be amicable because of our son but I don’t think that’s going to happen. He has said some really hurtful things to me and I’ve probably said things to him I shouldn’t have. We have at least kind of arranged visitation/child support but I think we will maybe need to see a lawyer, especially if my relationship with him deteriorates even more


Overall, things are ok. It’s not been easy but I am just grateful we have some kind of stability over Christmas. In the new year I plan to really do this by myself but I want my son to have a good Christmas as he will probably this year so I don’t want to make any more big changes until then.

**EDIT:** I want to thank everyone for the support once again :) it's been much appreciated. I'm going to stick around on this account for a bit because my now ex knows my primary account and I want to fly under the radar. I'll stay anonymous on this account but feel free to message me if you need any advice and I'll be on subs like r/anxiety and r/ADHD and r/chronicpain :) 
 

I'd like to thank everyone for all the support and advice the other night when I posted the question. I decided to wait until this weekend because I was supposed to do something with his family and his family was nothing but sweet to me...or so I thought.

Tonight gave me the perfect opportunity to break up with him. I was supposed to go to his house tomorrow night and when I asked him what the plan was, he told me ""Eat dinner before you come because we're eating together as a family. Maybe you can get some Chipotle before you come over."" I asked him ""Why am I not invited?"" and he said ""I don't know, but I'll ask"". He texted me that ""My dad said we don't have enough food or space for me."" 

It was lovely to know that his family has been two-faced to me this entire time and that they don't want to welcome me, but that's beside the point especially since I don't give a shit anymore. I told him ""All I wanted was to feel welcome and accepted in someone's life. I'm done dealing with all of this and I deserve someone who respects all of me and who will stand up to their family when something isn't just."" 

He got pissed about how ""I am disrespecting him"" and how ""standing up to his family would disrespect him."" Then he went on about how ""they pay for the mortgage so he can't tell them what to do."" I told him ""Yeah, like you don't pay my rent like you shouldn't be telling me what to do."" 

He asked why we can't just be peaceful? and I told him to stop texting me and leave me alone. I haven't heard from him since and I feel relieved finally. I'm a bit sad, but it's more disappointment it didn't work out. I know that I'll have a happy life and find someone who will love me eventually.

"My brother [27m] does some really creepy stuff and I'm [21f] done with him.


Well, hey Reddit. I'm desperate.

My brother is really really creepy. Like really fucking creepy to the point where I look at him and I have serial killer thoughts. Then I realize what I'm thinking and I feel guilty.

Yesterday, for example. He picked me up at the uni and was supposed to take me to the mall, because I needed to buy some things. I realized the route was different and I asked him where he was going. He didn't say anything. I kept asking where we were going because I knew we were far away from the uni and he was driving faster and faster and I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. Then he casually went back to the mall, I got out of the car and said he didn't need to drive me back. He just went away.

Sometimes on holidays I'll be alone and he'll stand behind me and scare me. I told him multiple times to stop and he didn't. He's been doing it since we were kids. Sometimes I would wake up and see him standing in front of me while I slept. Last Thanksgiving I was sleeping and woke up to him sitting on the edge of my bed, speaking french (?????????). 

Sometimes he'll show up at my college and ask to talk to me. I'll get off class and then he'll just say it was ""nothing"" and go away. Sometimes I see his car parked at my boyfriend's house. I don't understand it. I'm done with him. What can I do?

"[UPDATE]My(26F) fiancé (27M) lied about his past crush to keep her as a close friend, should I give him a second chance


Hello again my fellow redditors, more than half a year ago I posted this question when I was on the verge of breaking up. All of your responses and PMs have really helped me and now I'm finally ready for an update. 


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4eamhk/my26f_fiancé_27m_lied_about_his_past_crush_to/


So, back to 7 months ago, after avoiding his calls and texts for three days and reading all your analysis many many times, I decided to talk to him. One of the comments really stood out to me is that the incident - and I quote - ""reveals a lot about this man's problems with emotional intimacy too, which is so unattractive"" and I was going to focus on this point that truly bothers me, rather than debating on whether or not he was telling a white lie.


Ben looked like the saddest and most frightened little animal when he came up to my hotel and begged me to let him speak first. Basically, he said that he had a crush on Pia when he was lonely and going no where in life and romanticised the idea of her by proclamimng Pia to be the dream girl to his friends, because he desperately wants to have something worth mentioning in his letters. He has since got a really good job in his field, met me who he not only has the biggest crush on, but also want to spend the rest of his life with. He kept inviting Pia because she has been part of the gang for a few years now and he genuinely thought she is good friends with everyone so it would be rude to un-invite her. As to why lie again and again about the crush, he thinks he was really lying to himself because it reminds him of that desperate and unconfident version of himself who he no longer is. Then he apologised again about the confusion and pain he brought me in the past year and begged me to stay.


I didn't think he'd came to that conclusion himself and thought it's both humiliating and kind of brave to do it. I do love this man, especially knowing that he has had some tough years, I have always been proud of who he is right now. So I decided to stay, and observe, while working on my own self esteem and jealousy issues.


We called of the wedding saying that we both have very demanding careers in the coming year (true) but stayed engaged. Ben made an effort in showing me how much he loves me, leaving me notes and little gifts almost every week. He also stopped initiating contact with Pia and has so far received one Facebook msg from Pia wishing him a happy birthday. He mentioned it to me when he saw the msg last month, and started to blame himself again for trying to make Pia more special than she is and hurting me, but I stopped him right there. I must admit that I've been on edge and constantly angry for the first few months after the incident, but no more. None of us is flawless and I'm glad that we get to grow together as a couple. 


Last night's event was what prompt me to post this update. Ben loves to write and he has read me the short stories he wrote 3 or 4 years ago about another major crush/almost girlfriend of his, whom he met while volunteering abroad in his early twenties. He has very found memories of the volunteering experience and spoke highly of her. This particular girl contacted him yesterday arranging a meet up in our city. I didn't tense up like I used to and didn't feel insecure or jealous. Ben went on to say that he has politely declined and wish to spend the weekend with me, and want to take me to a nearby Christmasy town, as we've both been very busy recently and haven't been on as many dates.


So that's it I guess. No more lies and doubts, just communication and understanding. I want to write down this update to let people know that it's possible to rebuild trust, just be honest with yourself and with each other. It's ok to be vulnerable in front of each other and if you can help each other through it, you will grow stronger together as a couple.

"I [21 F] want a guinea pig, my boyfriend [21 M] doesn't want one. We live separately. What do I do?


First of all, I feel like I'm being pretty whiny and a bit bitchy about this all, but I want to know how others view this. (I had a messed up childhood so lots of times I don't know if I'm being reasonable ore not).

My boyfriend, Peter (not his real name) loves playing video games, A LOT. I spend most of my time after school at his house. We pretty much never go over to my house, because my bed isn't that comfy (it really isn't) and his computer isn't there. Also, his house doesn't allow pets so the piggies would be living at my house. 

 Anyways, I've been wanting a guinea pig for AGES. I had them as a kid, I've had bunnies, I know how to take care of them. My roommates are okay with me having a piggie or two, as long as they get to have free cuddles and they get to name them. My boyfriends argument for me not getting them is that I wouldn't be spending much time at his place because of this. However, he plays HOURS upon HOURS of video games and wants me there while he plays. This makes me SO annoyed, because I don't have much to do and want to do my own thing. If I have plans with friends, then all is good, but I just HATE spending time in his room while he's playing games. He doesn't want me to leave and go to my place if he does. He also rarely makes plans with his friends. I know it's a hobby, and I know he loves it. I know he's allowed to play them and its not a biggie, but it still bugs me because I feel like I can't do anything but watch Netflix and sew (and who want's to do that for 3-6 hours a day?).  I think having piggies will help me mentally, would give me things to do while he goes playing his games and wouldn't make me angry at him all the time and we only live down the street from one another. I could take care of them and spend time with them while he plays games. I think this makes perfect sense, but he wants me with him 24/7...even if he's not spending quality time with me and vice versa. 

Pretty much I feel like I'm always waiting for him to be free from his video games and it makes me antsy and frustrated and I KNOW that just going down the block and spending time with the guinea pigs would make it all work out for me. He also tend to blame me (unless he's actually played for over 6 hours) for being annoyed when he plays. 

I just thinks this would solve everything, give me a bit more time to be my own person and not have me be annoyed with him when he plays games. How do I convince him that we would still be speniding time together, even if I were to have piggies? Should I just go get them without debating it more with him? Am I overreacting? What do I do? 
  
Thank you!

"My best friend [27M] of thirteen years is bringing home his new fiancee [21F]. I [28F] want to make sure she likes me and feels comfortable!


My best guy friend from high school is bringing his fiancee to our hometown for the holidays. She seems like a really cool chick and I'm so excited to meet her! However, my relationship with my best friend is a little more complicated than I would expect her to be 100% comfortable with. After high school, we fooled around for a little while - a purely FWB relationship. It was like we were just two buds who also happened to be getting our physical needs met from each other, and I think it actually ended up cementing our platonic relationship in the end. Like, we knew we just weren't into each other as boyfriend and girlfriend and there was a very natural transition to friends without benefits. 

Presently I have a handsome husband and two young kids, and I love my family dearly. I have no attraction to my best friend. It's been about eight years since our last little fling, and I'm not sure if she has this information or not. Obviously, we're not going to be talking about it. But, in her situation, I think I might feel a little weird or uncomfortable either way. I don't want to give her bad vibes. 

I really want her to like me and I really want her to be comfortable with my friendship with her fiance. I'm worried she won't approve, though I realize that that is her prerogative and I'm not going to overstep my boundaries if she doesn't. However, this is my oldest and favorite friendship in my life. What are some ways I can welcome her to our hometown, make her feel comfortable, and make sure I get to keep my friendship? 


Some other points to consider:

*I am friends with her on social media. I can see from her Facebook statuses that she is a little bit dramatic and has some issues with jealousy and insecurity. I think it's just because she's young (not bashing or trying to be condescending - I just remember how much less mellow I was myself just seven years ago). 

*When he last came to town, they had this big video chat where they went from having an open relationship to him not being allowed to hang out with another girl alone. I'm not sure if this was because of me or not. My friend didn't think it was about me, and he thought hanging out at my house was fine because my kids were always with me, but I made sure we only met up at public places (even though I can't kick his ass at Smash at parks and restaurants and his family's houses).

*My own amazing husband is super-chill with the situation; he was even giving my best friend advice when he and his lady first started dating.

*I'm very close with my friend's family and I'm sure we'll be hanging out at his mom's and brother's a lot (like we usually do when he's in town). I don't want to eclipse her blossoming relationships with them by being my usual boisterous and rowdy self and acting like I'm family. Do I tone it back a bit?

*She's from a Central American country and by the tone of her Facebook messages, I can tell she's a little bit frightened and angry (understandably) about how certain people in our country are treating our Latino neighbors. I live in a redneck state where everybody flies Confederate flags even though we were never part of the South, but I want to show her I can be a good advocate for minorities.

*She speaks Spanish and my friend has learned her language. I understand Spanish really well from working in kitchens my whole life, and I can speak it a little. Do I need to disclose this info? I kind of thought it would be cool to figure out how she was feeling about me and shift my behavior accordingly, but I don't want to be sneaky.

Thanks for reading my long post!

"My boyfriend [22m of 8 months] suddenly started smelling like.... ammonia?! What do I do?


My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now. We are both in our 20s and attend the same college.

When we started dating I loved his scent, he just smelled like a guy, nothing strange or abnormal about it (and no I was not, and have never been on hormonal birth control or hormones of any sort, and I am not pregnant).

A few weeks ago he suddenly started smelling like ammonia! Sometimes more strongly than others. I first noticed it when he came over for a night and hugged me. I thought that maybe he was using a new, weird lotion or had been to a friend's who has a cat (but I don't think any of his friends own a cat...). The smell wasn't offensive in the way that others can be, but I definitely found it unpleasant.

Later on that week it was either gone, or fainter.

Then, I slept over at his place this time. Normally his room smells fine. The smell was really strong! His room has a general guy funk and weed smell, but he was the only thing in there that smelled like ammonia. Now my hair smells like if from sleeping next to him all night!

I asked my roommate if she could smell it and she said that it smelled like ammonia hair dye, but that it wasn't that strong on me.

The smell is not of cat pee or anything, but he smells like.. a clean litter box? I don't know!

I googled it and there are some possible medical conditions that can cause someone to smell like ammonia. I really don't know what it could be.. but I can't really stand this anymore.

It definitely isn't a hygiene issue because he showers every morning.

How do I address this with him? He's the kind of person that does t really think anything is a big deal and probably wouldn't take me seriously if I suggested that there could be a medical reason.

I need to do something asap because it's really hard to kiss him and/or stay the night!



**EDIT:** WOW. I did not expect this post to receive SO much attention. Thank you to everyone who commented. I didnt realize that it could be something as serious as what has been suggested, I still hope that it isn't. I will definitely talk to him.

**tldr:** my boyfriend randomly started smelling like ammonia and I don't know how to address the issue."
"My (25f) coworker (24m) no longer wants to be friends and is threatening me and demanding I pay him back for Christmas gifts


Hi everyone. Sorry if this is a bit long, I'm lost on how to proceed with this situation, I'd really love your insight  .. I have worked at my job for about 6 months in an office above the warehouse for a large company. Not sure if this is relevant, but everyone in my office is older, ranging from 40-60+ 

I had been battling with an abusive ex boyfriend after breaking things off prior to working there, which I confided in one of the office ladies about (60f). She asked me one day if there was anyone in the warehouse I thought was cute or would consider dating, and I named John. She tracked him and got him number for me (without me asking). Her husband had worked very closely with John before retiring.

We end up texting, hanging out and kissed. I met with him later that week to explain I wasn't interested in dating and I needed to step back from whatever this was as my ex was still bothering me. We decided to be just friends. 

He asked if I'd like to do a Christmas gift exchange and I agreed, but only if we set up a price limit, which he said no don't worry about price. I figured $50 maximum! During that time I asked him to glance into a store window on his way home from work for a Himalayan Salt Lamp because I was pretty sure I had spotted them at that store. My plan was to wait to hear if they had them and drive out there to buy one for myself. I don't hear from him. He buys me a lamp for $45. I was bummed because I really wanted to pick my own out. I thanked him for it and told him I'd keep it as my Christmas gift. He said no it was a nice gesture from him.

He then bought me a $70 sweater online and got my name printed on the back of a hockey jersey as my Christmas gifts. So now I'm feeling like this has gotten out of hand. I barely know this guy and he's spending so much on gifts for me and I feel obligated to match the price on my gifts back. He tells me he'd also like a salt lamp $50 and a Blue Jays jersey $120

While all of this gift madness was going on, we had made plans to hang out after work one day. I started feeling sick and left work 3 hours early. He called me that night and told me he was coming to drop the lamp off for me, I tried to tell him no as I was sick, but he insisted. Literally would not take no for an answer. He invited me to his house last Saturday to watch his dad play music, but I had already made plans for a friend's bday. Then Friday comes along and we have plans to go for dinner. I get a call from my brother crying saying his girlfriend of 4 years broke up with him because she found out she can't have kids. I cancel plans with Johns to spend the night with my brother.

John tells me he's done trying to hang out with me because things keep coming up when we have plans aka me being sick and having prior commitments... I tell him I'm sorry and that if he doesn't want to be friends then I'll have to respect that. He gets upset that I'm preoccupied helping my brother and asks for the lamp back, then tells me to ""actually keep the stupid lamp"".. losing it over text.

Anyways... last night I miss his call. I text him ""busy what's up"" and he then tells me we need to talk. I respond saying there's nothing really left to say, and that I'd bring the lamp back on Monday. 

John: ""if you bring any tension or drama to work I will expose you, Your hoodie for Xmas just got processed so it's non-refundable now. There's a jersey I can't take back either. Could you get me a salt bowl and an Aaron Sanchez jersey like you promised?""

Me: ""John I'm trying to be nice and civil. Sorry it's gotten to this point. You asked me for the lamp back and I'm going to respect that and bring it on Monday.""

John: ""What the hell do I do with your other gifts I can not refund tho? Can you get me those things to offset it or pay me 160$ please?""

Guys... I barely know this person. I don't know what threatening to ""expose"" me even means. I looked up the return policy for the hoodie's website and he can request a return as it hasn't even shipped yet.
I think giving the lamp back is enough because he can return the sweater or regift it to one of his female friends? He's the one who said he's done trying to be my friend.... what the hell do I do?

"I [F55] just met my boyfriend's [M55] ex girlfriend [F37] and I'm shattered.


Older than your average here, I'm sure, but my daughter suggested when I didn't want to delve into relationship details with her. Thanks for listening.

I'm a 55 yo divorced woman and I've been seeing my boyfriend ""Russ"" now for almost three years. We moved in together earlier this year. He's also divorced, I've met his ex wife and grown kids and no issues there, so this is why I'm stunned the ex girlfriend hit so hard.

Long story short, he started dating this woman ""Amber"" right as he separated from his wife. It's a little cloudy how that went down, friends of his saying the divorce was already happening, friends of hers saying Amber was the nail in the coffin. Anyway, they were a couple through the divorce and broke up a year or so after it became final when she moved to a neighboring city. Again, I'm a little fuzzy how the breakup went down. He says it was mutual, rumors say *she* left *him*.

I know they talk, he's never hidden that from me, but there's something about her that still carries this air of, I don't know, mystery. He's offered to introduce us when she comes to town but I've always avoided it. I don't know why.

So last night we all end up at a holiday event. Amber is there, in fact she texted Russ ahead of time to let him know she would see him there. He puts on the nicest suit he owns. Favorite tie. Cuts his hair that afternoon. For the hour we were there before she arrived he was scanning the room nonstop. Finally she shows and (of course!) she's ridiculous stunning. They weren't flirting by any conventional standard but the chemistry was running off of them. Maybe I'm being dramatic but they looked like the most connected couple in the room, not touching, just in sync?? To be fair, I watched her with other people that night and she's the type who can charm anyone in a conversation, but how my boyfriend looked after her was not like he's ever looked at me.

I feel like I'm the relationship he thinks he should have, but she's the one he CRAVES. 

I finally point blank asked a friend why they split and he said because the ex wife had the kids so convinced Amber caused the divorce that they wouldn't accept her and she refused to be in the middle of a ""pick me or pick the kids"" scenario. Now she's married, his kids have figured out the truth of sorts, and I feel like he regrets letting her walk away.

I don't want to leave because of another woman he'll obviously never get, but can I stay knowing I'm the second choice?
  
  **tl;dr**: My [F55] boyfriend [M55] obviously is still very much in love with his ex [F37]. He can't have her so I'm not worried about him cheating, but how do I get over knowing she was ""the one??"""
"[UPDATE] My (21M) family just had an intervention with me regarding my GF (27F) of two years. I am so broken. I know what I need to do, but I lack the wherewithal to do it.


Previous post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5f7bp7/my_21m_family_just_had_an_intervention_with_me/


First off, big thanks to everyone who supported me. Thank you to everyone who has messaged me, thank you for everyone who commented. I read through your posts multiple times, including one final time before I sent my final text to ""Jessica.""


Yes, I broke up with her tonight, not even an hour ago. After so long, I finally did what had to be done. And it sucks. It sucks even more than I thought I would, and I knew it was going to be one of the hardest parts of my life so far. 


I feel a lot of things right now. Sad. Happy. Angry. Exhausted. energetic. The whole range. I miss her already, but the barrage of texts she sent me after words solidified my position more than any advice. And it followed no reasonable narrative either. She would just switch from bitter attack to sweet talk. 


It is going to be a long, hard road. I know that, but I'm glad I've made my decision. Again, thank you so much to all who commented. You came to me when I was completely broken and helped give me the strength I needed to do what had to be done.


It is funny.... In the final moment all I could think of what the scene in Game of Thrones where John Snow says, ""I'm tired of fighting."" I have no idea why that stuck out and became so poignant in my mind, but it did.


Again... Thank you, thank you, thank you. I can't think you all enough.

"I [17F] will get a family tattoo once I get 18. Boyfriend [18M] doesn't want me to and is very upset that I will still want to do it.


We have a little family tradition that at 18 you'd get a special tattoo. Everyone in our family does it and I want to do it too. When I told my boyfriend about it, he said he doesn't like tattoos and he doesn't want me to do it. I explained that this is tradition and it's important to everyone in my family and I've been wanting to do it for a very long time but his response has been ""you don't care about what I think.""

And he's been distant ever since. We've been together for 1 year and we like each other. We didn't have any issues until now.

"My [16F] boyfriend [16M] and his brother [17M] are well known football players around my school. They have a freshmen brother [14M] who comes here. The coach just called him ""The useless brother"" when he said he can't sign up because of his .


Hi, so I am on my phone at the moment. I'm currently at school. My school was having this weird thing for freshmen. It was like a information session on athletics. I don't know why of all times they chose to do it now. I was there talking about volleyball to some of the girls because that's what I play. 

Now I don't know what exactly is wrong with his brother, the medical name for it. But he broke his neck 2 years ago and had surgery preformed. You would never know anything was wrong with him when you look at him, he appears perfectly normal. It's when he's home you really start to see it. He just seems to have trouble doing things like putting shirts on and lifting heavy things. 

The Coach Mr. J walked up to him and asked is he signing up for Football in the future. I heard him say he has a bad neck and can't play football, doctor said under no circumstances. Which I also see around their home, his brothers are not rough with him like they are with each other. 

Mr. J then looked around I'm assuming to make sure no other teachers were there and said ""To bad, I had high hope for you. Guess you're the Useless brother"" and literally walked off. I just stood there and it's like did this dude actually just say that. 

He walked out and I assume he went home. He took his bag, did not listen to a word I said and left. 

I want to know what to do in this situation. 

TL;DR: I am dating a well known football player from my high school. The coach called his younger brother with neck issues the useless one."
"Pregnant and handicapped sister [24F] upset I won't change my [20F] social life for her.


I have two siblings. I am closest with Mike [25M] who lives and works in Australia. He graduated at 17, went to community college, applied to an Australia university and has been there since. He is dating someone and they plan to get married in four years. I have been to see him twice since he moved 3 years ago. I absolutely love the area.

Mike and I were talking about some issues I am having with our half-sister Jen [24F] [same absent father, different mothers] and how I wanted to get away from town for a loooong time. He offered to let me stay with him if I wanted to take a year off. 

I worked it out and I leave in June. 

So here is the real issue and one I kind of want to work on before I leave. I feel like time away from Jen will be good for *both* of us, but I am not sure if this is true. Maybe I am hopeful the issue will solve itself magically while I am gone and I can return home without issues. 

Just to add: Mike and Jen do not really talk. Mike has pretty much limited their contact to every three months. 

---

*Background* 

Growing up, my Mom [45F] made a lot of effort to keep in touch with Jen's Mom Clara [50F] so Jen could be in our lives. It worked for the most part, I was close with Jen until 2015 when she was in a car accident. 

It has been almost two years and Jen has yet to accept she is likely handicapped. Or limited. I am not sure what the right word is, especially because Jen won't accept any implication she is not 100% at all times. This includes aggravating her issues by attempting to go for long walks. Then she has to call someone to pick her up and take her home, because she forgot her cane and refuses to admit she tried too hard. 

I am not even sure the full extent of everything because she clams up and doesn't talk. I know sometimes she can't get out of bed, her knee is fucked up. She was in a car accident because her boyfriend, at the time, decided to drive a car with bad breaks. So she has been through a lot. Her boyfriend [30M] was injured and broke up with her afterwards. He is fine now, he has no long standing issues [I know because Jen cried about it for months.] 

I am sorry if I am coming off rude about Jen. I had sympathy for her, until she started to blame me for everything. I go to the beach, she calls me to scream about how I never include her. I do anything and she turns it into a sign I don't love her. She wants to work out with me, but gets pissed off I want to do more than ten minutes of slow, painfully obnoxious conversation with her about how she doesn't have to do all the work I do to look hot. 

I work out a lot, I run, I hike, I go on long trips with friends. All of this makes Jen fume. She tries to ruin the trips by pretending she is hurting when she is not. I got played twice by that and now I don't even talk to her about anything. Even breathing pisses her off. 

I think she actually hates me for everything. I have a boyfriend, she hates me. I don't have a boyfriend, she hates me. I lose ten pounds, she hates me. I gain ten pounds, I look like a heffer and she still hates me. I am at a loss.

I don't know what to do with this. I hate her attitude and wish she would just stop calling me. But then I feel bad because she has driven everyone but her mother away. 

What do I do? 

**TL;DR** Injured sister is miserable I am happy and I am not sure if I end the relationship or not?

TLDR: Missing link everyone wanted? My brother's fiancée is uncomfortable with me being a lesbian and my sister is just in it for the drama. 

[original post](https://redd.it/5e8b1t)

First off, thanks to everyone who responded to my post (and I mean everyone, no matter how harsh you were with me), but especially thanks to those who shared their own stories with me. Putting your own experiences out there, no matter which side you are on this, takes guts, so thanks. I read all your responses and tried to comment until the post was locked (not to sure why that happened.) I thought about everything you guys wrote, which ranged from me being a blameless scapegoat in a family of a-holes to me keeping my head in the sand about what a heinous abuser I was to my brother. Like most truths, the answer seems to be somewhere in the middle. 

After I posted I spent the next day or two thinking back on my actions as a teen and how they may have affected D. A lot of what was written in the responses didn't really fit, honestly, I never hit D, I rarely teased or yelled at him. None of my angst was directed at him, but a couple of people brought up that the tense environment I created still could have affected him. So I focused on that, and sat down and wrote an email. I apologized for being unpleasant, and creating a nasty environment at home. I apologized for dragging his name into my rages at my mom (things like, ""why do I have to do xx chore, when D doesn't?"" since he was always getting ready for some practice or game.) I apologized for calling his sports dumb and useless and comparing them to the Roman circuses to distract the masses. (yeah, I was so ""edgy"" as a teen.) In my email I told D I had been reflecting on our past and felt bad about how I treated him, and welcomed him to talk to me if he ever wanted. I didn't bring up A or B, I didn't make excuses, and I didn't bring up the wedding or why I wasn't going home for Thanksgiving. It seemed short and light, but I did feel better after I sent it off.

Then I confirmed that I was still welcome at my gfs house, bought flowers to bring my gfs parents and sent some to my mom to apologize for missing out on Thanksgiving. At my gf's family's house, I had a great time meeting everyone! It was so nice, and I think a pretty big step in our relationship. So that was all good.

But then, yesterday, B calls me up and asked ""did you hear what happened?"" I said no, that mom had called to see how my time with my gf's family went, but she didn't say anything about their weekend. So B proceeds to tell me that when the family was eating pie, my dad asks where I am (thanks for noticing I'm gone Dad!), and my mom reminds him that I'm at my gf's family, and that maybe I'd be home for Christmas. Then D brings up that I sent him an email apologizing for being terrible during our teenage years. Mom (trying to be neutral, I guess), asks if he is going to respond. Before D can say anything, D's fiancée (F) chimes in with ""well, she's still not invited"". My mom agrees that they can invite whoever they want. And F continues on about how they only want ""people who bring them joy to be at the wedding"" and I ""wouldn't be comfortable there anyway since it was a dressy occasion."" (this is news to me that I'm allergic to dressing up, since I dress up all the time for work and going out). And then (some of you guessed it) F finishes her speech with the fact that ""most of the people at her parent's church wouldn't be comfortable seeing me and my gf there."" My mom expressed how sad she was that there were still intolerant communities out there and that I and my gf would always be welcome at her house, and left the table to do the dishes. So there it is, I honestly had no idea F felt this way. Maybe she doesn't, and it's her parents or church community she's appeasing, but still, I was pretty floored when B told me this. 

At this point in the conversation B stops and says ""can you BE-lieve it?? F hates that you are a lesbian!! That's why they don't want you there!"" I stop her and say ""wait, I thought I was a toxic person?"" B says ""that doesn't seem to be the issue, huh?"" I say ""you said you didn't blame D for not wanting me there, and that I was awful to him, what did you mean by that, how awful was I?"" B doesn't really give any specifics and just says ""well, you were pretty bitchy and rude back then."" Then B tries to steer the conversation back to F, snarking about how dumb it is that F ""only wants people who brings them joy"" at the wedding when F is so intolerant of others. At this point, I ask B why she's telling me all this, and B says ""well, I thought you'd want to know how F really feels about you. I'd want to know if someone hated me."" This is all giving me a bad feeling, so I thank her and end the conversation. 

Where I'm at now: 

D: Clearly my email meant something to him since he brought it up in a non-derogatory manner at their Thanksgiving. I do hope we can talk sometime. I'm thinking what happened was, in the course of talking about his childhood while he was getting to know F, he brought up how tense I made things, and that was enough of an excuse to write me off from the wedding without going straight to the lesbian thing. 

B: My sister is a very unreliable narrator, and I think she just wants to gossip and relishes in the drama. When the family headline was ""D hates me for his childhood"" she was so quick to pile on with the ""I don't blame him"" line. Then it comes out F doesn't feel comfortable with me and my gf, and she dials it back to ""you were a little bitchy, but not bad"" and switches to ""it's crazy F hates you!!!"". I'm glad she told me, because it definitely gives me insight into the whole situation. But I don't think she was telling me to reassure me that I wasn't toxic, but rather to see how I reacted to F's opinions about me, maybe mining for more drama? 

A: I guess I could ask A about how she thinks I acted as a teen, but according to B, A and B's response to my email to D was ""when will you apologize to us?"" uhhh....yeah, I don't know about that. If they are just going to blame me for being awful, and use this for gossip and drama, well then I don't know if I really owe A and B an apology. 

Anyways, thanks for reading, sorry its another novel. Hope you enjoyed this update and have a little more insight into all my family dynamics. I know I do. Now I can go to Christmas without fear of being the ""awkward unwelcome one"", and instead be on the lookout for instigating behavior from B, or passive aggressiveness from F. "

She said she is serious and she will block his access to me if he doesn't agree to pay. She said I have two weeks to convince him to pay otherwise I won't see him again until I'm 18. 

I don't know what to do. Do I tell my brother? Do I continue to try to convince my mom that she shouldn't do this? How do I do that?

"My (20M) GF (30F) told me to forgive the people who abused me (update)


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5enr14/my_20m_gf_30f_told_me_to_forgive_the_people_who/

I don't know if some of you remember my post. I was very surprised to see all the reactions, I hadn't expected so many people to react on it.


After long consideration, I tried to break up with Ela 2 days ago. I went to her place and we talked, I told her that recently I had been really sad, because I was thinking of what my ex did to me and also because my feelings for Ela weren't the same anymore.



She cried,begged me to stay, told me she had never loved me, that she just 'liked' me, then she grabbed me and held thight so I couldn't leave, she didn't let met take my stuff, she begged me again to stay, told me the alarm on her phone didn't work so I had to stay. She also used the personal thing she told me against me 'I told you this, you were the only one'.



I told her I needed a break from her, and yesterday I went back, to find er very calm, she had written down things she was sorry for, and I gave in.


However, when she initiated to have sex with me it felt so bad and uncomfortable. I realised that this was the ultimate proof that it was over.



I told her this morning that despite her changes in behaviour, which I had appreciated, I didn't feel it anymore. I assured her that the personal things she told me had nothing to do with this, and that if ever she needed me she could contact me, but that our relationship was over.


She accepted it. Thanked me for the wonderfull time she had had with me and that she knew she would 'never find someone' like me again, but that she had ruined it herself. She told me that she loved me but that she wanted to see me happy, even if it wasn't with her and that she would never forget me.



I hope one day I will find someone who treats me well (all the time), I'm still young, hopefully I will one day. Right now I will try to focus on my studies and working on myself in therapy, I need to learn how to set boundaries and remark red flags.


So, despite the fact that I feel like a jerk and that I am surprisingly sad, I would like to finish this post by thanking you all for your reactions. 
It meant more to me than you guys will ever know and touched me a lot. I hope that your reactions will help others the way it has helped me.

"Coworkers [40sFs] are pressuring me into multiple holiday gift exchanges I can't really afford to participate in [32F]


Sorry if this is long, I wanted to give the full details. I understand if you want to skip to the TL;DR.

I've been at my current job for about 4 months now, so I'm still the new girl. 

A little background; the office employees are all women, there are about 25 of us and I'm the youngest at 32. There are 4 managers. Most of the women are in their 40s or above, with semi-wealthy, retired husbands and you can tell they don't really have to work if they don't want to. Many of them go to the same church and all are extremely religious, so I'm already a bit of an outcast here.

I make just over $9/hr, and my financial situation has been very tight this year. My husband lost his job and I lost mine (we both worked retail and the company reorged), so we have both had to take pay cuts in our new positions, basically starting from scratch at new companies. He makes little more than me, just over $10. 

Between our car payments, insurance, and rent we can barely afford to feed ourselves. We applied for food stamps and were denied because we have about $4k left in our savings account that was supposed to go towards the purchase of our first home.
(we have already had to dip into it multiple times over the past 4 months just to keep ourselves fed and our bills on time) We are trying really hard not to spend it because, like I said, it was supposed to be for our first home.

Back to the work situation:

It started with an email. One of the managers was collecting money to get a gift for the HEAD manager, and instructed that the money be left for her in an envelope on her desk with our name clipped to it. 

A few days went by, and I did not contribute anything because quite honestly, I don't have anything. The manager sent another email reminding everyone to contribute and came to my desk before I left for the day, again reminding me that I hadn't contributed to the gift. 

I said, ""Listen, can I talk to you for a second,"" and I explained to her that money has been tight and that I wasn't able to contribute. I expected understanding, but instead she got kind of huffy with me and said, ""Well just so you KNOW, we do this every year and (manager) does something for each employee in the office."" She left before I really had a chance to discuss it with her further, and I sort of feel like I was being told I am expected to contribute. 

Since then, similarly ""mandatory"" collections have started for gifts for the other three managers, and a gift exchange is being done by all the workers on my shift.

We were sitting at our desks when one of them said jokingly ""I hope you all are getting me something nice this year because I just picked up your gifts today."" And they started discussing what day they wanted to exchange gifts. I kept quiet, until one of them called on me by name and asked if that day was good for me. 

I said, ""Oh, it's okay, I'm probably not going to participate."" They all got quiet and the one from before said ""But I already got you something."" and another spoke up and said, ""It's only $10 a person.""

Note: There are 5 others on my shift so even if we are doing $10 a person, that's about $50 that I do not have.

There was an awkward silence until I said, ""ok, thanks"". 

Since that happened, no one has really spoken to me. 

Now, to be honest, I was planning on quitting this job anyway, because as you can probably tell from this post it's not the most pleasant place to work. There is a lot of passive aggressiveness that goes on and I've already started looking for other jobs. However, I just don't know if I will be out before Christmas. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm dreading going to work and am having all kinds of anxiety about the holiday. We have already embarrassingly had to explain to our family and friends not to expect much more than a card this year because of our financial situation, and now I'm being gulited for not wanting to participate in five, yes five, gift exchanges at the office this year.

Even though I'm planning on leaving, it's no fun being the office pariah. How can I handle this situation with some dignity? 

**TL;DR: Coworkers are making me feeling guilty and refusing to accept no for an answer when I try to get out of holiday gift exchanges. I simply don't have the money this year. I am embarrassed and frustrated, how can I get out of this without making everyone hate me?**"

"My mother [51F] has decided that she wants another child. I [31F] worry that in the event of her death, there is no obvious person to care for it other than me. I am also planning to move away before too long.


My parents divorced after I was born, and my mother always wanted a second child. However, she was always looking for the right guy, and never found him. 

She recently announced during a dinner party at her home that she has been working with a fertility company and will be using a surrogate to carry a child.

Mom's only living relatives (other than myself) are in their 70s or older. Most of her friends are older than she is, as well. I do not have any siblings. In short, I believe that if something happened to her, I would be the obvious person to care for her child.

This concerns me because Mom has had a number of serious health issues including three hospitalizations and two surgeries in the past five years.  She has continuing health concerns.

I specifically do not want children myself, and I do not want to raise a child. While I hope that my mother will live many more decades, the reality exists that she is getting older and health concerns are likely to multiply.  My husband feels the same.

In addition, I suspect that even if her health is mostly good, raising a child will require some help.  I am not opposed to occasionally helping out, but I worry that the level of help may exceed what would be able to comfortably provide, especially because I don't expect to live in this area long-term. My husband's family lives in another state and we have discussed my requesting a transfer at my company so that he can take over his father's business within the next few years.  I can provide love and support from a distance at that point and travel back here for emergencies, but I won't be here on a regular basis.

I want mom to know that (a) she should have a plan for who will care for the child in the event that something happens to her, and (b) that she should have a plan for what to do if she needs day-to-day help.  (I have told her before that we expect to move out of the state at some point, but I don't know if it has crossed her mind with respect to this.  I also help her with day-to-day things now occasionally, so she may anticipate that will continue).

I believe I should tell her these things. However, I don't know how or when to have this conversation. I don't believe this would affect her decision to have a child, but I worry that she will take it negatively or see it as me being intentionally unsupportive.

  **tl;dr**: My mother is having another child. She is in her fifties, and I am the only logical person to take the child if something were to happen to her, but I do not want to have a child. I also plan to move away within a couple of years and worry that she may be expecting my day-to-day support long term, which I would then not be able to provide. I am not sure how to tell her these things (or if I should just not).

EDIT: I should add that I had already tried to discourage this and presented alternatives (this has been a topic of conversation for several years before she came to this conclusion), but it's her decision. Advice to convince her not to do this isn't really going to help me. You may be right, but it's her life and I can't prevent her from doing this."

"Me [43M] with my wife [21F] 20 years - I did something stupid at the start of our relationship and never said a word.


Edit: Title should be 41F, not 21. 

Yes, I'm a cheater and I don't quite know how to handle this situation now. I feel I have to own up, but I'm not sure how after all this time. I left my own country and came to a city in hers with a job offer in 1999 not speaking a word of her language (she spoke English just fine, we originally met in my country when she was on holiday)

The city I was in was far away from hers and we were in a long distance relationship for two years seeing each other perhaps every month, it wasn't the best situation but we made it work until I did something stupid on New Years Day 2000. There was a huge expat party I attended. I was being flirty with a girl not expecting it go anywhere and, well, it went somewhere. I woke the next day with her in my bed and felt like shit, I felt I had to tell my girlfriend I had betrayed her. It was completely my fault and I'm not trying to absolve myself of that. I started packing, started deciding what I was going to say and how I didn't really want to be in this country any longer because it made me do things I would never have done at home. I felt lonely and tired and trapped.

However she called me up the day after and told me her mother was having a cancer scare - she had to go to her hometown right away and needed me with her for this. I agreed, thinking we would talk at some point once this scare was over. Well, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I stopped drinking entirely (my last drink was in 2000), was much more self-aware around people. I learnt the language, made some local friends, dropped my old friends who were there for the easy money and my wife helped me through everything. She kept saying how she thought it may not work at the beginning but she saw this change in me, wasn't sure where it came from but was more in love with me than ever. 

So I buried it, I buried it at the bottom of my soul for 20 years and haven't given it much thought until recently because otherwise the guilt would kill me - which it now is. I want to tell her, but I have no idea where to even start... I even asked her if she'd want to know if I did anything and she told me no. See, the culture here is all about face and losing it or causing someone to lose it is a huge no. I know her family would pressure her to stay with me after I told her, even if she didn't want to... 

I also know I've robbed 20 years of life from my beautiful wife and never revealed what a bastard I could be.

I'm 28 M about to propose and we've already picked out the ring, but last night she (32F) informed me that she's still married.  She claims that it was for the husband, who is a family friend, to get his greencard.  I completely understand that logic, but I can't really understand why I was never told until now.  I get it if she wanted keep using the tax break until we got married, but waiting that long seems like there is more to the story.  The fact that she got married for that reason made me laugh, but then having something hidden from me is kind of unsettling.

"My [29/F] fiance's [32/M] ex-girlfriend [35?/F] texted him ""Are you sure you want to get married?""


OK, so I'm going to throw out all the relevant details so buckle up.

Background:  My fiance and his ex were together for 4 years.  During their whole relationship she had some mental health problems that prevented her from working, living independently, or driving.  They were long-distance until one day she showed up at the apartment he shared with a college buddy and moved herself in.  Since she couldn't work, he now had to support her in addition to himself; also, being home alone working all day, she started complaining a lot of being bored and lonely.  In addition, since she couldn't drive she was calling up his friends and asking them for rides any time she wanted to go somewhere.  After a year of this, he got tired of her being what he calls a ""moocher"" and asked her to go move back in with her parents.  At that point she started saying that they should get married, but they ended up breaking up shortly after that.  A few months later she started seeing another guy, and she married him two years later.  

Meanwhile, he met and started dating me a year after they broke up.  We've been together for 4 1/2 years.

Fast forward to this year:  we got engaged in February.  A few months later she texted him ""OMG are you engaged?  Congrats!  Your fiancee is gorgeous.""  A few days later she sent me a friend request on Facebook.  A few days after that, it seems, she was hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency.

Fast forward to yesterday, when I found out that a few weeks ago they had the following text conversation:

Her:  Hey can you call me when you get out of work?
Him:  Sure.
[a few hours go by]
Her:  Are you still at work?
Him: Yeah I get out a little late
Her: Oh that sucks
[a few minutes go by]
Her:  Are you sure you want to get married?
Him:  Yes I'm sure.  Did you still want me to call you?
Her:  No

What the hell?  She was her own husband, so I'm more than a little bothered that she's barging into my relationship.  I understand that she seems to be still mentally unwell, and that this is a manifestation of that (and I sympathize, because I have my own mental health struggles and I don't always act right) but this is not OK.

I don't know if I should do anything, and if so what:  should I message her and tell her to stop?  Tell my fiance to tell her to stop?  Ignore everything?  I have a fantasy of calling up her husband and saying something like, ""Tell your wife to leave my fiance alone.""

"Me [27F] with my fiance [27M], I want to turn on location sharing on our phones, he doesn't


Hey folks, maybe this is a silly problem I'd be interested to gather some opinions that may help to move forward this conversation with my fiance. This is kinda low-drama I'm afraid, not the most exciting post. 

So, Des and I have been together for 5 years, engaged for 1. We recently relocated and got new jobs in our new area. Des now cycles approximately 40 minutes to work, and I have bought a car and am driving to and from work (and drive all over the county for work appointments).

Des work shifts and its often dark when he's cycling one way or another, and much of his bike ride is on off-road cycle paths. It's also winter, so can be icey, foggy or raining. I am driving regularly for the first time in my life though my usual commute isn't very long.

I want us to turn on location sharing on our phones because I worry about Des cycling home in the dark or in bad weather. The thing is, if he were to come off his bike and hurt himself somewhere on the off-road track, and couldn't call for help, it would take hours for me to find him. I get a little anxious when he's late home because of this - if one day he just didn't show up because something had happened, I wouldn't even know where to start in terms of helping him. 

Now, I *know* this is so unlikely to happen. He has lights and safety gear and its a flat track. I know the chances are nothing will ever happen. But it would make me feel so, so much better if I knew that if that tiny chance came to pass I would at least be able to pin-point where he was. 

So, I asked Des if we could do this and he said no, flat out. He thinks it would be creepy and weird for me to be able to see where he is all the time. I have no intention of actually checking where he is unless I have reason to worry (I trust him completely, it's not even a question for me). I said he would be able to check where I was as well so its not one-sided and maybe it would make him feel better if I was doing a long drive or something. He doesn't think its worth it. 

Obviously this isn't going to reach break-up levels of disagreement, but I'm a bit put out that this is a fairly simple thing that is good for his safety and would make me feel better and he won't do it. But then I know my anxieties shouldn't define what he does or doesn't feel comfortable with. I've asked if he could just turn it on when he's cycling and keep it off the rest of the time, but he's not happy with that either and views this as a matter of principle. 

Opinions? Do I need to just let this go now and hope my anxieties fade as I get more used to him cycling in winter, is there another way we could talk about this that would help? 

If its relevant, there's no history in our relationship of either of us being untrustworthy or either of us snooping. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I want my fiance to turn on location services when he's cycling to and from work; he refuses. Time to suck it up and deal with his decision, or worth another conversation?

**EDIT/UPDATE:** Thanks everyone! I suggested using RoadID, which can send a crash alert but not share location data otherwise and Des is happy with that, as am I. And I will be thinking about the comments regarding managing anxiety as well; I definitely tend towards worse-case-scenario thinking when it comes to the safety of loved ones, and I need to work on that. I'm going to look into some of the resources folks have recommended.
