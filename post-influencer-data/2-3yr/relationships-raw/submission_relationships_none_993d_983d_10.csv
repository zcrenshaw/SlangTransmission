"[UPDATE] How do I [32 MtF] say thank you to my (foster) parents for being so amazing?


Original here:

https://nr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mb7li/how_do_i_32_mtf_say_thank_you_to_my_foster/

Sorry for not responding to any of the original comments. Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice. 

I did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own.

I took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc. 

I ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well. 

I would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished.

I didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture!

I gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person. 

This has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here! This was seriously an amazing experience.

"Update: My wife [30 F] has given up alcohol for good and I [31 M] am finding it difficult to deal with.


Today, I happened to stumble across this throwaway. Furthermore, I noticed that it happened to be the throwaway's cakeday so I think *someone* is prodding me to do an update on this!

I posted a year ago about how my wife had [given up alcohol for good and how I was finding it hard to deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40im59/my_wife_30_f_has_given_up_alcohol_for_good_and_i/).

I'd like to thank everyone that commented on the original thread. I did read everything even if I didn't reply to everyone. There were people who thought (as I expected) that I was selfish, that it shouldn't matter that my wife was making that decision and that I likely had my own hidden drinking problems. There were others, though, that understood and could see my point of view.

The TL/DR of my original post is that my wife had decided to give up alcohol for good, had told me she thought she was an alcoholic and so was going to quit. She was not an alcoholic in the 'traditional' sense i.e. she didn't get drunk all the time, wouldn't drink in the day but she did have two or three glasses of wine pretty much every evening after work. A lot of people do that. When she told me she was quitting booze for good, it was a complete shock to me and I felt a very real sense of loss. I really felt heartbroken because I felt like there would be things we would 'miss out' on in the future together - sharing cocktails by the pool on holiday, sharing a bottle of nice wine over a romantic candlelit dinner, popping a bottle of champagne on New Year's, toasting to our (currently non existent) children on their wedding days. I felt like that had all been taken away from me. I knew that this was small fry compared to what others went through and what she could be going through but that didn't stop it hurting. Everyone's problems matters to *them* even if an abstract observer can clearly see that one person's problems are much worse than anothers'.

When I googled for help and advice on the matter, nothing really came up so I want to keep my original post up and supply an update to let others that might go through the same thing that they're not alone.

As I mentioned above, some people were adament that my wife's decision to not drink ever again shouldn't affect me in the slightest. Basically, it had nothing to do with me and if I felt like it affected me then I had my own problems. A year on, I can defiantly tell those people that they are wrong. In a marriage, at least in the kind of marriage I believe in, you and your partner's actions and choices are intertwined. The whole point of a marriage is to *share* the rest of your lives together. I had expected and hoped for a long future together, sharing experiences that typically included alcohol. Our society, as a whole, is intertwined with booze. We first met when we were both tipsy at a student bar, pretty much all the social occasions we've ever been to have involved some alcohol - that's just where our society is. Drinking was, in some ways, a 'shared interest'. If you met a partner through rock climbing and you climbed together several times a week, got married, carried on climbing together all the time then suddenly your married partner said ""sorry, I'm never going to climb again"", you would feel hurt. Like something core to your relationship had been taken away.

So, what have I learnt in the past year? Well for one, your parter giving up booze really doesn't matter. You just adjust. I'd be lying if there were times that I miss us sharing a bottle of wine together but those thoughts are few and far between. It's far more important to me that she's happy and feels much better about herself. She's healthier, has a better outlook on life and when we are out togheter, we actually spend more 'quality' time together. I've never been a big drinker so if we were out, she'd get tipsier way before me so in a way, we weren't on the same conversation level by the end of the night. Now, we can talk 'properly' throughout. There are lots of benefits too, we spend much less on drinks now, of course - especially at home. We do, however, spend more on food. That's something I get more enjoyment from anyway though.

We've been on holiday, we've been to weddings, we've been out to loads of dinners, we've had Christmas together. It's all been fine. I always knew it would be - other people don't really judge much once you just say 'you don't drink'. As long as you don't make a big deal about it. My wife still doesn't tell people that she's an alcoholic; the story is still ""I gave up for dry January and found myself really liking it and felt better about myself so I gave it up for good"". It's just easier, makes less of an issue of it and draws much less attention. We're probably happier than we were before (although we were plenty happy then too). I love my wife and I love spending time with her.

For what it's worth, I do still drink. I didn't drink much before she gave up and now I do drink less. I'd share a bottle on nights out before but hardly ever drank at home. I'd say I had, on average, 2-3 units a week. Now I'm more at 0.5-1 units. I.e. Once every two or three weeks I might have a couple of beers. I hardly ever drink when we're out together. Only if I *really* fancy it. When I just 'quite fancy' it, I'd usually choose not to out of solidarity with my wife.

One change I have noticed is that I judge the shit out of restaurants that have a crappy soft drinks selection or lack of non-alcoholic cocktails. High end restaurants tend to have several great options and will go out of their way to cater to you. Other restaurants do seem to judge you for not getting a bottle of wine, likely because they make a healthy profit off of alchohol. Annoyingly, we're not doing it because we want to be 'cheap', we'd happily pay for an overpriced mocktail that's basically just tonic water with a cucumber in. I do enjoy being 'prepared' for my wife now though - i.e. if we're at a function where they're handing out champagne and nothing else, I will do what I can to get her something else; I'll happily be a bit of an arsehole if a place hasn't thought about providing non alcoholic drinks. There are plenty of people that can't drink for a number of reasons after all - religion, health pregnancy etc. Places really should be prepared.

I've rambled on for a while here, it's a bit disjointed as I wasn't planning on spending loads of my day writing about this! I'll happily answer any questions others may have. What with it being 'Dry January' for a lot of people, this could be something others might be thinking about.

I'd like to thank a few people from the original post for their comments; /u/gravityline and /u/Spectrum2081 for making me realise that it could have been a *lot* worse, she could have opted to go vegan instead which would have been bloody *awful*. u/lofwt and u/ShelfLifeInc for their points of view as non/little drinkers and for giving substitute suggestions. Also u/gooberfaced for saying that our life probably lacked any 'real' problems. That really made me laugh and see the truth in it!! There are many more that commented and helped in my original post but I can't list them all. Oh, also a shout out to r/stopdrinking; I got my wife to sign up to reddit for that sub and she's found it really helpful several times over the past year. :)

TL/DR: My wife decided a year ago that she was quitting alcohol for good as she felt she was an alchoholic. This was a shock for me, I didn't think she was and I felt feelings of loss at the thought of a future where we wouldn't drink occasionally togehter. A year on, everything's been fine, we're happier, she's healthier and still doesn't drink. It hasn't been a big deal. I still feel some feelings of loss but they're so insignificant now and I realise that. Life is great."

This may be a little weird? I don't know, I'm just looking for some advice on the issue. 

My husband grew up in a city environment, and never had to learn how to drive. I did when I was younger. When we started dating, I had to drive everywhere, which wasn't a big deal at the time and he always said he wanted to start sometime.

Now that we're married, I have to do EVERYTHING. Drive to friends houses, to the gym, get groceries, basically everything and I'm getting irritated. Now we're talking having kids, and I don't want to be the only one that drives in the house. What if the baby has an emergency and I'm not around? I hate having him dependent on me getting anywhere.

He says he doesn't want to start driving in case he kills anyone while driving, and he's scared of it. Which I do understand, but he hasn't even tried being behind the wheel! I don't know what to do, this has been our biggest argument lasting months. Can anyone give me advice? Anyone with kids where one spouse can't drive?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband and I want to start having kids, but not until he starts driving. He doesn't want to drive, says it doesn't matter if he can drive. Idk what to do.

EDIT: Hi everyone! I just woke up and will try to respond to you guys, thank you for all the advice! It really has been half people agreeing with me and half people siding with my husband, so at least I got to see the other side of things, haha. I showed him some comments on here and he agreed so take driving classes, if he is super scared he'll see someone about the anxiety, and I'm taking him on a golf course soon to help practice! And people asking if he can use public transport, where I live it's basically walk, drive or bike. So really not an option. Thanks everyone for your stories, really helped solve the situation :)"

Throwaway because I know some of the people involved use Reddit. This is a very weird story and I'm sorry for that, but I'm going to try and elaborate as best as I can. I just want this to be over. 

My boyfriend was shot and killed a week ago. We had been together for 3 years. I will absolutely admit that our relationship was not perfect. About a year in, he began to severely emotionally and mentally abuse me. He had a mental illness and would not treat it. I do not know why I stayed with him. Nevertheless, his loss hit me very hard. It was sudden and tragic and, being close to his family, I wanted to be there for them. 

I few days ago, I was contacted by three different girls who claim to have slept with my boyfriend while we were together. They all claimed to not know I ever existed. They provided photo evidence. I always knew he was cheating on me in the back of my mind, but the revelation of these facts after his passing has been devastating for me. I thanked all the girls for their honesty and then blocked them on social media. I didn't want to see them anymore, nor did I think they needed to see him. I want to put this entire chapter of my life behind myself. Only one of the girls, ""R"", acted kind of hostile toward me. I messaged back to her nothing but ""fuck off"" and blocked her. That was it. 

I then started receiving harassing, cruel messages from fake Twitter accounts. The messages claimed my boyfriend and I were NEVER together and that I'm merely seeking attention (I was in his sister's wedding... I was in his obituary... All of his friends know me... He simply lied to these girls in particular). They attacked me personally, including my line of work and the school I agree. The wording and insults were almost exactly like the ones R had thrown at me. I did not respond, blocked all the accounts, and set my Twitter to private. I then messaged one of my boyfriend's friends, ""H"", who knows her slightly, and asked that he please tell her to stop. I just want to be left alone. I unplugged from all social media. 

The messages stopped. But now H has contacted me saying that R's mother has been speaking to her (???) and that R is being threatened and harassed online. R is accusing me of doing this, but I haven't had any words with her since I blocked her actual account. R showed her mother the ""fuck off"" message and said that I'm a danger to her daughter. R's father evidently works in the police department and says he will track my IP address and prove the messages are from me (they absolutely are not) and will have me arrested. R told H that even without proof, I will be at least reprimanded because her dad can ""pull strings"" (????)

I just want to grieve in peace. I don't understand why this needs to continue and I never ever tried to initiate any kind of conflict. I want to move on with my life and from this terrible relationship I was in. Now I'm nervous about police showing up at my door. How can I mediate this situation?? I've tried ignoring it, but it does nothing to stop it. 

Edit: I'm so sorry. I forgot to mention that his family found out about the infidelity and kindly ask that she not attend the viewing. She did so anyway, high, and with a group of friends. They laughed at his casket and were asked to leave. The harassment began after this. 

**TL;DR: My late boyfriend cheated on me. The other girl is now threatening me with police action for 'threatening messages' that were absolutely not sent by me. How to proceed?**

His ex wife is with another man and does not see the kids much if at all. So he raises them. I babysit his son when he takes his daughter to her girls only meeting. Don't get me wrong, Mia loves her little brother. She at 4 has taken on a big sister type role. Apart from their dropkick mother they are a wonderful family. 

Mia does go to her girls only class, it's like girl scouts I think. So I look after his son while he takes her to that. My friend and roommate keep buying him toys because she thinks a 2 year old will put a good word in for her. How do I tell her this is foolish? She's admitted this was her plan

I have difficulties opening up and don't really have anyone I can turn to for advice, so I'm hoping that this is the right place.

My father &amp; only family died suddenly in 2011 when I was doing my last year in high school. The death caused me to lose my scholarships and friends, I have been on my own since then working like crazy to pay bills and get myself through college, having no time to make friends or even being relatively comfortable to open up to anyone.

I have been working with the same company for the past 4 years, switching multiple positions and departments just to chase that higher dollar. During these switches I have bumped into a coworker who looks and acts exactly like of my late father. Let's call him Peter.

Peter is a lovely older man, he is the maintenance and landscaper guy of the company. Peter is such a gentle soul and extremely hard working just like my dad, he walks and talks and laughs exactly like my father, he even looks like him in height and face, it's driving me crazy, making me believe that he's come back to life when I know that this is a totally different person! He is so much like my father that I can't even act normally anymore, I have suppressed the feelings so much over the years that I just don't know how to behave. 

*A few weeks ago after work, my old car was having troubles and I had to pull over on the main highway in our city. Peter saw me and pulled over, he helped bring my car back to life just enough to drive it to a shop. When I got to the shop with Peter following, he offered to help me find a better car that wasn't so old, even let me borrow his second car that his son doesn't use anymore... His kind words and helpfulness made me start to bawl right in front of him at the shop, things became awkward &amp; he thought I was crying because of my car issues. But in reality I was crying because I really wish that my dad was here instead &amp; that he could be here himself to help me out, made me think how much different the world would be if he was still alive.

Fast forward to now, I have been awkward/embarrassed and avoiding Peter whenever he tries to check up on me with my car issues or even bumping into him in the building. I know that he knows that I'm avoiding him, I don't mean to be rude but I just don't know what to do/say after such a unexpected meltdown, I just want to cry alone in my office. I am now realizing that I may need to talk to a therapist due to all these closed up emotions, but I just need to know what I can do now to not be awkward &amp; not bawl my eyes out at work.
  ---   
 TL;DR: Working with a coworker who is a copy/paste of my late father, I thought I was over his death but clearly I am not. I don't know how to handle my feelings or future encounters with this coworker without bawling my eyes out.

"[Non-romantic] [Personal Issues] I (15 F) can't get my homework done quick enough, neat enough, and with enough quality to please my parents (middle aged, F and M). It is tearing them apart and I'm not sure who the problem is.


My school has block scheduling. We have 2 days, and half of our classes on each day. Hence, homework assigned Monday is due Wednesday.

Today, I had some leftover homework assigned yesterday to finish for tomorrow. I did it, and it took me a few hours. Then, I took an hour's break. My mom came into my room and screamed at me for 48:56 (taped it, if you're wondering why it's so specific.) minutes. She screamed about how I have no extra skills in life besides school (so I don't know things about cars, computers etc. like my much more knowledgeable brother does), that I don't have any skills besides academics (or else she wouldn't care so much about it) and that it's not like I can act or be a model. 

She also yelled about how my work was crappy and how my teachers find errors when they grade my papers because I don't read the over. This was when she finally got around to addressing the paper I was actually doing today, which was a bunch of questions about a document that everyone else always hand writes. They answer in a page, maybe front and back, and I do it in 5 typed pages. Still, my work is not that great, and I need to do better or else I will end up a leech upon someone in the world according to my mom. Also, my work takes too long and I need to go faster, I lie all the time, and the only thing I'm interested in is watching TV. It apparently started so that I could fit in social but now I'm addicted to it and I always run to it and I act like she's the one making me study when I picked my classes. She wants me to drop all my classes from AP to CP (2 levels down from AP) at my school so that I can handle it.

There was more of that and then she takes my phone and computer and makes me sit in her room while she sleeps with the light on to monitor me. She said she wont be able to go to work or do well there tomorrow because I was keeping her up since I wouldn't do work unless monitored. So I moved to the work that was due Thursday. Then, she tells me that from now on until I go to college I must surrender my phone and computer and do work in the kitchen so that I am monitored in a public space. I can only go to my room when done and never have anymore TV or fun time with my tech. She will tell me to study for my SAT subject tests from now on after homework. This is until I graduate college.

To be fair to her, I do take a while to do homework, I did spend 2 hours of free time instead of homework, and couldn't account for those hours and I do need to eventually have time after hmwk to study for subject tests, even though they are in May and I have a while to study. 

To be fair to me, My GPA is 99.16 and my QPA is well over a 100 once my APs at factored in. Also, all the homework due the next day was done by 9. I really need some relaxation time or I'm going to be stressed. I'm also too addicted to reddit and TV not to have 1-2 hours of it a day. I don't know how to do better, or if I'm the problem or my parents are. Help.

Tldr; my parents took away TV and fun time until I go to college because I didn't do my homework as fast as they wanted. How can I go faster without loosing some free time or am I not the problem?"

"I (M28) asked for a raise at my company before the holidays and received a much larger one than expected. Now interactions with my bosses and higher level employees (M&amp;F 40+) are very awkward.


I have been at my company for 4 1/2 years now (in a professional construction-based field). I enjoy the work, but at times it can get very boring. For the past 2+ years I have really been busting my ass and working hard and long hours (~10hr days, more than 90% of my company) mainly because I am a perfectionist and everything has to be done exactly right. However, before that, for about 8 months, I was in a huge slump and not very productive. This was because I felt slighted for several projects I had been passed over to work on, and had been basically farmed out to other areas of my company to jump around to help them complete these irrational deadlines each week. This lack of productivity (which I personally acknowledged) was brought to my attention by my boss, and I shaped up. Like I said, now (for the past 2+ years) I really get stuff done and am on top of my game.

Before the holidays I requested a meeting with our HR director to discuss a possible raise because I have been getting lots of offers from other companies, as well as getting hints from my colleagues that I am probably underpaid for the vast amount of work that I am in charge of now. The HR director suggested that I come talk to her about this after a few of us politely aired grievances as the stragglers sitting around at the end of our company Christmas party. She suggested that I ""sell myself"" if I wanted any kind of change (which is never something I would normally do - I would rather be rewarded for hard work as an acknowledgement, rather than have to ask for it), but that is what I did, layed it all out in black and white, as well as followed up with an email highlighting all the points I discussed with her.

About a week ago, I was pulled into an office and informed by the HR director as well as the CEO of the company that I received a very large raise based on my talk with her and follow up email, etc. The principals (owners) of the company are the ones that determine compensation for employees, however they do not really interact with any of the employees like my actual boss etc. does with me. I am obviously incredibly excited for this to happen, but ever since it has, my relationship with my boss as well as other higher-ranking employees (all who would know about it) has been very awkward. I cant help but get the feeling that they think I should not have gotten such a sizable increase, and that they all associate me with the slump I was in almost 3 years ago. I just get the vibe that everyone is judging and knows that I asked for a raise, which is something I would normally never do. I just had a meeting with my boss about the raise I received and he could not even look me in the eye while talking about it, which made me insanely uncomfortable almost like he thought it was unmerited. Am I reading into this too much and just paranoid? Or how can I make this feel less awkward? Because I was encouraged to discuss and ask for more compensation, I feel like I am having to prove myself once again, rather than already proving my worth and being rewarded for it. 

**TL:DR - I was advised to ask for a raise at my company if I wanted it, and I received a much larger one than expected. Now my work relationship with my bosses seems awkward knowing that they know I asked for more money (and received a lot) almost getting the sense that they may think it is unmerited. I may be overthinking.**"
"Me [20 F] with my brother [30 M] and his wife [34 F], they wrote a list of everything they dislike about me


[removed]"
"MY [34M] son [5M] is really possessive of my GF [32F] and I feel bad, but also concerned, and I can't tell if I'm reading to much into it.


My wife died about two weeks after giving birth due to some unfortunate complications. It's been very hard, but my son (I'll call him Tommy) and I are very close and we've found a way to be happy together. I haven't dated much, just had a few casual relationships and flings. None of those women ever spent time with Tommy, except maybe a trip to get pizza or a day at the park. They were introduced only as friends to him.

Anyway, last spring I met a woman (I'll call her Erica) and I have fallen I love with her. She's kind, loving and supportive-- and she has fully accepted and loved Tommy (which was one of the most important things I was looking for in a spouse). she's the perfect addition to our family. 

Tommy and Erica have absolutely hit it off. They're close and affectionate towards one another, they spend lots of on one all the time together. And I can tell Tommy loves the 'maternal attention' Erica has given him. However, recently Tommy has become sort of cranky about me being around as well. I'm hurt because I love my son, and I hate to think he doesn't want me around... but I can't figure out what the root of all of this is...

 I mentioned I was coming with them to go get ice cream and he got mad and demanded I stay home. When he and Erica are chilling on the couch he makes me sit on a different couch (however I never give in).  He's more than happy when it's just us, so I do t think he actually doesn't like having me around. 

I don't really buy into the whole Oedipal complex, so I don't think it's that. Especially seeing as he knows Erica is not his mom. I just can't for the life of me understand why he would treat me like this. Erica doesn't think it's a problem, and my mother thinks that it's him just basking in having 'mommy time' for the first time in his life.  Is this what it is? Is it just that simple? 

Erica and I have been open and honest-- within the next couple of years we want more kids, marriage and a home together, even though we haven't been together all that long (which is why we are giving it a bit more time, even though I'd do it now if we could). I'm not worried about him getting to attached only for Erica and I to break up.  I just don't think I can live my life as the third wheel to Erica and Tommy, but perhaps that's just me overthinking and being dramatic. 

Another note-- I think a lot about my wife  and her family and how they feel about Erica and Tommy, her dad and I are still close and he's met Erica a few times, he likes her, but I can tell he's concerned about Erica replacing her. Which I think is a whole other can of worms, so I'll digress. 

Can you help me straighten my head out?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm a single dad that has raised my son alone pretty much since his birth.  Now,my son is very attached to my girlfriend, so much so that he acts like he doesn't want me around. He seems to want her all to himself.

Sorry about all the text. "

"My [24m] brother [29m] has decided his kids [7f, 5m &amp; 4f] need to call me sir when speaking to me (and sir/ma'am to everyone else). I know they're his kids but it weirds me out.


I'm not really sure what I can even do in this situation. I've already told my brother it creeps me out but he's been on some weird pretentious kick since him and his wife divorced. He thinks his kids need to learn to respect him more. 


If they forget, which kids do, he seems like he's too hard on them. They get punished even if they apologize and correct themselves because he thinks it's been too long for them to not be in the habit now. Often ending outings and taking them home because they ""can't behave themselves in public"" or sending them to time out while the rest of us continue without them. Other kids don't call every adult sir/ma'am with every breath and their mother doesn't require it so it's pretty confusing for them to suddenly be treated like brats over it. 


He also tells me I can't take them places if I won't enforce his rules. I don't stop them from calling me it because it's already confusing enough for them to switch back between mom and dad but I'm not going to discipline them over it if they forget. It's really fucking embarrassing to be around him in public when he's chewing a kid out for disrespecting him. He sounds like an abusive, insecure, controlling dickhead. 


Our parents hardline told him they're ""grandma and grandpa"" not ""Sir and Ma'am"" and now they're not allowed unsupervised visits. I love my nieces and nephew and having them constantly ""sir""ing me is awkward and makes me feel slimy. Is there anything I can say to make my brother see reason?


**tl;dr:** After his divorce my brother has insisted his kids call adults ""Sir and Ma'am"" every time they speak and punishes them if they forget. It's uncomfortable and causing family tension. Is there anything I can do?"
"I [39f] get upset when my husband [35m] won't let me leave the room or restrains me during an argument. Is this abuse?


This is a lot of information. DH didn’t grow up in the best home life. I don’t know. I want to give him space to get past this, but it seems to be escalating. Here’s a very lengthy description of what is going on. We recently moved and I don’t have anybody local. Can the Reddit community help me see some clarity here?

During previous fights dh has restrained me to keep me from leaving the room to cool off. This would only make me angrier and make me feel vulnerable. I have no ability to overcome him, he is half a foot taller and weighs twice as much as I do. There are also times when he won’t let me out of a hug if I’m angry. And once he wouldn’t let me up off the bed because I was sad and emotional and wanted to gather my thoughts and feelings before talking to him. I have a history of needing time to process and get my thoughts together before having a confrontational conversation. He gets upset with this and wants to deal with things right then and there. Sometimes with children in the room/next room. Blended family, only the baby (15 months) is shared. Other kids are 5 (mine) 7 (his) 13 (mine) 16 (mine). He is 35. I’m 39. We have been together 2 years.

On Saturday January 7th dh and I got in a verbal argument. The three youngest children were nearby and I didn’t want it to escalate and things be said in front of them. I tried to leave the room. dh blocked me. As I tried to leave he would physically push me back using his body, not his hands. After he cooled off and apologized I told him that he had to stop physically detaining me. I told him it really upsets me.

January 16 2017

At 6pm I took my 5 year old upstairs for a bath and I took a shower after she was done. The baby was on the main floor. I was playing with her before I went upstairs. She did not seem cranky or tired, she seemed to be having fun playing and trying to communicate with me. I have previously asked dh to not let the baby go to sleep between dinner and bedtime as it makes it very difficult to get her to bed.

Texts:

Me: 6:53 - Baby Awake?

dh: 6:53 - Nope

Me: 6:54 - Fun night ahead

dh 7:15 - Don’t worry I’ll stay up with her.

dh woke the baby to come up for ice cream at 8:21. The baby was very cranky and took about 10 minutes to calm down.

I watched tv, ate ice cream, nursed the baby, then played with the baby on the floor until it was time for me to head to bed at 10. dh took the baby down in his basement office, his usual place to try and get her to sleep (he plays video games and watches Netflix with the baby on his lap).

I got ready for bed in our second floor bathroom. I could hear the baby screaming from the basement. It is unusual for her to cry loud enough to hear on the second floor when she is in dh’s office. She didn’t calm down after 10 minutes

Texts

Me: 10:12 - She’s so sad :(

Me: 10:16 - Just bring her

dh: 10:24 - [she] was sad because I put her butt on the floor

Me: 10:24 - Why are you so mean?

At this time dh brought the baby to me and went back to his office. For the next 20 minutes the baby wouldn’t settle down in the dark bedroom. She rolled around, reached for toys from her co-sleeper crib, nursed off and on, and smacked my face to try and get me to play with her. I was angry and sent this text:

Me: 10:45 - This is real fucing nice. Guess I will start showering in the morning. Because fuck playing with her so she doesn’t go to sleep between dinner and bed. Way easier to just let her sleep.

dh then comes up to take the baby. However, I didn’t want him to take her back downstairs to let her cry herself to exhaustion as he had done earlier in the night. So I told him that I would keep her and please go away.

At this time dh tried to take her out of my arms. I asked him again to go away, that she would stay with me. At this time dh painfully grabbed my wrist to limit my movement. At this time the baby was wailing. I told dh “Let me go right now or I will leave you.” dh said “Go ahead, leave.” He held on for another 10 seconds or so and let both me and the baby go. I took time to comfort the baby and let her nurse to calm her down.

dh was immediately regretful and his demeanor changed. He again asked to take the baby downstairs. I refused. He sat on the side of the bed and played with the baby for about 10 minutes. I mentioned that I was upset because my arm still hurt from where he squeezed it. dh went downstairs and turned off his game and then went to bed. He apologized twice, but I did not respond. The baby struggled to fall asleep, she finally went to sleep around 12:00

The next day (11:30 am) there is faint bruising and pain in the area where I was held.

**TL;DR! I am tired of not being able to leave the room during an argument or being physically restrained. Last night it escalated to him forcibly holding my wrist in anger. When is enough? Do I help him through this? Do I leave?**

"My [33F] husband [36M] is discouraging me from losing weight


I am coming up against a ton of opposition from my husband regarding wanting to lose weight. I'm 33, 5'3 and 160 pounds, so I'm pretty overweight for my height. When I met my husband, I was 135 pounds and that's right around what I'd like to weigh again, give or take a couple pounds. I don't think it's unreasonable - it's a healthy weight range.
  
My husband, however, is being really difficult about it. He doesn't tell me outright not to lose the weight, but refuses to be encouraging or supportive. He has gone so far as to accuse me of not caring what he wants and that he thinks I look good fat, basically. We have had full-on fights and he claims that he's just worried about my health and worried I will get an eating disorder (there is no reason to think that I would; I have lost weight before in a healthy way but gained it back due to babies). Then, he'll start going on about how he doesn't like 'rail thin' 'skinny women.' 135 at 5'3 is not 'skinny' or a 'rail' but he refuses to listen to reason.

He also does what I feel is intentionally sabotaging my efforts at eating healthier - buys a lot of sweets and baked goods and acts hurt if I don't eat it and claims he was just 'trying to be nice' if I point out that it's really unfair to bring in food that he knows I have a hard time resisting. He hates most sweet foods so it's not for him at all, either. He likes to make jokes about how he loves having a fat wife, too. 

I feel like this is becoming just as abusive, I guess, as a man trying to make his wife LOSE weight. I think that he's seriously overreacting but I have no idea how to get through to him at this point. There is a history of heart disease in my family and I am already at risk for diabetes. This isn't just a self-esteem issue for me, though it IS one of the factors. It's also health. It's also affecting our sex life because regardless of how HE feels, I loathe the way I look naked and my self-consciousness is affecting my sex drive. I have no idea how to get through to him, though. I've told him ALL of this. It's so disheartening and so much harder not to have encouragement.

Since it might come up: he is naturally very thin so he doesn't understand at all what it's like to struggle with weight or image issues after weight gain. 

edit: I know people rush to find 'feeders' but as I mentioned a few places below, we're open enough about kinks that I know that isn't on his 'list' and I am aware of one unconventional one so it's not like he's pretending to be vanilla. I do know obesity repulses him. He isn't trying to get me to gain MORE but sabotages if I alter my diet with the intent of maintaining my current weight. So, not really a fat fetishist or a feeder, but a chubby-chaser. He wants me to be exactly like this.

As an aside, I have in the past done paid work illustrating fetish material (for fetishes I don't have) so there is no reason for him to think I wouldn't be open minded about the concept (just not wanting to be obese myself, I don't care if you want to think about it and fap to it), or draw myself obese or what have you if that's what he wanted. I am myself very vanilla but I'm quite open minded and non-judgmental.

"[Dating] I [26F] hate texting people all day, every day. Is this a requirement in the dating world?


As the title says, I'm not a big fan of never-ending text conversations. I don't like having to be glued to my phone at all times. I prefer talking on the phone or meeting up in person - I just find it so much more enjoyable and it's so much easier to get into interesting conversations that way. For the record, I am definitely an introvert but not to an extreme. I like a balance of socializing and alone time. 

A few months ago, I made my first foray into online dating. It was a lot of fun! But it got exhausting after awhile, and my least favorite part of it was that once they got my number, pretty much every guy wanted to be texting from morning til night. I just dealt with it but usually only replied every 1-3 hours. 

See, I don't mind short text conversations if we actually have something interesting to talk about. But I find it fricken tedious having to answer ""how's your day"" 5000x a day. And having to wrack my brain to find topics to bring up to keep the conversation going. I would rather just go about my day in peace and save the chat for when we see each other.

Is there a non-awkward way to bring this up? It feels weird to bring up on its own early on out of the blue. Once someone has started texting me a lot, I feel like just stopping replying conveys a lack of interest but saying ""hey, btw, I don't like texting every day"" could be taken badly too. Does anyone have experience with this? If you're someone who enjoys constant texting, how would you feel if someone you were interested in said to you that they don't want to text all the time? 

And am I a rare breed? Am I going to seriously limit my prospects if I try to find someone that also doesn't want to be constantly texting?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I find constant small-talking over text exhausting and don't like being glued to my phone in general, but everyone I date seems to want to have never-ending text conversations. What's a good way to bring this up? Or is it something I should just deal with so I don't severely limit my prospects?"

"My BF (25M) thinks I'm gaslighting him, I (23F) think he's just forgetful


My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and overall have a good relationship. We have had our issues but overcome them.

One of the biggest issues we have is thoughtfulness. By nature, I am very aware, empathetic and thoughtful and remember small details about people. He, on the other hand, is forgetful and doesn't notice things around him much and is also more hyperactive and impulsive. He also has the textbook signs for ADHD (hyperactivity, lack of restraint, impulsivity), which he has agreed with me and acknowledged. He even set up an appointment with a psychiatrist to get tested, but had to cancel because he no longer has health insurance under his job. (He is still planning to go once he gets it again, until this conversation). 

Because of this, things will come up in day to day conversations where I say, remember we have X on this day. To which he replies ""you never told me that!"" After several minutes of me reminding him when/how I told him this, he will remember and go ""oh, yes, now I remember you telling me!""

Anyways, things like this happen often where I say something, he claims I never told him and accuses me of lying, and then he remembers. However, recently he has told me he thinks I am gas lighting him (???). We have had some issues recently, and I think he is shifting the blame to me to avoid taking ownership of his part. I personally think it is on both of us, me for my intermittent negative/ annoyed reactions and him for his ADHD/ forgetfulness. He is adamant that I am manipulating him into thinking he is forgetful despite the past evidence.

Am I actually gas lighting him without knowing? I honestly think I am coming from a genuine place in trying to encourage to get treated for his ADHD, but now he is spinning it back on me. Also, does this sound like ADHD or just a maturity issue? I am so confused. Any help is greatly appreciated.


Also to add- he has also struggled in school and college with attention issues. This is a huge reason why we both think it may be ADHD. In addition, his dad passed away when he was in middle school, which was the beginning of his emotional/ educational issues (he never went to counseling for this loss).



Tldr; boyfriend is forgetful and has agreed he may have ADHD. Now he is saying I'm manipulative and gas lighting him. Help?! "
