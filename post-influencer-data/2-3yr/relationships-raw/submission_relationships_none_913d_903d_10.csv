"[UPDATE] My ex-wife [36 F] still keeps trying to get back together with me [36 M] and our daughters [16 F] want that to happen too


[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i903h/my_exwife_36_f_still_keeps_trying_to_get_back/)

It's been a while since I was first here and I was reminded recently that I owed an update to the kind and good people here who helped me with our troubles.

A lot of things has happened. Among those things, my daughters actually stumbled across my post. I had no idea they even browsed Reddit, let alone this place. When I came home one day from work I found them crying. They pretty much jumped me, hugged me, wouldn't let me go and begged me to forgive them. Sadly, they had read one of my replies and found out the dreadful extent of my ex-wife's affair and how much it had devastated me.

It took us a while, but we got through it, as a family. There was nothing for me to forgive, they're still young and they love their mother, who took that love and used it to manipulate them. That's on her, not them. There was some much needed counseling, but after several months, the woman who was helping us heal and move on has said that nothing more needed to be done, and they should only check in with her once in a while, rather than continue their weekly sessions. 

We're closer than we were before, but their relationship with their mother has suffered for it. Which I think is completely understandable, but I still cautioned them about lingering too much on what she did, since I had gotten over what she did all those years ago. That was something also resolved in counseling (both their own and our shared ones), so it's all behind us now. 

I had a brief confrontation with my ex-wife about it and made it clear that she was to not talk about this getting back together nonsense any more with our daughters. I can't tell if it really got through to her, but my daughters have not been pestered about me since then. Or they simply ignore their mother and don't bring it up at home. Either way, so long as my daughters are doing fine, I could care less about what my ex-wife is doing. 

Since the situation had improved, things had also become much better between my daughters and my girlfriend, so much that they actually started talking with her (rather than just exchange terse greetings and goodbyes), even occasionally asking for tips on something (girly stuff, of course), and I can't tell you how much it warmed my heart to see it happening for the first time. 

I'll admit that also helped me push my thoughts in the direction of proposing to my girlfriend, who had been incredibly supporting and understanding through all of this. We had known each other for a long time now, spent so much time as a couple, and after all this mess, I didn't really think there was anything more I could to to express my love for her. However, I was beaten to the punch. 

Two months ago, Clemence, together with my daughters, surprised me one day and proposed to me. I have to say that I felt very odd, but also very happy. Not just the proposal, but that my daughters had actually worked with my girlfriend on surprising me that day with dinner and a night out. To put it simply, I was blown away. It was a small and private ceremony, with only our closest friends and family attending. Currently, we're also expecting, and my daughters are looking forward to having a baby brother or sister to spoil.

  ---   
  **tl;dr: My daughters had found my previous post and saw in one of the replies how deeply I was hurt by their mother's cheating. Asked for forgiveness, there was no need for it. We worked through our issues together, both at home and in some counseling, and we healed from it and got much better. Even their relationship with my girlfriend had improved, so much that one day they helped her arrange a nice night for us, where she proposed to me. We're married and currently expecting, with my daughters eagerly looking forward to having a younger sibling to spoil rotten.**"
"UPDATE: Dad [48 M] is really into Pokemon Go and I [18 F] am not sure if its getting out of hand or not.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ylr0k/dad_48_m_is_really_into_pokemon_go_and_i_18_f_am/

Hey Guys! It's been a while, but I remembered this post by chance yesterday and decided to follow up.

A lot of people in the original post said that he would likely lose interest within the next couple months. Well, here we are 7 months later, and he's still playing. The thing is, he got my mom to start playing with him! I pretty much never play now, but they have a great time playing together. My mother started in December, but she's already passed me in level and I think she has more Pokemon registered in her pokedex than my dad. I also haven't heard her complain about her foot pain in a while, so I don't think that should be an issue now. He has also stopped asking me so many questions and wanting that to be our only conversation topic, but that's probably also because he is now as experienced in the game as I am, if not more.

Over the weekend, we all went out for dinner, and were walking around the outside mall while waiting for our table to be ready. My mom whispered a little ""Omg!"" and showed us that there was a Tyranitar right across the street. For those who don't know, it's an extremely rare pokemon, and I think the most powerful one in the game right now, barring a legendary. We were all able to catch it :)
That's really all there is to say, and I think I was just worried that it would devolve into something addictive and unhealthy. But I see now that it's a fun little activity for the both of them, and I am glad we are all able to bond through it.

tl;dr: Dad still plays PoGo, got my Mom to play too. Now they're having fun together and working to catch 'em all."

"[Update] Me [24F] with my BF [24M] of 5 months. I need to break up with him but need advice.


[Original] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5wxvmj/me_24f_with_my_bf_24m_of_5_months_i_need_to_break/)

I just wanted to post a quick update to whoever commented/messaged me about my last post here. So I can happily say that I broke up with him that night. He knew something was up and I had a really hard time putting all the words out there but I told him we were done, and of course he tried to guilt me into staying with him. He kept going on about how much he put into our relationship and how he never treated me bad, but I stayed strong and told him we were no longer in a relationship. I even told him he could stay until he found another place. 

And then about 2 weeks later things got a little messy. He told me he found a place and was going to be out by that Saturday. Then I came home that Friday and was upstairs in my room. He came into my room and started asking me random questions about my ex - what's his name, is his name so and so. I told him it was none of his business, and then realize that while I changed my passwords and locks on my iPhone/laptop, I never changed my password on my iPad.. He went through my Facebook on my iPad while I was at work (even though we had been broken up for 2 weeks at that point) and saw messages from another guy that I was talking to.  I never even gave him the code to my iPad and had no idea he knew the code (it was different than all my other ones and I rarely use it). 

He goes and grabs my iPad and tries to show me and asks who is so and so? And I take my iPad from him and told him it was none of his business, we were broken up. I wasn't even talking to my ex, I confided in an old FWB and we started flirting pretty hardcore, but I hadn't even done anything physical with him at that point. He just assumed it was my ex for whatever reason. Then he starts telling me I'm a ho and a slut, and I started to feel suffocated because I've been in shitty abusive relationships before. So then I packed all of my electronics and left. 

About 5 minutes later I realized that he just berated me and called me abusive names in my own house, and I got realllllly pissed. I went back home and told him to get the fuck out, I was being nice by letting him stay until he could find a place and then he has to go snooping through all my things. He kept begging and asking if he could stay, that I'm not a ho, that I'm really smart and that he knows guys want me etc. Basically all B.S. like before so he could stay longer. I stayed firm and told him I didn't care, he doesn't get to call me names in my own house, and he needs to pack his stuff and leave NOW. He packed and left a few hours later. I don't know and don't care where he went, but I am so happy he is no longer in my life. I blocked his number and blocked him on all social media.

I've started eating better again and have been going to the gym 5x a week for the past few weeks, and am feeling sooo much better. I've lost about 5 pounds since he's been gone. I was really in quite a slump there for a while and put on quite a bit of weight, so I'm taking care of myself for now.

Thank you everyone that bothered to read/reply to my first point, you guys helped me make the right choice and gave me the push I need, I love you all. 

  **tl;dr**: I broke up with scumbag ex thanks to Reddits help. "

I (accidentally) got pregnant last year with my boyfriend of 6 years, and although it was definitely a surprise we were both pretty happy about it. I'm extremely close with my sister and told her and my mother straight away, and they were both extremely excited for me. When I was 12 weeks along my sister came to me and told me she was pregnant too with her husband, around 5 weeks at that time. Obviously this was extremely exciting, we've done everything together our whole lives and this was just beyond perfect timing! We started making birth plans, and what nursery designs we wanted, and it was generally just so lovely to be expecting at the same time.

Unfortunately, when I was 16 weeks, I started bleeding very heavily with a lot of pain, and ended up miscarrying. It was awful, an extremely traumatic time for me and I did struggle with the loss for quite a while. My boyfriend and my family were extremely supportive and loving, and I got into grief counselling within a month. It was tough, but I did honestly feel a good bit better until my niece was born.

My sister gave birth in March and it's absolutely destroyed me. I had struggled a little bit seeing my sister's belly during her last few months of pregnancy as we're identical and I couldn't help but think ""that should be what I look like"", however, it doesn't even come close to how I felt seeing her with my niece for the first time. I don't even know how to begin to explain how I feel. Just pure jealousy, even a bit of hatred towards her. I know it's not her fault that I miscarried but when I see how beautiful my niece is my rational thinking goes out the window and it just bubbles up inside me. I've managed to hold it in around her for the last few visits but I'm honestly frightened that I'm going to snap and scream at her. I've only held her daughter twice since she was born and I think she's starting to notice that I'm not comfortable around her since she's given birth.

Can anybody please give me advice on how to handle this? I really love my sister, and I know that she needs my support right now. My niece is a fussy baby, and she's struggling, and I really want to be there for her but I honestly just don't think I can handle it. I've booked a session with my therapist but I have to wait for my appointment. Has anyone ever dealt with these kinds of feelings before? How did you get past them? Please help me before I damage my relationship with my sister.

TL;DR: Had a miscarriage last year, now struggling to be around my twin sister and her newborn child with feelings of jealousy and loss. Need help moving past these feelings."

"I [35F] have been dating my best friend [35F]'s best guy friend [35M] and she is livid.


My friend and I have been friends for a long time, did all of the fun mommy stuff together.  We were like sisters.  I got divorced and started dating her husband's best friend, her ""2nd husband"" of sorts.  She was livid and ended our friendship.  She listed other reasons for ending it, but I really knew it was because of this guy.  I was really upset, going through a nightmare divorce, but dealt with it and moved on.  I decided she wasn't that good of a friend anyway to desert me when I needed friends the most.

He and I stopped seeing each other at that time, but started up again last Fall and have been having a great time together ever since.  

My old BFF reached out recently, and I reciprocated.  We started with a playdate, which went really well, and we decided to go out to dinner just the two of us.  I told the guy (I don't consider him a BF) who is still good friends with her and her husband that he needs to tell her about us before I go to this dinner.  Well, she is livid again.  She can't use any of the reasons she used last year to end our friendship, so now I know it is simply because of him, and I am baffled.  This is her husband's best friend, she has been married for 12 years, I can't understand the jealousy and need to be territorial.  

Can anyone shed some light on this for me??

"Friend [24F] wants us [22-25Fs] to call her ""mom.""


There's a girl in our friend group who's pretty fun and quirky but lately she's been going around asking us all to call her mom, or that saying she's ""the mom friend."" Some people have gotten into it because she is a very nice and caring person, but it's also really awkward sometimes. Especially when she does it in front of strangers or in public.

I don't mind if I'm allowed to ignore it and just call her by her name but the constant insistence has become uncomfortable. When I explained to her that I can't/won't do it because I don't see her that way and I'm just not into it, she became very upset and not only implied I was jealous but also that people really do see her like a mom. The latter would be fine if it weren't for the way she explained it, which came across as very pretentious.

She's a likable person, but lately with this thing it's become a major divide in our friend group of around seven to ten people. The handful of us who aren't down are being left out and it's become more difficult to partake in plans because ""mom"" is ""taking the kids out to play."" There are some other behaviors pertaining to her mental health that have made addressing things even more difficult.

I guess I'm fine with just opting out of the group entirely, I have other friends, but I'm not sure how to deal with it? What is with this and is there a way to explain that I'm not interested in calling her ""mom"" or letting her treat me like a child without angering her or alienating my friends who do enjoy it?

UPDATE: I was invited to hang out with the group tonight but politely declined after checking the aforementioned friend's social media. She even has things like ""Mom friend"" plastered all over her profiles which is a little too weird for me right now considering. Going to cuddle up with my boyfriend and watch Archer instead and think a little more on how I want to handle this going forward. Thank you so much for the support! I really appreciate the suggestions and am always happy to hear more!

"Me (35m) with my wife (31f). After years of her seeming uninterested until she was ""in the mood"", my brain has finally got the memo and I don't feel sexually attracted to her. I'm freaking out.


I guess our sex life was centered around her libido, and if I were to initiate when she wasn't feeling""in the mood"" she would just turn away and mostly ignore me until I gave up. That seemed to me like she didn't want me, and after years of this, it feels like I started to put up guards against rejection. Over the last year I gradually stopped looking at her in a sexual way, and now it's constant.

I mean, our sex life is great, but in the days between having sex I can't approach her sexually or she'll act annoyed or something. Now she's initiating and I just don't feel anything.

I've talked to her about it but she doesn't know what to do or how to change. We live in a very rural area and have no one to talk to about it, and have no counseling available in the area and are stuck here for months.

I just don't know. When we have sex, everything is back to normal and we seem fine - playful and happy, until she kinda turns cold or disinterested, and then my sex drive turns off and I feel nothing when I look at her. It's lasting days and even weeks. I have no desire for sex with her. It feels like I'm protecting myself from rejection.

What do we do? Is this normal? I ache to be with her, but I can't feel anything sexual towards her when I look at her. She can get all handsy but I still won't feel anything. It's like I want to have sex, but can't bring myself to think of her like that because of all the rejection.

TL;DR : I don't feel anything sexual towards my wife even though she's really hot."

"My aunt [50sF] belittled me [22F] after my brother [30M] physically assaulted me. How do I make my family stop pressuring me to forgive her?


In April 2014 my (half) brother physically assaulted me in our home during an argument. After the first time he hit me I messaged my dad and told him that ""Chris"" had hit me, he was angry and to call the police because he had threatened to kill me. After I messaged Chris tried to come back into my room and I slammed the door in his face. He pushed back in and attacked me further, which resulted in bruises on my neck where he tried to choke me, and a cut above my ear which was bleeding. He is physically bigger and stronger than me. My mum witnessed the second part of the attack and, as a shit parent would do, took my brothers side in everything. 

When the police arrived to take a statement, they took photos of my injuries, asked if I wanted to press charges (which I decided not to) my mum refused to make a statement of her own and just said ""what she said happened"" when they asked her. They didn't arrest him because he'd already left. Not long after we received letters saying Chris had a court ordered avo, and that if anything further happened he would be arrested. 

A few days after that I received a message from my aunt, letting me know that ""family are meant to stick together"" and ""now your brother is going to court because of you"" and how I need to ""act before thinking"" I replied with ""sorry, I won't tell anyone the next time I'm abused and someone threatens to kill me, silly me for thinking I should be safe"" it turned into me defending myself, and her telling me I shouldn't have gotten an avo because it would ""limit his future opportunities"" I had to remind her that it was a court ordered avo that was done by the police because of my injuries. She said a lot of extremely rude and hurtful things, all while I tried to defend myself.

She proceeded to block me on Facebook, I gave up any contact with her. About a year later she unblocked me, and sent me a message saying ""I apologise for calling you a shitty person"" I didn't reply. About two weeks after she sent another message  ""and I apologise for being a shitty aunty""

Now my mum and nana are both pressuring me to talk to her again, and to forgive her. I don't want to. She never apologised for the things she said to me, for telling me I deserved to be abused, for telling me having the police called was an immature decision. I accepted the loss of someone who clearly didn't care about me, she doesn't bring any value to my life, I still speak to my uncle and cousins, so it's not like I'm cutting off any extra family by not speaking to her. 


tl;dr - my aunt told me I deserved it, among other horrible things, after I was assaulted. I cut off contact with her. My mum and nana are now pressuring me to talk to her because ""it's been long enough"" how do I get them to stop?

Edit - man I wish I'd used my throwaway for this. I can't thank you guys enough for everything you're saying. I feel like I'm going slightly less crazy knowing that I'm not a horrible person for not wanting to speak to her"
"A guy[24M] I[20m] go to university with came to me with some information regarding my father[43M] and I am seriously confused as to what to do next


A few days ago I received a fb message from a guy that I've seen before on University since we both go to the same one. We hung out before but it was in a larger group and never just the two of us so I found this a bit strange but he told me that he'd like to talk with me about something, in private and not online. That was even weirder but I said okay, let's see what the fuss is about. 

And boy oh boy, did he had something to tell. Essentially and very shockingly, it turns out he might be my half-brother. We met and went to grab a coffee and he showed me an old picture of what he said was his dad whom he never met. His mom told him that his father left the country shortly before he was born and that's it. He only had this picture of him, his entire life. Up until a few weeks ago when he found my fb profile and saw pictures of my dad on it. 

And yep, it's the same guy. I can definitely confirm that the picture he showed me is my father but he was young, maybe like 17 or 18. I do know for a fact that between the ages of 18 and 20, my father and his family lived for a short while in a foreign country before coming back and going by this, I can see similarities in what Tom(fake name) said about his dad. 

Now, this whole thing took me by surprise and I am still quite shocked to know this. Honestly, never before I spotted any similarity between Tom and my dad but dear God now that I look at Tom, he is a carbon copy of my father. Facial structure, nose, eyes, everything. But this isn't why I am here. I am here because I don't even know how to bring this up with my dad, or should I ever bring it up. I mean, I should probably talk with him about this but I don't how to, especially after recent events. 

My dad has been depressed for awhile and it really was hard for our family during this time and only recently he started coming back to us. I fear that if this turns out to be true, it will throw him back in the same spot again. How can I best approach this situation?

tl;dr A guy I go to University with might be my half-brother. He showed me a photo of his dad that he carries with him all the time and I can confirm it is, in fact, my father. I don't know how to talk to my dad who has suffered from depression for awhile and only recently showed signs of improvement. "
"My (34f) ex-husband (49m) cheated on me and had a child with a younger woman (mid-late 20s). We are divorced and I've heard she has minimal contact with him. Is it appropriate to get in touch with her to be friends and support each other. I feel a sense of kinship with her and our kids are siblings.


Question is pretty much in the Title, but a little more relevant background is in order. My ex is a pretty rotten person, he went after me when I was 21 and he was 38. I thought I was too smart to listen to all my family and friends warnings (to girls in their teens and 20s being wooed by an older guy...LISTEN TO YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS). 12 years later I I've let my career go to waste, I was totally dependent on him, thank god for generous court system because he would have left me and my kids with zero if it were his choice. At least now I have some breathing room.

About 18 months ago I found out about his other child. I was 70% sure something was up but was validated after a long sting of events that caught him red handed at work having the affair. 

Fast forward to this weekend and I saw the girl and baby at a hotel. It was like looking into a mirror 10 years ago. I felt awful for her. I've heard through the grapevine that he's more or less abandoned her too and she's fighting for support now. 

Is it appropriate to reach out to her and try to be friendly and support her in whatever way I can? I feel a kinship with her and as of yet, my kids have not met thier sibling. Is this too odd basically?

I'm not saying I'm my little brother's father-figure or anything, but I do try to look out for him/advise him/help him, with things our dad might've done.


We're close. We get on well. We're different in alot of ways but we don't clash at all. We're something of a double-act really. We bounce off each other quite well. We're not like most brother-brother relationships I know of.


Being the older brother I, naturally, have went through things, done the trial and error (sweet lord Jesus in heaven the innumerable errors), and had time to reflect on them before he did. Shaving, taking care of his skin and his hygiene, social worries, future fears, etc... the basic teenage-boy shit, I've tried to help him with. I've tried to guide him, advise him, and help him, while holding in mind that he ain't me and some of his shit he has to work out himself. I accept that, at 18, I'm not really a fountain of knowledge - more of an empty cup really, but I try.


When it comes to sex I, like most of the internet, am obviously a handsome, muscular, experienced stud rocking a ten-incher. Or maybe I'm a fairly normal, fairly horny kid who maybe started too young. You'll never know. But seriously, it isn't something I'm a complete idiot about (listen to me brag). Protection, consent, communication, etc... I'd say I've a fair understanding of most of these things, and could probably rely it to him through embarrassment.


Now I obviously know my little brother has an intrest in sex. Yeah, disgusting for me to know, but he does. There's reasons I'd never use his laptop. Cracking dirty jokes, getting wandering eyes on hot girls, obviously try to be noticed by the ladies, etc.. Totally unlike me, who was/is subtle and smooth at all times/s.


Recently, he's started going out with his first real girlfriend. I know, adorable. I have been enjoying playing the part of the brutally teasing older brother through this experience (as well as a part-time chauffer, learn to ride a bike you little shits). But seriously I'm proud of my bro and the girl seems nice. It's funny watching him so sweet on the girl and vice versa.


Call me insane, but I think sex is a possibility. Fourteen, I'd say is a fairly normal age. They like one another. Yeah, it's my little brother and that just makes it so odd to me, but looking at it objectively - it might happen.


I'm not sure if I should talk to him about sex (things like consent, protection, expectations, etc... I'm not about to give him a play-by-play) or if I should just give him a condom and a wink. It's one of those things our dad might've done, our mom sure as hell ain't doing it (nothing against our angel of a mother, she just won't), and it's something that probably would've helped me if I'd had it.


I'm leaning towards having it, as you can probably tell. But advice would be appreciated. Or do you think it would honestly be better to leave it unless he come to me directly? 


TLDR - Dead dad, mom won't do it, I think I should talk to my younger brother about sex. Unsure if I should, leaning towards yes. Advice appreciated."
"My [24 M] girlfriend [22 F] doesn't seem to get what I view as inappropriate encounters


So my girlfriend has always been kindof oblivious to guys' intentions in an almost comical sense. In the past she has accidentally gone out with what other guys thought were dates all of the time - movies, dinners, etc. thinking she was just going with a friend.

We recently had a long discussion about this after a newer guy friend of hers asked her to a concert together. I tried to outline that, while I trust her and everything, he would probably have viewed that as a date.

This led to me having to explain the social norms of what is an ""inappropriate"" type of encounter while in a relationship. Things like going to movies with random guys, grabbing 1-on-1 drinks late at night, going to concerts alone, going over to watch netflix alone, etc. Just in general, things I assumed most people just don't go out of their way to do when in relationships.

I thought she understood, but the other day she comes home at 1am and I found out she had just been over watching movies at this guys apartment all night who I had never met. I don't even know where to start.

Am I just being jealous and should trust her judgement more? Is there a better way for me to communicate that this makes me uncomfortable?

  tl;dr: My girlfriend puts herself in situations I would deem as questionable all the time, not sure how to handle it"
"Am I [32F] being taken too much for granted by my husband [38M] in our marriage? Doubting my self worth and esteem now.


Been with my husband for 10 years, of which married for 7. He's always been the star in the relationship, the life of our social circle, with a power career, an amazing son and all that. As more and more time passes, I feel like I am a supporting role in our life. 

Nothing outrightly cruel or mean, just a general sense of his decisions defining our lives and I am a people pleaser by nature. But now I feel the resentment building up. Have tried to talk to him a couple of times about how I feel, but he thinks I am being over dramatic. 

But something happened yesterday that makes me rethink everything. He got a local radio station that he works for to play a prank on me for April Fools, which was very humiliating (edit : have removed the details to make it less identifiable). 

 He tells me that's what a marriage is about - unconditional love and support, but I can't help but think if I am too much of a wimp in this relationship. What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this? 
TLDR ; Aprils fool prank by husband makes wife question how much of a wimp she is in the relationship, husband sees no issue with the whole situation. How much unconditional love and support is normal, and when does it become being taken granted for?

Edit : updated to clarify a couple of details.

Edit : Removed all the details of the prank to make this post unidentifiable. 

Edit : Thanks for all your support guys. And hugs back to those who gave me hugs. I really appreciate all you guys taking time out to reply to me. I told him the prank simply cannot air anymore. He promised he will take it off air by today, though I suspect that it would have ended normally since April Fools is over. But more importantly, I found the answer to my question - Am I a wimp in this relationship - yes. I need to sit with myself, sort out my feelings, understand what do I need for myself. I will explore therapy - Need to work on my passiveness, and also figure out if I want this marriage to work, and if yes, how to make it work. 
Once again, thank you everybody for your thoughts, they give me renewed belief in myself, and the confidence to actually do something about it.

Update : Day 2 after the prank aired. I am still trying to tell him just how bad I felt and why. He apologized a couple of times, and then snapped at me and told me, ""enough, we've fought about it yesterday. Just end it now and forget it. I don't want to talk about it anymore. "" I am realizing just how little my feelings matter. How was I so blind all this while!!"
"Me [38 M] with my wife [40 F] of 8 years. I think have fell out of love with her.


Hey Reddit, I have been lurking for a while, this is my first post here, I don't even know where to start as my feelings are still raw, i'm just looking for a outlet, somewhere I can write how I feel. Its a shame its about something miserable like this. I apologize now, this is going to be more like a book than a post. 

The reason for this post is I don't think I love my wife anymore. I'll refer to her as 'A' as I have no intention of her reading this is shes on here. 


Bit of background: We got married the summer of 2008, so we are married 8 coming up 9 years. Had been together a few years before. It was a great couple of years before and after the marriage. The usual family troubles on both sides and similar but that's been sorted one way or another. We have a little boy together and she had a older son from a previous partner who's married and left the nest. Both of them are awesome kids. I am self employed' have been since way before I met her. She has had numerous jobs in the past but not so much the last year where it worked out better for both of us that she helped me with my work. Luckily we have no money issues, we are not rich but we get by with a bit extra for a odd treat here and there. 


Fast forward to 3 maybe 4 years ago, things had been slowly going off the boil with us. I was working more, she was looking after the house and did a part time job. I assumed this was what being a 'normal' married couple was like.  We still spoke, we went out for weekly date night and generally got on great still but slowly we had got a lot less intimate.


Then out the blue A was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She went in for the operation a month after the results came back. They had given her a hysterectomy. She started the long road to recovery. Thankfully she's a trooper, she has a real positive attitude and just took it in her stride. I was dead proud of her. 

Its terrible of me to say and feel this but this was the beginning of us falling apart, let me explain a bit more.

I though we still got on great. We didn't have sex though, this was took straight off the table and for good reason I thought. A few months after her op we tried and it hurt her, plus she said having the hysterectomy and her other bits out she couldn't get any pleasure from sex anymore and the body wasn't making any hormones so she didn't ever feel like wanting to be intimate. She explained it as the equivalent of being castrated. 



A while later we are sat in our lads school on a school disco, I was sat behind her at the table and spotted her deleting messages. I trusted her, thought nothing of it. In bed that night her phone started vibrating while she was in the bathroom, we never had locks or anything on phones, and often put each others on charge behind the bed. as I turned the phone over the screen lit up and the message on the screen read 'fuck tomorrow'. 


I felt sick, I was working away the next 2 days and was in no mood to confront her at that point about it. I went to work for the next 2 days, my brother was working with me on the installation and I had to tell him as he knew something was up. I came back and asked her for her phone and if she had anything to tell me. She handed me her phone and wanted to know what was going on, I told her what I saw that night and wanted to be alone for a while to think. There was some flirty texts, one of which her offering to give him a blowjob but nothing to say she went through with it. She had deleted everything received, and I can only assume sent.

She explained this all away as it was this other guy just being dirty and she had some text fun, I had words with the guy who had been messaging who also had a girlfriend and he was adamant nothing happened it was just him being stupid. I took a few days thinking about what to do, in my head I wanted to leave and had all but mentally checked out but i'm ashamed to say I stayed as I didn't want to miss my little boy growing up. Her excuse for not being able to tell me was she couldn't remember what had been sent by either of them. 
I suppose to all intents and purposes I tried to forgive her as I didn't have enough proof to act on anything. 
It was the first time I knew she had done anything like this and I was stuck in limbo. I wanted to leave but didn't at the same time. In a selfish way what the fuck was she being all sexy and flirty with another guy for when shes left me out to dry for the last 12 months. That's the bit that hurt the most, it came across as something was wrong with me, what the fuck did she see in this bloke that was better than me all of a sudden.



So that's where I am up to 6 months ago. I spent the last year or two playing husband going through the motions, still doing date nights, still doing holidays and family stuff. From the outside everything probably looks normal, we still get on fine but more like room mates or good friends than a couple.  No one knew about the past apart from my brother. I've tried to forget/forgive/move on but there's this nagging feeling that won't go away and I cant let go. I've never really had a good explanation of what happened, what messages were sent and why. There's no closure in it for me but its been so long now I don't think bringing it up again would actually be of any use to either of us. 

Since a few months before Christmas we started arguing over stupid things I have said during a conversation with her. I normally haven't got a clue what I've said wrong or how it could be misinterpreted but she does. She picks up on a point to argue about and keeps saying don't you remember saying this, well no I don't remember, its not that I forgot I just don't see why I would have said that. Sometimes though to be fair I can see how she can pick at it to make it point but normally I just give up and agree its my fault as I don't think its worth arguing about. 


I'd agreed to disagree before for a easy life but last night was the final straw. She went to a hospital appointment on her own as I was still 150 miles away driving home. She phoned to say how it went then out the blue she said why are you laughing, its not a laughing matter. I honestly was not laughing, I don't know how she thought I was laughing, I said the word 'right' but i'm wrong again. She hung up and I got home about 3 hours later. I went into the bedroom to see her, tried my best but just done another 18 hour day and wasn't in the mood for the bullshit, it ended in a argument and I slept on the sofa.

This morning she carried it on. I didn't raise my voice but wouldn't let her get away with her interpretation of the events which surprised the hell out of me as it was completely different to what actually happened. She forgot about the bit when I came in from work and said hello, lay on the bed next to her, us bickering as she had some shitty condescending attitude on her and then me getting up leaving the room, coming back in and it blowing up. 
In her head I came home from work, shouted at her from the bedroom door and that was it.
She looked scared and angry, told me I'm mental and now scaring her and need to go see a doctor and then left the house to god knows where. She had completely forgot about the first bit of of our disagreement and looked scared that she couldn't remember, then decided I was just making it up and told me as such. I'm stood there in my boxers in the hall watching her walk out the door wondering did that really happen. 


I have no idea what is going on in her head, but I can tell you this and it saddens me to say it but I didn't feel sorry for her at all. In fact I felt nothing, not a ounce of anything, it's like there's nothing left in my heart to give. I don't want to try and help her any more, I've removed myself to the spare bedroom where I've been typing this for the last god knows how many hours and have no idea how I'm going to feel or what to do next when the morning comes around.


Sorry for the essay, it feels so much better out here in the open than going around in circles in my head.

"I [45F] am getting extremely sensitive by the age difference comments about my SO [38M]


Back story here:

4 years ago, my ex husband [48M] cheated on me with his PA [26F] and then wanted to reconcile claiming mid life crisis. It's the oldest, most boring story in the book.

I decided not to take him back as our kids had grown up and I didn't see a future in the marriage. When I told him I didn't want to work things out, over text, email, voicemail and in person, he called old, unattractive, washed up, used up, past my prime and tried me to make me feel like no one would ever want me again. One time he did this in public, at a family event, at my son's birthday party. My son, being a better man than his father, left the restaurant with me and didn't speak his father for over 2 months because of it.

I wasn't even going to tell my kids why we were divorcing but my ex told them himself in an effort to get their sympathy and then got surprised when it backfired. 

To him, he's some victim of a mistake and I didn't given him a second chance after nearly 20 years of marriage.

Rather than make me insecure, it made me furious and I was never more sure of my decision to divorce. He then turned all sweet and charming and said he was lashing out because he was afraid of loosing me. 

I didn't believe him then either. At that time, some of it was insecurity- if he can get a 20 something to have sex with him, why on earth would he want me? It didn't feel real. 

Then he moved in with his PA, got married the moment our divorced was finalized and then that marriage crashed and burned 1 year after it happened because she cheated on him. He tried coming back to me then as well, but it didn't work.

During that time, I was transitioning from a SAHM to getting back into the workforce but through connections, I found a job in a not for profit and am doing well now. I also suffered a huge blow to my self esteem because of my ex husband and there were times I felt so worthless.

I started going to the gym, looking after myself, finding hobbies, travelling etc and turning my loneliness into solitude instead. I was very determined not to be that bitter 40 year old woman who's life revolves around bad mouthing her ex. This seemed to make my ex husband more angry but I realized he was always trying to get a rise out of me so I would pay him any attention at all. My age in particular was the butt of make of his jibes which is maybe why I'm so sensitive to these comments.

About 1 year ago, I joined a hiking group on Meetup and I met my SO doing that on a doing a 22 day trek that was wildly out of my comfort zone but I felt great once I'd done it- I'm nearly 50 after all! And we really bonded over that.

I'm aware that there's an age difference but it's only 7 years as we are at the same stage of our lives- he's also divorced with kids (his wife cheated on him), he's got a very good career (as a director in a company), we share a lot of the same values, experiences and I feel like he respects me and is attracted to me despite my age.

It's not like I'm preying on someone half my age or who I have power over. 

My friends and family though, always make jokes about how I'm dating a younger man and tease me for being like my ex for chasing a man in his 30s and how I'm a cougar or cradle robber.

Now I get the cradle robber just is just funny because well, he's 38 so I can laugh at that but the comparisons to my ex hurt the most.

When I defend myself they just tell me I'm joking and then I feel like an idiot for being overly sensitive.

To me though, those comments are inappropriate but I always feel like a wet blanket if I point them out. The only people who haven't batted an eyelid are our kids funnily enough.

  **tl;dr**: How do I make these comments hurt less? Or handle it with better grace?"

"My GF [28f] has zero self worth. It's exhausting and Im [33m] leaving her. Help me do this right. 2 years together. 8 months living together.


This may go long but there's some juicy tidbits in there for ya. 

My girlfriend and I have been fighting a lot recently about sticking up for ourselves. She never does it. I have a stronger personality than her and she simply thinks its something I was born with. No. It's work to stick up for yourself. It's a conscious decision. I feel like she simply sits around and waits for life to happen to her. She doesnt take action. For instance, a big bomb in our relationship was when her and her sisters found out about a secret half brother. Her dad cheated on her mom and had a kid. Not good. But none of them will confront him on it. They simply wallow in unhappiness and fake it when he comes around. To me, in my family, that's absolute craziness. Everyone is on deck to be called out for shitty behavior. And people make mistakes. Its ok. The mom forgave him. But the girls just let it fester and the wound just gets worse. 

Consequently, our relationship pays the price for dad's infidelity AND her ex's manipulative behavior. Shes suspicious of everything I do. She gave me a dirty look for touching her sisters shoulder when she had these spiky gold, well, spikes on her shirt. I introduced her to old friends and she asked all these questions about the girls, but none of the guys. A guy is excited to see me for the first time in years...just my buddy. A girl is excited to see me for the first time in years...I'm obviously cheating on her with all of them lol. I asked her about it and she claims she doesn't remember any of the jealousy parts. Before, she even held it against me that I had another quick date before our first date. I never even knew her yet! But she uses that as evidence that I'm not to be trusted and I'm going to abandon her. 

She just doesn't understand that she is worth sticking up for. Her life goals are worth making a fuss over. If she wants something she should work with people to get it, not just take what people give her. If you let people walk all over you then you're at their mercy. That's how she feels. Powerless. At everyone's mercy. I feel like this is a basic difference in how we view life and how we achieve our goals. I'm not even sure she has goals because she doesn't think she could ever achieve them. 


Conversation:

GF: I'm worthless *crying*

Me: What do you do that makes you feel worthwhile?

GF: I do things for you. I do things for my bosses. 

Me: No what do *you* do for *you* that makes you feel good?

GF: I told you. I do things for you. I do things for other people.

Me: You're not understanding the question. Name a thing you do that you like to do.""

GF: Hang out. Make you happy. 

Ugh. That's an oppressive responsibility to me. Her self worth is based on my happiness? I dont want that. Nobody but a psychopath wants that. I don't want to be the sole shareholder of her entire sense of self.

I just dont think she understands the concept of self love and building a sense of self.  It's like she's simply a victim of whatever everyone else thinks of her. In her world, there is no discussion. Whatever other people think or say about her, they're right. It's almost like whoever speaks first gets what they want. I know Asian culture and Southern Baptist culture is very obedient to your elders, but I'm not an elder. I'm her equal. She's an adult now. Her parents are equals. Her cheating dad. Equal. But how can I be her equal when she thinks she's nothing? 

She won't get therapy. I've tried that game. Speaking about her feelings is overwhelmingly frightening for her. Please help. What can I say?

As for me, I truly don't feel close to my girlfriend. I connect with people through conversation, same interests, building something creative together. For her, its simply occupying nearby space. No emotional or mental connection is necessary, in fact, that's actually a lot of effort for her. It's exhausting just to try to have a conversation. It's like a game of catch where I throw the ball, then she throws it halfway back, so I have to walk over, pick up the ball and throw it back. Then she throws it back again halfway. So I walk over, pick up the ball...you get it. Eventually you learn to stop throwing the ball. That's where we're at. It's miserable because she's miserable. How do I get her to go to therapy? How do I get her to put away her mean ex bf and her cheating father? Our relationship pays the price for other people's mistakes. I'm not mean to her. I never cheated on her. But I'm not trusted anyway. Thats not right to me. 

I'm leaving her. Help me let her down easy. I'm expecting a nightmare of tears and low self esteem. But I feel like my strong personality is a shield she hides behind. She doesn't have to develop her own means of self protection and self worth because she can use mine. I worry if I break up with her she's just going to do the same thing with another bf. I want her to be strong and confident and willing to accept love. But its just not happening. I can stick it out until the end of our lease together if it means she'd be ok and not in a dark place afterwards. Please help me help her.

"I [23F] take care of my younger brother [17M] but I don't want to anymore. [Update]


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62844h/i_23f_take_care_of_my_younger_brother_17m_but_i/)

Thank you to everyone that replied to my last post, I want to give you all an update since some people were asking. 

So that night I went over to Jay's and talked to him about everything that was going on, and he said he would have a talk with Ian about respect/communication. Ian stayed the weekend with Jay so that we could have some time away from each other and Jay talked to him about respect/communication/basically everything that was going on. 

I came home Friday after work and my whole house was cleaned! Jay and Ian both cleaned it while I was gone and it was really unexpected. It was very sweet of them. 

On Sunday Jay dropped Ian off at our apartment. I just got a 24 hour notice that we are having a property inspection, so I told Ian to make sure everything is picked up and that there is no marijuana or anything left out and not to smoke until the inspection is done because we live in a state where it is still illegal (he gets it from Jay and smokes on occasion, another issue I've had and forgot to mention in my last post). He said okay no problem.

A few hours later I go downstairs and the entire place reeks of marijuana. This happened after I explicitly told him not to smoke or have anything out because our property manager would be coming by in the morning. I was livid. At that point I went to his room and confronted him and he tried lying about it, but it was clear he was smoking because the whole house smelled like it and it didn't when he was gone. He also has done this in the past when we were having our A/C fixed, literally the exact same situation, and he did it again today. I could be evicted and lose my security deposit for this and I do not want to lose my place. All because he couldn't refrain from getting high for 1 day.

I called Jay and told him what was going on, and he was pretty mad, because he just preached to Ian about us respecting each other and then this happens right away. Jay told me to tell Ian to gather a few things because he's going to stay with him for a few days. I go and tell Ian, and he tells me he would just rather move in with Jay indefinitely.

So Jay came and picked up Ian and they packed a few of his things, and are getting the rest later once Jay and his wife clear out his basement. Ian told me he loved me before he left so I'm happy he at least doesn't hate me. Jay is 27 and is very responsible, and I know he will be able to care for him properly and hopefully give him the discipline he needs because I can't do it.

And that's where we're at now. This whole taking care of my younger brother before I've had a chance to figure out myself yet has really taken a toll on me, I just feel defeated. I feel really guilty and told Jay, but he said I need to look out for myself for once, and that Ian said he's happy things ended like this rather than things getting worse to the point where we're fighting. 

I'm in the process of looking for a roommate and don't think I'll have a problem finding one, but the uncertainty that I might not find one in a month is really gnawing at me. I am just full of so much anxiety right now. Ian also just paid his share of the rent and asked about getting it back, but since this wasn't expected and he decided to move out right away anyway without giving me a chance to find a replacement I need to keep it. I don't know how to politely tell him he isn't getting it back. I am going to need to have carpets cleaned before I get a roommate since he spilled a lot of things and did some damage to our carpet, and he never paid a security deposit (he didn't have money at the time), and will be using part of his rent to cover the cost. He also took the PS4 and most of the items I bought for his bathroom.

Thank you everyone who read this and replied and for all your kind words and advice. It has been a long stressful few months and I'm hoping things will look up soon.

My long term (5 year) boyfriend has been wanting to play guitar since he was a kid. He just recently bought a guitar and is learning to play on his own. I'm really proud of him for taking this step and making himself practice, but, like most new musicians, he sounds awful. 

The guitar is loud, the apartment is small, and there is no escape when he decides to practice for an hour in the evening. His practice sessions are random, too, so I can't plan to be out of the house for a while.

This guy Colter from my swimming class asked me out about two weeks ago, he seemed ok and I was bored so I said yes.

He tried to kiss me at the end of the date. I sort of ducked out of the way and said I was flattered but that I really wasn't interested in s relationship. He made a snide remark about why did I let him pay for dinner then and I reminded him that I paid for the movie and snacks so if anything we were even. He tried to play it off like a joke and said fair enough and we said goodbye.

He sees me between classes and wants to walk with me, he just ""happened to be"" in my assigned parking lot (his is a shuttle lot, literally across town) and about two minutes ago even though he doesn't live on campus he just happened to be In the union dining hall because ""he does that sometimes"" (this is my second year living on campus and I've never seen him in here). He always wants to just chat and catch up...but we literally have nothing to catch up about because NO KIDDING I've run into him 30 times since Monday morning. 

He's harmless and I'm not afraid of him but he's annoying the crap out of me. I'm not a mean person and I kind of feel bad in telling him to leave me alone and I guess technically he's allowed to be on campus wherever he wants...so how do I end this?

"Me [26F] with my mother [53F], she wants me to change my wedding date to accommodate my father, whom I barely speak to as it is.


My father and I have not had a good relationship. My mother and he are married and we see each other semi frequently, but we don't talk. There's nothing to talk about, we barely relate to each other. He can be rude and hurtful and I prefer to not interact with him because I always end up really upset and I prefer to not feel that way. 

He works in government, and has for over 20 years, for natural resources. 2 years ago there were some dramatics involving a new colleague who wanted to have her name on some papers that my father and another long term colleague were working on. I don't know the details but according to my mom, the woman doesn't have many credentials to speak of, has never written her own papers, and is a 'ditz'. Anyway, he said no to her and she filed a complaint saying he was extremely rude to her, and that his colleague 'threw her against a wall' (??) anyway. Very odd situation and he was suspended for 5 days without pay 2 years ago. I thought this was it, but my mother told me he just found out he has a hearing for these events on the day of my wedding and 100% cannot get out of it. Okay. I mean I get it. It's his career and he needs to attend. Although I will say that there seems to be more to the situation if they're still going on about it after he was already punished 2 years ago but it's not my business. 

As a result, obviously he cannot attend my small courthouse wedding. My mother messaged me asking if I would move the date at least 2 weeks later (apparently the Friday after the original date is no good either but she didn't say why). Let me be clear, this is a very small and cheap ceremony. We don't want anything big, but we've already requested the time off of work. I started a new job at a hotel and I am already pushing it by asking for time off in mid-May, considering that's when business starts to ramp up. I don't want to come back and ask for days off in early June especially when I have no seniority and have all of 3 days under my belt. He has already requested his vacation time at his work and it was approved. There is not a good chance he'll be able to get time off in June either. 

To be frank, I don't want to change it. We've already told other family and friends and plans have been made. The date also feels right to us. I don't feel I should have to change it to please my father, whom I barely speak to. I would actually be LESS anxious about the whole affair if he wasn't present. As well, we would still see him after, at dinner. My mother is upset with my resistance. They are a religious family and tradition is important, so having my father there to 'walk me down the aisle' is a big thing. I personally don't feel my father has any right to 'give me away' considering how poorly things have gone over the years. However, me refusing to change the date I feel will insult them greatly, and I understand that people have different values and traditions and I'm not saying that it's a bad thing for a father to give a daughter away but it also doesn't quite align with my values, even if we WERE close. 

My question is: is this a hill worth dying on? Should I just try to move the date to appease them? Or am I in the right to just leave it as planned?

"I [23F] take care of my younger brother [17M] but I don't want to anymore.


Hi I will try and keep this as short as possible.. My dad went to prison and my parents lost their home in December 2015, forcing them to move into my older brother Jay's place. My little brother Ian was 16 at the time, and he moved into Jay's basement, where he was sleeping on a concrete slab so I decided to take him in. I was with my boyfriend of 2 years at the time, and we decided to take him in since we had an extra room. 

Some background info: My parents were neglectful alcoholics and never made my younger siblings clean or cleaned anything themselves. My parents had like 5 inbred chihuahuas and 10 cats, and the house was always a chaotic mess. My little brother spent most of his childhood just locked in his room playing video games. He dropped out of High School when he was 15 and I can't get him to get his GED and he won't go back to H.S.

So Ian started living with me in January 2016, but it has been getting harder and harder to deal with him since. My ex boyfriend cheated on me last July so I broke up with him, and I was essentially forced to take care of my little brother on my own. I have my own small business but it doesn't make a lot of profit, and he works with me as well, making $12 an hour. I now have a nice 2 bed/2 bath place so he has it really good here. He pays a 1/3 of the rent and also his half of utilities. I cook dinner 3-4 times a week by myself and buy groceries. He always has extra spending money for his own food but I keep everything stocked. 

I also pay for him to have his own phone and we have 5GB of data between us. But he always uses all the data and I have been charged so many times for going over the data, I've started turning off his data but then his behavior gets worse and he's mopey. He works for me so I can take it out of his pay, but then he can't afford rent. He also won't have the full amount of rent when it's due and tells me to just take it out of his pay, which is frustrating.

There just have been so so many issues and I am about at my breaking point. He used to set his drinks on the floor in the livingroom and spill them, and not clean it up. I would have to tell him multiple times to keep his drinks off the ground because i don't want my place turning into my parents. 

Then this Winter he wanted the temperature at 74* (!!), I keep it at 71* and told him and put a note on the thermostat to NOT turn it up. I came home from class and it was hot as hell, and lo and behold he turned it up again. I told him again very nicely not to turn up the thermostat, to which he called me multiple names (b****, austisic?) because his feet were cold and he felt he should be in charge of the thermostat. This happened right after I bought him a new PS4, so I took it away for a few days for his behavior. Since then he has kept it in his room (it was in the livingroom so we both could use it for games/movies) and he stays in his room all day playing games. 

The only times I see him are when I make dinner and yell that it's ready, or when we work together. Other than that he keeps to himself. He doesn't do any chores around the house (something we've talked about multiple times) and his bedroom and bathroom are always disgusting. Whenever I tell him to clean his room he won't. He hoards dishes in his room and there are empty soda cans all over the floor in his bedroom, and we are starting to have a serious ant problem now that the weather is warming up. These are just a few small instances but I feel like this is too much for me to handle. I am graduating in the Fall and am completing an internship, all while running a business and working and I feel completely stuck. I don't feel like I should have to put up with this, especially since he doesn't care about me at all. 

I've gained about 30 pounds over the last 3 months from all the stress and am so miserable. I am crying just typing all this out because it really seems unfair (but life isn't fair right?). I was in therapy for a few months last year for depression and anxiety and it helped immensly, but can no longer afford it as my little brother eats up a lot of my money. My older brother knows about what's going on and has talked to him a few times, but I'm starting to realize that Ian is just lazy. Jay has offered to take him in if it gets too rough and I'm thinking of taking him up on that offer, but I want to hear your guys thoughts and advice first. He turns 18 in November, so I don't know if I need to suffer until then, or if I should ask my older brother to take him in. My parents also don't contribute (mom doesn't work/is an alcoholic), and are living in an RV on a friends property. 

Thanks for reading.

  **tl;dr**: I have been taking care of my little brother for over a year now and feel forced to take care of him. My mental/emotional health is really suffering. He is very lazy and disrespectful and I want to live my own life. I don't know if I should ask my older brother to take him in or tough it out until he is 18."

"(Relationships) Me [24m] with my gf [28f] of two years, just wished her a happy birthday. It's not her birthday, it's my exes birthday.


I've been with my girlfriend for two years and absolutely love her. I've been stressed at work and working a lot of overtime for the last few weeks, and it's made my mind go foggy. I feel like me working so much has put some stress on our relationship, and I wanted to try to be sweet and show my girlfriend that I love her and still think about her even though I'm so busy, so I bought her a birthday card and wrote a message to give to her at midnight on her birthday (I had more planned for her birthday, this was just the first thing).

I gave her the card and told her happy birthday and she was really confused. It was then that I realized it wasn't her birthday. We both had a laugh for a second but I know she is a little upset. Her birthday is later this month, I was just a bit early. I always get confused around April and dates; my mother and father both have their birthday in April as well as their anniversary and I can never remember which day celebrates which event. Our anniversary is in a couple of months and shares the same numerical day of the month as when I told her happy birthday, so I thought I may have mixed those days up. 

Like I said, I gave her the card and told her happy birthday at midnight. Fast forward to the morning. I check Facebook and see a notification to wish someone a happy birthday. It's my ex.

I'm worried about how my girlfriend will feel once she finds out. I think they are friends or at least have mutual friends, not to mention my mother wished her happy birthday so it will show up on her feed, so I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is going to see it. She already has some insecurities because of past relationships, and because of how clean of a breakup my ex and I had after dating for a few years with little drama. I love my girlfriend dearly, I plan to spend the rest of my life with her and propose this year, but I'm worried about how she will react and handle it when she finds out it's my exes birthday. She handles things really well, but I'm worried about what will come of this. Should I talk to her about it now or just try to ride it out and hope it never comes back up?
  
 TL;DR - Wished my girlfriend a happy birthday on what apparently is my exes birthday. She isn't aware yet but will likely find out. Do I confront it now, or wait to see if it ever comes up again? Thanks in advance.

"I [23M] am moving in to a flat share with [25F] and [27F]. My room is by far the smallest in the flat but we all pay the same rent. How do I ask to pay less rent without giving a bad first impression?


I've just signed a tenancy in a new flat with two existing flatmates. They've lived there for a couple of years and I've only met them once on the day that I viewed the flat. 


Both of their bedrooms are significantly bigger than mine; my room is very small and doesn't even have room for a wardrobe, whereas the other rooms have big built in wardrobes, a desk, and more floor space than my room. I found out that we all pay the same amount of rent to the live-out landlord, which doesn't seem fair at all. One of the flatmates pays the whole rent to the landlord, with the other tenants paying that flatmate a day before the rent comes out so the way the rent is split is decided by tenants, not the landlord. 



I move in on Monday, and I'm not sure how to bring it up that I want to weight the rent based on the size of the room. We have a group chat on Facebook, and I'm torn between mentioning it now on Facebook, or whether it's a better idea to wait until they've got to know me a bit first before bringing it up. I don't want their first impression of me to be negative, but I think I have a valid point and that it should be addressed as soon as possible. 


Tldr: just moved in to an existing flat share and the rent isn't weighted fairly. Do I bring this up now over Facebook or wait a while until they have got to know me? 


EDIT:
I wont bring up the difference in rent. You've made me see that although the rent isnt split fairly, i should have queried the splitting of the rent before agreeing to the price, and there's nothing I can do about it now. I considered the room to be worth what I paid before discovering how the rent was split, so their share is irrelevant at this point, despite the flatmates getting better value for their money. Thanks for showing me the other side of the argument!"
