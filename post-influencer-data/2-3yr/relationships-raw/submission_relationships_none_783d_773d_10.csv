"I'm [28M] never had a relationship with my sisters [35F]/[31F] because of the way my culture views gender. Is it too late?


I come from a conservative Indian background that values men more than women. As a result I never really had a relationship with my sisters because we never really played together as kids and I went to separate schools. 

As the youngest kid and as the only boy I was quite spoiled growing up and it's only now that I'm starting to realize how much.

For example

- My grandparents always compliment me on my achievements, my sisters just get asked when they're getting married.

- My dad spent time playing with me but not my sisters growing up.

- My sisters know how to cook and clean but I don't because my mum does it for me. My wife had to teach me. 

- I went to a good private school, my sisters only to a public school because we could only afford to send one of us to private school and they assume my sisters would get married and leave the family. Their grades are as good as or better than mine. Both of them have PhDs, I'm just a chartered accountant. 

- My parents hated it when my sisters stayed out late due to work, they wanted them home by 7pm. Every time one my sisters want to go out late, it was a fight. I on the other hand, came and went as I chose. 

- I'm favoured now due to the fact that I'm married and have a daughter (6 months) but none of my sisters' achievements matter because they are in their 30s and unmarried.

It look me awhile a moving out of home to address some of my own issues around gender and stereotypes. By then my sisters had moved to another state together (against my parents will) because they didn't want an arranged marriage and hated the pressure so we lost touch except for texts about birthday presents for our parents or if one of us were visiting home.

It didn't used to bother me but now that I have a daughter of my own and got the ""better luck next time"" or ""I'll pray for son for you next time"" comments- I was brought really rudely down to earth because I can't fathom in my mind, that anyone could look at my daughter's face and then be disappointed. And now I can't bear the thought that she's going to grow up and know that people will be disappointed in her just because she's not a boy and I want to never talk to my family again.

It's also starting to make me think my dad must be a psychopath or something because how do you look at your daughters and then ignore them? My heart hurts when my daughter cries even if I know it's just because she needs to be fed or hates having her diaper changed- I couldn't imagine not caring at all. 

To top things off, my best friend has a great relationship with his sister. Just yesterday he posted an image to her wall on FB saying ""how to people make it through life without an older sister?"" for her birthday. She's 37 and unmarried but my friend sticks up for her all the time and his family is not as conservative as mine which helps. I'm starting to see that I should have been more the same. 

To top things off, I always see my sisters doing things together, taking trips and having a great time and I've started to realize how much that I've missed out and also how much my daughter is missing out. 

I don't know how to start making amends. I would much prefer my daughter to be around the type of women my sisters are than my own father and family. I'm already dreading the way that my family will treat my daughter. I don't want her to go through the same things my sisters did. 

It's definitely my fault for not doing something sooner- I guess it was easier to live with the status quo and not make a fuss but what do I do but I would like to change that if possible. They've never displayed any animosity towards me though I don't blame them for being resentful if they were about how they've been treated. I wouldn't be surprised if they hated me actually.

"UPDATE: ""My husband [M42] and I [M32] (together 6 years) fought last night""


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pm1qj/my_husband_m42_and_i_m32_together_6_years_fought/

I want to thank all of you for your comments and support; they made me realize really how shitty of a relationship I was in.  I did return home from my business trip, and after another physical incident, I said that was enough.  I called my parents (who are awesome), and my dad (who is awesome) came and helped me to safely get out.  We were even able to get my car out (its in only my name, and the lease is held by a major bank).  Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now.  In hindsight I should have gotten out *way* sooner, but hindsight is a bitch.

During this process, the tribal courts and tribal police were way more helpful than I had expected.  A distant cousin of my spouse in the court actually helped us by writing a letter which would have compelled access to my car (and how to work the system), even though civil matters weren't his area and the obvious relationship.  (We didn't end up officially using the letter since we couldn't get is signed by a judge in time). The police were very understanding, and felt my request was extremely reasonable, and they did everything they could do to make sure the retrieval went smoothly.

So after an over-night stay in a major PNW city, getting the car to a transport service, and a cross-country flight, I am safely with my parents now.  It's not the house I grew up in, but it still feels like home.  And by the way, my boss and his boss are fantastic.  They have been nothing but understandable and willing to work with me so far, and that is absolutely fantastic.

So now I begin the process of rebuilding.  I'm going to focus on me, and do things I want to do which I know I wil enjoy.  I *will* rebuild myself financially and emotionally (my spouse subtly and not so subtly siphoned off resources by not having much free cash of his own, since he kept buying shit), and I will rebuild relationships which have frayed either due to alienation or distance.  Friends I have already talked to have been nothing but supportive, and I have warned them my spouse might try to manipulate them to get to me.

What about my spouse you may be wondering?  Well, as soon as he realized that I had left his parents' house, turned off a family locator app, and was not answering his calls, he tried to guilt his way back to me.  He supposedly had a nervous breakdown, and was admitted to a local hospital off reservation.  When I landed last night there were messages from him that he had moved to the psych ward at a larger regional hospital, that he was going to try and get money back to me that I had given him for closing costs on the home purchase, and that he was sorry.  While if that is really the case, I'm sorry it happened that way, but I have the closure I need, and from now on I need to focus on myself.

"I'm [23F] pulling my hair out over the fact that my bf [27M] is in trouble at work for acting aggressively and not watching his freakin mouth when speaking to coworkers. He wants me to hold him while he boohoos and I'm over it.


Basically my bf thinks of himself as a fighter for justice at his job and takes it upon himself to try to tackle any perceived injustice that's happening.

For instance: at some point a mix up had happened and he and a coworker weren't getting paid for sick days. He marched into his bosses office and raised his voice and demanded pay for both of them. Boss told him to watch his attitude but eventually both bf and other dude got their pay. Bf told the other guy but was never thanked. In fact, the other guy thanked God and went on with his day. I told him he needs to watch his mouth and using curses with his boss is immature. I also told him stop marching in there and demanding things for other people because none of your coworkers care about you, nor have they ever stuck their neck out for you. Theyre the smart ones!!

Another instance, bf was leaving work an hour early because he felt he completes his work early every day, and that he carries the brunt of the work (this not requested of him. He picks up other people's slack because HE WANTS TO) Boss called him out and once again they got into a heated verbal argument where they got into each other's face. Boss told him to stop and just let him know who isn't working but bf continued leaving early because he feels that's his right. Bf also told me he believes that arguing means his boss respects him and that he's ""basically"" second in command. Again, I told him watch your damn mouth, you're not second in command, and you are replaceable as an employee. Watch your footing because if you keep taking a mile when offered an inch you'll fall off the cliff. Again, nope, he respects me and knows that I help him run things. He wont get rid of me, he needs me. Bf left early EVERY DAY since that conversation.

ANOTHER instance, 3 fellow employees got in trouble for getting to work late the same day. It was a busy stressful day and their presence was sorely needed. They all trickled in with the latest being 20 minutes late due to the subway messing up. There's an employee-boss group chat where the boss chewed these three guys out and in the end wrote them all up. The boss also chewed out the rest of the employees and said that there was work that wasn't done and everyone needs to try harder.

Bf of course is horribly distressed that they got in trouble because it ""was only 20 minutes!!"" And he was personally offended by the boss saying work needs to be finished. (If the shoe fits, huh?) So bf matches into bosses office and demands that boss tells him what exactly was not finished. Like, get any paperwork or get online and show him whats not finished. He also told boss that he should've asked him if the guys were late enough to warrant being in trouble.

Aaaand they argued. And argued. Bf admitted that he was aggressive in speaking to boss and got in his face telling him that he didn't know how to run the place. Boss got in his face back and they were cursing at each other. Honestly, bf is very lucky his boss is a physically large gutsy guy and not easily frightened because if it was a different person with less patience I have no doubt that he would've been escorted off the premises.

So boss told him he'd ""handle him later."" Bf kind of laughed it off and said since he's in a union nothing is going to happen to him. I told him AGAIN that you need to stop this! You can't bark at your boss and speak to people like you're in a bar fight. You can't bully people into listening to you, you cannot forget that you are REPLACEABLE. Bf told him he'd standing up for what's right since boss was taking his frustration out on everyone. I told him STOP TRYING TO SPEAK FOR YOUR COWORKERS. NO ONE ELECTED YOU AS A SPOKESPERSON. And no one has defended bf because you go to work to get paid! Not skate on thin ice for some asshole that yells at the boss!! Bf assured me that what's right is right and that the Charlottesville protesters were hurt for standing for what's right, and that this is similar. Basically he's a good person being punished for trying to do what's good.

Well, later came. 3 write ups at once for language + aggressiveness, leaving early, and disobedience, basically. 3 write ups means unpaid suspension, possibly termination in the worst instances.

NOW HE'S UPSET. I asked him how many times I've told him to mind his damn business and act like he's got some sense. Now he's weepy and scared. His schedule will also be changing to graveyard shifts when he gets back (so he'll never see the boss again, basically) instead of his 7am-3pm. He said theyre still deliberating on if he'll be kept at all but theyre changing things around for the time being. I'm pulling my hair out and part of me honestly wants to leave. This is so stupid. So many chances were given to him! What the hell!

I don't know what to do. He wants emotional support and cuddles and I can barely look at him right now. I've never felt so disgusted and unattracted to anyone the way I feel right now. What is the next step when you've been telling someone something they refused to listen to and now they want your help? I am so, so angry.

Tl;dr: bf acted like an ass multiple times and finally got in trouble for it. What happens after ""I told you so""? Am I really supposed to support him through this?"

"I [23F] just broke up with my boyfriend [23M] of one year because of his obsession with marijuana. Everyone is acting like it's no big deal and that I'm crazy or out of touch.


Hi r/relationships. I hope it's okay that I am posting this with a throwaway account because people I know irl know my main and I don't want this drama all over it.

**Firstly, I will say as a disclaimer that even though I have never smoked/eaten/taken marijuana and don't ever plan to, I have no objection to it. I think it should be legal for adults and sold like alcohol. I don't think anyone should be arrested for it and the war on drugs has not been effective. I don't use but I have no problem with other who uses for medical or recreational reasons. I don't care if you use, I just don't want to smell it or be around it when you do.**

The story is that I [23F] just broke up with my boyfriend [23M] of one year because I could not handle his obsession with marijuana. He talked about marijuana almost 24/7. Everything was about when he smoked last and when he would smoke again. He entered into a 2 year MA program after he did his undergrad and he almost got kicked out of his dorm for smoking marijuana because of the fact that it is illegal here and from the smell. He had free bordering at the school from a grant but he decided to move out and pay rent in an apartment so he could smoke there more freely.

In our state marijuana is completely illegal for any reason. Our state does not have diversion and possessing anything over 2 ounces is a felony. If he had gotten caught with it in his apartment he would surely be evicted. His apartment was near a school and this is a 5 year sentence if caught. He also would use hash all the time and it's a felony also. Now I don't agree with the law and think it should be legal like I said above. But I think you need to be realistic about the reality where you live. He had no medical need and I couldn't believe he would risk going to jail for felonies over this. He also would drive after or while he was smoking marijuana and said it doesn't impair you to affect driving.

He would smoke the second he woke up, before every meal, when he got home from school and before bed. He had to smoke it at least 6 times a day every day or he would get so cranky and annoying to be around. Everything was about how great marijuana is and when he would smoke next. He smoked it before his grandmother's funeral and went there high, with red eyes and reeking. He actually argued with me and said marijuana does not smell even though his place and his car reek and he often smells of it. He had a part time job but he got fired because he would be late or not show up because he was off smoking and getting high instead.

I could not handle it anymore. I was second fiddle to it and he was about marijuana 24/7. I couldn't see a future with him and I couldn't imagine living with him because of his constant use and the smell. I stopped going to his place because it smelled so bad and he said he hated coming over to my apartment because I refused to let him smoke or bring marijuana inside. Now everyone single one of his friends and all of our mutual friends, and even a few of my friends who I have told say I am overreacting because marijuana is not a big deal and I need to stop being so uptight. Not one person has sided with me. I have been told stuff like there is no such thing as being addicted to marijuana or that you can't really drive high on weed as a danger because it doesn't make you a dangerous driver. I have been told I am too uptight to understand and I need to chill and smoke a blunt to relax.

Am I really that out of touch? Did I overreact here? I just can't believe that almost everyone feels so strongly that I am wrong and my boyfriend is right and should be supported over me. Even people like me who don't use say marijuana is not a big deal and is different than even cigarettes or alcohol or hard drugs.

"UPDATE: I (27M) gave my 1.5 year partner (25F), whose fiance died 2.5 years ago, an ultimatum after Reddit's advice.


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qzkz2/my_27m_partner_25f_of_15_years_whose/)

After all the replies I got, I told her that I was going to take a step back and let her figure out her thoughts and feelings since I felt completely neglected emotionally. It was now or never, I needed actions and not just hollow words.

We did not speak for a week and she never tried to contact me. We're now in the same city (we were in different countries for 1,5 months) and I went to pick up my stuff from her apartment yesterday.

She said she tried to fall in love with me but wasn't able to and she felt she could not reciprocate the feelings I had for her, although she does have feelings for me. It was a very emotional moment for both of us and she told me she didn't want me to stop talking to her. I told her that was not possible and I would not be contacting her again, as painful as it may be.

She said she will definitely go to counseling/therapy after I suggested it, but she can't ask me to wait for her and see if she gets better/wants to be with me in the future. She also finally told her family about the relationship that we had, but I guess it was just to prepare them because she knew I would not remain friends after this and they would wonder what happened to me since we were always together.

I feel devastated and just moved in to an apartment 2 blocks away from her. Everything in my apartment reminds me of her because she helped me shop for things (I started living alone right as we started going out), and I barely got any sleep last night.

Am I being immature for going completely no contact on her and erasing her from my life? We had great times together.

"Me [32 M]with my wife [28 F] she can't say no to people- I blew up at her today.


My wife is a sweet woman. She's smart and kind- but she's also a pushover. She hates to say no to people or feel like she's letting them down. As a result she's been taken advantage of before and even when she thinks something is up she still gets caught up. 

Some examples. Buying a bunch of magazines from a homeless guy going door to door for $100+. Getting pressured into selling MLM bullshit by 2 different friends. Letting 'friends' borrow money. There are a few others but you get the drift. 

Well she didn't work today and when I got home she told me she had bought a new vacuum from a door to door salesman for over 2000$!!! I lost it. We aren't poor but we don't have money for that. She said he came in to do a free demo and it was high pressure and she caved. 

Well I started yelling and told her I lost a lot of respect for her. I know I shouldn't have said that but frankly it's true. I can't understand how this happened. I'll be trying to get out of the contract(she financed the fucking thing fml) but I don't know what to do. How can we keep this from happening?

"My [24m] friend [22f] is embarrassing herself pursuing a girl who clearly isn't interested in her.


My friend Sarah has a lot of self-esteem issues. She's always been very quiet, shy, and introverted. Recently she's made a lot of positive changes in her life, including coming out as a lesbian, and is trying to be more outgoing. 


Unfortunately, she doesn't have a lot of experience with it and I've noticed she comes off as aggressive or irritating sometimes. I've tried explaining she needs to be more aware of people's cues (standoffish body language, one-word answers, etc.). She claims to understand what I mean and thinks she's trying but honestly in the moment it feels like she especially pursues people she doesn't get positive reactions from. Almost like she can't help but try to earn their approval. It never seems to go her way.  


There's a woman who works at a bookstore Sarah and I frequent. Sarah and this woman like the same podcast and Sarah found and friended this woman's Facebook profile through that podcast's facebook. At first the woman accepted her request but after a series of embarrassing and somewhat bizarre comments, she unfriended Sarah. Now Sarah tells me she's been bringing this woman various items at work, which the woman is rejecting. I've told Sarah outright she needs to stop pursuing this woman because she's made it clear she's not interested. But Sarah tuts me off with excuses for why this woman was too busy or not hungry and tries to discuss other plans to get this woman's attention. I've become aware some acquaintances are semi-mocking her behavior and the things she's said to her. I don't plan on telling her this but we have a tight knit community and I don't want this getting spread about so I'd like to nip this ASAP.    

tl;dr: My friend is trying to come out of her shell and I want to encourage that but I also need to explain to her she cannot *make* people like her. I would appreciate a lot of help with the wording, there's probably a lot going on with Sarah that I can't understand and I don't want to accidentally say the wrong thing. "

"I [35 M] really want to ask out my best friend [28 M] on a date. I've never been with another man before. Worried about ruining friendship.


So for context we met years ago at a gym. He was about 20 and I was 27. He was already a member when I started going. He talked to me my first day there and showed me the ropes (I'd never been to a gym before). He was super friendly and really helped me feel comfortable with the place. We started working out together a couple times a week, then one day after a workout he asked if I'd be interested in going on a date with him. I just kind of laughed it off and told him I wasn't gay. I told him we could definitely hang out though and he's more than welcome to buy me dinner whenever he wants. The rest is history. We did hang out and had an awesome time, we've been buds ever since.

Well over the last few years I believe my feelings for him have evolved... as dumb as that sounds. I just can't seem to get him out of my head lately. We've started talking more. Every day. It used to be once or twice a week. Now I text him good morning and he always texts me goodnight. We text when we can throughout the day.

I've been seeing more of him. I crave his company. When we are sitting watching movies or a game, I want to touch him. I want to hold his hand. I want to run my hand up his thigh. Jesus fuck... I can't even begin to explain the desire I have for him. It's overwhelming.

He's beautiful. I've always been aware he's a handsome dude but now it's different. So much different.

I constantly want to ask if I can take him out sometime, do that date I said no to all those years ago. However, I doubt I'm even on his radar anymore. I'm also really worried that if ask him and he says no its going to ruin what we have going, and I really wouldn't want to lose him as a friend. He's a great guy. I'd feel a little lost without him. 

Is this worth pursuing? Should I forget about asking him on a date? Am I going completely insane? Sometimes it feels like it.

I asked her a day after that post, so it's been six days. No jacket, I asked to her text when it was sent, nothing. I don't know whether to even care about it anymore, or just forget about the whole deal in general. I guess I'm just kind of mad at the whole situation.

First off: this is my first post, so thank you for reading.


A little background: I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with four roommates. Two females 24 & 25, and two males 23 & 24. A couple splits one of the bedrooms. The couple are both theater people. We've been living here for about a year and a half so far.


Last summer the girlfriend was away two months doing a residency for a theater show. She wasn't around *at all* since she was so far away (understandable) so we had no problem covering her portion of the electric bill since she literally wasn't coming back anytime during the summer.


This summer, though, for the months of July and August she is away again, but nearby for another theater production... but because it is so close in proximity to our apartment, she has been coming over and visiting for about a week at a time since she ""left"". (Her boyfriend lives here. It kinda makes sense.)


So understandably, this makes for a ""grey area"" when it comes to the electric bill for the month. We don't use the AC a lot, mostly since it is a source of tension/aggravation in the household between who uses it and when, but when she is here it goes on more often (even if she is, as she calls herself when visiting, ""a guest"").


I got this text message in our ""roommate group text"" yesterday morning presumably as she was on the train back to NJ, and... I.... honestly I'm speechless.


**TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT BECAUSE I CANNOT ADD LINKS: 
[image: screenshot of electric bill notice from her email inbox - roughly it's about $125.]
TEXT: ""Hi hi ConEd. I added up the days I visited in July - I was there for a total of 4 full days in July, plus 4 sleeps. That's roughly six full days. That's how many days I wasn't there in JUNE, so I won't be paying much toward the bill for July since it evens out - if that seems fair. Let me know if you want to talk about it, I'm open! In the mean time, total would be $40 each. I'm picking up like $5 of it."" ***


I'm sorry... what? WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS???


Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if all four of us went on a month-long vacation, the electric bill would still be roughly the same price. It doesn't fluctuate more or less that much if one less person is in the apartment.


I thought covering her portion of the electric made sense when she was too far away to visit, but now that she IS and is sending texts like this, shouldn't she contribute a little more than $5?


This entire thing just came off wrong, and it may be petty but I want to call her out on avoiding a normal face-to-face conversation as well... maybe because she knows how insane this sounds?


I can't talk about this with my other roommates for now unless i have a good grasp on what I want to say, since one of them is her boyfriend and sides with her on everything, and the other roommate is best friends with the boyfriend. I'm kinda outnumbered 3-to-1 in every situation.

While I don't want to pay more than I should, especially when I am not home often and the others use the AC (whenever I'm home I refuse to turn it on), I don't know if it's worth arguing this for a few dollars' difference. However, I do want her to be aware that I see what she's doing, and I'd rather she didn't try to play such complicated games and send inane texts like that in the future.

And also, for those that inevitably will say ""maybe get new roommates"": the lease is up in February. I have a few more months, moving is a complicated/difficult process and I don't want to start that any earlier than I absolutely need to.


Any advice or opinions on how to proceed forward, fellow Redditors, would be great.



tl;dr: One of three roommates that is supposed to be ""away"" is trying to split the electric bill despite her frequent visits. (Please see text transcript above). Advice and opinions are desperately needed to make sure that 1) i am not overreacting and that this is pretty crazy, and 2) i can proceed forward in a manner that ensures i don't get ripped off, can call out this behavior, and not completely ruin the last few months i have left.



***EDIT/UPDATE***: Solved! Thanks to all of you lovely people I was able to put together a coherent, respectful response in which I explained how monthly bills work. All of us travel and don't receive discounts for it, so this should be no different especially with her frequent visits. I told her I would pay the amount she asked this month, but going forward, would only be paying my portion going forward. 

She said she agreed & would pay her equal share, venmo'd back the difference she owed, and mentioned in the same breath that she's coming back to visit for another few days this weekend. So. That's as good as it's gonna get, folks. I'll take it. "
"My father's (M65) partner (F55) wants a relationship but I (F29) do not.


I'll try to provide a bit of background on us as people before I jump in.

**Me:** Shy, introverted, socially awkward, solitary.

**Dad's partner of 8 years:** We'll call her Sarah. She's very opinionated, strong-headed, extroverted and very family-oriented.

**My dad:** a quiet, socially-awkward introvert like me.

My mom and dad got divorced about 9 years ago and my dad started dating Sarah shortly after. I was 20 and living at home at the time attending university. When they first got divorced, my dad lived with me in our family home and he was incredibly depressed. He would drink and watch porn all night and stay in his room. I barely saw him. I didn't really know how to react as a young adult, I did my best to ask him if he was okay, talk to him and made food and all that. When he got with Sarah, he slowly got out of his funk.

When I first met Sarah, I thought she was perfectly fine and did my best to be polite. She was a stranger dating my dad, I didn't dislike her or anything, she was just a new random person who hung around the house sometimes now. 

Without really coming out and telling me directly - I heard through my dad - that she was disappointed that I didn't form a relationship with her. I thought it was kind of odd, was I supposed to be BFFs with this lady? And it's hard for me to be open with my friends, let alone older women who I don't know.

She has a bunch of kids my age or older who live in different cities and she keeps in touch with them and visits them frequently.

Anyway... this was 8 years ago, I don't remember the details, but Sarah had a blowout. It started when my car broke down and I had to get to work, so I asked Sarah if I could borrow her car. She let me, I thanked her, and went to work and came back. No biggie.

Well, apparently she thought that I DID NOT thank her (I'm 99% sure I did...) and that led to the blowout. She wrote me a big long Facebook message accusing me of being abusive to my father (what?!!), a bad person and slew of other things. 

I responded, refuting her claims. I don't remember the exact things either of us said, but I disagreed with her and told her my feelings too. Then she promptly blocked me on Facebook.

I remained blocked from her Facebook until about a year ago. 

Since the blowout, I've been cordial with her and not really acknowledged the elephant in the room, for my dad's sake. For the most part, I've honestly just been pretending she doesn't exist when I don't absolutely have to see her. I don't want her in my life, and she's definitely given me the impression she doesn't want me in hers.

There have been a few times over the years where she and my dad have invited me and my fiance over for dinner, and we've gone most of the time. Sometimes we couldn't make it for various reasons. It was always awkward and I'd need to drag my fiance along because he obviously isn't a fan of how she's treated me either.

When we do have dinner with them, Sarah and I just pretend that everything is cool. I am polite. Socially awkward, sure, but polite. I thank her for the meal and try to talk with her and my dad.

Another thing to mention... she has snubbed me several times in public.

I went to my cousin's art show opening and Sarah was there without my dad. I literally walked up to her and said ""Hi Sarah!"" and she turned and walked the other way.

More recently, I went out for a pancake breakfast with a bunch of friends for my birthday. My dad and Sarah were there. So I walked over to say hello, I specifically said ""Hi Sarah!"" about 5 feet away from her, and she didn't acknowledge me at all - just stared down at her food.

So... this is how things have been for the past 8 years. When I see her in public, I expect her to snub me. They invite us over once and a while for dinner, sometimes we'll go and do our best to have a pleasant time. My dad comes over to visit me at my house at least a couple times a month and we try to go out for lunch or go see movies with each other regularly. I haven't invited Sarah over to my house once.

So that brings us to present day.

Just a couple days ago I went over to my dad's to fix his Netflix and drop off his wedding invitation. I hemmed and hawwed over inviting Sarah to the wedding and figured in the end that I should, for my dad's sake. So her name was on the invite.

So I went inside, handed over the invite, said hi to my dad and Sarah and did my tech troubleshooting.

I was getting ready to leave when she pulled me aside and told me we had to talk. Great...

It was an hour long ""talk"" (tyrade might be a better word?) and I left in tears.

It was basically a personal attack on my character shrouded under the guise of ""wanting to build a relationship with me"". She told me I was rude, uncaring and disrespectful. She said how hurt her and my father were when we didn't come to their dinners. She told me how hurt she was when I don't ask about her and her life. She kept bringing up the fact that her son's wife has cancer and how uncaring it was of me not to ask her about it (what?). 

She told me I was raised poorly. My dad, all the while, was sitting there silently (as he usually does) and agreeing with her. I couldn't believe it. My parents were fine parents! Yeah, I was kind of a spoiled only-child but I turned out fine. I have a loving fiance, a great group of friends, awesome job, a dog, a house... not to mention my fiance's family - all of them love me!

I've literally never had anyone else say anything like this to me. My fiance's family knows I'm shy, but they think I'm a very sweet person nonetheless.

After the attack, she switched gears and started going on about how she really wanted us to get to know each other and build a relationship. She didn't want to just go to my wedding for the sake of my dad, she wanted to be there because she's excited for me. She said she wants to go dress shopping with me.

The whole thing... was mind-boggling. I just sat there, nodding through my tears, unable to even process what the fuck she was saying. I agreed to work on our relationship, we hugged, I left.

It's now been a few days since that happened and well... the more I think about it, the angrier I feel. I don't WANT a relationship with her. I don't like her. She's been nothing but a bully to me. When I came home crying, my fiance was seething with anger. He wanted to go over there to talk to her but I stopped him. 

I really love my dad, and I know he really badly wants us to be friends but... fuck, she is making it hard.

She keeps telling me what a ""warm"" and ""caring"" person she is, but she certainly hasn't shown me. 

I'd be happy if I never had to see her again, honestly. But my dad... ugh. I don't want to lose him in the process.

What do I do? 

**TLDR:** Dad's ""loving and caring"" partner is trying to build a relationship with me by attacking my shy personality and snubbing me."
"My [26F] husband [26M] of three years wants me to have a surgery I'm not totally sure about having


January of this year, I found out that I was a carrier of the BRAC1 gene. This did not surprise me as a vast majority of women on my father's side have gotten breast cancer. I have a history of cancer on both sides of my family, and it's been a mix of genetics and lifestyle choices. Seeing people very close to me die or fight a very difficult battle has encouraged me to try and stay as healthy as I can, and take any precautions to avoid getting cancer. I was told that I could have a preventative bilateral mastectomy and it sounded like a good idea.

I spoke to my husband about it and he told me that he wanted me to do anything I could do to protect myself, he would love and support me through it. So I had the procedure done. I noticed that I was surprisingly apathetic to losing my breasts, often being unable to relate to other women who felt ""maimed"" or like they were less of a woman. It felt weird not having my breasts there anymore but I wasn't particularly happy or sad.

I recently spoke to my doctor and she mentioned that I could get breast reconstruction, if I would like one. I was, again, pretty apathetic and said I might consider it. I passed along the idea to my husband in a conversation, not really going too much into it. He asked me if I was thinking of getting the reconstruction, I told him that I didn't put much thought into it. We started talking about something else then.

About a week ago, my husband abruptly told me that he would prefer if I got the surgery but understands if I don't want to. I asked him why; he said in bed and in terms of intimacy, he really misses them. He also said that it's taken a while to get used to my new body. This surprised me as he never even hinted at this before and actually seemed very accepting and loving of my body without my breasts.

I didn't know how to process this information at first. Now that I know what I do, I have been seriously contemplating getting the procedure done. I don't really know if I personally want to. I honestly think I could live without breasts. However, my husband has been very supportive of me. Not only in this journey, but also with my getting a PhD and pursuing my career. I'm wondering if I should take one for the team and the sake of my marriage. Admittedly, the surgery would make my now flat torso proportional to the rest of my curvy body which my husband would probably enjoy as well. I appreciate him staying, still being intimate me, and still trying to make me feel beautiful and desirable even if I had a body he seemed to have found less attractive.

I didn't think that this time a week ago I'd be thinking so much about this, but for the happiness of my spouse, would it be worth it? I'm trying to think objectively without my own personal biases.
  ---   
 **TL;DR; I had a bilateral mastectomy in January as a preventative measure against breast cancer and my husband has only recently told me that he misses my breasts and wants me to have breast reconstruction. I don't know if I want to, but wonder if I should for him.**"
"I think my 31/F fiancee is cheating on me 32/M.


I strongly suspect now and i'm horrified of the implications. We're getting married in September, I have a daughter with her. I don't know what I'll do without her.

I've been dating her since my final year of college. We have a child together a few years back and moved in together. I wanted to marry her when the time was right. 

I started suspecting she was cheating when left her phone with me on accident. I was prepping to bring it back to her when I saw a text from a guy named ""Rob"". I thought it was strange as I know all her friends and I know of nobody named Rob.  I didn't snoop. A couple hours later she gets a call from Rob. Twice he calls. I shrug this off and don't press the issue. I don't snoop.

Well, last friday I was home with my daughter. I was off for the day and going to surprise her at work with lunch. I head towards her work place and find out she never showed up. Panic begins to set in and i call her phone. No answer. I start thinking the worst has happened. I stop off at the store to get some fresh diapers and across the street who do i see? My fiancee with another man.

Alarms went off; 1. She's supposed to be at work. 2. Who the hell is this dude she's dressed up for and looks like she's on a date? 3. Why is she with him at our favorite restaurant to go on dates? The same place I proposed to her.

I'm in my car and can see her laughing and chatting. I want to do a test. I call her cell and she picks up and rushes towards a better location. She picks up the phone and seems agitated. She doesn't seem to want to chat and says she's really busy and can't talk. I tell her I made her lunch but, she says she already is going to get something at work and she's really busy and will be out late. She heads back. I leave feeling rejected.

I didn't confront her that night. I couldn't bare too do so. But, I know somethings going on now my friend said she saw her with another guy holding hands. She asked me about that. Also I've noticed how she doesn't get into our RPs anymore or want to have sex. She always has an excuse. She's been cold to me lately.But then when I mention the wedding she gets happy and excited. I can't figure out why she's having such bizarre mood swings.

Why? Why would she do so? Our sex life could be better sure but, I got a new promotion and a nice pay raise with it. We have a family now. We're talking about moving into a home and maybe even having another child. Her career is growing too. Life is excellent for us. Why? Why would she do this to me? What reason could she have?

"My parents drove drunk with my little sister and her four friends in the car.


My parents are alcoholics. Both have driven a car while intoxicated before, even with my siblings and me in the car. I have told them before how uncomfortable this makes me and how unsafe this is, and they always say something like, ""I know it's bad, we'll stop."" They still keep doing it. 


My 13 year old sister told me today that when my parents picked her and her friends up from the fair a couple days ago, both of my parents were drunk.
My dad was in the drivers seat. My sister explained that he swerved around the road and would break randomly. She kept telling them how unsafe she and her friends felt, but my mom just told her to shut up. During this time my mom tried to take the wheel with the intention to help my dad drive, and he hit her.


I don't know what to do anymore and I am scared for their safety and the safely of my siblings.


Tl;dr
My parents drove drunk with my sister and her friends in the car.

Edit: I am 16 and female, and I have my license. I will gladly drive my sister if my parents are drunk. The only problem with that is I don't have my own car so I won't always be able to.

 I have a 20 year old sister that has been staying with us for the summer but she goes back to college in the fall. She knows about all of this and was the first person to come to the conclusion that our parents are alcoholics a few years ago. I often mention calling the police or CPS but she disagrees with me saying, ""You want to lose our parents? You want to be put in foster care?"" So unfortunately she may not be of any help. I have no problem going behind her back to call the police and that is what I'll do next time my parents drive drunk."
"Me (31 f married), my parents r acting weird after me getting pregnant


I have been in a relationship for more than 7 years and married for more than 3 years. As I was a single child my parents were always a bit overprotective about me. But after I got pregnant recently they started acting very weird. First of they told this is the only child I need (that is if I am adamant in having a child), and I explained politely its not their business. But they are acting weird day by day.

I am having several health issues and struggling throughout pregnancy, but they are not at all supportive, simplifying my issues and they do not even ask about the health of the baby when we talk. Its like they are trying to avoid the baby from the talk.

When I talk about the baby they reply weirdly and act as if they are a jealous couple, implying that their baby was superior or something. I tell them I am that baby they are talking about, and how can my baby be any inferior to theirs.

It is very difficult to explain their behavior, every time they shuts me down, and I get depressed after talking to them every time. Even if I am happy they will find some way to kill that happiness. They have repeatedly told me many times that my baby will not be any good and I better expect the worse. I dont know what that means and how to react to it.

My husband is very loving and supporting, he had started considering my parents as bullies nowadays. If he tries to tell them to behave a little better and show me a little care they yell at him and gets very angry. As I am the only child I feel obligated to check upon them and care about them. But I cannot take this torture they are giving me anymore. What do I do?

"[Update] My (27F) mother (57F) is cutting me off from her side of the family over a tattoo


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mxqw4/my_27f_mother_57f_is_cutting_me_off_from_her_side/)
  

So it's been a month since this happened. Since then, I haven't been in contact with my mother much. I've had the whole ""my decisions aren't done to intentionally disrespect/hurt you"" etc etc after I got my first tattoo over a year and a half ago. Nothing helped but time, so my strategy this time was to just wait it out. 

I've called her three times this past month (just checking in on things) and each time she'll answer the phone with ""Oh, it's you. I don't want to talk to you"" or something like ""If you're trying to reach your father, call his cell"" instead of like....handing him the house phone (no cell service in the house). I just respond with ""Oh well, I just wanted to let you know about XYZ but just call me back if you're ever ready to talk"" and I get nothing. 

Meanwhile, I'm still trying to plan this trip. Most hotels are mostly booked and everything is running smoothly. I reach out to my aunt (mom's sister in Japan) through a messaging app we all use just saying ""Hey! As you know, my Japan trip is coming up soon. I'll be in your city these days, do you have any hotel recommendations for the area? I'm looking forward to seeing everyone and just let me know if you'd like to meet up on a certain day. Thanks etc etc"". I really tried not to be imposing and just opening the lines of communication with a simple hotel recommendation. She already knows about my trip (any my tattoos), since I hosted her daughter (my cousin) during her America trip back in March.

This was three days ago. I know my aunt is very active on social media, but I haven't gotten a response. Yesterday, both my sister and my father call me (pretty unusual) about my mom. They're concerned she's having some sort of mental breakdown or something and that I'm ruining our relationship by ""ignoring"" her and that this cold shoulder treatment isn't helping anybody (WHAT?!). My father in particular mentioned she has been much more upset about the issue in the last couple days, which would coincide with when I reached out to my Aunt. 

My sister mentioned that my mom was really upset when they spoke a few weeks ago, but it hasn't been brought up since. My sister said she convinced my mom that cutting ties between her family and I was a terrible decision.....but I am concerned my mother did so anyways after she found out I talked to my aunt. 

My father urged me to call my mom and ask how she's doing. He advised me to not take things so personally and not ""take the bait"". My sister also asked if I would be willing to sit down with her and my mom and talk about things, or even seek family counseling. 

My biggest issue is that: I don't have a problem with my mom personally. My biggest issue is that when she gets upset about something, she gets really really abusive. Not just about the tattoo, about my job/boyfriend/career/moving to a different city. She threatens cutting ties and threatens pretty much everything under the sun she has control over (which isn't much anymore compared to when I was a teenager). Before the tattoo, she'll remark how I can't see her family because I'm too fat, or too disrespectful, or that my Japanese isn't good enough, or that my boyfriend is too American. I am just so sick of it. I am not willing to put myself out there again. From my point of view, I am the only one that loses or risks anything by reaching out. I am expected to extend this olive branch time and time again meanwhile, she takes everything out on me.

My only sister has had a completely different relationship with my parents. She has never had this kind of treatment since she was a young teenager. Neither of us have any idea why my mom is so quick to be angry at me and hurl these abuses. It's really an entirely different side to her. I cannot just ""brush it off"" or ignore it. It gets to me. I try to forget everything she's said but bottom line is, it keeps me up. It fuels my anxiety and it reinforces all my doubt and anger and depression. I am distancing myself more out of self preservation than anything else. If I can just ignore everything until she forgets in a few more months, or I can put myself through hell for the slim chance that it'll make a difference. 

I just don't know what to do. I have other shit in my life to deal with and NOT dealing with her tantrums is honestly a huge relief to me in this past month. She knows, my family knows if she ever 1) picks up the phone and 2) isn't a huge bitch, then I am more than willing to talk to her. I feel like all this aggression and negativity is from her end but my immediate family is making it my responsibility. 

I don't know why my mom says the things she does. I am not her therapist and I'm not equipped to become her therapist. My family doesn't know 1/10 of the things she's done or said to me. If I do sit down with them I have no idea what to talk about or how to resolve the issue. I know I'm being selfish and petty by not reaching out to her more.....but on the other hand I've been so hurt over something that isn't my fault. I have been nothing but a good kid my whole life and the discrepancy between how I'm treated vs my sister makes this whole thing a LOT harder to swallow.

  **tl;dr**: My mom is reacting worse than I originally thought and may have already started cutting ties. Do I try to be the bigger person at the expense of my mental well being or do I take the low road and hide until this is all over. "

"[UPDATE] My (17F) boyfriend (16F) of a year kicked me out of anger.


First off: My original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66qbq6/my_17f_boyfriend_16f_of_a_year_kicked_me_out_of/) didn't gain much traction, and I was going to post here for advice on moving on anyway. As the two events are strongly related, I have decided to just include this as an update. Many thanks to everybody who commented on my OP and gave me advice. You were all right, and I was too naive, in love and in denial to see it. Thank you especially to u/roflllobster, who's post assisted me now in working up the courage to end it.

After 3 months of torment, and my confidence and mental health being the slave of my relationship, I have ended it. Do I still love him? Of course. He was my first love and he helped me through a lot of shit (which has unfortunately returned due to his anger issues and general mistreatment of me). I now have therapy, so I'm not dependent on him for the healing of my mental health and I have gained the love and trust of old friends who I neglected for him just a year ago. I have seen the errors in the way he treated me.

When confronted about his disrespect and negative behaviour towards me, it would be my fault, because it isn't his fault that I'm a pussy (yep, he said that to me). He said he feels like he's ""treading on eggshells"" when talking to me. He also said that talking to me is annoying, and that he has more fun without me. Then 30 or so minutes later he would come back apologising and telling me he loves me and that I'm amazing. I've been called a bitch, I've been kicked and grabbed by him. I feel so disrespected, and my therapist said it definitely sounds like I blame myself for his disrespect because he makes me feel as though I'm too sensitive.

Despite realising my self worth, and having all the friends in the world to help me through this, I still crave his affection. He was my best friend, I love him so much. It's been a few hours and I can't process things properly. I need advice on how to make it through the next week without my best friend. I want to hug him, kiss him, I miss him so much. I don't know what to do. We would talk until one of us fell asleep every night, we played games together, and we did everything together.

Please help me reddit. I've never experienced anything like this before. I feel like crying all the time, why am I so upset when I've been treated so badly?

Tl;dr: Left an abusive (??) boyfriend. Struggling to cope being without someone who I considered my best friend. Need advice on how to survive the next week or so without him."

"My best friend [21 F] stole my [22 F] vibrator


I have been best friends with *Tara since the first day of first grade. We have been like sisters since despite the fact that I now live out of state. 

I am currently home for the summer and probably my second week here I lost my vibrator. At first I just assumed it was under the bed or hiding in a drawer but tore my entire room apart and found it nowhere. As you can imagine, it was incredibly frustrating.

A few nights later I'm at her place sleeping over. I go to her dresser to borrow a tshirt (per her instruction) and open the top drawer to see it lying there, placed top of hers. This is by no means a fancy vibrator, it was $15 from a store that exists only in my state. I was in such disbelief that I doubted it myself for a few days. But I know what I saw and I know she has it. 

I have no idea why she would steal something like that from me. She already has one and that is such a personal item to take from someone. Especially from someone who has been your support system your entire life. 

She has always been very strange about sexuality, she and I got in a big argument once when she said that gay people creeped her out. A mutual friend of ours came out to her and all she did was scooch farther away on the couch. 

She never talks about her feelings and is very guarded and can be very cold and competitive. She is also very territorial over me, I recently took her to a party and anytime I would talk to someone she would come up like a pissed off boyfriend with her arms crossed and tell me to come take a shot with her or something. She wanted to go an hour in and when I told her I wasn't ready she went and ordered herself an uber and left without telling me.

She also sleeps with hundreds of guys. Not that there is anything wrong with sleeping with all of the people that you want but it is destructive the way that she goes about it. She recently slept with 3 guys in one day and didnt make any of them use a condom. She has been in 2 serious relationships and has cheated with many partners the entire way through. 

I stupidly texted her the other night and said ""I know this is super weird but I lost my vibrator and I thought I saw it in your room do you have it?"" the next morning she replied with a simple ""no""

Our other mutual best friend told her that I had lost it and instead of saying ""maybe its here, maybe its there"" she replied with ""Well she needs to buy a new one then."" Like she knew I wasn't going to find it. 

I love her very much and I'm not angry with her, I just want to know whats going on. Is it some kind of power play? Does she have feelings for me? Is she just being a klepto? It's difficult for me to hang out with her right now because I know that she did that and I feel weird. I'm worried and I don't know what to do especially since I have no idea how to get her to genuinely talk to me about it.

  **tl;dr**: Best friend since first grade stole my cheap vibrator. Denies taking it but I saw it in her room. I'm just genuinely worried about her and feel weird continuing like normal knowing she did that.

"I showed my friend (f/23) a picture of my mom and younger sister. The comment she made about my looks (f/22) afterwards kind of hurt my feelings


We are not close friends. I feel like we're only friends because we have the same class schedule. We don't even follow each other on social media.

So the other day during our break I showed her pictures from my aunt's wedding that was over the weekend. She gasped once she's seen my mom and younger sister. She looked at me with pity then said ""omg your mom is so beautiful why weren't you born beautiful just like her. And your sister obviously won the big lottery that is your mom's beauty"" 

Her comment really hurt my feelings. I was so happy about my hair and makeup, and mostly my dress, my aunt chose me to be her bridesmaid. I felt like a princess that day and now I feel sad after her comments. To think that I was wandering around the venue that day thinking that I was beautiful when I was easily overshadowed by my mom and sister is sad. I'm not shallow and I am always aware that my mom and sister are prettier than me, but I never thought it was something that someone would consider is worth mentioning or even thinking of. So it never bothered me. I am actually so proud of how beautiful they are. Its like they're my little kittens and I want to make sure that everyone knows how cute they are.

But I never saw a family and thought to myself that one is prettier than the other. I just think that people are beautiful without comparing them to their siblings, family, friends, etc. Now I can't stop thinking that it must be so obvious that people feel sorry for me being the ugliest one of them.

Am I overreacting? I feel so bad for feeling this way. It might have been a joke what she said, but its not like we're close friends. We're just classmates.


tldr: showed my friend a picture of my mom and sister from my aunt's wedding over the weekend and she said  ""omg your mom is so beautiful why weren't you born beautiful just like her. And your sister obviously won the big lottery that is your mom's beauty"" I feel sad because although I am aware of how beautiful my mom and sister are compared to me, I just never thought it was noticeable, or at least I never thought people would think it to themselves or even say it. I was a bridesmaid that day so I felt so good about myself, but now I feel ashamed, I feel like everyone at the wedding was thinking to themselves that my mom and sister are prettier than me, and that I'm a joke for feeling beautiful. I am always proud of my mom and sister and how beautiful they are, its like they're my little kittens and I want to make sure that everyone knows how cute they are."

"My [29/f] new boss [49/m] has reignited my rampant daddy issues.


I am 29/f. Boss is 45/m. I have been working for him for 6 months now. 

In short - I adore him. He can do no wrong in my eyes. I have not said anything to him or any other coworkers and I have no intention of doing so. 

I was abused as a child, and I just want him to take care of me and protect me. I also have sexual feelings for him which really confuses me as he is in no way attractive. I am maybe a 7 or an 8, but I feel like a dipstick saying that. 

It's made me a million times more productive as I want to work hard for him. I've turned around a big project very quickly recently which if it finishes on time will make my organisation look very good, and obviously he gets credit for that too, so at the moment I feel as if we have a very positive working relationship. He pushes me hard, but it's in a very positive way. My coworkers call me the golden girl and tell me I'm his favourite. 

However i recognise this isn't exactly the most healthy way of working. I've had therapy in the past but a) it's expensive and b) I'm actually in a fairly good place right now. I'm also really worried he knows and that I'll come off as unprofessional or like a child. People who have worked with him previously have warned me that he knows how to play people and can read them well. They've also warned me he's a bully but he's always been really 'soft' with me, for want of a better word. 

I wondered if anyone could give me advice on how to proceed? 

Edit: there is definitely no intention here for me to fuck my boss. I'm primarily concerned with my feelings and how inconvenient they are. 
 
Tl:dr: I'm increasingly focusing on my Male boss due to my psychological issues. It's not all bad but I do think it's unhealthy!"
"This shouldn't bother me anymore, but I (22F) am the 'ugly friend' and it's getting me down


So I just moved to a new city to start graduate school. My cohort is a group of 9 other girls who are really nice and I love hanging out with them. There was a welcome mixer for us and some of the other graduate students at the school, with an open bar and dancing and stuff. I went along with them and on the whole, I had a good time.

What gets me under my skin though is the fact that I'm the ugly friend. If some guy from another program walked over to us and we'd all introduce ourselves, the guy would just skip over me. This happened multiple times! Several of them didn't even look at me or bother to remember my name, even though they made the effort with all the other girls in my group.

Additionally, I just feel ugly compared to the rest of them. Prior to grad school most of my friends were guys, so I didn't compare myself appearance-wise to them. I'm a bit heavier than all the other girls in the group, I wear large glasses, and I have short hair. I personally enjoy my personal style. I realize all these things are turn-offs to men, but I always considered myself not ugly and at the very least worthy of being treated like a person!

The thing is, this shouldn't bother me anymore. I'm in a happy relationship of 4 years. But I guess I feel a bit attention starved these days because my BF started a new job, is tired all the time, and doesn't really notice me physically anymore, since we now live together. I don't feel hot. I feel like a troll.

How can I get over being 'the ugly friend'? I really like these girls and want to continue hanging out with them! But I don't want to have this lingering resentment for my situation.

"My (34M) niece (11F) has started asking questions about why her dad/my brother (35F) left and divorced her mom (35F) and I don't know what to tell her


I am completely in over my head on this. And I have no idea what to tell her. My (34M) niece's (11F) dad is my older brother (35M). He left my niece's mom (35F) after my niece turned 1 and divorced her, and my niece has started asking me questions about it and why my brother left.

My niece's mom was born with a liver condition and a heart condition. Pregnancy was a nightmare for her. I mean my niece was loved and wanted but her mom did not enjoy pregnancy. She barely gained any weight because she was always sick, she had kidney stones and heartburn and went weeks without sleeping because of how miserable it was. She spent most of the pregnancy in the hospital. Due to her heart condition she was going to have a planned c-section because a regular birth would have meant likely death for her and the baby. She ended up going into labor 23 days before her planned c-section. Thankfully she was in the hospital so they could do an emergency c-section because she had already started going into distress from the natural labor. Thankfully they got the c-section done, my niece was born healthy and okay and her mom recovered fully.

After that her mom decided she never wanted to be pregnant again. Her doctors recommended the same thing. Since she could not take any form of hormonal control or IUD due to her liver condition, the doctors recommended a tubal. My brother initially was supportive. But not long after he started getting upset because he always imagined himself with a big family with many children. Surrogacy or adoption was not affordable for them and even though my brother acknowledged how terrible the pregnancy was and what the doctor's all recommended, he was still upset. He ended up leaving and filing for divorce just after my niece turned one because he said he couldn't imagine not having more kids. His wife was told her pregnancy would be medium to high risk her whole life but until she actually got pregnant the doctors said no one would know how bad it was. No one blames her for not wanting to get pregnant again.

He married a different woman a month after the divorce was final. At the time she had a 3 year old, a 2 year old and 1 year old twins. He adopted all her kids and they planned to have more. But karma kicked him because he found out he was infertile. But he is still married to that woman and is father to her kids. He barely talks to our family and never comes to any family events or holidays because he is always with her, her family and their kids. The only time any of us had met them was at the wedding. He occasionally calls my parents and for the most past that it is. He sees his daughter for 2 Sundays a month and didn't even try to get shared custody or visitation. He also didn't try to get ""decision"" type custody about things like where she goes to school and stuff. So he can't even pick her up from school or make any kind decision about her medical care. Meanwhile he does all this stuff for the kids he adopted. He doesn't see my niece on holidays or get her gifts for things like Christmas or her birthday. Her mom used to get stuff and say it was from her dad, and our family would help with that but my niece caught on and said she knew it was not really from him.

For the record I think my brother is a grade A asshole for divorcing his wife and leaving his wife and daughter, just to run off and make a new family with someone else. It would have been different if there were problems in the marriage or something but my brother told everyone and said in court it was only because he wanted more kids. I wouldn't even feel this way if he had not essentially abandoned my niece. He sees her for a few hours 2 Sundays a month but otherwise doesn't visit, see her on holidays, come to school events etc. He doesn't even bring her around the other kids he adopted and she has never met them before and has only seen his wife in passing and not met her.

My niece's mom is a great person. She still keeps in touch with my family, comes to holidays, family events and weddings sometimes and doesn't badmouth my brother. Even though he is barely around she encourages her daughter to spend time with him. We helped her out with babysitting and groceries when my niece was younger and there are no problems between her and our family. She considers herself part of our family still and vice versa. Her family has been good to us at events like my niece's birthday when everyone comes together. She has not remarried or had a boyfriend since my brother left but everyone would be happy for her if she decided to have one. My niece told me my brother actually told her that if her mom was going to marry a new guy he (my brother) would be okay with that guy adopting my niece. I don't even know what to say to that.

My niece and I both love sports so I'll take her to games or out to watch them or to play. We spend lots of time together. Lately she's been asking about her dad and why he left. I tried asking her what her mom says but my niece says her mom just says things didn't work out, but she knows there is more to it. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want to upset her even if my brother is an ass. I also don't want her to think her only worth is having kids and men won't want her if she doesn't want kids or can't have them. Also I don't want to scare her about her mom. Her mom isn't on medication and doesn't need any treatment or doctors appointments for her liver and heart besides once a year for a checkup. I don't want her to get the wrong idea and think her mom is sick or something just because the pregnancy was bad. I am also not sure about talking to her mom about it because I know it is a sore spot for her. It really hurt her when my brother left and she still hurts over it because she really loved him.

I have never been married and I don't have kids. I have a girlfriend where things are getting serious but I don't live with her yet. I have no idea what to tell my niece without making things bad or upsetting her or her mom. What should I do here?

**tl;dr** My brother left his wife when his daughter was 1 because his wife had a bad pregnancy and was told not to get pregnant again. He wanted more kids. He married a woman with 4 kids and adopted them but barely acknowledges my niece now. My niece is 11 and has started asking me about why her dad really left. I don't know what to tell her."

"My (36f) husband (36m) refuses to change how he speaks to me when he's stressed, and after 10 years of having the same argument every 3 months, should I cut my losses or stay for the inevitable repeat performance?


TL:DR - Had the ""please don't speak to me like I'm too stupid for words"" argument for the 241st time with my husband. Finally realized he's never changed how he speaks to me because he sees this as ""I'm sorry you got your feelings hurt,"" rather than, ""I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.""


Throwaway because he is also a Redditor, and he knows (and actively snoops on) my main account name. Also, apologies ahead of time for the upcoming vent.

It seems I'm married to a man who doesn't respect me. For the most part our marriage is fine but some issues just keep coming up after I think they've been worked on and dealt with, time and time again. As I mentioned in the title, my husband and I keep having the same argument about how badly he speaks to me when he's frustrated/annoyed/mildly put out. I mean, we've had this fight so often it's ridiculous. I've asked him many times over the years to be more thoughtful, but there's only so many ways I can explain that even though he may never use words like ""stupid"" and ""incompetent"", his tone and phrasing always imply exactly that. 

Today's argument went no differently but for one thing; while I was asking him if he would accept someone treating him the way he had just spoken to me, he pretended like I wasn't even speaking and just walked away. That was when I realized he has never seen anything wrong with the way he speaks to me. That all those times I'd angrily told him to rethink his wording, or cried because he'd hurt my feelings, his view on the situation was always that I was ""misinterpreting his intent"", never that his communication skills sucked dong. In his head these blow ups were me being unnecessarily mean to him.

My reaction was to take myself to the bathroom, have a cry, and pull my shit together. He never said one more word on it, just went about his afternoon like he didn't just see his wife walk past him with tears steaming down her face. I used to think he never verbally apologised after these particular blow ups because it made him uncomfortable, preferring to buy his way to forgiveness with treats and acts of kindness. Now I'm wondering if it's his way to protest being blamed for something he thinks is just me overreacting. Later this evening he even tried to make me feel bad for making him feel bad, so there's that too.

So finally the question! What the fuck should I do?? Is this a mild thing that I should just overlook because rest of the time things aren't bad, or should I go because what is happening is actually a form of verbal and emotional abuse?"
"[UPDATE] Do I (25/F) have unrealistic expectations for the post-honeymoon (4 months) with 27M?


[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pxa9i/do_i_25f_have_unrealistic_expectations_for_the/)

About two weeks ago, I made a post here regarding my four-month relationship with my boyfriend. I was not happy with how he was treating me. I felt like shit when we had sex, when I tried to talk to him, etc but I worried that my feelings were a result of thinking I needed to be treated like a Princess. I was worried that I would be ending a relationship with a decent guy who has flaws like everyone else because I was one of those women who wants a fairy tale romance. Shockingly, the replies I got were almost unanimously telling me “He sucks, Break up.”

Anyway, I did end up breaking up with him. I told him about the issues I had, and his response was to say “Sorry” in a very sarcastic voice and then “I don’t know what to say?” You would think I had told him I was breaking up with him because of the color of his car. I told him I don’t want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t respect me and doesn’t like me all that much. About an hour after I left his apartment, I got a text that said “I’m in shock. Are we really broken up?” 

I was very blind in the relationship, but I can see clearly now and I am thinking about other possibly asshole things he did. I remember one time, I told him that I had been doing really well with working out on a regular basis. His response: “I can’t tell a difference”. Me: “Well when I first measured my body fat, it was around 24% and now I’m down to 17% Body Fat…” Him: “If you insist” (BTW, there is clearly a visible difference in my stomach when you look at pictures...my stomach is very flat now!). Another time, I told him I was learning Python because it would be beneficial in my career. He told me it would be a waste, while also complaining that he doesn’t understand what I do for a living. Do I sound too sensitive? I just want someone who will encourage me when I am trying to better myself. 

Anyway, I realize now that it’s much better to be single than in a bad (would my relationship be considered bad? or just mediocre?) relationship.

tldr; I thought my expectations for a relationship were too high but I realized that my boyfriend was treating me very badly so I ended it with him.

"A girl I [21M] was seeing [20F] has just had a child and my mum [50F] liked a selfie of her and her son on FB. My girlfriend [22F] saw and is now really upset.


Is my girlfriend of a year acting irrationally and is she being super dramatic or am I in the wrong for not understanding? Basically, this girl I was seeing like FIVE years ago has just recently had a child and has been posting this on Facebook a lot as one does. She happens to be my cousin's best friend, and neither me nor my mum are friends with her on FB anymore; I'm assuming my mum only saw the pictures because my auntie and cousin liked them. 

My girlfriend went on this girl's page (idk why) and saw that my mum has been liking her pictures she's put up with her son even though she isn't friends with her. I've explained that she's only liked them because she's my cousin's good friend and when someone that young has a child news goes around, etc. It's not serious or a bad thing.

Well, girlfriend is now very worried and is assuming my mum likes this girl more than she likes her and wished I ended up with her instead. I don't even think my mum knows I was seeing her lol and I'm positive she only even liked the pictures because of my cousin and because she knows of her because she's her good friend. I mean I kind of understand why she's upset but I also think she's being really silly assuming my mum doesn't like her when she clearly does - she stays over at mine a lot so obviously my mum has to like her and I can just tell. She's also worried that me and my mum are now talking about this girl whenever she isn't here. 

She says she doesn't like it because she feels like I have an attachment to this girl (I haven't even talked to her in like 5 years so I definitely don't plus I've only ever had one real gf and it's my current gf and I love her to bits so???). I don't know how to convince her that the like meant nothing. Hopefully if you guys agree with me I can show her this post and the comments and she may realise how insecure she sounds.

Please give me some outside opinions, Reddit.

TLDR: I was seeing this girl 5 years ago and she's recently had a baby and has been posting pictures of her child on FB. This girl is a good friend of my cousin. My mum has been liking this girl's pictures of her son because she knows her through my cousin even though she hasn't got her added on there. She can only see the pictures because my cousin and auntie are liking them too so they appear on the homepage. My gf is worried my mum likes this girl and wishes I ended up with her instead? Please help."
