"Update: I [30F] found my friend's [30F] fiance's [30M] Tinder profile. They have been dating for 2-3 years and are are getting married in 30 days.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6fwlif/i_30f_found_my_friends_30f_fiances_30m_tinder/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)

After hanging out with Annie for four hours this weekend, I mustered up the courage to tell her about Finnick's Tinder profile. I told her that I didn't want her to think I was implying anything, but that if it were me, I would want to know, and I thought she would want to know, too.

She already knew. Not because they're in an open relationship, but because he had been having a three month texting ""affair"" with a girl last year. After that girl found out about Annie, she wrote Finnick a letter about how brokenhearted she was, then Finnick 'fessed up to Annie.

Annie said she doesn't really considering it cheating, and that's fine, because it's her relationship and so she and Finnick get to determine the dealbreakers.

I think she was a little concerned, though, because apparently he told her that he had deactivated/deleted his account, and that clearly didn't happen. She texted him when we were together and told him that someone else had found his profile. He apologized and swore that he didn't have the app downloaded but that he would go ahead and make sure his account is deactivated.

I don't know how many people were really looking for an update, but I did get helpful advice on my last post and I really appreciated everyone's input.

"The stranger (20s?M) who helped save my (25F) life might stalking me


Burner account just in case. 

I have found myself in an incredibly strange situation. I live in a large city in the United States, and take the subway/metro to work every day. A few weeks ago, I was finishing up my breakfast outside the train station, and a little piece of toast got stuck in my windpipe. I tried to cough it back up but I couldn't breathe, and started freaking out. I ran to the nearest people, two men in their 20s/30s, and made it clear I was choking. One of them had a water bottle and I was able to drink some and dislodge the piece of toast. The two men were very concerned and made sure I was okay before I left, which I appreciated very much. I thanked them profusely and went on my way to work. I thought I would be done with this whole situation, but then things got weird. 

A few days after the choking incident, I was walking home from the store and all of a sudden a man runs up to me to stop me. I realize it was one of the men who helped save me, and he introduced himself (let’s call him “John”). We started talking and I thanked him again. He then started telling me he’s been thinking about me every day and talking to me about religion and how he thinks God put me in his life. He then asked where I lived, to which I gave a very vague answer, and said “I’m not going to ask for your number right now, but I would like to get to know you.” I told him that I am in a relationship, but that didn’t really seem to sink in. I told him I had to go, and the conversation ended with him saying “I know I’ll see you again.” 

I saw him again the next morning. He was standing outside the subway/metro entrance I normally use (and where I choked). I realized it was him and tried to quickly go past him so he wouldn't recognize me…but once I was almost at the end of the escalator, I heard someone running down the steps. Sure enough, it was John. He had run all the way down the escalator to catch up with me, and he said “I’m glad I saw you again. I’ll always be here for you.” I was really shocked, and said something like “oh” before I turned and hurriedly walked to the train platform. 

After that incident, I started taking a different entrance to the train. I hadn’t seen him for a week…until I saw him again today. I was walking home from the store with my boyfriend, and all of a sudden I saw someone come up from behind my boyfriend. I realized it was John but acted like I didn’t see him, and kept focusing on talking to my boyfriend. John got weirdly close to my boyfriend and was staring at me, seeming like he was going to say something to me, but then he pulled back and my boyfriend and I walked away. After I told my boyfriend that it was John, we checked to make sure he wasn’t following us, and used the back entrance to our apartment. 

I am at a loss regarding what to do or what to think. I’m grateful to John and his friend for saving my life, but his behavior has become very inappropriate and weirdly threatening. From speaking with him, it’s clear that there’s not something quite “right” about him, and I have no idea if he would have violent tendencies if I were to tell him to leave me alone. I hate feeling so trapped, and RESENT that this is the reality of being a woman in this world (can’t I just have a near death experience and have it not turn into some stalking situation??!?!). How should I approach this? Should I confront him or tell him off? Is this the beginning of behavior/stalking that is more sinister? Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you. 
  
EDIT: I should have made this more clear, but I expressed my disinterest in him multiple times during the second encounter. When he said he wanted to get to know me, I told him that I wasn't interested, that I needed to get on with my life, and that I am in fact in a relationship. The other two encounters happened too quickly and caught me too off guard for me to say anything, and as many others have pointed out, there is always the question of safety when faced with a man who can't seem to take ""no"" for an answer. Thank you for all the words of advice and support; I really do appreciate it.

"Me (35F) with our office intern (22F). How do I politely let her know that her antics are inappropriate in an office setting?


Hello Reddit. Obvious throwaway because who knows if she's around.

I've acquired an intern for the summer. I've had little experience with interns, she was brought over as a favor granted to someone in a higher floor than I. Office politics, she's related to a Vice President of purchasing and they want her here all summer long. My boss said ok and handed her to me. 

My job is enough for one, but not for two, and there's only so much she can learn without doing. The databases and info I deal with is confidential, and cannot be accessed without a license and security clearance. So in short, there's not a whole lot to do. As a result of this issue, I am constantly asking others in our office for random jobs that she can do. Everyone has been great so far, but I really need help addressing some problems I've seen.

This girl has absolutely no boundaries. There is no respect given to anyone in the office, regardless of position, or seniority. 

She will announce to anyone that asks that she's here by request from the VP, and sees it as leverage over others. 

She's a terrible gossip. This girl knows more about the inner workings of the company than I do with nearly 12 years in. 

She's very personal with all of our staff, making inappropriate jokes and comments that offend many. I'm constantly apologizing for this girl.  

And lastly, small as it seems, I'm chained to this girl every day. Which means bathroom breaks are together, mealtimes are taken together...and she chews with her fucking mouth open and I can't stand it anymore. 

My direct supervisor has told me that there's nothing I can do, I'm going to have to do this until late July. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can make work easier for the next month and a half? How do I correct behavior gently so as to not anger the VP, her parent? 

Help, Reddit. I'm slowly going mad. I've recently come back from maternity leave and the extra stress combined with new motherhood is leaving me a little overwhelmed. 

Tl;dr: I have an intern that has no social skills or manners and is related to a bigwig in the office. I need help and advice on how to cope and correct behaviors. "

Boy, where do I start with all this... I suppose I should mention that my family is quite broken due to a highly abusive dad, so none of us would be considered ""normal"". Some of my family members may sound pretty messed up, but everyone is doing the best they can to get better so please don't judge too hard. Also, this is going to be long... sorry!

Anyway, I graduated from college about a year ago and started an office job in August. Everyone else in my family lives 7 hours away in a tiny town, and while they have some coursework at a community college, none are close to materializing it into a career. I am the only one who has managed to ""escape"" our small home. Part of their stagnation has something to do with lack of direction combined with my mother's highly protective nature. To this day she tells me how I wouldn't have made it through school without my long term boyfriend by my side, and she is extremely protective of my siblings. It's like she has empty nest syndrome even though her nest is still mostly full.

Several months ago I had offered to host my siblings for a week or two so they could get a taste of the city. We were raised in poverty in rural areas, so experiencing a piece of my life with comfortable income and thousands of people could be a great experience. Additionally, they could get a taste of independence for the very first time, and perhaps that would motivate them to move out.

Although I made this offer about 10 months ago, one of my brothers spontaneously decided to visit this week. Everything has been going well so far; I've taken a very hands-off approach with him, and he's learning some things the hard way. My mother would be appalled at the lack of planning and the number of his mistakes (like attempting to drive downtown during rush hour and being stuck for hours, LOL) but I think it's a great learning opportunity. Unfortunately I guess my mom did too because we were chatting on the phone and she asked if I would be willing to rent an extra room so my sisters could stay with me. She offered to pay their portion of rent and said they wouldn't have to live with me full time, but they would be free to come and go whenever they felt like staying.

Don't get me wrong, I care deeply about my sisters. However, both are very immature for their ages and unable to keep jobs--in fact, one has never even tried in her entire life. Neither have local friends, instead opting to do the bulk of their socializing online. The older (whom we'll call Jessica) does have some mental disabilities that make day-to-day social interactions tough, and my other sister (Katy) likely does as well. The pressure of full time school or work is overwhelming to them, and both lack the ""social crisco"" needed to get through a day of dealing with people. I can't count the number of times I have been told, ""Hey, your sisters are weird,"" or, ""what's wrong with your sisters?"" When I visit home, it's painful to take them places. My mother can't bear spontaneity of any sort; it's so bad that grocery trips are scheduled once every two weeks and that is literally the only time she goes out. Jessica and Katy have adopted this mindset, although they are somewhat more worldly; they also participate in my town's art walk... to make a dinner of the free snacks. On a visit home one time, I was trying to cook a special meal and realized we were missing a key ingredient. I asked Katy and Jessica to run to the grocery store three blocks away and pick up the $5 item, and they were stunned. Not only was it an extremely short notice request, but they didn't understand why they should have to pay for it (even though the entire meal for 6 was coming out of my pocket). Don't get me started on how they have no financial obligations. Neither has to pay a single cent towards their living expenses, nor do they have a concept of working to earn a living. 

Clearly Jessica and Katy are not prepared to enter the real world as adults. I realize they have some extra struggles that make life harder, but they are still ridiculously immature. What's worse is that my mom somehow thinks the opposite. She was explaining that Katy doesn't need a job because Katy has dreams of making a living off a web comic she has been developing on and off for a few years. In fact, mom wants to send Katy to art school because she's so mature and getting great grades in community college. For reference, Katy is taking one class at a time and has been at CC for over four years now. I don't know what planet my mom is from, but I just can't see the logic in that. Jessica is even worse; she has been on a streak of blaming the world for discriminating against her in various ways. While some of this is actually true, she blames ALL of her problems on external reasons and uses it as an excuse not to work on self improvement. Furthermore, she is extraordinarily dependent on others for the most mundane things. Jessica wished to attend an anime convention a few hours north of my city. However, she was scared of being kidnapped on public transit or getting lost, so she expected me to drive home (7 hrs), drive her to the convention (11 hrs), get her a hotel room for the weekend, and drive her back home (another 11 hrs). Her justification for this? I have a car.

Obviously my sisters need all the help they can get. I know that I offered to host them a couple months ago, but things have changed since then. My bf and I actually wanted to get a smaller apartment that we could hang onto for more than one lease cycle. If my sisters came to stay, I would have to sleep in separate bedrooms than my bf (uber catholic upbringing and pre-marital sex do not mix). It took me a while, but I've made friends and picked up hobbies that keep me out of the house most nights of the week. With Jessica and Katy staying with me, I feel that I'd have to sacrifice some of that in order to babysit them. During our broken childhood, it often fell on my shoulders to watch the younger kids. Even after we escaped that situation in my teens, I was still the chaperone for any events outside of the house. Now I am finally free of those burdens, and for the first time in my life I'm thriving. I feel so extremely selfish, but I really don't want to become Mom 2.0 for Jessica and Katy. Mom is head over heals thrilled with the idea and sees it as their golden ticket to a better life. The worst part is I know she's right. I could save Jessica and Katy so much time and trouble by teaching them how to live and sharing my situation with them. They would get a huge kick out of my nerdy hobbies (DnD, cosplay, SCA and etc) and it would give them exposure to friends. I know it would be a dream come true for them, but they would not be coming to me as roommates; they'd be coming as overgrown kids.

I really don't know what to do. It doesn't seem fair to hoard my success, but at the same time I worked my ass off to get my degree and this job. I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor without being weighed down. Advice?

"Update to: My brother [34m] didn't make me [26m] his best man.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qfs1h/my_brother_34m_didnt_make_me_26m_his_best_man/

TLDR of the original thread: ""My brother picked his best friend to be his best man instead of me to be his best man. I'm grateful he did this, but my family is fighting him on it for seemingly no reason.""

Hi everyone, and thanks for the help you offered in my original post. My Brother married his wife yesterday, and things went well.

There seemed to be a bit of confusion in one of the comments, so I want to say again, I'm glad my brother picked the person he did to be his best man, I am honoured to be one of his groomsman, and I am completely on his side in this whole thing.

So the main take away I got from my original thread I got was that I should be the person to shut our parents down when they throw a hissy fit over the fact that I'm not my brother's best man.

Quite simply, I did what I could. As I now live in a different city to my family, I'm sure that I was not present for many of the fights my brother had to endure. When I visited my former hometown, I saw what they had to say, but I can only imagine that he's had to take more crap that I ever saw.

After the comments in my original thread, I phoned my brother to make it clear that I was 100% on his side in this, and that while we're not exactly close as friends, I'm honoured to be a groomsman for him, and this I thought that he made a great choice as his choice for best man. I also let him know that f any one at all were to throw crap at him for his choice of groomsmen, he can defer them to me, and I'll handle the fallout. That his choice for his side of the bridal party should not cast a shadow on their day. I never got a call, but my brother isn't someone to deflect conflict. At this point , I wasn't sure if anything more was said.

Once I traveled out for the rehearsal and wedding, I finally found out his groomsmen order. I was number 2, immediately behind his best man. Things went well, and we were all ready for the wedding.

The wedding went well, and my brother's best friend did a great job as best man (the bachelor party and speech were legendary, haha.) I could have never done what he did. As our Parents gave their speech, we both felt there was a bit of shade thrown his way. Nothing in the sense of ""We're all mad that he abandonded his family and picked a friend as his best man,"" More along the lines of ""Family in incredibly important, and no friendship can ever be more important than your family.""

I spoke to them that it was obvious to us what they were talking about, and it was kind of obvious that they were still at least a bit upset. I had to tell the again that I would have been a terrible best man, and would have turned it down if he'd offered it to me.

At the end of the day, my brother's ad sister in law's wedding went well. I proudly stood behind my brother and his best friend, and while my parents threw some shade at the wedding, they didn't ruin it.

Fun P.S. to the story: A kind redditor in my original post suggested that I could offer a reading during the ceremony or  speech during the reception. I didn't respond to it, so I'll take that opportunity now: If I'd asked, I have no doubt that my brother would have given me the moment to give a speech or reading. However, as I said, I'm a terrible public speaker, to the degree that I'm the type to pass out at the podium. Despite that, and without knowing of my original thread, his best man made a joke that I was going to make an impromptu speech during the reception. I shut that down pretty quick, just in case, but we all had a good laugh over it.

"Me [27 F] with my boyfriend [37 M] of 6 months, he has a coworker [25 F] who makes sexual comments to him, enough that his employees seem to think they have a ""thing"", and I can't get him to understand why it bothers me that he hasn't set boundaries with her


My boyfriend Ron (37 M) and I (27 F) have been dating for about 6 months. He's a manager at the company we both work for, but we work in different departments. I want to start this off by saying I don't believe he has ever cheated on me or that he ever would cheat on me. He has never given me any reason to doubt him. I think the issue here is really with his ability to set boundaries with female coworkers who act inappropriately toward him and I can't figure out how to get him to understand that. And maybe I'm being a little too over-worried about it, but I'd like some feedback on the whole situation from you guys.

So I guess the first thing that happened that made me kind of disconcerted was about 2 months ago or so. There is a woman in my department named Denise (40s? F) who is generally the type of person to start trouble. She likes to talk about people behind their backs and try her best to underhandedly make you feel insecure (think Regina George from Mean Girls, but 40 years old). Denise started to flirt with Ron when I was around (and I guess possibly when I wasn't around but I never heard anything about it). Very small things, like excitedly yelling out his name when he came in the room or being overly giggly or touchy around him. These things are very innocuous on their own, but Denise is *nothing* like this around other male coworkers, or even female coworkers. I guess that's what stuck out to me, the fact that it was over the top for her and just different than her normal behavior. Ron definitely didn't flirt back, he was just friendly and professional to her.

I never said anything about it to Ron (although I was thinking about saying something if she kept doing it) because her behavior was so mild and didn't really bother me. I guess I just kind of took note of it and thought, ""Hmm, does he not realize she's flirting? Is that why he's not shutting it down, even in a polite way? I guess Denise is just trying to cause drama and make me jealous"". And she did eventually stop after a few weeks, most likely because I didn't react to it.

The situation that caused me to write this post happened today. Ron is about to go visit his parents for a week so we were hanging out at my house before he had to leave. His department has been short on people lately so he's been calling employees at other locations to see if they'd work at his location while he is on vacation. One of the employees is a woman named Brandy (25 F). 

Just a quick backstory, Ron and Brandy worked together when he managed a different location. Apparently Brandy can be very crude and inappropriate at work. About 3 months ago, Brandy stopped by our building on my day off and spoke to Ron. I'm not sure what they spoke about, but according to him their conversations generally are very casual, mainly about work and things going on in their lives. But as soon as Brandy left, Ron's employees started saying things to him like ""Man you better not let your girlfriend know Brandy was here,"" or ""Better be quick, your girlfriend could walk around the corner any second."" I know this because Ron came to my house to see me after he got off work and immediately told me about it so I wouldn't hear it from someone else and think he was hiding anything from me. And that's something I truly appreciate and is another reason I wouldn't think he's intentionally being inappropriate with Brandy. However, the fact that his employees said that to him (teasingly or not) but never said anything about to him about Denise who was actually flirting with him stuck out to me when I thought about it today.

So on to the thing that happened today. Ron got a call from an unsaved number on his phone while we were watching TV. I asked who it was and he said ""Oh, it's Brandy."" I muted the TV so he could answer it and speak to her. As I was laying there next to him I could hear their conversation. 

It was mostly just talking about her coming to cover some shifts at our location. There was a little bit of inappropriate stuff, like about her talking about wanting to go out of town this weekend and ""get fucking wasted"". But a few things stood out to me.

First was he asked her to come in on two certain days and she said sure, then paused and asked ""Wait... are you going to be there those days?"" with a kind of flirtatious tone. Kind of weird, but okay.

The second and to me the biggest thing was the fact that he was clearly **incredibly** nervous talking to her. He was being very scatter-brained and stuttering or mixing up his words a lot. And he was holding my hand while they were talking and he was fidgeting with it like crazy. Bending my fingers and rubbing my skin raw. It got to the point where it was hurting my hand so I tried pulling away a little or clenching my fist so he couldn't rub my fingers but he seemed totally oblivious and would pry my fingers apart to fiddle with them. I've never seen him that nervous, even when our company's District Manager shows up unannounced.

The last thing was when I heard her ask ""Hey what are you doing tonight?"" and he said (stuttering a little), ""I'm just about to watch some TV"". Maybe just a minor thing, but I guess the fact that this phone conversation with her was already making me feel kind of off, but I started wondering (possibly over-thinking it) why he didn't say anything about hanging out with me. I'm sure she knows he's in a relationship because she liked a photo he posted of us on Facebook and his relationship status isn't set to private. I guess because the whole point of the night was seeing each other before he left for a week, it just stood out that he just said ""watching TV"". Plus she brought up the ""wanting to get wasted"" thing after asking him that, so it made me think, ""Wait... is she asking him to go out or something?"" When I asked him about it when we discussed it later, he said she actually said, ""What are you doing right now?"" which I guess is a little less ""flirty""? So it's possible I misheard her, but still.

So when he got off the phone, I told him it kind of made me uncomfortable and I wanted to talk about it. I brought up the fact that he was fiddling so much with my hand and he was clearly nervous talking to her, and he said it was because he was worried I'd get upset at hearing them talk or respond to it in an overly jealous way to it. And I don't think I've ever been overly jealous or anything. I don't ask to read his texts or go through his phone. I've told him twice in the past (once when his ex contacted him to ask for some of her things back from his house and then again when he came home that one night telling me about the way his employees were busting his balls about him and Brandy) that he has never given me any reason to doubt him and I never believed in either of those situations that there was anything inappropriate going on. When I asked him why he thought I'd be overly jealous at hearing them talk considering I haven't been that way to him before, he said he it was because he was worried she might say something inappropriate that might ""upset"" me.

I made sure to make it clear to him that I *still* didn't believe he was cheating on me or anything like that, but I wanted to know what kind of things he was worried she might say. Because in my mind, if someone I have a work (or really any kind of) platonic relationship with said something to me that made me think, ""Oh no, my boyfriend would be so upset if he heard that, I hope he didn't hear them say that."" I would immediately shut it down. That's how I view relationships, it's up to each of us to recognize when someone outside the relationship is pushing the boundaries and make sure to make it clear to them that some things are inappropriate to say or do to us because we're in a relationship. Even if one of my coworkers said something inappropriately sexual to me and it didn't bother me personally, it would automatically bother me if my boyfriend thought it was inappropriate and I would make sure he didn't say anything like that to me again because I value our relationship and want to respect his feelings.

So as for the things he was worried she might say, he said she tends to make a lot of sexual comments or jokes, and has said things to him like, ""Wow glad you wore those pants today, they make your ass look good."" As far as I know, she hasn't said anything like the ass comment since he and I have started dating, but she apparently does still say at least some inappropriate things around and to him because I believe that's why his employees were busting his balls about her that one day. 

Now to me, sexually inappropriate things or ""ass comments"" (lol) are definitely not okay when I'm in a relationship, especially coming from someone he works with from time to time. I explained that to him and tried to tell him that even if it doesn't bother him, it bothers me and I wish he would understand why and make sure to set boundaries with her.

His response was that what she says doesn't bother him or offend him, and it also doesn't bother him that his employees might think that's he's doing something inappropriate with her because he isn't doing anything inappropriate and he's told them he isn't. I told him that it bothers *me* if they think that because it's disrespectful to our relationship. I get so embarrassed when I walk through his department and happen to run across one of his employees because I wonder if they're looking at me differently and wondering if I know about Ron and Brandy's ""thing"". 

I feel like I just can't get him to understand how I feel. I tried hypothetically switching the situation and asking if he'd be bothered if what Brandy is doing to him, a male coworker was doing to me. He said he would be bothered. So I told him that that's how I feel. Even if a male coworker said something to me that was sexually inappropriate but didn't personally offend me, if my boyfriend made it clear that it bothered him, then I **would** be bothered by it would make sure it stopped.

In the end, he said he would talk to her and make sure she kept it professional. But I'm worried he may not do it because he seemed aggravated by the whole discussion and was still saying he didn't think it should bother me because he's not cheating. I'm actually not sure how he acts around her when I'm not around (they really don't see each other much, but I know they text sometimes and work together every so often), but I honestly think he's acting in some way that would lead other people to believe he might have a thing for her. Whether he's being nervous, or whether it's a combination of her saying sexual things and him not shutting them down, I don't know because I've never seen them interact. This phone call was the first time I've experienced it.

I guess what I'm wanting advice on is this: 

1) Am I overreacting? I'm probably the queen of over-thinking things so I would believe it if it seems to you guys like I am. It's hard for me to tell on my own so it'd be good to get perspective from a neutral party. 

2) Is there a better way for me to explain how I feel to him and get him to understand that just because he's not cheating on me, that doesn't mean his behavior isn't wrong? He gets defensive and says he's not doing anything wrong, and I try to explain that his lack of action with her (ie not setting up those boundaries) is actually doing something wrong in my eyes.

tl;dr
My boyfriend has an employee that has made sexual comments toward him in the past and might still be doing it now when they (rarely) work together. I can't get him to understand why it bothers me that he's allowing it to happen. Am I over-reacting to the situation? Is there a better way to explain to him how I feel?

My boyfriend and I got in an argument today over our communication skills and his work schedule, which led us to discussing our relationship of 9 months. I am usually open about my feelings for the most part, I know he knows how I feel because I use my words to do so. I never know how he is feeling, and I never ask. Until today. 

&amp;nbsp;

I asked him ""What do you think about our relationship?"" He used words like ""good"", ""strong"", ""I'm happy with it for what it is now."" Ok, fine. I will take that because it is more than I have ever heard from him EVER regarding his feelings. 

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to this, he doesn't like to plan. He prefers living in the moment because in his past relationships planning for their future together never panned out and ended in heartbreak. Even though he feels this way, he (more so than I) mentions having a spouse, kids, summer vacations, etc. All the while I have been imagining these scenarios between him and I.

&amp;nbsp;

To throw another wrench in this situation, I am moving away in a month for med school (3 hours away).  I have been having this uneasy feeling about where our future stands. Knowing he doesn't like to plan, but still (foolishly assuming) he was thinking of ours' together, I asked him what he thinks the future holds for us.

&amp;nbsp;

He says ""It's impossible to say."" I referred back to the wife/kids, etc. This is where he broke my heart, saying ""When I talk about those things with you, I am not directly referring to you. I am talking about myself and whoever I end up with."" 

&amp;nbsp;

After he said that, I broke down. I started crying and told him I just need space and to think. But honestly, I don't even know what to think. I didn't know that we our thoughts were SO FAR OFF.

&amp;nbsp;

Am I silly for having been thinking of our future together, and assuming he was talking about me? Are my thoughts of ""Why should I be staying with him if he can't see the future I can?"" an overreaction? I'm just so hurt at this point, I don't know what to think.

"I blew my friend's [26,M] cover that he cheated on his bachelor party. His wedding got called off. How to repair situation and move on?


I put together a bachelor party for my best friend and our buddies. We have been friends since kindergarten. During the trip, the fiancé’s brother took the bachelor to a massage parlor, where they were jerked off by prostitutes. The bachelor ended up going back to the same parlor the following night.

After the party, the bachelor told his fiancé that he had gotten a lap dance at a strip club, and she freaked out. He obviously omitted all the details about the massage parlor. Fiancé called my girlfriend and my girlfriend convinced the fiancé that a lap dance was a terrible reason to call of a marriage, and that the bachelor is a trustworthy person.

Later, my girlfriend asked me if any cheating had actually gone on at the party. I covered up for the bachelor and denied that cheating happened. 

For the next few days, my girlfriend suspected that I wasn’t being truthful. I am not a good liar. She kept asking me over and over if cheating had happened, which I kept denying. She became more and more suspicious of me. After about a week, I finally broke, and told her what had happened. She insisted that the bride-to-be deserved to know. I ended up calling my friend and telling him that I had spilled the beans, and I told him that he should come clean to his fiancé before she hears from another source. He proceeded to tell her the truth, and their marriage is now off. 

I feel guilt for not stopping my friend when I saw him making the mistake of going up to the massage parlor. Currently, he’s not in a good place in life, and our friendship is ruined. While he blames himself for cheating, he admits that he would have kept it to himself and lived with his guilt. I basically spilled the beans and forced him to come clean. He puts blame on me for ruining his marriage. 

I know in my gut that I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I was put in a terrible position by my friend. However, I still feel guilty for not stopping him from cheating, and sometimes I feel as if I am personally responsible for his wedding getting called off. Did I make a mistake by telling the truth? Do you have any advice on how to handle our friendship moving forwards? Thank you reddit!

  **tl;dr**: I blew my friend's cover that he cheated on his bachelor party. His wedding got called off, and he puts a great deal of blame on me. How can I repair our friendship (Or should I even bother), and how to move on from this terrible situation?

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I know I was in the wrong for lying to my girlfriend. I don't believe I was wrong in exposing my friend's cheating. I also wanted to state that this happened a couple months ago. While it rocked my relationship with my gf, she understands the reason I held the truth from her was because dropping a bomb on my friend's life was a very difficult thing to do. For that reason she forgives me for lying and has trust in me. I have learned a valuable lesson that I will be 100% honest moving forwards."

I have a mostly awesome group of friends who are all up in each other's lives. We've grown up with each other, and my fiancé is super close with the guys in this social circle. I've become very good friends with Vera - who is witty, charming, and enjoys the same things I do. For about six years we have talked on a daily basis, gone on trips, and been basically inseparable. 

Unfortunately, I'm discovering she's a social vampire and is incredibly manipulative. She's fallen out with every close friend she's ever had and proceeded to make their lives miserable through almost imperceptible slights, gossip, and backstabbing. I've watched her pretend not to hear people, been on the recieving end of dirty looks, and have been ignored for days on end because I said the wrong thing. At my graduation party for my masters, she cornered me to bitch about something I had innocently said to a mutual friend. At my engagement party the same thing happened. 

Now she's pissed that I'm becoming close with another girl in our group, Lisa. She's dropped everything to become better friends with Lisa, planning outings, constantly texting, and dropping little mean comments in about me. 

We have four major events this summer, I have to be at with her. And our mutual friends aren't catching her bad behaviour. How do I end this ""friendship"" and keep things civil without starting world war three here? I feel like I'm in a stupid competition I didn't sign up for. 

TLDR: friend is evil, I want a friend divorce. Close knit circle of friends is making it difficult. "

"My [26 M] family disowned me, now want to reconnect.


Intentionally vague for the sake of anonymity and because I don't like talking about it. 

I grew up the youngest child of a very conservative religious household. When I was in my mid teens my brothers told my parents they thought I might be gay and they sent me to church based ""counseling"", which devolved into physical and sexual abuse. I got hurt, authorities got involved, and I was put in foster care. My family didn't try to get me back and have said a lot of hurtful things to/about me since everything happened. 

I recently got a message from one of my sisters on Facebook saying that she and my mother are sorry for what happened and would like to reconnect. I am not sure how to respond. On one hand, I really love/loved my family and I missed my mom terribly for a long time. I would like to meet my sister's children and be a part of the family again. On the other hand, I still feel hurt and betrayed that they let those things happen to me and I feel like they threw me away. I know that the relationships we had that I miss are gone permanently. I'm also very close with my new mom and I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like she was just a placeholder until my ""real"" family came back. I don't know what to do or say to anyone.

Thanks for reading, and sorry if anything's unclear.

"Me [22F] with my boyfriend [25M]. My family is giving him a hard time for not being a misogynistic asshole like they are.


Hi, I'm Carla, and I need help with some stuff.

I was born in the US, but my family is very traditional and from a culture where men make the decisions, and women are expected to submit to whatever the man of the family decides.

My family was always like that. Dad makes the decisions, and if he isn't around, my oldest brother makes them in his place. My sister's and I were basically trained to be ""good wives"" so that we will attract a husband, and then submit to whatever that husband says.

I *do* love my family, but as I started getting older I started to reject that line of thinking. It came to a head when I was 19. My family wasn't prepared to help me into college (you know, wives don't need degrees), and I finally decided one day that I was over all that and joined the Army. 

That decision, as you can probably guess, didn't go over too well with the parents and I cut down significantly on my contact with them due to some things that were said. We've actually been doing a bit better recently, starting to talk more, blah blah.

While in the Army, I met Charlie. We've been together for a couple years now. Charlie will be getting out of the Army in a few months, and I will not too long after, and we plan on moving in together once we're both out.

I didn't tell my fam about Charlie for a long time, partially because I didn't really want to share my private life, partially because I knew they'd be unhappy about me dating someone who isn't from their culture. But, with the plans to move in together, I figured it was time for them to meet. 

I told them about him over the phone, and we took a long weekend to go visit a couple weeks ago.

At first, I *thought* things were going better than I expected. Charlie seemed to be getting along well with everyone, my parents and siblings seemed like they liked him.

But then I started noticing some things that I didn't like. For example, Charlie asked me to hand him something, and I jokingly responded ""Pfft, get it yourself."" Charlie knows me well enough to know I was kidding, but my brother looked at him dead serious and asked ""Are you gonna let her talk to you like that?"" Charlie obviously wasn't sure how to respond to that, but I diffused it by just handing him what he was asking for.

Another thing I noticed was my parents constantly asking Charlie about future plans, and never paying the slightest attention to what I had to say about it. They asked about where in the city we're moving to and where we want to live in it. Charlie started to say he was going to let me make that call because I'm a lot more familiar with the city, but my dad cut him off and told Charlie ""She'll be fine wherever you choose."" Another pretty akward silence.

Another weird moment came when my parents asked when we are getting married. I started to tell them that we really didn't have any plans for that right now, and my dad looked at Charlie and asked him ""But you're going to marry her before you move in together, right?"" Charlie echoed that we didn't have any plans for marriage for now, and my dad cut him off again and just said ""Marry her. Before you move in.""

I think the biggest transgression I didn't even know about until afterward. On the drive back to the post Charlie and I are at, Charlie told me that my dad and my older brother had spoken to him privately that night and told him that he (dad) was concerned that Charlie let me walk all over him, and that I can get ""stubborn"" sometimes, and Charlie needed to be able to ""handle"" me. They told Charlie to be more ""firm"".

Charlie was obviously uncomfortable about that, and who can blame him? 

All that aside, basically any time now that I mention future plans to my parents, it's ""Well what does Charlie say?""

A big part of the reason I'm happy with Charlie is because he isn't like that. I rejected that aspect of my parents' culture for a reason and I hate that we're catching crap over it!

I don't want to cut out my family......despite it all, I *do* love my parents, even though I'm mad at them. And I have nothing at all against my sister's, at least. But I'm also sick of hearing about it, sick of my boyfriend being given a hard time for *not* being a douche, and I don't know how to handle it. Not to mention Charlie has no idea how to handle this, and I don't know what to tell him.

"My [28/F] now ex-bf [30/M] lied about his whole life: Purple Heart, family, cancer...


I've recently had issues with my boyfriend of 3 years... well ex now. He's the only man my daughter has told that she loves him (other than paw-paw). He talked about our future as a family, and how we are raising her, said he'd kill or die for her, claimed her as his own... She's only 7, I'm hiding what I can from her. 

It all started when I found out he was cheating on me with a 19 year old girl. She didn't know about me or my daughter. She knows now, and has ghosted him. She's helped me out a lot in the situation, gave me texts, photos, snapchats. I'm grateful for her kindness and maturity. But as of now, cheating is the least of my worries.

He's lied about his military career. Told everyone about his 3 deployments and how he was injured, he said it was an IED explosion and he was shot twice in the altercation, spending time in overseas hospitals. It was a lie. He's never been deployed. Not once. I helped him through his fake PTSD attacks, his crying when he was drunk, pitiful about how he killed women and children. It's sickening. Even used my daughter as an example 'You know one of the kids I killed was no older than (my daughter's name)?""
He lied about his little brother who died when they both got deployed together. He blamed himself because he wasn't there for his little brother when he died. His brother never existed. I pet him, reassured him threw every fit he had... Had me reduced to tears along with my sympathy.

He had a previous marriage and daughter that he lied about. He said she packed up and left him on his 2nd deployment, said she was cheating on him and took her pregnant belly with her. Said she filed for abandonment and he never saw them again. But I found another local woman that didn't have the same name as his ex-wife, with the exact same pictures of this child. He lied about it all.

He lied about his ex-gf's boyfriend stabbing him 5 times. No police report, no hospital trip, all self-inflicted. Told conflicting stories to different people. He made her out to be a monster, he cried to my daddy that she abused him. She's actually a nice girl, I've apologized to her recently, she's moved on and is very happy in a healthy relationship.

He lied about having prostate cancer. Could not tell me the stage, proper treatment, facility, medications, no unexplained absences (it apparently ""happened"" while we were together) 

He got drunk and pulled me off the bed one night, fracturing my toes and foot. He then took the magazine out of his firearm, put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, it didn't go off, there was a bullet in the chamber. My daughter was in the next room. I was scared and called his doctor and left a message. She thought it was his sister and contacted her instead of me. He found out, told his sister that I'm crazy, then yelled at me and said that if I told his doctor anything, he'd end up in a padded cell... I should've pursued that more.

Wednesday night he knew I knew everything and was planning on discreetly leaving (I had been preparing for a month). I called my parents (both police officers) for help, they were an hour away. I will never forget his face, how he smiled the whole time as he said ""Well I got one on you, (daughters name), and your parents for a good 3 years huh?"" I started recording with my phone before that because I wanted proof if he hurt me. I was alone with him, and scared. He noticed and came after me, grabbed me to get to my phone, and I tried to run out of our back door, he took my phone and slammed it down the 2nd floor balcony, and just smiled at me as I screamed and cried 'why'...

The police came, all military veterans and I explained everything that happened. They asked him about his time in the military and his deployments. Hearing him say 'no deployments' killed me. Sitting there realizing everything was a lie. Helping him with his PTSD was a lie, all the fake nightmares and crying from him. He was a hero to me... I felt sick. They told him to grab some clothes and leave. He did. My parents came and packed what I could and am safe. They were heartbroken, they loved him as family, had the same sympathy as I did... knew that their grandchild was going to suffer for it.

My phone was trashed, but still rang, I couldn't answer it. Took it to the Apple store and it backed up automatically to my iCloud, but was ultimately shattered and battery was swollen. $700 destroyed. (possible update with that if I can press charges bc I'll have proof he threw it and have proof of admitting to every horrible thing he's lied about. Also grabbing the police report from when the cops came.)

How do I handle everything that's happened? How do I not cry in front of my daughter... How do I tell her anything about why he's gone? She loves him... I will never forgive that. How do I trust another man ever again? Do I just block it out and move on? He's truly a sick person, and I know every truth about him, what are the chances of him trying to hurt me, my daughter, or even himself? Why do I still miss him? Why am I mad at myself instead of taking it as his fault? I feel so helpless, sick, gullible, and used. I paid off his credit card, bought him a gaming laptop (to be fair, he paid a lot of the laptop money back, only short $500 out of that), gave money for his dentures, paid for his 'ptsd' medicine when he didn't have insurance... 
But a silver lining, all the talk of us getting married, future children, just future in general... won't ever happen with us. I have a bright future in law enforcement about to start in a couple of weeks.

I apologize in advance as some details here are going to be gross and may not be suitable for all readers.  


I have struggled with pelvic pain most of my adult life and over the last year it has become increasingly worse.    
I have had multiple surgeries trying to correct the issues that I have but in the end nothing has really helped, in fact it just created more scar tissue. In April I was working a job that I did not find fulfilling, so when I was offered a better position with better pay I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately the month that I started the new job ended up being one of the worst pain months I have ever had. It's hard for me to focus and concentrate, which is not good because I am in a very technical position and it is self taught.   I went to my OB to discuss pain management options, I had an ultrasound that revealed multiple lesions on my uterus, multiple cysts on my ovaries and a complex cyst on my right one that has the possibility of being cancer.  
Now I have a Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy scheduled for the end of July and I have to take at least a month of leave from my new job to get this taken care of.


Here's the problem, frankly I feel like a giant asshole loser who is letting everyone down. We are short-handed at my new job already and one of the main people today just gave 2 weeks notice. My manager/company owner is being completely awesome about the situation which makes me feel even worse. I really care about these people and I feel like I am letting them down. I feel like I am letting my husband down. We have been married for 11 years and tried for a while to have children and that did not work out well and now, any possibility of having biological children is completely gone. Also he now has to take at least 2 weeks off of work to take care of me post-op and that just completely adds to me feeling like a complete loser. Can't have kids, can't work my job, can't even take care of myself! 


I can not express the absolute feelings of self loathing and self hatred I have right now. I am so scared of this surgery, I am so scared I have cancer... I am so scared that everyone is going to be mad at me. I feel like I should be able to control this situation and I can't. I just keep crying and beating up on myself over this and it sucks!  


I don't know where to go from here. I have a therapist, but I rarely see her and don't really have great history with therapy so I don't think talking to her about this is going to help much. I guess what I am asking here is: have you gone through a similar situation?  
And if so, how did you handle it? What kinds of things did you do to get in a good mental state? I just hate myself so much over all of this. I have no idea how to move forward here.  
Any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT:  Oh my goodness, I left work and when I got home I checked this and am blown away by the outpouring of compassion and support that you, you beautiful Reddit strangers, have showered on me. Thank you all so very much for your kind words, advice and personal stories. You have really helped me out a lot, and given me much to think about. Thank you everyone, thank you so very much. I wish I could give each and every one of you a huge hug and show my appreciation.

  **tl;dr**: I just found out that I have to have a hysterectomy and found out that I possibly have ovarian cancer. I just started a new job and have to take a month off for this. I feel like I am letting everyone down including my employer, husband and family. How do I deal with this?"
