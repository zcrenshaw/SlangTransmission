"when people ask me if i like being gay..my response is.. you can't say happiness without saying 'Penis'


 and then i think for real... is this why back in the day,  gay meant to be happy ???"
"I think I'm going to be laid off today


They've asked myself and the other folks in my department to attend an HR meeting this afternoon regarding ""organizational changes."" Ugh.

There's a good chance (I'd say 50/50) my department is moving to a different part of the country. They'll probably offer us our current positions, but only if we relocate. I don't plan to. I've found the man of my dreams here in Portland, and, while he might consider moving with me, I don't want to have to force him to make that choice. And I'm not moving without him. So there you go.

I've been laid off 3 times in the last 20 years, so I'm not freaked out. I've got skills that are very marketable, so finding a new job isn't going to be too difficult, but still.

At least I'm not in love with my straight best friend.

Edit: the suspense is over. Not *exactly* getting laid off or relocated, but I have to reapply for my own job. Yes, just like in ""Office Space."" :rolleyes:"
"[UPDATE] Possibly sexual incident with my massage therapist



[original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6hbi1x/odd_possibly_sexual_incident_with_my_massage/?st=J42YR59I&amp;sh=831ba835)

Okay so when I wrote my last post, it had been like 4 days since my last massage + whatever the fingering thing was. 

And as weird and desperate as this is gonna sound, I just kept thinking about it. So I figured I should just get it over with and figure it what's going on. And if it was paranoia, I would rather find out early so I wouldn't make a fool of myself thinking it was something it wasn't. 

So I called in Friday morning and asked if I could move my appointment up. (I had the day off so it didn't matter much when I came in). 

The receptionist said things were really busy there and she wasn't sure she could get me in earlier. I asked if she could check because I had lifted too much and my shoulder was really sore and it would be a big help if I could come in that day. She put me on hold and then came back and said I could come, but I wouldn't be able to see the guy I usually see because he was booked. I said ""that's okay, thank you anyway"" and got off the phone.

Looking back, that could have seemed suspect on my part. But I figure it's normal to have a favorite, right? Like how some people prefer only one doctor?

Anyway, I figured that was that and I would just wait. But then she called me back like 30 minutes later and said that my guy had a cancellation, and I could come in that afternoon if I wanted. I said I would, and she gave me the time and got off the phone. 


So I get there and go in the room and change as usual. And he comes in and looks good as ever. I said before he's Italian and he's one that always has some tan--but in the summer, it's incredible. Their uniform is white shirt and white pants, and it always kind of makes him look like some sort of angel. 

Anyway so I'm already undressed. But I'm stalling because I'm weirdly nervous. And I'm sure he can tell I'm acting weird because I'm not laying down yet like I'm supposed to be. I'm just sitting up with the towel over my lap. 

So I go ""I'm really glad you could take me today. I know it Washington last minute."" 

And he says, ""Yeah, well, I figured something might be wrong since you weren't here that long ago, and you never change your appointments.""

And I was like ""I'm okay. I was happy you got the cancellation though.""

And he says ""I didn't get a cancellation. The client before you was supposed to be my last one. Then I was going to be off for the weekend plus next week. 

So now I'm not sure what to think. I mean, I'm not sure why the receptionist told me that if it wasn't true? And apparently I was the only thing standing between him and his vacation. 

But he said all of this with ZERO expression so I couldn't tell if he was mad or indifferent or what. I mean I don't really know how the scheduling works so maybe they forced him to stay and he had no choice?

So I'm just like ""oh I didn't know. Sorry about that."" And (still with no expression) he says ""It's fine. Let's get started.""

So then I have to awkwardly maneuver so I'm on my stomach. I usually do this before he gets into the room. So I try to do it but I'm like 90% sure I flashed him a little (I know it probably seems intentional, but I swear I didn't do that part on purpose). He didn't say anything though. 

Okay so I finally lie on my stomach again and he's kneading my back and shoulders. 

I'm thinking to myself that if I don't just grow some balls and say something this is gonna bug me forever. 

So I just say ""The massage you gave me last time was amazing. I mean they're always nice, but that one really made me feel a lot better."" And he says ""Glad to hear it."" And he just keeps going and rubs and squeezes my shoulders. And I go ""Yeah. If I'm being honest, I really didn't want it to end."" 

He's moving lower now and rubbing my lower back (nothing sexual yes, but it just feels better than usual. Anyway, the towel is still covering my ass, but I'm getting unintentionally excited thinking about the last time). 

He presses down some and says  ""Why did you change your appointment?""

And I'm confused because I feel like we already talked about this? But I figure then maybe he is mad at me. So I say ""Look, again, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't have asked if I knew it was gonna mess up your vacation."" 

And then he presses down on my lower back *really* hard and says in this really cold voice ""That's not what I asked you."" 

Okay now by this point I'm nervous as hell. But oddly enough, I started getting excited again. I don't know if the way he said it was sexy or I'm sex deprived or I've  become a perv or some combination of the three. 

And what can I say? I moved my appointment because I was hoping today was the day I could go from client to fuck buddy??
 
So I say ""I'm going away next week to see some friends but I didn't want to put off my appointment for too long. So I figured I would move it up if possible.""

And I'm happy with myself for thinking on my feet and exhale the breath I had been holding. 

So he stops pressing (thankfully) and moves his hands so his fingers are caressing my sides. (I say caressing because that's what it felt like to me, and there was zero pressure at that point). 

But THEN he says ""That's not what you told the receptionist.""

So at this point I'm thinking, fuck, what did o say to the receptionist?? In that moment, I was so distracted that I couldn't remember. 

But I had to figure out how to get my lies straight and fast. So I say ""oh, yeah, I just said that so she'd let me move it up.""

And that's when he's says ""Well you should probably stop lying because you really suck at it.""

And for some reason that annoyed me. I mean, okay, yes I lied to move an appointment. But I've apologized like 3x already to him already, you know? And I feel like there are worse things to lie about?

So I say ""Why did you even ask me why I moved the appointment if you talked to the receptionist? You just wanted to make me out to be a liar or something?"" (Looking back, I must've sounded insane. But my brain was a little cloudy and I felt like both of my heads were being messed with). 

But he wasn't fazed at all and just laughed and said ""You *are* a liar. And, yes, I knew you had lied before I even asked you."" 

So I ask ""Really, how?""

And he says ""Well, first of all, I pressed really hard on both of your shoulders, one of which you supposedly injured. I was worried and about to apologize for forgetting you were hurt. But you didn't even flinch. You just kept talking.""

And that's when I remembered my fake shoulder injury. So I say ""Yeah, well-""

But he interrupts and goes ""And I think you're lying now too. I don't think you moved your appointment because you have plans. I think you just missed me."" 

Alright now I'm not sure what to do. The little devil on my shoulder thinks I should just get down and suck his dick. But I try to play cool and act like this is all nothing to me. 

So I go ""It could be the other way around. I mean, I didn't postpone my vacation for you. But that's exactly what you did for me.""

And he paused for a second, and then moved one of his hands up my back really slowly. But then he did this thing where he put that hand on the back of my neck and pressed down (it definitely could've just been part of the massage but I had so many other things in mind at that moment). And then I almost *passed out* when he said ""In another context, I might make you pay for saying that.""

Well. Alright. By that point I couldn't take it anymore and decided my life would not be complete unless I had sex with this man. 

When he finally moved his hand so I could talk, I just went full YOLO and said ""Do you want to come back to my apartment?""

He stopped again and said ""I don't usually socialize with clients. So it would depend on why you're asking me over.""

So I'm thinking now he might be using ""socialize"" as a euphemism for ""fuck."" But the last part seemed to leave the door open a crack so I say ""Well, uh, I remember you saying once that you sometimes do home visits...""

And he made this chuckling sound said, ""For my disabled clients, yes.""

So I just say ""oh"" and feel a little embarrassed. I mean, this seems like clear rejection.

But then he stops the massage completely and says ""But, technically, I was off 20 minutes ago. So let's go.""

Aaaaaaand, he ended up coming  back to my apartment. Turns out my gaydar is on point after all. 

I would write out what happened but this post is already ridiculously long. And I don't know if anyone actually  to read graphic details about my sexcapades. Soooooo maybe I'll just say things went very well ;). I may make another post at some point about the sex and why I don't think this will ever go anywhere, but I'm undecided. As of this moment, I'm just content with having a really hot memory. 

Thanks for the help bros!!!! The drought is officially over!

**Tldr**; bumped up my massage appointment and, after some tense flirting, ended up just asking the guy to come back to my place. He agreed (with very little hesitation). And we had an incredible time. Drought's over :)

Edit: by the way, I don't expect people to accept this as the truth. That doesn't offend me at all. I'm on an anon internet account and a throwaway at that. But even if I full-on doxxed myself, it wouldn't prove anything, so I just don't see the point. I also said myself in my first post that I *know* it sounds like a porno. That's partly why I didn't discuss the sexual part of what happened in this post. Anyway, if this is the wrong sub for this kind of stuff, I'm sorry. I was just sharing what happened because people kept asking (and, honestly, my friends are probably getting tired of hearing about my sexual frustrations and/or adventures). Enjoy your day!


**Edit #2**: Want to clarify something else that I keep getting PMs about (apparently this was cross posted in another sub as well). I am not currently injured. I thought that was obvious in my post. I *started* getting massages because of some injuries I had sustained. (I used to play a bunch of different sports, but now I just work out). I get massages now for maintenance only and occasional soreness. The shoulder thing was a lie I told the receptionist to get my appointment moved up. My MT obviously figured it out, and that's why he called me out for lying. If people have more questions, feel free to ask. I have no reason to be secretive on an anon account. So I'll happily respond to *questions* but not to the general ""I don't believe you"" comments. Believe whatever you like, friends. "
"[UPDATE] I've been lying to my BF for months about something really stupid. Now I'm about to get caught...



[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6gphvx/ive_been_lying_to_my_bf_for_months_about/?st=J3USGHFV&amp;sh=c6cf3813)

Okay I didn't expect so many people to be interested in this lol. This post blew up while I was sleeping and I was scared to read the comments bc I thought I was gonna get tons of judgment for this. But for the most part everyone was nice and helpful, so thanks for that. 

I ended up talking to my bf. It was good and bad. 

The bad part was that I realized this is worse than I thought in terms of the lying.  I guess I didn't see how this had spiraled out of control so much until I had to sit down and actually talk about it. 
 
So here's what happened. 

I asked if I could come over to his apartment to talk to him. And he was already kind of surprised because we weren't supposed to hang out today.  he was super busy but I said it was really important. (I said that because I knew if I didn't get this over with, I would be 30 before he knew my real age). So he told me to come over but he's already kind of on guard and everything since he thinks it's bad. 


So he asked what's so important that I had to talk to him right away in person (that's another thing -- I text all the time and I have no problem sending really long texts lol. And I don't think I've ever told him I need to talk in person about a problem since we've been dating so this probably all seemed really dramatic to him, but I didn't know what else to do).

So I sit down on the bed and I'm like ""promise you won't break up with me or hate me."" 

Well then he asked if I had cheated or something. And I'm thinking ""yeah right - like I would be dumb enough to cheat once I finally get a boyfriend??"" I didn't say that though. 

Tbh I was almost glad he asked if I was cheering bc anything else I told him would be better than that lol. So I told him it wasn't cheating but that I hadn't been fully honest with him since the beginning of our relationship. 

By then he was getting kind of tired of me beating around the bush so I just said it: On my birthday I'll be 21 and not 23. 

He was really surprised and at first he thought I was kidding and then told me to tell him what I really came to talk about. And I told him that was it. And I brought out both my IDs (fake and real) bc I brought them especially to show him. And then he looked and was like ""oh my god you're such a liar."" But it was weird bc he honestly looked like he was trying not to laugh. 

I daid I was sorry though. I didn't even have to tell him why I lied bc he remembered our first conversation. He was like ""I should have known the way you kept questioning me about the age thing. I just thought you were over analytical."" 

And then he started asking if there was anything else I had lied about. And I mean, there is. But it's all related to my age. Here's the breakdown:

-He looked st my Facebook a while ago and asked why I had uploaded the high school graduation photos two years late. (Because he thought until now I was two years older than I am, so he was confused. I basically told him I had this big gay life crisis and try to suppress the memory of a closeted graduation. But when I finally came out two years later, I decided uploaded them all. (This is the worst lie and I literally feel like a huge piece of crap for making this up and even worse that he believed me)

- I also told him that the same faux gay life crisis also caused me to delay going to college for two years. That was a lie. I went at 18 and I'm graduating next May, on time. (I know it's awful and I'm sorry to anyone who's actually had such issues - I swear I will never do anything like this again and I feel really guilty about it)

-My ""little sister"" is really older than me by almost two years. (I didn't technically lie about this. They became Facebook friends and she puts literally everything on there so he just looked at her page and started calling her my ""little sister"". And obviously I couldn't correct him, otherwise he'd know that I had lied about my own age)

-I had to say I was EXTREMELY sorry that I almost got us banned from a club because he'd argued with the bouncer who said my ID was fake. (It was horrible. I wanted to leave but my boyfriend said we shouldn't have to. And this guy was freaking HUGE and very annoyed so I was honestly scared he was gonna pick us up and throw us out by force). But the manager ended up coming over and his sister or someone worked at the law school where my bf was a student at the time. Not sure what this had to do with my fake ID but he let us both come in. 

-I also had to apologize for a similar incident at a liquor store where my ID was temporarily confiscated and the manager almost called the cops.  (Long story. Even worse than the club thing tbh. I MIGHT explain in the comments if anyone cares and if you all promise not to judge me too hard. Again, I've apologized a TON for all of this and I feel really really bad).

Anyway, when I finished, he said he felt like a complete idiot and that if he couldn't even figure this out he'll probably be a terrible lawyer. And even though he was half-joking that made me feel awful bc he's really not dumb. He just trusted me way more than I deserved. 

And by this point, even though he seems to find humor in some of it, and I'm really worried he might think this over and stop speaking to me (or at the very least dump me and go find a sane person to date).

But he didn't dump me (at least not yet lol). It's hard to explain what happened after that tbh. Idk if he was oddly flattered that I went through so much just to date him he or if he was just horny or sick of  studying or what. But we ended up having really weird rough sex which was kind of fun. 

And then when that was over he told me not to lie anymore. And believe me, I'm not going to because this was stressful AF. 

And that's basically it. 


TLDR; I told him the truth and he doesn't hate me, thankfully!


***EDIT***: 

okay people keep asking why the sex was weird. I didn't go into detail at first bc it's totally irrelevant to my problem lol. I just said that to explain we made up. But since people keep asking, I'll try to explain. I don't know how to do the NSFW tag thing so consider this a mild warning, I guess. 


It was WEIRD because it was the least sexual situation imaginable. 

I wasn't really prepared for it because he was supposed to be busy (he studies for like 7 hours during the weekdays and he had other stuff to do as well. He didn't even bother to move his books and stuff off the bed). 

Anyway I'm sitting there trying to give a quick but thorough apology and GTFO you know? Also I really was expecting him to hate me, so...the last thing I expected was anything remotely sexual. But at that moment I was soooooo grateful that I always clean myself really well in the morning regardless. 


There was really no lead up to it. I mean I was still talking and then he just kind of grabbed my face and started making out with me. And I sort of mumbled against his mouth that I thought he was still studying. And he just pulled back and kind of shrugged or something said ""I need a break.""

And that's when he just got on top of me and held my wrists so I was pinned (which was really unnecessary because I wasn't trying to move lol). And he kept kissing me if you can call it that. But it was more like being attacked with my mouth. 

Anyway, he managed to get some lube out of his side table drawer. And he only fingered me for like 60 seconds before he was going in...and it didn't actually hurt when he first managed to pop in there, oddly enough. 


But then he just started thrusting way harder than normal and sucking/biting on my neck at the same time whereas he normally just kisses of licks me there. 

And idk I was kind of scared but I also really liked it at the same time...tough describe. 

Anyway idk if it was because of the speed or the friction fact that his abs kept rubbing against my dick. But I ended up cumming even though I didnt jack myself off.  


But then instead of getting off me he ended up flipping me over and it kept going. And at this point I'm like what the hell because he usually doesn't have THAT much stamina. But I think now maybe he came when I did and then got a second wind or something. And he smacked my ass a few times which he sometimes does anyway. And it didn't hurt at all at the time but afterward I was a little sore. 

And I also noticed later that I have a few bruises. (Unfortunately I bruise super easy and I know he's gonna feel bad when he sees because this has happened before--not during sex, but when we were playing around l--and he got a little freaked out by it. But I have two older brothers besides my sister so I've tried to explain that I'm not that fragile lol).

That's pretty much it.

"My sister have accidentally outed me to my parents...


... 3.5 YEARS AGO. (⌐_⌐ )

I had the most bizzare day ever.

I visited my parents today and we had a casual talk about nothing important really.

After the dinner we were chilling on a couch and then my father did what he always does - reached for his wallet to ""support his child"" (don't judge, it always makes me feel awkward, but that's just what they do to my other adult siblings as well).

But this time, my mother said something more... She gently said that ""they are giving this money to ME. Me, not my ROOMMATE""... It felt really, really weird so I asked ""why would I think that this is for my roommate?""

She said something like ""we do realise that there is something more between the two of you, than between regular friends"". At this point I was all (˵⊙▃⊙˵ ) but she was carrying on.

While my mind was full of ""OMG THEY KNOW. IT'S OVER."", they seemed to be all ""where was your brain when you were chosing your partner?""

My parents doesn't like my SO, because he used to bully me when I was a child and then and they had a lot of trouble with him. I was so embarrassed that I couldn't really explain them that he's a changed man now... (◔_◔)

When I finally kicked the cat that got my tongue, I asked how did they know. I wasn't able to use the word ""gay"" or ""homosexual""... My mother said that my $#%@\^ sister outed me almost four years ago. They haven't told me because she was begging them to not reveal her mistake.

Looks like they had a lot of time to think about it and they were so ""meh"" about my orientation, that it wasn't a big deal for them, anymore. And yet I don't feel relieved. (･ิ_･ิ)

I feel like I skipped some important phase and I don't really know how to feel about it... something is missing.

Anyway, I needed to vent. My SO wasn't really helpful because he's all wprried, concerned and pissed that my parents don't like him and share the popular opinion among people close to me, that he's abusing me or something... (◔_◔)

Now I have to talk with that $%\^@# retard a.k.a. my sister... Looks like they don't know about my engagement...

"Gay dad struggling to make friends


I am a 33 year old gay male. I have two kids, I struggle to make friends, as gay men that I meet tend to run and hide when they find out I have kids, and straight couples tend to lean the other way due to me being gay. I live in NH and there isn't a huge culture up here. Are any of you gay dads? How do you handle the balance of wanting to socialize and family life, I have been out for 7 years, and married my husband 5 1/2 years ago. I feel like I have trapped my husband, are social lives are non existent and just can t find a way to meet people and make friends. We live the typical family life, which is what we both want, but we need to socialize and keep are selves happy "
"Any other gay prudes out there? How do you handle dating and being in a relationship?


So I'm pretty reserved for a gay 20 something, I don't like casual sex at all, and have never done anything kinky, plus my number is pretty low. I should also say I'm decent looking and work out regularly and I tend to get a fair amount of attention, so me being a prude is just how I am not because I can't whore around if I wanted to.

Anyways, every guy I've dated has been the opposite of me. They've all been on grindr for years, tons of casual sex, group sex, lots of kinky stuff. When I first started dating this didn't bother me, since I didn't think anyone's sexual history would affect our relationship but 3 heartbreaks later and I'm good and scarred.

I think the biggest issue I faced was not feeling understood. It felt horrible not being able to relate to them on most stuff about sex, or hearing stories from their friends and feeling like a loser/less of a man for not having had any of those experiences. Plus they never understood why I thought opening up the relationship was so bad, or why I'd get upset when they'd drool over other guys in front of me, or why i never used hookup apps before.

At this point I just want another guy whose naturally more prudish, I think I'd feel more understood and comfortable with them, but finding such a man has proven very difficult, so being realistic I doubt it'll happen.

I'm trying really hard to figure out how to not let contrasting views about sex ruin my relationships, as finding love is the most important thing to me.

So for gay guys who are on the reserved side, how are you keeping your head up in the dating world? How do you trust someone who's always enjoyed casual sex if you want monogamy? How do you not feel emasculated if you're no where near as sexually experienced as the person your dating?"
"After hitting Reddits ""random""-button, I've gotten your subreddit 7 out of maybe 50 times. So here's a question for ya...


Have any of you guys had SO's with similar body physique as yourself, but you haven't been able to swap wardrobes because their style is *so* not your style? I've always wondered if this might cause tension in a relationship, and if it feels like you are missing out on one of the benefits of gayness (Sorry, might be the wrong word). I also wonder if a similar situation would arise if you are a boxers-type, while the other is mainly briefs.

Sincerely, curious (not in a sexual way, though. Okay, maybe a little? Aren't we all?) guy. "
