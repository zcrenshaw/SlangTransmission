"HR managers HATE this one trick


Every office has their special users.  The ones who can't figure out anything technical, everything is an emergency, and everything has to function exactly the same or they can't work.  At my job, it is the HR lady.  Since she is just HR, all her problems boil down to a printer error, excel, word, reboot and it works type of issues, and since I am the System admin they are all my responsibility.  

However, every issue she has she comes back to IT, walks right by my desk goes to the programmer, manager, network admin and explains the issue.  Every time they either tell her to go me (even though she gets bitchy), or relay the info to me to fix.  

A few weeks back, she had a problem with the calculations on an excel spreadsheet.  Everyone was at lunch, so she's forced to ask me.  Immediately, I say it is probably rounding up or down because it is only off by a penny.  This doesn't suffice, so she ignores me and waits until lunches are done to return.  She goes to programmer guy and like usual, he passes it to me.  I email her with a breakdown showing how it is rounding.  She still wants programmer guy to look at it, so my manager responds with a message saying he will get to when he can.

Well, programmer guy is swamped, the new website launch is getting pushed out, her excel ""problem"" gets shelved with her emails coming ever more frequent.  My manager even resends my explanation, but she wants programmer guy to look at it.  This is unacceptable, so she goes to the VP saying we aren't helping her.  

My boss sets up a meeting with the 3 of us for me to explain the issue.  It was the shortest meeting ever because I start explaining it and our VP completely understands right away.  The VP cuts me off, looks at HR lady and says ""You pulled me into a meeting for this shit?""

TLDR; HR lady with easy issue ignores obviously solution only to be burned by VP.

"I can't beat lvl 20 on Candy Crush!


I'm a Network and Server Administrator at a hospital, but I occasionally field help desk calls as well. So, one day I'm slow so I'm helping answer some calls when one of our Switchboard Operators calls. 

Me: IT. 


Operator: Hey, I have a problem. 


Me: OK, what's up?


Operator: I've been playing Candy Crush on my phone and it keeps messing up. 


Me: What do you mean? Is your phone disconnecting from WiFi?


Operator: No, I just can't seem to beat this level no matter what I try. 


Me: *trying not to laugh* Uhhh, I'm not familiar with that application. Each department is supposed to have a Super User for their applications which handles tech support between the users and the vendor. Have you engaged your Super User?


Operator: *getting pissed* No, smart ass, I didn't. 


Me: *Holding back laughter as well as Jimmy Fallon on SNL* I'm sorry you're upset ma'am, but all I'm doing is trying to help you by getting you to the most appropriate channel for support of your issue. 


Operator: I thought that you may have played this game before and that you may be able to help. 


Me: No ma'am, Candy Crush isn't an application that the IT department uses or supports. 


This was the most humorous call I've gotten. What made it so funny is that the user was getting so mad that I couldn't help her and that I was laughing at her. I mean, come one.
