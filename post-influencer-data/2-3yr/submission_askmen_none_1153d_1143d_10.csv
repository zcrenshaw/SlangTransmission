"Why do you think shorter men face discrimination because of their height? I didn't know this was a thing until last night.


I was at a bar last night with some of my friends. A shorter guy hit on my very attractive friend. She politely said she wasn't interested but after he was gone my group seemed to just rag on this guy about how pathetic it was for a shorter guy to hit on her. I couldn't believe it. I spoke up about it and even used the analogy to calling a girl fat. Apparently it's not the same according to them. I just told them they were all being incredibly shallow and they just laughed it off and told me to go make the guy feel better. Then they made a comment about his penis size being small. I felt awful for him. 

I was feeling a little disgusted by them because the guy wasn't ugly at all and he was incredibly nice and friendly. Do shorter guys get this treatment normally?

As a measly 49 foot man I feel we get the short end of the stick too often (no pun intended)."

Mine: When they wrap a towel around their head after bathing? Their hair is in there, wound into the towel.

"How many of you don't drink alcohol?


I ask, because as a 36 year old male it seems like all of my male friends drink. Some drink at parties. Some seem to drink to deal with their problems. Some think it's a manly thing to do. 

I don't drink because alcoholism seems to run in my family. It scares me that I could end up like some of my family members.

I've been called gay and I've been told I am not a man, because real men drink. It's never bothered me, because I have my reasons.

I am just wondering how many of you do not drink. Has it affected your friendships or how people view you in any way?

"What's it like dating a sexual assault survivor?


I [34M] met a woman [28F] about a month ago and we've been getting progressively more into each other and serious. 

She is a very attractive, mature, open, accomplished, smart, and kind woman. She was also the victim of a brute force rape about 3 years ago. I am the first guy she's approached actual relationship territory with since that time.

At least to this point she seems like someone with very high potential (quite literally hits all the bases for me) and I want to do things in a way that gives us the best chance in the longer term. We're both feeling ready to begin something together, but this painful part of her past is certainly going to be an issue that I need to be mindful of if I'm going to be the best partner for her that I can be. I'm relatively experienced with women at this point in life, but this issue is a new one for me.

Any of you guys dealt with this before? Pitfalls? Tips for how to deal with bedroom PTSD? How to help her to feel comfortable again if she gets somehow triggered (hasn't happened yet, but I've been warned)? 

Women's input welcome as well."

"What's the cringiest moment you have witnessed?


One time we were in high school and sitting in maths class, this guy and girl were sitting in front of me and this guy (who's known for pulling shit like this and being the biggest whiteknight/NiceGuyâ„¢) tried to put his hand on the girl's thigh and said ""Wow these are some great quality jeans"" and the girl said ""Stop and get your hands off me"" and guess what he does? He keeps caressing her thigh and saying the same line again and again with a trembling voice.  
That day ladies and gents, is when I decided to bring a bottle of bleach with me to school everytime to avoid situations like this.  
What's your stories?"
"Fathers of daughters with boyfriends, how did you evaluate the guy?


Basically, I'm asking how did you HONESTLY feel when you found out that your daughter has/had a boyfriend, how did you get to know the guy, what did you look for in him and why, how did you know he was a good boyfriend. Thanks!

If you guys could give me any tips on how to converse with the father (i am the boyfriend) i would greatly appreciate it! I've met him before, he is kind but i want to impress him - so he could be like ""oh he is a good boyfriend for so so"" - since i rarely speak to him, just that im not a social person. Just assume i suck at conversations with strangers.

Btw thanks for all the replies so far!

"What tips would you give to a Sikh boy going to the barber for the first time?


I asked on /r/malehairadvice but barely got any responses so I was hoping you could help!

Hello reddit, I'm currently in a tricky situation that I was hoping you could help me with (plz don't be a dead thread :D). So basically, I've kept my hair for 17 years since I come from a religious sikh background but personally, I've wanted to cut my hair for a while. But the thing is that with 17 years of having no experience with this whole haircutting thing, I have alot of questions. I'll list them in order:

1. I always see people talking about numbers over at mha, what do they mean? For example, I see people saying to tell the barber to make it ""a 2 long at the top"" or something. I also see people using numbers when talking about fades, what do those mean?


2. So when I'm getting a haircut from a barber, do I need to tell him the numbers I want? 


For example, here is the cut I'm going for: https://imgur.com/aTwntVA


Now would the barber just require the picture to do the cut or do I also have to tell him the numbers I want for the fade?


3. I want the barber to trim my beard but how do I explain how much I want him to trim it?


4. Do barbers also style the hair for you or is that only in salons?


5. How does paying the barber usually work? Is there usually a counter? How do I tip unawkwardly? How much do I tip? This question is really important to me lol.


6. How often should I shampoo and condition my hair?


7. Any tips in general for my first cut?


Edit: HOLY SHIT, you guys are amazing so thank you so much for the fast replies. I really appreciate all of you, much love!

Edit 2: Just want you to know that I've read all the comments so far, thanks so much guys"
