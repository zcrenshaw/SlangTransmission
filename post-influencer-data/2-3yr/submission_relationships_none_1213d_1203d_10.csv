"I [26/f] think my husband [30/m] might be spying on me while on business trips. I can't really prove it but certain instances have me suspicious.



My husband, Henry, and I have been married for almost 2 years- together for 5. We have a pretty normal relationship and I’ve always felt that we share mutual trust in each other. We’ve never broken up and I can’t think of one situation where he would feel that I’m not trustworthy. I feel like I’m going crazy over this…
 
Henry’s career usually requires him to travel rarely but this year is an exception. His company is in the middle of reorganization and he has been traveling to do training seminars about once a month. His trips are usually Monday-Sunday.  I’ve confirmed these trips and, yes, these are legitimate. I’d say we have been handling it well but the past few months, my husband’s been doing weird things that have cause me to believe he’s spying on me or showing controlling tendencies.
 
The first incident was in at the end of March when my husband came home and asked how my friend was doing with the death of her dog. At first, I said that she was sad but doing ok. About a minute later I asked how he knew that and he said social media. The only reason I asked this was because I had a phone call in the living room with my friend when the dog died. Not only that, but my friend had deactivated her page before the dog died so it wouldn’t have been on there. I’m the only mutual friend he had with her, as well, so I don’t think he would see anything that she was tagged in. I asked him if he’s watching me (as a joke). And he said, seriously, “Why would you think that?” I explained it and he said “NO! It was on social media.” I just assumed his defensiveness was because he had jet-lag.
 
The second incident was in April when I went out with my friends during the weekend. That Saturday night, I had texted him that I would let him know when I’m home and it should be around 12:30 am. I got home earlier at about 11 PM and fiddled around in the kitchen for probably 20 minutes. I’ll admit I forgot to text him. I got a text at about 11:20 that said “you’re home?” I told him yes that I was straightening the kitchen and then going to bed. I asked how he knew and he said he “just figured you would be already.” He told me goodnight and I went to bed. Normally, I wouldn’t think anything of this but this latest incident has me looking back on the past few months.
 
Henry got home early from this month’s trip on Friday. I was super excited because he doesn’t have trip until September. When he got home, he asked what I did all week. I explained all of my activities when he said “did you have any friends over?” I said no. And he said “oh? Really?…” I said yes and at that point I was really confused because I truly didn’t have any friends over. He just huffed and stormed off. Again, I assumed he was just tired.
 
I went into the bedroom and asked if he was ok and he said that he was. Later that night, we were talking about my week and I mentioned my brother dropped off some photo albums of my dad (he passed away) and that I wanted to show him some. Henry said “oh! Your brother was here. Ok.” And then mumbled ""that makes sense"" as he walked away. I have really good hearing and I don't think he thought Id hear it. If he had a camera, is it possible he could have heard a male voice and assumed it was another male friend? My brother didn't come in the house but we talked on the front porch with the front door open. I feel crazy just typing this. 

Sunday, because he was at his mom’s, I decided to try and look around. I didn’t want to be too obvious so I kind of just nonchalantly walked around looking at things, accidentally knocking things over and looking at them when I picked them up, etc. I’m sure it was obvious because I got a call from him asking what I was doing. I told him just hanging out when he said “doing what?” I told him I was watching TV (I did have the TV on).There was a pause and he said “I’m leaving soon; I’ll be home in 20 minutes.” He was supposed to be there 3 more hours.
 
Someone tell me I’m overreacting and this is not that strange.  Am I digging too far into this? I don’t know how he would know about my friend’s dog and that I was home early the one night. There’s got to be something going on, right? He’s NEVER acted like this before February. It’s weird. I get home after him during the week so I don’t get TOO much time alone, aside from showers, bathroom visits, etc. Help?
 
 


   
**tl;dr**: I'm suspicious that my husband might be spying on me. I can't prove it but he's acting weird and I don't know what to do. It's starting to scare me. Am I overreacting? "

"[UPDATE] My [21M] is in the hospital because my mom [48F] didn't believe her allergies/dietary restrictions


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iczj7/my_21m_gf_20f_is_in_the_hospital_because_my_mom/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

Thank you to everyone that took time to read the first post and gave me advice on how to deal with the situation. I received an overwhelming amount of responses and I've shared all the love and get well wishes with Brit. 

So.. Tomorrow it will be two weeks since the horrendous dinner my mom (Dawn) hosted that landed Brit in the hospital for five days. 

To clarify, Brit IS very cautious with what she eats but decided that it would make the wrong first impression if she had brought her own meal. We live in Canada and since I drove her to the hospital, the only expenses that would've needed to be paid would be prescriptions. If I had called an ambulance to transport her, she would've had to pay $385. I had no contact with my parents for a couple of days but my brother mediated what needed to be done in order to make this right with Brit. I made it clear that if no expenses/meds/bills were going to be paid off in full by my mother, she would expect I wouldn't be in attendance to dinner, holidays, birthdays or anything else.. ever. Brit's the kindest, sweetest, forgiving person I know. I suggested that we hire a lawyer to mediate and even sue my mother for assault but she laughed at the idea and told me that she was fine and to let it go. 

The day before Brit got discharged, she received a list of all her new prescriptions so I had my brother take them to my parents to get and if they wanted to apologize formally they should bring it with them along with a cheque for a week's pay, a week of rent and no flowers as she's allergic to pollen. Our insurance covers 80% of everything but I did indeed make my mom pay me for the hospital drive as I'll be using it to buy Brit a Tiffany pendant she's been eyeing for a while since I'm still mortified. 

My parents got to the hospital the day she was getting discharged. My dad pulled me outside her hospital room and I let Dawn speak to Brit alone. My dad did admit that the text he sent was not an apology but a half assed statement on behalf of my mom who was too embarrassed to speak on it. Brit and Dawn had a heart a heart, and Dawn sincerely apologized to her and gave her a cheque with almost $2000 and prepaid refills on all her prescriptions. Brit had asked why they didn't take allergies so seriously and just thought it was her watching her weight or being picky. So they spoke of my ex gf (who Brit used to take dance classes with) and how she refused to eat anything with gluten, counted calories, and only had low fat foods. Brit was so understanding and laughed it off. The Tiffany&amp;Co pendant I was planning on buying her was also given to her and Dawn had even told her I had hid it at their house and was supposed to give it to her after dinner until she had a reaction. Tiffany&amp;Co also has an allergy charm and that was also gifted to her as well and she can engrave a few of her allergies on it. Dawn has even bought Brit, her, my dad and I cooking classes so we can make gluten/dairy/peanut free safely in our homes and we'll be taking a class all together tomorrow. We won't be letting Dawn cook dinner for a while, so we'll be dining in a restaurant tomorrow night.

**tl;dr**: Brit's made a recovery, my parents have sincerely apologized and reimbursed her for missing work hours, prescriptions,  and rent "
"My [23F] boyfriend's [24M] mother [50sF] attacked my twin sister because she thought she's me &amp; I'm cheating. Refuses to apologize.


I have an identical twin sister Jessi and we look very much alike. There are small differences but only those who know both of us can recognize them. 

BF and I have been together for a year. Things are good between us.

Last night this happened: my boyfriend's mom went out with her friends to watch a movie and Jessi was there as well with her boyfriend. After the movie one of her friends saw Jessi with her boyfriend. She asked her if that girl is her son's boyfriend (I met this friend at a party a few weeks ago). So she looked at Jessi and thought yes, she is.

She went to her and asked what the fuck is going on. Jessi was confused since she hadn't met her before, and she kept asking her what the fuck is this. At that point she was holding Jessi's arm and she told her to let her go and called her a crazy bitch. Eventually she told Jessi that she's cheating on her son and called her by my name, and Jessi told her that that's her twin sister. She slapped her across the face and told her to stop lying. Her friends then collected her and took her away.

She then called my boyfriend and told him that she's found her girlfriend with another man. I was with my boyfriend at that time. He quickly got it that she must have seen Jessi so he told her and she hung up. She then left. I talked to Jessi, she didn't even apologize to her. After she found out what she's done, she just left.

So my boyfriend talked to her again and an apology is not coming. She feels like she did nothing wrong and she was justified in whatever she did since I hadn't told her that I had a twin sister, so she's justified in harassing her like that and slapping her across the face. She said that she expects an apology for being called a crazy bitch.

I'm really pissed at her for what she did and the least she can do is apologize to Jessi. We were planning to visit my boyfriend's parents this weekend but now I'm not sure that I want to go. I can't just sit there and tell her how cute it was that she mistook me with my twin. I sure as hell don't think Jessi should go and apologize to her.

Should I let this go? Am I overreacting to consider this a deal breaker?

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's mother attacked and slapped my twin sister across the face because she thought she's me and that I was cheating. Now she doesn't apologize. I want to cut off contacts with her, am I overreacting?"
"[UPDATE!!] Me (28F) with my SO [30M] 1.5 yrs, I was helping him out financially, and I had a crisis that he doesn't believe just because I don't want to help him anymore.


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4huuv7/me_28f_with_my_so_30m_15_yrs_i_was_helping_him/

TLDR of original: 
tl;dr: Mom was piggy backed onto my bank account years ago, took all my money, boyfriend thinks I just don't want to help him out financially.

So I had quite a few update requests and it has been about 2 weeks since I posted. The day of my post I went over to his house that evening. I had scrapped together some cash to get him so groceries and dinner from his favorite place to lighten the mood. Because hey, I'm a giver. 

Anyways, I walked in as I usually do and he was on his couch and in front of him was a brand new golf bag. I just set the groceries in the fridge and told him what I got us for dinner. He said ""I don't want it. I'm fine.""

I was just brushed that comment off since I really wasn't wanting to argue with him. I asked him about his new golf bag and he had bought it with his club credit which made me soften up a little bit.

So I sat down in the recliner across from him and started scribbling on my note pad a game plan for him/us with a budget for him and a way he can afford a car.

I told him the game plan and he curtly said ""sounds good."" Then I went out into his backyard (he lives on BEAUTIFUL farm land with a nice deck outback) since I just didn't want to deal with him. And I just sat outside and cried. He came outside and started fiddling with some stuff in his yard and didn't say a word to me.

He said ""So should I just plan on you not talking tonight?"" And then went on about how I have been such a source of disappointment for him financially.

So I didn't say a word, took the groceries and dinner I bought and told him we are done. And left. I blocked his number and he is no longer a part of my life. 

**tl;dr**: Walked out on his sorry ass. I dumped him."

"I [25M] had sex with my disabled friend [24F]. It made her happy but I'm feeling guilty.


My friend Lana is disabled in her legs, result of the accident when she was 14. So she's in a wheelchair. She also has movement issues in the rest of her body.

We've known each other for a few years now, we met at the university and now we're both in grad school. I was her first real friend in her life as she puts it, as others have never been interested in friendship with her. As months and years went by we became closer, we did a lot of things together, we studied together and we were great friends. Her family are rather protective of her but they trust me completely with her.

I never looked at her sexually, she was more like a cousin to me. I never considered dating her either. I really love spending time with her and being her best friend, the one that she trusts and can always rely on.

Yesterday we submitted a major piece of coursework and we're finally free. I asked if she likes to celebrate. I picked her up and brought her to my place, we ordered pizza and had a few beers and enjoyed ourselves. The plan usually is that she takes my couch these nights as she often stays here (a lot of the times it's studying together though).

Last night she was really intimate and kept holding my hand. One thing led to another, we were having sex on my bed. The sex was very good, but that level of intimacy with her was amazing, like something I had never experienced before in my life. After sex she laid on top of me and told me that this was her first time having sex and she's glad that it was with the right person. We slept in each other's arms. This morning I drove her home and when we arrived she kissed me and told me that she's glad that last night finally happened.

I'm a little overwhelmed. On one hand I certainly love her and last night felt very right when it was happening, on the other hand I can't shake off this feeling of guilt that I'm having right now. I feel like she's been more or less isolated in her life because of her physical condition and I'm the first person who's really been her friend and she's opening up to me like that, not maybe because I'm the right one for her or that I deserve her but because I'm the only option. I feel like I'm taking advantage of her.

I don't know what I should do. Are my thoughts valid?

"21/F UPDATE. I confronted his fiancé.




Link to original post. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4joe9s/21f_should_i_confront_this_players_fianc%C3%A9/

First, I just wanted to say thank you to all that replied and sent me personal messages regarding this issue of mine. You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.

After I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fiancée. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.

So I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.

The evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with ""Are you sure you don't have a fiancée?"" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. 

I took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.

We talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.

It wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.

We may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.

I don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.

TL;DR Guy tried cheating with me. Sent screenshots to his fiancée, she was thankful that I told her. We bonded over his misery.

EDIT:

I hadn't even noticed that I misspelled  fiancée (On mobile) Please excuse that error.. LOL

EDIT 2:
I've replied to **most** of the comments. I did not predict that I would get so many responses. I made this update to inform the ones that commented on the previous post or read it that everything had went well. 
Thank you all for your kind praise. I don't regret the decision at all. If anyone is ever in this situation it may feel scary but it's the BEST decision you'll ever make. I hope and pray this guy isn't stupid enough to try cheating on his future girlfriends. With the technology these days one way or another you're going to get caught. "

"My [38f] SIL [32F] is upset that she named her son the same name as my dog.


My previous dog passed away last year. When I got him, I named him “Jasper” because he looked like a “Jasper”. When he passed away I was devastated. After several months, I got a new puppy and named him “Jasper”. I’ve grown attached to the name at this point. 


My SIL just had a baby and named him “Jasper” as well. When she found out my dog’s name is also Jasper, she got really angry and upset. I’m not sure if it’s the hormones, but she completely overreacted and called me names. I got my puppy first and named him first. She never told anyone of possible names she was planning on for her son, so how was I supposed to know she was going to name her son the same name as my dog? I’m not sure what to do right now. She went on Facebook and ranted about it so most of my family knows about this mess. One of my cousins called me and laughed about it. It’s ridiculous right? I’m not a mind reader. How was I supposed to know she was going to name her son that? My parents love to see my puppy and they know that I named my puppy “Jasper” so she must not have told my parents or they could have warned her in advance. 

I’m not sure what to do now. I won’t be changing my dog’s name as that name is significant to me so don’t suggest that. My brother hasn't visited me in the past year as we live 4 hours away from each other. So I don't think he knew that I named my new puppy ""Jasper"" again. Personally I also don't really see what's the big deal either. So what if they share the same name? It's not a big deal.

[CLICK HERE FOR ORIGINAL!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jr4df/i_am_sterilized_and_have_not_told_my_mom_she_isnt/)

At the moment I **[33F]** am no contact with my mother **[in her sixties]**. While I love Mom very much, the pressure got to the point where I am miserable. I went to see her three days ago and talked to her about Paul. I asked her if she knew how much pressure she put on me to fill his place. I asked her to let me talk and not interrupt [which didn't work, she protested a lot of what I said.] 

I told her that: Paul had been dead for half my life. I loved him and always had fond memories of him. However, I was still alive and she acted like I had to live in the shadow of a 15 year old boy. I told her that I did not intend to have children and my partner was not going to marry me. I didn't want to get married or have kids. And that the more she mentioned it, the less I wanted to have kids. 

She didn't like that and it caused a huge argument. She called me ungrateful, said I should have died instead because Paul would never have talked to her like this. Then she burst into tears and said I owed Paul a second chance at life. That is when I kind of knew that she wasn't going to change, that she wasn't going to be the mother I needed. 

I finally just told her it was impossible for me to have a child. I was barren and would never be able to.

She told me to get out and that's the last I talked to her. I informed family I was going to be not speaking to her again, but agreed to keep sending money to help with her care if there is a need. 

So, while I am sad it has happened, I am glad the truth is finally out there. I don't feel like I have to lie anymore. She won't be getting a second Paul out of me and she is mentally ill. I don't think that I am good for her and she is not good for me. 


**TL;DR** Realized my mother is still very mentally ill and that I am better off going no contact in the future. She knows I am 'barren' and there won't be grandkids. "
"(update) The guy my [18M] mum [39F] is dating is acting really creepy towards my sister [20F]. This has caused my mum to act weirdly jealous towards my sister. What can we do to make my sister feel safer and make him stop creeping on her, and for our mum to stop acting this way towards her?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4g8xi7/the_guy_my_18m_mum_39f_is_dating_is_acting_really/

Well its a month since my first post, and the guys gone thankfully, however my sister and I still moved out, for a number of reasons.

It all came to a head a few weeks ago when my mum was out of the house, and her boyfriend was hanging about the house.  I was in my room and I heard my sister scream, it came from the bathroom.  She was freaking out, saying he was hitting on her and touching her/trying to touch her and she had told him to stop and he wouldn't back off, so she screamed at the top of her lungs for me to come.  He was denying everything, saying she was making it all up, saying she was overreacting.  I told him he had to leave the house immediately or I was calling the police, he wouldn't, and I basically pushed him out while my sister called our dad.  When he heard her calling our dad, he finally left the house, still insisting we were the crazy ones and he had done nothing.  I reassured my sister, she was in a very shocked state, my dad came over and we comforted her and helped her feel better.  He called mum and she came back and we all explained the situation to her.

That was the last time we ever saw mum's creepy boyfriend, he broke up with her shortly afterwards. I don't know why, but I guess after that situation, he didn't want to come back ever and had no interest in our mum.  I'm really scared that he was maybe just pursuing our mother to get close to sis the entire time and had no real intentions for our mother.  My sister was kind of traumatised by the whole ordeal, and I convinced our dad to sleep with us for a few nights at our place just to be safe and so my sister could feel safe.

Naturally mum was upset by how everything turned, but we convinced her it was for the better that he was gone, and we finally got her to accept and admit he was a creep all along and should never have been allowed in our house.

Unfortunately, family problems didn't end there.  My sister was way on edge for the next week, way more cranky and irritable than usual, I didn't blame her.  She still wanted to move out, she said she hated living at home after everything that happened, she didn't feel safe.  I told her the dude wasn't coming back, but she still wanted me to move out with her.  She said stuff like ""you don't really love me, I knew it, I don't love you either"", stuff like that which was clearly attempting to guilt me and which I felt was extremely childish and immature.

Unfortunately our mum wasn't too helpful either.  A couple of weeks later, she was already dating a completely new boyfriend.  We didn't see much of this one, but from what I did see here and there, he seems nice enough and not too creepy.  Unfortunately mum started acting the same way again, telling my sister her clothing is too revealing, telling her to wear a bra, telling her to cover up in her own home, even when it was just the three of us around.

I agreed to move out with my sister, and I talked the whole situation over with both our parents and told them of our plan.  My sister and I would borrow some money from mum and some from dad, both of which we intended to pay back in full as soon as we could.  We stayed a couple of days at dad's place, and from there we moved out into our own small place.  Its small sure, but pretty good considering its within our affordability range.  Things are going good so far, and we're moving forward.
   
**tl;dr**: Creep tried to make his move on my sister, she screamed.  He ended up breaking up with our mum.  Our mum found a new boyfriend and she started acting the same way towards my sister, and the two of us have now moved out and are living elsewhere."

"(Update) I (25F) want to talk to a hot guy who I can see from my office window


Update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jlt53/i_25f_want_to_talk_to_a_hot_guy_who_i_can_see/


So we met! Thank you all for your comments, you talked me into doing it and I’m so glad I did. I made a little ""coffee?” sign as a few of you suggested and held it up after our morning wave yesterday. I didn’t put anything else on the paper because I didn’t want to look like a keener but we managed to set something up pretty easily. 


Anyways it went really well. There were just a couple things that I'm not sure about. He's suuuuuper good looking in person, he's really tall and fit and he looks so good in his uniform. We hit it off pretty well. We had coffee and lunch yesterday and we are going for lunch again today, and we've been texting a lot too. When we were walking back after lunch we walked past one of his coworkers who was like “hey its you!” and I guess they were also telling him to contact me. He told me his Christmas sign was meant for me and when I didn’t make a sign back he just figured I wasn’t interested in talking to him but I only didn’t make one back since I didn’t know for sure it was for me. 


One of the things I wasn't sure about is his age, he's 8 years older than me. I don't think it's necessarily a deal breaker but I've never dated someone that much older because they usually want to get married and settle down right away. That brings me to the second thing, he's technically married and is in the process of divorcing and it will be finalized in a few months. Not sure how to feel about that one… he said he is very happy about it but I have to wonder what the cause for the divorce is, but that’s not something I should just come out and ask though right? Also this is stupid but he’s one of those guys who sits with his legs waaaaay apart and I’ve always thought people who do that are assholes but maybe he is an exception to that rule! He offered to come get me when my car broke down yesterday so I know he's a good guy. 


Either way he seems like a lot of fun and I’m glad I finally had the courage to reach out. Thanks reddit!


**tl;dr**: we met up and he seems like a really cool guy. "
"Strain in our (28F/29M) due to naming our baby girl


Hey reddit! I'm on a phone so sorry for spelling mistakes. 

I'm pregnant with a baby girl (25 weeks) and both me and my partner are very excited (we planned for the her too ^_^ ), here's the problem though, when we found out we were having a girl my partner (29M - let's call him Mike) has been set on a certain name. This is the name of the girl he was infatuated with through most of high school and a bit of college (16 -19 years old ish) and though they stayed friends she didn't reciprocate his feeling (let's call her Susan - all name are changed). 

Now Mike says is likes the name Susan due to it being nice, not due to the connection with the high school crush, and that even if he did, he respects her a lot, which could be true but I don't really like the name anyway and the whole thing makes me kinda uncomfortable. The name is also quite rare and neither of us know anyone else, bar her with that name (should also add we met in college and have been going out since he was 20). 

Anyway, I suggested using the name as a middle name and use a first name that we both like as a first name, but he shot me down. 

He then suggest that I name the next child, which I don't really like the idea of because a) there may not be anymore children and b) if there are I don't want to have favourites before they even born, I want everyone to be on a level playing field. 

This is our daughter and I'm willing to be flexible about all aspects of her life depending on what she wants when she's older, but this, her name is something me and my partner should choose together, I want to love it or at least like is since I'll be using it from the day she born til the day I die or if she chooses to change it. 

I've told him that it makes me uncomfortable but he says those feelings are unfounded.

Am I being unreasonable to want to discuss other names? Should I let it slide and see if the name grows on me? 

Tl,dr - partner wants to name our baby girl after his high school crush.

[Link to the OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4is62r/my_girlfriend_25f_broke_up_with_me_28m_on_the/). You should read it or I will look like an ass in this post. 


I just wanted to update on my shitty vacation. The first day was really bad, I stuck to the hotel room for most of it and when I finally went out at night she tried to start fights and get me to stop talking to people because she thought I was going to “cheat” on her. The front desk person found me another room that was a huge upgrade so I moved there for the rest of the trip to avoid my girlfriend. I guess she didn't stay in the old room either so I'm not sure who ended up paying for that but I was expecting a huge bill for shit she charged to the room. 


It was pretty awkward but I did my best to have a good time. I met a ton of people, and it was easy to make friends since everyone thought the situation was hilarious. My girlfriend never went too far away, she would approach me a couple of times every day to ""try and work things out so we can enjoy our vacation"" and she kept an eye on me the whole time. When I wouldn't talk with her she tried to start a fight and a couple times she actually screamed at me for everyone to hear. After it finally became clear to her that I was moving on she stopped bugging me and she flew out a couple days early. I ended up spending most of my time with a group that was there for a wedding and even attended the ceremony. I'd rate it a 7/10 vacation all things considered. 


I feel a bit bad about how shitty her trip was. I did some shit just to piss her off that probably wasn't necessary. I was hoping that she would be mad enough to just move out of my house before I got home but she's still living here with me and now I'm living in my own basement just to avoid her. I did give her an eviction notice but one month is far too long to be living with an ex. My dogs have been staying with my friends so I can make sure she doesn't try to take them or something but her staying here is really fucking everything up. 


**tl;dr**: had a great vacation but still living with my ex. "
"Update: Me [51 F] with my daughter [19 F] - daughter accused of plagiarism


[Original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dob51/me_51f_with_my_daughter_19f_daughter_accused_of/)


(First of all, I'd like to say that I goofed the title on the original post - she wasn't ""accused"" of plagiarism.  That implies that she didn't do it.  She DID do it.)


She told me a bit more about what had happened.    While researching her paper, she took a bunch of notes, including some comments she'd found on the Internet.  She didn't cite her sources (BIG mistake), and when it came time to write her paper, she mixed up what she'd found online and what she'd come up with on her own.


She had a meeting with an advocate, who prepared her for what the hearing would entail.  She was warned that the most common punishment was to receive an F on the paper and an F on the course.  So, she was prepared for that.     There were still some classes remaining before the hearing would occur, plus the final exam.  She attended all of the classes, studied her butt off for the final, and did her very best on it.


She had her hearing last week.  She did what I'd recommended (and a lot of you recommended) - explained what happened but didn't try to make excuses.  The prof was very understanding and heard what she had to say.  The prof commented that it reflected well on my daughter that she'd continued to attend class and write the final - many people would've said ""The heck with it; I'm going to fail anyway"" and not bothered to show up.  


Daughter found out last night that she'll receive an F on the paper (which was worth 15% of her final grade), but NOT on the course.   The prof had told her that she'd done very well in the course overall, so she'd hoping that means she'll still pass the course.    The prof has drummed it into her head that she made a very dumb mistake, and things won't go nearly as well for her if she does it again, so I think (hope) she's learned her lesson here.


Thanks for all of your comments and help!



   
**tl;dr**: Daughter had her plagiarism hearing.  Will get an F on the paper but not on the course.   "

"Update - Something weird happened at a party last night - Me [23F] with my boyfriend 28M] of 1.5 years




Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kj1rf/something_weird_happened_at_a_party_last_night_me/


My now ex boyfriend admitted that he was cheating on me. I think he thought I wouldn't break up with him without concrete evidence so that's why he was lying about what happened but when I told him I wanted to break up he told me everything, that they did have sex in the bathroom and they've been hooking up for about two months. 


I'm living with my brother for a bit but I'm thinking about moving to NYC. Two of my friends have an apartment in Brooklyn and they told me they would rent me the third bedroom. I just want to get away for a bit because most of my friends here are mutual friends of my boyfriend and I, and I think it's unlikely he will stop hanging out with them. 


Thanks for all your advice, I think I knew he was cheating but didn't want to actually admit it. 


**tl;dr**: he was cheating and had been for a couple of months. "
"My [32F] Girl Scout Leader [32F] stole all of the cookie money.


I'm so furious reddit, I need some advice before I do something rash.

I am a co-leader for a girl scout troop of first graders. I don't have a daughter or family member in the troop, but I was in girl scouts when I was a girl and I thought it would be a great way to volunteer and give back. When an old girl scout member that used to be in my troop, Candie, posted about starting up the troop on Facebook, I jumped on board. It's our very first year as a troop and we only have 5 girls. Despite our small number and starting up half way through the season, we still managed to raise $3000 in cookie money, about 1/4 of that goes to our troop to do fun activities with the girls. I myself raised about $800 of that. 

Everything was going great and I was super excited to have a few fun end of the season events with the girls with the money we raised.

That's until I received a letter from the Girl Scout office that they tried to withdraw the money from our account (as leaders we had to start a non-profit bank account under our troop #) and they were unsuccessful. If they didn't receive the money within the next 5 business days we would be removed as volunteers and sent to third party debt collectors.  I immediately called Candie and she acted very confused and said she didn't know why they sent me anything considering she's the primary leader and I'm the co-leader and that she would go to the bank and update me later. 

Well the day came and went and I received no update from her so the following day I went to the bank to ask them to print out a statement for me (she's listed as the primary person on the account so I don't get anything from the bank in the mail). It turns out someone, well obviously her, had been withdrawing money IN the bank over the last month. 50 dollars one day, 200 the next, 400 the next day, and so on until the bank had only 3 dollars remaining. Then the Girl Scouts attempted to withdraw the money and it became overdrawn and we now have a -33 balance from charges from the bank. So then I called Candie to ask her what was going on and she just brushed it off like it was no big deal and told me she could account for 800 of it in ""supplies"" that she got for the troop (what supplies?!) and then just started changing the subject to something else. 

 I then became really worried that Candie would try to throw me under the bus to the Girl Scouts so I went back to the bank and sat down with a branch manager to get some evidence that she had been withdrawing the money. Turns out, Candie DID come into the bank and contest the charges when she told me she would ""investigate"" it, but the bank manager explained to her that when you withdraw directly through the bank (not atm) you have to provide an ID and he had a teller in the bank that specifically remembered her coming in. When the branch manager left Candie in his office to go retrieve some proof for her, she bolted and left the bank. I was shocked, but the branch manager happily provided me with signed withdraw slips from Candie in case I needed to relay them to the Girl Scouts organization. 

I have since spoken with the Girl Scouts organization and they have assured me that Candie will be the one sent to the debt collectors and not me. I'm relieved to hear that, but Candie has NO idea that I know all of this. She actually just texted me to see if I would run the meeting tomorrow because she is busy with work (yea right). At the same time I'm worried that she won't tell any of the parents what's going on. What if she scams them out of more money?? Should I text her and tell her I know what she did or should I just ghost her? 

I just wanted to volunteer... 

edit: words

**UPDATE:**
I just went to the bank to see if she had replaced the money. She obviously did not and the Girl Scouts attempted to withdraw the cookie money again a few days ago. There's another overdraft fee and now the account is at -69 dollars. I then called our local Girl Scouts organization and they informed me that they're still processing this issue so they haven't definitively taken her off the volunteer role just yet, but I should be getting an update from them later today or tomorrow. They told me I should go to the meeting tomorrow and not to give the parents any details and if I have to say anything just be as vague as possible. I'm kind of worried about this because I have a small business in town that my name is attached to and I don't want my name to get dragged through the mud. Also I guess that means I have to respond to Candie's text that I will do the meeting?? I don't really want to talk to her, so I'm not sure what I should do! I will update when I hear more from the Girl Scouts.  

**UPDATE 2**
I received a call from our troop support specialist and she has communicated with Candie to drop off the box of troop items for the meeting on my porch. Candie told them that she will be dropping it off in a half an hour! I hope she doesn't knock on my door and try to talk with me, I will totally lose my damn mind on her! The troop specialist is going to call me back tonight to tell me the verbiage I should use with the parents, but I feel kind of slimy about the wording she used. She said ""right now, only you and Candie know the money was taken.. that's all I'm saying."" Like what is that supposed to mean?! I'm not supposed to say anything to the parents because they don't have access to the account? 
   
tl;dr: I am a girl scout co-leader and my troop leader cashed in all of the cookie money. I don't know if I should respond or ignore her and leave the situation."
"My [28m] fiancee [27f] gave her mother [60f] access to my Amazon Prime account. Her mom went on a spending spree on my dime. What should I do here?


My fiancee Sarah and I have been together for 4 years, engaged for the last 6 months. We currently live together and have some shared expenses. We also share accounts like Amazon Prime (technically my account) and Netflix (technically her account). We don't keep track of who's paying for what, but when she buys something on Prime she'll typically pay me back for it, depending on what it is. 

Sarah and I both do well for ourselves, and we're great about managing our finances. Sarah's mom, Jackie, on the other hand, is not good about managing her finances. Throughout our relationship, Sarah has helped her mom financially. 

To be honest, I think Jackie is completely irresponsible, and a burden to Sarah. She's self-centered, twice divorced, and not eager to find any way to support herself. Sarah also has some residual issues about how Jackie was as a mom during her childhood (hint - not great), but in the long run she helps Jackie out, because she is her mother. 

A year into our relationship, Sarah and I had a serious talk about her mom and my involvement. We agreed that Sarah's decision to help her mom was solely her own - and that as long as she was using her own finances to help, I had no problem with it. For the past 4 years we have functioned this way, and it's never really become an issue for us. Until now. 

For some reason completely unbeknownst to me, Sarah gave Jackie the email and password to my Amazon prime account, which is hooked up to my credit card. When I got my credit card statement earlier this week, I had $700 in charges that I knew nothing about. I saw it had come from my Amazon Prime account, so I checked Amazon Prime immediately. There were charges for women's shoes, books, boxing gloves, sweaters, headphones, a Kindle (!), the list goes on. 

I called Sarah at work and asked her if she had used my account to buy $700 worth of stuff. She quietly explained that she hadn't, but that she may have given her mother access to my Prime account. I was furious but trying to remain calm. Sarah swears that Jackie said she needed to buy some groceries because she's broke. Sarah gave her my Prime, with the intention of paying me back for the grocery bill. Keep in mind - Jackie didn't even buy any fucking groceries. 

I'm upset with Sarah for trusting her irresponsible mother. I'm upset that she gave her mom access to something that's hooked up to my credit card. Sarah has already paid me back the $700, and I can tell she feels terrible about it - but I don't just want that. It's the principle that her mother spent all that money on useless shit, on my dime!

I never thought Sarah enabled Jackie, but now I'm not so sure. I hate to say this, but I'm even having doubts about marrying Sarah at this point, strictly because of how much of a burden Jackie is. I'm worried about our future together...what if Jackie needs a place to live? Or a nursing home? Or needs to be supported for the rest of her life? 

What do I do here, reddit?

**TL;DR -** Fiancee gave her irresponsible mother access to my Amazon Prime account to buy groceries, mother spends $700 on useless shit instead. Rethinking marrying with girl...what should I do here?"
"[Update] My Fiancée [25 F] has slowly over the years been developing unrealistic working habits. Despite my[25 M] efforts to talk some sense into her, no progress has been made. I think MIL [50 F] and my own family have a lot to do with it.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ko28j/my_fiancée_25_f_has_slowly_over_the_years_been/

Pretty much life sucks, wasn't planning on updating this isn't really my thing but I realize for my own sanity sake I think I need to tell someone that I wouldn't, have to deal with later.

On Monday after I got home from work Laura was in the bedroom talking to her mother, I took a seat in the living room to wait for her to finish but overheard her mom tells her that she should just find a job for a little bit. She was in a pretty hostile mood but I figured there was no reason to wait.
Her older brother had been in town since last week and she's been spending a considerable amount of time with him which surprisingly had her feelings extremely stressed out, he really dislikes what she had become.

Our talk started pretty awful to be honest, I basically asked her if anything was wrong with her and what she would need to get back on her feet and a lot of stuff about our relationship, where we used to be and where we wanted to go. It turned into a shit storm pretty quickly of her trying to pin blame on me. 

She told me about the indescribable guilt that she felt each day, how she wanted to do something and move forward with her life but didn't know what to do. She blamed me and my kindness and work ethic for letting her become the person that she is now without much fuss.

She told me that as long I as I was in the picture she felt like she could never venture back out into the real world. She told me that she hated the person that she had became and that she hated how much she dragged both of us down, she said that she loved me but resented my situation at the same time. Her words really hurt.

Her anger turned to sadness and a bunch of crying after a few minutes of yelling, she apologized for everything, she knew the real reason I postponed our wedding and even told me that it should be cancelled permanently. 

We talked a bunch more and we sat down and really thought-out and developed a plan step by step with guidelines of exactly what we were going to do. I'll admit I got my hopes up, I felt like everything was making sense I was understanding her and all that.

It was a highly emotional and stressful part of the conversation I condensed it heavily but I don't think I've ever pushed her to before. But, with the wedding called off and both of us on the same page I figured this time could be different.

The next day at work I couldn't even focus I spent most of my time researching and planning stuff for her, I'll admit I was excited and I even left work early just so we could get a head start.

But, when I got back to the apartment all her stuff was gone, clothes, shoes, laptop, literally nothing was left of hers. The amount of panic and anxiety I felt I don't even know how to describe it. All my calls went straight to voicemail.

She left me a note on the counter along with her engagement ring, key to the apartment and her parking pass. Long story short, she left with her older brother to live with him in Cali, she didn't really think we could turn her life around like he could.It hurt like hell reading her note.

I know it's only been a day (if that) but I still feel just as upset, bitter, angry at myself as I did the day it happened. I can't get a hold of her, embarrassed to admit how many times I've tried. I keep telling myself maybe if I would have put my foot down sooner or paid more attention that maybe we could have worked on it together.

She didn't even tell her parents apparently, because they called me looking for her yesterday when they couldn't get a hold of her either.

I told them where she went but didn't tell them about the note or ring, I cant' deal with that drama yet. My parents showed no sympathy, my mom even tried to accuse me of chasing her off -- I've decided to go no contact with her for while as well as her own parents until I figure myself out.

I know I just need time to think and try to put things into perspective that my life is going to change.

Some may say I dodged a bullet but I just feel like I lost my best friend and that I tried too late to do anything about it. I wouldn't have married her until things straightened out and I wasn't giving her an allowance, time was literally all we had once the wedding was cancelled.

I know probably just sound like I'm in denial or being pathetic but this shit sucks that I didn't even have a say in how it all went down. Even though it's probably for the best I just feel blindsided by the whole thing. The worst part is the cloudiness I don't even know where we stand.

TL;DR: Laura left with her older brother after he convinced her that living with him in California and experiencing some tough love might turn her life around. I found out via a note she left me on my kitchen counter along with the engagement ring I proposed to her with."

"My sister(32f) hates that things worked out for me(34f)


Throwaway. Weird situation. Long, trying to be concise.

Background: When I was 24, I got pregnant by a less- than- worthy man. He wanted nothing to do with it, and did some pretty shitty things to try to hurt me before he cut contact. I kept the baby because I was confident the guy wouldn't be coming back. It was a difficult decision. I lost my job while pregnant, and then my apartment. My parents saved me a hundred times over- they got me a new place, furnished it, and payed for everything we needed for almost 3 years.

I hated that I was living off of my parents. Independence is really important to me. So I took up a hobby that I had when I was younger, thinking I could make a little money on the side by selling it. Maybe enough to pay rent.

I worked when my baby was asleep, sometimes all night. I tried to work a minimum of 6 hours a night on it. It was exhausting, I refused to spend any less time with my baby during the day, and he was (and is) a very, very active child. But I kept going. 

My projects started selling a bit on my online store. I talked to a business around the corner and they agreed to start selling my projects in their store. I worked my ass off marketing my stuff online, bringing baby with me to stores to pitch my products, buying a booth at farmer's markets and festivals, travelling across the country to sell my work, etc.

It's paid off today. I made over 300k last year, I have 5 employees, and I have 2 stores open. Ive paid my parents back for all their help, and then some. My baby has a college fund. He's happy, well- adjusted, very smart, very charismatic and popular. I've never, ever regretted having him. 



My sister: is a bitch. It started pretty mild- attacking me when I decided to become a single mother. ""You're ruining your life"", "" your kid is going to be a fucking loser"", ""you're never going to be anything but a welfare mother."" Etc. Nothing I hadn't heard before.

She blew up at my parents for helping me. She said they were ""rewarding me for being stupid and irresponsible."" Keep in mind their helping me did not affect her in any way.

My babies first Xmas I wasn't able to buy any gifts. Sister laughed and told my year- old son to ""get used to that, you're in for a lifetime of it."" She's always said fucked up, cruel shit to him, but in a cutesy way (""What a cute widdle bastard! Aunty gonna get you a tiny orange jumpsuit/ janitor kit/ lawnmower!) We don't see her except at family holidays because of this.

Today she has a degree in engineering, is married to a doctor, and they have 4 children in a big house. Collectively they have 400k in student loans. She's never let up on the snark. When I started to become fairly successful she was careful to tell me how much more I could have achieved if I had just gotten an abortion.

She's tried to teach her children that my son is a bastard, and is therefore inferior, but they all play together anyway because he's so chill.



The explosion: family reunion in Vegas last month. My sister got extremely drunk and caused a huge scene. She finally let me have it. I was pathetic, probably didn't know who the father of my child was, she had gotten 3 abortions and was proud of herself, I didn't deserve happiness because I was an idiot. She told my son that he had ruined my life, that I could have been anything if I had ""gotten rid of him"". 

We left, and came back the next morning. My parents are furious with her. She refused to apologize, even to my son. She went on to say I should close my stores, stop my business, and pull my son from his private school because I was "" perpetuating a dangerous image"" that single mothers can be successful. That she had gone to school and struggled with debt, and there was no reason that I should be so ""lucky"" to not have to deal with any of that.

We left. I explained to my son that my pregnancy was accidental, but that I had given birth to him on purpose, and that I never regretted having him. He was the reason I stopped drinking and got my shit together. We do not need a husband or a father to make our life worth living. The whole thing upset me far more than it did him- he ended up comforting me in the end, and saying he was proud of me. I couldn't possibly love this boy more.



The issue- my parents are still angry with my sister, but they want us to get together as per usual in July. I don't want to, but my parents are begging me. I can't say no to them after everything they've done for me and my kid. 

Tldr- my sister keeps insisting that I should have gotten an abortion, even though things have worked out really well for me. It's insulting. Don't want to see her in July but don't want to disappoint my parents either.

**Edit: Shit. This blew up on me. I'm debating how much more to add to this to explain why I've kept in contact with my sister at all. It's extremely complicated, and waaaaay more depressing than the little blip I put here. I can't really explain except to say that I love my sister. She's a huge cunt, but I think it's amazing she's accomplished as much as she has. I'll probably update later when I've had some time to think about it. I've read everyone's replies, and I love your butts off.**"

"My [27F] father [56M] told my brother [16M] to “man up” because he plays the flute and just obtained his first major concert solo


My brother “Jack” has been playing the flute ever since he was in fourth grade, and he’s very talented. He’s first chair in his high school’s top musical ensemble, he’s won numerous awards, etc. Although he hasn’t talked about it yet, I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants to go to college for flute performance, because it would be the perfect path for him and he would do so well. I’m very supportive of him and proud of everything that he’s accomplished so far.

On the other hand, mydad is completely against Jack playing the flute. He thinks it’s “an instrument for sissies” and that my brother should “at least play the drums or something less humiliating” (his words). He refuses to go to Jack’s concerts, drive him to his private lessons, etc. My dad played football in high school and has always talked derisively about music kids and how their activities are a huge waste of time. He’s pretty much the stereotype of the grown-up pigheaded jock, so that’s probably where his narrow-mindedness comes from. He even thinks that Jack is gay because he plays the flute, and he frequently makes comments about it. Jack has a girlfriend who he’s been dating for almost a year now, but clearly that doesn’t mean anything to my dad, who thinks Jack is just “hiding something”. 

Before my mom died about a year ago, none of this was a major problem because she was very supportive of Jack’s flute playing—she had absolutely no tolerance for my dad’s jackassery. She and my dad used to fight about it quite a bit, but my dad would always back down and shut up, and he would never make comments like he does now. But now that my mom is gone, my dad has become increasingly rude over the past few months about Jack’s flute playing to the point where even I’m starting to notice it, and I don’t even live with him anymore. The only reason I’m still in contact with my dad is because of Jack—we have a pretty good relationship. My dad doesn’t understand why I’ve grown more distant over the years, because he really likes me, but honestly, the moment Jack becomes an independent adult, I’m never talking to my dad again.

Jack has been relatively silent all this time about my dad’s terrible attitude. At first, I figured that Jack has decided to just to put up with my dad until he can move out and cut off all contact for good. However, everything changed today when Jack finally obtained his first major concert solo. The concert’s in the fall, but he needs all summer to prepare because it’s a very important solo. He was extremely excited about this, and it really showed when he ran into my dad’s house the moment he got home from school. I was there when he came home because I was going to take him to his lesson, and my dad was home too. Jack saw me first and excitedly started telling me the good news, but when my dad walked in to find out what was going on, he fell silent. My dad asked Jack what was up but cut him off as soon as he heard that it was about his flute. Then he said harshly “Man the fuck up and do something else with your life, Jack. Jesus Christ.” and left the room.

Then Jack suddenly burst into tears. It was the very first time that I had ever seen him actually react about my dad’s horrible behavior. I tried to comfort him and I called his teacher to cancel his lesson. Now he’s over at my house. He’s calmed down somewhat, but he’s still very visibly upset.

I can’t even begin to put into words how angry I am with my dad for what he said and for his overall shitty character. He's the worst person I know and if it wasn't for Jack I would no longer be in contact with him. But my question is, what can I do to help Jack? This is the first time he’s ever reacted about this whole issue. He’s not exactly a poker face, but he’s a relatively quiet kid. Now I can only imagine how much he’s been bottling up all of these hurt feelings all this time. Is there any way that I can support him besides just going to his concerts and taking him to his lessons, and giving him emotional support? I think what my dad said and how he’s been treating Jack can be seen as emotional abuse. I’m not completely sure on that (which is partly why I’m posting here), but if that’s the case, will any law authorities take me seriously if I want Jack to move in with me or something like that? Or if Jack wants to move in with me? I really want to help him and I don’t want him to have to deal with my dad any longer.

**tl;dr: my brother Jack is extremely talented at playing the flute, and although I am very supportive of him, my dad is not, to the point of possible emotional abuse. Today Jack told us that he obtained his first major concert solo, and my dad said “Man the fuck up and do something else with your life, Jack. Jesus Christ.” Jack burst into tears and he’s still very upset, and now I’m wondering what I can do to help him, possibly legally, beyond emotional support.**

*edit: I see some of you have posted advice about my brother's career future as a professional musician, and while it's nice of you to offer it, that really wasn't what I was asking for. I'm sure he knows plenty well how incredibly hard it is for someone to break into the classical music scene, and although he's never talked about it, he's definitely been talked to about it, most notably by his private lesson teacher.*"
"My [31 F] friend [25 F] doesn't think her dress for our mutual friend's [34 M] wedding is inappropriate.


So, my friend ""Becca"" is a little bit of an overzealous, super energetic puppy. One of my guy friend's originally brought her in because he's crushing on her, but she's settled in as part of the group. She's a young 25, which seems to be polarizing to the group (who are mostly in their early to mid 30s), especially to most of the women, who think she's annoying AF. She and I have always gotten along, mostly because I take her in small doses. 

So here's the deal. One of our guy friends is getting married in August. It's a Great Gatsby-style wedding, and the bride and groom have requested that all the guests dress up in 1920's style to go along with the theme. All of us LOVE themed parties, so all of us have been very excited to get decked out in full flapper gear.

Last week, I received a ranting text from my friend ""Liz"" about Becca's dress for the wedding. According to Liz, Becca bought a cream dress that's pretty fancy and could be mistaken for a low-key wedding dress. Just to remind you, Becca is **NOT** the bride. She's a guest on the groom's side. 

Liz and the other girls pointed that out to Becca, who basically freaked out at them, crying that she knows the other girls don't like her and are just picking on her. Apparently, the dress is final sale and Becca spent a lot of money on it. 

Liz also sent me a picture of the dress - it really does look like it could be a 1920's style wedding dress. 

Liz knows the bride better than the rest of us, and knows the bride would probably be pissed off if Becca showed up in a white-ish dress too. Apparently they brought that up to Becca, but she claims that most weddings now aren't so traditional, the dress is dark enough that it's more gold than cream, and that the girls will say anything 'cause they hate her. 

Liz and my other girlfriends are asking me to talk to Becca - they know she and I have a much warmer relationship and they think she'll listen to me. They don't want to go to the bride or groom yet, because they're going crazy with wedding prep and don't need this on their plate. 

I know for a fact that Becca doesn't have much spending money, and probably can't afford another dress for the wedding. She doesn't own many dresses, and none that'd fit into this theme. Also, she's very short (4'11) and busty (Gs), so it'd be near impossible to borrow something. 

So my questions are these: How do I explain the situation to Becca in a way that she doesn't feel attacked? What are some financially reasonable suggestions I can make? I honestly don't think Becca's malicious or trying to take attention from the bride - I think she genuinely thought/thinks the dress's color was/is fine. 

**EDIT**: Great Scott, this blew up! Thank you so much for all the advice. I'm reading through it all and will answer where appropriate!

**EDIT 2**: Just cause a lot of people are asking - the dress is dry clean only with TONS of beading, so I'm not sure if/how it can be dyed. I'm going to be doing research into this and calling some places for suggestions. Thank you!

"Me [24 F] with my boyfriend [28 M]; we're about to break up over a clock.


Hi everyone, not so happy to be here writing this, but here I am, writing away. 


I found myself in the most stupid predicament with my boyfriend and I am seriously considering ending it over this despite having had a great relationship for the last 3 years with seemingly no problems. 


The issue is this: every early morning around 4-5 am, he reaches over to my side of the bed to check the time on my phone. And every time he does this, it wakes me immediately up. 


I have tried talking to him about this before. I have told him to stop and that waking me up like that is very rude and disrespectful. He will stop doing it for a little while, and then he will just do it again. 


Last night was the final straw for me. He reached over, woke me up, and I told him ""No- you're not looking at my phone."" He got very angry and stormed out of bed saying how rude I was and all this nonsense. I of course couldn't fall back asleep, and stewed there for two hours wondering why my boyfriend is so inconsiderate. 


I decided not to get mad, but to just come up with an easy solution: I will buy him a clock. Easy, right? I tell him ""Look, I am going to buy a clock to put next to your bed"" and he freaks out. Keeps telling me he will just sleep on the couch or use his watch, but he can't since he doesn't have a backlight on it. And to me, sleeping on the couch is an EXTREME since we have never done that in our 3 years of being together. I know he only said it because *drama* *eye-roll*


So now I am at a complete loss because I can't make him happy. Clearly what he wants is for things to stay as they are, as in him reaching over to check the fucking clock every morning thus waking me up. This realization has quite shaken me up. He has shown he clearly doesn't care at all, and acts aggressively towards me (via email) because I want to....buy him a clock? Why is that a reason to get enraged over? 


And throughout all of this, he hasn't apologized to me once! I really feel like I deserve an apology, after all HE is the one who woke ME up- not the other way around. I would never intentionally wake someone up, to me that is just plain rude. I don't see why he can't extend the same courtesy to me, and why he is being so unreasonable about this whole thing. 


What to do?

TL;DR; My boyfriend keeps waking me up in the morning to ask for the time. I wanted to buy him a clock so it would stop, he refused. What now?

"My (31F) husband's (32M) mother (60sF) has Alzheimers. He moved her in with us and is not actively looking for a nursing home. My house is a mess and I am at my wits end.


I'm very much at the end of my rope here with this situation.

My husband's mother has alzheimers. It became evident this year that she could no longer manage to live alone without supervision. We live in a 3 bedroom house and so my husband wanted to move her into one of the spare rooms. I agreed to this only as a *temporary* solution until we found a home for her to be moved to. We had a very long discussion about this and I told him very seriously that neither of us is equipped to be her home nurse. He agreed and promised me it would be a short stay and he would begin to look at homes immediately.

It is now a month later.

My husband has not found a home. I don't even think he's been looking that hard. His mother needs to be supervised with EVERYTHING. She can't even make her own meals. I found a slice of toast in the sink because she had mistook it for a dish and tried to wash it. She almost ate canned catfood thinking it was canned ham. This forces me to prepare her meals for her. 

I work from home so between 11 am and 4 pm I am doing work on my laptop. I cannot focus on what I have to do (I translate legal documents) because she wanders into my study and starts talking to me about nothing. She thinks because I am at home and on the computer that I'm not busy. 

The house is a mess. When it was just my husband and I living here everything stayed clean and tidy. I washed the floors once a week and that was fine. Now I find myself having to clean almost every day because his mother spills things on the floor and drags in mud from our garden/yard. She is dirty and leaves dishes and cups on top of our kitchen island as if to say ""you put these away"". She doesn't flush the toilet. She leaves pieces of food out to mold. She smells sour because she forgets to bathe for days on end and I adamantly refuse to take on that task as well. My husband is the one who tells her to go bathe.

Our sex life has flatlined. He's too tired/stressed and I am too annoyed. There's always the fear she is going to just barge in too because she doesn't register anything.

I am SICK of this. My house feels like a prison. My husband is useless. All he says is ""I haven't found the right home for mom"" or if he sees her being slightly more lucid than the day before he makes excuses that she's made an improvement. Oh today she made her own toast and ate it instead of putting it in the sink. Woopee. It is beginning to feel like we will be stuck with her until she dies.

This situation is turning me into a bad person. I resent his mother now and I am ashamed to say it but I start hoping she will have an accident that lands her in the hospital so she's finally out of the house. I can't live like this anymore. Yes, I feel bad because its his mom and the only family he has left but this is not the life I signed up for. I need my house back and my peace of mind too. I want the kitchen counter to stay clean for more than a few hours and the floor to sparkle for more than a day. I want my quiet mornings back to myself. I want to take a bath and not worry how long Im taking because of what she may be doing. 

How do I approach this with my husband? I am tired of him pussyfooting around and saying ""We'll see how this week goes"" and putting it off. I need to talk to him in a way that is both sensitive and firm. Desperate for some advice.
 
**EDIT**: Oh my god you guys. I am so overwhelmed by the support and responses. I actually sat here and cried for a bit. Im sorry if I came off as angry. Theres been so much built up frustration it felt good to actually say how I feel to someone. I am talking to Mike when he gets home today. 

   
**tl;dr**: Husband's mother has alzheimers and needs to constantly be watched. I can no longer take it. Husband has not put her in a home as promised and I am tired of cleaning up after her. I need him to buckle up and just do it already."

"Grandfather [77M] announced that he's leaving everything to me [29M]. Now everyone hates me.


My grandfather has always had a very complicated relationship with everyone. He's a perfectionist and he has very high expectations. As a result, all four of his children more or less dissapointed him. He was always of the belief that a successful family empire will only be made if everyone outpeforms their father. This is more or less what happened with our family. My great grandfather of my grandfather migrated to the US with nothing and was eventually able to support his family. Grandfather of my grandfather built on that and started a small business for himself. My grandfather's father became a successful trader. My grandfather expanded the business and created a very successful company.

The problem happened when his children (my father, uncle and aunts) weren't really able to prove to him that they can take things even further. According to my grandfather, none of them were worthy successor, or worthy of the family name.

Now don't get me wrong. My grandfather is an asshole. His expectations are usually so high and he's not a very kind person. I don't share his life philosophy but I respect him a lot as a businessman and I love him.

About 7 years ago when I finished college, my grandfather offered mre and my three cousins jobs. We were all the same age give or take a few years and he thought that he should offer us a place to work if we want to. He made it clear to us that this isn't a handout, and that we'll be treated exactly like every other employee and we have to start at entry level. If we expected to go up and get promotions we had to earn them.

After about six months one of the cousins went to him and asked for a promotion or a better salary, grandfather refused. None of us got any promotions or pay bumps for two years. At that time two of the cousins left and worked somewhere else. The other one went to grandfather and told him that he wants a promotion and grandfather fired him. I never said anything about salary or promotion as I kind of knew his personality and knew that there's no chance he will listen so I kept working.

After three years he told me that he was impressed with my work and unlike my cousins I've shown that I'm a person who's willing to work hard. He said that these three years were the test and I've passed. He promoted me slowly within the company and within a year I was his right hand man. For the past three years he's been teaching me ins and outs of the business and I've been getting more and more responsibility and right now I'm running most of the business under his supervision.

Last Monday he told me how dissapointed he was with his children (again I don't agree with his assessment), and he told me that I was the son he always wanted and he's never been happier in his life than now that he thinks he's found a successor who is his flesh and blood. He told me that he wants to retire completely next year and let me to take over for him. 

I expected it to happen. That's what he's been grooming me for. What I didn't really expect was what came next. This weekend he invited everyone over to talk about inheritance and told them that he's leaving everything to me and me only. Nothing for my father or uncles and nothing for other grandchildren. I was as shocked as everyone else was.

So ever since it happened nobody is talking to me at all. Not my father. Not my sister. Not my mother. My uncle called me and accused me of playing on grandfather's feelings to scam everyone else out of their inheritance. Cousins removed me from their Facebook.

I feel like I've lost all of my family. I understand that they must be frustrated because it's a lot of money but how am I the one to blame? It's between them and their father. I didn't ask my grandfather to do this. I didn't even expect him to do this. And my grandfather is very healthy and fit and you'd expect him to live on for many more years so it's not really even an urgent matter.

How can I solve this problem? My family are not bad people. I love my parents and sister and want a relationship with them but they decided to not even talk to me. I get their frustration but is there way to come together?
   
**tl;dr**: Grandfather always saw his children as disappointments. I started working for him and he liked me a lot and now has decided to leave everything for me and nothing for his children or grandchildren. Now everyone hates me. How should I move forward?"
"Me [16M] with my two sisters [19F] [20F], duration 16 years. Our mother freaked out like crazy cause she saw me in the same bed as them. Is she totally overreacting or does she have a point?


Does she have a point?

I'm sixteen, male, my two sisters are 18 and 19.  My mother is 48, my dad is 52.

Last Saturday night, I staid up in my sister's room watching movies with the two of them.  It was really fun, we were having chips and drinks and were snuggled up in our pj's in one of my sister's beds.  When we finished the movie, it was very late, and we were all tired and it was rainy and stormy outside, not to mention it was freezing, so we thought it would be fine if we all stayed in the same bed together.

Next morning, mum saw us and freaked out like crazy.  ""What are you doing in her bed?""  She singled me out, even though the other sister was in her bed as well.  She took me out and scolded me, asking me what the hell was going on, blowing her lid off.  I told her to calm down and just explained to her the situation like everything had happened, I told her how come she wasn't fussing about my other sister sleeping in the bed as well?

She was like ""you're a boy, its different, you know boys have erections, bla bla bla"".  I told her just stop, she was overreacting it was no big deal.  I didn't want to tell my dad, I thought it would be embarrassing, but I feel he'd agree its no big deal.

I explained my situation to her, it was a cold night, we were enjoying our time together watching a movie, it was really warm and comfy for the three of us to snuggle up in bed together, what's the problem?

My sisters and I laughed at the whole thing, but my mother still insists it was wrong. I feel she might react the same way if it happens again, even though I like sleeping in bed with them because it was really warm, comfortable and nice.

Is she right to freak out or is she overreacting? Did she even have a point with what she said? Should we just refrain from it in the future?

My mother [51 F] was furious and promptly kicked me [17 M] out of the house to live with them. I feel like a burden and don't know what else I can do.


My brother and mother don't get along, they actually don't even speak to each other anymore. My mom is a very rude and narcissistic and borderline racist person who actively spoke out against my brother's now wife who is of a different race.

They have I guess gone no contact? I don't know the proper term but it was so bad that my mother and her side of the wasn't invited to the wedding 3 years ago (although it was only a small ceremony). I was younger at the time but I didn't really understand, I hate my brother for what he did.

I play sports in high school and last winter I torn my ACL, my mom who thinks sports in high school are a waste refused to pay for the surgery that I ultimately needed if I ever wanted to continue playing sports at 100% basically told me to go with physical therapy because it was cheaper. My parents both make great money and lavishly gamble hundreds if not thousands every other weekend in casinos. 

When my brother found out about the what happened he immediately offered to pay for it, saying that he believed sports in high school were important and that just as an overall quality of life thing. My mom was furious with me and 2 months after my surgery (she had been ignoring/guilt-tripping me since) basically kicked me out to live with them.

My brother and his wife Mia took me into their home with no questions asked, they both knew how my mom could be. I've been living with them for about 3 months now and I'm starting to feel like a burden. While they both do have really nice jobs they have been basically supporting themselves, along with me and Mia's younger sister Lily (She lives with them to be within a certain school district). They are paying for all my medical bills, food, transportation, school related things basically everything, on top of paying for their new house.

My brother and Mia both tell me just focus on my well-being that they have more than enough to support me and her sister and I should just be looking forward to playing sports again, applying to colleges and doing well in school. But, I overheard them talking in their room a few days ago about how they were ultimately going to put off having kids and that they cancelled their overseas trip to visit Mia's relatives in order to take care of us and I've felt sick to my stomach ever since.  

My parents don't want me back, I've tried reaching out to my mother and she basically told me off for going against her. My brother and wife are telling me just to focus on myself and not worry about them but I can't stop thinking about all the trouble I'm causing them.

I feel even more horrible because they are doing all of this for me but when they didn't invite my mother to their wedding I felt so bitter and distance toward them. I was 14 at the time but I vividly remember lashing out trying to protect her and my brother just smiling and tell me that he'd still be there for me and that some day I'd understand. I hate myself for that and even after 3 years and endless apologizes I always find myself feeling guilty about it which isn't helping me accept their kindness.

I know there probably isn't much advice you can give or if this is even the right place to post but I'm at a lost. 

My friends don't understand my issue. I feel so hopeless and I don't want to drag my down my brother and his wife any longer than I have to. 

Am I looking at this or thinking about this the wrong way?

I don't know how to cope with this.

**TL;DR:** My parents kicked me out after my brother and his wife fronted the bill for my knee surgery so that I could continue playing high school sports and as a quality of life improvement.  I've been living with them for a few months and a few days ago I overheard talking about how they are going to be putting off having kids and cancelling their oversea trip to visit brother's wife's relatives.

"UPDATE: Me (28F) with boyfriend (29M) of 8 months, Boyfriend's mother is pressuring me to get an abortion


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jb3o4/me_28f_with_boyfriend_29m_of_8_months_boyfriends/

Thank you to all who commented. I never expected so much support from reddit, but I truly appreciate it and your advice really helped me decide what to do.

After I posted on here my boyfriend and I spent the next few days arguing non-stop. I saw another conversation he had with his mother where she was telling him that I wasn't being fair to him by wanting to keep the baby, that I was ruining his life, and that he needed to get out now. I was absolutely disgusted, but I came to the realization that I wanted this baby and would not be able to live with myself if I got an abortion.

I didn't expect my boyfriend to be supportive given his previous reaction and the influence from his mother, so I made the decision to keep the baby knowing there was a high likelihood that I would end up being a single mother. I was fully prepared to tell my boyfriend I was keeping the baby, pack my bags, and leave.

I decided to stay home from work one day to tell him because I knew it would be emotional and I knew I probably wouldn't get a reaction I liked. Before I told him my final decision he had an appointment with a family therapist that he had been seeing with his mother and father. I feared that this would only be an opportunity for his mother to further pressure him to leave me if I didn't get an abortion, so I wasn't thrilled about the timing.

When he got home he texted me to come outside. My heart was racing and I had a feeling this wasn't going to be good.

I was so wrong. As soon as I walked outside I saw him down on one knee and I'm pretty sure my heart stopped beating. He told me that when he found out I was pregnant he was overjoyed, but his fears have been overpowering him, and like I imagined his mother has been making it worse by magnifying all of his fears. He said that in therapy a lot of emotions came out and he realized that despite his fears he knew he wanted me to keep this baby. And then he proposed!

I said yes and I was so overjoyed I honestly don't think I've ever been so happy/relieved in my life. I knew I was keeping this baby anyways, but I am so happy to have him by my side through it.

I talked to my boyfriend about his mother, because her behavior was still as issue to me. The fact that she said ""oh please make sure she takes those abortion pills, please"" still disgusts me. I ended up having a conversation with the two of them. She told me she never wanted me to get an abortion to begin with, but her son is her whole world and she just wants him to be happy, so when she thought I was keeping the baby against his will she became very over-protective of him and wanted to make sure he was happy above all else. I guess I understand that, but still, a lot of what she said was really inappropriate. In the end she actually started crying tears of joy and said she has always wanted to be a grandmother and is so excited. She told me if she is ever overbearing or inappropriate in the future to call her out on it.

In the end I still have worries about how my boyfriend's mother will behave in the future, but she seems conscious of her behavior and willing to work on it. I really couldn't be happier.

TL;DR; Boyfriend's mother had been pressuring me to get an abortion because she though that is what would make her son happy. Boyfriend and his mother went to therapy, a lot of emotions came out, and he ended up realizing he wants this baby and that his fears were getting the best of him. We are now engaged and his mother is excited about becoming a grandmother."
"My [24/f] boyfriend [29/m] just met my severely disabled brother. He ignored him the whole time. I'm considering breaking up with him but don't know if I'm being too harsh.



My boyfriend, Aaron, and I have been together for 11 months. We get along really well and I feel like we’re (up until recently) on the right track. I care about him a lot and we share a lot of the same interests.
 
I have a younger brother, Christian, who is 21. He has a severe case of Autism among other disorders. Christian lacks motor skills and is often difficult to understand. For most, it’s uncomfortable to be around him, as he has sudden outbursts and can have fits. My parents have made the best of the situation and about 2 years ago, they put him into a facility about an hour away to get the best care he can get. It was difficult for all of us but we all manage to visit him at least 3 times a week. My mom also works part-time so she can be with him more. Christian comes home a couple weekends a month. My brother and I are pretty close. I seem to have a way with him and can calm him down pretty quickly.
 
Aaron is aware of my brother. I mentioned him on our first date and haven’t been shy about his disabilities. Christian is often in Instagram posts. There are photos and videos, so it’s not like I hide it. Aaron has met my parents and has spent some time with them. He hadn’t met Christian up until about a month ago. My parents were having a party and brought him home to see our whole family. I told Aaron that Christian would be there and that he was very excited to meet Aaron (Christian loves people). Aaron seemed ok with this and he “couldn’t wait to meet him.”
 
When we got to my parents’ house, Aaron and Christian met. It seemed fine but then, Aaron refused to acknowledge Christian. Christian would try to get his attention and Aaron would pretend he didn’t hear or look the other way. He did this for about 4 hours and finally Christian started getting upset. Now, Christian can’t vocalize his feelings that well but I’m pretty sure this was the reason for that fit. We left about an hour later. I know my parents noticed Aaron’s behavior.
 
I asked Aaron if he was uncomfortable and he said no. I then brought up how he would ignore him. He said that he didn’t mean to but there was just a lot going on. I can understand this. People are often uncomfortable around people with special needs. I told him that it really upset Christian and it would mean a lot if he could maybe give him a little bit more attention next time. I know he can’t understand him but just nodding his head can make Christian smile. Christian won’t be infatuated with Aaron for long. It usually takes about 2 or 3 social situations for Christian to move on to a new person. Aaron felt that he didn’t do anything wrong. He keeps insisting that he’s not and I “should just drop it.” 
Fine- I dropped it.
 
Now, what I have a problem with is that Aaron refuses to go anywhere my parents of Christian might be. He’ll make up an excuse that he’s tired or needs to do some work at home. I’ve invited him on 5 separate occasions since the party. I’ve expressed that it would mean a lot to me.  
 
I want to be with someone who accepts my brother. I know he comes with a lot of needs but I don’t feel I’m asking too much. If he’s uncomfortable, I understand, but he needs to be honest. I just don’t know if I can be with someone who won’t make the effort. Everything seemed fine up until the party.
 
Any thoughts? Am I being too harsh? Is there a better way for me to approach this with Aaron?

EDIT: I've been told this is important and should be added: Aaron was well aware of everything. We even spent the night before going over best ways to interact, what to do when a certain incident happens, how to speak to him, etc. I've even shown him videos of me calming him down just in case he would ever need to. 
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend just met my disabled brother. He ignored him the entire time. Now he refuses to go anywhere my brother might be. I know it's uncomfortable but he won't be honest with me. I don't know if I can be with him. "

Thanks for all the suggestions on my post yesterday.  There were a lot of good suggestions and I appreciate the support.  My wife and I told my parents last night at dinner and they were thrilled for us.  We discussed how to tell my brother and SIL and decided it would be best if I called him personally and ask him the best way to let my SIL know.  I called and told my brother I had a question to ask him and said ""how do you feel about being an uncle?"".  His reaction was very positive and he seemed quite excited.  I tried to begin to ask how I should tell his wife but before I could he shouted over to her ""hey [OP's SIL] they're having a baby!"".  I could hear her shout excitedly in the background and wish us congratulations.  We chatted for a couple minutes and he joked ""so I guess you won't be coming to visit us for Christmas this year?"" (baby is due 12/30) and all was good.

"Mom [40F] treats me [15F] better than my brother [14M] because I am thin


Other post: https://ut.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jw8su/mom_40f_treats_me_15f_better_than_my_brother_14m/

Im 15F. My brother [14M] is getting teased by Mom [40] for liking anime and things like Ben10. He is overweight and not very popular, so she is always saying he needs to be better. She tries to compare us but I tell her no, she cant because I love him and think he is cool. I let him hang out with my friends and they like him a lot.
She says it's okay when I like it. She says I am cooler and my brother is kind of a losers to her. How do I make my brother feel loved and make her understand my brother is cool too? And make the comments stop? **TL;DR Mom has double standard about what I do and what my brother does.**

Update:

i talked to my brother [14M] and showed him the post. He told me that he has been talking to our aunt Kat [39F] and she actually showed up. Aunt Kat took my Mom [40F] aside and they had a huge fight. I could hear them from my room they were so loud. This was like the day after I made the post. The fight was mostly about how Mom used to be fat and how grandma treated them growing up. 

Mom left for a few hours and then came home, apologized. My brother told Mom her apology is not accepted and that until she changed he wasn't going to have a relationship with her. I told my Mom the same thing. I said that she had hurt me as well as brother, because she could have ruined our relationship and made us both feel like we were wrong. I said it was wrong to make me feel like I was better because I was thin and that is how people get eating disorders [like someone suggested in a message to me.] 

My brother admitted he has been skipping lunch because of what she has said and that he doesn't like himself. Mom cried and tried to hug him, he locked himself in his room. I told mom that he cried himself to sleep sometimes because of her and what she had done was abusive. Then I showed her the post and told her she needed to think about who she had become. 

Mom hasn't been talking to us much. She goes to work, comes home, goes into her room. Aunt Kat has been taking care of us, going to work and then spending the night. Dad is supposed to come back in another week, for a few days, then he is heading back. I talked to him on the phone about what happened and he said that he is going to talk with Mom about it. He has been talking with Aunt Kat [who is Mom's sister] and she's staying until he gets here. 

He has agreed to get us to a therapist and to make sure Mom knows that this is serious. I don't think Dad knew how serious this was until brother talked to him on the phone about it. Dad asked to talk to Mom and there was more fighting. I am not sure what is going to happen, but things are looking better. My brother is smiling more and we have been watching anime and tv with my aunt. 

So thank you for everyone who helped me out. I think it is getting better. 

**TL;DR** My aunt showed up and is staying with. Brother has been talking to mom, she seems to get it now. Dad coming home and we are getting therapy."
"Me [24F] with my BF [26M] 4 years, thinking about breaking up because of his reaction to his SIL [35F] wanting a hysterectomy.


[removed]"
"I'm a gay guy [23M] and I'm annoyed with my friend [21F] telling me she's ""not getting married until everyone can get married"".


I’m having some issues with a friend, and wanted some objective advice.


So this friend (Isabelle) and I met through college. We are not close (never hung out the two of us) but are friendly. Like the same  TV shows and all of that. We are also part of a language group together. 


A few months ago Isabelle got engaged. She was very excited and our group of friends were excited for her. She was upfront and told us that her and her fiancé (Zack) were planning on having basically just family at their wedding, as they both come from HUGE families and with both sides combined they are already looking at upwards of 80+ people. It was clear that her college friends were not invited to the wedding. That was cool by everyone; weddings are hella expensive and I absolutely don’t feel close enough to her to be invited. She did, however, invite us all to the engagement party. Cool, free booze and a chance to celebrate with her! I thought this was a great compromise. 


In the invites, Isabelle and Zack asked people not to bring gifts, but instead asked if everyone could give them a monetary gift so they could finance their wedding. Isabelle also contacted our college friend group, asking if we could come and reilliterating that they would be accepting cash. I texted her saying I could go and was looking forward to it. She replied, saying that was great news and that they would love a monetary contribution.  


At this point I was a bit irked. We’re all pretty young (18-24) and still studying full time. I felt frustrated that I was being hit up for money THREE TIMES for a wedding I wasn’t even invited to. I also felt like, if you can’t afford a wedding, is it necessary to have one while you’re a student? But whatever, it is her choice and she’s a pal. I chipped in like $50 and called it a day; the party was on a boat (!?) and was really fun, a huge rager. I thought that was it. Enjoy your wedding, Isabelle. 


It wasn’t it. Came back to my phone after it being turned off all day after I’d been hiking with my boyfriend. I’d been tagged in a photo on instagram by Isabelle, and also was tagged in something she shared on my wall. There were lots of notifications about comments and likes. I open them up – she’s used my photo (plus a bunch of other people’s) to make a collage or some shit, on both instagram and facebook. In the descriptor, she has written a long post about how gay marriage isn’t legal in our country, and she and Zack are going to wait until it is legal until they themselves tie the knot. The people’s photos she used were all her gay friends. This was made clear in the comment below that Isabelle had written, saying something like, “until all these great people can get married, we’re just not interested”. I was explicitly tagged and it was shared around. Everyone was commenting what a great person she was and how ""brave"" she was being.  


I’m fucking livid. Number one, I know I can’t get married here. Everyone knows gay people can’t get married here. You don’t need to tell me again, I know me and my partner don’t have that option here right now and it breaks my heart. I don’t want to be reminded any more than what I have to be.  Number two, are you fucking serious tagging me on two social media platforms? I consider myself “out” and am not trying to actively hide my sexuality from anyone, but it’s just not necessary that all my friends/all her friends/all the friends of all the other gay people she tagged know that I’m gay. Three, what was the donations for then if you aren’t getting married??? What was the point? Zack thanked his parents for organizing and funding the engagement party, I know all of it was his folks “wedding gift” to them. It's gross how everyone is making her out to be this great person too, but not getting married will do literally nothing for the gay cause.


I untagged myself straight away, but it had been up for hours. I keep thinking about it. I guess I have a chip on my shoulder, because I feel like she’s wanting to get praised but I have no idea who she thinks she’s helping by not getting married. I also feel its pretty transparent tagging everyone she knows who is gay – sort of like saying, “how can I be racist?? Look at all these black people I know!” 


What do you think reddit? Was she out of line? Or am I letting my feelings around gay marriage cloud my judgment?


TL;DR: Friend got engaged, hit us all up for money. Month later, she tags me and a bunch of other gay peeps on social media and declares she isn’t getting married until we can all get married too. Super irritated, want to know if I’m being a tool or not.

"My [20sF] mother [50sF] was watching my dog until I could bring him with me and she took him to the shelter and didn't tell me until over 1 day later.


**I am eternally grateful for all the support I have received on here and the endless PMs I am getting offering me help. It's wonderful and reassuring that most people reading this understand me and want to offer help opposed to insults. Some stuff has gone down and I will be posting an update after this is resolved. And for those wondering, the pupper is safe. :')** 

My mother is not a good mother, she has plenty of issues including some health issues such as dementia. She also has a ton of stress due to working 2 jobs because she is an immigrant without any formal education, both her jobs are minimum wage. I am a college student, first generation, but had to take time off of school when we lost our house. I spent 3 semesters out of school, living at home, working, and helping her with bills, housework, things like that. 
During my time off, I became depressed. I felt awful not being in school, working towards my future. I didn't want to continue the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. I also couldn't deal with her instability anymore, I needed better for myself. I helped her for a while because she's my mom and I love her, and she is unfortunately the only family I have.

Last year during my time off, my boyfriend got me a dog because of my depression. I quickly fell in love with my little guy and he made all the difficult aspects of my life feel better. I took care of him, trained him myself, paid for all his vet bills, his toys, and bed. The only things my mom paid for sometimes was his food, which she didn't mind doing when she could afford it. 

After the fall semester past, I returned to school for spring semester. I lived in a dorm and my dog stayed at home with my mom. My plan was to get an apartment after the semester ended, and I did. Unfortunately it was difficult for me to find and it has a $575 pet deposit. So my dog had to stay at home for at least the summer before coming to live with me in the fall, so I could save up my minimum wage money to be able to bring him here with me. 

On the phone yesterday, when calling me to ask me to do something for her, my mom throws in as a side note that she also gave my dog to the animal shelter the day before. Like it's an afterthought. She had an episode on Wednesday and brought him there. I had no idea something like this could happen. My mom has done some awful things, but she was on board with watching him until I could take him by the end of the summer. What I need help with here are a couple different things: 

How to cut toxic parents out of your life when they are reliant on you to do so many things? My biggest issue with what she did was that she didn't even tell me until over a day later, giving me no option to find another place for him. And that she had no caring in her voice when she told me. And does anyone know of any subreddit that might help me find affordable boarding for my dog, or a website? I cannot afford much. 

tl;dr - My mom was watching my dog until I could pay the pet deposit for him to move in with me. She took him to the shelter during an episode and didn't tell me about it until over a day later. I need to get rid of my toxic parent and I need to find any possible solutions to help me keep my dog. 

**Edit - I am in the Chicago land area in case anyone knows a potential boarding place that could be affordable. Or any other options. The dog is a border collie.**

**Edit #2 - my mom has a roommate, she got a roommate after I moved out. She's not in an awful financial situation, she works that much because she's saving. When my father passed away, we were in a bad position. This is when I was in high school. The roommate also helps care for him. She is not alone in it. The roommate likes him.**"
"Me [36 M] with my wife [29 F] of two years, did she intend not to invite me on a vacation trip?


OP here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k0ws8/me_36_m_with_my_wife_29_f_of_two_years_did_she/

I sat her down and told her that if she wanted to go alone, I understood if she wanted girl's time. She smiled at me and told me I was her nerd, that of course she wanted me to come. When she initially accepted her friend's invitation, she got excited and forgot to invite me because they are going to Harry Potter World, so my wife was geeking out and forgot about me. When she did think about me, she thought I seemed disinterested in it, remembered that I'm not a big sun/outdoors person, and figured she'd go alone (she goes on trips frequently because she is very popular with her friend group.)

I was sad because it was going to take her away from me for a weekend because I am gone Monday-Friday for work. We are best friends, talk multiple times a day, and she goes with me sometimes. We are happy, but the thought of losing her for the two days a week we can be together was an awful feeling. I would've been okay, it would've just sucked. 

So, she was pleasantly surprised when I wanted to come! We've made plans for the way down, she's happy she doesn't have to drive the whole way, and we will have a full week at home together after, because I took my second week of vacation.
   
**tl;dr**: My wife had a temporary memory charm placed on her at the words ""Harry Potter World"" and then just thought I'd be miserable. We're both excited!"
"UPDATE: My (33M) wife (30F) and I moved across the country for her job. Things haven't worked out for me, and I'm pretty sure she's sleeping with someone at work. I think I'm stuck in this situation because I can't afford living on my own.


Original Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k3si2/my_33m_wife_30f_and_i_moved_across_the_country/

Hey guys, sorry for dropping off the face of the planet in the other thread.  I had an initial consultation with an attorney in Petaluma last Friday afternoon and after he dropped a few bombs on me (mostly good ones, a few bad ones), I decided to disconnect and took a few nights to myself in Yosemite this past weekend.  I really badly needed to clear my head and stuff.

I have another meeting with my attorney coming up soon but right now the jist is this will probably work out okay for me financially.  Depending on how that comes out, I'll have a number of options, and mayyybe staying in the SF area will be possible if I'm able to find a gig in the upcoming months.  If not, I'm looking at Sacramento, LA, or even back home to Atlanta.  I really have no idea yet, it seems like everything is out of my hands and more or less in the hands of my attorney and my wife's eventual attorney.   But from what mine has said I can at least expect to be fine for the foreseeable future once the shit hits the fan.

I have not confronted my wife about it yet.  When I told her I was taking the weekend camping, she didn't seem to care.  More time for her to spend with her bigshot investor boyfriend I guess.  I just don't care either at this point.  I don't want to start that drama until she gets served papers or whatever.  I just don't have the energy for it at this point.  Plus honestly I want to see if I can find more concrete evidence of her and her new man before I ""officially"" put it out there that I know and that I'm done with her.  Judging from the condoms I found in the house that aren't mine this morning, I probably have enough for now.

The hard part about all of this is going to be moving on.  I'm not so worried about the money anymore given what I know now, but I'm afraid I'm not going to be doing well personally.  It took getting to Yosemite Valley to not be consumed with self hatred or thoughts of ending it all (don't worry, I'm not going there), but I really don't have a lot of confidence in myself in the road ahead.  I've got no friends, no prospects, no lady friend, no nothing.  It sucks.

Anyways just wanted to get this out there, you guys had some great advice and helped get my ass to a lawyer, you made the right call and put me on the right path, I really appreciate it.
   
**tl;dr**: Recently discovered my wife was seeing another man, I was afraid I couldn't afford splitting.  Turns out after seeing a lawyer I can, but the road ahead is still going to be lonely and sucky."
"Me (26M) not wanting to let my sister(31F)and kids (3m)and(2m) move in with me despite pressure from family.


Right I'm not sure how to deal with this figure I would ask here.

So about 6 months ago I was able to purchase a house, I got the house for a steal due to the fact when it came to the attention of the owners who was buying it (long time family friend) they gave me a giant discout because they really didn't need the money. So I have 4 bedroom 3 bathroom house, I rent out 3 of those rooms which allows me to not work and attend school without going into debt.

Now the issue is my sister who I do care about but she does not make good descisions at all. She is currently pregnant with her third child and has just lost her job and is about to be homeless due to her bad choices and the fact that when she has a job never shows up on time. My mother has been trying to subtly hint that I should let her and the kids move in with me, which I don't want to deal with period. Most of my money comes from renting out parts of my house ontop of the fact that my sister has a bad habbit of moving in with family and staying there until they kick her out due to her just being a leech financially or due to her stealing things to buy drugs or things like that. 

I know my mom is pushing this cause she doesn't want to take care of my sister and her kids but that isn't my problem I have been out of the military for less than a year and do not want to end up going into debt supporting her and her bad choices.

I've been getting texts from parts of the family that I don't see outside of an occasionaly family get together about how lucky I am to own my own home at my age and should share that good fortune with family. That really bites on me because I spent 8 years active duty and spent 4 of those years deployed which earned me the money I used to buy my house. I didn't make terrible choices to end up with kids and not show up to work ever causing me to be fired.

I'm just really unsure how much more than me saying I can't afford to live if I evict my tenets out of my house let alone support 3 children and my sister. My father is on my side supporting me in saying no but everyone else in the family is trying to get me to let her move in I am just unsure of how else I can go about this without ruining every relationship I have with my family.

TLDR: Sister just lost her job with her 3rd kid on the way, due to me owning a nice sized house Mom and most of family trying to pressure me into letting her and kids move in. Do Not Want, how to deal with this tactfully."

I confronted her and she said she made it with a friend who just had a rough breakup, but that she hasnt been on since she made it on Thursday night.

"UPDATE: Me [32 F] with my Husband [33 M] 5 Years, Fired three times in a year; I think he's the problem.


Original Post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gfup4/me_32_f_with_my_husband_33_m_5_years_fired_three/)


Hey Reddit. I got an inbox full of requests for an update, and my original post got a lot more attention than I thought it would, so I figured I would post an update.



Unfortunately, my update is a sad one. We are going on week 5 of my husband's unemployment and he still has no job offers. He has had several prospects, quite a few phone interviews and exactly one in-person interview. As of right now, it's not looking like he will be back to work even in the next few weeks, despite having promised me every week for the last three weeks that he would have a job offer.



If he doesn't have a job offer before Wednesday, we will lose the house. To try and prepare for this, we filled out a bunch of rental applications because we have to be out of the house we are currently living in in less than three weeks. All of our applications were denied as my husband HAS NO INCOME. So it looks like we will be living in someone's basement in short order.



Several people mentioned me going back to work full-time and sadly, that is not an option. My company isn't in a position to make me a full-time offer and won't be until mid-summer (I've had this conversation with my boss). My job offer is contingent upon my continued studies, so school isn't something I can just drop right now. 



Based on the advice I received here as well as from a close friend, I have tried to approach him several times about what the problem could be, or how we might try a different way of figuring this out. Every single time, I was met with being accused of stressing him out, making him anxious and eventually, getting blamed for being the source of his nervousness (which he later said affected how his phone interviews went). 



I have asked if he has followed up regarding certain opportunities and he tells me I am making him anxious asking for updates so often. Yesterday, in fact, he told me that no one gets a job by following up with recruiters. Hmm.



I understand how recruitment works, but I have to ask myself how someone can dedicate the hours of 9-5 to getting a job in a highly in demand field in an area that has jobs aplenty and still come up short. ONE in-person interview? I've asked him to forgo applications on websites and reach out to these hiring managers in person. Or on LinkedIn. Or anything but the conventional means of being hired. Nope.  



Probably the most infuriating thing that has happened has been a warm lead on a opportunity. The COO of a small company reached out to him regarding a job that was a job title below the job he was working at previously. He was recommended to this COO by a former co-worker of my husbands, who works at the company currently. 



In the course of a month, she reached out to him 6 different times by email. He never replied to a single one of her emails. Not even a ""thanks so much for considering me"" type thing. He told me he didn't respond to her because he didn't have to.  And that he checked them out on Glassdoor and the reviews say it is a bad place to work and that they pay below market rates, so it would be a waste of his time. 



At this juncture, I am not sure what to do about my marriage. I am having a hard time focusing on work and/or school right now, I am eating everything in sight and I am trying to pack up a house that we are going to end up putting into a storage unit and I have had actual nervous breakdowns three times in the last two weeks.  That, and the neighborhood gossips have caught wind of our hard times and now that there is blood in the water, they are circling. 



I don't want to break up my family, but I don't want to be married to someone I can't rely on anymore. Even if he did save the day and get a job in the next week or so, we could be in the same position in the not so distant future. I've already told him I'd like to go back to counseling as soon as we have access to the funds, or benefits, or both and he has agreed, but I have no idea if this arrogant, entitled attitude towards work is something that is so deeply ingrained that it can't be worked out.



I've had enough instability in my life and I kept hoping that my marriage and our family would continue to be a source of stability and it is not.  I had more stability when I was on my own. It is a sad day when the saying ""the only person you can count on is yourself"" really rings true.



**tl;dr**: Husband is still jobless, we're days away from losing our home, and he still hasn't learned a damn thing from this whole process. Still not sure what I am going to do about my marriage.

"[UPDATE] Me [31 M] with my partner of 5 years [31 F] had sex only twice this year.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4gdqnu/me_31_m_with_my_partner_of_5_years_31_f_had_sex/

It has been nearly a month since my original OP so I thought I will give you guys an update. As many people have said it I sat down with my partner and we have spoken about the problem in the relationship. I have explain that I feel unloved and despite her reassurances about her love to me her actions contradict it every time. I have explain that it is not just me wanting sex but all the other aspects that comes with intimacy and that I want to feel like she looks at me as a handsome man she once fall in love with and all that ruins my self confidence and makes me feel miserable. 

Effect sadly was as I expected she said problem is only in my head, she said that she loves me and said I have unreasonable expectations about relationship with kids. 

To all that I explain once again that my problem is our problem and we must address it as a couple I offered couple counseling and finding more time to build up relationship. She again responded that she is not going to counselling because there is no problem and everything is normal so there is absolutely no reason to go to it. I suggested that maybe we go to one so if there is no problem they can tell me why do I feel that way. She said I can go on my own if I must. 

I cannot fix this relationship, unfortunately once passionate woman that I have fallen in love with is gone and in here place there is a person who doesn't care enough about to even go once with me to something that is very impotent to me and makes my life living hell.  

I am in a process of researching and finding the best way to leave that will ensure I can have as much influence with my children care and custody as possible and protect me financially to some degree.

I am devastated but there is only so many last chances, final talks and decision times one can give before he looks ridiculous. Time to move on

**tl;dr**: At some point final warning needs to be final. I'm leaving. In the process of organizing lawyers and all necessary information I need to know. "
"My Fiancée [25 F] has slowly over the years been developing unrealistic working habits. Despite my[25 M] efforts to talk some sense into her, no progress has been made. I think MIL [50 F] and my own family have a lot to do with it.


I met Laura 6 years ago we when were freshman in college. She was a highly motivated and hard working person, extremely smart, caring and funny and just overall a great person to be around. When we started dating she motivated me to really push myself through college.

The 3 years after we graduated things started to change, I found a great IT job and she struggled for a bit before landing a travel position in her field. Within the first two years of working I had increased my salary through promotions and certification by almost 50% that's about the time we got engaged. Laura hated her job and asked if she could  quit while she looked for something else. 

I was against it initially, I asked her if she could just swap to part-time (20~32 hours per week) instead we were already renting and though my salary had increased significantly I wanted to continue saving money so they we could purchase our first home together. She threw a fit and went to her parents where her mom was completely against me, saying that I should support her daughter and that I made more than enough to support her until she found a job.

It should be noted that her mom doesn't work and her family isn't well off, they actually struggle. Her dad works but for whatever reason her mom stopped working after she had Laura and never went back to the workforce despite her father not making enough.

I tried to hold firm and after some research found that her employer offered PRN positions (4~20 hours per week) with increased pay basically a work as needed position. She didn't want that either, when my parents came over one day she talked to my mom about it who seemed to side with her as well. My mom is a stay at home mom because my dad makes so much and allows it.

Eventually I doubted myself (Maybe I was being insensitive?) and let her quit her job to look for another one. I initially increased my own hours from 40 hours as a week to 50-55 hours a week just to offset the reduced incoming. 6 Months go by with no new job in sight and I asked her if she could take over a few more chores, I tried to be understanding but working 11 hours a day and then coming home to have to clean up &amp; cook was really taking it's toll.

The new chores thing was hit or miss, some weeks she did and other weeks she didn't. She gets to the 12 months of unemployed stage and we have a serious talk, I tell her I can keep up this work style for another year and that I already have a new position in the works for myself for better pay, closer commute and more experience. I think telling her this was a mistake because now she has this idea that I'm going to support us both for even longer while she tries to find a job.

I thought maybe her resume needed some tweaking so one day she ask me to take a look at it for her. I get on her computer to update it and immediately realize after logging into her job search that in the past 12 months she has only applied to 12 positions. In comparison when we graduated I put in 180 applications in a 3 month period, and she put in 90 respectively.

I brought it up and she said there aren't many jobs out there right now, she tells me her and her best friend (College dropout) are looking into the idea of doing something like Streaming / YT. I express my concerns tell her maybe working part-time while doing that would be best. My mom and her mom think that I should just commit to 100% supporting her but I don't want to do that. Her dad tells me not to let her become like her mother but I think it's already too late.

I don't know what I can really do, except give an ultimatum or just leave. I still love her and she is a great person outside of the whole job thing. I want to support her but I fear she might never change back to the girl I met. 

The wedding has been postponed (Previously set for June 6/4/16 to 7/2/16) due to my demanding work related training which has me traveling. 

Am I being selfish or unreasonable?

Thoughts?

**TL;DR:** After my success in the workplace, my girlfriend quits her job to look for another one despite my wishes for her to work part-time. It's been a year and she shows no signs of a new job in sight, she's gotten lazy around the house and hasn't been applying as frequently as she should. Our mothers (Both stay at home moms) think I should stop being selfish and just 100% commit to supporting her for as long as she needs. While her dad doesn't want me to let her turn out like her mother."
"Last night my (26m) GF (30f) and her friends (20s/30s) staged an incredibly cruel, scary and embarrassing trick on me (basically I thought I was getting beat by a street gang). Is there any coming back from this?


Edit: I just talked to her for the first time since Friday night. She lead the conversation off with ""I had such an amazing time last night, I was so bummed you didn't come out"" which kind of made me feel good that she missed me. I then got my courage up and said something like ""what you did on Friday really made me afraid and I don't think it was funny at all."" She replied that I should grow up and learn to take a joke. In my head I just kept repeating over and over and over ""break up with her, break up with her, break  up with her"" but nothing came out. Shen then coolly asked ""so are we over that?"" and I think I said ""I guess. I don't know"" (which is a massive mixed message I know) and she said ""Awesome, so-and-so is having a pool party today, do you want to come?"" and then I said I would go for a while. So now I feel even worse because I didn't even stick up for myself and she'll be over here in an hour to pick me up and hang out with even more of her friends. I know what I need to do but just don't even know how and I can't do it today in front of her friends for obvious reasons. 

Edit 2: I just broke up with her when she came to pick me up. I feel like shit but it's the right thing to do. I feel lonely and even lonlier at the anticipation of how lonely I'm going to be in an a few days and weeks.nshe didn't even really care and it sucks even more because she's going to a party and will provably joom up and I will be alone for a long time.

Original before edit:

I've been with ""Penny"" for about a year. For the most part she is really cool and we have a quite a bit of fun together. I don't know if she is my ""one"" but thats kind of what year long relationships are for and I figure as long as we get along...I can go with it. I don't have a whole lot of experience with girls, she is the 5th girl I've ever kissed and the first I've ever had sex with so I'm kind of like if things don't work with her I know it will be a while before I get another girlfriend. 

Penny is a little older than me and a lot more social, meaning she has way more friends than I do which is cool. I'm kind of introverted and I am super happy to stay at home and play video games or read while she goes out and has fun. She is friends with EVERY ""type"" of person there is so it's not weird to see her run up and hug a biker that her dad was friends with just like its not weird to see her run up and hug her female college professor from 10 years ago. 

Last night I felt a bit like going out and she was more than up for it of course. We went to a bar in the downtown area and as usual it seemed she knew 3/4 of the people in there and she was having a ball. I was quiet but I was enjoying myself. We'd been there about two hours and I went outside to burn one. Next thing I know three HUGE gangster like guys kind of encircled me and said ""you think it's smart to fuck with the Van Burens?"" (I know now this is part of the joke now but had no idea at the time). I said ""I'm sorry, this is my first time here."" One guy pushed me into the another who kind of grabbed both my arms and restrained me so I couldn't move basically. The other got in my face and said something like ""we gave you enough time and you decided to shit on my face Brad."" I was fucking so scared and didn't really say anything. He said more and more and was literally so close I could feel his spittle landing on my face. I was still in eye shot of the bouncer and said something like ""hey man please help me"" and the bouncer said ""I'm not paid enough to get involved with Van Burens"" and kind of snickered. I tried to explain I had no idea what they were talking about and that I never go out and I don't do any drugs. Then they started accusing me of being racist because I assumed they were on drugs then a small crowd started to gather and I was terrified because no one seemed to be stepping in. I literally felt like I was going to piss my pants but thank god I didn't. 

All of the sudden Penny popped out from behind the door laughing her ass off. The guy let me go and then the bouncer started laughing and the small crowd kind of gasped like ""WTF is going on."" Then Penny was like ""we got you so GOOOD!!! you looked like you were going to crap yourself."" She then introduced me to her friends that she knew from wherever the hell it was and they still acted like I was some sort of idiot for being scared of seeming like I was going to get killed over something I had no idea what it was. 

I tried my best to hang out and make light of the situation but I was REALLY ready to go home. On the way home I asked her why she did that and she said that she didn't even think it would go anywhere  because the ""Van Buren"" thing is such an obvious joke from Seinfeld that I would see it was a joke right away but her friends got carried away. I told her that Seinfeld was way before my time and then she started insulting me and laughing because apparently its still on or something. 

When we got to her apartment her neighbors were having a party so of course she rushed in and just started being super social again. I was exhausted and ready for me time so I told her I was going home to which she said ""call me tomorrow!"" as the door was closing. The scariest event I've ever been through and her leaving response was ""call me tomorrow!"" while she went off to party. 

She's called me a few times but I just don't feel like talking. She just texted that since I apparently don't have any plans for her she's going out but ""I'm more than welcome to meet her downtown."" No apology, no are you ok, nothing. 

Like I said, I really like her but I'm not convinced shes the ""one"" but I want to see if she is. But after this...is there any coming back from this? I'm scared of being totally single again and scared of how long it will be before I have sex and feel close to someone again. 



   
**tl;dr**: girlfriend pulled a very scary and humiliating trick on me last night. I don't know if there is recovery from what she did. She doesn't seem sorry at all. "
"My mother(42F) is about to cut me(17F) off because my boyfriend(18M) is poor!


Hello, Reddit. I am stuck in a massive dilemma.

My boyfriend, Jacob and I have been dating for a few months now. I haven't told my parents about him until a few weeks ago and my mother met him for the first time last week. Jacob is the most amazing guy I have ever met in my life. He is brilliant, funny, and is generally a very positive and hard working individual. He is also poor. His father died and had no life insurance, so he and his mother were left with nothing pretty much. Jacob works extremely hard for everything he has and accepts help from no one. I admire him for that. I come from a very rich family. They have lived in a wealthy bubble all their lives. I have heard my mother say that poor people don't work hard for money so they could just get it free from the government. I do not share the same beliefs as her at all. 

Last week, my parents were out of town. I invited Jacob over to see my house for the first. We were in the pool when my came home early from her trip. I introduced her to Jacob and she was delighted to finally meet him and asked him to stay for dinner. He agreed and during dinner my mom started interrogating him. She asked what his father does for work, he told her he passed away. She asked what his mother does for work,he told her she's a CNA. I saw her face scrunch up a little, then she stopped asking him questions. After dinner was over and Jacob left, my mom told me that she was disappointed that I would date someone like him and that he is using me for my money. She said I should stop seeing him from now on because he could never make me truly happy. She then started blaming herself because she let me watch Aladdin too much growing up and it clouded my judgement(literally what the fuck?). I told her she was ridiculous and continued to see Jacob.

She sat me down this morning at breakfast, told me that she could cannot support my support my decision to be with Jacob and then handed over emancipation papers. I started flipping out, screaming and calling her crazy. She told me I have until tonight to choose if I want to keep living this life or to start a new one with Jacob. If I don't give her an answer by tonight then she would make the decision for me. I tried calling my father but he is on a business trip on the other side of the world so he didn't answer. I know he wouldn't agree to this but I can't get in touch with him and I'm freaking out! What do I do?!

**TL;DR: I am rich. Boyfriend is not. Mother is angry and is about to cut me off. Father is asleep on the other side of the world. Help me, please!**

**Edit update: I got in contact with my dad! I told him everything and he is LIVID. He told me the same thing you guys did, that she can't force me to sign those papers and to stay in my room and not speak to my mother. He said he will catch a flight back home first thing in the morning. He also told me that he loved me and that he doesn't care who I date. Will update on what happens when he gets home.**"
"My [47M] son [19M] is angry that my niece/his cousin [19F] moved in with me. Today, he locked her out of the house.


Hello, everyone. In advance, thank you for reading this post. I’m at my wit’s end here and I really need some unbiased insight. 

First, I’ll provide some background that I think is relevant.

My son “Seth” is my only child from my second marriage. His mother “Lydia” [47F] and I divorced when he was four years old. He was very upset when this happened. The entire process was very hard on him. All he wanted was for us to get back together. However, it was Lydia who decided that she didn’t want to be married and that she didn’t want to raise a kid. She just wanted her freedom back, what she had when she was living the single life. I wanted to go to marriage counseling and work things out, but she just wanted a divorce. Eventually, I acquiesced. Seth went to live with her, and he came to my house on the weekends. (Lydia didn’t want to raise a kid, but she did want a kid around when she felt like having one around. She only wanted to be a parent when it was fun.) Currently, Lydia and I are courteous with each other, but we only talk when we absolutely need to. Seth is much, much closer to her than he is to me because she’s the “fun parent” and because I remarried to a woman that he dislikes.  

I remarried when Seth was fourteen to my current wife “Michelle” [45F]. I dated Michelle for ten years before I married her, and she moved in with me three years into our relationship. The reason why I dated Michelle for ten years before I married her is because of Seth. He has never liked Michelle. To him, this woman has been trying to replace his mother for his entire life. I thought that marrying her would drive him away, and I didn’t want that. So I waited. For ten years, yes, and I understand that that’s a ridiculously long time, but I just wanted to do what I thought was best for Seth. I didn’t want him to be unhappy. I didn’t want him to hate me. I made this major sacrifice because I didn’t want to completely lose him to his mother, who may be the “fun parent”, but is irresponsible, immature, and a bad role model. She is not a good influence on Seth, and because of the way she approaches parenting (which is not really parenting at all), he will never reach his full potential. I wanted to make sure that he would grow up right, so I tried to stay in his life as long as possible by keeping my relationship with Michelle at bay. But after I married her, Seth grew much more distant, as I feared but ultimately expected. However, he still has his own bedroom in my house. I always invite him to family functions, even though he always turns me down. I keep the door open for him in case he ever wants to reconnect. He knows that he’s always welcome in my home. He has yet to accept it, but I remain firm on being there for him. 

Now, onto the actual issue. 

Michelle moved in with me when Seth was seven years old, and after she moved in, her niece “Olivia” started visiting us, and her and Seth grew very close. They spent almost all of their time together as children. They were best friends. They were completely inseparable. 

However, around the time that Seth and Olivia became preteens, Seth started protesting about Olivia. He didn’t want her to come over anymore. He didn’t want to spend time with her. He didn’t want anything to do with Michelle’s family, and that included Olivia. And I listened to him. Olivia stopped coming over. If she did come over, it was with her parents, and it was always when Seth wasn’t around. Currently, Olivia and Seth rarely talk. They haven’t been true friends in years. However, I still continued to see Olivia often because of Michelle. 

Last June, Olivia’s mother (Michelle’s sister) and father died in a car accident. Michelle and I made arrangements for Olivia to move in with us. She went off to college, and she came back for Thanksgiving and winter break. She is now back for summer vacation. She was already an independent adult when she moved in with us, so we’re not her legal guardians or her adoptive parents. But we do care for her and look out for her as if she were our child. After her parents died, she needed parental figures in her life, even though she was technically an adult. 

Seth didn’t discover that Olivia has moved in with me until recently, and that’s because he rarely talks to me anymore. (I’m not sure where he thought she was living after her parents died…but it doesn’t matter.) He currently lives in the basement of his girlfriend’s house (she’s still in high school) and he has a job working on cars. So he’s living his own life. To him, he has no reason to care about what goes on in my house.

At the beginning of this month, Seth came to my house to pick up some clothes, and when he walked into the basement, he saw where Olivia’s been living for the past year. He asked Olivia what was going on, and when she explained everything, he ran upstairs and started yelling at me. He was angry beyond belief. I tried having a rational conversation with him, but he wasn’t having any of it. He kept saying things like “she’s not even your daughter” and “she’s an adult, why can’t she get her own place?” It was extremely frustrating. He wouldn’t listen to a word of what I had to say. He left soon after. I didn’t hear from him for several weeks, until last week when he came over to retrieve some of his music from our desktop computer. He dropped by, did what he had to do, and left without a word. 

Today, Olivia had a Skype interview at 4PM for an internship position. At 3:30, she went outside to move the trash cans to the curb. When she went outside, she passed by Seth as he was walking in and said hi to him. He stops by whenever he needs to get something, so she didn't think anything of it. However, she didn't get to go back inside. When she went outside to move the trash cans, Seth locked all of the doors. She had also left her phone inside, so she couldn’t call me or Michelle for help. Around 5, Seth finally let her back in. I got home around 5:15 to see them having the most major shouting match they’ve ever had. After Seth stormed out, Olivia explained to me what happened. Seth told her he locked her out because “she deserved it” and because “you shouldn’t even be living here, let along having a fucking job interview on our computer”. 

Last week when he was over, Seth must’ve seen that Olivia had a Skype interview today, as she posts sticky note reminders to herself on the desktop of the computer. So he came over here today just to purposely sabotage her. This makes me angrier than I’ve been in a very long time. I can’t even begin to describe how upset I am with him. He cost her an important job opportunity. 

So, Reddit, what do I do? Should I try to talk to my son about this? Should I change how I’ve been treating him thus far? Could that be the reason why he’s behaving so maliciously? This is not the boy I know. He feels like a complete stranger to me. I can’t believe he would do something so spiteful. Can anything be salvaged from this?

**TL;DR: When my son Seth was four, his mother “Lydia” and I divorced, and it was very tough for him. Currently, he is much closer to her because she’s the “fun parent” and because I remarried to a woman “Michelle” that he dislikes. When Seth was growing up, he was best friends with Michelle’s niece “Olivia”, but eventually he stopped wanting to see her. Last June, Olivia’s parents died in a car accident, and Olivia moved in with us. Seth didn’t discover this until the beginning of this month, and he was extremely angry. Today, when Olivia was doing a chore outside, Seth locked her out of the house, causing her to miss a very important Skype interview. I’m very upset with my son. What do I do?**

edit: I saw some questions about Seth's relationship with Michelle and Olivia, as well as some questions about Lydia, so I'll add my answers to the post.

When Seth was a kid, Michelle tried hard to connect with him. He accepted her, but as he got older, he didn't want to engage with her anymore. She respected that. She didn't force him to spend time with her or anything like that. She always invited him to do things with her, but she didn't create drama or negativity when he turned her down. She is nice to him and has never done anything malicious to him. If she had, I never would've married her.

Seth's desire to stop seeing Olivia wasn't immediate. As time went on, he started asking me more and more, and when he became visibly angry about it, she stopped coming over. So she started to come to my house less and less often. As far as I know, nothing particularly terrible happened between them for him to start acting like this. Olivia thought that they stopped being close because they were preteens and it was that awkward stage when kids of the opposite gender felt weird spending time with each other. I plan on asking her if something happened that she hasn't told us about.

As for Lydia being an irresponsible parent...sometimes during the week, I would open my front door to find her standing there with Seth, and she would ask me to watch him for a while because she just couldn't deal with him at the moment. ""For a while"" and ""At the moment"" turned into days sometimes. She was all too happy to take him to the amusement park, but she never wanted to do things like go to his parent-teacher conferences. Even though she didn't want to raise a kid, she wanted custody of him because she didn't want me to have more influence over him. Because she didn't want to raise a kid, she treated Seth more like a mini-adult than a child. I believe that wanting to raise a kid and wanting to be around a kid are two different things, and she wanted the latter. Anything serious was left up to me.

Lydia is immature because she still acts like she's in high school. She skips work when she isn't sick. She gossips about her friends behind their backs. She hates commitment of any kind; she wants to have her way until it's too much work to keep it that way. I know that she doesn't like Michelle, and I strongly suspect that she has turned Seth against her. When I married Michelle, Lydia was very immature about the entire issue. I had to prohibit her from coming to the wedding. She gave Michelle second thoughts about marrying me in a very underhanded way. Those must've spread to Seth as well, because he stopped wanting to spend time with Michelle after I married her.

edit 2: all of these comments about how I enabled my son's entitled behavior are very eye-opening. I hadn't realized this. I just want to add that I appreciate the honesty. 

edit 3: a poster was appalled that I did not include any information about what happened to my niece after my son sabotaged her. So here is what I told them. I called the company the day of the incident and explained what happened. They understood but didn't re-offer the position. I have since talked to my niece about everything.

I plan on posting an update that will elaborate on this once I feel that there is enough to warrant an update. "
"UPDATE: I [25/F] got told by my dad [50's/M] that him and my step mom [50's/F] want to split their will 40/40/20 between me and my step siblings. I'm conflicted.


Hello everybody! :)
 

[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jsr4x/i_25f_got_told_by_my_dad_50sm_that_him_and_my/)

 
tl;dr of last post: My dad and step-mom want to split their will 40/40/20 between me and my step siblings, based on the fact that they are assuming I am getting 100% of my mom's assets and they aren't in contact with their father - but they have been. I'm feeling slighted and less important to them than my step-siblings and I'm not sure if I should be upset. Opinions?
 

(feel free to skip to the actual update if you don’t feel like reading my wordy tidbit in regards to my OP – just want to get some stuff on my chest)
 

I just wanted to start off by saying that I am over-whelmed by the amount of responses I received, I did not expect that. I read every single comment, and took everything that was said into account. As I said in my OP, I was genuinely unsure about how to feel about the situation, and that’s why I came here for an outside perspective. I wanted to go about this with a level head, I didn’t want to come across as selfish or ungrateful. I am beyond grateful that I’m getting anything at all from them, never once did I feel entitled to anything. I’ve never even THOUGHT about the situation until my dad asked for opinion on the phone that night. I also just want to clarify that I never told my dad I deserved more and I never told them how to distribute their money. He specifically said to me “We are doing our wills and we don’t want to make anyone upset. We are thinking 40/40/20, 20 going to you. Do you think this is fair?” **So I want to express the fact that he asked me for my thoughts on this.** The more people I spoke to about it and the more I thought about it, the more slighted I felt. Which is why I came here, because I needed clarity on the situation.
 

ONE MORE THING before the update. I want to express that my dad is not a bad person. In this situation he may come across that way to some, but we are actually quite close (maybe that’s why I was so conflicted) and he has always been a good dad to me. Sure, he can be an ass (aren’t we all sometimes?) and perhaps he is a little “weak” (as one commenter put it) when it comes to my step-mom…but I guess that’s what happens when two people are in love, especially when all your kids have moved out and have their own lives. I know that I, for one, would do anything in the world for my boyfriend. That being said, we don’t have children yet. So I don’t know at this point in my life who would take precedence over who in this scenario. I’d like to think I would always have everyone’s best interest at heart, and I know my dad does as well. He is only trying to be fair to everyone, and I know this. Yes, I’ve felt slighted for more than half my life with that side of the family, always feeling the like the odd one out in almost every situation, being treated this way strictly because I had my mom on the other side of things. My dad basically just tried to keep the peace, tried to keep everyone happy, and his wife the happiest. Can I really fault him for that? I don’t know. I have my mom who would walk to the ends of the Earth for me and I am so very thankful for that, and my step-siblings don’t necessarily have that (however, I do think they would if they didn’t keep their relationship with their dad a deep, dark secret – but that’s not my business).
 

**Anyways…on to the actual update.** ...I guess this is equally as wordy...I talk a lot :)
 

I had lunch with my dad today. I went in with a list of things I wanted to know. Basically, I wanted to know if they were talking about a joint will, or separate wills, and if this 40/40/20 was the ratio on HIS will. I wanted to know if he died before my step-mom, what would happen? Does everything get passed on to her and then she’s free to change the will at that point? If so, how does he know she wouldn’t write me out of the will completely – and does he think it’s fair to leave that option open? Also, the fact that they were basing this decision partially on the fact that my step-siblings “haven’t had contact with their dad in 20 years”, it was going to be a game-time decision whether or not I was going to tell him that simply was not true, as my step-sister did give me the okay to tell him if I had to. However, I didn’t feel it was my place and opted to keep it a secret – it is not my secret to tell.
 

He said that it was one will with both their assets (so I guess that’s a joint will?) and that if he died before my step-mom, everything would go to her and vice versa. I asked what was stopping her from changing the will at that point and giving her kids everything? And he said “she would never do that, she’s not that kind of person”. I said “maybe so, but LEGALLY, what is stopping her from doing this?” He said technically nothing is. I asked if he thought that was fair. And he said it doesn’t matter because he would never marry someone who had morals like that. I asked if he could see my point though, and he said he could and he will discuss this with my step-mom. I don’t know where that will go though. **Also, might be worth noting that I asked him who's idea the 40/40/20 ratio was, he said it was his. Not hers. I'm unsure if he's lying to cover her or if he's telling the truth. I don't know what I was looking for with that question, because I guess both answers are frustrating. But there it is.*
 

Now that I know the answers to these questions, I thought that it would be best for me to be the bigger person. I am fully aware that it is their money to do as they please, never thought otherwise. If that means that they think I should get less, then that’s just the way it is. Do I agree? Honestly, whether I do or not, I don’t think it would’ve mattered. Not my money, not my business. I expressed my point of view to my dad, because I thought I would regret it if I didn’t. Now that I have, I’m in the mindset that it is what it is. Personally, I don’t have the energy to argue about it. I just don’t care. I stress and worry about enough in my own life. It wasn’t about the money at all, I wasn’t upset that I was getting less than my siblings money-wise. I was feeling slighted because it looked like I was worth half as much to them as my step-siblings were. I know that isn’t true (for my dad anyways) and I never thought he was doing this maliciously. If he wanted to hurt me, he would’ve just not told me and would’ve left me to be blind-sided at the time of his death. But he kept expressing that he wanted to “be fair” and asked for my thoughts, so I told him how I felt about it.
 

I still felt a bit slighted, but that’s just the way I feel with that family anyways. I’m the outsider and I don’t think that will ever really change, and this situation just kind of…solidified that. And yet, on the other side of things, I’m the centre of my mom’s universe. It’s an interesting dynamic, one that was (and still kind of is obviously) hard to get accustomed to, even after all this time. It’s not my fault that my parents divorced and didn’t have any more children. It’s not my fault that my parents decided to share custody so I was always having to move back and forth (thus only being at each place half the time). It’s not my fault that my mom married a guy who didn’t have any kids of his own, and it’s not my fault that my dad married a woman with two other kids and a mess of issues. I had no control over any of these things, just like I have no control over this (again – not that I expect to). 


I told him all of this. I felt I needed to get it all off my chest and I feel better after saying it. I don’t think he realized that this is how I’ve always felt. He apologized for making me feel this way and assured me that this was never their intention, and I knew that it wasn’t. He kept assuring me that even though this is how it might be perceived and he respects that, it isn’t how it actually is. He told me he loved me, that I am his only daughter and he loves me the most – even though he would never say that in front of the other kids, but that it was true, and that he would do anything for me. I think I just took this whole thing more personally than it was meant to be, but my dad also said he didn’t think about how it would make me feel on a personal level, and he was only thinking about it in a monetary way. At the end of the day, I have decided to let this go. 


I don’t know if they will change anything or not, but after talking to my dad, I feel like I was candid about how I felt, and so was he, and I guess that’s all I needed to hear. Like I said a hundred times, it was never about the amount of money I was or wasn’t getting. So, it’s just not worth the fight.
 

I am still close with my step-sister, we’ve always been close and I don’t think that will change. When I was talking to her about this, she told me that she would give up her share if this was going to cause any problems in our relationship. I said absolutely not, that’s not what this is about and I would never blame her or resent her for any of this. We are good. As for my step-brother, we’ve never been close, and that probably won’t change either. He’s a weird dude. As for my step-mom, we’ve never been close either and that also probably won’t change. I’m choosing to spend my time putting in effort and showing love to the people who do the same for me. The people who matter in my life. I’m done putting in any extra effort for those who don’t care.
 

So that’s it. Long story short, I’m letting it go. Thank you again for all of your advice, it really helped me gain perspective on this and I really, truly appreciate everyone’s thoughts :)
 

*PS: (jokingly) asked for the cars along with the 20%, he said he’ll be selling the cars to expedite retirement. Told him he sucks. He said my boyfriend can have all his tools though :P*
 

**Tl;dr:** Spoke to dad. He answered all the questions I wanted answered. Have come to the realization that I will forever be the outsider in their family and will do my best to accept that. That family is my dad’s family, not mine, but he is still my dad. Letting this whole thing go. Money is not important. The people who show you their love and respect are important. Will spend my time showing those people how much I love and appreciate them. Ain’t nobody got time for anything else. Except for pizza. Everyone has time for pizza."
