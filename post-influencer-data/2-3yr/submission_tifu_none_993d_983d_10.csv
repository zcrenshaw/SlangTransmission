"Tifu by accidentally becoming gay on New Years


Well here goes, t'was the night of new years and i was at a friends place just outside of town. Our group had planned on having this sort of ""grown up night"" instead of a New Years party. We had planned on getting together making a three course dinner and playing games and just enjoying ourselves. Yeah I know. (The reason being is that the majority of us in this group of 13 are in relationships. 5 couples and 3 single boys to be exact) anyways as the night went by we kept joking about having no New Years kiss and so on and me and my friend, we'll call him Dave, start joking about being each others New Years kiss.

Okay you need to have this in mind: I'm a guy who's not really into the hummus business but I don't really back off when it comes to kissing dudes or making out with another with them for that matter. I figure ""hey thats just another person, kissing another dude doesn't mean i enjoy getting my plum penetrated by another mans love stick. 

Anyways the count down begins and we just go for it (just a small kiss on the lips and nothing more). Just for the sake of the meme we hold each other, in an unholy position that only love birds whom are about to marry one another should hold, and start enjoying the fireworks. At this point one of the so called ""females"" notices us and starts to laugh and doesn't believe that we actually kissed so just to fuck with her we go at each other as if our life depended on it. Someone films this on the platform know to man as snapchat and sends it to world with the caption ""so glad they finally came out"". The night continues and so does the party.

The next day me and Dave are in town and enjoying our afterparty tradition which is hungover kebab-pizza with extra garlic sauce and this random couple (16 or something, my little sisters friends) congratulate us. We don't think of it much and just assume they mean new year. We go home to my place to play some video games and hangout and thus my father happens. He congratulates us as well and tells Dave he's glad that I chose him out of all the other people in an awkward manner. I still haven't got it but Dave's laughing his ass off. I ask my dad if he can leave us alone and he tells me ""oh i see you want some space to do your thing now that there's no hiding it."" and winks. That's when I realize and panic. It turns out some asshole saved the snapchat video (somehow) and shared it on facebook. Being in a small town, everyone wanted to show that they're tolerant and fund of these so called ""hummus-people"" so everyone liked and shared the video.

It's January the 2nd and everywhere i go people congratulate me. Yayy. I guess I'm a gay now.

Edit: Well that escalated quickly. Yay we managed to get the comments locked. 

Edit 2: Eyyy thanks for the gold random stranger. I literally have no clue what to do with reddit gold though.

tldr: made out with a friend (guy) on New Years as a joke. It went viral. Everyone in my town thinks I'm homosexual. I guess I'm gay now.

"TIFU by not sleeping and ending up with permanent brain damage


This happened almost a year ago exactly, on January 2nd.

I've snowboarded almost my entire life, and would consider myself decent. My dad got a hold of me the day before this happened wanting to go on our first ski trip for the season. 

Now the prior season I had damaged one of my boards beyond repair and hadn't gotten around to getting a new one, so I decided to use an old one (first mistake). I stayed up all night stripping it down and giving it a new paint job. Didn't get a minute of sleep. In my sleep deprived state, I accidentally switched my left and right binding when I put them back on, didn't wax the board, and forgot my helmet when I was loading up the car.

6+ hour drive later, get to the resort and realize I forgot my helmet, and stupidly thought I'd be fine without one because I've snowboarded so long. First trip down the slopes went alright, but second trip down I'm having problems controlling the board because the bindings were switched, and I didn't wax or edge it. I hit a patch of ice and catch way too much speed and my two options are hit the little kid that just cut in front of me and definitely hurt him, or go off what I **thought** was a short drop off to the side of the trail.

Of course I decided to go off the very much not short drop off. End up falling ~15 feet before the tip of the board catches in ice, slamming me head first into the hard ice. Roll another 50 feet so so, hitting every imaginable spot on my head. Almost blacked out, super out of it. I sit there for 20 minutes, board snapped in half, goggles and hat 50 feet behind me.

Finally manage to get my stuff and get down the hill to find my dad, who refused to get ski patrol cause it was ""just a headache"". Called them myself, got told I was fine and eyes rolled at me. Dad drives me 6 hours home instead of taking me to the hospital down the road. Mom proceeded to take me to the hospital, where it was confirmed there was some heavy brain damage.

Fast forward through a year of countless appointments with neurologists, occupational therapy, hospital visits, missing almost the entire last semester of my senior year and nearly didn't graduate, and took a semester off before I start college. I'm left with ADHD like problems, mood swings, horrible coordination, problems sleeping, a stutter on occasion, and many other problems.

Wear your helmet kids.

TLDR; Didn't sleep, didn't wear a helmet snowboarding, permanent brain damage and problems for likely many years to come

Edit: Yes, I know I was an idiot. And yes, I know this was my fault. I just thought I'd share so others don't make the same stupid decisions as I do.

If you guys are really that concerned about this being a karma grab, I mentioned my TBI in a couple of comments a few months ago

"TIFU: Guess which one I put in my eye?


https://i.imgur.com/8qWDpRw.jpg

On the bright side, my right eye is now free of all that wax. 

EDITED: Post was removed for lack of context so... There are two bottles. They look similar. One is for ear wax removal while one is a bottle of eye drops. Pre-coffee and groggy, I grabbed the ear wax drops and dropped a couple into one of my eyes. It hurt and I felt like an idiot.

EDIT #2: Post was removed for violation of sub rule 2E) Nothing significantly bad happened to you as a result. So to continue from where we left off: Ear-wax drops contain hydrogen peroxide, which Consumer Med Safety refers to as ""a painful mistake"" to put in your eye. Their story checks: It was painful. I was able to flush my eye out with water pretty quickly, though there was a lingering burning and redness for quite some time. It didn't warrant a trip to the ER, thankfully, unlike many of the commenters who have stories of mixing up eye drops and super glue (I can't even). Though it wasn't as painful as the time I had bear mace directly contact my eye (that's a whoooole 'nother TIFU), I strongly recommend double-checking any and all bottles of eye drops before using them.

"TIFU by not washing down a bloody nose out of my bath tub


Last night around 4am, I got one of my worst bloody noses I've ever had (gross, I know). Due to the nature of said nosebleed, I basically have to stand in my shower and let it bleed out and no amount of Kleenex will stop it. It finally stops bleeding and my tub looks like a war zone. 

Usually, I would wash it down. However, it was 4am, and I didn't want to wake up my parents or sister with running water. I left it for today. 

This morning, I'm woken up by my mom screeming. Before I have time to comprehend what's going on, she storms into my room screaming ""please be alive,"" thinking I've cut myself. 

I sleep naked. It's far more comfy that having your junk be constrained by boxers. However my mom doesn't know this. I struggled with her to keep myself covered up. I lose, and I'm naked as a jaybird and embarrassed as hell. 

I ask what the problem is and she is asking if I'm suicidal. Confused, I ask her why would she think that and she said ""your bath tub!"" Oh fuck. Had to explain that I had a nose bleed and didn't want to wake her at 4am.

Tl;Dr I got a bad bloody nose, didn't wash it down, and mom though I was suicidal."
"TIFU by almost getting disowned by my wifes' family for xmas


This happened xmas eve/ xmas day.   My favorite holiday is Halloween and I love dressing up and being festive for holidays.   This year, I decided to buy one of those ""riding a snowman"" costumes to wear at our family gatherings.   I also bought an ugly xmas sweater that had a picture of a cartoon tree saying ""I don't want your balls on me"" with (2) red tree decorations (round balls basically).   I threw on an elf hat with fake ears and I was ready to be the funny idiot at Christmas.

I went to my family gathering xmas eve (tons of people and little kids aged 2 and up)  Walked in and everyone had a laugh, the kids thought it was funny and I proceeded to have a merry Christmas....

Next day I decided to wear it to my wife's family gathering...they are a little more serious and straight laced than my family, but I've known them for 19yrs now and they know I'm a moron who does stuff like this. (I wore the bunny suit from a ""A Christmas Story"" there last year)....well, immediately upon entering my sister-in-laws house, my nieces descended upon me and basically attacked me (not the reaction I was expecting)....it was at that moment I realized that the carrot nose on the snowman wasn't in the most appropriate place....they start tugging on the carrot and punching the snowman in the face (or my crotch depending on the way you look at it)...her grandfather shoots me a look of death and I decide it's time to lose the pants.   No big deal as I had pants on underneath.

I couldn't however lose my sweater because I only had a raggy white t-shirt underneath.   The kids there ranged from 1-about 5 1/2...

As we're half way through dinner and everyone is eating at the table, my sweet as can be 5yr old niece who was sitting across from me blurts out (real loud and clear too...) ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!""  ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!"" ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!""......

I didn't realize any of them could read yet.   HONESTLY.

I try to cover up and explain to her that the hooks on the ornaments are sharp and heavy and the trees don't like them

Her grandparents are now murdering me with their eyes and her aunt starts yelling how inappropriate I am and how dare I wear something so horrible when I knew there would be little girls around.

My wife said I went from being the ""fun uncle"" to the ""creepy pervert uncle"" really fast....

I apologized but felt pretty bad about it.   Don't know if I can show my face there next year now.

TL;DR - wore inappropriate apparel to holiday gathering and now I'm labeled a pervert by my in-laws.

"TIFU By Putting My Dildo In The Dishwasher


**PART I**
The Mistake 

It was my day to do the dishes. I just got this dildo as a present from my girlfriend. It's plastic, lime green, and vaguely penis shaped but not obvious. 

I share a bathroom with my sister (8 years my junior) and couldn't risk being caught scrubbing it in the sink, and didn't know if hand sanitizer/wipes would be thorough enough, so as a last resort, I threw it in the top rack of the dishwasher. Usually my family avoids housework like the plague, so I wasn't worried about anyone touching the dishwasher. I loaded the detergent, pressed ""start"", and waited anxiously for the cycle to finish. I got up to plug my phone in, and having been up all night before studying, fell asleep. 

I woke up three hours later and raced to unload the dishwasher. There, like a lemon scented Freudian nightmare, was my mother in her yellow dish gloves, holding my dildo. 

""Mom, I can explain this--"" she cut me off, ""Don't worry, I should have told you."" I looked at her, confused. ""I know it's your day to wash up but you'd been studying so hard I didn't want to wake you. I forgot to tell you we need to unload early today because your grandparents are coming for dinner."" My mother talks with her hands, so as she tells me my grandparents are visiting, she's flailing the sex toy around like a baton. 

She says ""But I was wondering,"" (in reference to my dildo) ""where does this go, I don't recognize it."" I was at a loss for words. Because of the plastic and the bright color, and you know, finding it in the kitchen, she apparently assumed it was some sort of cooking utensil. ""Oh, is it one of those wands to drizzle sauce?"" Panicked I just vigorously nodded my head while she put it away in a drawer. 

I spent the next two hours plotting how to sneak it out of there, but she was cooking right from the time she found it. She didn't even stop for a bathroom break. 

I tried to set off a smoke detector so we'd all have to leave the house, but by the time I came up with this idea and I found one of my dad's lighters, she was already setting the table. And to my horror, my nine year old sister was carrying our third generation antique gravy boat to the table, with my dildo sticking straight up, erect, if you will, in the sauce. 

I called my best friend and begged him to say I'd borrowed the ""sauce drizzler"" from him and he needed it back now, but by the time he stopped laughing and listened to my plea, my grandparents had already arrived. And we don't live in the kind of community where friends drop by unexpected, so if he came now it would arouse suspicion. 

**PART II**
The Dinner 

My grandparents had arrived and were hanging out in the TV room playing checkers with my little sister. The table was set and we were waiting to eat until my dad got back from work. So about this time he comes in the door and my mom furiously ushers everyone in to the dining room (alcove just off the TV room). 

I'm almost sweating through my shirt, my face is red, and I'm usually pretty quiet but out of nervousness I just couldn't shut up. My dad put his hand on my shoulder and I jumped out of nervousness. He said ""You ok 'athrowawayof_course'?"" I said ""Of course I am I'm always ok, everything's fine and I'm so lucky to have such a great family and pot roast is my favorite, but you knew that didn't you?"" He gave me a sideways look and sat down. We said grace (yep, we're religious, because that helps me so much in this situation) and my dad started to carve the roast for everyone. 

I'm practically unconscious from anxiety at this point and my leg is shaking which is noticeably shaking the table. My father says to my mother ""Pass the gravy down please?"" He picks up my dildo by the base, and starts to absentmindedly drizzle the gravy when he furrows his brown and slowly looks down at the ""gravy wand"" in his hand, at my pale pathetic shaking self, and at the ""drizzler"" again, and *collapses* laughing. Big heaving chuckles and guffaws. He's in tears laughing and holding his sides while everyone goes ""What, what's funny?!?!"" He gets up and says through rips of laughter ""Excuse me everyone, I have to go wash my hands."" But as he's turning to leave he says ""Dad, I know you're not a fan of gravy but this is a new recipe and you have to try it."" My mother is like ""It's not a new recipe it's the same brand I always buy--"" But my dad is already out of the room. 

So my grandpa says ""Don't be silly, I'll give it a try, 'my mothers name'."" But as my sister passes it down, my grandmother grabs it first, since she's sitting closer. She drizzles a heap of gravy on to her meat and passes it to my grandfather. He picks it up and takes a little gravy when he gets a full view of what exactly he's holding. My grandpa is an OG. He didn't even crack a smile. He just slid the dildo back in to the gravy and placed it calmly back on the table. He throws an arm across my grandmother and says ""No more dear, I think the meat's a tad underdone."" She says ""What? Tastes fine to me."" And goes for another bite. My grandpa snatches the fork out of her hand and proceeds to go dump both their plates in the trash. My mother is appalled they don't want her cooking and offers to throw it back in the oven. My grandfather said ""At our age, food poisoning is serious business, can't take the risk."" My grandmother was about to further protest when my grandpa inconspicuously pulls the dildo out of the gravy enough for my grandmother to recognize it (I don't want to know why she could). She quickly says ""You know, I wasn't all that hungry anyways."" 

So my grandpa isn't going to let me get away with this that easy. It takes maybe three minutes before he says to my mother ""This *jerked* chicken is delicious."" I choked on the green bean I'd been nibbling. My confused grandmother said ""Dear, it's a pot roast. Are you feeling alright?"" My grandpa says ""Never. Better. I'm just saying this particular pot roast reminds me of pulled *pork*. Maybe it's something in the gravy? Then my grandmother realized what he was doing and firmly says ""David, stop it."" My mother goes ""Everyone is being so strange tonight. What is going on?"" My Dad walks back in, face still red from laugh-crying. 

My grandfather cuts in ""So, 'athrowawayof_course' I hear you've been studying *long and hard* for finals."" My mother doesn't get it and says ""With college applications coming up, it's never been more important."" My grandpa: ""Oh yah, yah, I hear it can be really difficult to *penetrate* that *inner circle*."" My Dad excused himself again. Just as he was leaving the table, the doorbell rings. In between snorts he calls to my mother ""I've got it hun!"" 

He answers the door and it's my neighbor from a few houses down, who also happens to be my and my sister's piano teacher, so she knows our family pretty well. She's locked out and wants to wait for the locksmith inside our place since it's so cold outside. My mother offers to fix her a plate. She gratefully accepts and sits down. She's met my grandparents before at our recitals so they get to talking about politics or whatever when my mother offers her some gravy. My dad and grandfather simultaneously go ""No!"" And my dad cuts in ""It's spoiled."" My mother says ""Nonsense. They've been strange all night, don't mind them. Must be the cold weather."" 

So my neighbor/piano teacher/family friend clasps my dildo with both hands and begins drizzling the sauce over her meat. She stops and puts it back in the boat, then raises her eyebrows all the way up, and pushes her plate away. A few silent seconds of chewing go by when my neighbor says ""'my mother's name'?"" -- *pause* -- ""There's an artificial phallus in the gravy."" 

**PART 3** 
Aftermath 

So a few minutes after that my grandfather got up and thanked my mother for the most exciting meal he'd had since the war, and got the heck out of dodge. My father was trying to collect himself from laughter again, and my mother was multitasking between assuaging my piano teacher and my sister's questions about what an ""artificial phallus"" is. 

It is around that time my mother points at me and says ""Room. Now."" I'm just glad to have a reason to leave the table. 

About forty five minutes later my mother comes in to lecture me about boundaries and morals and hygiene. Informs me I'm grounded from now through all of winter break. She hands me back my toy, and says I'm not in trouble for owning it, I'm in trouble for ""bringing it to dinner."" 

She gets up to leave, but as she does, she turns to me and says one last thing. ""Son, I know at this age you'll experiment with your sexuality, but hear me when I say, you won't do it in the kitchen."" 

*TL;DR I put my dildo in the dishwasher and my mother mistook it for a serving utensil. She then used it to dispense gravy at a dinner with my little sister, grandparents, and piano teacher. Chaos ensued.*

PS: This happened last week but because of the dildo component I couldn't post it until the weekend. "
"TIFU by wearing new panties to work.


This TIFU actually took place this last Tuesday. I was back at the office following a depressingly short holiday vacation. I overslept my alarm, so when I got up I was in full Tazmanian devil mode. In the process of frantically dressing, I snatched a new pair of panties off the top of my dresser. They had a little paper tag in the back, which I ripped off before yanking them on, throwing on the rest of my clothes, and rushing out the door.

Fast-forward a couple of hours.

I'm at work, where I am a first-year attorney at a big(ish) law firm. In other words, I am an absolute peon in terms of office politics. I walk around on eggshells just trying not to fuck anything up too badly, and I sleep with my volume turned all the way up so that if a partner emails me at 2:00 AM I can respond quickly. The firm culture is such that we constantly have slightly too many associates, who are all vying for work from the same people. Nobody has to give you work, and if you don't get work, you get fired. Thus, it's important to me that I present myself as someone who is competent, polished, and basically capable of making it through the day without making a complete fool of herself.

I show up to the office looking okay, but definitely not done-up. I have long hair, which (see above re: being in a hurry) I am wearing down. Today I'm meeting with some of the higher-ups to work through some motions for this huge case we're on. The team is basically me, one other associate, and four of the biggest partners at our firm.

An hour or so passes, and as we trudge along I become increasingly aware of an uncomfortable itch right above my butt crack. Now, I can't do anything about this, for obvious reasons, so it doesn't take long before it progresses from uncomfortable to unbearable. Pretty soon I'm shifting around in my seat trying to scratch my ass against the office chair, which, as you might imagine, is not super effective. I'm trying something--anything--I can think of to scratch this damn itch, but everything I try is just making it worse.

I don't realize that I look like an idiot until I catch one of the partners staring at me. At that point, he unceremoniously barks, ""Let's take a quick bathroom break,"" and gives me a conspiratorial nod.

I'm embarrassed, but I'm not about to correct him because I can scratch my ass in the bathroom. So I rush outta there and hurry over to the bathroom in our floor. I go into one of the stalls, pull down my pants, figure what the hell, I might as well pee while I'm in here, and try to figure out what's up.

It turns out that while I had removed the *paper* tag, I had failed to rip out that stupid plastic piece that holds the tag to the fabric. You know the one--it looks kind of like an H, with the plastic on both sides. That thing has been scratching my ass all morning. No wonder.

So now I'm in the stall, and I don't have a lot of options in terms of tag removal. I don't have any scissors or anything with me, and there's no way in hell I'm going back with this tag on my panties. So I sit back against the toilet, lean forward, and pull the panties towards my mouth to bite off the tag.

It takes a minute, but I finally get it. Success! Yay! No more tag on my panties, and I didn't even chip a tooth. I get up to flush and pull my pants up, and that's when I notice it: the hair on the front right side of my head is wet.

Oh my God.

OH. MY. GOD.

I don't know how I didn't realize it, but while I was trying to maneuver that stupid plastic thing into my mouth, I must have DIPPED. MY FUCKING. HAIR. IN. THE. TOILET. The one full of pee.

I rush out of the stall. Thankfully, nobody else was in the bathroom, because now I'm bent over the sink just frantically washing my hair in the bathroom sink with the hands-free soap dispenser. After a couple of minutes, I finish, and look up...and that's when I remember I have to get back into the meeting.

I have to walk back into a meeting in a room full of people I work for with my hair dripping wet and zero explanation.

For some reason I decide it won't be as bad if BOTH sides are wet, so I haphazardly soak the other half of my hair. I have no hair ties or bobby pins, both things that I normally would have brought, except that today I was in too much of a hurry.

Eventually I run out of ideas, so I just squeeze my hair out as best I can and walk back into the conference room. Several people look at my hair, but nobody asks about it. I offer no explanation. Nobody says a damn thing until we get up to leave. I gather all of my papers and notes and promise everyone that I'll get this all done as soon as I possibly can. I'm ducking out of the room and I hear one of the partners saying to another, ""I must be going crazy, because I thought her hair was dry when we sat down in here.""

TL;DR: I failed to remove a plastic tag on a new pair of panties. When I finally did so, I managed to dip my hair in pee-filled toilet water and then had to go out into a room full of my bosses and pretend like nothing happened.



Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! :)"
"TIFU by borrowing my wife's deodorant


**EDIT:** Obligatory RIP my inbox. Thanks to everyone who replied. I got some good laughs with my wife reading some of the responses. And some of you helped me feel less awful with your own anecdotes.

**For those who are curious, 7 hours later later and it still burns like hell. I'll switch to real baby powder on my armpits for the next few days, maybe some kind of salve or cream in the meantime.**

*********************************

This literally happened 10 minutes ago.

So, today is the big Christmas dinner with my family, which we're doing on Christmas Eve for some reason.

I haven't seen a lot of my family members in the last year which, in terms of weight loss, was more than 50 lbs ago. I still have a long way to go, but I look much more presentable and dress much better, etc.

So I'm getting all primped up: haircut, shave the neck, trim the beard, go all out for looking my level best. Take a nice long shower, **and then the fuck up:**

I decide that recently, my deodorant hasn't been doing a great job of blocking out smells for more than maybe 3-4 hours, and this could be an all evening into nearly midnight event. So I got to grab my wife's deodorant and take the cap off.

Now, this isn't like any deodorant I've seen before. It [has a slotted top](http://i.imgur.com/PVs2YYK.jpg) where the gel comes out. She usually uses a baby-powder-based deodorant, which I find quite dry, so I figured this is a more gel-like version.

I rub it on my armpits and immediately get this funky smell....followed by an intense burning sensation. I flip it over and see, to my horror, [what it actually is](http://i.imgur.com/9Z1hfbX.jpg).

Nair. It's fucking Nair.

I run to the bathroom and trying wiping with a towel, which removes a few hairs and knots up some others. Unfortunately, I've done this to both armpits so I hop in the shower apply soap and vigorously rinse with warm water.

Brief relief. Then I make the second fuckup, which is putting my Old Spice on my armpits. **BURNS LIKE HELL, Part II**.

I hope in the shower and repeat the same procedure as before.

This time, I manage to use my wife's *actual* Dove deodorant, which has no added chemicals - just baby powder.

[My armpits may not look too bad in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/fD9BEJw.jpg), but it's been 10 minutes and they still hurt like hell.

**TL;DR - borrow my wife's deodorant, turns out it was Nair, chemical burns and fucked up armpit pair ensues.**"
"TIFU by working out too hard in the gym and getting served immediately by karma...ironic right?


So this happened a couple weeks ago, I was at my gym (which had just moved into a brand new location, new equipment, building etc.) and I was just starting what felt like a promising workout.

As a former college football player (24 years old) I'm what you might call injury prone, and have avoided bench press for the past few years and stick primarily to dumbbells for that good ole chest power. Cue fuck up #1 as I pick up the 100lb dumbbell from the bottom of the rack rather quickly, I bumped the one on the top rack, which happened to fall down behind the rack, and completely pulverize a massive new mirror in this brand new gym.

Luckily myself or no one else was hurt but as you can imagine this was quite embarrassing especially when the entire gym stopped to observe what had happened, being a large human (6'5 250lbs) I also felt like I was even more vulnerable in the crowd.

You know how they say when you break a mirror you get 7 years of bad luck? Well mine started immediately. Cue fuck up #2, after the staff closed off the area due to the shattered glass and things had cooled down I decided to continue my workout and give bench press a try with the dumbbells being closed off. As I said I was feeling quite good today so I worked my way up to a reasonable weight and began repping it  out.

Wow! This hasn't felt this easy in years I thought, until my 9th rep when I felt my pec muscle completely tear and curl up like window blinds being drawn up under my skin! It also didn't help that I was pinned by the weight and needed to call out for some assistance, not even 10 minutes after causing a massive scene breaking the mirror! 

I'm on my 4th day post surgery as I type this story with one hand! Hopefully the bad luck ended in the gym, happy New Years everyone!

TL;DR
Went to a new gym, shattered a massive mirror by accident, then tore my pectoralis major 10m later and am currently recovering from surgery! Karma hit me hard!

Edit; spelling
No I did not need a spotter I was repping out 225lbs, 9th rep when it tore unexpectedly as I was moving the weight quite easily. Also yes I warmed up with 1 set 135lbs, set 2 185lbs, set 3 205lbs all for 10 reps

"TIFU by opening a water bottle at an airport


So this just happened like an hour ago. I've a long lay over in an airport in eastern Europe, so I decided to buy a water bottle in the duty free. What I didn't know is that they packed it like alcohol, so you aren't supposed to open the package until you reach your final destination.

This doesn't stopped me, so as the madlad that I am, I go to the bathroom and drink some of the water there and then I put it back in my bag. But leave the package that says do not open until reaching final destination also in my bag.

5mins later as I'm walking through the airport a guard comes to me and starts speaking Russian, I don't understand anything and he says oh you look Russian (I'm Latin, whatever) he then asks for my passport and I start to get nervous since I've the open bottle in my bag, the guy notices and asks to search my bag.
He founds the bottle and starts questioning me, then he asks me to accompany him to a waiting room while they checked the bag.

Long story short, I lost my flight because of waiting there and they also kept my water bottle. Now I'm stuck here for 6 more hours and had to pay 200e for a new ticket, all because of a stupid water bottle.

TL;DR TIFU by opening a water bottle in an airport and getting caught. Which cause me to loose my flight and my water bottle."
"TIFU by not being able to tell between my left and my right.


I went to take my road test for my license a few hours ago. They have a course at the testing location so I didn't need to go out on the open road and drive. Everything was going pretty smoothly until the examiner said to ""stay on your right"". For some reason, most likely out of nervousness, I switched over to the lane on my left and I automatically failed. I was kinda shocked at first and now I'm just upset at myself for not being able to distinguish between my right and my left. It's also kind of embarrassing because almost everyone I know passed their drivers test on their first try. It feels like I'm the only one who needs additional attempts.

Edit: Thanks a lot guys for all the positive comments and encouragement! I'll have to wait two more weeks before I'm allowed another attempt. "
"TIFU: By not recognising piss.


So this happened on Saturday the 24th of December. Yes. Christmas Eve I fucked up pretty bad. 

So I work at a local EB games store and I can't help but inform you that I have some days where everything goes so damn well. Whereas others are just not so much. 

As some of you may be aware we trade in video games, which is a cool part of the job. You get to help people like yourself save heaps on new things. 

A pretty rough looking lady comes in and I get this smell in my nose and I just can't hit what it is but she comes to my till and asks if she could trade some games in. Of course I say yes and ask the mandatory questions. ""Do you have your EB world card and some photo ID for the trade?"" 

Now that there. That is where things got a little different. She asked ""can I use this as my photo ID?"" And pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from her bag. I unfold it and read it and it turns out to be a prison release form with everything I needed from a photo ID card to process the trade. So I double check with my manager to which he looks at me like ""... What the hell?"" But does agree and say I can. 

Onwards. I proceed to do this trade to which I find has a very obscure smell to it. I find myself trying not to gag multiple times as some of the games were quite damp. But I list them into a defective section so they can get sent to our warehouse and fixed if they're damaged. By now I'm assuming it's just water damage and maybe mould? Which... I guess it isn't too out of the ordinary coming from the neighbourhood I grew up in. A lot of people didn't treat their games as well as they should. But none ever this bad. 

So time goes by and we're fairly busy. So I put these games behind the counter on a shelf so we can sticker them up. This smell lingered on for quite a while.. 

Eventually it quietens down and we do everything we needed to. Except these games. To which the girl I'm working with gets to before I do. 

She pauses. Looks at me. Looks at the games. Leans in and sniffs. Looks back at me and says. "".. These smell like piss.."" 

My stomach drops at this point. She went through and found them all. I think back to when I had it all wet on my hands. I rush out the back and practically shower in this hand sanitiser we have and pretty much scream in silence.

We straight out threw those games in the bin with a note on them saying ""CHEMICALLY UNSTABLE"" just because we didn't want anyone going near them.

My managers don't scold me though as I was expecting. My assistant manager walks over to me with a slight scary smirk on his face and says to me ""I know in your time you've probably had some mad customers... but have you ever had anyone as pissy as her?"" And just laughed. 

TLDR: I accepted a game trade from an ex-prisoner who had pissed on her video games before trading them in. :( "
"TIFU by burning a hole in my leg for the THIRD time


Turns out I'm a bloody idiot.  Or a slow learner.  Bit of both, really.

I have spent 6 weeks healing a mysterious injury on my shin - I hadn't noticed walking into anything, I could only assume I'd been bitten by something in the night.  It had been cold weather, maybe some rogue poisonous spider was seeking shelter and I'd upset it by moving.  Seemed hugely unlikely as I don't live in Australia, anyway it had a lot of necrosis and wound up being an open injury about the size of a 10p/quarter.  It's mostly healed, but has another couple of weeks to go TBH.  Quite a wound.

4 weeks ago I incurred another (less severe) injury, same lower leg, thankfully it cleared in a fortnight.

Last night I got another one - this time on the foot of the same leg.  Pretty confidently ruling out bites now as this is still an angry red pre-blister.  And really hot...

6 weeks ago it was cold, I used a hand warmer to walk home.  4 weeks ago, similarly.  Last night again.  Finally I put 2 and 2 together.  The hand warmer I use is a Zippo naptha-based catalysing one.  

It sits in a little velvet bag, and is barely warm enough to warm a cold hand, so after the walk I'd throw it in the bed to take off some of the chill.  The design of the warmer is that you fill it with petrol, and 'light' it against a platinum catalyst - the catalyst heats up and vaporises more fuel, which is further catalysed in turn.  In normal usage it's constantly cooled by ambient circumstances, but in the bed it was insulated enough to keep heating up to maybe 60C - not normally any kind of risk, but if you're deeply asleep on your left side with warm feet for the first time in a day, it's possible to selectively cook yourself.  I did.

At least I'm not blaming spiders any more, I'm just an idiot misusing a runaway catalytic reaction.  And looking at my foot, and seeing the size of the cooked area, I'm looking at the end of Feb at least before I can claim to be restored."
