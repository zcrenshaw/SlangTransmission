"I [32 M] gave my brother [38 M] a laptop for my nephew, but my brother is now using it as his work laptop


My nephew is turning ten and is really into minecraft.  He has played with the lego sets since he was little and even reads the books about minecraft adventures (I didn't know that was a thing!).  The only time my nephew was able to play was on my mother's tablet every once in a great while because my brother uses his laptop for work.  

I was presented with an opportunity to get a used laptop for $100.  It's not a gaming laptop by any means, but it will play minecraft just fine.  Before I bought it, I spoke with my brother and told him that I wanted to buy the laptop so that my nephew would have something to do homework on but also so he could play minecraft.  He agreed and so I bought the laptop.  I spent some time setting it up, installing minecraft and other stuff like antivirus so that it was safe for him.  I gave it to my brother last fall.  

Fast forward to just recently when I was watching my nephew for the evening.  He said he wanted to play minecraft on my computer so I agreed.  I asked him what he liked to do in minecraft, what types of things he liked to build, but he said he never got to play.  Confused, I asked why not.  He said that they didn't have a computer for him to play on.  At this point I was already pretty certain of what had happened, but I didn't want to throw my brother under the bus.  I asked if he could use his dad's laptop to play on.  He said, ""Well, his black one has it installed, but that's always at work.  His silver one is too old and slow.""  The black laptop, is the one that I gave my brother.  

I'm pissed.  I never would have spent $100 to buy my brother a laptop.  I just wanted to do something nice for my nephew. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I bought a laptop for my nephew to use but my brother kept it for himself instead.  

Am I wrong to be upset? I understand that he is the parent but I feel taken advantage of.  I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but would it be out of line for me to demand that he either give it to my nephew or give it back? 

Edit: Holy shit.  I responded to the first couple of people that responded and thought that was the end of this, so I went to bed.  I never expected this post to get so much attention.  I'll never be able to respond to everyone, but I'll try and respond to the highest comments.  I'll update later if/when I confront my brother. "

"How do I [m 45] help my wife [45 f] with loss of baby?


As you can see, my wife and I are older. We have a son and a daughter both in college and have been together for 25 years, and weren't going to have any more kids. Then, she got pregnant.


It was great we were happy, we were ready, we are in a great position in our lives to have another baby. The pregnancy was fine, and we had no worries, then she had our son.

He had an enlarged heart that no one caught. I'm personally trying to cope with the fact that no one saw it. He lived for three days and passed and it was the worst experience of my life. I was holding him when he died.


My wife is an absolute mess. We made the guest bedroom into the baby's room and she goes in there and screams. I'll go home and she'll be laying there with the things we bought him and bawling. She won't go anywhere, she barely eats or speaks to anyone but me. She does go to greif counseling, but it's not helping. I did go to a session with her once, she's mad at me because I was holding him when he died. While I understand her anger, it's misplaced. Because that was incredibly hard and I'm still having nightmares about it...

When I suggested maybe we should donate the stuff she had a meltdown. I could go on and on about all the things she's been doing since the loss.

TL;DR older parents, baby died of unexpected heart issues and wife is beside herself. Greif counseling not helping.

EDIT:A few people have asked, and, she doesn't work. Never has. My son describes me as ""loaded"" got into the internet before it took off. 

All I'm saying about her greif is she hasn't improved at all. She was this upset six months ago. I want her to grieve, and I'd never take that away from her, but I also want her to get better... I love her."

"(update) My (18F) dad (48M) is taking money from me and my brothers (16&amp;26M), I don't know what to do


Last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5sxn5b/my_18f_dad_48m_is_taking_money_from_me_and_my/?st=iz7pcqfq&amp;amp;sh=421d72f1)

Hey guys, so it's been a crazy 2 weeks or so and I figured I'd fill you all in. I called my mom after seeing all your posts and worked up the courage to tell her what's been happening. She came and picked me up from school on Friday night and we had a long talk over the 3 hours home. Basically, she flat out told me that my dad is definitely using drugs. She knows, she's known this whole time. (Apparently she's got a good poker face). She didn't know that my dad had been taking money from me and my brothers, which really upset her. She has been trying for years to talk to my dad about his addiction but he always denies it (but she's not dumb, she knows what addiction looks like she says). We decided to hold an intervention on Saturday morning with my brothers and my mom. I had no idea how hard it would be. I've never been through anything more emotionally exhausting in my life, and honestly still can't believe that I had to do such a thing with my dad. I wish I could explain to you how normal of a guy his, and what a good person he is (besides this addiction). It was so painful to sit and accuse him of this, and have him deny it for probably an hour or so of us pleading with him and telling him that we'd still support him. Long story short, we eventually got it out of him. He broke down, and I mean BROKE. I have NEVER seen him cry, but he was in hysterics. He has a heroin addiction. It's been going on for years, and throughout the night he slowly confessed pieces of his habits. How much he was using, etc. He said he'd get clean for himself, and for us. He said it started after the pain was too much to handle after a surgery. I had to go back to school Sunday night, and he spent the week at a detox center. He's now home and looking into recovery centers, NA meetings, ect. He's a very different person, but not in a good way. He's angry, short tempered, and honestly so nasty. I've never seen him this foul, and I feel bad for my little brother having to witness it first hand. I read online it's his brain chemicals balancing itself out again or something? God I hope it's true.
My mom honestly had no idea how bad the finances were and took a good hard look at everything she thought was under control. It's not. He hasn't made a mortgage payment in quite some time and it looks like we're going to lose the house. I'm so broken right now, I can't believe my life is this. I can't my mom and my brothers, and my dad have to go through this. I want to thank everyone for their wisdom in what an addiction looks like. I feel so dumb for missing so many signs.

"I [25M] am planning to go to Disneyworld with my girlfriend [20F], her mum wants us to take her little sister [8F].


Hey guys, what's up. So for March break, my GF and I are going to Disneyworld in Florida. Yayy. We haven't booked the hotels yet...should probably get on that. Anyways, my GF's mother wants her to bring along her younger sister because she has never been to Disneyworld (her mum will pay for hotel+flight+other stuff). Her sister also really wants to go. Don't get me wrong, I've met her sister before. She is a nice, sweet, well-behaved little girl. 

But IDK, I kind of wanted this trip just to be for us. And not to mention the added responsibility of taking care of an 8 year old. My GF, though, thinks its a great idea. I love her sister but I really just want the trip to be a romantic relaxing one. Am I being selfish for wanting this? How can I go about telling her this without sounding like an asshole?

TL;DR: GF's younger sister wants to go to Disneyworld with us. I kind of just want the trip to be between my GF and I...

**EDIT** Good news, y'all. I phoned my girl, told her about my misgivings, and she called her parents. In the end GF's mum and dad will be taking the little sister to Disneyworld in early May. We will be postponing our trip until then as well. Good compromise between spending time with her family and having alone time! **"
"Lost expensive bracelet - fallout ensues [UPDATE]


[Original Post] (Https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5usoa0/lost_expensive_bracelet_boyfriend_31_bought_me_26/)


I (25F) got a huge response from this original post, some people were pretty harsh on me (damn you, tidy people!) and others were very sympathetic. I had a lovely message from someone with a similar experience and it made me feel a whole lot better.


When my boyfriend (31M) got in he was great, gave me a big hug and told me we could replace it. I wasn't fussed about a replacement, it was the thought that counted and every time I remembered the bracelet weeks on I got upset....


Today, weeks after I initially lost the bracelet and caused WW3 by making our house resemble a bombsite, I messaged all the places I went again. The restaurant messaged back saying there was no bracelets that have been handed in but to offer a description and she'll keep an eye out. I gave a description and then she sent me a picture. A PICTURE OF MY BRACELET. 


Keeping in mind I'd already rang the restaurant I was in shock and I've been beaming ever since. My boyfriend is collecting the bracelet for me tomorrow as it's near where he works. 


Miracles do happen! Thank you to everyone who offered support, tough love and advice. I have been working on being a bit tidier around the house anyway. This community is literally amazing, you've helped me though some important things and trivial things (like this)! Thank you!!!!!!!!!


**TL;DR** Lost bracelet 3 weeks ago. Acted like crazy woman and caused argument with boyfriend. Been in mourning ever since. Miraculously bracelet found at restaurant 3 weeks later.

"Me (38M) wanting to ask my (42F) GF to marry me but I want to involve her son (16M) and I'm a bit nervous


I met my GF we will call her M on okcupid 8 years ago. I was aware she was a widow, in fact I knew of her. We live in a small town and her husband was a hero cop killed in the line of duty.
When she messaged me on Okcupid I was surprised because A) she's way out of my league(she's a doctor, drop dead gorgeous, and very smart) and b) I was surprised she'd use Ok cupid as I knew several eligible bachelors that had her in their sights.

Anyway we hit it off, we went on several dates and she explained she wanted to take things slow because she was still healing from her husbands death, and she had a son who himself was slowly coming to the terms his father was gone and she wanted to tread lightly.
We dated for nearly 6 months before I met Christopher. I never wanted children, I love them but it wasn't a need. But I immediately fell in love with him, it was obvious he was struggling with his dads death but he was and is a great young man.
Speed up to now, things are great between us. All three of us, I moved in three years ago and it was a bit of a growing period but we got through it. I wanted to wait until she brought up marriage and in the last year she has, as well as trying for one last baby. I'm totally on board for both. I love this woman and cant wait to spend my life with her. Herein lies my reason for asking strangers on reddit. I want to involve Chris somehow, he is totally cool with us getting married. I just don't know how to go about asking him, trying to come up with a good idea. Also I'm nervous about proposing. I've heard stories (when we are hanging with her family or friends and they reminisce about her late husband) about the epic way he proposed and how touched she was. I just want to make it special for her but different than her late husband. If I'm making any sense. I bought the ring and picked it up today , I just needed some advice from reddit.

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [25M] of two years, he didn't celebrate my birthday for the second year in a row.


My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and we are looking to move in together. We've had some rough times with our relationship in the past, but it's been better lately.


Last year, he didn't celebrate my birthday and I was upset. It turned out that birthdays weren't a big thing for his family, and he didn't realise that I wanted to celebrate. We had a talk about expectations, and I told him that for a birthday I would like to go out somewhere to celebrate and to receive a card, and that if he chose to give me a gift I would like it to be wrapped and not presented in the shopping bag. I didn't feel like this was asking a lot.


This year, my birthday fell on the day of a friend's wedding, and my boyfriend was a groomsman. We talked about it in January and decided to celebrate the day after instead. We also talked about plans for celebrating at the wedding with his friends.


The day of my birthday/the wedding I got a nice text message and a 'happy birthday' in person at the wedding. We didn't sit together at the wedding but still had a nice time.


The day after, we were looking at some houses for rent. We had breakfast at a cafe that he chose that I paid for (we were in a hurry and he was in the bathroom). Afterwards, when I asked what his plans for the rest of the day were, he said he was going to the pub with his mates. He also told me he wasn't able to come to my family celebration the next day because he had work to do at home.


I feel really disappointed and hurt that he didn't celebrate with me, and frustrated that nothing has changed since last year. I feel thatI was really clear with my expectations, and that they were ignored. When I asked him why we didn't celebrate, he said he forgot and he was too busy with the wedding, but that's why we chose to postpone the celebration and he still did nothing.
 

How can I help him understand how upset and hurt I am, and how can we get back on track? I tried talking to him about it but he kept steering the conversation back to how bad he felt and how he didn't know what he could do now. He offered to take me out this week but I don't want it to feel like an afterthought and a burden, and would prefer to do nothing.

"I [17M] asked out a guy [17M] at my school but don't think I was clear enough about it being a date... or that I'm gay...


Closeted high school senior here! I'm still working on finding the right time to come out. Even though I think most people will be fine, I'm still scared about a few and what they might think of me. So as far as most people think, I'm straight. I generally act like a straight guy, and no one has ever suspected me of being gay (at least not to my face).

There's another boy at school who's openly gay, and I'll call him Joe. He came out at the beginning of high school, and I've kinda had a crush on him for the past couple years. I really admire him for being able to come out, and he's a really genuinely sweet guy and super fun to be around. My friend group kinda merged with his this past year, so we've started talking more and hanging out with groups of people. It's been great being able to spend time with him, but we're never alone together, and don't hang out one-on-one.

I've been super nervous about it, but I decided that I need to summon the courage to ask him out. I chickened out every time I saw him for like a week straight. Every time I'd have a chance to talk to him alone, I'd get butterflies in my stomach, then inevitably someone else would show up and I'd feel like I couldn't do it any more. 

Finally, yesterday I caught him alone at his locker at the end of the day. I was so nervous, but asked him if he wanted to come chill at my place sometime this week. He said that would be cool, and asked if I was having a few people over from our friend group. I kinda stuttered, but said no, and said that I just thought it would be cool to hang out because I don't think I've ever had him over before. He kinda just said, ""Umm ok,"" and that was that. 

I was so excited! He said yes! Err-- he said ok! But my problem is that the more I think about it, I think I really just asked him to hang out the same way I'd ask a friend I wasn't interested in romantically. I'm afraid that he is just gonna think I'm some boring dude and won't be interested in me. I really want to come out to him and tell him I have a crush on him, but I feel like I kinda asked him out in an awkward way. I wanted to play it cool and let on to the fact that I was asking him on a date without directly saying it. 

  ---

"I [23F] just found out I am adopted and my brother is making it all about him. Not sure how to move forward.


I was raised in a four-person family. There is my Mom [45F], my Dad [50M], and my brother Jake [25M]. I have grandparents on both sides, in their 60s, and cousins. I look a lot like my family, we all have dark hair, are tall, like sports. I always assumed I was biologically related and it never occurred to me that I was adopted. No one in my family mentioned it until a month ago. 

My Mom says she told me because my biological grandmother contacted her. So, she was afraid I would find out on my own. Which I guess makes sense. 

According to my Mom, it was going to be an open adoption, but then my bio-mom got sick and passed away when I was a year old. My bio-family asked to go no contact and my parents just decided not to tell me. 

Both my parents have said they know it was selfish, they didn’t want to hurt me, they intended to tell me at 18 but I was going to college, then things came up. So they didn’t. And they have apologized, said it was stupid, asked for my forgiveness, and I feel they just didn’t know how to tell me I wasn’t wanted by my biological family.

I am hurt, really hurt, but I don’t intend to cut out my adopted family. They are the only family I know and I feel, deep down, they truly didn’t want to see me hurt. And they were afraid that waiting so long would make it worse. And they were right. It’s just a big mess. 

The biggest issue is my brother Jake [25M] didn’t know either. He has taken it harder than I did, and has been going on rants to me about how he feels like his whole identity is gone. That not knowing I was adopted is something he doesn’t think he can forgive. And it pisses me off. Every time he says it I get madder and madder—not at my parents, but at him. 

It is fucking confusing. I love my brother, he is my closest friend. I love him to the end of the earth and back. *But* it feels like he is making this about him. And it’s not about him. He didn’t find out his birth family rejected him, or that his birth mother is dead. He doesn’t have to deal with changing his whole genetic history or what it means to be a Smith. All the really awesome ancestors I felt close to are now someone else’s ancestors and I know nothing about my birth family, other than a few names. 

I am fucking terrified what this means and he is telling me how he doesn’t know what to do with himself. And I just want to tell him to fuck off. This isn’t about him. He should be supporting me, not the other way around. 

I am just not sure how to tell my brother to back off. 

I know he has a right to be upset. And has a right to never speak to them again if that is how he feels.

I just... 

- I want him to stop telling me how to feel about this. I can keep them in my life if I want and I do want that. 
- I was lied to as well. I am his sister and not being told I am adopted doesn't make him less my brother. But everything I was told about my childhood/past seems like a lie and I must deal with that. I feel he is making this into his hero journey and it pisses me off. 
- I am not sure how to balance all this. I am super confused, super upset, super everything. 

What do I do? How do I even begin to unravel this whole fuckery? 

**TL;DR** Parents lied about my adoption my whole life [for a pretty heavy reason] and now my brother is making it all about him.

Been together for 5 and a half years and we were long distance.. I moved in with him about a year and a half ago, and in the beginning it was perfect. 

Long distance was always amazing.. We texted all the time, phone calls, all that all the time. It was perfect to me and I loved it.. But I was eager to move in with him, and he said the same. 

We talked about it for all of those years, wishing we lived together.. Saying we wanna spend all day together.. Ect ect.

Now we have this.. It's what we talked and dreamed about.

I noticed he hasn't been the same though, he spends a lot of time doing stuff by himself and usually our only time together is at night, when we get in bed and cuddle and watch a movie. 

We are still very obviously in love and I kinda just thought it was different because the honey moon phase is over, which makes sense. But I guess it's more than that. 

Finally I asked about it.. He was kinda emotional about it and he told me ""I'm sorry.. You're just.. Not as exciting as you were when we were long distance. It was fun all the time.. Visiting you was fun. I thought living together would be the same, but it's not."" 

He went on to say my personality is different in person and I'm not as fun and carefree, and I'm more serious and nervous and anxious all the time. Which I guess is true.. I worry a lot especially about what he thinks, and it does make me lame. 

I try to be fun, and I dress how he likes..i do my hair how he likes.. I clean the entire house, I take care of him and things that he needs. I thought he'd be happy having me live with him :(

I'm not sure what to do.. How do I act like I did when we were long distance? He said he's still in love with me and wants to marry me, but that living together just wasn't what he pictured. And he apologized a lot :(

Tl;dr; fiance says I'm not as fun as I was when we were long distance. I'm too serious and anxious. He doesn't seem to like me as much as he did in the beginning of livinf together. What the heck do I do??"

Hi there! This is a pretty minor problem in the grand scheme of things on this sub, but it'd be nice to get feedback.

I've been dating a guy for a couple months, and he's funny and wonderful and it's all been great. Today is my birthday and he has asked to take me out for dinner tomorrow, saying he can't wait to spoil me. This sounds like he will be paying, which he does often but I take him on dates and pay for them too, or pay half for dinner a fair amount of the time.

He said it'd be easier to go out near his house, and I agreed. He said ""I'll make a reservation at the chinese place!"" and I said yes in the moment. Now this sounds incredibly petty but I really don't fancy chinese food for my birthday. This place is somewhere we talked about trying but I have a weird steak-on-my-birthday tradition and I just really fancy it. Is it rude to ask if we can go to a steak place? I've looked up the restaurants nearby the prices would work out the same, and I'd be happy to pay for half, but I know he won't let me. I don't want to seem like I'm just nagging or trying to get a nice dinner off him!

Should I suggest going for different food or just be quiet and appreciate the nice date?

It's your birthday, I want to do whatever you want to do! There's a great steak place called blah blah..."" so he's still lovely and fantastic and I'm an idiot and you guys are all great. Thanks!**"

My boyfriend is one of the hardest working people I know, but based on the way he presents himself, you might think upon first meeting him that he is a lazy slob. 

He has shoulderlength brown hair and a scraggly reddish beard. 90% of his wardrobe is jeans and funny t-shirts. He has a couple of polos that I bought for him, and his work shirts. No slacks or khakis or anything.

For the majority of our relationship, I have overlooked this, because I know what a great person he is. However, a few things have happened over the past couple of years that have made it more of an issue, and we are now in a heated debate

* He wore jeans to my sister's wedding. Everyone let it slide because I told them it was all he had, but I did get a few nasty comments and he was not allowed to be with me in any photos. It was embarrassing.

* He recently missed out on a promotion at work. He asked his friend who knew the interviewer for some insight as to why. They said, verbatim, ""if he had worn a cleaner looking shirt and at least bothered to iron it, it would have gone a long way"". (He had worn a very wrinkled polo, and he and I had a fight about it before he left because I begged him to let me press it and he wouldn't.) I was embarrassed FOR him when I heard this feedback. He didn't seem bothered at all.

After the promotion thing we started to talk about it more, but he always gets extremely defensive and shuts me down for ""being ashamed of him."" I always feel really bad and I don't know what to say. He feels that because he is ""not in business"" and ""not customer facing"" (he works in a warehouse), his appearance doesn't matter. 

The truth is, I'm not ashamed of him. I love him. **But I am ashamed of the way he presents himself sometimes.**

He has never really been a sharp dresser, but when we first met he was much better about keeping his hair and beard cut. This has sort of phased out and he now gets a haircut about once a year.

The reason this has become such a hot topic lately is that I recently got promoted at my job. It is a higher level, corporate job and I consistently have to maintain a neatly groomed and well dressed appearance. As a result, we look like the odd couple out in public. That's not what's bothering me, though. What's bothering me is that when I inevitably bring him along to some work functions, I don't want to have to be ashamed of his appearance. **Appearances are very important at my job, and I don't want to feel like I need to hide my SO from my boss and coworkers.** 

Does this make me shallow? Am I wrong to expect him to at least perform the bare minimum of personal maintenance, to trim his hair and beard every few weeks, to at least own one necktie and a pair of slacks? I'm not asking him to dress to the nines every single day...I just would like him to dress up if the situation warrants it, like a job interview or a wedding or one of my work events.

When we first met in our mid 20s, this wasn't a huge deal, but now that we are 30 and I feel like we both need to stop dressing like we are teenagers. 

***TL;DR: I wish my boyfriend would cut his hair/beard and dress nice sometimes. He accuses me of being ashamed of him and not loving him for who he is when I bring it up. What do I do?!***"

"(UPDATE) Me [28 M] and girl I briefly dated [27/F]. Says she is pregnant.


Link to original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5atvin/me_28_m_and_girl_i_briefly_dated_27f_she_says_she/)

So almost four months ago I posted about how this girl I briefly dated texted me saying she's pregnant.  I didn't use protection which was really stupid and irresponsible.  She refused to send photos of the ultrasound that she supposedly received the day she texted me, and wouldn't meet up or talk on the phone.  I haven't heard from her since that day she broke the ""news"" in October.

Anyway, we're still friends on FB and I've noticed she has a new boyfriend (for about two months now).  She doesn't appear to have gained any weight that I can see, hasn't posted any statuses related to being pregnant, and also I saw a couple days ago she was in a bar with the new boyfriend and they were both holding bottles of beer.

So I'm pretty sure the whole thing was B.S. ?  If so, I don't know what the motivation was ?  I know she didn't want to keep on dating and we didn't have any crazy argument or bad blood.  

I've taken a screenshot of that photo of her with the beer and some other stuff, just in case, but yeah..thoughts?

"My [22M] girlfriend's [21F] dad [55M] is dying slowly and very painfully. I've never had to deal with a death before, so I feel helpless.


My girlfriend's dad has a very rare disease. Think something similar to ALS/MS. The disease essentially causes you to slowly deteriorate until you die. The disease is cripplingly painful. Typically, victims of this disease die within 5-7 years of the onset, although a small amount of people survive longer. My girlfriend's dad is in his 7th year of the disease and things are not looking good.

This has definitely caused some friction in our relationship. I've never had to deal with a close family member or friend dying, let alone to such an awful disease. I do, however, have experience with family members and friends contracting non-terminal diseases, disorders, cancer, etc. My grandfather has had 3 strokes and is barely functional. My grandmother has survived various cancers 5 times. My mother has a disease that she refuses to disclose to us because she believes it will kill her one day. My father is very unhealthy and will probably have a heart attack within 5 years. He also has a disease known as hemachromatosis which fucks up your body due to high iron.

My girlfriend is constantly depressed. I'm worried the loss of her father will lead to a deep depression. She is already very depressed. This depression is also the source of much anger. There are times where my girlfriend will break down over how she sees all these people that have healthy parents, while her dad is withering away. Sometimes she gets mad at me for having never had to deal with her father's disease. She'll say that I can never possibly understand what she's going through, and even though it's not my fault she is envious of my ""healthy"" parents. It affects on her a daily basis. At many of my family gatherings, she will mentally check out because she is surrounded by healthy family members and it causes her to remember her sick dad, which then depresses her. If she goes out to dinner with a friend, she will mentally check out because a night out seems so insignificant compared to her father's situation. Her dad always gains a lot of energy when I'm around, so I try to spend a lot of time with him so that my girlfriend can see him in a good mood. But, even spending time with her dad depresses her.

I don't know how to help. It seems that no matter what route we go, it will lead to more depression. I try to provide hope, offer new suggestions for ways to help (pain management, therapy, etc), and generally just try to comfort her. Whatever I do, though, it doesn't feel like it's enough. I'm worried my girlfriend is already well into a dark pit, and once her father passes away she'll never make it out. 

I don't know what to do, reddit. I don't know how to help my girlfriend out of this depression. I'm worried that I won't be able to offer enough to help her. Please help.

"I (20f) don't know how to get it through my friend's (27f) head that I am not interested in her ""catch"" of a friend (28m)


EDIT: thank you for all of the responses! I texted her and told her I will not be talking to him or trying to pursue a relationship with him and she said she understands and we left it at that. I plan on cutting her out of my life- many of you have brought to my attention that I shouldn't have to feel like this when it comes to a friendship and I agree! 

I (20f) just got out of a year and a half long relationship (thats another story). My friend (27f) and I just recently reconnected after a dramatic fallout (she's VERY immature, the only reason I haven't cut her off completely is because of how dramatic she is- at this point I'm just trying to be civil to avoid problems) and I brought up the fact that I was newly single. 

After telling her what happened between my ex and I, she gave my full name, phone number, and snapchat to this friend of hers who she swears is a catch and if she wasn't with her current boyfriend she would've gone for him. She also added that since I ""only date ugly boys,"" I won't care that he's unnattractive (????). After he added me, we had a VERY brief talk. He tried to be funny and I was too exhausted and uninterested to care. 

He's 8 years older than me and around the same age as my older brother and older sister. I have nothing against relationships with age gaps, but for me it would not work. I had posted a status on facebook about how I miss being in a relationship but I'm glad I'm single (I know, I disgust myself too) and she texted me.
-her: Woah, your post. I take it you didn't talk to my friend? 
-me: he has my snapchat and we talked briefly, but we haven't had a full blown convo. I feel like I'm too immature to be talking to him. I struggle with talking to guys even 2 or 3 years older than me, so this is difficult 
-her: blah blah blah. idk i think hes a catch. i really mean it. i want you to push yourself to do something different. i think you are mature and every dude you've been with isn't and they don't take you seriously. 

I ignored her, but this kind of thing happens ALL the time. I say no and she just won't take no for an answer. no matter what i do, she isn't going to be happy with it. If I were to get a new boyfriend, she would be mad that it wasn't her friend she's trying to hook me up with. What am I supposed to do to get it through her head that I cannot date someone thats nearly 10 years older than me?

TLDR: My friend (27f) insists her friend (28m) is a huge catch despite me voicing how uncomfortable by the situation I (20f) am. How can I communicate to her that I will not be pursuing a friendship or a relationship with him without making her upset?"

"I am madly in love with my wife (41f) but I am no longer attracted to her. How do I (44m) deal with this?


I've been married to Sara for 10 years, together for 13. She has my heart and she is my entire life. She's my best friend. Everyday we are together, I feel like I fall more in love with her. She's my soul mate. 

I'm struggling however, because for the last 2 years.. I have no attraction to her. I brushed it off in the beginning to me being depressed, but it never went away. I still have no attraction. 

She hasn't changed much, except what you would expect. She no longer looks like she did when we got together (and I never expected her to, I knew she wouldn't) and I don't know. I find her absolutely stunningly beautiful inside and in her personality though. 

I don't want to get divorced, because as I said..I'm madly in love with this woman. I'd never want to be with anyone else. She's even joked that she's old and I'll leave her for a 20something. And no..Absolutely not. I wouldn't take anyone over my wife. 

Weve been in marriage counseling for awhile now (more so for our religious reasons, not because of issues) and I privately discussed it with the counselor, but she was no help. 

What do I do? I feel like she deserves someone who is totally attracted to her in every single way. Please help. Am I a horrible person? 

Tl;dr; madly in love with wife of 13 years.. But no longer attracted to her. I feel like the worst man in the world. What do I do?"

"I [29F] was told by my bf [25M] (dating for 1 yr now) that he invited one of my colleagues [25F] over at his place so that he could brew her a cup of coffee on her b'day


Backstory: we don't live together. Once, last year, we happened to go watch a movie with two female colleagues who work in my department. He's from a different department and I introduced him as a friend.

Fast-fwd, he tells me today: he found out that one of these colleagues (his age and female) goes to the campus cafeteria at the same time as he does and he ends up talking to her on a regular basis. He says he enjoys her company. He tells me that it's her b'day tomorrow and he's invited her over to brew her a cup of coffee. I am in the same department as her and even I didn't know that it's her b'day tomorrow! Should I be worried?

She doesn't know that we are dating. Wouldn't somebody in her shoes take this the wrong way? As him asking her out for a cup of coffee? Especially after he's been bumping into her almost every day around lunch time? Or am I overthinking here? Am I being just insecure that he's found another girl whom he likes who happens to be younger than I? Any advice would be deeply appreciated. 

TL;DR: bf invited a female colleague over for coffee at his place on her b'day, tells me he talks to her regularly and likes her company. I feel that he's leading her on. And oh yeah, she's younger than I am. Please advice how to take this.

[edit1: I forgot to mention that I had already told him that she's just a colleague and not a friend. She is part of a group that I prefer not to hangout with. We just happened to go to a movie together once. That's all.]

[edit2: I told him about my feelings. He said he just wants to be friends with her. And that I shouldn't think more of it. He will let her know that he's in a relationship. Thanks for ur advice Reddit!]

[update: we broke up. Before u assume the worst, he did see how what he did could have been misleading. He changed the plans to brewing her a cup of coffee at his department later this week. But he said he doesn't want to do this relationship anymore because of my insecurities and how I overthought things :'( I plead guilty. When I told him that there should be some boundaries that shouldn't be crossed in a relationship, he said that it felt like I didn't want him to have any gal pals while I was just trying to ensure that he doesn't lead any other girl on  :'( if after 1 yr he felt that way, that I didn't have my best intentions at heart, I guess we are better off without each other. Bottom line: we had different expectations out of this relationship. Thanks for all your advice and support through this. It hurts like hell. So I am going to cry myself to sleep tonight. To be fair to him, he did tell me at the beginning of our relationship that he doesn't do relationships but that he was willing to give it a shot for me. So I don't blame him if he thinks this was unbearable. We gave it a shot. We are walking away from this with great memories. But he's back to being aversive to relationships and I think so am I. I feel horrible about that! I was the older one in this relationship here and I left him with an impression that relationships are not worth the effort! I let us down. Sigh. I just hope we go on to be better people. Let's get better, coz we are not dead yet!]
