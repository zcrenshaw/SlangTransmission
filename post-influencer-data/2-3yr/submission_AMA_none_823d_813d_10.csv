"I'm a former Uber driver who was attacked by his passengers. I was fired from Uber for carrying(not using) pepper spray to defend myself from a knife brandishing passenger.


So I have been driving for Uber for three years while going to school. It's a great student job because of the lack of schedule. Two years ago I was attacked, my glasses broken and got a nice shiner from a drunk and belligerent passenger. He was arrested and discharged from the navy as a result. Last week I had a passenger wielding a knife and throw a beer bottle at my car. I got away from the situation safely and was later fired for carrying pepper spray. AMA.  "

"I am a 31 year old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder)


My name is Justin. I'm 31 years old and I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder when I was about fourteen. In addition to living with the disorder, I know quite a bit about it from a theoretical perspective. 

Somewhat ironically, I have a Bachelors in Psychology and nearly completed my Masters in Counseling Psychology. Unfortunately, the stress of graduate school and a family crisis led to an increase in my dissociative symptoms and I was forced to drop out of my Masters program just one semester before completing it. 

I'm happy to answer any questions about my personal experiences, or DID in general. 

Edit: Sorry for disappearing abruptly. I had to get some sleep. I have some things I need to do today, but I will be around off and on and I'm happy to keep answering questions. "
