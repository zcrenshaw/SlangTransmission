"TIFU by grunting while getting a blowjob


So I'll start by saying that this happened years ago while I was still a teenager in high school.

I was dating a lovely lass, we'll call her Amanda, for just over two months. Her family went on a yearly trip to a roller coaster theme park.  It was roughly three hours away.  They invited me along and offered to pay for everything.  Honestly it was a great time.

 We left for our trip at around 2:30-3:00a.m. So we slept sitting in the back seat for most of the ride.  The park was a blast. Short lines, decent weather.  There from open to close. Afterwards we stayed the night in a Holiday Inn and left in the morning to return home. 

We were riding in Amanda's dad's company car. It was a white 2005 Cadillac sedan.  It was roomy but still not so much as to lay down unimpeded while sharing the back seat. Amanda's parents were in the front. Her dad was driving and she decided she was ready to nap. She put her head in my lap facing me and curled up in the rest of the bench style seat. 

She rested awhile but I guess she got bored and decided to play a road trip game to pass the time.  I wasn't aware we were going to play.  Amanda started sneakily caressing my manhood with the hand under her ""snoozing"" head. I responded physiologically rather soon, as teenage boys will do, and quickly outgrew my pants.  

Now, of course, I was nervous. I could see her parents and was occasionally engaging in small talk. Through the rearview mirror they could check back and see my face but not much lower. Amanda was wearing a hoodie with hood up and was laying mostly still.  All of this only added to the excitement though.  The risk was a reward to my adolescent mind and I sincerely doubted any repercussions.  

Anyways, my pants had seemingly shrunk and Amanda, having noticed my discomfort, took it upon herself to free me of their constraint.  Now feeling the fresh air was a relief but risk increased exponentially and so did the thrill.  Amanda must've felt exactly the same way.  So with thrill increased the obvious solution was to hide my exposed member in her mouth. I was not against this one bit. However I did have to bite my lip to stifle any verbal agreement to her action. 

We may have been young, and maybe because I was young, but Amanda was a goddess from the lips in. Every move she made was the exact right move.  There's something alpha and strange about seeing the back of someone's head while exploring the back of their daughter's head.  

So there I am.  Trying to look natural in case they use the rearview mirror.  Biting my lip, eyes wide open, mostly holding my breath.  Looking natural.  There she is. Looking asleep.  Head slowly bobbing.  Wet, soft, occasional, gagging noises.  Normal sleep stuff. I'm starting to get close.  Like three minutes in.  Severe lasting power for my teenage self. 

We had developed little signals for this situation.  The orgasm situation.  Not the blown near parents situation.  Worked for both thankfully.  Little double tap on her shoulder to alert her of incoming baby babies. Lucky for me she was of the habit of consuming these salty potentials. Which also was advantageous to this situation.  

Here's the fuck up.  I'm starting to climax.  Trying to summon lady gaga's best poker face. Holding my breath and turning red. I imagine my eyes rolled up into my skull for a brief moment because everything went black. I uttered a single soft grunt. The pivotal fuck up was less than a syllable. I re-focused on the mirror to find her father quizzically looking at me.  In less than two seconds, I'm not even through my throes, I fucked this entirely enjoyable situation up. With less than a syllable. 

I saw realization come across his eyes. Followed by anger. I hear a mutter of, ""wtf?"" I try to pull her head up just a bit. She slams back down in an attempt to contain catastrophe. However some little bit of catastrophe escaped.  A dime sized drop of milk gooey catastrophe landed just behind her hood. In plain sight of dad. 

Risk or danger tend to make sexual events that much more exciting.  It makes them feel explosively more intense.  Getting caught does not feel that way.  It's like coming to the brink of orgasm and then getting shot in the nutsack with a bb gun after the first gush. 

That little dime sized bit of full confirmation meant that I had to find my own way home.  No yelling. No berating. Just, ""Get out."" And I did just that. 

TL;DR

I got head in the back of a car that was being driven by the girl's parents and was caught just as I finished.  

Edit: Thanks kind stranger for the gilding."
"TIFU by having a cracked iPhone screen


So this literally happened 24 hours ago... hang with me on this one. I posted yesterday, but because of crappy formatting it was removed after 10 minutes. 

So.. resubmitted:

I go to a religious school, and it has a rather large church that we attend on Sundays, so a lot of time I browse Reddit. Past week I finally decided to make an account so I can upvote and comment and that sort of shit. 

Anyways... here's the story- I'm cruising old Reddit posts on /r/AskReddit under the top rated section, and reading the comments. 

I find the funniest comment to me for some reason which was ""Nothing puts me in the mood to fuck a pregnant stripper like Squidbillies."" So like a normal guy, I copy paste it to send to my friend down the row who is also on Reddit. 

But instead of iMessage, I have to hold it and send it as a text bc his data is off, whatever. But because of the cracks in my screen I accidentally pressed ""Speak"" which is next to ""Send as text message"" 

Then proceeds Siri's voice- echoing over the dead quiet sanctuary, down the balcony and off the walls: ""NOTHING PUTS ME IN THE MOOD TO FUCK A PREGNANT STRIPPER LIKE SQUIDBILLIES""

And 300 people all around me turn to see my face- red from embarrassment and eyes with tears because of how funny it actually was. 

So.. this morning after my first final exam I get a call slip to the Administration office and assigned 75 demerits and having my enrollment threatened if I let my phone scream about inter corse with pregnant strippers again. 

Fml 

EDIT: ayy thanks for the gold kind stranger! 

EDIT EDIT: it's a college and the church has maybe 6000 people in it

"TIFU by getting every field trip at my High School canceled for two years


In classic reddit fashion, T(en years ago) I fucked up by doing what I thought was a pretty innocent practical joke. I'm only just getting over the shame, so I guess I'm ready to make a throwaway and tell the story.

My entire junior class (~175 kids) was taken out to the ""big city"" to see some type of Shakespeare play. Not a broadway, but some truly awful back-woods theater production. So everybody is pissed that we didn't go see something cool. Perhaps because of that, and unbeknownst to me, a group of ~20 kids had smuggled booze into their backpacks and were getting drunk (The 16-year-old, ""God, I'm so drunk right now!"", but not actually drunk). So that's under wraps and none of the teachers find out.

Then the FU. I'm sitting at the food court of a mall on our way back home with my two best friends. One of them had bought this disgusting chocolate pudding that he didn't want. So I dared him to put some on the toilet seat of the restroom. He dared my other friend. My other friend double-dog-dared me. Knowing that you can't back down from a double-dog-dare, I knew I had to do it.

So I go in to the bathroom of the food court, put a little bit on the toilet seat, and a little bit on the wall. It's pretty minor, and I think ""Heh, did it, that's funny, and somebody could wipe this off with a napkin after they laugh about it. Maybe two napkins.""

Nope. As I'm sitting down at my seat, some employee runs screaming out of there, thinking it was real poop. Not bothering to check or reason it out. Just screaming. 

Then shit hits the fan. Teachers start randomly pulling kids aside and interrogating them. One was a former marine and he thought this was the single defining moment of his life. He goes ape-shit on everybody. I'm surprised he didn't start water-boarding people there.

It comes to light somehow that these kids have been drinking. So they are instantly blamed by the teachers but the students know it wasn't any of them (they were the cool kids). With 175 kids, the rumors are flying around real fast. We get herded into the buses immediately, and as soon as we got back, everyone was ushered into the auditorium for what were the worst hours of my life. Everybody was sitting there, and one or two kids would get called out at a time. When they came back in, another would get called out. This went on for about 3-4 hours; the complete trepidation was tangibly thick in the air. Fortunately, neither of my friends ratted me out. But all the kids who were drinking wound up with pretty severe punishments. 

All trips for the next two years canceled? Check.

Annual trip to the amusement park canceled? Check.

Senior trip canceled? Check.

People complained about poop-man for the next two years. Every time I heard that I would die of guilt on the inside. I was terrified of anybody finding out and me winding up suspended and not able to go to college. Hopefully I've passed the time horizon where anybody from my school will read this and laugh instead of going on a witch hunt...

TLDR Put some chocolate pudding on a public toilet during a field trip as a joke. Employees didn't get the joke and the school administration canceled every field trip from then on.

"TIFU by going home with young lass after a night of heavy drinking


Obligatory this wasn't actually today, but during my sophomore year as a newly initiated fraternity guy with a large ego and small alcohol tolerance. I've had to use a throwaway because this story (and the unfortunate pictures that go along with it) got pretty popular around my college and people will likely recognize the story.

We start out the night at the liquor store where one of my older fraternity brothers offers to buy me some booze if I buy him a six pack. Being around the age of 19, this was usually my only way to get booze for a party so I obliged. I had about $15 after his 6 pack of PBR, and as I was reaching for a 12 pack of Miller Lite, I see a neon sign warning me of their new special on boxed wine. I do a little mental math and realize I can get 5 whole liters of shitty wine for the same price as a 12-pack of beer. Impressed with my price per unit reasoning, I go with the bag of wine instead.

The night proceeds how you probably guessed it would for any 19 year old armed with 5L of wine and little to no experience with binge drinking. I drink about 3L of it and i'm spewing out of all ends as we leave the house party we were at. My friends were trying to drag me home but I wanted to stay. I am now drenched in shitty wine, and rolling around in the grass so my friends just fucking leave me there. Can you really blame them? 

I gained a second wind and somehow ended back up at the party, still covered in boxed wine and other juices I couldn't point out from rolling around the damp yard outside of a college apartment complex on a Friday night.

**Cue the young lass.**

Some backstory on her: She was a nice girl, but really really not my type and had been aggressively pursuing me all last year for a piece of the 5 inch prince but I wasn't really interested. Things changed on this night. 

She walked into the party and screamed when she saw me and came over and hugged me, ignored my dampness, and then sat down next to me at the party. Things progress and we're eventually making out and she's leading me away from the party towards her apartment.

She pretty much has to drag my toes up the stairs and then leads me into her lair to mate with me. She goes to the restroom and I strip down to my skivvies and slip into her bed to wait on what is to come. She returns from the bathroom and we start to do the kissing. 

After some light kissing and caressing of the 5 inch grinch she freaks the fuck out and screams at me to stop. I'm totally surprised at her total shift in mood, and was incredibly confused until she yelled at me to stop pissing in her bed. Sure enough, I look down and I have broke the levees all over her nice silk sheets. She's freaking the fuck out and me and pushing me out of her bed, and immediately pushes me into her restroom buck naked to finish pissing. I pretty much got it all out of my system on her 1000-thread count sheets but I figure i'll go along with the charade to keep up appearances. 

I sit down on the toilet, and that's all I remember until my 6'3 275 lb friend has to kick down the door to find me naked passed out on the toilet seat with my head resting on her counter. The girl had left her apartment after she couldn't get me to leave her bathroom and went back to the party and refused to deal with me (for good reason.)

I woke up the next morning in her apartment on the couch, in underwear that weren't mine, and her roommates (who I was still a stranger to) were giving me the worst glares of all time. I also reeked. Why, you ask? It wasn't the fact I was covered in cheap wine or my own urine. When I passed out naked on her toilet, I apparently decided to take a shit and neglected to wipe.

Don't be like me.

TLDR; Drank too much, went home with a girl, peed all over her and her expensive sheets, passed out in her bathroom, my friend had to come kick in the door to make sure I was alive, forgot rudimentary procedures while pooping."
"TIFU losing 3 pints of blood by sitting a steamless wine glass AND getting 300 stiches in my nose.


Warning it may get a little graphic.

Like the title states... had a few glasses of wine on Friday night and I wanted to play me some late night video games. Well got up glass in hand and put it down on couch and ran to the bathroom. Came back and sat right on the glass... Shattered the glass.  Total cut was about 5 cm wide and very deep. Yelled to my fiance to call the ambulance. It was a god damn blood bath. Almost hit an artery and my rectum... just barely missed. Thank god it could of been a lot worse. Over all avout 3 pints of blood were scattered around my house 

Speaking of worse. They stablized the bleeding in the ER on my ass and I was sent to a room for the night because I was scheduled for a rectalcolonospopy. I would be knocked out for it so not too bad. Could have even be released on Sunday! I kn9w I would be the butt of all the jokes...

Thats when I decided I needed to pee. looking back probably not my finest idea. I stood up and next thing I recall is being on the floor in a puddle of blood yelling for help. I must of lost conciousness when I stood up. I guess my nose wanted to get to get better aquanted with the floor. I wasnt scheduled as a fall risk ( 30s and healthy) but losing so much blood I should have been. I completely smashed my entire nasal cavity and spent 3 hours in surgery to repair both my nose and my ass... over 300 stiches inside my nose and upper lip. Not sure on my butt... all this because of a god damn wine glass. Really fucked up. 

Couldnt really link and tell story on my phone but proof of nose 

https://sli.mg/vydIT7 ... you'll have to take my word on the ass. 

**Edit:** Sorry for the title gore and spelling. I promise I do know how to spell. I kept the spelling shitty because I was/still am under heavy meds and on a tiny phone. I can fix it when I get on a computer. 

Some guy said the story is BS... added one more pic because this shit hurts https://sli.mg/lrX6mt"
"TIFU by giving my girlfriend a concussion.


2013

I was delivering pizzas during my final year of college.  It was the Friday right before winter break.  Most of the students had gone home already.  I was working a little that weekend and would head home in a couple days, or that was the plan anyway.

It was also one of the shittiest, coldest, iciest winters Michigan has ever seen.  I feel like I say that every year, but this one sticks out to me.

You see where this is going.  

It's about 8pm, very dark.  I'm delivering to the northern bordering town, so nowhere really near campus, and there are no street lights on this freeway.  The road is empty, which ended up being a good and a bad thing.  

It wasn't snowing, and there wasn't any snow on the ground, so it never occurred to me that there was a shit load of ice everywhere.  I was going about 60mph when I caught some black ice, spun out, and I remember this clear as fucking day.  As I'm spinning towards this guard rail, right before impact, I calmly mutter ""fuck.""

It was fucking lights out.  I'll never really know how long I was out for, I'm guessing maybe 10-15 minutes or so.  I remember coming to and being completely fucking delirious.  I shouted out my two younger brothers' names to make sure they were ok, but of course they weren't with me.  Then I yelled my girlfriend at the time's name, same thing.

Then I looked down at my bloody pizza shirt, and then it hit me.  I wasn't drunk.  I was delivering pizza to some poor hungry guy that isn't eating tonight, unless he wanted my mangled face goo all over it.

All of that took about another 20 minutes for me to realize what happened and to pull myself out of this thing that used to be a car.

I hobble onto the freeway and just start walking aimlessly.  I'm still pretty wasted from the impact, but I have no idea how I'm walking right now.  I just know that I need to get to a hospital.  Must have been the adrenaline.  Also I was wearing boots, like tight laced boots, and they were both missing, as if they had been thrown off.  I never found them.

Honestly, as soon as I got up, I saw headlights.  I ran my torn up zombie looking ass self to the middle of the road, which was probably real stupid too, and flagged this guy down.  He took one look at me and said ""holy shit dude, get in.""

I sat down, called my brother off of this guy's phone, but I couldn't remember his number for the longest time.  I was loopy from the head impact.  Finally got in touch with him, told him to tell mom and dad and my girlfriend, to let them know what happened.  Then the pain finally set in.  I had my affairs in order, and now my body decided to betray me in the worst most painful way.

Once flushed with adrenaline, I was rendered useless and motionless by the time we reached the hospital.  I had to be carried very carefully, as they thought I might have had a broken neck.  The right side of my face was so swollen and my right ear was bleeding from the inside.

I'm lying on this hospital bed, and then I get the pain meds.  I kinda nod in and out, and then I see my girlfriend come in the operating room or wherever I was.  She takes one look at me, I'm high as fuck at this point, I go ""whatsup dude,"" and giver her a wink, and she faints and slams her head on the floor.

I wake up later about an hour away, they were going to airlift me but instead opted for an ambulance to take me to another hospital that had a trauma center.  I was apparently really fucked up, internally bleeding, but somehow managed to not break a single bone.

I'm really sore, can't move, have a pencil width tube in my cock hole, and I look over and my girlfriend is sleeping on this shitty chair beside me.  

Doctor comes in almost right after I woke up, told me what happened and that I should be dead as fuck.  I mean, he really hammered that point home.  Said he'd never seen anyone survive a crash like that, let alone not break anything or have any major injuries.  I was just in so much pain.  He told me something along the lines of ""you must have a guardian angel,"" as he checked my catheter and saw my darwin fish tattoo on my thigh.  awkward...

I took a moment to myself, sobered up a bit, and had a little cry to myself after my brush with death.  The pictures of my car are pretty awful to look at.  The entire right side of it was completely smashed in from the guard rail, leaving just inches for me to fit.  Looking at it I have no idea where I fit myself.

I suffered from dizzy spells and extreme pain and anxiety for about 6 months, and didn't drive for like a year, but I'm all better now.  My jaw clicks a lot, that's all.

Anyway, my girlfriend got a concussion and it was all my fault.  She decided to marry me though so that's dope.

TL;DR

got mangled in a car wreck, girlfriend saw me on the operating table, fainted, now we're getting married.  got a newer, better pair of boots.  swag bitch.

"Tifu by drowning the company car


[Update] Sorry this is later coming out than I wanted. I have been on conference calls much of the day. The car does not start, but the mechanic thinks it can once he finds the fault. Probably water in the motor. Company policy has changed regarding driving during the night. We wrote a incident report, attached photos, and sent that in. That actually went over well and at least some people understood our thought process. Not fired for now. Thanks (most) everybody for the advice, well wishes, and chuckles.



So I was driving a developmental car on a predetermined route. These cars are not cheap, R&amp;amp;D cars doubly more so. The route has us take a road behind some houses. It is dark and had been raining. The road is not great and I am driving slow. There is a big puddle in front of me. My coworker and I get out, it looks like it isn't too deep, maybe to the undercarriage. Yeah it was more than that. The motor dies which takes electric down.  Bye bye breaks. I quickly put on the e-break but by then it was too late. Coworker gets out to push it back. Yeah not happening. Water is maybe knee high and by now the whole car is flooded. We were able to push it far enough that the engine compartment was out of the water, but all electronics were down. I am writing this as we wait for the tow truck. I am so fired.

Edit update: Thanks for the kind words. Since it is the weekend a mechanic from the company will look at it on Monday. Decisions will be made then. As for the spelling errors above I will leave them, but please know I am on mobile with autocorrect and was a bit emotional at the time (I still might be). Sorry I can't include pictures. I would be fired for sure then. "
"TIFU by kicking a child in the face whilst on the toilet...


Reddit, today (yes really today) I fucked up. I work on retail and unfortunately that means public restrooms. Now, as everyone knows, you do not tell the asshole how to do his job.....when he says time to go it's time to go. Now as I sit down for a relieving session I hear a couple of unaccompanied youths enter....they begin pulling hands full of towels, randomly flushing toilets and turning sink on. I don't care, not my job to care.
     
   Next one of the little shits (the kids....) bends and pops his head underneath the stall I am currently conducting business in, I simply give an inquisitive ""the fuck dude?"" and he sniggered and got away, guessing his buddy had to one up him and poked his head under, waved and greeted me.

Here is where I should pause to add, I've been seriously in a shitty mood lately...Due to life and the trials that come with it and I'm known to be a bit of an ass. I put my foot his forehead, and pushed him away (some, apparently call this a kick to a little kids face... Not me but some). This causes him to stumble and jerk away to try to catch himself, smashing his face in the wall causing a massive nose bleed......FUCK.

spent a few hours with management in conversation with HR and thought I would suffer some bad consequences (mom was not happy with me ""kicking"" her snowflake) but worked out in the end, management finally saw my side after they took time to hear me out....

Tl;dr kicked a kid in the face, made him bleed....Got away scott free"

"TIFU By eating a kiwi fruit, skin and all.


Yesterday, I was browsing /r/AskReddit, when I came across [this little gem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5i5csd/what_is_your_i_know_it_sounds_weird_but_just_try/db5hj8y/) So just about thirty minutes ago, I went into the kitchen, where we just so happened to have a few kiwi fruits, ripe for the taking. 

Que fuckup. 

I washed it, took a bite of it, and enjoyed every bit of it. Up until I finished the fruit, at which point I noticed that my tongue started burning, then stinging, all coming from the hairs on the fruit. Next thing I knew, I was over the kitchen sink, letting water pour into my mouth. It still burns. I'm here typing this with a burning sensation on my tongue, I hope it's not permanent.

TL;DR: Tiny hairs poked my taste-tentacle, now it burns.

EDIT:~~Obligatory~~ Huh, i posted this and went to sleep, next thing i know, i got my front page cherry popped. Thanks, /u/charlychuckle! I'm glad so many of you got enjoyment out of my misfortune. Now i know that I'm allergic to the skin of a kiwi fruit. I will now proceed to reply to most comments.

I'm also leaving Que there.

Alright, alright, i get it, I'm allergic to the nutsack of the gods. And no, i don't have problems with latex."
"TIFU by shitting on my boyfriend's dick. NSFW


**Edit: So I just learned about the Jared-subway-thing. I'm not american, so I had no idea. To me it's just a name. Carry on!**

Yes, this is an anal story. Let's do this.

It happened with my boyfriend of now 4 years; we'll call him Jared. He was my first at pretty much everything, but he was sexually active long before he met me. One day, around 3 years ago, we were watching a movie where a group of people discussed anal, and I realized that in the time Jared and I had been together, we'd never tried it, and hardly talked about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I asked him if he had tried it with another girl before, if he liked it and what he'd think about trying it with me. He had not tried it with another girl, and to be honest, he said, it had been a consideration of his to try it with me for a quite a while. He just didn't feel the need to bring it up at that point, because we were experimenting with other things as well. 

A few days pass, and I spend some time reading about anal online. At this point, I'm determined to give us this experience: I buy a completely new kind of lube, I practice washing myself way further up than usual, and I wear the buttplugs we already had for far longer, without anybody knowing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, Friday arrives and I decide, this is it. I'm excited and nervous, but I eventually tell Jared about my plans, and invite him to the bedroom. Boy doesn't object: I got this. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's difficult. Much more complicated than a buttplug: a penis is actually attached to something and completely out of my control. Also, he was clearly excited about the situation, so he was a bit larger than he used to be. However pleasant that sight is, it was pretty inconvenient. 

He moves too fucking much, trying to make it pleasant for me. Sweet, but I can't feel anything but pain, and I eventually have to ask him to get completely still so I can figure this out. Furthermore, we probably didn't use enough lube. 

We try a few different positions, but they all hurt after a few seconds. I finally decide to get on top of him, with my backside to his face. Alright, perhaps this works. I get going and he seems to be enjoying it; I'm just trying to get used to the feeling, but at least it doesn't hurt that much... Until after about 30 seconds, and I decide I can't take it anymore, and I jump off to sit on his stomach for a break. 

&amp;nbsp;

*And I freeze at the sight of what was before me.* 

&amp;nbsp; 

**His entire dick was covered in a thick coat of feces.** With clear signs of our dinner last night. 

I don't know what to do. What do I tell him? I'm blocking his view, so he doesn't know what's going on. I soon realize I have to tell him. There's no other way around. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Why did this happen? What did I do wrong? Everything was fine, why the fuck did this happen, holy shit! 

&amp;nbsp;

I close my eyes and say, as calmly as I can, with a shaking, crackling voice; 

""Jared. Do **exactly** as I say. Get out of bed very slowly and carefully, walk to the bathroom, **do not touch or go near anything,** and clean yourself thoroughly in the shower. And whatever you do, **do not look down.** Are we clear?""

And he starts laughing. My heart is beating so fast I can feel it pounding in my chest. My face is warm, my hands are shaking and my ass **fucking. Hurts**. And he belly-laughs at me, knowing exactly what happened. I'm so embarrased I'm almost crying, but his warm laughter eases me and I end up chuckling along as well, while tearing up. I'm completely beside myself. This was not part of the plan. Screw this.

&amp;nbsp;

He does as I say: he doesn't look down, he walks slowly to the bathroom, and takes a nice, long shower. He won't shut up about it, though. He asks me why I'm embarrassed and tells me everything's cool. He invites me to join him in the shower, he hugs and kisses me and laughs at the whole thing. I'm still in panic-mode. I just want to go to bed and watch some movies: maybe order take-out. Forget everything. 

A few days later we try anal again, and this time, without any ""interference"". I guess mission is completed, right?...

&amp;nbsp;

But he won't ever let me forget it, of course.

To this very day, every once in a while, when I'm cooking, or working, or watching something, he sneaks up behind me, pulls my hair gently aside, and whispers softly in my ear: *""Do you remember that time you took a shit on my penis?""*


&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: I tried anal with my boyfriend and ended up unintentionally covering his penis in my feces. To this day he still mocks me about it. It's the small things in life.**

"TIFU by not mentioning my gender online


Actually goes quite some way back, but here goes: When I get to make a character online, I went for females. Now, before you ask, yes I am male, and no I am not making these characters due to my rampant homosexual desires or my suppressed desire to be another gender. It was simply because I felt that in games, men were portrayed as 'powerful', and women were portrayed at 'beautiful'. I never liked projecting myself onto the characters, and the male body seemed unappealing and over-bulked, so instead I'd spend my time making some barbie doll look nicer, if anything. You are permitted to laugh.

Regardless, I never had the intent to catfish anyone. I did do the occasional Role Play, but when it came down to everyone's identity, I easily confessed I was a guy playing the girl ""cause the curves are nice"". Hardly ever gotten any problems with this. Heck, it's still a common joke among a few of my friends.

However, this all changed when ~~the outdated joke attacked~~ I started playing a game called Uncharted Waters Online. Was a weird game, but I got to be in a ship. Being a captain was good fun, and I still sail to this day, albeit in actual ships now. Once again a female character, but I saw no harm. A bit of socializing here and a few broadsides there caused me to get a nice circle of friends going inside the game. However, one friend I made was a bit weirder at the time.

As someone who has been to and lived in quite a bit Asia before, I was happy to gain a friend in China. The guy was civil and friendly, if not a bit somber. Apparently in a rough patch in his field of study, and he felt like he didn't know what his next steps are. Naturally, as the 'sunshine in the room' (read: obnoxiously optimistic) I was all to happy to chat with him about his life and skills. Here is where the real fuck up happened. It was so normal for me to mention early into knowing someone that I was actually male, that when I talking these deep conversations with my Chinese Friend (who I will name Ling for convenience) I forgot I hadn't mentioned it. Now, a lot of people will follow the mantra ""There are no girls on the internet unless proven otherwise"", but the same could not be said for Ling.

Our friendship lasted for nearly half a year, with me knowing a lot about him and his life. When he asked about where I lived or what I did, I generally said I lived in some city in Germany. Technically, I wasn't too far off, since I lived in the Netherlands close to the border. I visited the town not too infrequently, so I knew my details. If in the end I wanted to meet someone in real life, those extra km wouldn't matter, but if the person tried to hunt me down, they'd never think to look across the border. To be fair, I think the fact that I didn't want anyone to know my personal details combined with the fact that I actually wanted to help him with his personal problems, caused this situation to escalate. Talking so little about myself allowed half a year to pass without either realizing the mistaken gender assumption.

Now at this point, I realized: He didn't think I was male. He honestly believed I was female. I don't know at which point I had my first suspicion, but I was sure of my case when he started sending me messages involving his reproductive system, my *obviously* humid reproductive system, and whatever happens when you throw those two together. Here I made my second big mistake. I back-pedaled, but I simply mentioned that I wasn't comfortable discussing such topics. I didn't mention I was male. I was deeply afraid that if he realized that his virtual crush was another guy, I'd undo all the confidence and progress I made on his life. So I played the part and tried to bring the heat down a few notches. Tried to untangle myself from the web, after which I'd vanish from his life, leaving behind a better man.

Until, at one point, Ling was convinced: I must have been some angel sent from heaven to guide him to the better path. Having heard of the German education system (which honestly is pretty sweet), he was convinced that he should move to Germany. Naturally, close where I was living. He knew I wasn't of age, but he was sure that we could at least get to know each other better until I was. After which, we would get married and he would take care of me until the end of days.

Sounds like a perfect plan, right? He had it all worked out. Despite his problems with his education, he never really had any problems with money. I was honestly convinced that in his eyes, he would do me a favor. The problem was unfortunately that I wasn't who he hoped I was. Where before I was slowly backing away, now I was running away screaming. Technically, at that point, I could have mentioned my gender, but I was stupid enough to hope that if I could make him calm down for now, I might find a better time to tell him, to make it less crushing. I flatly refused to tell him my address when he asked me, telling him I did not feel comfortable at all with such an extreme step. He told me he had patience, and would wait for me as long as I needed.

Here my second habit at the time came in handy. My father was a huge stickler for internet security. Having worked companies with rather strict NDAs, he had to make sure that there were no data leaks. He had me take up the habit of putting all personal data on a secondary hard drive. I can leave it near my PC, but don't plug it in unless I am going to transfer data, and always check your PC for viruses before you do. Don't leave any personal data on your PC if you don't immediately need it. His advise was ""Long term infection is rare. You'd need to ignore all the warning signs and payloads, and also actively ignore your anti-virus. The real danger are the ones which operate in a human's reflex time. A virus can do many things between the moment you downloaded it and the moment you realize it. Don't assume you are immune, because nobody is."" So I never kept data linking to myself on my PC.

As you can guess from my previous explanation, Ling tried to hijack my data from my PC. He was a software engineer, and in the half year I knew him, it wasn't uncommon for me to look at his programs he made and discuss them. So when he sent me a program after the incident, I thought it was his way of making up. When I ran it, I recognized the warning signs pretty quickly: He was taking every document and picture, and trying to download it all to his PC, just to find some personal information. However, there was almost nothing. Just a school report and some pictures of the game. But my name was under the school report. My name which happens to sound particularly non-female. Oh, and the report was in Dutch.

I wish shit had hit the fan right then and there, but it didn't. He didn't even seemed upset at first, and just asked an explanation. I explained my case, mentioning that it was originally never my intent to hide my gender from him. But he understood now. He had apparently gotten my IP already in the past, but thought I was operating through a proxy. After all, my IP was Dutch, yet I said I was German. He was desperate to find some way to trace me, or he wouldn't have used a virus. But with the IP and my name, he knew enough now. He said the sweetest yet scariest thing I had ever heard from a stranger:

""I honestly don't care how you look, how old you are, or even what your gender is. I didn't fall in love with your body, but with your mind. My love is not so fickle that I would not accept you knowing this. We can still get married in the Netherlands anyhow, so it's not as if the law will stop us.""

His tickets to Germany was set. All he had to do is book a bus to the Netherlands. I begged him not to fly, that I would not have a life with him. He told me he didn't care, he had to be with me anyways. I told him I'd go to the police if he didn't stop. He asked me to meet me half way then, somewhere in Germany. I asked him not to contact me anymore. He told me I'd change my mind once we met face to face.

The flight date came, but he never showed up. I had informed the police, and they were so kind to keep a look out for an Asian man of his description, but somehow I think he never made that flight. I think moments before the flight date, he realized the misery he was causing me, and just stopped his plans. He hadn't come online ever since. Some parts of me are glad, but some parts of me wonder if he's OK now. Maybe he actually is studying happily in Germany, and some day I'll get a mail from him, and we can laugh about all this and split ways again.

**TLDR: Accidentally catfished a stranger, who then became determined to meet and marry me. When I told him I was a boy, he told me he didn't care.**"

"TIFU by attaching my girlfriend's new dildo to my forehead.


So last night my gf got a new dildo in the mail. It's her first one, and I've never seen one in person before. It's one of those suction cup dildos that you can stick on the wall or wherever. I decided to test it out, and being the 12-year-old I am, I stuck it right in the middle of my forehead. I was the glorious and rare Dildicorn! I thought it was so hilarious, and I even took photos. She didn't think it was as funny, so she pulled it off my head. Well good news: the suction cup works great! Now I have this HUGE bruise right in the middle of my forehead! This was like 14 hours ago, and it's still there! Now I have to avoid explaining to my coworkers why there's a hickey in the middle of my forehead.

TL;DR - got a forehead hickey from a dildo.

"TIFU by thinking I was skilled at archery


Rewind it back to this time last year: I was back home for a few days before my exams, and I was really stressed out by all my schoolwork and various other things. I needed to relieve some stress. Bad. So, what better way to do that than by grabbing the ol' archery kit and shooting some arrows?! I was always a pretty decent shot before, so I just assumed that my skills were innate and were always with me. I used to shoot on a target, but we just left it outside and eventually the elements did their thing, and it pretty much rotted. So, I found an old basketball in the bushes and decided to shoot at that. Not wanting the neighbors to get suspicious, I decided to shoot on a narrow path beside the house where no one could see. I kicked the ball about 20 ft in front of me in a nice, tight space between the house and the bamboo. Easy shot. I loaded up the bow and aimed at the ball and let go. Next thing I know there is smoke everywhere and I don't know why. Well, I soon realized I had missed the ball terribly and instead had a perfectly accurate shot at the AC unit's copper piping, puncturing the pipe and letting freon escape everywhere. I had no idea what to do, no one was home, so I ran inside and turned off all the electricity in the house, and that ended up stopping the smoke. After an earful from my parents everything ended up being ok, and luckily the damage was just enough so that the whole thing didn't have to be replaced.
