"TIFU by deleting Reddit's #1 top post of all time


Happened just now. Sorry for my possible slips as English is not my mothertongue. I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

I've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.

Later in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.

I'm sorry. I didn't want to. Please, forgive me everyone.
I'll commit Sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.
If somebody working for Imgur sees it here, please, report it to who it would be most appropriate.

**TL;DR: I deleted Reddit's [#1 top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/62sjuh/the_senate_upvote_this_so_that_people_see_it_when/?sort=new) picture by playing around with Google sign-in on Imgur.**

P.S.: resubmitted because it didn't have TL;DR in the beginning

Edit: link for clarification (try clicking the original ""Senate"" post's title link).

Edit 2.0: **I guess *I am the senate* now**

Edit 2.6.5.32: I submitted the bug to Imgur's contact form just in case...

Edit 4.1.15: **just got from work to find a message from [u/_BindersFullOfWomen_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_BindersFullOfWomen_) on the behalf of Imgur's team, so the bug seems to be closed by now, the picture's back too** That's pretty cool and fast of a reaction for such a huge service, especially for me since it's already post working hours for me (I know, I know, time zones'n'shiiieeet).

Edit over 9000: [to all the guys telling me about the difference between Seppuku and Sudoku](http://i.imgur.com/fs3Lkmj.png)

Edit from the high ground: What the heck? Gold, 30K+ updanks, /r/all and numerous crossposts? **IRONIC**

Edit from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away: **holy shit, now [the title of the Imgur post attached to the original Senate one](http://imgur.com/ChYwfMq) has my username engraved into it!**"
"TIFU by honey dicking my wife after she found my used condoms...NSFW


Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

I went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

Fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

TL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.

"TIFU by accidentally emailing everybody in my dept a chapter of my pornographic Harry Potter fanfiction.


This happened 2 hours ago.

I was emailing a .txt containing the latest installment of my fanfiction to myself because I'd written it on my laptop and I wanted to edit it on my desktop.

But I typed in my work email by accident. It's extremely similar to my personal email, but my work email automatically forwards every incoming message to everyone in my department. Didn't even think about it.

I've never actually gotten physically sick because of a mistake before. The panic has died down a little. I've begun to accept that this is my life now.

It's not even tame porn you guys.

I'm going to resign tomorrow, early in the morning, by means of a letter; leave my keys to the building in the envelope; and go back to get a different degree. I've been thinking about doing it for a while. Guess I don't really have a choice now.

**TL;DR:** Sent a chapter of my Harry Potter porn to my coworkers earlier today. Going to resign in disgrace tomorrow.

---

**EDIT:** Thank you guys for all the advice and reassurance you've offered. You have no idea how much I needed it. I feel a little more human now, but this thread has gotten away from me. 

I still plan on resigning. I liked my job, but my boss will hear about this one way or another and as much as I appreciate all of the lies you've suggested, I honestly can't lie to her. I'm a shitty shitty liar and she's a very sharp woman. I won't get fired, she'd never pay unemployment as long as she lived, but I can't hope to move up in this particular company after something like this, and my life could get very difficult where I'm at.

I intend to go back to school. It's what I've been wanting to do for a long time, but I never had the courage to move forward with it. Fortunately the nearby college has a good nursing program and I'm taking steps to register for Fall.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go lie in bed and stare at the ceiling."
"TIFU by going permanently deaf after intense sit ups


I was on my last exercise, which was just your regular old sit up. I get to the point where I can barely finish a full sit up, pushing myself hard to finish the last few, when I feel a pop in my left ear. My ear starts ringing. Nothing else was wrong with me though, so I shrugged it off, quit my workout, and went to sleep about an hour later.

It's 6 am when I wake up. I look at the time, but I notice everything around me seems to be spinning. I also realize the sound of every movement I make only seems to reach my right ear. Something was definitely wrong, and I immediately remembered the pop in my ear the night before. At this point I'm not *that* worried yet.

But I start googling my symptoms, as you do. I usually don't get too affected by all these ""*you have cancer*"" or ""*you're going to die!*"" diagnoses you always find, but this time it struck me that everything definitely pointed to a serious issue: a fractured round or oval window. This can cause serious hearing loss. By now, I also found out that every movement I make causes intense vertigo and nausea. This is the point I start panicking a bit.

After a visit to the doctor, a nice morning of throwing up from nausea, and then a hospital visit, I'm told that it is probably exactly what I thought. Apparently it is extremely rare, but this can happen during a workout. I'm given steroids for a higher chance of recovery and get sent home. Two days later I get a call from the doctor, asking if I can have surgery the next day. She explained it didn't feel right to her and she wanted to diagnose the problem and possibly fix it as soon as possible.

I had the surgery, and everything seemed healthy. She explained that this meant it was likely indeed a fracture in the oval window. Fractures can be so small, it's possible you will never locate them. During surgery, she something to the oval window to increase the likelyhood of recovery, but that's all she could do.

Now, after more than a month of recovering from the vertigo I can do basically everything I used to be able to. Hearing in my left ear is gone. I've been told that it's very unlikely to recover. My balance is still somewhat off but I've been told I'll get used to that. I'm already mostly used to it. Hearing with just one ear has many downsides, and don't get me wrong it fucking sucks, but I've learned to live with it already. Well, other than the fact that I am now somewhat terrified of the thought of this happening to my right ear as well.

Now what irrationally stings the most about this whole ordeal. I'm a big Linkin Park fan. I had even pre-ordered the collector's edition of their last album. This story happened the day before the Linkin Park concert in Amsterdam that I had tickets to. I obviously couldn't go. It's a selfish thought, but it really fucking stings now that I know it was the last opportunity to see them live.

*****

**TL;DR
I was working out using bad form and breathing techniques, feel a pop in my left ear, wake up deaf the next morning with extreme vertigo. Had surgery and medicine, but to no avail. Am deaf in my left ear now.**

*****

Edit: wording and spelling

Edit 2: some people asking what the TIFU was... I mean I literally did sit ups so hard and with wrong breathing techniques  that I put too much pressure on my head and ripped a vital part of my left ear. I think that counts, even if some bad luck is required as well.

***Edit 3 (now bolded because this is important): To those saying ""Another reason not to work out"" and actually mean it: I was incredibly dumb. Please remember that. I held my breath, which is dumb. I kept going when my body barely could, which is dumb. I strained all my muscles to get those last few sit ups out, which is dumb. Etc. Working out doesn't cause this. Being a dumb fuck who doesn't know what he's doing causes this.***

Edit 4: Thanks for the 2x gold! Don't really know what to say. Really appreciate it!

And another Edit, number 5: FRONTPAGE! :o I really appreciate all the kind words. Everyone wants to give me advice and help me, and that's amazing. The internet isn't always a shitty place after all. Also love all the messages I got! Don't have time to read them all right now, but I will tomorrow!"
"TIFU by having shower sex and almost killing myself


In classic TIFU fashion, this happened 3 years ago:


It was my junior year of college and I found myself having regular coitus sessions with a woman. A human woman! Things were going great, but we decided to make things more interesting.


In my mind, shower sex had always seemed like a good idea. I had seen videos of it and heard stories about it, so when she suggested we try it out I agreed instantly. I really should have done my research.


At this point in my life, I had my own bathroom that had abysmal ventilation, but it had a shower/bathtub combo so we decided on using my place. I guess I conflated the ideas of sex being hot and temperature being hot because I cranked the shit out of the heat in that shower.


2 minutes later and we've begun the act. The act itself was rather unpleasant. The plopping and squishing noises of our wet bodies were completely unexpected. As a tall dude, I have to like semi-squat behind her. After about 5 minutes or so we get into a groove and I can feel myself nearing completion, but I also start feeling very weird. Between the squishing, the squatting, the thrusting, and making sure nobody gets waterboarded accidentally, I realized I hadn't taken a breath in about 45 seconds. This sexual experience had been an entirely anaerobic experience for me and I just realized.


As the bald man is about to cry his first tears, I desperately gasp for air. The steam in the bathroom is now a dense fog that contains little usable oxygen. Immediately, every muscle in my body simultaneously cramps. I fall out of the shower while decorating a wall with a Peter-Parker-esque web. At this point, my muscles are too fucked to even attempt to stand, so I begin a last ditch effort to crawl to open that door while still cumming. My partner is visibly horrified and shrieking as she watches my wet, doughy, pale ass slide like a slug to the door, leaving a trail of water and my own ejaculate.


After I managed to get out of the bathroom, I lost consciousness about 4 feet from the door. When I woke up, the girl was dressed and ready to leave. In my exhaustion, I mumbled a goodbye to her and waved as she departed. I always think about that goodbye from her perspective; a giant half-conscious naked man lying on the floor covered in his own semen waving goodbye. She might still be in therapy working out that image.


Tl;dr had shower sex and cramped up/passed out from a lack of oxygen, having to crawl out of the bathroom while still ejaculating, 6/10 experience overall"
"TIFU by coming home to my parents house high and forgetting to disconnect my Bluetooth on their speaker

"TIFU by telling my supervisor that his wife(also mother of two) is a cheating bitch.


I'll start with some quick backstory. I recently moved and took a pretty good job sandblasting in Greensboro. Probably the best job I've had so far. The crew I work with are pretty cool and the job itself is pretty fun. My supervisor has a goofy/comedic personality but does a great job balancing that side of him while also being a good supervisor, so this to me is perfect. 

So earlier today my supervisor and I were chatting during our break and somehow got on the topic of cheaters/breakups . I mentioned to him a relationship I had 15 years ago where I was cheated on. He asked if I ever got back in touch with her and I said no. He then asked if I ever looked her up on Facebook, and I told him I  never had urge to want to see her again and called her a ""cheating bitch"" (big mistake this was.) So after pushing me to look her up, I get on FB and look her up and sure enough I find her(The profile pic was just of her). I show him the picture and he starts laughing thinking it's a joke. He then asks how I knew she was his wife? So I also start laughing thinking he's joking with me. 

I scroll over to the next profile picture and see them together with their kids. I've never felt such a feeling of confusion and fear like this in my life. I immediately remembered hearing from a friend a while back that she ended up moving to Greensboro but i completely forgot about that when I moved. I apologize to my supervisor but my mind was so shocked I'm not quite sure I was making sense. He seemed to take it ok and said it's not a big deal, that this was a long time ago. And we went back to work. 
 
So now I'm freaking out about if he's gonna tell his wife (my ex) about what happened and how she's gonna react. He seemed fine leaving work but if it was me I'd be wondering all sorts of things about our past relationship that would eat at me. What are the chances something like this happens? Why couldn't I have pulled up the profile pic first and just keep my mouth shut. Tomorrow should be interesting. 

TL;DR Moved for a good job. I called my ex a ""cheating bitch"" in a conversation at work. Found out she's now my supervisor's wife. May not have a job soon. 

Edit 1: As I'm reading through my story I see I could of filled in more details to make things more clear so apologies(my first TIFU post) Getting ready for work so I'll try and update seeing how this blew up overnight.

Edit 2: He's been pulled away on a side project today so not sure what time I'll get to see him. But I appreciate all the feedback and tips. I'm beginning to agree with most people saying I probably got brought up in their convo and got lead into to that topic. But I'll try and respond to as many comments as I can. Will update when something happens. 

Edit 3: So found out he's out on lunch break until around 1230.  We'll be working together when he gets back. Going through comments I agree saying losing my job was a bit overreacting. I'm now expecting more of an awkward tension between us. Not sure how I would feel if this were the other way around. 15 years is long enough to move past most things. 

Edit 4: So it didn't take long before he came up to me and started chatting. Right off the bat starts with ""so I told my wife about what you said, and she wanted me to tell you that you're a little bitch!"" And immediately burst into laughter. Welp, not what I was expecting but I went with it and laughed with him. He goes on telling me how she knew I started working there from her friends(not sure who yet) and told him about us dating before. Told him everything. I again apologize feeling like he might of taken some offense, but quickly realized he didn't give a fuck after he made a comment about how he knew she was a dirty girl before but she's now only dirty for him :/
But we keep talking and come to find out he was trying to find out what I thought of his wife (my ex) while keeping it secret. The opportunity came up in convo yesterday and I fell for it. But he said he didn't expect what I said and though it would be ""hilarious"" to tell his wife about it first before letting me know.  So everything seems cool he said he hopes that doesn't make anything awkward between us and shook my hand. He did however mention that him and his wife wanted to me to hang out and meet the family this weekend. Not sure about that just yet. But either way I wanted to thank you guys. Going through the comments helped make some sense out of this and put my mind at ease a bit. Seen a lot of people calling this in advance but I was so mindfucked I didn't see it. 

Edit 4.5: He's not the same guy I caught her cheating with. Seen a few people ask about that. Neither of them have Reddit, they're both Facebook junkies according to him. And I'm not sure I'm cool calling this guy my eskimo brother. Seems.....odd."

"TIFU by reciprocating with my tinder date


Didn't happen today but quite a while ago. Just heard this Karl Pilkington thing about something similar, and remembered this. 

Anyhow, back then, I was feeling a bit lonely and was going through a bit of a dry spell. I matched with a few bots and generally uninteresting people, some of whom were so dumb, I actually felt like doing anything sexual with them might be considered statutory rape. 

At some point however, I matched up with this incredibly stunning woman who definitely piqued my interest for she was both beautiful and intelligent. She also had a great speaking voice and I was definitely keen on seeing how far this could go. Maybe even relationship material, who knows??

I discovered that she was really into yoga and everything else that comes with a yogi's lifestyle. The only reason that this is worth mentioning is because she thought I looked like I was into yoga as well, but I was not, although at the time I was seriously considering giving it a shot.

We go on back and forth mostly about yoga and her lifestyle which was fascinating to me. She would constantly make remarks about how impressed she was that I never asked her anything sexual and told me all of her horror stories with other dudes. The reality is, I find it really weird and awkward trying to ask girls for sexual favours on the internet. I don't know why, but I'm far smoother with this sort of thing in person. Either way, We set a date to meet and all was well. If anything sexual were to happen, it would be then. 

Two days before we were set to meet, completely out of the blue, she sends me a photo of her lying in her underwear, with a bit of a nip slip situation going on. Then she sends me a video of her lying on her tummy, but you briefly get a glimpse of her beautiful rear end. 

Being the awkward fuck I was, I had no idea how to react to that message and thought that she'd shown me some, so I shall do the same?? 

I do a similar thing in photo form showing her a bit of my rear end mostly as a joke, but secretly hoping she'd enjoy that and send some more or maybe get a ""looking forward to meeting you"" thing. 

Without a word, she blocks me off of everything and that was the end of that. 

**Tl;dr: met someone cool on tinder and planned to meet her. She showed me her ass 2 days prior, I felt compelled to do the same and never heard back from them anymore.**


*Edit: I'm glad this was amusing to many of you. It's cool to see that all the dudes think this is a huge no-no, but the girls totally dig my response. It's quite an interesting twist, I have to say. Just wanted to clarify a few things;*

*I did send her a compliment and she responded to the compliment. The fuck up was really me feeling weird afterwards for not sending something back. Keep in mind I was completely new to this online dating malarkey.* 

*It was definitely meant for me because of the above, but also, she sent me a voice note on WhatsApp saying something about them being a little gift.* 

*I'm also fairly certain she was a real person. We spoke on the phone a few times and sent each other photos of us doing the same stuff (like if I said I was going shopping, she'd send me a cute photo of her unpacking her groceries or whatever).* 

*Also, again; this happened a long time ago. I'm quite happily married at the moment, so I'm not depressed because she ""didn't want my dick.""  Was I confused? Sure, but i moved on fairly quick. You can stop sending me Aggro PMs about being a bitch for still hanging on to this thing. It's just a funny story. Enjoy it, or check out something else.*"
"TIFU by meeting my girlfriends dad


Surprisingly this happened today, yay:)

So a little background, I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 months, never met her parents and today was the big day. As I was going to her house and told her parents would leave when we got there, I brought condoms. Fuck up number one.

Okay so I walk through the door, nervous as hell. The dad comes bounding over with a smile and a hello, now I had my wallet in my hand, with the condom in. Now I don't know of you've seen family guy, but in one episode Brian meets some girls mom and a condom falls out his wallet..this...this is what happened. 

In order to shake his hand I sort of chucked the wallet into my other hand trying to be slick and look like a cool guy, however I missed it completely and it fell to the floor. Already looking like an idiot I go to pick up my wallet, when out of nowhere the condom slides out and just sits on the floor. The dad just looks down, and as slowly as I've ever seen moved his head towards my direction. I look down and notice the durex wrapper on the floor, every muscle in my body seizes, I have no idea what to say, I completely froze in embarrassment and shame. The dad starts yelling at me and orders me to leave, I'm now sat a few minutes away from her house typing this to try and come to terms with what just happened

TL/DR: I went to get my girlfriends dad seal of approval, end up basically showing him I've been fucking his daughter and was planning to in their home

Edit: we are both 17 if this helps with context 

Edit 2: for those who think I'm unintelligent, you would be correct in this instance, just a run of poor sleep and nerves got the best of me today

Edit 3:why are people so hung up on me carrying my wallet,it didn't fit properly in my jeans so was easy at the time

Update: so about 30 minutes went by before my gf returned, turns out the dad thought it'd be funny to shout at me and seem tough, he aint annoyed, just annoyed that my gf didn't do work or something I don't even know. I walked back in and nervously laughed for about 5 minutes trying to convince him it was for a  friend, all whilst trying to hold back tears of embarrassment, fml.

Update 2: so turns out he's actually a pretty cool guy, he apologised for joking around and said it's all cool, we talked about general stuff for about 15 minutes what I wanna do in life etc, then said we can order a pizza when they're gone he's paying. This has been the biggest roller coaster of emotions since Marley and me, he's left and we'll I'll be gone for all of 30 seconds;)

Update 3: So it's the next day,the mom was pissed with the dad for making me feel like a little bitch, was slightly annoyed about the condom simply due to the fact it was their home etc be respectful but all in all everyone's pretty alright now, never putting a condom in my wallet,kids seem a better option "
"TIFU Eating a chicken nugget


This happened a few days ago now and I'm bored enough in ICU to type this up for your amusement. I was driving home the other day when I had the sudden urge for Wendy's nuggets. I wasn't hungry but I had meds that required food, so might as well eat something good. The drink of choice for these particular nugs was a nice strawberry lemonade. 

Flash back to years ago and I'm choking on the most delicious prime rib I've ever had. It was just so good I kept shoveling it in and may have been overly lax on the chewing. Since that choking incident food tends to get stuck at the bottom of my throat. Usually I can just drink something and it'll politely move along. I finished that prime rib.

Present time. Half of the first chicken nugget has been chewed and swallowed as I merge into the interstate. There are no issues, nothing feels abnormal. I happily drink my lemonade and life is good. Wait, it's still in my throat. Oh no, lungs hate lemonade but this shit isn't moving so I start drowning while driving. I put on my turn signal like a civilized fucking person and move over the three lanes to the side and put on hazards. Now covered in my delicious lemonade I make it out of the vehicle and over to the side to choke that shit out of my throat. Success. I finish the meal out of spite and forget my pills.

You wish I was done, we're on to the bonus round. I'm feeling tired, whatever I didn't sleep well the day before. I drink all the caffeine I can find for the remaining two hour drive back. Make it to the office, clock out, make it home. Stairs are a thing and they suck but normally I don't have to crawl up them. Alright something might be wrong. Take a shit that's straight black... that's a new one. I really want to sleep at this point (which likely would have made me dead) but I Google the tar shit because why not. Google basically tells me I'm going to die so a ride to the ER seems in order.

Get wheeled in to wait, no shocker there. Things are moving slowly. Yay I have to shit again. More black gold but wait there's more, I grab the trash can and throw up an additional liter of blood while shitting it. I now have a team of nurses watching some Exorcist level shit but none of them offers to grab a priest. On the bright side that made a room open instantly. Shortly after that I'm wheeled to what I assume is the organ harvesting room and get quickly KOed. Wake up with four staples in my esophagus and an all liquid diet. Still losing blood so I'm volunteered for a second endoscopy that gets me another staple and a cauterized ulcer.

TL;DR Chew your fucking food or you'll drown going 70mph then shit and vomit blood at the same time"
"TIFU by trying to score in Tinder


This just happened a half hour ago. 

I match with a girl yesterday on the old Tinder, and tonight was her last night on the island of Maui. Me, being young and dumb, figured it was worth it to run 7 miles to her resort to score some sugar. 

We pussyfooted around in the messages for a couple of hours, and finally met for a thoroughly unsatisfying encounter that was definitely not worth the effort, and, in dismay, I started my trek back to my resort. 

About 5 or so miles down the dimly lit beach walk, I saw a couple of red blinking lights 50 meters ahead of me which roused my curiosity and my imagination. Unexpectedly, one of the many cats that haunt the resorts ran right in front of me. 

I was so focused on the lights that I flipped out, kicked the cat ahead of me, and the both of us took off running down the beach walk. 

The cat stopped right between the two lights, which turned out to be a couple of bicycles, and began to hiss at me until I strobed it with the flashlight on my phone for a couple seconds and it wandered off. 

I figured the owners of the bikes couldn't be far and started to look around for them. Unfortunately for me, I caught them deer in the headlights style with my light. They were both naked and doing heterosexual stuff just off the path. 

The girl shrieked at a volume that could put firecrackers to shame, and I once again flipped out. As I stumbled backwards, I tripped over one of the bikes and went face first into the wooden beach walk. 

I felt my nose snap and let out a girlish shriek of my own, before I clambered up and started sprinting down the path again. 

When I got back to my room, my buddies helped me set my nose with glee while I regaled them with my story. 

TL;DR 
I caught a couple having some alone time, tripped, broke my nose. "
"TIFU by reading the TIFUs of coconut fuckers..


Im on mobile so sorry about format. First time poster, tldr at the bottom. Sorry if my English is bad.

Be glad, im not fucking or trying to fuck a fruit in this post, infact, I dont think I'll be buying fruit for a week at least. It's bad luck.

Onto the fuckup.

I read the first TIFU yesterday, and let me just tell you im really giggly, anything can make me laugh. So i read the first maggot post, had a good belly laugh, and went to bed. I woke up like two hours ago and decided that I wanted to cook breakfast. 

It was going pretty well, made myself a cheese omelette, put on the kettle for some  tea, and I'd been craving boiled eggs for a while so I took two, put them in the pot and turned on the stove.

Now I decided it'd be a good time to scroll some reddit, so I did that, for about 7 or 8 minutes, at this point I started reading about the 2 more people who had their fair share of bad coconut experience. While I was reading that, the water the eggs were boiling in starts bubbling, and the kettle starts whistling too.

Never try to handle hot boiling water without paying full attention to what you're doing. Especially when you're laughing at other people's fuckups. 

My hand missed the handle of the pot the eggs were in and landed on the hot, hot surface of the kettle. Naturally, I screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK"" on the top of my lungs and jerked my hand back, only to knock over the pot the eggs were in, onto my legs.

I cried. It burned. I was wearing shorts and barefoot.

TLDR: Was reading coconut fleshlight fuck ups and boiling eggs. Was laughing and not paying attention, spilled boiling water onto my legs. Was wearing shorts and barefoot.

"TIFU by flashing my landlord


I have a weird living situation. I live in the upstairs apartment of a home with two middle aged men that live downstairs. The house is away from town, kind of far off from people. So I don't usually expect cars or people passing the house often. 
Because of this I tend to keep blinds open on the windows. These windows are floor to ceiling, big, definitely see through windows. I have my own entrance because they prefer to use the back door. Because of this, very rarely do they see the front lawn, unless they are driving to go somewhere. 
 Anyways, I get home from a run. I have one of those sports bras that unzip in the front. So being as stupid as I am, I am standing in front of the window looking out at the fields across from my house. While doing this I am slowly unzipping my sports bra and my boobs pop out. About 20 seconds later,  I see one of my landlords staring straight at the ground walking as fast as he can across the lawn to the door. I hurried and jumped  to the side out of window view.  

Every time we run into each other is so awkward now. I know he's seen my boobs. He knows he's seen my boobs. But we don't talk about it. Just a hello and a wave when we pass each other outside. Just thinking about it gives me anxiety. I bought black out curtains the next day. 


TL;DR I took my bra off in front of my window and watched my landlord run for the hills when he noticed. Now my living situation is so awkward. "
"TIFU by being tempted by the magnitude of coconut fucking posts. NSFW


Mom, I'm sorry.

After the first 2 posts of cocoNUTing I was getting a little interested, but decided against giving in to the combination of being incredibly horny and curious  at the same time. 


Then the next one came.

I heard my mom's voice in my mind, ""If all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too?""  But the devil on my other shoulder told me that as long as i didnt let it fill with maggots, or drill it to small, or slice my dick on the pullout i would be fine. Boy was I wrong.

I grabbed a spare coconut from a decorative fruit bowl, and begun drilling with a knife and a twisting motion. I lubed up and begun the time old ritual of coconut fornication. 

Now, this whole process was quite loud and i was negligent to the fact that my family was still home, but by the time I realized this it was too late. 

WHOOOSH 

The door swung open with such speed that I couldn't react. There was no warning and because of the little bitch I am freaked the fuck out and ripped it off my manhood faster than a bullet.

""What The FUCK"" My mom said while seeing me throw a coconut off my bleeding dick. Before I could say anything the shut the door and hasn't said a word to me since. This just happened, Wish me luck guys.

TL;DR
Somehow convinced myself that following in the footsteps of my coconut fucking brethren was a good idea and i'm now probably going up for adoption soon.


Edit: Obligatory Obligatory Holy shit this Blew up! I am now known as a coconut fucker by about 47 thousand people. Maybe i could use that as leverage to get adopted faster....."

"TIFU by not admitting I farted


I work at a hospital. 

I was at the Operating Room front desk where they coordinate the activity, in front of the board where all of the surgeries were listed.

And I had to poop. Bad. But the one bathroom was full and had a line. I thought if I let out a little gas the urge would become more bearable.

The problem was I had been eating a lot of boiled eggs. 

I thought, I'll let one slip. A silent but violent, and not a small one, but creaking for several long dreadful seconds. I struggled mightily to keep it as quiet as possible and with the chatter and noise nobody heard. I felt immediately so much better and thought nobody would notice.

Then, the charge nurse sniffs and says, do you smell that?

Another supervisor pops open the door of the adjacent operating room, asking if they were having any issues with the bowel surgery they were performing. Maybe they cut into the colon or something. Nope, no problems there.

Soon, up and down the hall everyone is complaining about the foul stink. ""Like rotten eggs!"" One staffer said he was getting nauseated and asked to take a break.

The more consternation I created, the more embarrassed I was to own up to it. I slunk away. Later I learned a surgery start was delayed 15 minutes while maintenance rushed up to check for a gas leak. Fortunately it was not an emergency surgery.

TL;DR too embarrassed to own up to a fart, caused a delay in a surgery, nearly killed our OR staff with chemical gas warfare grade fart too."
