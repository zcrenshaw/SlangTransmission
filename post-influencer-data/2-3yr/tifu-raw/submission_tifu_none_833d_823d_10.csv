"TIFU by picking the lock to my dad who hates me's top secret file cabinet, finding crazy secrets, and then accidentally popping the lock out. In 5 hours he finds out, I get kicked and out and will have to drop out of college. Any knowledge of locks appreciated.

"TIFU by accidentally dosing myself with LSD at work.


Throwaway.  Well it was around noon when I ate my pasta.  Shortly after that I found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.

TL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office."
"TIFU by ejaculating in my bed


Throwaway obviously. This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.

So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.



I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. 



So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.

TL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation"
"TIFU I accidentally proposed to my girlfriend waking up from appendix surgery


Not really a fuck up, more just an unexpected suprise. So on Friday I woke up at 7:30 a.m. with abdominal pain. My girlfriend of 7 years told me to stop moving around so much and went to work. I was rolling around for about 3 hours until I realized that my pain was getting more localized in my right lower quadrant area. Since I work in the medical field I knew right away it was going to be an expensive day. So I grabbed my phone charger and went to the hospital. Was immediately checked into the emergency room, got a CT scan and was told by the doctor that I needed my appendix out that day. So I was admitted into the hospital, my parents and girlfriend came. They were by my side as I went into the operating room. When I came out of surgery and was in pacu, both my girlfriend and my parents were there waiting for me. Working in the medical field I knew that people my age (30 years old) say some crazy things from anesthesia but I didn't realize how crazy it was going to affect my life. When I started coming to, the drugs/anesthesia affected my judgment and i made a life-altering decision. I looked at my girlfriend, pointed to her instead, ""I WANT TO MARRY YOU!"" right in front of both of my parents. She was in shock, so she turned to my parents and asked him if I was being serious or if it was just the drugs talking. They reassured her that I was serious because I had ""mentioned"" marriage to them in the past. So she said, ""of course I will"" and my parents said,"" welcome to the family"", then they all hugged. So yesterday I purchased her an engagement ring and the wedding planning has begun. So I guess the moral of the story is, sometimes it takes having less guts to have guts to do something?

Tl;dr got appendix out, proposed on drugs, I'm engaged

Edit: Holy shit, front page? Really? Haha. A little background story, i was joking around in the comments. She waited until I was 100 percent first to make sure I really wanted to do it. I have discussed with my parents multiple times that I wanted to marry her also. My parents aren't grandbaby crazy, we don't want kids. I love my girlfriend and coming out of surgery made me realize how fragile and short life really is. No more fooling around. Thanks for the gold and front page!"
"TIFU by forgetting 5+ years of college education in a moment of weakness


Here we go, friends. This FU did in fact happen today. I am currently curled up on my bathroom floor, spooning my toilet as if it were my highschool sweetheart about to leave for war, because of a moment of idiocy that occurred about 5 hours ago.

For some necessary backstory, I am a recent college graduate with a degree in nursing. I had a little too much fun in college, so it took me 5 and a half years to graduate. Being that it took me almost 2 years longer than it should have to obtain my degree, I am currently drowning in student debt. Also, I recently discovered that due to a clerical error, the dental insurance I thought I had under my parent's health insurance was cancelled last year. So when my dentist told me a few months back that my wisdom teeth were growing in at delightfully awkward angles and would need to be removed, I scoffed a pathetic little scoff and decided to hold off until next year, when I could get dental insurance through my work. 

Flash forward to 3 days ago. My right wisdom tooth begins to hurt. Like, REALLY hurt. Like, the worst hurt that I've ever felt in my 25 years of life. My mouth begins to swell. It swells so much that I begin to have trouble opening my jaw. My jaw becomes so tight that I can barely fit a spoon in to my mouth. I am resolved to essentially sipping soup and broth all day, at which point I call my dentist. She says that it sounds like an infection that resulted in lock jaw. I cave in and schedule a wisdom tooth extraction, and am prescribed 10 days worth of antibiotics, as well as some medication for the pain.

As any freshman nursing student can confirm, a common side effect of both antibiotics and pain relievers is nausea/vomiting. To avoid this, it's recommended that you take these medicines with food. I am so desperate for relief when I go to get my medicines that I completely overlook this information that I had engraved into my eager student brain 5 years before. Y'all see where this is going? 

I pick up my medicines and enthusiastically take them all at once, on an essentially empty stomach. What resulted was a violent vomiting episode that hasn't been seen since the Jello Shot Nightmare of Freshman Year. I hope you never EVER have to experience the pain of vomiting while simultaneously having lock jaw. It was indescribable. The icing on the cake, though, was having to call my super-nurse manager and explain that I would not make it in to work today as I was experiencing a completely avoidable side effect of my medicines, and am thus probably unfit to be a nurse.

TL;DR forgot how to be a nurse when I got lock jaw from a wisdom tooth infection, may never leave my bathroom floor again. SOS.

Edit: I just want to thank you all for the overwhelmingly kind/supportive comments, and for all of the advice on how to alleviate the pain. You all have really brightened up an incredibly lousy day. I'd smile larger but, you know, the lock jaw and all... ;)"
"TIFU by dumping a whole pitcher of water over my customers head.


At the restaurant I used to work at there was an extra upstairs room for special parties and the like. It had a spiral staircase and a large round table sat directly below the staircase. One day a big party came in and wanted to sit upstairs. Everything went great, although it was annoying taking large trays of food up a spiral staircase. Once the party left upstairs i began to clean up the room. I was taking dirty dishes down in tubs and glasses in racks. Finally, there were just a few full pitchers of water. My tray was wet and I knew the pitchers might slide around on it but I put them all on there anyway so I didn't have to keep coming back up and down. I was at the top of the staircase and the pitchers started to slide around. One slides straight off of the tray and dumps its entire contents of icy cold water on an elderly woman's head at the table below the staircase. I think the pitcher even bonked her on the head for good measure. She said my look of horror alone was apology enough.  All of my coworkers were ruthless about it, saying things like I tried to make a waterfall installation and what not. TL;DR- I accidentally soaked an old lady with an entire pitcher of cold water at work. "
"TIFU by falsely reporting that my car was stolen


My wife and I drove separately to church on Sunday but left together in my car, intending to pick up hers later in the day. Fast forward to tonight (Wednesday) and we still had not made it back to pick up the second car.

So finally tonight I call an Uber when the kids are asleep and sure enough the car is not in the parking lot. I Uber back home and call the local police department, they had no record of it being towed so I report the vehicle as stolen. They send two officers to my house to get my statement, I'm stressing about insurance coverage and feeling shitty for not just getting it sooner.

It's 11:30 and I'm getting into bed, and I make some comment to my wife about how they had the parking lot locked up... her: ""I parked on the street, not in the lot"".

So I fucked up by not confirming where the car had been parked or walking the 50 steps to check the street before getting the police involved. Sorry for wasting your time officer Ortiz!

So I just took an Uber back to the church and the car is right where she left it. I called the police department again to tell them my mistake and they made it very clear that I should not get in the car because it is still in their system as stolen. I'm currently sitting outside at 1am waiting for a call from the officer to give me the go ahead to drive home.

TL;DR: didn't know where my wife parked the car, reported it as stolen."
"TIFU By telling my son ""Do as I say, not as I do""


So I wrote and posted this here yesterday without proof reading and it was terribly written. I attempted to edit it multiple times to make it more coherent but I decided to try one more time with a slightly better written shortened version. Forgive me if you already read this.

So the obligatory this was not today, it happened Friday.

I'll start by saying I have little experience working on cars but knew the brakes that were previously squeaking and are now grinding was not good.

Knowing this would damage the car over time and not wanting it to get worse I decided to take my 16 year old son, buy some brake pads and learn how to change them together.

I'm in IT, and like anyone in the tech industry, I am an expert at Google/YouTube. So we bought the pads and got some advice from our auto parts store, then headed home and pull up 3 videos on how to change brake pads.

We were both very confident we could do this and headed outside to my driveway, my not perfect flat slightly inclined driveway. Knowing this was dangerous and not wanting to drive 30 minutes to my dad's house where I would have access to all the proper equipment, I decide to pull the car sideways in my driveway. I tell my son don't ever do this, you should always use jack stands and make sure the car is secure before working on it. The jack we are using from the car is for changing a tire on the side of the road in the event of an emergency not for use while working on your car. Then arrogantly proceeded to do exactly the opposite because ""I'll just be careful""

So while tightening the last bolt on the brake caliper the car slowly moves and the jack falls over  and the rotor falls on my forearm, I watch as my arm opens up like the Grand Canyon vertically from what I thought was wrist to elbow at the time and I'm instantly terrified. I look over at my son and my fear vanished as I felt tremendous guilt, the look on his face was as if he just watched me die as he screamed ""OMG DAD!"" I somehow pushed the car with my left arm and pulled my injured right arm free and immediately wrapped it in my shirt and said ""it's bad but I'll be fine son, get me a towel fast and tell your mom"" he runs in and I walk in the house and begin directing traffic...

The first towel, a full size bath towel was saturated in blood quickly and I began applying really firm pressure on my upper forearm where I thought would be the most likely area to have a severed vein. I have my son wrap the second towel around my arm and pull hard, had my wife call my dad because my only vehicle is not driveable. He is coming but 20-30 min away and I now feel my shirt getting soaked in blood where I have my wrist pressed against my body. (Turns out the injury was lower and I had most of the pressure in the wrong place). I eventually had my son wrap a belt tight on my bicep, but concerned about blood loss I decide not to wait for my dad and call 911.

With the makeshift tourniquet held tight by my son, I sit back and try to control my breathing until the paramedics arrive. About 5 minutes later (15-20 minutes since the initial injury) the paramedics arrive and said, ""we are going to have to get a look at this so we can see what we are dealing with, you can look away"". I watch as they unravel the towels  and I see the wound, its bad but not as long as I thought, it was mostly just above my wrist and about 8-10 inches long. The paramedic immediately says, ""Great job stopping the bleeding man, but this will need repaired from the inside out with surgery."" 

Once I'm in the hospital and the doctor opens my bandage from the paramedics, she looks at me and says I have no idea how but I don't see any structural damage and think we can just clean this and sew it up. And she was right, after a couple hours of cleaning it and xrays etc, I got 14 stitches and went home. I felt like a bit of a drama queen at that point but there was no way for me to know the extent of the injury.

I am positive my son will never make the mistake I made and work on a car in unsafe conditions, so that's good.

[My Father's Day gift ](https://imgur.com/gallery/jsZqs)

TL;DR tried to change break pads with a roadside bottle jack as the only thing lifting my car while on a slanted driveway, almost lost my arm when it fell and nearly crushed/amputated just above the wrist. 

Edit: I added a link to my Father's Day gift instead of linking it to my replies. I truly appreciate the well wishes and advice."
"TIFU by accidentally tricking two teachers into thinking I was bleeding from both eyes and nostrils, causing one to faint


Obligatory this happened roughly 14 or so years ago. Me and my friends were quite the pranksters in middle school, nothing too serious. The most we ever got in trouble for was using a chain to lock everyones bikes together, there was a snitch amongst us. 

One day in cooking class we find a bottle of red food dye and get the bright idea to go around the school yard at lunch and he would run at me yelling ""You stole her from me!"" And graze past my cheek on the opposite side of our spectators and I would turn my head and apply the dye slightly in my nose and let it drip. Holy shit did this get the most genuine concerned looks. People rushing over, girls crying, people pushing my friend back, and then the reveal. And then the laughs, the confusion and sometimes anger.... we did this one more time and decided to do it one more time since my face started to look sunburnt. We find a good sized group of people, we decide to go out with a bang and set up, but were unaware of the two teachers walking behind past the crowd. As my friend shouts ""You stole her from me!"" Everyone turns, I step up my game and apply the dye to my eyes and before I can even look up this poor, poor lady is screaming her head off, crying and promptly fainting. Addrenaline kicked into overdrive and I froze in place, not saying a word, shaking uncontrollably though. Freaking everyone out even more as my friend tries as hard as he can to explain what is happening.

The paramedics show up and my vitals get taken followed by some mental sanity questions. I ask about the teacher and all they could tell me was that she was alright. The teacher was on leave for 3 or 4 days and seemed perfectly normal. I had to write an apology letter and read it out loud in front of herself, my parents, the principal and the counselor.

TLDR: Used red food dye to trick a teacher into thinking I was bleeding out my eyes making her faint, causing the paramedics to be called."
"TIFU by being buried alive


This happened close to an hour ago.

First time traveling to Japan, and have been here for three weeks. I am staying in a lovely Ryokan for the first time. Very nice place. A five minute walk from this Ryokan there is a a very famous Beppu onsen called Takegawara, which is both a natural spring bath AND a sand bath. I travel there in hopes of enjoying said sand bath.

 What's a sand bath you, ask?

Well, apparently I didn't really read up on it to well.

I get to it and it's this super beautiful onsen with very lovely hosts, and I see a pit of sand directly after the women's showers. I put on the provided robe, cover up and think I'm gonna go play in warm sand and maybe bury my feet. I was the only one there; score! 

Then I see two women with shovels.

They begin digging about a six inch, body-long grave just the right fit for little ole me. Okay, no biggie? I get to sit in a hole, cool.

I sit and it's great, very warm... And then they ask my to lay down. Lol, alright ladies calm down now...

I hear a very familiar sound of the scraping of sand on the shovel as they begin to dig and cover me with dozens of scopes of wet, heavy, burning sand. OKAY, this is different than what I thought!

My feet first, okay it's heavy and hot but it's just my feet so I can do this. 

My legs up to my groin. Getting significantly hotter. I'm having a hard time adjusting.

Up to right below my now heaving-with-panic bosom. My body feels like I'm being crushed my the centrifugal force in those theme park spinning machines. 

My arms. I can't move. Panic is definitely happening. Am I sweating because the sand is cooking my body, or because I'm nervous? Hahaha...

That has to be it right? 

They cover my chest, my neck and around my head. 

I am completely entombed.

This took these women all of ten seconds, and they place their shovels down to Look at me and smile. In a broken, accent heavy attempt at English one says ""15 minute start now, okay?""

Nope. I have never noped this hard in my life. My sweat pores screamed and together in unison they all went 'Nope'. I'm pretty sure if I could have moved my hands would have signed 'Nope'. So what did I do next?

I laid there. Terrified. Imprisoned. Smiling at these wonderfully kind Asian women who just want to make me comfortable. That kind of smile you give someone after you blow ass in the bathroom and they hear, and now you have to wash your hands next to them. That smile. 

I tried to distract myself, I really did. Without being able to move my head much the ceiling and the foot high pile of sand around my face and boobs didn't seem very interesting. I'm sweating, hard. I wiggled my hands for clearance but all that managed to do was make a cave of heat and moisture for my hands to soak in.

Time moved at a sludge-like pace. I can feel my heartbeat in my ears, and it's getting louder and faster... I begin to have a panic attack.

For those of you who have experienced these in your life you understand the moment as follows, for the rest I hope you never have to. 

My body would have left that building had a half ton of sand not been weighing me down. I writhed, kicked, and probably mastered a form of taijutsu with my attempt to escape my sandy sarcophagus. The women both scramble to me, one holds my shoulders and the other rubs my back . I have no idea what they are saying. My vision starts to go out. 

I have no recollection of how I ended up from my grainy prison to under a freezing shower, but there I was with a puke bucket between my legs with two Asian women looking at me with pity and concern. I didn't actually get sick, but apparently they've seen this same scene before.

I get washed up and free of sand. They give me a bottle of water, new customers walk in and we part ways. Now I'm in my hotel room and I'm pretty sure I'm on some 'do not serve' list now 

Tl;dr: Found out you can get buried alive in Beppu, Japan. I didn't do well with it."
"TIFU, by hitting my eye with air.


*This happened last Wednesday, 6/14/17

**My Current Eye Situation**

My left eye is a lazy eye and is much worse than my right. I have to have fairly powerful contacts, therefore I had rely on my right eye a lot. My vision is fine when both contacts are in. 



**The *screw* Up**

Ahh, It's early Wednesday morning, and my young 14 year old self has planned on making some extra cash thanks to a Summer job. I was going to be doing metal roofing on a fairly steep house with my grandfather. I'm accustomed to this job and it's not something I'm scared of, however I understand the dangers and take all precautions when working. With such a dangerous job, you would think I FU would be *on* the roof, right? Wrong. After hours of sweat and hard work, the job was over. Time to pack up! I start with picking up the old shingles that we scraped off to replace with shiny metal panels, then cleaned up whatever else trash was thrown around. Then, it was time to pack up the air compressor. I began to unhook the air hose from the compressor. I have done this many times, so I thought nothing of it. I began to pull the mechanism used to release it, however it was harder than usual (Most likely because it was under more pressure than I assumed). *Here is where all my bad Decisions come in and turn into a FU*. I pull, and pull, but for some reason it won't come off. So I decide to put my foot on it and push, as well as use both hands and pull the hose, therefore I had no way of stopping the hose once it came off and flailed everywhere. However, I wasn't really concerned about it, because what could a little air under pressure do?  ^POP. Yay! It came off. I god. It just hit my right eye. 

The hose didn't hit my eye, but the air did. It hurt, but it wasn't to bad. Kinda like when you get punched under the eye; it hurts, but it's not unbearable. However, when I opened my eye, there was a thick film or blur over my right eye. Remember, my left eye ain't worth shit without my right eye, so I was nearly blind. I tried to read my phone, but couldn't even see the huge ass clock on my home screen. I was panicking. My grandfather assured me it would be fine, and to just put some ice on it. I nodded, and held back my tears. we finished packing up, and got in the truck. I could tell the film had become much larger and thicker now. I asked my grandfather to look at my eye. When he decided to go to the eye doctor, I knew it must have looked bad, because he is know for not going to the doctor, like, ever. *He has even cut out a in-grown toenail with a pocket knife...* We get there, and the doctor tells me that I have blood under my [iris](http://www.okcoptometrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/dv246007.jpg) (the colored part of your eye). He said *any* activity could result in the eye to bleed worse, and therefore potentially cause a blood clot *in my eye* and cause me to go blind. Then, I would be left with my crappy left eye, that's basically useless by itself. 

The doctor even told me stress and being anxious is risky, as if I can be anything other than stressed out after he tells me I might go blind at **14 years old.** He tells me to do absolutely nothing for 3 days, and only open my eyes for two eye drops he prescribed me. And I did just that. For 72 hours straight, I laid motionless in my bed with a rag over my eyes. This gave my mind time to run wild and drive me absolutely insane while I thought about how horrible my life is going to be if I don't get lucky. I can't express how horrible these few days where, but I can say that I would have rather voluntarily broke my arm. Anyway, fast forward to my next doctor's appointment, and he said that I was very lucky and might be able to lay with my eyes open a few days. However, I can't do any eye tracking, so no TV, Games, or Books. 

What the heck is the point then? I wasn't even supposed to look left and right. Whatever, a few more days of nothingness, I guess. So once that's over, I come back to hear my verdict. Great recovery, he says! He tells me I can slowly start using my eyes more, for things like eating and showering. I feel great and relieved. *Phew, I survived...* He told me to immediately contact him if I have any pain, and whaddaya know... PAIN. I have a bad pain in my right eye the next day. So we call them and I now have a sty. I have a sty *and* a delicate wound in my right eye that may bleed at any moment. Cool. Well, today I woke up and my eye is swollen shut. That isn't even an exaggeration. Only time will tell how the rest of the story goes...

**UPDATE:** Thank you all that have worried for me and shared your similar stories. Some of you even PM'd me to check up on me, and that means a lot. Really guys, thanks. So everything seems to be clearing up. My vision is back to normal, and my sty has gone away. The swelling has gone completely down. I am 99% sure I'm fine, but we are still going to on Friday to see what the doctor says. I actually noticed a sty is trying to form in my left eye now, but I'm already treating it before it gets bad. Again, thank you all for checking on me! Also, added some spacing per you guy's request. It probably isn't in the right spots, as I didn't write it with paragraphs in mind. Oh well.



**EDIT:** It seemed to piss some people off that I explained what an air compressor was, so I removed that portion. Sorry I guess. Also, thank you very much for the anonymous user who gave me gold! It is much appreciated. Honestly didn't expect this to be such a hit.


**TL:DR** : I hit myself in they with air that was under pressure, I had bleeding under my iris and risked being blind. Then a few days later got a sty in the same eye and it's swollen shut."
