"TIFU by pooping on my police academy hat.


Been in the academy 3 months, we have to wear baseball caps that say ""POLICE ACADEMY"" on them whenever we are outside. When we go inside we tuck the caps into the back of our pants to hold them. I ate mango habanero wings at BDubs last night and had explosive diarrhea this morning so I decided to poop before going into class. Went to the stall, pulled my pants down and spewed lava for 20 minutes. When I was done I stood up, turned around to flush and noticed something under all the shit. Then noticed the words ""POL"", was confused for a good 30 seconds before it hit me. Drill instructor yelled at me for being outside without a cover, asked me why, and instead of the usual ""no excuse sir"", I told him. He laughed for 5 minutes, first time I've ever seen him smile. He gave me a new cover and told all the other instructors who now call me ""shit head"". 

TLDR: dropped hat in toilet without noticing, explosive diarrhea, drill instructors call me shit head now. "

"TIFU by releasing a bunch of eels in the kitchen.


This happened when I was a kid but the fuck-up came back to haunt me not too long ago. 

When I was young I was extremely infatuated with animals. I was forever bringing home stray cats and injured birds. My dad, a rough trawler fisherman all his life, couldn't understand his daughters obsession with  animals. He believes animals are for food, not cuddling. 

And this is how what is now known in our family as the 'Eel Incident' came to be. 

One day my dad brought home a bucket full of eels he caught from our local lake together with one of our neighbours. Smoked eel is a local delicacy where I'm from, so that what my dad and his mate planned to do with their catch. They were pretty chuffed with themselves, cracked a few celebratory beers outside whilst cranking up the smoker. 

Whilst my dad and his friend were getting drunk outside I decided to have a peak at their catch in the kitchen. I peeled the lid off the bucket and was surprised to discover the 30+ eels in the bucket were still alive, just wriggling and sliding in a giant slime ball. 

My bleeding heart immediately kicked in. Those poor eels! They don't even have water! How are they supposed to breathe?! 
So I sprung in action and threw a pan full of water in the bucket. The eels liked it, they wiggled more. Another pan. More movement. 
I was delighted...  Until one of the bigger eels broke loose from the ball and managed to slide over the edge of the bucket. 

Drats. I hadn't anticipated that. And I realised I was in lots of trouble if my dad found out I tampered with his catch. So I tried to grab the eel and put it back with his slimy friends. Great plan except that holding a slippery eel is a lot like, well... holding a slippery eel. 

After many frantic attempts I finally got a good hold of the creature and quickly tried to put it back in the bucket.  But a fatal combination of my panic, clumsiness and complete lack of coordination (which I still suffer from to this day) I accidentally kick over the bucket. 

Eels EVERYWHERE. 

At this moment my dad hears the commotion and opens up the door to find me frozen in the middle of a quickly spreading carpet of eels, whilst still desperately clutching one individual. 

He quickly responds and frantically starts to catch the eels before they spread further. But, again, eels are mighty slippery and it didn't help that I added two panloads of water to the slimy mess that is now our kitchen floor. Right behind my dad is our neighbour who was a bit tipsy after the celebration beers. He immediately comes to my dads assistance but forgets to close the door behind him, allowing his feisty little Jack Russell terrier to come in. The dog snaps into full possessed kill mode, catching and shaking the eels at a demonic speed. Slime and fishguts splash up the kitchen walls. The neighbour starts yelling at the dog, I start wailing, my mum comes running in and starts screaming when she sees the mayhem that is her kitchen. In all this confusion my dad looses his balance on the slimy floor, slips over, crushes 3 eels and breaks a finger. 

I can't remember how it all ended because I was send off to my room and had to stay there for 2 weeks. 
I do remember the kitchen stinking like fishguts for months after, no matter how much my mum scrubbed it. And me hearing about it every time she did. 

The Eel Incident happened about 20 years ago. 5 years ago my parents sold their house and the new owners did some renovations to the kitchen. Behind one of the cupboards they discovered what they thought were the remains of a snake (which is pretty unlikely since my parents live in Holland). When my dad came over to inspect he found that it was in fact the mummified remains of a getaway eel. 

TL;DR: Me trying to help a bucketload of eels causes great pain and suffering for everyone involved. Except the dog. The dog had a fat time. 

EDIT: first gold! Thanks stranger! I'd give you a eel bouquet if I could. "
"TIFU by being an idiot


Happened literally 5 minutes ago. 

My sister and I were arguing about if she needed a LifeProof case (expensive) for an iPhone she's going to buy. I took out my Moto G2 and, saying ""iPhones are weak, look at this"", dropped it from waist-height facedown onto our hardwood floors. I pick it up, them turn it over to the screen. 

Cracks. Spreading out diagonally from the front-facing camera, then bouncing around the sides.

"TIFU by melting my mother's wedding gift and getting my house infested with tarantulas.


This happened about two years ago in the summer when I was home from college. 

So background story, I am infamous among my friends for being horrible at cooking because I get really impatient when it comes to food. I hate waiting for water to boil or waiting for the oven to preheat and I'm bad at following directions. I have flooded microwaves trying to make microwave mac n cheese, burnt soups, and unforgettably melted my mom's $400 wedding gift pot. 

My mom loves to cook and often makes these delicious broths that she boils for hours on staying up during the night which she boils through the morning and turns the stove off in the afternoon. 

On this particular morning, she made it on a weekday and therefore had to go to work in the morning and put me in charge of turning the stove off in the afternoon. I was like okay mom no big deal I can't fuck this up, wrong. After standing in the kitchen for a solid 2 minutes I get bored of waiting and take a nap setting the alarm for noon, fuck up number one. 

When I wake up, I hear fire alarms going off and look at my phone feeling betrayed because my alarm never went off only to realize I had set the alarm for 12 AM instead of PM. I run downstairs to the kitchen to find it filled with smoke. I immediately turn off the stove and run to open all the windows and doors. I go back to the stove and lift the pot and lo and behold the bottom of the pot melted off from the rest of the pot, bubbling and hardening into molten metal. 

I quickly bring the pot outside and try to scrape off the molten metal off of my glass stove with a spatula, fuck up number two. As I frantically scrape up a chunck of the hardening goo I hear my stove crack. I think ""shit, I just melted a pot and cracked my stove all in one day this cannot get any worse"", wrong. 

Because I had opened all the doors and windows a freaking tarantula, A TARANTULA??!! (By the way this is in Georgia so tarantulas are not common here and I had never come across one until this day) crawled in through the door and made its way into the kitchen. Now this was when that viral video of the guy swatting a tarantula with a broom resulted in it exploding into million baby tarantulas. I had the maybe I shouldn't smack the tarantula thought in the back of my head but when that mother fucker moved I screamed and smacked it with a fly swatter, fuck up number three. 

All hell breaks loose and it explodes into millions of baby tarantulas. I was mortified and tried to spray ant poison at it but by the time I found the spray can many of the baby tarantulas had made it way to different parts of my house. 

I now had to call my mother telling her I almost set the house on fire, wasted her time and efforts going into the broth, melted her wedding gift pot, cracked the stove, and infested the house with tarantulas. My mom came home immediately and after getting an earful of anger and confusion she told me to make myself useful and move the bed in the third floor guest room to my room on the second floor. I rush over in shame and begin to move the box for the bed down the stairs until I see a baby tarantula crawling on the wall and drop the corner of the bed box on my foot. I wailed in pain and just broke down and cried like a bitch. 

My mom rushes over and starts laughing at how ridiculous I am and said ""poor sharonoelee nothing ever goes right does it"" and deems I had enough and makes me sit on my bed and keep my hands to myself so I don't cause any more accidents. 

It was a horrible day and I had a persisting limp for a good 2 weeks, but I can laugh about it now. 

TL;DR: forgot to turn off stove, almost burn down my house, melted my mom's wedding gift pot, cracked the glass stove by scraping the melted pot off with a spatula, tarantula entered in through opened door, when I smacked it, it exploded into millions of baby tarantulas infesting my house, fun stuff.


Edit: The wolf spider looks almost even more terrifying than the tarantula/spider demon I encountered in my house. The mother and the babies were all black, hairy, and the mother was bigger than my hand. Thankfully, hopefully, none of the baby tarantulas grew up to be that size *shudder* but I do not need more pictures of spiders in my life, please do not send me any more pictures of spiders please and thank you.

Edit #2: Some people are confused as to why my mom sent me to move the bed. I came home from college for the summer so my bed was in my apartment in another town so I had to move the extra bed from the guest room to my room, sorry for the confusion.

Edit #3: To those saying the stove was long gone before I scraped it with the spatula, there is a crater in my stove because the stove actually melted too and the crack grows every year. We still use the stove, three out of the four heating spots still work! I think I managed to do about $3,000 in damage in one day (sorry mom and dad, I love you).

Edit 3.5: I will relink my photos of the incident into the edit tomorrow, afternoon, whenever I wake up... thank you for all your kindness and not kindness they all made me laugh throughout the day!

Edit 4: [pictures from that day] (http://imgur.com/a/kVno8) I don't have pictures of the tarantula/spider demons because it was such a chaotic day and the last thing I would have wanted was to have pictures of them on my phone. I go home in about 2 weeks so I'll post pictures of the crater in my stove which I named Timmy."

"TIFU by going for a booty calls at the tender age of 14


This happened about 6 years ago and I feel like everyone should know
Anyways, I started dating this girl when I was 13. It was the typical lovey dovey early teenage relationship and it actually lasted quite awhile. Around 8 months we decided to start having sex. In order to do this, I had to wait till 1AM, take my parents car keys from their room, bust out of the guest room window, roll the car out in neutral down the driveway, and then make a 40 minute trip to her house. Then I'd do the sex, and be back home just in time to beat my parent's alarms. Clarification, this was the only way we could find to do it since both of our parents were hardcore Christians and were never allowed to hang out alone.
Anyways, on sneak out attempt number 12 I remember thinking to myself, ""Wow this is getting easy"". Fuck up #1. I get to my girlfriends house, have more of the sex, and then leave. Get in my car and the ride starts getting bumpy. I pull over and see that I have a flat tire. Tried changing the tire, but my tender young body couldn't loosen the lug nuts . I make the executive decision to just try to ride it out. I lived 20 miles away. Fuck up #2. I get on the highway and turn on the emergency lights and slowly make my way home. Halfway through the ride I see sparks flying by my right tire. I look over and see that there is no rubber on the tire and I'm riding on bare rim. I take the nearest exit and as soon as I do, my car dies out. Apparently cables run from the steering wheel to the engine over the right tire and the shards of rubber from my tire ripped through and cut the cables clean. Couldn't turn on the car and all power was gone. Great. Check my watch, it was 3AM. Even better, my phone was dead (left it on Pandora all night). So I make my way down the road and try to walk to a gas station. I look to my right and see a church and the lights were on and someones inside. I think, ""Jesus can definitely save me in this situation."" WRONG. Cleaners think Im a junkie trying to loot the place. Oh well. Keep walking down and Im trying to wave down some cars to give me a ride. Finally see a car and I wave it down. It just happened to be a police officer. Fuck up #3 He turns around and then questions why a scrawny 15 year old is walking on backroads at 3 in the morning looking like a grease monkey. I tell him the story, and he agrees to help. He asks for my license and realizes that I barely have a learners permit. He feels so bad for me at this point that he overlooks it. I get into the back of his patrol car and start freaking out because Im thinking Im going to jail. He helps me change the tire, and then lets me borrow his phone to call my parents. At this point I'm in bawling trying to explain to my dad what I did and where I was. Pretty sure the officer is laughing the entire time. I then wait 2 hours for my parents to arrive (they weren't going to miss out of their sleep) so I just sat there thinking about the impending doom. To add insult to injury, I locked my self out of my car so I sat on the side of the street waiting. After my parents picked me up, I didn't see the light of day for 4 months. Im close to turning 21 and I think Im still technically grounded. My parents have gotten over it, but Im still exclusively known as the ""Car Thief"" in my family.
TL;DR Drove 40 minutes for sex when I was 15 and then caused thousands of dollars in damage to 
my parents car and pride

EDIT: For those of you who think it's made up, I can understand. To be fair my timeline is off, but I relatively accurate. I tried my best to guesstimate the times. If you don't believe it oh well!"

"TIFU by spraying Diet Pepsi all over strangers at the airport at 6am.


I need to wake up gradually with plenty of coffee if I’m going to have a good day.  One day, in a strange city, I overslept and had to make the airport IMMEDIATELY.  Through superpowers that I didn’t even know I had, I managed to pack, get the rental to the right place after fueling it, grab a shuttle to the airport, get through security and made it to the gate with ten or so minutes to spare.  Although I had squeezed in a shower, I hadn’t had any food or, more importantly, caffeine, since the day before. 

With my few leftover minutes I went scavaging for food and although I was looking for a coffee and hopefully a pastry or something, but at 6am not everything was open and all I could get was a Diet Pepsi and a hot dog.   I find that Diet Pepsi has just a little too much fizz for my liking and I have this habit of taking a slug and then putting the cap back on, giving it a good shake to fill the space I made with my drink with fizz and then slowly bleed the fizz off by cracking the cap.  This reduces the fizz to the perfect amount for me.  So I was in a strange airport at 6am after an hour and a half of frantic scurrying without caffeine, completely discombobulated, and I take the slug, give the bottle a good shake, and then completely uncap the bottle, spraying Diet Pepsi in about a ten foot radius.

Even though the airport was only half open, the gate was completely packed.  Everyone was in fresh, clean clothes on their way to meetings far away.  I completely drenched at least 8 people, getting Diet Pepsi all over the front of them, soaking their faces and hair.

And all I could say was sorry.

EDIT: One of the best and most comforting things about Reddit is that no matter how weird you are, no matter how sick and twisted your porn, no matter how disgusting your favorite recipes, no matter how strange your habits, there's someone out there that does EXACTLY the same, or, worse than you.  Except this little Diet Pepsi habit of mine... no one else does this - I thought for sure all kinds of people would relate.  But it works!

TL;DR My weird technique of tweaking the carbonation in my soda resulted in me drenching strangers at the beginning of their very important days.

"TIFU By closing down I-40, the sheriff was shot


This happened 6 years ago...
I used to sail sunfish. To keep my mast from scratching the hull of the boat during transport I would tape together pool noodles and wedge them underneath as a cushion. I usually tie them all on good but I noticed after this drive that I lost one. No big deal it's just foam noodles. A couple days after this, someone with prior military service thought that my noodles looked like and IED. I-40 was closed for the whole afternoon. Also, somehow the sheriff shot himself in the arm. The bomb squad robot shot my ""noodle bomb"" with a jet of high pressure water it went flying up in the air. I guess you could say I'm the noodle bomber.

"TIFU by calling a multiple parenting bloggers fucking idiots.


This happened about half an hour ago.

I run an education website and was looking for bloggers to partner/advertise with. I follow a pretty basic formula in all of my emails, and was trying to send out as many as possible so I just made a template in Microsoft Word and copy pasted that to each one. Then I finish by telling them what I like about their site, and asking them if they want to work with me. Most people don't respond, so speed is key.

What I didn't know, was that my girlfriend installed a Chrome extension that made it so any time I typed ""?"" it would change it to "", you fucking idiot?"". 

So, any time I asked someone if they wanted to work with me, I also called them a fucking idiot. I somehow didn't realize until about 15 emails in. [Here's the greatest hits:](http://i.imgur.com/nG3t1CK.png)

&gt;Thanks for reading this email, I really appreciate it. Does this seem like something your readers would be interested in, you fucking idiot?
&gt;
&gt;Let me know! And have a great day!

-

&gt;I really like how you preach the importance of one on one work with the parent and think my product could help your readers. Do you think they would be interested, you fucking idiot?

&gt;I really enjoy reading your blog and would love to work with you. Does this sound like something you would be interested in, you fucking idiot?

"TIFU by telling my father-in-law I was going to do anal with his daughter.


This happened roughly six months ago. We were on a family vacation down in lake havasu. My father-in-law and myself are really close and we work together so we see each other almost every day. 

We were making our way down Parker river stopping at each of the bars getting more and more drunk. At the last stop we were chatting at the bar giving each other shit as usual when he called me buttmaster or something along those lines, saying to me that I love to do butt stuff and that's when my stupid drunk ass said, ""yeah with your daughter."" I cringe just typing this, idk what compelled me to say that but I got the biggest look of disbelief and our conversation just kind of stopped.

TLDR; got drunk, father-in-law called me butt master, told him I was a butt master with his daughter."
"TIFU by getting arrested over a meme.


Like many posts this did not happen today, but roughly seven months ago. This is the first time I can talk about it for reasons you will find out.

Let's start here, I was coming home from a college tour (17 at the time) and decided to go on Twitter and [post this edgy-ass meme](http://data.whicdn.com/images/164538658/large.jpg), accompanied by the caption ""Me when I come home from school."" This sort of dark humor was not out of the ordinary for me, and was something that made me stick out from the bunch amidst my peers. I sat at work later that night and pondered deleting the post, but I just thought *Nah, no one is gonna get all bent out of shape over this. I wasn't even at school today!*

But boy was I wrong, while driving home from work and passing my high school, I watched two cars from the local police pull out from the school lot and I ended up following them all the way to my house. I nearly shit myself when I saw their turn signals come on before my driveway. Once I get out of the car they informed me someone had contacted the school over my Tweet, and was genuinely concerned with my intentions. I immediately retort that it was only a horrible attempt at dark humor, and quickly deleted the post. They then asked to search my bedroom and car to make sure I had no weapons, which I let them do because I could understand their concern and probably cause seemed real enough. They obviously found nothing and were out of my house in minutes. They then contacted my principle and I was told to not go to school on time next day, but to come at 9 o clock and go immediately to the office.

This is where my bad decisions start up again. As soon as I pull in I can tell they had extra officers at the school, meaning they really presumed I was some threat. My parents and I went into the office and my principal informed me I was suspended for the rest of the year, as only 8 days were left, and would have to appear for an expulsion hearing.

I became nearly hysterical, as I am a relatively prominent student and had never had any major disciplinary action brought down upon me, and all of this over a fucking meme? There was no way this was happening to me.

After this the principal informs me that the police would come in and ask me a ""couple of questions"" Moments later a detective walks in with another officer, and I am told, ""This is a pretty serious situation and there is not much else we can do. So I will ask you to please stand up,"" and that was when I was put in handcuffs and walked out of the school; the township charged me for **terroristic threats** and some form of disturbing the peace.

I was immediately put on house arrest with electronic monitoring, I was not allowed to leave the house for almost a month. This month was a real shock for me, and I spent most of it solemnly and feeling totally drained. Fast forward a bit and I'm given a curfew, I start working again, but other than that not a word to the outside world or any of my peers from school. By the time of my hearing  July 7th I had lawyered up, and already had walked out of my expulsion hearing with a win. With my clean record and model behavior, Juvenile Probation offered me a consent decree. This meant that all I had to do was serve a 6 month probation, do 25 hours of community service, pay my court fees, and stay clean to have all of this wiped away. We went this route and I had that damned bracelet cut from my ankle that very day, I had now regained some fraction of my freedom, freedom I had lost over a stupid meme.

Six months go by of good behavior (I had a pretty chill PO who I only had to see once a month) and I receive my letter in the mail officially terminating my service. It has been a long, dreadful seven months of my life that I am happy to have behind me. But I really do believe I have become a much better person in the mean time, and have no major regrets looking back. 
It is still ridiculous seeing how much can happen when you upset the wrong person.

TLDR: Tweeted a dumb meme that made people think I was gonna shoot up my school. Got arrested and spent six months on probation.

EDIT: For those wondering, I am very aware that the school and police had to react in the manner they did, and fully understand the severity of what I said. I had plenty of time to think my actions over. "
"TIFU by turning my ceiling lamp into a flashbang grenade


I live in a house that seems like the builders were on drugs while working. It required a lot of tinkering in the last couple of years (correcting the orientation of light switches that are placed sideways, rewiring lamps so that they actually illuminate meaningful spots, replacing door frames etc.), so I developed the habit of just watching a couple of youtube videos and fixing stuff myself.

So when one of the bulbs exploded on the stairway, I just went ahead and turned the electricity off from the main circuit switch of that section of the house. I grabbed [this shade](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ee/83/1d/ee831d9869c4957ec1a4e6804afd0bf9.jpg) with one hand and tilted it up so that I was directly looking into the remaining socket of the exploded bulb. Then, I proceeded to removing it with a plier.

Turns out I turned off the wrong circuit switch, because the stairway happens to be included in an irrelevant section. The moment the tip of the pliers touched the inside of the socket, it went off with a massive bang along with a blinding light. I was basically holding it 30cm to my face.

The stairs were already dark, so the flash completely obscured my vision. When I gathered my senses, I was falling sideways, because my body was trying to escape, while my feet were obstruced by the stairs and I couldn't execute the necessary string of movements required to climb a single step of a stair.

So, as a result of an attempt to be the man of a house that is not meant to have a man:

The pliers are gone. Luckily the handle was plastic.  
I have a persistent blotch in my field of view in the shape of the electrical spark. It's gradually getting better though.  
I bruised myself by falling during the initial disorientation.  
The main fuse of the house is burnt. Had to pay absurd amounts of money to have a replacement during this snow storm.  
When the fuse was fixed, it turns out the portion of the circuitry that included the lamp was burnt as well, so the lamp still doesn't work and the house is slightly less functional than it used to be before my repair.

------
edit: Thank you for all the suggestions. I usually read it twice before posting, this time I just wrote and submitted and I see that it caused some ambiguity. I had no way of ensuring that the light was off by turning off the switch, because it is controlled by two independent switches; one at the beginning and the other at the end of the stairs. So they don't have predetermined on/off positions. Also usually I'm way more cautious with this stuff, because, well I like being alive, but the major brain fart was not knowing better and assuming the light fixture was connected to an MCB that controlled everything else in its vicinity. Things usually are grouped by proximity, but it was idiotic to assume, hence the fuck up.

edit2: I can't give much in terms of visual evidence, because the electricians asked if I'd like them to throw the broken stuff to the dump on their way, so I said sure why not. But [this](http://i.imgur.com/s3SbmOO.jpg) was left. Doesn't show any physical damage from outside but yeah, there's that.

edit3: I don't own the place, I'm a renter. The only redeeming part is that the building is sold while I was still living in here. The new owner was at first extremely amiable, but then his parents-in-law saw the place and he instantly turned all ""get out in two weeks or things will get ugly"". He sued me on unfounded accusations to kick me out and stuff. So I'm silently welcoming all the shitty malfunctions the house is conjuring and I'm more than happy to just tolerate and leave the building as is. Dealing with insurance will be his own karma.
-------

TL;DR I tried to replace a burnt out bulb. The lamp turned into a makeshift stun grenade that went off to my face. Burnt several portions of the circuitry of the house. The lamp still doesn't work."

"TIFU by sitting on a sauna stove/heater


This wasn't today, it was probably 3 years ago.

I was living in North Sweden at the time with family (Originally Australian).  Saunas are extremely popular there and they are everywhere.  Most of the apartment blocks in town had like a communal hall that you could hire for parties/gatherings/bbqs etc. All of these halls had a sauna.

We had a party with a lot of my cousins and their friends one night.  We were blind drunk and thought it was time for a nice sauna.  My cousin turned on the sauna and about 10 minutes later I was the first one in and the sauna room was just room temperature.  So I walked out of the room and told him that he hadn't turned it on.  He insisted that it was on and looked at the digital gauge and confirmed it was at full heat.  Being the typical drunk Aussie I was determined to prove him he was wrong.  I picked up the rock out of the stove (It was warm) and help it up and said ""Look! See!""  He once again insisted that it was at full heat.  I then took it one step further to prove him wrong. I took off my towel and sat on the sauna heater to prove once more that he was a stupid Swed and I was the alpha male.  Well.  Turns out the elements inside the heater that actually heats up the room and rocks were at full heat (Like he said) and I completely incinerated my ass. 3rd degree burns for days.

I then ran out to the snow and sat in the snow drinking beer for a solid hour and then just numbed myself with more beer until the early hours. 

I didn't go to hospital, just bought a fuck load of antiseptic power and burn-bandages. Took a solid 5 weeks to heal. 

The hardest part was I had booked a flight home to Australia to surprise my family for x-mas a day after the accident. The trip is 35 Hours door to door. I had to sit and squirm in my plane seat like i had just been violently gang raped for the entire trip home and pack about 8 pairs under wear on my carry on luggage because the wounds were weeping so badly and the bandages did very little to stop it.

TL;DR - Arrogant Aussie gets swift dose of karma, burns own ass badly, flight home was nothing short of torture choreographed by Satan himself

"TIFU by nailing my crush with a football and making the whole school hate me


I was in PE today, playing football with the boys' class. The girls' class was on the side of the field, warming up to run laps. Only one girl caught my attention, though. My crush, leaning on the chainlink fence. As usual, she was too cool to be there.

As I half-assedly played the game, I decided I'd get her attention by tossing the football nearby her, then cooly saying ""hi"" when I went to retrieve it. Maybe that would blossom into a conversation later. I was so excited. What a great idea!

Well, the moment I got that ball, I sent it flying in her direction with all my strength. Oh shit, I realized too late. I forgot to make that look like an accident. Also, that throw was way too close... Fuck. It's going to hit her!

She noticed, too. Directly in the ball's path with no time to run, she covered her face. It nailed her in the groin.

Everyone went silent as she collapsed to the grass in a ball. They stared at her, then at me. They did not look happy. I was overloaded with horror, between my instant pariah status and the ghastly fate of this poor girl's womanhood.

Fuck this. I took off sprinting, right to the junior parking lot. PE is the last class of the day, so I jumped in my car and got the fuck out of there. I was sobbing when I got home. My mother asked me why, and I told her that I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home and got jalapenos in my eye.


**TL;DR** Tried to impress a girl. Hurt her in a sensitive area. Hated by all. School tomorrow."
