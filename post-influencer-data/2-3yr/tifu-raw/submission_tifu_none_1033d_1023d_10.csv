"TIFU by taking a bath with my girlfriend


Obligatory this happened two months ago

My girlfriend and I were sick and congested.  We were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

She then asked me if I wanted to join.  Sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  She went downstairs to grab our towels and I started the bath.  As I put the oils in, I yelled asking how much I should put in.  I got the answer of only a little bit. 

Apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  I don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

As we climbed in the hot bath, I realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

In my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, I said ""Hey babe, hot water rises right?""

Right away she looked back at me and screamed ""How much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

I said I turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

So we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  It burned like icy hot.  My balls were on fire.  My girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  I'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

I then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  NOPE.  Makes it much worse.

Fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   It wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  Takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

The heat from the blankets warmed me, but I felt like I had ice under my skin.  

Half an hour later, it went away.

And that's why I'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

Tl;dr: girlfriend and I are sick.  Decide to take bath. I put enough peppermint oil in bath.  My girlfriend and I get it seeping into our pores. Has the effect of icy hot.  Balls and asshole are in pain.  Girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

Edit:  Holy shit, this is in the top ten all time TIFU's.  I'm honored and ashamed.  

Things that I've learned since I posted this last night

1. A lot about essential oils

2. My girlfriend loves how everyone is reacting to this.

3. Too many people have had similar experiences.  

Edit #2: THANK YOU WHOEVER GAME ME GOLD!  I LOVE YOU.  

Edit #3:  My girlfriend is sick and I've had a long day.  All of these comments have us laughing and in a good mood, thank you.  We both needed this.

"TIFU when teacher tries to embarrass me in class


I made the mistake of taking a 9am class this semester. I go to a community college and live about 40 minutes away so if you do the math I have to wake up at least by 8:20am to be on time (what was I thinking?). My class has a good amount of kids, more than the average size but not too large. My teacher has a very monotone voice and speaks slowly so when he was going over a test I did relatively well on I chose not to pay attention (I got a 98 but with the curve it was a hundred). I resorted to r/tifu for entertainment. I was reading the story about the person who glued their butt cheeks together, and of course I had a huge grin on my face and was trying desperately not to laugh as I was reading more of the details. My professor suddenly hits me with the classic ""why don't you share with the class what you find so funny?"" Since the class was huge I became very embarrassed and tried to defuse the situation with ""nothing."" It didn't work and the teacher kept pressuring me to make me uncomfortable. I had no choice so I decided to briefly describe what I read ""I was laughing at a story on Reddit of this guy glueing his butt cheeks together."" My teacher was shocked and the class started dying. I was then asked to leave class and I'm sure my professor hates me now. I later found out that he started a new unit today so I missed all the notes as well.

Here's the butt glueing post I mentioned

"TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma


TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma 



My mother’s side of the family lives in Japan. Since I lived abroad ever since I was a child, I haven’t met my grandmother in a long, long time (I am closer to my paternal grandmother). Anyways, my grandma has always been afraid of flying, so she hasn’t traveled abroad in 10+ years, but this year, she decided to come visit us because her time is running out. She was supposed to come to the airport, and my mom was supposed to pick her up. 




However, some other important issues came up, and my mom had to travel to a different city for two days. So instead, I went to pick up my grandma from the airport. (Note that we can’t communicate with one another directly because she doesn’t speak English and I suck at Japanese.) I waited at the airport for 2 hours prior to her arrival time because I was nervous af. All I had was a recent photograph of her and her phone number in case I can’t find her. People arrived, and I kept waiting for an old Asian lady with snow white hair to come out. I tried calling her phone number, but it seemed like she ran out of battery or intentionally turned it off. After all, she’s not tech savvy and she barely manages to dial our phone number because she’s very old—80’s approaching 90. 



From the terminal, I saw an Asian lady come out; she had white hair and looked exactly like the lady in the photograph I’m holding. I assumed it’s my grandma, so I approached her, and said welcome in my super broken Japanese. She responded very kindly and said something I can’t understand; I told her in English that we’ll talk more when mom’s around to translate. I offered to take her luggage, and we walked out together. 




We got home, and I fixed my grandma some food, and showed her to my empty brother’s room [sic: brother's empty room]. I assumed she must be tired so I left her to be. Roughly 3~4 hours later, my mom called me and asked why I haven’t gone to pick up grandma. I asked her, “wtf are you talking about because she’s here with me,” and I snapped a photo and sent it to mom. Then she told me that the lady isn’t our nana. 



Apparently, my grandma had arrived at the airport, but didn’t fill out the paperwork, so it took her extra 30 minutes to get out. She waited for me at the airport. She also didn’t pack her charger in her luggage and her phone had run out of battery, so she asked other Japanese passengers to help her call her daughter (aka my mom) after she waited at the airport all alone FOR 3 HOURS. After talking to grandma, my mom called me in panic. 




Anyways, I went back to the airport to pick up my real grandma, and she gave me a hug. I came back and talked to my fake grandma by having my mom translate our conversation via phone call. She was just an old lady from Japan whose family signed her up for a spa getaway retreat after her husband passed away, and thought I was from the agency to pick her up. I asked which resort she booked, saw her itinerary papers, and drove her to the place she signed up for. Before she left, my real grandma, fake grandma, and I had a mini supper, and I apologized for causing major confusion. 




Before I dropped off my fake grandma at the resort, she tipped me. 







_________________________________________________________________________




EDIT: 





[Fake grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/VlM4kgB.jpg) looks like this. Please don't say that I subjected her to a hostile environment for making her sit on the floor. She kept on sitting on the floor. She was so nice to me, never lost her cute smile, and tried to talk to me in Japanese, but I couldn't understand her. This is the one and only photo I have of her (which I sent to my mom); she was okay with me taking a photo of her, but if someone on reddit is her family member and want this photo taken down, send me a message and I'll do so upon verification that you're her relative. 

[Real grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/AFrn6Za.jpg) looks like this. This photo was taken by my mom at night. She probably loled at my failure. 


By the way, [this] (http://i.imgur.com/eRXfMXq.jpg) was the photo I had to *guide* me at the airport. This photo was literally the only photo my mom had of grandma from the last 5 years because she hated taking photos. Please note that it doesn't really show her face, so I was mostly looking for ""white hair + old + short Asian grandma"" at the airport. 



For those who need proof of the bill I received: 



[Asian money envelope] (http://i.imgur.com/UcYldgV.jpg) She had given me the money in that white envelope; the envelope is from a Korean foreign currency exchange bank, which makes me assume that she visited Korea prior to her travel here. She also left some coins at my house--don't know if fake grandma left them or my real grandma. I'll have to ask.  



[She gave me money] (http://i.imgur.com/6aI1ORs.jpg)


[Brand new thin ass money] (http://i.imgur.com/tNk54nw.jpg)


[She left these coins behind] (http://i.imgur.com/XhNhxyH.jpg)

TL;DR I picked up a fake grandma, left my real grandma hanging at the airport, my mom panicked and called me, and I handled the situation.

"TIFU by shaving my anus NSFW


Had to create an account just to tell you guys this story!

Though it was several days ago that I shaved my asshole, it is this morning that I had to face the consequences.

My girlfriend and I decided to shave our sexy parts together earlier this week, so we did. I shaved my pubic hair down to the skin. Like a baby's bottom. For some reason, I thought my asshole looked a little messy, so I went to clean it up a little bit. The more I shaved, the cleaner it looked, so I just clipped the surrounding hairs down very close to the skin.

A couple days later, I'm at work and my asshole is irritated. I thought nothing of it and I continued my day. It wasn't severely painful.

Then it became severely painful the next morning. I took a look at what's going on down there and I have some ingrown hairs that look like little red mountains of pain and grossness.

This morning, I took my throbbing asshole to the immediate care center, where the doctor had to correct ten ingrown hairs right on the area I can only describe as the ""taint."" I was laying on my back with my legs in the air, feeling the sensation of having my taint pierced nearly a dozen times.

I feel better now, but I will never shave my asshole again."
"TIFU by not asking if a woman was in a relationship.


     This one actually happened last night!

I'll start with some background. This woman and I have been dating for about 2 months now yet I have never seen her residence. After a week of me pestering her she finally says yes, tells me to come over after work. We get off at 2 in the morning which made me assume I would be staying the night, bought a bottle of booze to help the night along. 

This is where the FU starts. I pull up to the address she gave me and park a house away as per her request, it is a very nice house way out of the price range of what we make. Seeing this I assume she still lives with her parents which isn't to odd for a person in their low 20's (we both are), explains why she didn't want me over. Right? After a very fun night of drinking and watching movies she leads me into a bedroom that looks like my grandparents, no color, a nightstand with pill bottles and a real alarm clock on it. Didn't think to much about it, big mistake. After doing the deed and being rather drunk we pass out. Waking up to her phone alarm going off and her yelling ""OH SHIT OH SHIT HIDE NOW"" I get shuffled into a closet, NAKED!

..... Been hiding for a while between a wall of clothes and damn GUN SAFE. I am trying to decide if I should yell ""Leroy Jenkiiiiins!"" or ""no one expects the Spanish inquisition!"" to start my naked dash to my clothes and then freedom, then comes an older sounding voice and the sounds of love making shortly after.... 'Oh shit her parents are home!' I think to myself, now my options are trying to sneak out or doing the respectable thing and introducing my naked self as their daughters boyfriend. I make the safe choice and sit there for what seems like hours. Eventually the door opens and my girlfriend is standing there signaling me to be quiet and come out. I lunge from my throne of old shoes and face plant hard, my legs have never been more asleep. I hear a voice from bed saying ""babe what is going on"" and then i see a 60+ y/o general manager from a different shift sit up and stare into my naked soul. All hell breaks loose and I sprint towards the door eating shit on the wall outside as my legs are apparently in a coma, hearing a thud behind me I pick myself up and run for my life not knowing if he is going for me or the gun safe. I make it outside with only a bloody nose and a few sore spots that I blame my traitorous legs for.

Now here I am outside naked, bloody, no phone and no keys. I hide a few houses down for about 30 minutes. My little soldier is trying to make a full retreat into my body for warmth and my fingers are bright red. Sneaking to my car I jump in the back with only a winter hat from the floor of the car and the fetal position to keep me warm. After a few hellish hours of thinking death was at the door my now ex-girlfriend opens the door and tosses me my stuff and says get out quick. I floor it out and find a spot to get dressed and check my phone, 5% battery and 20 minutes to get to work... great. 
I get to work and keep my head low until the shift before me finishes leaving, not knowing if the GM knew me or not. A 10 hour shift with no sleep was ahead of me. I eventually get to talk to the woman and the first words out of her mouth are 'please don't be mad it's not like you asked if I had a boyfriend'....

TL;DR Didn't ask a woman if she had a sugar daddy before getting romantically involved.

edit for this https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/43xufv/how_do_you_make_a_new_paragraph_when_typing_on/

UPDATE: So I talked to her on my first break and she is acting like nothing happened which blows my mind. I made it clear that we are done and she didn't handle it well but oh well. Also I will be getting myself tested! Depending on the results their may another TIFU on the way but much darker lol "
"TIFU by getting into a random car and thinking it was my Lyft.


This actually happened 2 days ago....

I was heading out to attend a basketball game and called for a Lyft to get to the arena. I saw that my Lyft had arrived and I saw it was a white SUV. I walked out of my apartment building and saw a white SUV parked right out in front. I did not think twice and proceeded to get into the car. I moved over whatever was on the seat (leftover food?) and he began to drive without saying a word. I thought it was a little strange, but did not think too much of it. I then got a notification that I was charged a $5 cancellation fee from Lyft, hmmmm ok, now this is weird. I came to notice we were going the wrong way too, so I asked the driver, ""hey, you're going to ***** arena, right?"" This was the first time he turned around and said anything. He looked me in the eyes and said, ""oh shit, you're not Peter!"" He then proceeded to get very upset (I don't know why) and he unlocked his doors and screamed, ""get the fuck out of my car!"". I was in shock and was also a little scared, so, I was left out in the middle of an unfamiliar part of the city, and I ended up missing half of the game. (But I did get into the correct Lyft this time)

Moral of the story: Make sure you are actually getting into your Lyft when you think you are getting into your Lyft.

TL;DR thought I was getting into my Lyft, but it was actually a man who thought I was ""Peter"", missed half of the game


EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold &lt;3"
"TIFU accepting a free couch


About 6 years back I lived in a dive apartment (my first place; a little one bedroom, one bathroom with a single kitchen/multi room) It was fairly cheap and all I could afford. I took in free furniture where I could and didn't turn down a good freebie. 

After a few months a neighbor offered me a couch. (Hell yeah! It was a sectional couch so big that it took over most my living space!) I never stopped to think why someone would give away a perfectly good couch. Turns out it was a huge mistake....

A few weeks go by with the couch and being the single guy I was and not owning a real bed, but a futon (a real bed was too expensive) I chose to start sleeping on the giant couch. It was so comfortable and swallowed me in all the right places, but shortly after I started sleeping there I noticed an odd rash on my forearm. 

My first thought was that the rash was something in the community laundry room I bumped against or something at work (I was a temp agent at that time doing whatever job floated my way) I was prone to being a janitor for a week here, a box sorter there. I did all sorts of things and came in contact with allot of different products, I paid no mind to the rash.

I had visited a neighbor a few weeks later and mentioned the rash only on that arm over dinner. Thinking they may have an answer or something to make it go away. My neighbors who didn't speak the greatest English laughed laugh and said it was  just a chinche's and to wash it away. Wtf is a Chinche? I asked them having never heard of it and thinking it was a plant or something... They told me to go where I slept and look there and wash them away. And that it wasn't any problem. So I did....

I didn't know what I was looking for. I flipped the cushions over patted around, vacuumed out crumbs etc. Found nothing out of the ordinary and went about my life. A couple days later I run into my neighbor again who immediately ask about the Chinche. I said all I could find were crumbs and a few candy wrappers and that I don't know what to look for. That's when they mentioned I needed to look in the corners and dark spaces. I did just that later that day and was horrified...

What seemed like hundreds of bugs were in the giant folds of plump dark brown cushions at mid back level right where my rash arm was always at. There were clusters of them huddled together with babies and old exoskeletons littered about their sleeve of cushion. Not knowing what they were and having searched the entire couch finding batches hidden throughout went to google.

Bedbugs! I honestly only knew them from the night time saying (don't let the bedbugs bite) I didn't know they were real thing! They're living in my couch and feeding on my body like a buffet every night while I ignorantly lay there for them. They needed to go! 

I googled how to remove them and seen all sorts of  company's tarping homes and gassing entire buildings. Heater treatments that ruined homes by seemingly near melting the insides. Crazy chemicals and pesticides the works. All of which I couldn't afford. So I vacuumed the little bastards and sprayed raid up under the cushions. Sleeping on the couch with 2-3 bed sheets draped over I picked up at Walmart.

I started looking into chemical alternatives at sone point when the vacuum treatments weren't enough and found that cedar oil is a natural remedy at a fraction of the cost. I jumped at it and after some reviews settled on Cedar Oil. I went through a couple bottles fast and ended up buying a gallon. This was the best choice I could of found at the time since nobody at that time seemed to sell ""bedbug spray"". It worked!

Although I ended up trashing my couch, blankets, what few pillows I had and my futon mattress. I was lucky enough to not have much and lost very little when I moved out and in with my girlfriend. She wasn't sure why all my wood furniture smelled like cedar oil and I had to tell her of my battle with the bugs. 6 years later I keep the rest of that same gallon in the garage just in case my son and wife notice anything. I will be ready when or if it happens again. 

TL;DR:
Defeated bedbugs with Cedar Oil and learned not to accept a free couch from foreign neighbors."
"TIFU by eating a peanut butter sandwich


This happened a little over a week ago and I'm certainly not proud of this one. 

I was working my usual shift at a candy shop in my home town. Working that day was this very elderly woman and myself. Boss decided not to come in (it was a Monday so slow business around this time anyway). 

Around noontime I took my lunch as usual, eating a peanut butter sandwich and a couple of pieces of candy. Everything went smoothly for about 20 minutes after I finished. Then suddenly I had this horrible pain shooting across my chest and through my neck. 

This is when my anxiety does it's thing and I start to panic on the inside. This just makes things worse and the pain intensifies to the point I think I may be having a heart attack. I walk up to the woman I'm with and she stares at me and says ""you look terrible! Is everything okay?"" I reached my breaking point and told her I had to go to the hospital. She understood and let me leave. 

I drove down town to a hospital that is local to me. The entire time imagining the worst cases in my mind. I get hooked up to all the machines as all my symptoms are synonymous with a heart attack. My family joins me in the medical room all worried sick of course. 

It was then that the doctor comes in with a half-smirk telling me that I strained my esophagus from eating too quickly. This was causing immense pain down my chest and neck. 

After looking like a complete idiot, the nurse comes in and asks my family to leave for a second. She tells me they have to give me a shot for the pain which made me feel a little better about the whole thing. That was until I saw the needle. This massive thing she pulled out brought back the little kid inside me. This was not exactly what I had imagined, I figured a little needle or even just give me an ibuprofen and I'll be on my way. But nope. 

She tells me to bend over because it's going my ass. I laughed thinking she was kidding. She wasn't. The shot hurt worse than the pain in my chest. It was like taking a nail gun to the butt. I couldn't sit for hours after. I'm still getting made fun of for this. 

TL;DR: Ate a sandwich and got a shot in the ass because of it. 


Edit: Thanks for all the responses and stories! 
Edit 2: Thanks for the gold!

"TIFU by not wanting to eat the sour part of the jawbreaker. Images inside


So this just happened last night. So you know those giant fist sized jaw breakers? Well I had one and I really didn't have the patience to lick the thing all night so I was going to break it and eat it in chunks (My first mistake). So I threw it on the ground and it jumped up and bruised the knuckle on my right hand. So next time I threw it against the wall and taught it who's boss. *(I have tiled flooring and brick walls, also for all of those who told me to use a hammer please remember I am in a girls dorm room. There is a certain lack of hammers. Also the jawbreaker was in multiple Ziploc bags as to not get candy everywhere and to keep it clean!)*

When I finally busted the ball into several pieces small enough to fit in my mouth I had another brilliant idea. Lets scrape out the middle of the jawbreaker, the sour part that I don't like, with my pocket knife. So I am sitting on the floor of my dorm room with my extremely sharp pocket knife and started scraping off the nasty core of the jawbreaker shards. Then I slipped and next thing I know I was looking at bone, I had sliced threw my pointer finger on my left hand. I knew what I had to do and used my other hand to apply pressure on the wound, I calmly spoke to my roommate telling her I need to go to the hospital when I did fuck up #3. 

I was starting to feel slightly off so I started pacing across the room to keep my mind off it and woke up a minute later on the floor with my roommate screaming at me. I had passed out and hit my head on the tile floor. So the roommate called the front desk and the RLC came rushing into our room (I forgot to mention I am on campus, I'm a college student), and saw me on the floor blood everywhere and freaked out. I was the only calm one in the room. 

Eventually we wrapped up my finger and I found a ride to the hospital. They wouldn't let me drive myself, and I agreed. At the hospital they took off my makeshift bandage and it started bleeding everywhere almost causing me to pass out again. Finally I got it stitched up and was sent home. The doctors found it funny how I managed to hurt myself and I was really embarrassed.

Slightly gruesome pictures of my finger: http://imgur.com/a/m76Gr

Much requested pictures of jawbreaker and knife http://imgur.com/a/klTg6



**TL;DR I didn't want to eat the sour part of my jawbreaker so I tried to cut it out with knife and sliced my finger to the bone in the process and passed out. Made it to the hospital and to the doctors amusement got 4 stitches, 2 inside and 2 outside. I still have not eaten the rest of the jawbreaker.**

"TIFU by not having renter's insurance


So of course this wasn't today but back in April of this year. I was robbed while I was at work one day. It sucked. They got two TV's, my Nintendo Wii U &amp; 3DS, my iMac desktop computer, and a few other things. I filed a police report, gave them the serial numbers I had, checked with local pawn shops, etc. After a month or so went by I pretty much gave up hope. The detective that was keeping me updated didn't seem to have much to go on.




I checked into renter's insurance so I'd be covered if something like that ever happened again. Bottom line, it's way too cheap not to have. If you're a renter and you don't have either a home security system or renter's insurance, I would seriously consider at least one of the two. 




I'm posting this to share my experience and hopefully encourage someone to avoid this. With that in mind, I learned something else from all this and thought I would share that as well. Kind of a silver lining to the story if you'd like to hear it. 




One day about two months after I was robbed I was sitting at home and a friend sent me a message. He said ""Dude, your Wii U is online right now. Says someone is watching Netflix."" So then I realized.. whoever ended up with my Wii U hadn't factory reset it. He sent me a picture of his TV and sure enough, there I was.. online watching Netflix. Suddenly I had hope again. I wasn't sure how, but maybe I could get a lead from this.




I started to call Nintendo support but it was outside their business hours. Then I decided to log into my Netflix account just to see what I could see. That's when I learned Netflix has a log you can easily check that shows each time a device accesses your account. It also lists the device, and best of all, the IP address the device was using. Bingo.



I used a public network tools website to ping the IP address. It showed that it was a Bellsouth (AT&amp;T) internet subscriber. I then contacted the detective. I sent him screenshots from my Netflix account showing the IP address and the timestamps, along with the ping results showing the domain. I also sent him the steps to contacting Netflix and AT&amp;T for law enforcement assistance. He thanked me for the information and said he would get right on it. 



About three weeks later I got a phone call from the detective. ""I wanted to let you know I've got your Wii U."" I had nearly given up again by this point so this really made my day. Turns out the person who stole it gave it to a relative. That relative let their five-year-old kid play with the Wii U. Thanks to him watching Netflix I got the console back in one piece.




Unfortunately that's the only good news I have. They tried tracking down the named relative, who I was told already had a criminal record. They ""tried to make contact with him"" on three occasions but were led to believe he was tipped off and got out of dodge. I haven't heard anything since.




If I'd had renter's insurance I could have simply replaced all the items that were stolen. Instead I lost a couple thousand bucks worth of stuff and now I have to go without or come out of pocket to replace everything. Getting my Wii U back was a damn fine consolation prize though.




TL;DR - If you rent, get renter's insurance. Write down all the serial numbers on your expensive electronic devices. If you get robbed, see what information you can find to help the police recover your stuff.




Edit 1: Wow, thanks for the gold! 


Edit 2: Renters insurance, not renter's insurance. I can't change it and it bothers me."
"TIFU by getting super excited at the beach


Went to the beach with my housemates instead of going by myself as I'd planned. We went to a different beach which is more like a 'bay' as it's a little beach area with a long channel of water greeted by built up concrete on either side until it hits the ocean. You can set up along the man made banks with your gear and jump into the water at deeper depths. It's great. Very 'european' for an Aussie beach. 

Got there and found a spot. It's 34c here today (93f) so when my housemate said ""straight to the water?"" I replied ""fuck yeah"", as you would. I rip my singlet off, run over to the edge and dive in. It was cold but not crazy cold.. perfect in fact. I'm treading water when I feel something bob against my leg and as I reach down to figure out whatever the hell it is I'm greeted by a large rectangular object inside my pocket. My iPhone 6s Plus.

I immediately scramble over to the wall and throw it on top. I'm unable to get myself up there because it's low tide but I try anyway, scraping my arm up. I swim around to some steps and as I'm getting out of the water I realise my wallet is in my back pocket as well. I grab my now soaked phone in front of 10's of people clearly aware of my fuck up if they saw what happened. The embarassment is real.

Shaking the phone saw several drops come out. I left it in the sun hoping it'd help evap the water. I went home a few hours later and so far not so good with the rice bag. I'll leave it overnight and try again before calling it. It's a work phone too. 

TL;DR - I got excited as soon as I got to the beach and jumped into the water with my phone and wallet still in my pockets.

Edit: For those who care cause it seems some people do.. it's Clovelly beach in Sydney. TinyURL to Google images [here](http://tinyurl.com/h56anmk). 

Edit 2: 24 hours later the phone isn't turning on. It's my work phone and has AppleCare. I'm the IT manager so I'll try my luck with Apple or buy a new phonel. Maybe it's time to go back to Android.. *cough* Pixel *cough* no waterproofing though *cough*

Edit 3: Turns out I'm not the only one that fucked up that day. Shortly after we left we saw police rescue vans with their sirens on going in the opposite direction, towards the beach. Turns out a lady fell off the 10m cliff and broke her leg. Shite. I think she wins."
"TIFU by using my dishwasher to unclog my sink


This fuck up just happened, but started about two weeks ago when I bought a bag of small orangie citrus fruit (tangerines?). As a single guy, I've been trying to sneak more fruits/vegetables into my diet.  Anyway, the orangies were delicious but there were 20 or so in the bag and me just living alone found it hard to finish them off - which leads to my fuck up.

While putting away groceries last night, it looked like the orangies were ready to go to the trash. There were about 8 left - slightly spongy and questionable. I briefly considered tossing them in the trash, but then I figured they'd do better off going down the garbage disposal in my sink.

The disposal ate the first orangie with no complaint, so I fed it the rest one by one with the water running. No problems. But then.... the water started to slowly creep up and I knew I was deep in fuck up territory. I tried a plunger - no effect.

I went to bed with about 8 inches of water in the sink. When I woke up this morning, the sink was empty leading me to believe that I didn't have a *complete* clog and I just need force to blow the clog through the pipes.

I realized my dishwasher discharges through same pipes as the sink and garbage disposal, so I turned it on and blocked the sink drain to make sure all the pressure was going towards the clog.

As the dishwasher started draining, I could hear the water gurgling and trying to find the path of least resistance.... which turned out to be me and my ill-fated attempt to cover the sink drain. I attempted to bleed out a little pressure from the drain resulting in a rain of hot dishwasher water and orangie pulp... like a citrusy Mount Vesuvius. The window about my sink is completely covered in orangie bits and smells fairly nice.

BTW - the sink is still clogged.

TL;DR- CLogged my kitchen sink, used dishwasher pump to try to dislodge the clog and created a huge mess.


P.S. If anyone has any tips (aside form calling a plumber), please advise.

UPDATE1 - A lot of people asking about the setup. I have a two basin stainless sink. The disposal and the other basin have separate p-traps (not my doing).  Both of those traps are routed into a Y connector with a cleanout.  My plan after work is to pull the cleanout and see how that goes.

UPDATE2 - I believe the clogs is after both p-traps as the water level in both basins stays fairly level.

UPDATE3 - Instead of taking a picture, I drew a [shitty one](http://imgur.com/ZSi30aW) for you fine people.

"TIFU by gorilla gluing my buttcheeks together


Title says it all. I was curious and wanted to see what would happen. I really need to take a dump and am not sure what is going to happen now. I think I am going to take a shower to try and fix this. Any tips to get me out of this mess I have now found myself in? 

EDIT: So late last night I was able to separate the cheeks. They are not sealed together anymore, now there is just a ring of gnarled up hair mixed with dry glue chunks. I think a few more bath treatments and it should all come out within the next couple of days. Going to the ER at this point would be pointless, a lot more painful, and probably quite expensive.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the comments and upvotes everyone. I am doing well and all of your responses have made this ordeal much more bearable. On a funnier sidenote, I am so proud to have my TIFU thread cause someone else to experience a TIFU-worthy experience, which was then posted as another TIFU. Someone else on Reddit was reading my post while in class, couldnt control their laughter, and the teacher forced them to read my story to the class, causing another embarrassing moment worthy of this subreddit. You guys are great."

"TIFU by getting Japanese super glue all over my hands.


This really did happen last night.

I live in Japan, and recently my sneaker ripped on the side. I went to ABC Mart to look for a new pair and immediately realized that if I were to pay 10,000 yen ($100) for a pair of Converse I wouldn't be able to drink nomihoudai at an izakaya for a week so the alcoholic in me deviced a plan to do it much cheaper.

I went to the Lawson 100 store (where everything is 100 yen ($1) or less). I searched and found super glue, and decided to try and glue my shoe fixed.

I get home, open the glue, and immediately it starts shooting all over. I grab my shoe, and start applying it, but it's coming out in large quantity it's spilling onto my hand. Me, being the moron that I am, didn't think much of this, even as the insanely strong smell started to make me wheeze and cough. 

About two minutes later, I go, open my window, and place this soaking wet glue shoe on my balcony to dry, and look at my hands. The glue is already completely dried on my hands, and it's this terrible green color. This is where I start to freak out a little. I go to the bathroom (a shared bathroom in the share house I live in) and start washing my hands. It isn't coming off. 

I try peeling it. It isn't coming off. 

I try to scratch it. It isn't coming off.

I take a towel and start basically sandblasting my hands. It comes off, but it isn't fully coming off.

So after about 10 minutes of peeling, scrubbing, and holding back of tears, I go, get my scissors, and start to cut it off of my hands. What I realized soon after was that I was also cutting off some skin, so I decided to bare the pain, and basically shave this glue off my hands.

In all it took me roughly 45 minutes to get to a point where I felt I didn't need emergency medical assistance to get this Japanese super glue off of my hands. Now I have one fairly noticeable cut on the side of my hand, but other than that, thankfully, I'm fine.

And I still haven't taken the shoe from my balcony. I'm too afraid to touch it. I'll leave it forever if I have to. 

TL;DR - Dummy gaijin buys Japanese super glue equivalent to Satan's sperm, gets it all over hands, cuts skin, has shoe on balcony for eternity.

"TIFU by sending my Mum to the wrong funeral


There's not much to this, only my Mum's friend died last week and her daughter posted details about it on Facebook this past Monday for everyone who wanted to attend, but because my Mum doesn't have her as a friend on Facebook (she doesn't really know how to use it) she couldn't see the details so i looked for her.

""It's Thursday @ 1pm at the crematorium, drinks at the pub afterwards.""

So my Mum is at this service for a random person she doesn't know and sits through an entire thing. She's suspicious because they are all mostly African people and her friend was a 65 year old white lady who worked at a Supermarket but she said nothing. 

At the end of the service she realised what had happened and messaged me and my sister to find out the exact details. In the mean time though, a kind lady and her two sons have offered my Mum a lift to the house for the Wake. My Mum tries to politely decline and says she must leave but they insist, so she relents.

So she ended up at a random house miles from home and my brother has just had to pick her up, she was given a plate of food (which i think she ate) and had to sneak out to make a phone call. As you've already guessed, the funeral is next week on the 8th, not on the 1st.

**TL;DR: I sent my Mum to the wrong funeral after getting the date wrong, she ends up at a strangers house.**"
"TIFU by trying to talk to a girl


I have a bit of a crush on Janie, i meet her a couple of times out and was surprised to see her appear on my suggested friends on Facebook. 

A few weeks had passed since i had added her as a friend and i found myself looking through some of her posts. 

She had posted a while back a photo of Leonard Cohen which i ""liked"". 

The next day Leonard Cohen died. 

kind of weird... but the world is full of coincidence. 

anyway later that night drunk me messaged her and said ""looks like I'm the business of killing people you love. Who else do you love?""

i sort of meant it as a joke and then i was trying to find out more about people she might admire... obviously it doesn't come across that way does it?

Next day she has deleted and blocked me... :(
