"TIFU by choking on an orange during an important work meeting.


One hour ago I experienced this. I am currently sitting in the bathroom wallowing in shame. So at my job I am being considered for a promotion and need to act my very best and put on my smarty pants to wow everyone. A meeting is set up with my boss, my boss's boss, and a few other higher ups so I can give a presentation about my teams progress and ideas of future steps to take. There is a big platter of all sorts of fruit in the middle of the table. Nervous me thinks that I will look more relaxed and confident if I eat something (false) so I grab an orange slice. I peel off the skin and pop that bad boy in my mouth with such confidence I completely bypass my teeth and it slides right down my windpipe. At this point the meeting had already started and it was just moments before I stood up to present and literally all thoughts of everything leave my head as my adrenaline kicks in that I am choking on an orange and I am going to die in the middle of this room. I stand up (which knocks my rolling chair back which smacks into a water cooler and cracks the base), and instead of giving myself the Heimlich which I thought was engrained in my head, I reach my hand down the back of my throat to grab that son of a bitch. My brain focuses on getting it out only so I don't realize I have scratched the inside of my mouth in my quest and I am bleeding. After a couple seconds (what felt like a lifetime) I grab the orange, pull it out and fling it across the room... straight into the eye of my boss's boss... who then proceeds to freak out since the acidity of the citrus juice from the fruit is burning his eye. I squeak out ""Sorry!"" And squirt a glob of blood from my mouth onto the fruit platter....

Needless to say the meeting was cancelled shortly after that. I am sitting in the bathroom terrified to leave. 

TL;DR- important meeting for me, choke on orange, crack water cooler, throw orange from throat into bosses eye, burns his eye, spits blood on fruit platter. Awaiting my termination. Searching for new jobs soon...

Edit: Wow! Did not expect this to blow up like it did (thanks for the gold oh sweet stranger!) I'm glad many of you had a laugh at my miserable morning. Thanks for all the hilarious comments. I had initially gone to the bathroom to tend to my wounded mouth which was just a minor flesh wound on the inside of my cheek. I ended up smoothing things over by apologizing profusely and made a few bad jokes along the lines of ""I had a bad case of the Mondays."" The wounded eye boss man was very grumpy and I was a joke for my coworkers the rest of the day(foreseeing now the rest of my career there). I ended up doing the presentation a little after ""the incident"" and it went fairly well, all things considered, so hopefully when they are thinking later of promoting someone they think of the crazy blonde chick who threw up bloody orange on the boss.

"TIFU by listening to Ed Sheeran at work.


This literally happened an hour ago. Earlier this week I got my hands on the new Ed Sheeran album (Divide). Excited as I was to listen to it, I only got to this morning at work. Getting into work later than usual, and being a Friday, I thought I'dâ€‹ blast some tunes to end the week on a high. Everything was going swimmingly until the song ""Supermarket Flowers"" started (Ed's tribute to the passing of his grandmother). Well almost instantly the feels started. My stomach tightened up, throat clenched and tears started forming. Thinking I could breathe through it I had a drink of water and then the chorus hit and I lost it. As if time slowed I felt the first tear fall, hitting my paperwork and then I was done. Tears were falling as if Niagara Falls had made its way into my eyelids. My supervisor then walked into the room. What a sight I must have been, a sobbing bearded baby. Turning the music down I start damage control by explaining the song and that the feels got to me. But she just awkwardly stood there, saying ""OK"" and then slowly left the room. I composed myself, had a tea break and coming back to my desk there were councelling service pamphlets, and dealing with depression in the workplace printouts. The cherry on top, I have a session with the work shrink this afternoon to discuss what happened.


TL;DR Listening to Ed Sheeran at work, got the feels, lost it like a little girl losing her dolly, now my supervisor thinks I'm depressed and has scheduled a councelling session.

Update: Just got out of the meeting with the work shrink. After 30 minutes and telling me countless times I was in a ""safe space"" she has decided I'm suppressing what really happened. She has scheduled me in for fortnightly meetings until I ""open up"". So this FU is going to have long lasting effects. So really, TIFU by listening to Ed Sheeran and getting sent to therapy for the foreseeable future.

Edit: Wow gold, thankyou! This has gotten a lot bigger than I was expecting. Thanks everyone for the kind words, depression isn't something to take lightly and knowing that the service is available is definitely a positive to come out of the situation, even at my expense haha."
"TIFU by going too hard while masturbating.


This was a few months ago, but I was just slapping the ol' beef and didn't really have a ton else to do. Came a few times, figured I could go for one more. At this point the dick was getting kinda flappy but I figured if I went hard enough it would work itself out. After a while of jerking, my arm started to get tired so I switched arms. Started again with renewed vigor and went basically as fast as I could, squeezing for more feeling. I started squeezing tighter and tighter as my arm got more tired and I kinda started to tense up everywhere, and suddenly I heard like a physical rip and felt excruciating pain from my Willy. Looked down to examine and there were broken blood vessels in a ring around the base of my dick. I then had to figure out how to get my pants back on and drive myself to the hospital without passing out. Ended up in a dick cast type thing for a few weeks, now I'm really horny but afraid to masturbate. 

TL,DR: tried finishing too many times, almost tore my dick off.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that unfortunately I don't have any pics cause I was too embarrassed of the situation. It wasn't exactly a dick cast like one on your arm necessarily, but more of just kind of a thing to hold it in place while it healed. Peeing was interesting. They gave me some medicine to help it not fill with blood every now and then (like if I was to randomly pop a boner) which sorta helped. This was the first time I told anyone about this cause I was pretty embarrassed. Nothing like confessing your idiocracy to Reddit!

"TIFU by waging chemical warfare on myself in my kitchen.


Okay, so, we all know ""don't mix ammonia and bleach"", right? And really, the worst that it ever gets for some people who accidentally do that is burning eyes and a painful breathing, because they mix cleaners, and not in very great quantities.

I'm working on a project and I needed to corrode various metals. Steel was obviously the easiest - just some vinegar and salt, let it soak for an hour, then air dry, then repeat until it's as corroded as I want it to be.

Well I needed to corrode *aluminum* which isn't nearly as simple - aluminum has an oxide layer that resists corrosion. So I needed something to strip the oxide layer. Somehow I came up with the decision to mix vinegar and *bleach*. Okay, so, what I *didn't* know is that even though the chemical reaction is completely different, *it still makes chloramine gas*.

Remember how I said most people are just doing basic cleaning and mixing low quantities? Well I had a lot of aluminum. I made nearly a fucking gallon of this stuff. The only thing that probably saved my life is that in order to keep pets and the odor of this noxious brew down, I sealed it inside a big plastic container and left it just outside my kitchen.

Fast forward to the next day. I look at the container and the mixture apparently worked how I wanted it to - the liquid inside was a dark, rusty red! Time to see the results, and see if it needed to soak for a few more days. I crack the lid off the container and... yeah.

Wow. I was not expecting what roiled out of this box. I had been exposed to CS in the military as part of CBRNE training. Deeply unpleasant stuff. But this was on a whole other level.

You cannot even get one breath. Your passages immediately slam shut and an impossible to stop cough racks your body. My eyes started burning. I immediatley thought 'gas gas gas!'. I knew my cat was standing nearby and would succumb to this long before I did, so I grabbed him and basically hurled him down the hallway into my room and locked him in there. Now I was in the back of the house and could breathe - I also knew enough from my training is that the chlorine burns your mucous membranes - if the cough didn't stop, that was bad news. I felt okay, but for how much  longer? There was a superfund chemical spill in my kitchen!

I suppose it's anti-climactic that this TIFU has a happy and mundane ending. A few month ago I found a website selling US surplus M17 gasmasks. [They looked pretty cool.](https://www.google.com/search?q=m17+gas+mask&amp;rlz=1C1ASUM_enUS522US731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKosq36_jSAhVLQSYKHYi7A5sQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1094) I had spent ages cleaning up some awful residue that had coated it. It came with sealed filters (which have without a doubt had expired decades ago) that I had installed, and I sized it to fit. I even had the gas mask sitting out and ready to use.

I pulled the mask on, tested the seal, and walked back into the kitchen. Who'd have thought that after all the training, all the exercises, all the times I had lugged a fucking gas mask around with me through Korea and the Middle East, the one time I would *actually* need one was when I nearly killed myself in my own home. I had absolutely no idea if the filters were even any good... I had been holding my breath. I walked closer and finally took a breath. Then a second. The gas mask worked. It worked!

I knew I needed to get this shit out of my house, so I threw on some rubber gloves, picked up the vat and carried it out to the garage. After opening the garage door - there I was. Standing in nothing but my underwear, with a gas mask and elbow-length rubber gloves, carrying a vat of noxious materials. I was like a functionally retarded Walter fucking White. All I needed was my gun with me.

I had no idea what to do with the toxic mess so I dumped it all right there on my driveway. Still wearing the gas mask, I began spraying the entire area down with the hose until I felt it was sufficiently diluted. I then opened all the windows and let the house air out for the rest of the day. Kitty got lots of treats. I monitored us both for any persistent effects but I don't think he got any of it. 

And that was how I nearly fucking killed myself with chloramine. Acetic acid + sodium hypochlorite = bad shit.

On the plus side, the aluminum came out pretty good! I think next time I'll stick with a galvanic corrosion approach though, and wrap it in steel wool before immersing in a much safer salt bath.

TL;DR: I didn't know there were multiple reactions that would liberate the chlorine out of bleach, and acetic acid is one of them. After brewing an entire gallon of this lethal swill, the gas mask I purchased on a lark saved me more than the gas mask I was issued in the military *ever* did."
"TIFU by putting toothpaste on my vagina.

"TIFU by having some ""me time""


Posting this under an alt on the off-chance my actual account ever gets discovered because I sure as hell don't want anyone I know knowing about this story. I'm currently curled up under a blanket in my room sobering up and wondering if I will ever feel truly clean again. Be prepared, though, because this is going to be a bit of a long one. And yes, it actually happened today.

Earlier this afternoon I partook in some (legal) consumption of the devil's lettuce (don't do drugs kids) and was, needless to say, not in a well-adjusted state of mind. After my little escapade outside, I decided to come inside and fix myself a little snack. Found some ice cream in the freezer, bam, favorite snack of all time sober or high. Ate the fuck out of the ice cream, as well as a grilled cheese sandwich. Content with myself, I went up to my bedroom to watch some youtube and maybe take a nap. 

I laid around in my bed for a bit when the sudden thought came to my mind: I was home alone, just a little bit stoned, and it was the perfect time for a little self-love session. I grabbed my trusty little ""back massager"" and a pair of headphones (just in case), and for whatever reason, I decided to do it in the bathroom. Call it the alluring ambiance of the linoleum floor and cracked shower door or whatever, but I will forever be grateful for that last minute decision for reasons that will become abundantly clear shortly. 

Without going into too graphic detail, I got down to it and things were going swimmingly. Feeling great. I could ignore the gurgle in my tummy that surfaced a few minutes into the game. Because, much like that gay guy/gal you had the hots for junior year, I cannot make ice cream love me back. Still, the feeling wasn't anything I couldn't handle-- 

until it was. 

Just as things reached that final crescendo, I promptly shat all over the bathroom floor. 

To make matters worse, it must've triggered some reflex because my bladder decided to open the flood gates a few seconds later. I sat there for a solid minute in disbelief, unable to process what had just happened. And then I stood, utterly ashamed, and cleaned up the mess off the floor. That was relatively easy, but I still felt disgusted with myself. 

I decided my best bet to clean up was to squat in the shower and use the hand-held hose to clean up the downstairs. Which I did, except when I went to adjust my stance, I slipped on a wayward poo particle and went toppling over to one side. I landed hard on my elbow, which mostly snapped me out of whatever was left of my high. I cried out in pain as I reached for the faucet to turn off the water. Instead of pressing it down, though, I twisted it to the ""HOT"" side and was promptly met with a blisteringly hot stream of water to my nether region. That hurt INFINITELY worse than the fall on my elbow. Ever simultaneously scald your ass and genitals? No? Good. Don't. 

I finally managed to put off the water and climb out of the bathtub. For the next twenty minute I lay in the fetal position on the bath mat, cold washcloth between my legs, trying not to cry. 

Then my mom got home. 

I didn't mention this earlier, but I'm a young adult currently home on break from college out of state. I'm in this weird state of being where I'm not really a guest, but also not really a member of the household proper anymore. But when you hear your mother scream your full name at the top of your lungs from downstairs like she did when you were a little girl, you better bet your ass comes running. And I did. 

The bathroom downstairs-- which lies conveniently below my bathroom upstairs-- had flooded completely. And oh, shit, I had forgotten that the pipes to the shower upstairs had been damaged, meaning that if you tried to use the upstairs shower it would seep through the ceiling to the downstairs bathroom in the form of dirty, ceiling-y water. I was met with a mop and 4'10"" of angry mother. Instead of putting on proper rain boots before mopping, I decided to march into the swamp with bare feet. 

What you don't really consider when walking in water is that it really isn't slippery until it's mostly gone. So I got the majority of the water mopped up, leaving only a thin film of moisture on the floor. It was only then that I slipped and fell, landing hard and getting the wind knocked out of me and covered in nasty gritty floor debris. Two severely bruised kneecaps and a possibly sprained wrist later-- not to mention the elbow from earlier-- and my terrible afternoon finally came to a close. 

tl;dr jilled off while high, pooped/pissed myself, fell during the cleanup, banged up my elbow and scalded my ass/lady parts, flooded the downstairs bathroom, pissed off a leprechaun, injured myself further."
"TIFU by being a douchebag to an asshole.


So this actually just happened a couple hours ago. Had a buddy go with me to pick up a junk track car that has a very well built engine. I buy the car and as we are driving down the road my buddy's truck blows 2 tires, fuck us right? So with no other option we grab the track car. (Before you jump down by throat, yes it is a legal to car to drive on the street, it is still registered and insured. Legal just not practical; race suspension, race tires, etc).  Look up the local tire shop and head down the road. *This is where the fuck up starts.* My buddy sees a big red flip switch, and decides to flip it. The car takes off like a rocket with machine gun fire shooting out the exhaust. Turns out this thing has an anti-lag system ( for those reading this clueless, this if anti lag 
 https://youtu.be/XBvHxfmeYjQ ) We start laughing and acting like fools on this back road, just tearing up the streets. Once we get into town, we are on our best behavior. Until this blacked out Tahoe starts tailgating me hard, I move so he can pass but he just sticks to me like a stage 5 clinger. It's not just following close, it's getting dangerous. He is easily a foot or two from me the whole time. I decide, fuck em. I'll teach you not to tail gate. At the next stop light I flip the switch, and start reving the shit out of the car. Unknowingly, this not only produces a machine gun like sound but it make such an intense fire ball the Tahoe's bumper begins to melt and catch fire. Thinking I showed this guy, I fail to see a very large man pull me out of my driver's window at gun point. When I finally realize wats going on, another man is cuffing me as my buddy is face down in the street with hands behind his head. Turns out, the Tahoe was an undercover cop car, they thought they could bait me into speeding off, (which is illegal in my city). As more cops roll up, we are separated and taken in. After a long wait and a bunch of questions, I have to pay to get my car out of impound and will have to wait to see if I have to pay to fix the SUV. 
TL;DR drove a street legal race car and used it's anti-lag to melt the front end of a narc car, got arrested.

Edit/Update*:
So thanks for all love and comments everyone. I was contacted the police chief. No charges will be pressed against me, I am being refunded the impound fees. The officer has been suspended pending investigation of his action. There was a dash cam with sound, it recorded him explaining to his rookie partner how he normally does this to cars to help his citation quota. I will also be receiving a formal apology from the Commissioner within the week. I'm really thankful the police chief was quick to admit it was his men's fault.
I think it helps that our car community has such strong bonds with the police and i doubt she didn't want ruin what has been built.

For those wanting pics of the cars will have to wait, i crushed the screen of my phone while leaning over the fender of the car trying to pull the motor.
the junk car is a drift built 240sx with a 2JZGTE turbo out of a Supra. Its going into a a 2013 FRS chassis."
"TIFU by letting my dog in my bathroom, losing a chunk of my arm, getting my roommate stitches and flooding my house


Obligatory 'this happened a few months ago' - some backstory you need to know beforehand is that a) my downstairs toilet has an issue with its seal so it regularly clogs and overflows, b) I used to foster rescue dogs regularly and c) I'm not an excessively private person, at least not with my pets.

So, fast-forward to a few months ago. I'd just begun fostering a new rescue dog, which I'd had for a few weeks at the time. I live at home with a roommate, and she also loves dogs and is more than happy that I did this because she got to meet a new dog every few weeks. Though these rescues usually had pre-existing problems (hence why they'd been given up) I'd never had a problem with them.

The problem started when one day, the Chow that I'd had for about a week - whose pre-existing problem was that it had been abused and was very skittish - was home alone with me while my roommate was at work. It started off very normally; I got out of bed, had my breakfast, fed him, took him for a walk. I'd been having some...'digestive' issues so I took a laxative. And then I went to the bathroom.

This dog had abandonment issues to the point where it'd whine and whimper if it was out of your sight, and I'm not a private person, so I allowed the door to stay open and let him poke his head into the bathroom while I dropped the kids off at the pool. He licked my hand and sniffed around. No problem. 

Now, just as I was about to flush my devil's donuts, my roommate got home. In a hurried effort to maintain my privacy, with my hand on the toilet flusher and a dog halfway through the doorframe, I struggled to reach over with my free hand and both push the dog back out of the door and close it. He did not take kindly to this.

I guess the sheer shock of the noise of the flushing toilet, me hopping up from the toilet, my roommate coming in and closing the front door, and me shoving him back out of the doorframe must have been too much for him, because he went into full-on instinctive attack mode, latching himself onto my arm.

At this point, with my pants still around my ankles, I pissed myself a little bit from having a large dog latch his teeth onto my forearm. He began to shake and dig himself in further as I slumped down against the sink in a mixture of my own excrement and urine as I saw the toilet overflowing past the rim, and all I could do was scream the most blood-curdling scream from both the pain and the disgust.

My roommate quickly realized what was going on, and after the screams of ""get it off of me!"" ran into the bathroom to see me lying in a mess, the bathroom now full of water and bodily discharge with a 150 pound dog tearing flesh out of my forearm. As she pulled him away, he latched onto her hand and leg until we managed to get him out of the doorframe and lock ourselves inside the horror scene that was now our bathroom, bleeding profusely and sopping wet, looking at each other with shock.

For the next eight hours, after we rushed to Emergency for our wounds, our bathroom mess kept seeping through the floor, completely ruining the downstairs (carpet). The front hallway and the room itself were a mix of traipsed-in shit, toilet water, urine and blood smeared across the floor, the walls, and every other surface. 

Anyway, we took our socks off, wrapped them around our wounds, exited through the back door giving the now guilty-looking dog a wide berth and headed to hospital leaving our mess as it was, though we did manage to stop the toilet running any more than it already had. Eight stitches for me, and four stitches for her later, we came home to about twelve hours of thorough cleaning. The house will never be the same, and we immediately put in for the rescue dog to be re-housed.

tl;dr: Let a skittish rescue dog invade my bathroom while taking a shit, roommate got home in the middle of my bathroom time, scared the dog with the combined door-opening, flushing and hurried attempt to close door, ended up flooding bathroom and losing a chunk of my arm to a dog bite.

EDIT: Picture of the arm wound (**gore warning**): http://image.prntscr.com/image/99f83361915548d0ada730b130613eb7.png

EDIT 2: Doggo is now re-housed with a very good family (no kids) and has been since the day this happened, months ago. He's very happy and there's been no further incidents, and I've been told he's almost completely rehabilitated from his trauma as a puppy. Glad we didn't have him put down."
"TIFU by getting three traffic tickets at once


About a week ago, I was driving back home from school just after the sun had gone down. I'm a pretty good driver with a fairly clean record, so I never expect to actually get pulled over for stuff, but after I stopped at a light, a police cruiser came up behind me and pulled me over. Of course, like any sane person would do, I immediately started wracking my brain trying to figure out what I had done wrong.

The officer came to my window and told me that my tail light was out. Okay, fair. Not that big of a deal.

I knew that my tail-light had been damaged a few days earlier by someone backing into it, but I was dumb enough not to test it and make sure that it was working, so even though I was caught off guard, I wasn't actually surprised. The officer noticed. Ticket one.

I gave the officer my license, and after a momentary pause, he went to his car to look me up in the database and fill out a ticket. I thought he would be back in a minute, but he wasn't. 5 minutes turned into 10 minutes turned into 30 minutes. Naturally, my mind started racing. ""Oh shit, did I forget to pay something, am I going to jail?"" etc, etc. Every moment, I was becoming more and more panicky and trying to fight back the urge to get out of the car and find out what was taking so long (obviously a terrible idea).

When the officer FINALLY came back, he explained that he had noticed my tag was expired on the way back to his car. On top of that, my license had just expired last month as well; apparently, if it had been just a week or two later, I would have been on my way to jail. Ticket two. Ticket three.

Obviously, I'm an idiot for not staying on top of those things, but what started out as someone backing into my tail light in a parking lot turned into $500 worth of tickets...plus I have to get the tail light fixed. RIP my paycheck.

TL;DR Got pulled over for a broken tail light, ended up with three tickets totaling $500. Thanks life."
"TIFU by convincing my friend that we should relive our child memories


Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago. Wanted to post it during the weekend to be on the safe side with the rules and then kind of forgot about it...


So it's winter, but my friend and I decide to defy the snow, this beautiful sunny day. We decide to take a walk through the neighborhood where we grew up together, to catch up and talk about life. The usual stuff. As our walk is nearing its end we get to this slope. At the slope you have the option to either go around it or to take your chances walking/running downhill. It's a bit too steep to walk downhill safely. If it's the least bit muddy or icy, it's a guaranteed slip and fall.


This day it's covered in fluffy snow, slowly melting in the sun. So walking down safely is out of the question. My friend is turning right to walk around it. That's when I get this flashback from when we were kids, rolling down the slope, getting all dizzy and laughing uncontrollably. So I say to my friend ""hey, you remember when we used to roll down this hill as kids? Shouldn't we do that again? Wouldn't it be nice to relive that memory?""


My friend is very hesitant but I'm now completely determined to embrace my inner child and get us both rolling down this hill. She's complaining that the snow will soak through our clothes, I argue that we're just a few minutes from home. So after a bit of convincing we reach the decision that I will go first, so I can catch the most of the loose snow and create a path for her to roll in.


So off we go! I throw myself down the hill. Even though rolling down the hill as an adult hurt a bit more than I remembered it did as a child, I laugh loudly all the way down and reach the bottom of the slope unharmed. My friend copies my moves and we both end up just lying in the snow, at the bottom of the slope, laughing uncontrollably. Now you're probably thinking ""how is this a TIFU-story?"", oh just wait...


After collecting ourselves and calming down a bit, the laughter slowly turns to giggles and we decide it's time to get up and get moving. After walking just a few meters I catch a whiff of a very unpleasant smell. By the facial expression of my friend I see that she's smelling it too. ""Maybe the garbage truck just passed by"" I say. As we walk on the nasty smell is still following us and no garbage can is in sight. We start discussing if it might come with the wind from a construction site, where they're messing with sewage system. The smell is still too strong and we can't see any construction going on either.


It finally dawns on us and we're left with no more excuses.

The smell is coming from us.


We look at each other and at first glance we both look perfectly normal. At closer inspection I notice something smeared on my friends shoulder, I sniff it and my stomach drops. Dog poop. We're both completely covered with it. It's smeared from shoe level to shoulder. It's even in my hair!


We both start gagging and realise there's no way to continue this day together, we need to get home and to get sanitised as soon as possible. After picking up the speed, hoping that we won't have to face any other people out walking, we then quickly say goodbye and rush home.

Once at home just getting out of the clothes, without making the mess any worse, was a real challenge. I emptied the bathroom of everything and slowly stepped out of my clothes, coughing and gagging all the time. Leaving the pile of shit stained clothes to deal with later, I stepped into the shower. When I got to cleaning my hair I couldn't keep it in any more and puked over myself, as my fingers tried to get the pieces of poop out of my curly hair.

I still can't believe how the dog poop got all over, there must've been more than one log hiding there under the snow. Most of the clothes I threw away immediately, but I tried to save the jacket. A new winter jacket isn't cheap but no matter how much time I spend cleaning it, I just can't help but gag a bit when I see that jacket.

Tl;dr: went out walking with a friend, I convincing her that we should relive our child memories and roll down a snow covered slope. Under the snow dog poop was hidden and we ended up smeared in poop from top to toe. Puked on myself while trying to clean it up."
"TIFU by not skipping leg day


I am the guy that skips leg day every week... my chicken legs are fragile and don't like punishment. When i went to the gym today i was planning for another upper body workout but last minute decided to do a leg workout. It hurt. My legs were jello and i had trouble walking and even working my gas pedal driving home. I got into a hot shower to easy the pain before laying down to watch a movie before bed. I was feeling better and before bed i had to go clean my cats litter box. I had not cleaned it for 2 days and this 14 pound beast had just push out a torrent of hot ass butter among 2 days worth of land mines. I grabbed my bag and scoop and began to squat down over the box. This was my mistake. My legs quivered once and my mind was racing with ""no no no no"" I knew had lost control. My legs revolted and time slowed down. In slow motion i fell forward and landed in the litter box. My cats recent deposit was still warm and was now on my neck and check. I dry heaved but kept my dinner down. Fuck. Leg. Day. 

TL:DR Didn't skip leg day got covered in my cats ass goo."
"TIFU by trying to use an X-acto knife while wearing new multifocal glasses.


This happened last night at about 11:30. First a little back story: My last eye exam was in 2006 and in the last 11 years apparently my eyes have gone to complete shit. Getting tired of Mister Magooing all over town, squinting to see any distance whatsoever, and having to hold anything I needed to read at an arms length that would make Stretch Armstrong ooze at the armpit with envious corn syrup, I broke down and went in for an eye exam.
  

Turns out I needed trifocals the likes of which I'm pretty sure they use in the Hubble telescope to focus the light from distant galaxies. So, i go and get an eye exam and continued to squint along for the few weeks it took for the new glasses to arrive.
  

The day came and I anxiously opened the glass case to reveal my snazzy new specs. My new glasses are housed in a nice looking frame that kind of mimics my sun glasses. Almost RayBan-ish with a hint of something Adam Savage would have picked out had he not been able to completely focus on his image in the mirror while trying on new frames.
  

Now, if you've never had to adjust to multifocal glasses, let me give you some insight. D'you know that sickening, wavy, room-spinning thing you get when you're about three Long Island Iced Teas over your bodily limit? Well, couple that with the way things look as the tunnel vision sets in just prior to passing out. Yeah, that's what its like every time you turn your head or move your eyes.
  

Until your brain catches up with whats going on, everything is distorted. The keys on your keyboard look like a field of wonky parallelograms, all of the neatly displayed cans in the canned food isle at the grocery store all look to be different sizes, some short and squat, some tall and skinny. It's almost like you're wearing a set of funhouse mirrors on your face. Nausea and headaches become old drinking buddies but most of all your hand-eye coordination flies right out the window.
  

Fast forward to last night - 72 hours in with the new spectacles. I'm a prop builder and motorcycle enthusiast so there's always something on the workbench. So, I'm out in my shop, working on a new project, burning a little midnight oil, getting ready to call it a very long day and going to bed. I was cutting out two circular patterns from some thin leather to use as washers to put under the seat on my bike where it bolts to the fender.
  

Having somewhat adjusted, or so I thought, to the new glasses, I pulled my knife hand away and reached in with the other hand to pick up the freshly cut scrap of dead cow. Now, I had just (I mean not 30 seconds before) replaced the blade with a new one as I had broken the very tip end off the old one and I can not stand a nubbed off blade. That's when it happened. The blade entered the side of my right index finger (yeah, I'm a lefty), at the knuckle with the same ease and effort it would take a samurai sword to cut warm butter.
  

The funny thing about traumatic injuries is that you don't feel them as they're happening. Your brain doesn't have time to fully process the scope of what has just gone down. The blade went into my finger and stopped. Instead of doing what every other normal human being would do, my reaction was to jerk the blade away quickly and violently in an upward and away motion further filleting my digit like a Ginsu knife cutting a soda can.
   

Immediately, blood came gushing out of the wound, covering my hand, the workbench, the leather, the shop floor, the paper towel roll and anything else within spurting distance. I kid you not, it looked like a goddam civil war hospital up in here.
  

Having been a medic during my military service, I applied pressure and elevated to extremity. Now, I'm not the type that passes out over this sort of thing but I had to sit down as I felt the diaphoreses and light headedness wash over me. I started rhythmically breathing to calm the effects and once I felt I could kind of move around, I went to get my wife out of bed in order to drive me to the ER.
  

Enter these damned glasses again. As I went to walk into the house, the waviness of my vision through these new binoculars threw me right back onto the edge of a vomitious, flailing, shakespearian death scene style black out. But, in fine British fashion, I kept a stiff, yet quivering upper lip and made it into the bedroom to fetch my peacefully sleeping, lovely wife.
  

I did a pretty good job of controlling the blood flow but, as the wife was getting dressed, I attempted to clean the wound in the sink by running water over the effected area. Hitchcock himself would have been impressed by the gore circling the drain as the life poured from my somewhat severed yet still attached finger. Okay, maybe not ""severed"" but you couldn't tell it by the amount of red every where. Upon seeing this, the wife's haste in dressing sped to a blur and once again the wash of faintness came flooding back over me.
  

We get to the ER and my makeshift paper towel bandage was doing it's job quite well. Hell, if it weren't for the fact that I was holding my clotted towel, bandaged finger above heart level, you wouldn't have been able to tell there was anything wrong as I had recovered quite nicely from my near fainting episode. I get checked in and prepared to set there and wait it out as I am quite familiar with ER wait times.
  

You never realize how much you rely on two hands until one of them is occupied and you have to fumble around trying to do even the simplest things you never knew you needed two hands to do. I must have fumbled and almost dropped my phone three times. All I could think was if I drop this onto the ER waiting room floor I would need to autoclave the sick people funk off my iPhone. As I pondered what would happen to electronics in a hot, wet vacuum the ER nurse called me back into the exam area in record time.
  

The doctor came into the exam room and nonchalantly plotted his approach to reattaching the flap I had created in my once perfect finger. As thoughts of never being able to play the piano again and having to pull my name from the extensive list of the world's hand models, he began to suture my knuckle back in to some semblance of normalcy.
  

As the second suture was being inserted, my old friend, Passy Outty came poking his head into the room to remind me that I was a clumsy, fallible, blind, oaf who had no business using sharp objects while adjusting to new trifocal glasses. This time his appearance made it so I had to lay down as any and all remaining notions of my manliness exited my body like a cartoon ghost climbing out of a body and floating up toward the heavens.
  

Laughing at my clumsiness, my wife then drove me home and went back to bed. Once all the excitement of the evening began to wash away, I rewarded myself with a midnight snack and went out to the shop to clean up the crime scene and finish what I had started.
