"TIFU by ruining a movie shoot with Jennifer Aniston


Disclaimer: This should be, ""several years ago IFU,"" but I'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events I've ever caused.

I had plans to meet up with some friends in Atlantic City for the weekend. I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

I parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.

That is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I'll be in it?"" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, ""ACTION!""

I start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""I'm not suposed to be here, am I?"" He immediately shook his head no.

So, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. I think to myself, ""if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

I make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn't screw anything up!

After a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they're blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!

Only at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells ""CUT!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

Turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, ""Uh, I'm sorry."" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

TL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation."
"TIFU by pranking the wife. NSFW


This happened a couple of months ago. 

Kids were all on sleep overs. We finally had a weekend to ourselves. Having decided we would enjoy the peacefulness. A all out steak dinner was in the works. Cooking together making our own favourite sides. Asparagus for myself roasted potatoes for her and buttered mix veggies to share. 

Sometime during dinner conversation, we end up taking about urinating practices. She states men are gross and pee everywhere. My rebuttal is that it's not as easy as she thinks. 

Fast forward to the morning. I challenge her to try to get all the pee into the bowl, without any splatter. Challenge accepted. 

So there we are. Myself standing at the toilet, wife holding  my junk aiming. I can't let her win. 

I start slow, using some kegal action to control the flow. She's getting the hang of this, so I up the flow a little to throw her off her game. At this point the asparagus pee odor reaches her face and she doesn't want to do this anymore. 

This is where the fuck up starts. Up to this point she has been doing very well. I am losing and that can't happen. As Deadpool would say I chanted in my head ""MAXIMUM EFFORT"".  I squeeze my cheeks, close my eyes and kegal the crap out of my bladder. 

I can hear that the stream is no longer hitting water. Her first reaction is to turn off the flow manually. Squeezing and bending is her technique. I open my eyes in pain and try to step back. She counters by trying to get a better grip with her free hand. 

At this point things are happening in slow motion. Fear has set in, I try to dodge the income hand, but get tripped up by my boxers wrapped around my ankles. The hand is coming and I'm losing balance. I shifted just enough that she would miss, but take a direct hit to the coin purse. 

I'm falling back as she releases the death grip. Ending up in the tub with my legs in the air. The built up pressure is released, spraying myself in the face. 

TL;DR

Tried to win a childish argument. Ended up slightly concussed, Bangkoked and waterboarding myself with asparagus pee."
"TIFU by going on a date with married woman and finding myself in a shitty situation NSFW


Foreword - This happened over a month ago. The night it happened I knew I would submit the story to this subreddit, but due to the embarrassing nature of the content I opted to wait an unspecified period of time before posting. 
 
I am a single man living in a city in the US. I was raised incredibly religious and recently, already far into adulthood, I have begun to experiment with the mischievous pleasures I have up to this point avoided. My life is currently an oddly connected string of misadventures. Not the least of which happened on the night I fucked up. 
 
One such taboo I have explored is sex with married women. For those unaware, there is a robust online community comprised of couples in open relationships looking to explore sex outside of their partnership. I have dipped my toe into these waters many times with generally positive results. But after the events of this night, I fear I may never again. 
 
I had been talking to Jane (fake name) via text messages for a few weeks until all parties felt comfortable engaging. We decided to meet at a restaurant attached to my apartment building. Dinner was nice and we connected immediately. She’s a beautiful woman a few years older than me. She married young, has at least one child and an understanding husband. The only real mistake at dinner was opting for a second, free bottle of wine that came as part of a previously unknown 2 for 1 deal. We opened it thinking we would have a sip or two, but finished it far too quickly. 
 
After dinner we changed into swimwear and went up to a large ornate hot tub on the roof of my apartment complex. The wine kicked in and we were feeling its romance. There was chemistry. We kissed. Soon we were ready to be alone. 
 
In my apartment we turned the music on and the lights off. She removed her wet swimsuit in a strip-tease performance. All clothes came easily off and we started to have sex on my couch. 
 
ENTER THE FIRST PHYSICAL ODDITY – Jane is a squirter, meaning upon sexual stimulation up to and including orgasm, Jane lets forth warm gushed bursts of liquid from her vagina. I’ve been with squirters before, but the shear volume and frequency of Jane’s squirting was truly remarkable. After a few strong pulses that showed no signs of letting up, I suggested we move to the floor. At that point she assumed the top position and we continued. Moments later the floor was covered in female ejaculate. 
 
ENTER THE SECOND PHYSICAL ODDITY – After an especially intense orgasm Jane’s body became erect and her face showed a state of shock. She ran to the bathroom. It was then I realized the smell. It was a terrible and familiar smell. My wine-drunk brain frantically scattered through its olfactory libraries to determine the culprit, afraid to look down where Jane had straddled. But in the end I couldn’t will away reality, and when all evidence was too strong to refute I began to accept that I’d been shit on. 
 
Said mess was spinning afloat a small sea of gushed love left spreading inch-wise across my apartment floor. 
 
I started to clean the mess with a half dozen towels (that have since been burned). Jane called out from the shower, demanding I join her. At this point in my mind our little rendezvous had ended and this was the solemn hygienic dénouement. But this only lasted a moment. 
 
Her hands washing me and her face and the steam and the wine all played partner, and as shameful as it may seem, we continued our sexual experiment starting again in the shower but shortly later moving to my bed. 
 
Though I had apparently forgiven the earlier mishap, I had not forgotten. I laid down a series of towels in strategic locations and positioned our bodies to have sex on the bed’s edge so that the physics of our planet coupled with the angle of her asshole would form a natural path towards one of many towel traps. The sex continued. I could feel another strong orgasm build inside of Jane and peak. She paused, motionless. The suspense was palpable. Had it happened again? Up until this moment all admission of fault had be implicit. Until, that is, in a moment of introspection she conceded: 
 
‘I keep excreting.’ 
 
I was a bundle of emotions. On one hand, I had been shit on a second time. On the other hand, my shit-trapping towel mathematics had succeeded! In many ways I felt like the sexually deviant De Vinci of this wayward shit-fearing generation. 
 
The pride of accomplishment carried me a second time into the shower. This time we both had a silent understanding that there would be no third shitting. 
 
We finished our shower. I walked her out. I bleached the apartment and I have never spoken of the incident. Until today....
 
TLDR; During sex, a married woman squirted and then shit on me. We showered and continued and I was shit on again. 

EDIT: Thanks for all of the interest/funny comments/and Reddit gold! 

A few questions and comments I've gotten multiple times in the comments section or in PMs 

COMMENT - 'She did it on purpose!'

Reply - That's quite possible. I guess I'd put this at a 5% chance for the following reasons: 
1. There are tons of guys that would be into this. Of course, one could devilishly advocate 'But yeah, the surprise would be part of the fetish' to which I'd have no strong reply. 
2. She seemed genuinely embarrassed. 
3. When she started squirting (or urinating) she told me she was a squirter. She didn't have the same reaction with the other. 


COMMENT - 'Maybe she had a physical issue, she opened up to you, maybe don't make her feel bad about it' 

REPLY - You're absolutely right. I tried to make her feel as at ease as possible about the oddity of the situation. If she or her husband are reading this, I believe I've made the details vague enough to never affect you. And thanks for the story and (mostly) fun night! 

QUESTION - What are these online communities of which you speak?!?

ANSWER - First of all, by community I don't mean a single site that serves this purpose alone. In fact, I've lived in a few states in the past few years and it seems like each area has its own site(s)/ groups that everyone uses. In one state there was literally a private yahoo group dedicated to this. I was invited based on an OKCupid interaction. Long story short, once you find a way into the community (regular dating sites, google 'swinger events in city, polyamory in city, etc) then the path will become clear. This interaction started on OKCupid. 

QUESTION - How could you sleep with married woman?!?

ANSWER - I see no issue with it when it involves consent from all parties involved with set boundaries. 

I actually received a number of fairly scathing super-religious sermons on marriage. Thanks for the thought, but I feel more peaceful and at ease with myself now than I ever did when I was religious. 

I'll try to respond to each message sometime this week. I didn't plan for so much action on this post, but it's certainly a pleasant surprise! Thanks again!

"TIFU when I accidentally tried to steal a MacBook at the airport.


Obligatory TIFU didn't happen today, but back in January.  My wife and I went to Orlando for my birthday. The actual trip was great, if a bit colder than we expected, but still a fantastic time. Until we got to MCO to fly home, that is. 

We got there with tons of time to spare, but it was packed and security was a nightmare. We get up to the metal detectors and X-ray machines and unpack all our crap into bins, and start the process of going through the security checkpoint. My wife goes first and gets pulled aside for an invasive further screening leaving me to gather our mass of belongings spread out in the bins. So I grab my MacBook and cram it in my wife's purse, her carry on, her shoes, belt and coat. My hands are nearly full at this point, but the machine just keeps spitting the bins out and the people behind us are pissed at the delay, so I start fumbling to grab my bag, shoes, belt and wallet, my 3ds and oh shit, I almost forgot my MacBook.  I'm way overloaded, but the people behind don't give a damn so I try to shuffle to the side to wait for my wife to get done with her screening. In the process of doing this I drop about three quarters of the crap I had and so I begin organizing things a bit, putting my MacBook in my backpack with my 3ds and wallet, rearranging all my wife's  things so that I get it down to a manageable amount. Oh shit, I almost dropped my damned MacBook so I decide to hold it directly in my hands until my wife can help me with our junk. 

Well, while I'm doing this, the woman behind me starts shrieking that her laptop is missing, that she can't find it and it was just here before it went through the machine. She comes up to me and tries to snatch my MacBook out of my hands, but I flip it around to show her my piranha plant sticker and prove it's mine. She goes back to flip out at the TSA guy working the X-ray machine and my wife comes up and we proceed to schlep our stuff into the food court area down the way. 

We grab some food at the Ruby Tuesday's and I tell her about the woman trying to take my MacBook, which gave her a good laugh. I surf the web for a little bit and decide to pack the MacBook away for the flight and when I went to go put it in the computer pouch I always keep it in, there was already a MacBook there. It all clicked at once what must have happened so I go to return it to the woman. I get back to the security station and she's pinned to the floor in handcuffs, bawling her eyes out, because she was apparently getting arrested for assaulting a TSA agent. I didn't know what to do so I sheepishly walked up to one of the cops that was handling her and said, ""Uh, I think I grabbed her laptop by mistake"" and handed it to him. Through her tears she bawled out that I was the thief and the cops should arrest me not her when one of the cops said, ""Lady, he just brought this back to you, if he is a thief, he's the worst damned one I've ever seen."" 

I didn't know what to do so I said sorry a couple of times and the cops shooed me away, so I left, and flew home. I don't honestly know if she was arrested or not because I can't find anything about the incident online and I have to believe that the local paper would have written about that sort of misunderstanding, but she was in handcuffs last I saw.

TL;DR:Grabbed a second MacBook in a moment of confusion and caused a woman to flip out and assault a TSA agent because she thought someone had stolen her laptop."

"TIFU by being trapped in a train


So this is actually happening right now while I'm writting this... 
So lets rewind a few hours back to how I got where I am right now *rewind scratch sound*

It's Monday and I have a ton of work to do for school (different papers to write) and I just didn't have the time to finish all of that work during the weekend so I decided to skip classes today and study. Now I don't really like to study at home bc I easily get distracted or I just give myself every 10' a food break wich I ofc well deserve after watching 10' of YouTube videos bc You can't study while you eat right? So my favorite place to study is on a train; now I need to mention here that I live in Switzerland and our public transport is more than amazing (srlsy it's so good you get annoyed by it at some point). So why do I prefer to study on a train? Well you get a comfortable seat, a lil table to put your laptop and papers, a plug to charge your devices, it is very calm and you can have some of those *glancing out of the train window while thinking about deep things of the universe*, oh and you can enjoy a beautiful view of the snow covered Alps. But most importantly I can't get distracted, you see when you get on a train only with your school stuff you don't have anything else to do apart of studying those books. I forgot to mention that I own some special train card (GA) that allows me to hop on every train, ship, bus, cablecar of switzerland, so i don't need to buy a ticket for my favorite study place. 

So usually I go to the mainstation, hop on some random train and start studying until I arrive to the endstation between 1 and 4hrs later. Once at the final trainstation the train *usually* goes back to the mainstation or to another city. So I spend my day zig-zaging aroun Switzerland studying.

Now comes my fuck up...
Like every other time I hoped on a train and started studying... 2hours later I arrive at the final train station, everyone else gets off I continue to work very focused on my paper waiting for the train to leave the station again, either to anew city or back to where I came from. After some minutes you always hear a message thru the speakers wich asks everyone kindly to leave the train *in four languages bc switzerland* (I know this message by heart now in all of the languages). I always ignore it still waiting for the train to leave the station. So the train finally leaves and I continue studying. Now after some minutes I realize that the train isn't going along the usual tracks (after years of doing this I start to know wich tracks go where by heart). A bit confused but not alerted I keep studying. Now the train comes to a stop, I guess we arrived at the next station, after around 10' I look out of the window and that's the moment I realize I fucked up: The train is in the middle of a huuuge/massive/enourmous field of sidetracks where the train company parks their trains and cargos. Before I can even think of something smart to do the lights go off, my phone stops charging and I guess they disconnected the train from the grid. 

So now I'm looking for a solution... I could open the train doors with an emergency lever, but every swiss person knows; you shouldn't except the train is like literally on fire, why you may ask? bc. if they argue that it was not an emergency you need to be able to pay a fine that is around 3000US Dollars. *I am not able*. Also not all of the tracks I see seem to be sidetracks, every 30'' there is some high speed train rushing thru this field, everytime on a different track but impossible to see wich ones. If I would get out of the train I would need to run over this field of tracks avoiding trains going at full speed randomly changing tracks. 

So here I am now sitting writting this TIFU wondering if I should start making myself comfortable for a night or if I might get out of here.

tl;dr I got on a train to study, ignored the please leave the train message, now trapped in a train surrounded by high speed trains rushing around my wagon wich is parked on a sidetrack.


**UPDATE**
So unfortunately my phone battery died shortly after I posted this. Before anything else: I made it out! 
*How*
So while my phone was dead and I my laptop still had some battery I decided to work on my paper until my laptop dies, or something changes in my situation... I mean I was not in danger or anything as long as I stayed inside. So while I was focused on my paper someone knocked on the window: two track workers in yellow neon clothes. Immediately I start screaming thru the thick window glass to communicate. I understand that they are from the German Train Company and that they need to get a guy from te Swiss Train Company, *So I guess I am at GER/CH border*... after 5' they both return with a swiss track worker *and a german border police officer* Yeah I amost shit my pants realizing that I might be in so deep in shit that I should get my diving equipment... the swiss track worker opens the train door with some special key and instantly the police officer asks me if I am a swiss or european union citizen (fyi bc of the migrants crisis they r a bit more sensible lately). Being both (CH and EU) citizen I say _both_ he doesn't think it's funny, I show him awkwardly my swiss ID card he notes down my name and number. They then kindly bring me to the closest train station being in Germany, on the way I ask the police officer if I will get a fine, he says that I didn't break any law so it is up to the swiss train company. So here I am now back in a train, but this time heading home wondering if the swiss train company might ban me for life.... 

**Edit** 
Some people mentioned that I could have charger my phone on my Laptop, I must clarify that I'm using an iPad with keyboard... and I use it as a laptop... but at the same time it isn't having no USB port... *also people wondering that why I didn't have a charger or why the train didn't have an outlet.... there was an outlet and I had charger but I was charging my iPad instead of my phone... as soon as the fuck up began I mentioned that the train was ""turned off"" aka. taken off the grid so there was no electricity*"

"TIFU by nearly destroying a multi-million dollar water treatment facility


Happened so recently that I am soaking wet while typing.

I will try to eliminate all of the technical jargon that I can. Yesterday I was given about one hour of training on how to properly operate and maintain a groundwater treatment facility in New York City. The engineer who designed, built, and operated the facility had quit without giving notice a few days before that and my company was scrambling to find a replacement so I volunteered. Today was my first day working there solo and even though I was in over my head I decided to just roll with it.  I am fairly new to my company and want to impress.

The day starts off simple enough, check all of the hundreds of gauges and connections to make sure all of the pressure is correct, as if I know what the correct pressure should be on any of these gauges and connections.  One of them seems particularly high, however, so I call up the chain to see if that is normal. It is not. They recommend that I backwash the carbon filters (run a portion of the system backward.) I don't know how to do that, but as I am so eager to prove my worth I tell them that I'm on it.

I close off a bunch of valves, flip a whole lot of switches and head over to the carbon tanks.  Seems simple enough to me. Disconnect the hoses going one way, attach them the opposite way=backward flow.

I disconnect the first hose, and it fucking explodes off of the tank. It is spraying everywhere and flailing around like an untended fire hose.  I am completely covered in contaminated, untreated, carcinogenic, bone dissolving, chemical filled water.  No one should ever look and the chemicals that are in this water and I now have them in my mouth and eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I stand there in shock for far too long and I am instantly soaking wet as If I had just jumped into a pool. I run over to the hose and grab it, try to just reattach it and can't.  The water pressure is far too high for that.  Run around closing off valves, doesn't seem to be working. Try again to reattach it, because I'm an idiot, and that still doesn't work.  Now there are warning lights flashing in every color of the rainbow.  All my valve turning has royally fucked things further, but I keep closing valves because the hose is wildly thrashing about and smashing into delicate equipment. There are now several inches of water on the floor of the plant.  I keep closing valves to stem the flow of water.  The sound of the metal hose striking metal instruments is drown out by sirens, several of them, each indicating that some other area of this plant is about to explode. I assume warning sirens are worse than warning lights.

Finally all of my valve turning is successful. The water stops, and I reattach the hose.  I almost celebrated until I remembered that I am standing in a solid foot of water, sirens are screaming in my ears, and the combined light of all the warning signals is burning out my retinas.

I will spare you the boredom of me troubleshooting every light and siren and using a shop vac to clean up all of the water. It took almost the whole day. I got everything back to normal in the end, except for a few broken things here and there and decided not to tell anyone. My boss called to ask how the day went and I said fine.  I didn't know that there is remote monitoring of this facility though, so everything that went wrong was recorded by the system's computer and could be accessed at the office. He had seen that things were decidedly not fine and I have to sit down with him on Monday. I'm concerned I might lose my job for lying about what had happened.

TL;DR I am incompetent but incredibly confident and nearly destroyed a groundwater treatment facility with the very water it is supposed to treat. Then I lied about it and was caught. May be time to get my resume in order.

Edit: Hey! Turns out I'm an arrogant asshole! For clarity, this is not a facility for drinking water so don't worry about turning your taps. The system treats contaminated groundwater which is then discharged into the sewer line. During all of this the groundwater was contained within the plant as well so there's no need to report to the DEP.

Edit #2: I'm not going to jail, I'm not subject to fines, and I wasn't fired. Sorry, I know that a lot of you were looking for blood. I, of course, admitted to all wrong doing and that I handled the situation terribly. Management can see that it was unwise to send someone inexperienced and untrained into a situation like this.  Sadly, there is no CCTV footage of me running around like Mr. Bean.  Going forward I am sure to be more cautious.

This has been an interesting ride. A lot of your comments had me shitting my pants over the weekend so I pretty much ran away from reddit and wasn't really engaging or answering questions.  I've been on this site for a little over a month and this is one of my first post on this or any website so thanks for sending me to the front page so fast.  Hopefully if I make it there again it will be for something I am proud of as opposed to being a negligent dick.  Thanks everyone!"
"TIFU by causing a school wide panic for 5 minutes


I am in a sophomore metal fabrication class. Today was the first day we actually got to try out oxy-fuel cutting. When it was my go to turn on the torch, I put too much of one gas, not really sure if it was acetylene or oxygen, and when I lit it with the sparker it made the loudest sound I had ever heard, like a popping sound, like a gunshot. Right next to my right ear. There are classes next to the metal fabrication shop and at least 2 girls could be heard screaming from one of them. 30 seconds later the school goes into lockdown due to gunshot, the metal fab teacher had to call down to the office to explain what had really went down. There were cops and a swat team outside the school, at least that's what my friend said. My right ear is still throbbing. Thinking about switching electives. 

Tl;dr - lit a torch improper, sounded like gunshot. School went in lockdown for a good few minutes 

Edit: Holy shit! Got a lot more reception than I thought I would! Thank you everybody for the advice. I would have replied to all the comments but this blew up faster than I could reply. "

"TIFU by trying to ejaculate and defecate at the same time


This TIFU actually happened about 20 minutes ago. I finally was able to clean up the mess.  Throwaway because of reasons.

So I am still a student going to Uni. My parents let me live with them still because my University is about a 30 minute drive. Anyways, It was a really stressful week and what better way to unwind than to bop my bologna? I had been sitting in my room trying for a while but kept being interrupted because privacy is a foreign word in my household. I decided I would go to the bathroom because my parents wouldn't bother to walk in on me handling my bathroom business. I figured since my parents were fiddling around with some electrical stuff in my hallway, I would go to there bathroom farthest from them in the house. Easy mission right? Do the deed, flush 'em down the toilet and we're done, right? Wrong. I also felt a  disturbance in my stomach. I needed to relieve myself in two ways now.  I had remembered reading a post once where someone said that shitting is one of the best feeling in the world so I decided I would try to shit and orgasm at the same time. It seemed like a great idea at the time, mostly because I figured it must somehow stimulate the prostate. 

I was ready to reach my climax. I had a shit queued up. As soon as I felt myself ready to orgasm, I pushed and sent my load of crap out. It was a strange feeling. I felt like I had left myself, but it wasn't entirely pleasurable. The horrible scene that awaited me when I came back to reality. 

I some how managed to send my seed all over my mother's beautiful floral forest wallpaper. Now this was shocking for me, mostly because I never really launched a load like that, mostly just gross dribbl- Never mind. Not only was the wallpaper covered, but my pants and underwear. I also noticed that I had diarrhea. Since my anus kept contracted as I orgasmed and I pushed out diarrhea at such a force, some of it ricocheted back at me hitting me, which isn't the end of the world, and also managed to somehow creep out from under the toilet seat and seep down the side. 

Reddit, please don't ever try to shit and cum at the same time. It's not worth it. No reward for a lot of work.



TL;DR: I tried to reach ecstasy, but only managed to send my seed all over my wall and have my shit seep onto the floor.
