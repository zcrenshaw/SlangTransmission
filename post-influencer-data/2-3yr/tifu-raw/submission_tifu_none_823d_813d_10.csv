"TIFU Stepping into an Acid Cloud


This actually happened several years ago. We had a problem with the scrubber on an hydrochloric acid (HCl) tank. The scrubber neutralizes fumes from the tank to allow expansion within the tank without leaking HCl fumes. For some reason it would go bad after 2-3 days and had to be replaced. The consequence was an acid cloud that would sink to the nearby road.

The person responsible was our health and safety manager, who for some reason would not fix it. He was not local, but would visit the plant once a month or so. The guys knew to stay away from the tank, but one day the wind was right and it blew the cloud to a more active area. One of the guys said it was like those gaseous clouds in Star Trek trying to chase him down.

So I confronted the health and safety manager, said someone would get hurt if they didn't fix it. He told me he'd fix it when he got to it so I told him I'd talk to his boss. He was 6'6, maybe 275# heavy weight lifter and an academy graduate, so he wasn't used to people threatening him in any manner. He got really mad but he did finally bring in an engineering firm to fix the problem. We fixed the scrubber again in the morning that they arrived, he asked me to show them the scrubber.

So I went to the walkway above the tanks, opened the door above the hydrochloric tank and stepped out. My lungs instantly froze when I began to breathe in the fumes. I turned around to waved my hands to try and stop the health and safety manager from going out since I couldn't talk as my lungs had seized, but he tried to go around me. I put my hands on his chest to try and stop him and he starts pushing me like I was trying to pick a fight. So I let him step out and stopped the 2 engineers from going out, who looked confused as to what was happening.

I'm bent over, wondering if this is how I die and the health and safety manager comes back in. He's right across from me with a scared look on his face, watching me. My lungs started to work after maybe a minute so I got behind him and patted him on the back to try and get his to work as well. Which they do and we both are coughing. I told him that was why I was so concerned about the situation. He gets a look on his face like he came to a realization and said oh, you were trying to stop me from going out there. I pointed out, did he really think I'd suddenly turn around and start a fight?

tl;dr Safety feature on an acid tank failed and I stepped into an acid cloud. Lungs seized for a while.

EDIT: Wow, more than doubled my post karma. I should do one about the time I almost died from breathing cyanide next :p.

EDIT 2: Thank you to whoever gave me gold, my first ever.

To the people who think I made this up, if I was the sort that made up stuff to gain karma I would have reposted something from the front page before now. I only had 23 karma going into this, and have been a reddit user for several years."
"TIFU by ruining my school career


Can't sleep because of the stress from this and figured you guys should know. 
I'm posting on my phone so sorry for spelling errors.        
For my year 12 (final year) Media SAT (Melbourne, Australia) we are required to create a short film, for this our school lended me and two friends a tripod and camera between the three of us. We thought it would be a good idea to act in each other's films, but since the audio did not work on the school camera, I was forced to use my own Sony video cam. Anyways, yesterday went smoothly, my friend filmed his low-budget masterpiece and all seemed well. Then came today, my turn to film, pack my laptop to transfer files and my camera with spare batteries followed by a bus ride into the city. Great, finish filming, grab lunch and head home. This is where shit hits the fan. Now usually, I check all my bags before leaving public spaces, but his time I decide, hey, let's fumble finding my bus card,grab my tripod, forget to tap off and forget my backpack with my camera and laptop completely. I have rung the bus service and they can't locate the bus without the bus' ID code and I have to wait until morning to go to the bus depot and hope the driver kept an eye on the bag and handed it in after the last stop.
The laptop with my entire school career's notes, holiday homework and assignments will be gone if I can't find it tomorrow when the depot opens. I managed to sneak home without my parents asking, if I can't find it tomorrow then it's only a matter of time before they find out. Not to mention I have to film my friend's movie tomorrow. Pray for me.

TL;DR: Left my backpack on a bus, lost a laptop and camera. Now my entire school career may be in shambles, 1k of equipment lost, no backups and warranty has run out on my school laptop.

Edit: details 

Update: Went to the depot and got it back, everything still there. Apparently some guy nearly walked off with it but the driver saved my ass. Parents never found out, i'm the luckiest fucker alive.

Update 2: Thanks to all you guys for the support, made this whole ordeal a whole lot easier. 

Update 3: Seems to be a lot of confusion about how much this was worth. The SAT is worth about 30-45% of our marks for the year though im not sure. 50% is the exam and the rest is the planning leading up to this assignment which i'm not sure would be valid if I did not submit a finished product.

Final update: The reason I don't have a backup is that my notes are on an old onenote and I have had issues in the past accessing it after a windows 10 update. Definitely gonna backup my stuff now."
"TIFU by battling a nest of nyc sewer roaches. (nsfw language)


*Edit - Thank you Anon for the gold!

I'm finally past this enough to write about it.  I've been rattled by it for days... and I don't rattle easy.  This will be long, and I apologize in advance.


Preface:  I'm renovating an old brownstone in Brooklyn.  These are row houses, all connected to a common and old-as-the-city sewer system.  Earlier this week I decided to try shore up a vertical section that had sagged, and broken some of the retention straps that reinforced it. Luckily this was on a branch of plumbing we weren't using, but still.  I'd be bringing in a plumber to do the actual fitment work, but this, I felt, couldn't wait, as it was an absurdly large cast iron stack weighing hundreds of pounds.   (8"" pipe out to the street which is about double what is really needed for residential.)
.

So lets paint the scene. I'm wearing a cheap-o led head-lamp, which is at best pretty dim.  20-30 lumens, tops.  The basement is very dark and shadowy, with a few bulbs, off in the main part of the basement, and that's it. This pipe is coming down from several floors above, and is in the darkest corner of the basement.

I'd been noticing some ""water bugs""  (a polite name for the largish flat american cockroach that often inhabit basements.  Different from the brown, german roach that will invade your cabinets, but no less gross. )

Now, to keep things in context - ""some"" to me at this point was more than one, alive, at a time.  So - several is a more accurate description.  Nothing infestation level. Several. A few. A handful..   Given the age of the house and how long it's been empty - not unexpected.

I hate bugs, by the way.  I've broken bones, had wounds deep enough to require multiple layers of stitches, and was hit with the gut wrenching realization that human flesh smells like hot dog when cooked, by unknowingly grabbing a freshly welded piece of metal.   I'd rather go through any of that again, than have a bug of significant size crawl across me. (shudders) - My irrational fear here will maybe explain some of the poor decision making you're about to read.

So anyway - As I start attaching a retaining strap to the lowest portion of cast iron pipe stack, I hear it.  I'm not aware what I am hearing, but I'm hearing something. We'll get to that in a minute. 

I'm crouched inches away from the stack, about to stand up so I can bear hug this thing into place and relieve the strain it's been putting on the supporting brace and other straps.

Ever play a horror video game? Where you have a flashlight as your main or only source of light? How you have to scan slowly, with only a small field of illuminated vision?  That's my lighting situation down there, in this corner.

There I am, face about a foot away from this pipe, with a small cone of light as my only sight-line. As i raise my head upward, revealing a small portion of the pipe at a time, something is off about what I'm seeing.  My brain just isn't putting it together - so i adjust my headlamp a bit and lean in a bit closer, looking up along the length of this pipe - pitch black becoming suddenly illuminated in a slow reveal as I sweep my sight and light across.  That's when I realize I'm seeing shadows. Time itself slows.

Shadows of antennae. Hundreds of pairs of dancing, twitching antennae - exaggerated both in size and apparent movement against the wall behind the pipe by the stark directional light of a head lamp LED.  It also occurs to me what I've been hearing.  That white noise, barely audible.. the rustling of leaves, etc...  that was the sound of these bugs.  

What was likely just a few seconds stretched on for me until i actually felt myself ""snap out of it"" and I jump up and backward, away from this small corner of hell.

I'm not okay at this point. I slowly withdraw to regroup.  I hate bugs.

I locate a big ass jug of bug defense spray (intended for keeping yard bugs out of the house.)

I locate my brightest flashlights. 

I prepare for battle.

Steeled for what i have to do - i head back down and re-evaluate the situation.  Okay, there weren't really hundreds of pairs of antenna - just a few dozen. The bugs were clearly just hiding on the back (dark) side of the pipe because i invaded their space with my LED light. Realistically - how many can fit behind there? And they weren't THAT big - maybe 1-1.5"" long or so.  
I can do this. 

The bug spray is just a hand sprayer attached to a gallon or so jug.  I tentatively give it a squeeze, aimed in the general direction of the back of the pipe.  I still need to wrestle this thing into place, so I'm hoping to scatter these few dozen bugs so that I may continue the repair.  I'm still not prepared, clearly.. but i had no idea yet.

So anyway - i spray a single shot, tentatively.

Fucking. Apocalypse.
    
With a few thousand lumens of light on this pipe now, the bugs with nowhere to go or hide, and some asshole spraying an irritating chemical at them - they erupt from behind the pipe.  They start dropping down to the floor. The rustling which was barely audible earlier, is now frantic - and my fear response is lighting up. As i start squeezing that spray trigger with more urgency, I have only one thought:

""What have I done""

I could have, and should have walked away. Gotten something stronger to deal with this. *Hired someone qualified*... but no - there I am spraying the shit out of these bugs with something that only barely seems to be killing them, slowly.

Then I see it.  

As I work my away around the side of the pipe, with all the extra light I've brought - from a different angle I can see that the pipe had developed a large gaping crack, running almost the length of the pipe. It's wide enough to fit a hand (flat) through it. 

I'm not simply fighting a few dozen bugs hanging out on the backside of a pipe - I just declared war on an unholy army of direct-from-the-nyc-sewer-system roachbeasts. 


...So I spray a few shots directly into the hole.


So, hey - remember that scene from The Mummy, with Brendan Frasier?  When the scarabs swarmed in ocean-like waves and devoured people?

This was kind of like that.  The previous response i had triggered was a puny apocalypse.  Very tiny indeed.

Bugs.. nay, angry roachbeasts from the seventh level of hell... are spewing out from inside the pipe at this point. They're forcefully ejecting themselves from this sewer main pipe, and due to the inconvenience of being cramped quarters with nowhere to go - they're all around me.  Under me.  On. Me.
I'm spraying and stomping and spraying and stomping.  I'm sweating like crazy. I hear my own heartbeat in my ears. My fight or flight response is at full throttle.  I may have been screaming - I can imagine some combination of terror screams and war cries.  I was alone, so this is completely unverified - but let's assume I was screaming. And spraying. And stomping.

My forearms are burning from squeezing this damn trigger by now(and switching hands as i get tired).  My breathing is heavy.  I'm wearing down.

So - remember Game of Thrones - the epic battle scene at the wall from a few seasons back?  The war drums. The battle horn.  When the Wildlings brought their GIANTS AND WOOLY MAMMOTHS?  

Yup.  So my barely effective poison juice that I've been spraying in and around the pipe must have worked it's way down to an as-yet unknown layer of the netherworld - which brought forth the giants desperately trying to escape that pipe of mild discomfort.

Now, my friends from down south will tell me that a two-and-a-half, maybe three inch ""palmetto bug"" is pretty fucking normal - but not to this city boy they aren't. Watching these things emerge from a pipe as you're fighting a war to save humanity itself is pretty damn demoralizing. 

I'm ready to give up. Let them take me. I imagine myself being slowly devoured by these giant bug beasts.

It's at this point that my logical brain takes over from my emotional one, and i start grabbing newspaper, rags, and anything else i can find and start stuffing the crack.  I stem the tide of bugs coming out of the pipe, and concentrate on the ones that are now wandering aimlessly, slowly, across the floor.  More stomping and spraying, but less screaming.
The spray WAS working, eventually.  It wasn't strong enough to kill instantly, but did kill. This will become a source of regret - but i'll explain in a moment.

With the adrenaline rush gone, and dying roaches carpeting the basement, I finally have enough presence of mind to ask myself - what the hell am i even doing?  I grab some duct tape, a big piec of carboard, and hastily start taping it around the pipe/crack. I pour the remaining part of the gallon directly into the pipe, close it all up, and go upstairs.
I didn't talk the rest of the night.  My wife, when she came home, knew something was wrong, but didn't prod too much and let me be. I was rattled beyond measure.  Just typing this out made my skin crawl all over again.  She laughed the hardest she has in a long time when i told her the story the next day but I wasn't totally okay for a day or two.

So fast forward a little - the gift that keeps on giving. Seems like this product is a slow, long lasting killer.  4 days out now, and I'm still finding dead or dying roaches.  I clean them up, come back later, find more... repeat. The rate is slowing down - instead of a couple dozen every few hours, we're down to about 6-8 emerging over night. 

Haven't called anyone in to replace the main yet, because now that i see the severity of the crack, that changes the way i'll need to approach it.  I'll have to open up some walls upstairs, and I'm betting the entire stack has to be replaced, roof to basement. I've decided instead to enjoy my long 4th of July weekend, and mentally recover before revisiting.

Thanks for reading.

TL:DR - Started what i thought would be a basic project in an old house. Ended up fighting a horde of giant roaches from an open sewer main."
"TIFU by inducing vomiting in my puppy, thinking he'd swallowed a poisonous substance.


I found him chewing at a packet of silica gel, and since they often have those ""Do not ingest"" warnings, I panicked and thought they were poisonous. I though it would be rapidly absorbed into his bloodstream, so I instantly gave him a teaspoon of salt to make him throw up, and he threw up *violently*. I had a flight to catch just afterwards, so I had to miss it to rush him to the vet because I thought he'd die. Anyway, once we got there, the vet told us that silica gel isn't toxic to dogs, and that he was just a little dehydrated because of the vomiting. So now I'm booking another flight, and my poor puppy is giving me the stink eye because I think he knows I was responsible for his troubles. 

tl;dr: I forced my dog to puke out a substance I thought was toxic but wasn't actually so, leaving him dehydrated. I also had to miss my flight and take him to the vet because I mistakenly thought he was going to be very sick. 

Edit: [this is a picture of him](https://i.imgur.com/bbLrYjq.jpg)

"TIFU by throwing up into a McDonald's bag while driving.


So last night I was spending time with my family to honor my late grandfather by drinking gin and tonics. Nothing too crazy or over the top, probably two G&amp;Ts and then a beer or two. For some reason it got me good though, and I was throwing up at my cousin's house all morning. I thought I had my vom sessions timed out perfectly and would be able to make it home in time without any disasters occurring on the drive home. So as soon as I yaked for the third time, I grabbed my stuff, ran out to my car, did some deep breathing and prayed to the G&amp;T gods that I'd make it home.

They heard my prayers and must have cackled, because five minutes down the road from my cousins I started to get that ""oh shit I'm about to throw up"" feeling in my mouth - you know the one. So I did the only thing I could do and grabbed a little brown paper McDonald's bag that was chilling in my passenger's seat from the night before and yakked my brains out into it while driving down a busy city street. Always keeping it classy. I put the vom bag down on the floor of my passenger's side and cranked my AC and hoped that was the end of it.

I was wrong. I got stuck in shore traffic coming over the bridge into NJ and caught a whiff of something foul (more likely than not it was my own puke) and got that trigger feeling again. I didn't know what to do so in my scrambled state of mind, I grabbed the McDonald's bag again. As I'm puking into it, the bottom of the bag gives out and its contents completely pour all over me. I spent the next 30 minutes of my drive home crying and sitting in my own vomit.

TL;DR I had to throw up while driving home, puked into the nearest container I had (McDonald's brown paper bag). Had to vom again, the bag broke all over my lap, and I spent a half hour crying while sitting in my own vomit."
"TIFU by eating edibles at work


So this was actually last Wednesday to be clear. I work at a tire shop. About two months ago a customer came in after her vehicle was finished and asked me if I would take some weed brownies if she brought them over. I said well yes of course ! I even told my boss and he just laughed it off. Fast forward to last Wednesday I'm sitting on a stack of rims eating my Korean BBQ for lunch. She walks in with a bag of brownies sliced into small square cubes. I divide them amongst my two coworkers evenly and I eat one piece (she advised one piece would be plenty.) the smart guy I am. I waited bout 15 minutes and said jeez these are weak ! So I ate about 4 more pieces. Two hours later I might as well be a vegetable. Can't even speak a full sentence. Got hit in the head with the hood of a balancing machine so hard that I literally went to the bathroom mirror to make sure I didn't have a huge dent on my scalp. Could barely do any work and grew more paranoid by the minute. Could not wait to go home. Also at the end of the day I as having a smoke with my manager and I told him I ate the brownies at lunch. He was pretty mad, but I figure I'd tell him because my eyes were as red as the devils dick. 

TL;DR I underestimate the power of weed edibles at work, almost lost my head and my job. Sorry if this was a boring story it was entertaining IRL and I thought it would read better "
"TIFU by letting a stranger check a new phone.


So, I work in a store where we sell phones and their equipments. And today, at 3 pm, a  crippled guy came to the store. He didn't say anything, he just came forward and started checking the phones we had. He started pointing at phones, and asking about the price and stuff, his way of speaking wasn't clear enought but I could understand what he was saying. He then asked me to hand him a phone name "" ARCHOS "", so I did.
Now, here is where shit started to get messed up without me realizing it. This phone has the bettery integrated with the phone, so he started turning it on. We usually keep the phones without a battery, cause people sometimes mess up stuff. But, I didn't want to hurt his feelings or anything, so I just went with it, and waited for him to check that phone. He then wanted to negotiate, but turned out he didn't have the enough money, he started asking about other phones...ect, then left. 
After he left, I wanted to turn the phone off again. To my surprise, the dude put a pattern lock to the phone. I didn't freak out much, cause i knew I can hard reset it, and ofc I was wrong. My man changed the language to chineese as well, and even the recovery mode is now in chinese and I can't find the "" reset option"" 

this is what the screen looks like 

http://imgur.com/a/bozzs

i would appreciate it if anyone tells me whicch one is that option. 

tl;dr I gave a dude a phone to check, he changed the language and put a pattern lock on it, and now I am ineed of translation


edit: It is allll fixed thanx to shay2k and also to anyone who tried to help . thank u guys.
edit2: this is my first tifu, and I forgot to edit the topic. For those kind people who suggest that I take a same model phone and just check the steps, then do the qame to the other, I couldn't. Because, that phone was the last one we had.

"TIFU by rinsing my contacts with acid before putting them in


TL;DR I washed my contacts in a weak acid before placing them directly on my eyes, then cried a lot before throwing them away and using a fresh pair. 


I use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for my contacts overnight. I always let them sit for at least 8 hours. The acidic solution cleans them better for me, which is why I switched a few years ago. The instructions clearly say to leave them in solution for at least 6 hours for the lens holder to neutralize the acid and prevent what must be equivalent to using Tabasco as an eye dropper. 

Now, I always let them sit for at least 7 hours. But, near the end of the bottle and lens holder lifespan (should change holder with bottle as it loses efficacy) the solution doesn't always completely neutralize so it's recommended to give the lenses a bath with neutral lens solution. This morning, in my haze I grabbed the hydrogen peroxide instead and gave the lenses a nice acid bath and inserted my left contact. 

Everything was on fire. I wanted to gouge my eye out. Eyes, nose both running, I start sweating like a cold beer on the beach, I was cursing like an animal... I could barely open my eye to reach in and get the devil's lens out. 

Finally got it out and threw it onto the counter, washed my eye with normal solution, cried a bit, then bathed both contacts with normal solution for a long time, before trying righty. Same situation. Decided to call it quits on those lenses and just get a new pair, after standing in the shower with my eyes open for a few minutes. 

An hour later, both eyes still puffy and watery and I look like I got super high before coming in to work. 

Pro tip: if you use the hydrogen peroxide solution, keep your bottles in separate locations to avoid the worst morning you'll ever have.

"TIFU by not moving my file onto dropbox.


So this happened 2 hours ago: I was doing my work at my uni for my assignment due Thursday - a 360 panoramic digital painting. I made great progress today and basically got most of the background work done, and even have some nice details drawn in - a really solid 6 hours of work.

I saved my file and logged off. Then I realised just now when I got home that I saved my file onto my school computer's desktop, which everything gets removed after I log out.

If there is a saving grace, it's that I am confident that I can replicate what I already did fairly quickly, but right now I am going through all the scenarios in which I might have a chance at recovering my 6 hours of work.

TL;DR: Saved my work in a temporary folder in my school server and lost my whole day of progress for a project due in less than 40 hours.

-

Edit: Done my work for today. Presentation in 6 hours. Didn't get to recover my original file.

Not a paid shill. If Dropbox wasn't a requirement from this course's professor I'd have settled for anything else just as well.

Not a fine arts major. Game design major. Apparently some people didn't know design requires drawing. Suggestion: start paying attention to real life. Literally everything man-made is designed, using drawings, to make pretty pictures, and habitable places.

Thanks to the people who are being sensible / logical / helpful. You guys are in the majority and you guys make this world a better place. As promised: [link](https://naietz.artstation.com/projects/LVVNA) to my finished artwork."
"TIFU by breaking my brand new $1000 phone with 1000 amps of electricity


Unlike most of the fuckups posted here, this happened 45 minutes ago.

To give you a little background, last weekend I took apart my old microwave and salvaged a 1000W transformer. For those that don't know, a microwaves transformer takes a low voltage, and increases it, decreasing the current. I modified mine so that it would decrease the voltage, and increases the current (amperage for Americans). So it turns 230v AC into about 1v with 1000amps.

I have been having a lot of fun with this because I can use it to instantly melt nails and other metal objects, creating a lot of sparks in the process.

Yesterday my new Samsung Galaxy S8+ arrived, it cost me about $1000, a phone renowned for its superb camera. So about 50 minutes ago now, I had the genius idea of filming me melting a nail in slow motion. How cool would that be? And what could go wrong?

So I set up my shiny new phone about 20cm (~8 inches) from the nail and melted it. Sparks flew everywhere, damn it looked awesome. That was until I looked at the back of my now not so shiny phone. The sparks were so hot that they had cracked the glass back of the phone, not limited to the camera lens and fingerprint reader, rendering them useless.

TL;DR
Cracked the entire back of my brand new phone including camera and fingerprint scanner by showering it in sparks.

Thank you for the gold kind stranger"
