"TIFU by getting diarrhea at the beach.


Hey Reddit!

So I've been traveling in Africa for a while, now. About four days ago, I got reeally sick. I was puking all day, had diarrhea, stomach aches... It really sucked. Nothing seemed to help. 

Fast forward to today and still I haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since I got sick. I was feeling better, but really faint because I hadn't eaten. I had a light breakfast and decided that I was going to go to the beach. I know that a lot of places here don't have washrooms, so I chose wisely and went to a  beach front bar where I was 100% certain that they had a bathroom.

So I'm on the beach, tanning, drinking water, reading... When all of a sudden, I need to shit *NOW*. So I get up and hobble over to the washroom with my butt muscles tensed up as to not leak liquid shit everywhere.

*""Lady! Lady! Sorry, the bathroom's getting repaired right now, you can't go in,""* the bartender explains. *""WHAT NO IT'S OK I'LL USE IT ANYWAYS!"" ""Umm, no you can't, there's someone fixing it.""*

I was desperate, and I told him it was an emergency, and he laughed it off saying, *""Just go in the ocean, everyone does.""* Turns out the closest bathroom was a 7-10 minute walk away...

So get into the water and start swimming out as fast as I can. I get about twice as far as the second furthest person... I look around. No boats, no surfers, no swimmers... ok. 

I pull down my bathing suit and start to let out a massive load of orange pudding-like shit. It creates this DISGUSTING cloud... and half started floating up, so I swim a few meters away with my bottoms still down.

Then... I look down into the water and see there's four fucking scuba divers about 2 meters below me, COMPLETELY grossed out, pointing at my cloud of diarrhea to warn each other and swimming away as fast as they could. I shit on scuba divers. 

I left the beach immediately and now I'm back at my hotel.

**TL;DR: Went to the beach hoping I didn't have diarrhea anymore, desperately had to shit, decided to go in the ocean, ended up accidentally shitting on a group of scuba divers.**"
"TIFU by pissing on a toddler.


Okay so this was a new low for me and I'm Irish so you know that's gotta atleast be a bitta craic.


So earlier today I'm in town playing Pokémon Go and I've just came across a poke stop with a lure activated. I have to pee but I figured I'll stand about for a couple of minutes and see if anything cool appears and Christ am I happy when a lvl 932 Aerodactyl appears. I click on the bastard and start chucking balls. Well, I don't know if it was the need to slash or just the game fupping with me but could I catch the bastard? Nope, ten balls ten misses. Each ball I throw seems to curve more than the last and this grey ballocks is flapping his wings at me, Fifteen balls and he escapes twice, One ball left and I hit him, of course he escapes and runs away. ""Fuck sake"" I whisper and realized in my pacing I've heightened then need to pee greatly. So I head for the nearby shopping centre two streets away.



As I approach the corner entrance to the shopping centre I'm about to burst, I've inherited my fathers bladder and at 32 years of age I pee at least 20 times a day and by fuck do they come on quick and fast. I'm practically running at this point and as I reach the door this little kid comes full speed and runs into me, head first into my crotch.



Well I don't need to tell you what happened next but I will because its the whole point of the story, when he headbutted my goolies I pissed, a lot. Wearing shorts this piss flowed down my legs and all over this kid, it was all down his wee shirt and trousers and I was soaked. His mum was mortified and his dad laughed so loud the whole shop was watching, I apologised and explained I wasn't feeling well, I didn't know what to do. Poor kid started crying and I'm stood there just ashamed. The parents where pretty understanding though and apologised for their kid, I think they just pitied me, I would. 


I walked the two miles home in piss drenched shorts and foot wear and cursed the entire walk.


At least in future when that kid runs from his parents they can say ""do you remember what happened last time?"" and he'll think of that giant ginger bearded wanker who pissed on him.


Fucking Aerodactyl.




TL;DR : Decided to try and catch a pokemon instead of going to the loo, ended up pissing on a kid who ran into me on my way to the toilet.


EDIT: Which one of you sick fucks gave this post a golden shower? Thank you, I'm glad my misfortune can cause some laughs! "
"TIFU by Asking a Girl Out


So there's some things you have understand before I start this story.  I'm in grade ten of high school (this happened in June, so about a month ago).  I am an incredibly anti-social person.  Up until this point I have never even tried to ask a girl out.  This was my first time EVER.  So I walk up to her, absolutely terrified, and just before I say anything, I trip on a crack in the side walk and land right on my face.  I get up instantly and try to play it off, blood gushing out of my nose.  She is freaking, and I'm stumbling around mumbling ""its okay, I'm fine, I'm fine"" when I fall for a second time, this time backwards, cracking the back of my head against the sidewalk, knocking me out cold.  I wake up in the hospital a few hours later, luckily with no serious injuries, except maybe my pride.

TL;DR Tried to ask a girl out, ended up in hospital"
"TIFU by faking appendicitis and getting my Appendix removed.


Back in 1985 I had just returned from the US as an AFS student. After school was out for the summer, I had no real plans, and had not a lot of money. I found this interesting advert in a newspaper for a youth camp in DDR in East-Berlin. It said, work 2 weeks of solidarity work with students and have one week of bathing vacation by the Baltic Sea, for a small sum of about $100. 

It was organized by the Friendship organization Norway-DDR. I got excited and wanted to see the other side of the iron curtain, since I had just spent one year in USA. It never hurt to see the world, and DDR was not a typical tourists place one could say. I signed up. We were traveling by train, and I was the only boy in a group of 10 people. It was me, and 9 girls. We also had an adult chaperone who was a teacher at a high school and in his 50s. 

The whole trip was surreal, and I could write a book about the whole experience. We were greeted by Youth Pioneers in blue uniforms and a marching band. Since we were only 11 people and not the 100 they had hoped for, the whole thing was rather embarrassing and cringe worthy. They set us up in a camp with military style tents, and I notice that most of the other participants in this ""solidarity camp"" were female.  One huge tent for showering and it was unisex to my shy surprise. The idea of the camp was that students filled the workers jobs so they could have a vacation. The work consisted in digging down a cable along the railroad tracks outside Potsdam. We were driven in huge military style trucks every morning, the kind they transport troops in. The third day, we had wine and a little party with some of the girls in the neighboring tents. I was 17 at the time and had only tried alcohol once before. I drank Sekt, a type of bubbly wine. A lot. 

The next day, I woke up to my second hangover ever. It was awful. We drove the trucks, I got sick, and puked in the truck, out of the truck and just everywhere. Not wanting to look like I could not handle alcohol, I said I had a stomach pain when we got to the work place. I got to lay down, and I continued to fake the pain. Although I must admit I was feeling pretty bad and sick, but had no pain. After an hour, one of the translators came over to me and said they were going to take me to a doctor. He worked for STASI, I later found out. Since we were guests of the DDR government, they wanted to show that they took good care of their guests. We drove about half an hour to the doctors office. The female doctors ( not nurses) with strange white hats, lead me in to a bed behind some screens and gave me a rectal thermometer. 

They left me and  said they would check on me in a few minutes. Not wanting to disappoint them, I put the thermometer on a lamp, and it soon showed I had a low fever.  They came back and pressed on my stomach and I politely screamed. They then decided to move me to a hospital by ambulance. The same procedures were done there, but I left the thermometer to long on the lamp, and now it showed me having a high fever. Things went fast from there. Before I could protest, my German was not very good, I was given pre surgery medication and some strong pain medication into my arm. I was put under before I could tell them I was lying. When I woke up, I screamed "" Ich hat kein schmerz"" ( I had no pain) and discovered they had removed my appendix. 

The next 4 days I stayed at the hospital was awful. I got something called Bitter Wasser I think, to get my bowls moving. I got sent home on a plane, and they never admitted that my appendix was not infected. I did not either. So now I have a scar that reminds me that I should never ever lie about serious medical conditions, but on the other hand, I never had to fear Appendicitis if I took a long hike in the mountains... I was young and stupid. 

TL;DR  I faked stomach pain to cover over the fact I was hungover and got my appendix removed.

Edit a bit for spelling. First post, so sorry if I do it wrong. 

I promised some photos. Will not post identifiable pix of ppl, but here are some B/W pictures I took at the camp

Oh, and I never said I did not have sex... BTW, I never put the thermometer in my ass after heating it. I never dreamed that they were going to operate. I was still hungover and did clearly not think straight.

"TIFU - Preparing for the wife!


So today I fucked up.  Tomorrow is our 10-year Anniversary night.  We've dumped the kids off at Mom's and tomorrow we're heading back to England for a week.  She's British, wants to spend a week in England.  Cool. 

The wife has meticulously womanscaped her area for me I know, because that's the only time she takes 2 hour long showers.  So I think to myself... well.. Maybe I'll return the favor.

So I sneak out to the hell that is Walmart to surprise her by doing some serious manscaping.  I keep the area nice, but I'm gunna go full retard and napalm the area.  I spend ten minutes awkwardly standing in the aisle looking at the hundreds of options for waxes, hair removal cream, etc.  I end up going with Nair for sensitive areas.  I figure that's the best choice.

So I get home and carefully read the directions.  Apply liberally to the area, wait ten minutes and wipe with a towel, the hair should go with it.  I ignore the warning about applying directly to genitals because I'm a man.  Hear me fucking roar.

So I apply this cream thick.  Real thick, everywhere.  I wait the ten minutes and wipe it off, nothing happens.  Fuck.  This didn't work.  So I try again, liberally apply the rest of the bottle back onto the area, put my boxers on to hide what I'm doing from the wife; it's still a surprise... and sit on the couch and fire up some Youtube.  I figure I'll wait 15 minutes this time and try again.

Nope. 

I wake up 5 hours later.  My junk is numb, very numb.  I stand up slowly and I can feel cracking, I can feel things falling down my pants leg.  As I slowly penguin over to the bathroom, a trail of crusted pieces of Nair falling to the floor behind me, I gently pull my boxers away from the skin, and pieces of what looks like skin are coming with it.  This isn't good.  The nair has dried and has adhered to my skin.  

I run a cold bath and jump in, letting the water re-hydrate the nair so that I can gently wipe it off.  Slowly the water is turning red, I realize, red with blood.  This is where the panic sets in.  As I painstakingly remove the nair, feeling starts returning.  My testicles are on fire.   I begin to sob like a bitch.  I slowly make my way out of the bathroom, saddle-walking like you've never seen, searching for something to sooth the hellfire that is between my legs.

Baby oil.  That will do the trick, I think.  You put baby oil on babies to keep their skin nice, surely that will sooth my hot balls of fire.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

I've never cried so hard in my life, it was as if cthulu had fisted my frank and beans with a flaming iron bar.  Apparently you don't put oil on burns.

I now have a severe chemical burn on my junk, it's blistering, and I have to be on a plane for a 16 hour flight in a few hours for a very sexless anniversary vacation.

Worst part?  Most of the hair was still there, somehow.  I don't understand it.  As I said previously, I set out on a mission to go full retard and napalm the shrubbery and all I managed to achieve was to scorch the earth.

tl;dr Fell asleep with Nair on my balls.  Then soothed it with baby oil.  Blistered testicles suck, day before 10 year anniversary.

*****************************UPDATE****************************************

After having sat in the tub for a few hours I did heed your advice and head to the ER after little blisters started forming.  And I'd ran out of ice in the house to sooth the area.

And my whiskey bottle was empty.

The pain had mostly subsided by the time I'd gotten to the ER.  Well, I lie.  It still fucking hurt, but it was nothing like the hellfire I'd felt the moment I decided applying baby oil to a burn would be a wise idea.

Hobbling into to ER they were looking at me funny, demanding I sit down in a wheelchair.  The last thing I wanted to do was sit, can't spread my legs far enough apart sitting down in a damn wheel chair, needless to say skin-to-skin contact was the worst, I needed to let my jewels breath.

I did ask to speak to a male nurse; they all assumed by the way I was walking I'd broken my tail bone I think.  It took a while for them to find a guy for me to talk to, for whatever reason I just wanted to talk to a dude about my medical emergency.  The guy couldn't keep a straight face, and thought I was joking.

So after an excruciating two-hour wait in the ER I finally got a room and got to see the doctor.  They had me take another shower and sponged the area clean.  I've never been uh; cleaned before.  By someone else.  I'm sure they were just trying to ensure that I'd removed all the cream, but by that point between the wife and I, I'm fairly confident we'd gotten it with the 3 hours I'd spent in the tub. Not the most pleasant experience.

Showing me how to gauze the area was probably the worst experience, though.  It seems like they were trying to figure it out themselves.  It took them a few tries before they had the technique figured out, and as I stated previously; all of this still hadn't removed all of the fucking hair.  I can say that most of it is gone now, the amount of times they taped gauze down and then decided it didn't look right and peeled the tape away.  I should have just waxed, that's how most of it seemingly came off anyway.  Not fun.

Long story short, I've got a second degree burn.  They've given me a big tub of some cream called silver sulfadiazine to apply to the area during bandage changes and a prescription for antibiotics.  It should heal up in a few weeks with no permanent damage.

On another note, American Airlines was willing to adjust our flights due to the circumstances.  I'm not looking forward to being crammed into an airplane tomorrow.

tl;dr went to ER, had bad experience."
"TIFU by going to the emergency room.


So, after reading [this fuck up](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4um48z/tifu_by_faking_appendicitis_and_getting_my/) I knew I had to post mine. 

Back in March, I woke up on a beautiful Saturday morning to a terrible stomach ache. After a couple of hours, it was almost unbearable. I called the hospital and they told me since the pain seemed like appendicitis, I should treat it as an emergency and come in, so I did. 

I shouldn't have.

After being poked with IV's, having several blood tests done, a CT scan, and the rest of my day being spent in the hospital, the doctor came in with the results.

I had to poop. That was all. I've received over $7,000 in hospital bills because I had to take a shit. I could have easily bought a cheap over the counter medicine. I don't think I'm ever going to the hospital again.

TL;DR: Went to the hospital thinking I had appendicitis, just had to take a shit. I'm still getting hospital bills. "
"TIFU by shutting a door.


I was just fitting a door. I trimmed the door to size then chiselled out all the hinge rebates and fitted them, it swung really nicely and fitted perfectly.

So I moved on the the latch. Drilled a nice deep hole for it without going off line, chiselled out for the faceplate and screwed it all together.

Then I swung the door shut again to test it. Click! Perfect. All going well.

Now open the door again ready to put the knobs on. Oh.

How the hell do I get the latch to release when not only are there no knobs yet, there isn't even a hole in the door to get at the latch mechanism...

I think I'll just stay here for a while.

"Tifu by providing a spit sample


Obligatory this wasn't today. 

Posted a while ago but deleted instantly as per no posting bodily fluids during the weekdays rule. 

I'll keep it short without all the theatrics. 

Basically incredibly sick with a really high fever, my gp sends me to the hospital. Hospital decides to keep me overnight as my condition wasn't getting any better. I had been sleepless for a few nights and this night at hospital was no different, especially being checked on by nurses every hour. 

Morning comes and I finally manage to fall asleep, only to be awoken by yet another nurse I hadn't met before. I'm still in a drowsy haze and he hands me a small cup and says ""I need you to shit in this"" I think, huh? I respond ""can I do it later?"" thinking I don't need to make any bowel movements right now. He says that's fine and leaves. I fall back asleep. I have a great sleep and when I wake up I am reminded of the small cup on my bedside. I realise how ridiculous it is I need to provide a stool sample in something so small and how will I manage. 

I go over to the toilet and try for a very long time to push something out. Lucky for me I pop out the perfect sized little nugget and I catch it with the cup. I put the lid back on, wipe up and proudly go back to my bed and buzz the nurse over. Nurse takes the cup and leaves. Short whole later nurse comes running back into the room and is holding the cup up, shaking it going ""what is this? Is it your spit?"" I say ""umm, no it's my shit."" I start laughing uncontrollably realising I had misheard the request for a spit sample and thought he had asked for shit. He seemed amused but more embarrassed than me and explained how the people in the lab opened the cup and were wondering why my spit had solidified before they thought maybe it's something else. I was given a stool softener and discharged two days later, but oh boy everyone on the ward knew what had happened and I was incredibly embarrassed my entire stay. 

Tldr; nurse asks me for a spit sample,i misheard and tool it to the bathroom and provided a shit sample."
"TIFU by opening the freezer door


So as promised, the freezer story.

 So back in 2009 I left high school and had the summer before heading off to Uni. Since the majority of my friends were going to scatter across the globe come September we decide on a group holiday to one of the Canary Islands.

Holiday is going well with no major incidents. I did get dunked once in the pool; panicked, could not find up and propelled head first into the floor of the pool. You know standard stuff. At some point about three days before we were to fly home most of us were running low on funds, so we bought a bunch of foodstuff to cook for ourselves instead of eating out. Now the fridge/freezer combo in the villa had the larger fridge section at the bottom and a smaller freezer area above. Since 10 of us were trying to cook at once both the fridge and freezer sections were constantly being opened and closed. 

Have you ever left a freezer opened for an extended period of time, closed it, then tried to reopen it? Yeah, the jaws of life struggle. So I go to open the freezer and it’s had enough of being opened and closed, it’s tired, it’s grumpy and it’s fucking staging a sit in. Negotiations broke down fairly quickly, as the freezer already had hostages. I, with my false sense of bravado decided, the fuck am I being beaten by a freezer door (spoiler alert; I was beaten by a freezer door). So I braced my foot against the fridge door and hulked out on the freezer door. The door, not expecting a full frontal assault by a wannabe member of the Avengers, opened.

 I was not prepared for this.

 As a result, the freezer door swiftly punishes me with a jab to the face. I dropped like a sack of spuds. Luckily or unluckily, it walloped me in the forehead and the bridge of my nose at an angle so I didn’t actually break my nose. Though it bloody felt like it. A few hours later I look like a cross between a demented panda and cat women. Both my nose and forehead felt like the nerve ending were re-enacting the entire skirmish, and the swelling meant my eye was being swallowed by my face. So two of the guys decided that the hospital was the next tourist attraction on my list and off we went. Explaining to the doctor was fine, though he was confused at first, until one of the guys with me mimed the saga out on a medicine cupboard. Then it was just bloody hilarious. I think the nurse thought the bigger of the two guys with me had hit me. Doctor gave me care instructions and a bottle of pain killers. Though hindsight suggests they were not painkillers. We called a taxi and I popped two of the pills and got in the car.

 Guys I don’t know what those pills were, but I don’t remember anything after taking them. Nothing. Apparently I was screech/singing the opening lines of The Lion King in the backseat of the taxi. For the whole 40min return trip. I was also told I made a beeline for the pool claiming “It’s ok, I’m half panda now. I can breathe underwater”. I took all the books off the bookshelf and hid them in everyone’s pillow cases, I also hid beneath one guy’s bed. There is also video (that will never see the light of day so don’t ask) of me slow dancing with a deck chair while screeching The Righteous Brothers, Unchained Melody. I don’t remember a damn thing; all I know is I woke up the next morning on my bed, fully clothed, without shoes and little daisy like flowers had been place between my toes. 

**TL, DR: Lost a fight with a freezer door resulting in a hospital visit and a prescription resulting in memory loss.** 

&amp;nbsp;


**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned how quickly I went from taking the pills to Disney show tunes. All I can say is that everything I wrote about after getting in the taxi is second hand, my friends told me what I’d done, though there was some video. For all I know I was perfectly fine for the first 20mins of that taxi ride before things got Disney and they just said “yeah, you were doing xyz for the whole ride”. I basically just told you what they told me. I hope this clears things up for some people.
A big thank you goes out to /u/DanRowan, who took the time to edit my spelling and grammar. Also a big thank you goes out to whoever gilded this post. 


 **Video**. I will definitely not be posting the video. Right now I feel safe knowing I am faceless and nameless, no one could pick me out of a crowd, which is especially comforting after receiving some rather mean PMs. If I post that video, the feeling goes away. There is also the fact that it contains rather a lot of identifying material and I don’t have permission to post it from the other people in it.
I’ve had more than a few nasty PMs regarding my writing abilities, which to be honest has shredded my confidence. I am not a writer; my job field is not even close to anything resembling creative or comic writing. This started out as sharing a few funny experiences with the world and has just rapidly descended into a shit show. It isn’t fun anymore and I now feel a little uneasy checking my messages on Reddit. I agree, is entirely my fault, both for posting grammar and spelling mistakes and for letting things get to me. So, no more stories for a while, I’m going to take a break from posting.

"TIFU by doing the splits


This happened yesterday. I had gotten prescribed a muscle relaxant called ""Baclofen"" as a result of a recent car accident. I took some yesterday. I was at the park and had been sitting down for a while so I decided to do some stretches. To my amazement, I could reach my entire hand around the bottoms of my feet- usually I can barely only touch my toes. It also felt really good to stretch. I started stretching out in various different ways. 

At one point I had one leg stretched straight out to the side and I was reaching over with my hand- basically a ""one leg split"". I got he bright idea to see how it would be to just go ahead and put the other leg out. I did. To my amazement, I could stretch down within maybe 3 inches of the ground. I was practically doing the splits!

Hours later it became apparent that I had made a huge mistake. My legs were feeling wrong. 

Turns out I pulled the muscles on the insides of my thighs in a pretty bad way and now it hurts to walk. I just couldn't tell that my muscles aren't ""actually"" that stretchy while on the Baclofen. 

FML. 

Edit: Update: 

By fortunate coincidence I happened to have 3 days off work in a row, which practically never happens. The incident happened in the morning of the first day. So I've been able to stay off of my feet since this happened. My legs are feeling 75% better now, about 48 hours after the incident. I have work tomorrow, I'm hoping I have fully recovered by then. "
"TIFU By Getting Stuck In a Forest Fire


EDIT: Here is the only picture I took of the fire: http://imgur.com/a/UliTP
EDIT 2: Called insurance company. Seems like a normal claim thus far :-/
EDIT 3: Thanks for the Gold!! This is my first time on reddit. I've seen this mysterious gold before. I am going to have to figure this whole biome out. 


Long time lurker. I made this account to post my experiences yesterday. I am so sore all over. 

TL;DR: I got stuck in a forest fire, they hoisted me out with a helicopter. It was my fault. It sucked. Good people helped me. I am okay! 

Okay, so I've rested a tiny bit. I am a little scraped and bruised, but no major injuries. On Saturday, I went hiking in the Los Angeles Forest area to get some exercise and take some pictures. I did a basic map recon before, and found an easy trail right off the highway with a good vantage point. Sunsets are great in the area because of the LA smog and a there also happened to be a small fire in the area, which added a bit of smoke. The fire was small in the day on Saturday, around 3-4k acres. I checked the news prior to departure, saw the fire, looked at basic fire trends and determined that it was small and I was far enough away.

The trail I selected was off of a major highway, and the vantage point I selected was about 5 miles off the highway on a dirt road. The dirt road wasn't bad, by any means, but it had a highly raised dirt/sand shoulder. I could not see the fire from where I was, and the wind was not pushing it in my direction. 

After sunset, I could see the fire in the distance. It was pretty far away, and wasn't fast moving, but one thing I noticed was the insane size of it. It was surreal, armeggedon like. I could only see tiny peaks of flame a few hills over, but the entire horizon was bright orange. At that point, I decided it was time to leave. I was also far enough away that I assessed that the fire was about four hours from me, at the rate it was moving and growing. I decided to snap one last picture and leave.

When I got in the car to leave, I did a quick accountability of all my stuff--camera, phone, wallet, etc. I quickly discovered that I didn't have my wallet. I looked around the car for a few minutes and couldn't find it. Generally, I would have left the wallet and gone home (I have a passport and can easily replace cards), but I didn't have enough gas to get all the way home. I looked at the fire, and the wind was changing direction--my direction. The change in wind direction began pushing smoke, intensely, in my direction, but the speed of the fire remain unchanged. I spent the next hour and change looking for my wallet. 

I decided to stop looking for the wallet when I heard two firefighters yelling in the distance, ""Hey, get your masks on!"" I said ""screw this,"" and figured I could beg for the money at a gas station or just sleep on the shoulder until I figured it out. By this point, I was slightly anxious and trying to beat feet out of there as quickly as I could. I was going too fast on the dirt road. I should have never looked for my wallet; I would have been home by then if I hadn't. The density of the smoke turned everything black--It looked like a steady snow. The visibility, combined with my haste, and ABS got me stuck on the sandy shoulder. It wasn't a bad stuck, and there was no damage to the car, but I was stuck in the sand, and there was this protruding, strong root(s) in the sand.

I jump out of the car, assess the situation and think, ""Okay, thats not bad at all. No damage, just stuck in the sand. I can do this."" I get sticks, logs, the car jack, whatever I can find. I start digging the car out, and the sand is easy to work with, but the roots make it much more difficult. After working with it for about an hour, I swallow my pride and call 911. This is where things start getting really bad. By this point, in the span of hours, the fire has gone from a few thousand acres to over 20,000 acres, and when I call 911, there is clearly a ton of interagency confuesion. 

I explain the situation to 911, they transfer to CHP, who tells me to call a tow truck. I explain the situation further and she tells me they will send a unit. In the meantime, I keep digging--keep trying to get the car out of the sand. It is getting hot at this point, and all I can hear is this intense roaring howl interspersed with violent crackling. I can now very clearly see the fire, but they aren't flames--it's just a giant wall of orange with sinister looking tornadoes and sparks. I call 911 again, and there is a lot of confusion on my location. They can't find me. I try to give them my exact coordinates, but you can't use your phone in 911 mode, so after a terrible back and fourth that took another 20 minutes, they have my lat/long. 

The fire is here now. I am screaming help while I dig. I call 911 again. They tell me to leave the vehicle and run, and I ask for a distance and direction, and they just tell me to ""make all considerations for personal safety."" I was exhausted; it was hot; I couldn't breathe. I get in the car, and just lay down. I drop a pin on facebook for my location and post, ""I am stuck in the Santa Clarita fire."" I pray and relax. I am about 5.5 miles from the highway. I might be able to make it on foot and beat the fire, but thats a road to lose. There was a strange calm at that point.

I call 911 again and get a better operator and she connects me to LAFD finally. They said wouldn't be able to get anyone to my location to help me, so they were going to attempt to mount a ""hoist rescue operation."" They instructed me to wait for the helicopter. I hear the helicopter approach, and at this point I am on the line with LAFD Air Night Ops. Apparently, they have to drop water on the fire around me to be able to mount the rescue. I hear the helo leave after dropping the water, and that was a really tough sound to hear, the sound of a helicopter leaving when there is danger. 

The LAFD explains that they are going to drop a firefighter in to my area and then hoist me out of the fire. I am so grateful, but so embarassed at the same time. They tell me that they are going to drop me eyepro, which thankfully I had, (Oakleys are not douchey!). As they are hoisting the firefighter in, the rotor wash was like none I have experienced before. Every inch of exposed skin felt like it was in a media blasting room, but it was a welcome feeling. The firefighter was hoisted down, after which the helo departed. He put me in the harness, checked my health and then called the helo back. 

We hooked onto the rope and the helocopter took off. It was pretty surreal at that point. It was a beautiful and frightening sight, the massive fire below, as I dangled from a rope, attached to a helocopter, with a stranger. I was hugely embarassed. This was all my fault. After we got enough elevation, they hoisted the rope up and pulled us in. That ride felt like it went on forever. I was thirsty, tired, covered in bruises and scratches. I actually wondered if this was just some sort lucid dream or


They dropped me off at a local ranch and said the Sheriff would meet me in about 20 minutes. Things got very confusing. I was dropped in a pretty remote location, and because of internal confusion, they Sheriff couldn't find me. I called 911 every hour after, each time explaining where I was, but the LASD had trouble believing that the LAFD dropped me in such a remote location, and each time they drove by me, it was at like 100mph and they were at code, and I kept trying to wave them down. After numerous calls to 911 and some sleep on the dirt, I manage to flag down a police car. They get on the radio and yell ""We found him!"" Several LE agencies were looking for me--they just couldn't believe the fire department dropped me in such a remote area. 

At about 4am(ish), I get to the Sheriffs department. Thus begins the saga of getting home. I am home now. Everything is sore. Thank you LAFD. "
