"TIFU By Bringing A Magnet To School


I'm a high school senior.
I'm what you would call a mischievous student.
I bought a magnet.
It's a pretty big magnet.
Pretty cool looking magnet.
Pretty fucking strong magnet.
I brought said magnet to school.
I showed all my friends.
Wed a little ""Test Your Strength"" booth that the security guards took part in.
Point was to take it off a locker.
Fun stuff.
I had the magnet in my hand.
I should've had it in the cardboard protective wrap.
I walked into English Class and went straight to my teacher's desk to ask a question.
I forgot I was holding said magnet.
Said magnet jumps out of my hand and attaches to the drawer.
All metal in the drawer jumped to where the magnet was stuck.
There were CDs in the drawer.
The stuff that flew must've scratched and cracked some CDs.
CDs were unreadable.
I was laughing too hard to take it off the desk.
The substitute teacher was too weak to pry it off.
He called maintenance to remove the magnet.
Then security to remove me.
I now have a Saturday School Detention and am facing a suspension for ""destruction of property.""
I feel bad so I'll replace the CDs.

TL;DR: Don't bring a magnet to school.

"TIFU by losing everything I own to a pigeon...


Throw away because my friends know my main account. I'm sure they'll hear about this at some point, but right now I really don't want to deal with being the butt of their jokes.

Anyway, I'm moving countries and have been selling my stuff in this last week. Today I sold the final item on our list of things to sell (apart from the car), to someone and offered to drive it to them because they couldn't fit it in their own. 

I get paid and put the cash in my wallet with the rest of the cash from literally everything else we sold and headed home. 

On my way back, there was a car stopped in the middle of a 2 lane/2 way road with a lady running around around her car, throwing her hands up in the air and looking quite helpless. I stick my head out the window and asked if she needed any help and it turns out that there's an injured pigeon on the road and she was trying to catch it to get it out of harms way. 

I get out and chase the pigeon, caught the little guy, and walked him out to a little area where I knew he'd be safe and went back on my way. 

When I got home, I realize that my wallet wasn't in my pocket. No Biggie, I must have left it in the car. 

Nope. 

I'm not really sure what happened, but I'm guessing I must have left the thing on my lap or something, got out and lost it there, but I could not find it when I went back. Nearly $6,700 down the drain. 

Maybe my fuck up was waiting until I sold everything before I put it into my bank account, or not just putting it in a fucking sock or something. Either way, I basically lost the earnings for everything I owned to this goddamn pigeon.

I hope that pigeon lives to be fat and plump because if I hear that a cat got him, it would have all been for nothing.

**TLDR: I sold everything in my house and got absolutely nothing for it because I lost my wallet whilst rescuing a fucking pigeon** 

*EDIT: Woah. I never thought this would get so much attention. I really appreciate all the love and all the lovely messages you've sent me. I also wholeheartedly agree with everyone pointing out how much of an idiot I was for keeping so much money with me in person (this is why I'm here on this sub). I fucked up big time.* 

*I spoke to my wife about it, and she's an absolute legend. I know she was upset, but she never overtly showed it and just told me that it will be alright and we'll get through it. I'm so lucky to have someone awesome like her in my life. I was panicking about this, but she's amazing. I think I owe her a big holiday sometime.* 

*Also, to those of you suggesting the gofundme thing, that's awfully generous of you. It's really cool to see people band together to do shit like that. There's a lot of stuff happening in the world right now gives me a bleak glimpse of what humanity has come to nowadays, but it's people like you who glimmer like diamonds in the dirt. You're awesome.* 

*I know it's a lot of money, but I've always strongly believed in facing the consequences of your actions (or inaction in this case), learning from it and moving on. The help is greatly appreciated, but it just doesn't sit right with me to have strangers fund a totally avoidable situation. I fucked up, and now I must deal with it. I'm also not completely broke or anything like that. We could've made it through fine without the money from our old stuff, but it's just a shame to have lost it all - especially since we considered shipping some of the more expensive stuff. Gah!*

*Those of you asking me to check back where I lost it, I have! So have the police. I mentioned in a comment that they were pretty certain I would never get it back. Either someone's picked it up, or an animal's taken it. They will keep an eye out for it. Also, it's a lot a money! Of course I've also thoroughly checked my car, and I definitely had it on me because I put the money into my wallet just before I drove off. The only stop was the pigeon rescue.*

*The lady could've been a scam artist, but it just seemed quite unlikely for a few reasons; she was driving a fairly expensive car, she was with me the whole time, she drove off just in front of me and she was alone. Perhaps there was an accomplice involved, there's no ruling that out, but it just didn't seem likely. I think I just dropped the bloody thing under my car when I got out and didn't see it when I got back to my car. I even vaguely recall seeing something in my rearview mirror as I drove away, but at this point I don't even know if that's just my mind making it up or something.* 

*Also, those of you wanting us to run over the pigeon - shame! That's terrible! I would've taken it home if I wasn't moving. I actually have no regrets saving the thing. I just wish I was more careful with our cash, or less lazy and less stupid. Lesson learned I guess.* 

*Thanks for all the e-hugs. You guys rule :)*

*Edit 2: Oh yeah, for those of you wondering how I fit that much money in my wallet, I'm not from America nor do I live there. I only converted the amount to USD because there are more Americans on here than any other nationality (ans besides, most people can relate to USD). We have bigger amounts in notes where I live, but yeah my wallet was still pretty thick!* 

*Also, for some of you who think I'm trying to scam people into feeling bag for me and paying me, as I said earlier, I do not want your money, nor am I asking for help. I just wanted to share a fuck up just like everyone else on this sub.*

*Hope that covers all the FAQ's!*"
"TIFU by getting angry with a man pushing into the queue for the plane on the way back from deployment...


Obligatory happened a while ago... I am ex British Military, 845 squadron, Commando Helicopter Force to be precise. When I left the military civilian life didn't agree with me so I went into close protection specialising in hostile environment and anti terrorism. Working primarily in the Middle East, after one long deployment we were coming home through Sri Lanka. Unlike the British who everyone knows we just love to queue and play by the rules, people in that part of the world don't share the same ideals.

So me and my team are queuing to go through security and a Sri Lankan guy tried to push in smashing my trolley out of the way, I say ""ow pal, get to the back of the queue!"" He then looks annoyed but ultimately does as I ask. We next get through security and get to passport control, again the same issue! I politely remind the men that there is a queue system and point to the back, they join the back of the queue whilst giving me the evils.

Then my finest moment, bare in mind I have been deployed for two months away from home and fed next to nothing and lived in horrendous conditions, I'm tired and hungry, desperate to get home and fed up of the lack of respect for other people displayed in this part of the world. We are queueing for the plane now and a guy pushes past us followed by about ten kids going to the front of the queue... I lose my rag ""OW PAL! (He turns around and looks at me) Yeah you! There's a queue here get to the back of it for gods sake!"" 

The the children all turn round, they are all wearing sunglasses... strange? Then I notice them all with white sticks... oh dear... he was escorting ten blind children onto the plane and given priority. I immediately apologise and proceed to ensure roughly ten hours of piss taking and impressions and recounting of the tale in various ways all more embellished than the last to make it funnier by my team (as is per military tradition) the air hostesses who we normally end up getting friendly (in more ways than one) with wouldn't even talk to me or give me any refreshments. And to top it off I will probably burn in hell...

TL:DR got sick of people pushing in a queue and by the third time I told someone off for it realised he was escorting blind kids to the from of the queue

Edit - holy shit this blew up, just like to say thanks to Naz at the kebab stand! Without you my Saturdays would be meaningless, struggling to reply to a lot of the comments as I'm boring now with kids and chores but thank you for the kind comments I really appreciate it I hope you all have a lovely day

Edit 2 - I also don't feel bad about this just wanted to tell a funny story... prob not all that funny if you weren't there and if that's the case my apologies for wasting your day lol

Edit 3 - if you're anti military or just want to comment some bullshit propaganda you read in a magazine that all military lads/lasses are scum please do it elsewhere. I have limited tolerance and don't want to waste it on internet trolls today"

"TIFU by sending the Navy Seal copypasta over live chat to a company whilst at college.


Obligatory this didn't happen today.

So me and my classmates were often left on our own by our teacher. As you'd expect we got bored and being young we'd do the usual office chair jousting and what-not.

Well one day we're surfing the web looking for stupid websites to keep us amused and came across a horrendous yet glorious mess of a website for a car leasing company. I'm sure plenty can guess who it is; I'll leave that to you.

So we carry on perusing it until we spot that they have live chat... **bingo**.

Now we aren't taking this website seriously; we all thought that it's some kind of bot and fueled by our adolescent idiocy, decided to mess with it.

&gt;*THEM*: Hi I'm [insert name], how can I help?

&gt;*ME*: Hi I'm Mike Litoris, I'm looking to lease a car.

&gt;*THEM*: Sure Mike, anything in particular?

&gt;*ME*: Something with a big trunk.

&gt;*THEM*: Perhaps a SUV then?

&gt;*ME*: A pussy wagon?! Good thinking.

&gt;*THEM*: Ok, but please refrain not using language like that or I'll have to end the chat.

&gt;*ME*: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

*A couple of minute pass...*

&gt; *THEM*: We can see your IP and notice it belongs to [insert college name]. We will now forward this onto your college administration.

**fuck.**

**It wasn't a bot.**

Scramble ensues to clear browser history, pull out the network cable &amp; shut down the computer... *like it will make any difference.* We agree not to talk of it and hope they were just trying to scare us.

...

**About a week later**


We're sat in class, they were *obviously* bluffing: we all think it's blown over. 

The head of department, my tutor and college deputy walk in. Oh shit.

&gt;Deputy: (My name)? follow me.

I make the walk of shame to the Principal's office, then I'm sat down at a table with a load of people I've never seen before.

It turns out the company emailed the **entire** conversation directly to the Principal and it was forwarded onto every member of the college administration. The IT support team then looked through everyone's history to find out who visited the website and of course, I had.

I was in there for at least a couple of hours. The highlight being explaining what the Navy Seal copypasta is to the college principal and admin team.

Somehow, I wasn't suspended despite taking all the wrap but was watched constantly for the rest of my time at college and had to stay after college for a few weeks.

Still, it's safe to say, that was one of the dumbest things I ever did.

**TL;DR:** I sent the Navy Seal copypasta to a company over live chat at college and they sent the whole conversation to the principle and college admin team.

EDIT: To clarify i'm not in the US, so our definitions of principal and deputy aren't the same

EDIT 2: Whoa, this blew up while I was asleep.

EDIT 3: Cleaned up stuff that autocorrect changed to satisfy the grammar nazis."
"Tifu by going paintballing with out telling my wife.


So this happened around a month ago but we are still realising the enormity of this FU. 

This FU starts with me going on a business trip for a week a month ago. I had finished my work a day early and my flight couldn't be moved my boss said the I could use that day to do what I liked as I had work late into the night the past 3 days. So I looked on the website 'meetup' for things to do and found a group going paintballing. 😃 I join and have a brilliant 7 hours accumulating many bruises. 

After a 7 hour flight and an hour drive I get home late morning to find my wife getting ready to leave for a week due to a last minute conference. There was less than 15 mins between me getting home and her leaving so no time to really talk.

Now here's were the FU ramps up. 

On the day that my wife is due home I go for a morning run what I didn't know was my wife had returned home seconds after I had left and had seen me leaving. Half way round I started to feel bad but tried to push through the pain. Moments later I fainted and hit the ground. My wife who knew my route had thrown on some slacks and followed me only see me on the ground. An ambulance was called and off to hospital we went.

After an initial assessment they asked my wife what all the bruising was from and she had no clue. Apparently this is a red flag for domestic abuse. It took two hours until I was coherent enough for me to clarify that I went paintballing all the while my wife was being asked by many people why i was bruised. My wife and the nurse was suprised by my statement and I don't think the nurse believed me. 

After 40 hours in hospital I was released and home we went. Two days later we had a PCSO vist because of loud shouting in our apartment building. And finally this morning we woke to find our apartment had been broken into and trashed. We have just moved and had nothing value outside our bedroom how we didn't hear them we don't know. The problem is that when we called the police they split me and my wife and interrogated us. Asking me questions about our relationship. 

After all these encounters we think that the powers that be think my wife beats me. 

Tldr:- went paintballing didn't tell wife series of events and now people think my wife beats me."

"TIFU by attempting to be a ninja and destroying my lymphatic system


This one takes me back, probably the stupidest decision of my life. I was just a little kid back then, in the suburbs of Houston, Texas. I had a pretty vivid imagination and I was always role playing about being a ""soldier"" or a ""warrior"" or whatever. So this particular day, I was just playing in the back yard, pretending to be a ninja. Coincidentally at the same time frame, I had begun taking Kung fu lessons at a Chinese community center. (As a clumsy white kid, I was the laughing stock of the operation XD) I saw this nice firm shoot of bamboo in my yard and decided to wield it as my weapon, figuring with my martial arts, I would do something epic. I proceeded to sprint at the garage wall, in a attempt to pole vault up the side with my flimsy piece of bamboo. (Thinking back it really didn't make any logical sense) Instead, as I ran, I fell over a rock with the bamboo still in my grasp, and borderline skewered myself in the thigh with the bamboo shoot, now splintering and a couple inches deep through my skin. Blood immediately covered the area and I could feel the wood inside of my laceration. In all my pain, I was dizzy and disoriented removing the splinters from my thigh.
I could have never known that the damage would be much deeper. 

Over the course of a week my leg began to swell to twice its size. It was like nothing we had ever seen. The skin became soft and malleable, almost like a memory foam mattress. You could leave faint white streaks on my leg by simply touching and dragging a finger across. On top of this it was heavy, uncomfortable, and an embarrassment to have. After speaking to several specialists, my condition was identified as Lymphadema: A condition in which the lymphatic system fails to move fluid waste back into the bloodstream. I received that injury ten years ago, and must manage it through stockings worn daily, garments worn every night, and additional measures

TL;DR Pretended to be a ninja as a kid, found bamboo stick, impaled myself in thigh, suffered a permanent condition.

"TIFU by smoking weed at a police station


I'm telling this story because 4/20. It actually happened 13 years ago.

I was in college, a few buddies and me went to go watch Shrek 2 in the local theater.  Beforehand, we decided to find a secluded place to toke up.  It was late on a Saturday and we found what appeared to be an abandoned building.  We pulled around back, packed a bowl in our trusty piece ""Reese"", and started smoking.  As the pipe made its third round, we saw a car driving up behind us.  We all slunk back in our seats to avoid being seen.  The car parked right next to us; it was a police car.  We were totally silent.  We saw two cops get out, talk for a minute and then walk away.  We laughed at our bad luck and then got ready to leave.  Just then, another police car pulled up on the other side of our car and two more officers got out.  When they were out of view, we left as quickly as we could.  As we pulled out, sure enough, we dumbasses had just lit up behind a goddamn police station.  We took a picture of ourselves with pipe in hand and the police station in the background and sent it to a couple friends to boast of our accomplishment.

We went, saw Shrek 2, laughed our asses off, then went back to the dorms at our college.  When we got there, our dean had somehow intercepted the picture of us smoking.  We got suspended, but it was much better than being arrested.

Anyway, enjoy 420!  Be smarter than me, smoke anywhere but a police station.

tl;dr me and my buddies got high at a police station; got suspended from school because we boasted about it.

edit to answer a few recurring questions: we're not 100% sure how the Dean got the picture, we think someone uploaded it to our school's student network and some third party brought it to the Dean's attention.  No, he doesn't look like the Dean from Community, he looks more like Dennis Haysbert.  Yes, my school suspended me for something that petty.  It's a small, religious college (2,000 people) and it suspended people even for legal activities, like smoking cigarettes or consensual sex.  Also, Shrek 2 is underrated, get high and watch it this weekend.

second edit: thanks for the gold, **FUCK DONALD TRUMP**"
"TIFU by trying to walk on a numb foot


Scenario: I wake up with 30 mins till I have to leave for work. I can't feel or move my left foot. It is completely limp. Well, I have to get ready for work and I don't have time to wait for feeling to come back. Barely conscious me thinks, ""No problem! It will be like walking on a peg leg. Feeling will come back while I get ready.""


I stand up.


That lasts for half a second as my ankle rolls and I fall to the ground. Hard.


Shit.


I pick myself up off the ground along with my shattered dignity. I hold my left leg in my hands and shake it until feeling returns. Too bad that with feeling comes an incredible amount of pain from my newly sprained foot.


Double shit.


I limp around the house, taking twice as usual. I end up being late for work and missed an interview for a supervisor position. Basically fucked up my entire day and my foot.


TL;DR Thought a limp foot would work like a peg leg, sprained it and missed a job interview."
"TIFU by trying to clean a lamp


This didn't happen today but happened when I was 9 years old. My dad is a neat freak so as a child I picked up the habit (Which I grew out of). When anything was a bit dirty in my room, I cleaned it up. So one day, as any 9yo does, I'm at my tiny desk coloring, and I notice there's dust on the lightbulb (which is very much on). So I rush into the bathroom, get some toilet paper and wet it in the bathroom sink. I rush back in to my room, and try to clean the lamp. As I put the wet toilet paper on the lightbulb, it explodes, with the glass that broke, leaving cuts on my hand in a couple of places. So I'm sitting there crying and my mother hears me from her room. She comes in, and sees my hand bleeding. As she's panicking, she asks me what happened. I told her, and her panic turned into laughter, at how stupid her son is. Because everyone knows that water and electricity don't go well together. The cuts were nothing a band aid can't cover.

TL;DR: tried to clean a lightbulb with wet toilet paper, which ended up exploding and making my hand bleed.

Edit: Grammar mistakes.

Edit2: as a lot of people pointed out it was the water with hot bulb that caused the ""explosion"", so I feel stupid. Can someone scientifically explain why that happens, please?

Edit3: also lots of you expected to see a genie in this story, I'm sorry that isn't the case. Maybe in my next TIFU? Haha

Edit4: so many similar stories! Glad I wasn't the only one! And lots of people have answered 'Edit2' in the comments so thank you!"
"TIFU by breaking into a Policeman's house


I do confess this was last week but the consequences are still going. So long story short, I'm dating a policeman's daughter. Last week I decided to try and be cute for my girlfriend and make a sticky note love heart with different things I love about her on each note. So I went over to her and her dads house (I am still in school so she lives with her dad) equipped with sticky notes and a pen. I went to find the spare key but had no luck so decided to try the window which opened first try. The window was a few metres up so had to get a bench to climb up there. So I'd made it inside and then made the cheesy sticky note loveheart on her bedroom wall. Then me being the forgetful vegetable I am forgets to close the window that I climbed through along with leaving muddy footprints everywhere. Two days had passed now and no one had been home as they were away. So I see my girlfriend on the bus in the morning and she tells me there was a break-in at her house and her dad was fingerprinting the place. She tells me that her dad arrived home to find the window open and footprints over the carpet. I freak out at this point so I then call him to tell him my screw-up and explain what I did and he tells me the inspectors are at the house taking fingerprints. At this point I thought I was going to jail but he was sympathetic and said I had good intentions and since he liked me he'll just see it as funny and a screw-up. So a few days pass over the weekend without hearing from my girlfriend and I message  her to ask if she was still mad at me. She says she isn't mad but her dad does think of me differently. I reply ""how so?"" Then I get the message ""well he thinks of you as my weird and ex boyfriend now."" I reply ""oh, do you think the same?"" Still uneasy with girlfriend not sure if she will break up with me or not. 

TLDR: broke into girlfriends house trying to be cute, dad policeman, sees someone left window open, starts investigation for break in, I tell him it was me, now girlfriend sees me differently.
