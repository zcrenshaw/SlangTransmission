"TIFU by not testing the stability of a grappling hook bought off amazon.


I tried to climb an abandoned factory at night across from my house. The grappling hook seemed to be fairly secure, and I started climbing up the rope thinking I'm spiderman. I am not spiderman. The whole thing falls apart when I'm about 15 ft up, I fall and sprain both my knees, cut up my arm and break my clavicle. I also needed a tetanus shot.

**Tl;dr** it's literally 5 sentences just read it

Now I don't have pictures of the actual X-ray, but I have the also much requested pictures of some of the injuries. The only proof I have of the knees are the braces which aren't that exciting.

And uh, here's a shameless plug of me doing the salmon ladder to show, uh, if I were to have a higher quality grappling hook it'd be possible. You know, if I wasn't a flaming idiot.

"TIFU by peeing outside in Thailand


This just happened a few minutes ago and my legs should be renamed Pompei.

Im visiting Northern Thailand, and my resort courtesy shuttle driver had to pee, so he pulled over, and since I needed to go too, i got out as well.  Thats where it all went wrong.  

The driver pulled over near a canal, and i jump out of the van and go down to the waters edge thinking I would be out of oncoming drivers eyes and turn my body so the driver cant see me either, since hes doing his thing about 15 feet from me. I pull out Lil' Wang and start to flow...it was glorious...then I feel some movement on the hairs of my legs, so i look down expecting to see mosquitoes....nope.  I had just waddled into the largest ant colony I had ever seen.  Within the maybe 5 seconds I had been standing there, these fucking monsterous fire breathers had already covered my legs to the point i could barely see my ankles.

I immediately start to jump up and down on alternating legs while I'm swatting at both ants and mosquitoes with my one free hand. I eventually let go of my dignity and use both hands to scrape the layers of biting ants off my legs while unsuccessfully ceasing the golden flow.  The van driver is laughing his ass off as im hopping up and down and halfassed running up the hill without pulling up my pants screaming ""oww oww oww ants fucking ants!!""  

To add insult to injury, my lovely fiancee is in the van scolding me from afar telling me i should have known better and that i shouldn't be waving that thing everywhere.  

Im back in the van now, covered in my own urine, and my legs are on fire.  Every few seconds it feels like im being bitten again randomly on my feet.

TLDR: jumped out of a van to pee, stood in a fire ant nest and gave myself a golden shower...

Edit: Wow this blew up...front page even.  Thank you Reddit for the love."
"TIFU by dating a girl without knowing her name


I'll try to keep this short as possible, and maybe sorry for bad english.

That story happened 3 years ago. I was leaving a restaurant when I saw one girl in the street, she looked at me and I thought ""Well, I think I know her, I think I 'dated' her when I was very young (twelve years young, just holding hands and kid's stuff, I have 25 by now)"". So the girl comes at me and say:


Girl: Hi Diego! Long time no see.

Me: Hi! *Wtf, I don't remember her name*


So we chatted a little, remembering the old times at school and she said we should hang out someday. I thought why not, she was very pretty and could be fun, but she asked me to add her in the facebook, but I didn't remember her name, so I said:


Me: Oh, sure, how can I find you on Facebook?

Girl: Just search for my name, I think we have a lot of friends in common, it will be easy.


And thats I how I fucked up. I didn't want to ask her name, would be awkward because she remembered mine. So I asked for her phone, she gave the number to me and a I put on my cellphone as ""Girl I dated""

Ok, a week pass by, my friends wants to call her to know her name but I refuse, I had a plan and a backup plan, it would be easy. I call her, and the conversation goes like this:


Girl: Hello?

Me: Hi, who is this? (my plan! She will say her name and it will be ok)

Girl:... Diego?

Me: Hi!! Yes, how are you? (Ok, I fucked up)


So, she didn't say her name, but we chatted a little on the phone and I asked her out on a date. The date is set. We will see Iron Man 3 in the movie theater in the next day. Ok, my friends still wanting to call her, but I had another plan, we will see a movie, so when we get to the movie theater and we buy tickets she will probably have a Student ID (Idk if there is something like that in other countries, but college studants pay half the price in concerts and movie theaters in Brazil) and I will joke about her photo in the Student ID and see her name, easy peasy (I realize now that was stupid). 

So, we are on the movie theater ready to buy the tickets and I she didn't have student ID because she already have a degree, I fucked up again. I didn't knew her name yet but we went to see the movie. In the middle of the movie we start making out and things start to get hard, so we decided to leave and we went to my car.

I parked my car in a dark place and we start to make out and goes on and on and we had sex. It was very nice. After that she cuddles with me and we keep like that for a while. So, just to remember, I didn't talk with her so much, we just talk about us as kids, I knew nothing about her.

After a while she asked me why I didn't add her on facebook. Men... I froze. I start to panicking but I said that I didn't find her on Facebook, and the conversation goes like this:


Girl: You didn't found me? What you searched for?

Me: Well, I searched for your name, but I didn't found you.


She looked at me, her face turned into a very serious face. She asked me ""What is my name Diego?"". I almost shitted my pants, I didn't know what to do. Do I say the truth, that I really liked her and didn't want to be awkward and say that I forgot her name? Or I try to guess her name? (I really tought that her name was Bruna, but I tried to search on facebook and never found). I went with the truth. I said that I was ashame that I didn't remember her name, but I really liked the time we spent together, and she was nice and I keep going saying that stuff.

She obviously got mad and start yelling at me and saying a lot of stuff, calling me names. She asked me to take her to her home, and so I did. I stopped in the front of her house, and before she left I hold her arm and said: Please, Im sorry, what is your name?
She was very angry, she take of my arm from her, leave the car and says:


Fuck you.


And she leaves. Yes Reddit, Im very stupid. I was very upset for a few days, but after that I really laughed with that story.

TL;DR
Dated I girl that I knew when I was a kid, she remembers my name and I didn't remember hers. We had sex, she realizes that I don't remember her name and gets very angry. I dropped her at her house, ask her name and she says: Fuck you.


Edit: Guys, I didn't knew about the number-facebook thing, it was 3 years ago, and we didn't have whatsapp at that time.

"TIFU by switching seats on an airplane


Happened today, roughly 40 mins ago. Posting from the plane. 

 I am sitting in the aisle seat. 

Just got my drink from the flight attendant. They roll off to the next section. 

Lady in the other aisle seat, single mom, infant child. 

Has been talking about how hard this traveling is to see the father Etc etc etc...

She opens the child's bottle.

That was packaged on the ground. 

We are at 30,000 or more. 

It is pressurized. 

It leaps out, in an warm spray. 

Like the first gallon of water from a garden hose in the middle of the summer. 

Ankle, hip, elbow, drink, shoulder, ear canal, and hair. 

Drenched in warm milk. 

WARM... MILK... 

As my brain processes this the lady looks horrified. 

She immediately starts apologizing and producing napkins and baby wipes to assist in drying and sanitizing my self. 

All I could muster is ""don't worry about it""  

I knew that all I could do at this point is make her feel worse. But that wouldn't make me feel better or change my situation. 

I just have to ask her though. 

""Is that breast milk?""

Sheepishly she confirmed my worry. 

I have to follow up that awkward question with an important, personal medical question... ""Any thing I need to worry about? STDs, etc...""

She assures me that she is perfectly healthy and still so very sorry. Offers to buy me a shot on the plane. 

I tell her to please continue to not worry about it. I travel a lot. So much so that my favorite flights are the ones I can't remember. 

That this flight however. I will remember forever. 

I am dried off now. 

The flight attendant replaced my drink. 

The baby is fed and asleep. 

I am laughing about it in my head because, this isn't my assigned seat. I switched with a young lady that wanted to sit with her wife. 

Which reminds me, no good deed goes unpunished. 

**TL;DR:** switching seats to help a married-couple^lesbians sit next to each other put me in the firing line of roughly half a baby bottle of recently harvested female breast milk, which i briefly thought could make me patient zero for ghona-sypha-herpa-aids.

**EDIT**

clearing up frequently asked questions.

**bottle pressure:**
the altitude at DFW airport is 607 feet. The altitude a cabin is pressurized to is 8000 feet. the pressure is sealed in the bottle, and escapes rapidly into the low pressure around it, hence spraying all over me. *This experiment covers the basics of how this happened* http://www.physicscentral.com/experiment/physicsathome/physicsonplane.cfm 

**STDs how stupid are you!?!?!?:**
Today I Learned... CDC says its fine for Hep B and Hep C moms to breast feed. Transmission is less than 1%-2% and the nipples have to be cracked and bleeding http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/hepatitis.htm

**what did it taste like**
I didn't get any in my mouth, it was just so shocking. not that there is anything wrong with breastmilk and if my wife and i have kids, i'll probably try it in a controlled environment. 

**Was she Cambodian:**
you're funny and you should go into comedy.

**was she hot**
I honestly couldn't tell you, I didn't notice her before the incident, and could look her in the eye after the incident. I'm happily married and just don't care what other women look like."
"TIFU by slamming my daughter down onto the ground.


I enrolled my kids in karate class about a month ago. Since I had to stay there with them while they practiced, I figured that I might as well sign up too. That way we can practice together at home and I can keep them motivated by being in class with them. 

Last night at class we were practicing a move that we learned not too long ago. Our teacher paired me up with my daughter to practice the move together. I pretty much have the move down, so I went through it pretty fast. Unfortunately when it came to the throwing part, I didn't hold her up high enough during the fall, so I ended up throwing her down for real. 

Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing and looked at me in shock. Of course I was apologizing to my daughter and making sure that she was ok. But our teacher was not happy about it at all. She...corrected me and basically told me not to let it happen again.

My daughter is ok, but a little bit sore. I feel like a total piece of shit about it. And nobody is letting me live it down either."
"TIFU by kissing the wrong girl in front of my girlfriend.


I've been dating my girlfriend for a couple of weeks now and for the first time we were both off work on the same day, so we decided to make a day out of it and spend some time together. Her parents are abroad for holidays, her sister is at work and her brother is with his friends, so she was home alone, bored and wanted to hang out, go for a run, get some food.. You know, just have a day out together like any normal couple would. So when I arrive at her house, I see her walking across the driveway towards her garage.. She hasn't spotted me yet, so I decide to sneak up behind her. I get close, and then in a _borderline rapey sneak attack,_ I just quickly grab her by the shoulders, turn her around and kiss her. After I pull away she's got a shocked look on her face, (obviously I've just nailed it and she wasn't expecting it at all.) 

""Umm.. What the fuck?""

""Oh shit."" (I haven't nailed it all, she didn't like this)

I then hear the hysterical laughter coming from behind me as I turn around and see my girlfriend laughing really fucking hard because she just witnessed me kiss her identical twin sister, who was just at home for her lunch break. I'm trying to keep it together and explain my fuck up to her and it was an honest mistake, but she just continues to laugh and eventually told me that she opened the door to greet me, but when she saw me walking behind her sister in the opposite direction, she decided that it would be hilarious to see how it panned out.

Luckily she got a laugh out of it and nothing bad happened, we're still together. But in that moment I instantly thought that the relationship was done for. 

Moral of the story; If your significant other has an identical twin, never try to surprise them.. Probably better off ~~murdering them~~ making sure they're not around, first."
"TIFU By wasting 16 years of my life by cheating in school by being misdiagnosed with ADHD.


For as long as I can remember, when I was 8 years old I've had horrible issues with sleep in general. I was *always* tired during the day and evening no matter what was done. I could sleep 6 hours or 12, absolutely no difference.

At the time, none of my doctors could figure out what was wrong with me. They had assumed because I wasn't fat, and I was so young that it simply was ADHD. So I was given Adderall to mask the symptoms of sleep, which did help. 

I don't know if you guys know what massive sleep deprivation does, but imagine having no sex drive and being tired all the time. Anytime you try to study, you get unbearable sleep attacks that even if you did fight it, it was moot because you literally forgot what you just read.

My sleep deprivation was so bad, I had to constantly rock my head against the desk just to stay awake. My teachers were always frustrated with this, and would frequently think I was sleeping and ask me questions. Amazingly enough, I was able to answer these questions and not get in trouble.

Eventually, my parents got scared that I wasn't getting proper education and took me into home schooling. This was literally the worst decision in my life to agree to. They were unbearably strict, I had to get a 80% or I was grounded and had to take the lessons over again.

It was impossible for me! I tried so hard, but no matter how much I tried it didn't matter. I would be literally fighting myself to stay awake, and forget the last 30 seconds of my life. I didn't know what was wrong with me!

I did the only thing I could, and that was cheat. This is my biggest regret in my entire life, I had cheated through ninth grade to 12th, hardcore. I installed a virtual machine, which for some reason Windows 7 gave admin rights inside of it even if you were a standard user. I had copied the answers from the Teacher edition.

Eventually, the guilt overwhelmed me and I admitted this to my parents. They were not happy at all and made it much harder for me. I then had to use a keylogger to steal the password and grade the courses myself.

I felt so guilty, I had graduated high school by cheating and as far as everyone is concerned, I have no better education than a 7th grader. I no absolutely no math at all, I even struggle with addition and subtraction. I became very depressed, and was given anti-depressants which didn't work at all. I did make a recovery from depression however, but it was during dark times. I didn't realize I was gay until right around this time, and it kind of hit me all at once. But it was a huge weight lifted when I got out of the closet, as if I was suppressing my own feelings without realizing it.


So at this point, I did the only thing I could do. I started studying in computers, as much as I could. I got the shittiest help desk job and moved up the ladder and make decent money, but currently feel I have hit the glass ceiling. I opened up to my friends here and many of them felt that my medication for ADHD was ""cheating"" and that being tired is perfectly normal. This hurt me the most because these co-workers were the closest thing to me other than my parents and they totally disregarded my problems as something normal and I was taking the easy way out.


I felt no doctor could figure out what was wrong with me so I literally diagnosed myself, I did research online and with the symptoms I had and blood test results I knew I had the conditions. 

I tested positive for Narcolepsy, which involves taking 5 naps with 2 hour breaks in-between. I fell asleep on 4 out 5 of them, hitting REM within 6 minutes.

I was rated at 48-72 hours of constant sleep deprivation. My entire life, I was misdiagnosed as having ADHD.  To make this even worse, I also had sleep apnea despite not being overweight. I inherited the sleep apnea, from my mother and narcolepsy from my father.

It was an overwhelming experience, everything made sense. I no longer feel stupid and understand why I had so many problems.

But in return I feel my entire life has been wasted and I am not sure what to do. I had cheated through High School, skipped college and only went into IT knowing that it didn't require an education. I had played life the best I can with the cards dealt.

But now knowing this can be treated and I can go to college, I am scared. Part of me regrets not being more resilient to my parents by complaining I needed help, but they never believed I had issues as I had good hyper-focus. I was writing scripts in games at age 9, so they felt I was more than smart enough to handle it.

Perhaps my calling is to become a doctor myself, but having no education and starting from High School just not sure if it's possible.  

I know I can't blame my parents, they couldn't have known. There's nothing I can do to change the past, but hopefully my story can help support others who have similar issues with staying awake and feel trapped. TIFU isn't for getting advice, it's for letting people know you fucked up... and I did. 

Tomorrow is a new life for me.


TLDR: I had massive sleep deprivation from both Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea, misdiagnosed as ADHD and given Adderall. It was impossible for me to function, my family had too much high standards that I had to cheat and I ended up here today knowing how to fix this problem and feel I wasted 16 years of my life,  not knowing what my future is. 

My entire life all of my friends called me lazy for admitting taking Adderall, explaining I couldn't stay awake. Constantly being told why don't I try being a normal person and not take drugs as ADHD is a load of crap. Being tired was normal, etc.





"
"TIFU by thinking I could outsmart a Scientology stress test administered by a Scientology Auditor on an e-meter.


Ok, in this instance ""today"" is 25 years ago. To cut to the chase, I am well on my way to recovering from this FU but it took a very long time, with the help of some very good people. 

25 years ago I was a high school Junior attending one of the many high schools in Albuquerque, NM. Most campuses had an open lunch policy and me and my friends would often travel to a local Wendy's located roughly at the intersection of Menual and Wyoming. At this time the Church of Scientology had a Dianetics center in the adjoining strip mall (Hoffmantown Center). Every day at lunch there was an odd, sloop shouldered man who would hang around the Wendy's asking the mostly student customers if they were interested in improving their academics, athletics, he would ask if we wanted to improve our relationships with our girlfriends (or even get girlfriends), our relationships with our parents and teachers. 

I was pretty much the typical picture of the late 80s/early 90s high schooler, somewhat athletic, suffering grades, smoked a little weed, drank at the bonfire parties held on the mesa every weekend. But I was also probably smarter that I gave my self credit for and I always felt like something was missing. I also thought I was pretty funny and street smart (as much as kid from the NE Heights could be). 

One day we were at the Wendy's and the Dianetics guy came up and sat next to us. Thinking we were being funny, we started goofing on him about his clothes, his odd glasses and hair style (think David Koresh with less charisma). As I look back on it, we were vicious, way more vicious than we should have been but it didn't seem to affect him at all. He let it roll off his back and still offered to help us discover all the things that were holding us back, that all he needed was an hour of our time and he could show us our endless potential. We finished lunch, he said something like ""maybe next time"" and I remember I got a big laugh from my friends when I said ""I seriously doubt it Skolnick"" as we were walking away. 

Maybe a week later we went back to that Wendy's and sure enough he was there. He again approached us with his standard spiel, but this time emboldened by my buddies and the ribbing we gave this guy the last time, I agreed to take his stress test. So did another of my friends. I just knew for a fact that I would get in there with my friend, we'd get some off some hilarious jokes with each other and we'd finally get this poor nerdy guy to snap and let it show that we had gotten to him. I had no idea what a stress test was but I figured that whatever it was, I'd be in and out in an hour and have a great story for my friends about how I'd snapped the poor fucker. 

We were so convinced that we were going to work this over, my friend and I decided to ditch 5th and 6th period and do our stress test. We walked over to the strip mall with this guy and again he exuded a strange calm while we mocked him from behind, my friend even gave him a ""flat tire"" then kicked his shoe into the parking lot while I tried to not laugh uncontrollably. The Diantics guy dutifully picked up his shoe, put it on and continued walking. He unlocked the door to a very unassuming but mostly blacked out storefront and he immediately said that my friend and I would have to do our stress test separately and that if we could be patient he would have another auditor on the way. Well shit, I thought...I could skip classes but if this ""joke"" leaked into baseball practice, I would not get to play that coming weekend. I said this to the guy and while I didn't know it at the time, this was his first clue into what vulnerabilities he would play into later. 

My friend and I agreed and I decided to go first. We walked into a seperate room that looked like it was a movie set from the 70s that would be labeled as ""office, unassuming, not comfortable"" on the script. There were mustard colored vinyl chairs, wood paneled walls, musty and frayed carpet and a laminate desk between the seats. On top of the desk was an electronic device with two soup cans (literally) attached to wires coming from the device. 

He sat me down and asked me to pick up the cans. His first question

""what is your name?""

I answered. 

""what is your full name?

I added my middle name. 

""was that always your name""

I said no, I was adopted by a step dad when I was a baby.

""What is your name?""

I said the name given by my step dad again. 

""What is your name?""

Every time I would answer he'd jot down a note on a big yellow legal pad. 

""What is your name?"" He asked again. 

Just wanting this line of questioning to be over with I answered with my birth name. He seemed to nod with approval at something on the e-meter and moved on. In that session he asked me about secrets I'd been keeping from my parents, he got it out of me that I really wasn't happy playing baseball because the coach wasn't giving me enough playing time, that I was an under achiever in school, that I had zero luck with girls because I was too shy around them. As the session was winding to a close, I absolutely remember him looking right at me and saying ""come back, and I can get you more playing time."" I asked him how, that would probably require him talking to the coach. He said he would love to talk to my coach as well, but that the power to get more playing time was within me. Looking back... all the swagger I walked into that little office was gone and I was looking forward to my next auditing session. I was hooked. 

I spend the next ~22 years as a dedicated Scientologist. I don't have any of the truly exotic stories of abuse of power because I never joined the Sea Org and was a relatively detached member. But I did spend a small fortune on Scientology services, I dutifully believed that the church had changed my life for good.  In my 20's I married another Scientologist, had two kids and am currently going through a bitter divorce that is ripping my kid's lives apart because their mother still insists on having them in the church while I want them out. Her legal bills are most likely being paid by a Scientology benefactor (my lawyer is trying to figure this out). 

I rubbed elbows with true celebrities in the Celebrity Center in LA, I got to attend events that have now become youtube famous for their creepiness and disconnect with the world at large. I am lucky in that I was able to start and maintain a successful business (largely with help from the Church and it's networks at the beginning, I have to admit) and am not dead broke, but I have seen well off people reduced to a lifetime diet of ramen noodles because of the expense and expectations of the church. If I were to total it out, I would guess that I've spent $115,000 on services and donations to the church. That number compounds if you add the services and donations in the name of my wife and kids. 

I'm lucky that my parents never abandoned me, had I joined the SeaOrg (which I considered doing prior to having kids, but was discouraged because my business &lt;in other words; donations&gt; was ""too important"" to the church at large) I would have lost track of them as well. They have helped me come to terms with the time I spent in the church, they still love me and still fight to see their grandkids (current state has a grandparents rights statute in divorce cases) and most importantly allowed me to keep a foot in the outside world. 

This fuck up will never truly end however as I get near daily calls and emails for donations from the church. I get a forests worth of direct mail asking me to come back and experience the new auditing techniques or to take a tour of Flag Base in Clearwater. Worst of all, unless my soon to be ex-wife also ""blows,"" my kids will forever be exposed to the Church of Scientology. 

tl:dr: 25 years ago, I fucked up thinking I could outsmart a Scientology Auditor. I spend about 22 years and well into the six figures and exposed my kids to a life time of Scientology because...no...I couldn't outsmart a Scientology Auditor. 

Edit: wow this really blew up but I imagine it's winding down now so I should have edited this earlier. I've actually run into several people from Albuquerque I knew in high school...that's crazy. No I didn't go to Sandia, we would just go to that particular Wendy's because no chance of our teachers or admin staff being there.

I didn't make this clear but in the first writing but my mom and I were abandoned by my real dad when I was an infant. I have a great step dad who really sacrificed a lot to take us on, however when my little brother was born my step dad treated us very differently. About this time (I was 9) I was told he wasn't my real dad and that my real dad had tried to get in touch with me. So pre-teenaged (and teenaged) me seethed with resentment over both being abandoned (real dad never showed up for his promised meeting--have no idea where he is to this day) and thinking I was treated worse because of biology. As someone said below the auditor was doing a cold reading basically and either the meter really did jump or he read my reaction to the name question and took me off guard by going down that path. Had I answered ""yes, that's my real name"" he would have gone to something else. I should have made it clearer why this had such a big impact on me.

And to by far most common question, I did not get any more playing time. I actually really hurt my knee at the end of junior year and could never generate the power in my swing after that...I actually sat most of senior year and any long shot college prospects I had were long gone."
"TIFU by trying to ask a girl out and then breaking her skull.


This just happened like 3 hours ago.

I was at a wedding and was bored to no end. I was standing outside the wedding hall because it had rained earlier and the weather was very pleasant. I see this girl about the same age as me, i actually kind of knew her. I grew up in a very conservative area and only now I had moved to a more ( you could say) liberal area. Because of this, I have no idea, on how to ask a girl etc, and I just clamp up in front of girls. But this was the day, i thought to myself that this is the day that everything changes.

I start thinking on how to intiate conversation, what to say etc. I make up a great plan on how I will ""accidentally"" bump into her and apologize and start talking about how boring the wedding is and how one thing will lead to another. You can probably guess what happened next.

She is still standing there. I start walking after her and try to bump her. But the pavement was slppery and she was wearing heels. I bump her, she slips and falls on her head. I just froze for a minute. There was blood everywhee. I start shouting for someone to help us(we were like just outside of the marquee). A group of people come near us and someone calls an ambulance. I hold her head. I feel so bad.

This girl was the younger sister of my sister's friend. I have never felt so bad in my life. By this time, 80% of the people inside of the marquee were outside including her sister. The ambulance came and they picked her up and her sister also got in the ambulance with tears in her eyes. I felt so bad. I want to visit her in the hospital tomorrow as my sister is going tomorrow to visit her but I feel like an all round douche and I don't know if I should go.

TL;DR: Tried to intiate conversation with girl by ""accidentally"" bumping into her. Pavement was wet, she slipped and broke her head.

Edit: I have commented here before, but the thing is that she was taken to a military hospital(it was the nearest). Her father is in the military and hence doesn't have to pay for anything.(I don't know if military hospitals cover children of officers but here they do). I am going tomorrow with flowers and chocolates. Wish me Luck Reddit!"

"TIFU and deciding to go to sleep in a car and almost dying


When I was about 15-16(couple years ago) I stayed with my sister a lot. Their house was disgusting(the type where nobody ever cleaned anything ever) and I was fed up with sleeping in a house that nasty, so I decided to go sleep in their big ass van, which was slightly less nasty. Well I was stupid and didn't realize that it would be really hot the next day. I woke up in what had to have been 100+ degree weather, my vision was so blurry I could barely see, I could barely lift my hand to open the car door, I was drenched in sweat. Stumbled inside after a minute, told everyone what happened, they looked at me like I was stupid, and I was. It was the middle of summer, I don't know why I thought it would be okay to sleep there. Worst part is that my sister has kids and they would have been devastated if I accidentally died in their car.


I literally JUST realized while I was writing this that all of my near death experiences(I have a few) have been directly and clearly caused by my own stupidity and not just bad luck or accident. Damn. "

I work in a kitchen, so one of my duties is to clean the hood vent housing biweekly. I usually take pride in the job, because I know no one else does it as well as me.

Anyway, I also have pride in my hair, and I hate getting grease and cleaner in it while I'm up there, so like usual I grab an apron and tie it around my head like a bandanna. I always do this, so I was not expecting what happened next.

As I was cleaning near the air shaft which was pulling air, it yanks my apron off my head. I yelp and scream to my coworker, who looks up at me in confusion. He is dumping grease from a drip tray into a tiny hole for disposal; a precision job if there ever was one. The next second was a series of banging from the fan, followed by  me screaming at him to turn off the fans. The next moment was him dropping the grease all over the floor and running to the switches on the wall (not where the fan switch is). What followed was him flicking on/off all the lights, while yelling ""in the office!""

The fan is off, and there's grease all over the floor, while I am still wearing normal shoes while waiting for new non-slips to arrive. We tried retrieving the apron but Solid Snake must be fucking anorexic if he can fit through the vents. We ended up giving up, I called my boss, and I hope it all gets sorted out in the morning, hoping I keep my job or get that raise I wanted still...

TL;DR - Tried to be Solid Snake, ended up with Liquid on the floor. Fission mailed.

Edit: Good lord, the upvotes. Love you all /r/TIFU I'll update after my scolding tomorrow. Good night. &lt;3**

Edit 2: I go to bed with 140 upvotes and wake up to 1600. Seriously. &lt;3**

Edit 3: I just only had breakfast. 2k? and Gold?! (Edit 3.5 - Front Page too. o_O) Wow, misery does love company. Restaurant's been open for a while, haven't received any bad ~~codecs~~ calls/texts. About to head out and receive my OSS (On Site Scolding) soon though. &lt;3**

Edit 4: [Snuck out to do this edit.](https://imgur.com/wNE53wJ) The Boss is on an off site mission. Got a scolding. Will update more with pics when ~~Shalashaska~~ Otacon arrives for the closing shift. I work 11 hours with strict no phone policy. &lt;3**

Edit 5: I'll fix the brackets when I get home. I'm no good with Reddit mobile. I have a short break. Apparently we shut the hoods off in time. The Boss' SO pulled out a shredded greasy apron from the roof, so all is well now. Was expecting to get yelled at. Got more of a disappointment chat. Heartbreaking. I keep my job, but I don't think I'll get a raise. I'm ok with that.

People seem to be misunderstanding the office's location and the kitchen's size. We are a small place. The office is 3 steps from the range. We clean the hoods weekly. We do NOT have a deep fryer, which is why the hoods are not done daily. Also the greasy mess was not big. It's just a litre. It was a minor pain but still gross. When we close up I'll share pictures of the whole thing. &lt;3**

Edit 6.1: I just got home. It was an unexpectedly busy night. Formatting and blurring pictures and videos to protect the innocent. Then I can put this TIFU to rest 'til my next post (deciding between the car fu or umbrella fu). Seriously, thanks for everything guys. It started with one fan, then having at least 3000 more made my day.

Edit 6.2: The imgur links begin.

TL;DR for updates: Apron was extracted from roof, I keep my job, shoes ruined.

Alternate TL;DR: Almost caused a Metal Gear Wreck by equipping Infinite Ammo item, ended up confronting the Boss, Fail Mission, but I can still Retry.

Love you /r/TIFU! &lt;3**"
