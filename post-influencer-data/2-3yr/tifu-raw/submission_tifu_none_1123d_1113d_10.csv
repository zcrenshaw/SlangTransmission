"TIFU by applying for jobs with the Windows 10 Mail app for a year.


Finally, I get to post one of these! And bonus, it happened today! This is pretty much the only bright side to the whole thing, sadly.

Because I am human, I enjoy money, and I decided quite a while ago that I wanted more of it, so I started applying for other jobs. Also, because I live in the 21st century, and you can't just wander into a building and instantly become the manager anymore, I've been doing all of these applications online. So, being the good little applicant that I am, I made sure my CV was perfect and up-to-date, and made sure to write a personalised cover letter for every single job I applied for. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, except for the fact that over the past few months, I haven't even been getting any rejections any more, much less positive replies or interviews.

This continued on for several months, and all the while, my self-esteem started to plummet. A whole bunch of idiots from my high school have decent jobs! I see them on Facebook! How come I can't get one? Last week, trying to be a little less direct in my approach, I decided to email a whole bunch of recruitment agencies too...and even they didn't reply. What? I could be making you money, guys! Don't just ignore me! What are you, every girl I ever knew until age 17?

The fact that they didn't reply stirred up my curiosity. My CV is saved as a Word document, but I use an alternative program. Maybe the formatting is getting messed up and making me look unprofessional, and I can't see it on my PC? So, I decided to email my girlfriend to test it...using the Windows 10 Mail app. As I have been since probably last July.

I sent her an email with the CV attached, and the subject ""Test"". [This is what she received.](http://i.imgur.com/0VgvAdy.jpg) No attachments or anything. I then decided to try using the browser version of Gmail, which I haven't done in a long time. It worked perfectly.

7 fucking months, Microsoft. 7 Goddamn shitty fucking months since I've had a job interview. Eat a fucking bouquet of dicks.

**TL;DR: Microsoft broke all my fucking job applications for the better part of a year and I had no idea.**

Edit: Not suing Microsoft, guys. First, this is almost certainly my fault (I AM on TIFU, not techsupport). Second, I am English. We don't sue. We complain in the pettiest medium available to us. "
"TIFU by blowing $10,000.


Today I fucked up, big time. I have been trading currencies for around 3 months and was getting good results (maybe beginners luck who knows). I decided to go the next step and borrowed $10,000 from the bank so I could put on bigger trades and hopefully get bigger profits.

After a week I made $4,000 in one day (in a few hours) in a great trade. After that I thought I was invincible and kept getting bolder and bolder with my trades. Needless to say today I lost it all, including the $10,000 which I borrowed from the bank. In one day. Gone.

I'm 28, casually employed and have no real assets. I feel like my gut has been wrenched from inside out and I also had to break the news to my girlfriend whose birthday is just around the corner. 

Pretty huge fuck up, one of the biggest in my entire life. 


**Edit:** Surprised at all the feedback I've gotten in such a short amount of time. All the troll comments are making me laugh, at least that is something positive out of all of this. Important thing is to remember no matter how smart or safe you think you are we are all humans and make mistakes or stuff doesn't go our way. It's the way you deal with it after that counts. Cheers for all the comments."
"TIFU by declining the services of a lady of the evening


While not today, this happened recently, so recently that I’m a little worried that some kind hotel maintenance employee is going to see this and start putting pieces together in his head and figure out what happened, but I know if I don’t post this now I’ll forget it.

I was in Las Vegas for work.  Not an unusual event for me; in fact so not unusual that I normally come and go without touching a casino table or doing almost anything “Vegas” while I’m there.  But I was entertaining others, wound up spending too much time too late at night at the bar, and when I got back to my hotel I made the mistake of sitting down alone for one last drink at one of the bars downstairs on the casino floor.

Sitting and minding my own business, I’m approached by a beautiful brunette who asks if she can sit down next to me and if I have any interest in buying her a drink.  She’s pretty enough, and I tell her I’d love to buy her a drink.  We get to talking, normal stuff, asking lots about me and what I do, and after about 30 minutes of flirting and laughing and talking and drinking, she asks if I have a room, and if so if I want to go upstairs.

“Fuck yeah, I still have it,” I think to myself.  I tell her that “I think that’s a lovely idea,” and we head up to my room.

We get up to my room, and she looks around, walks in and out of the bathroom, then comes over to me and says “it’s $700 for an hour, but don’t worry about the time, I’m not going to rush you and we’re going to have a lot of fun.”

After a quick though as to whether I could afford such a sum, my better judgment came to me, and the blood quickly drained from my second brain as something resembling depression set in.  I explained to her that I had completely misread the situation, and that there was no way I could pay her that kind of money.

She was angry at first, telling me that she’d been clear from the beginning, and asking why I changed my mind.  After some negotiating downward in price, to which I continued to decline each offer, I handed her fifty bucks from my wallet, apologized for wasting her time, and wished her well.  She thanked me for “being a sweetheart” and told me not to apologize, but asked if she could quickly use my bathroom to freshen up before she left.  No problem, she uses the toilet, freshens up, kisses me on the cheek and leaves.  I go to sleep and wake up to my alarm going off way too early the next morning.

I hit snooze a few times, and finally drag my hung-over butt out of bed to the shower.
Where I’m greeted by a very large, very long, very messy, and very-much-not-mine turd sitting on the dry shower floor.

Fuck.

She’d left me a present.

Unfortunately, this is only where my fuck up begins.

Not wanting to touch her shit, I decide to start the shower, point the water over it, and let it wash away until it broke up and ran down the drain.  I turn the shower on, start with just cold water in order not to steam up and spread the smell, but then realize that the pressure is better with hot water and crank up the temperature, point it at the turd, close the curtain, and walk away.

Fifteen minutes later, I get a knock on my door.  Maintenance is standing outside the room asking if they can help, as water is coming through the ceiling in the bathroom below mine.

Shit.  Fuck.  What????  Shit shit shit shit shit.

At this point, I have the door closed and haven’t looked, but I quickly tell him that “I’m sorry, the tub overflowed earlier, it’s all taken care of and I mopped up the floor with towels, and I’m very sorry for the inconvenience.”  He tells me all is good, and runs off to bring me fresh towels.  In the meantime I run into the bathroom where I find half an inch of water on the floor, as the shower curtain was hanging on the wrong side of the tub and the shower for the past 15-20 minutes has been spraying 1/3 of its spray directly onto the bathroom floor.

I quickly shut off the shower, and start mopping up the floor, but wow is this a lot of water.  I use up all my towels, and luckily get a knock on the door a minute later with the maintenance man bringing more.  A couple more and the floor is in pretty good shape, and I’m all set.  Hopefully no charges appear on my bill, no bad damage, big fuckup avoided.

I’m late at this point, though, and need to get showered and out the door.  I quickly strip, poke my head in to turn the shower back on, and see that **the fucking turd is still there**.  Now that’s not completely accurate.  Probably 2/3 of the turd was still there.

At this point I’m fucked, I’m out of time, and I just need to get on with my life.  So I did it.  I pushed the turd to the drain with my foot, and slowly but surely broke it up with my toes and got it to go down.  I waffle-stomped a hooker’s shit.

I remember now why I don’t usually drink this much.


TL;DR Made waffles with a hooker - 5/7 with rice.

"TIFU By not stepping in dog shit


This happened a few weeks back and I'm still embarrassed by it. 

Now I must set the picture of where I live. A quiet rural area where many of the residents are the kind to own a Range Rover, tweed clothing and a dog. This area also has nice scenic walks near a canal. 

Every day i take the same route to work, it's a short 30 min walk along said canal and I pass by these jolly folk walking their dogs every morning. 

Sadly these people let their dogs create a mess and some don't clean it up. So on my way to work I was reading Reddit and paying no attention to the path. At a quick glance I noticed some dog shit I was about to step on. Without being aware of my surroundings I quickly moved to the right. Only to fall in the canal!!!

One dog walker saw me and came to the rescue. Pretty embarrassing as it was my neighbour. I had to go home and ended up late for work. Lucky my boss saw the funny side. 

I'm much more careful where I walk now. Probably would have been easier to step in the shit."
"TIFU by following my kid down the stairs while I was carrying a box.


Last night I had to bring a rather large box down the stairs and my 3 year old was already halfway down. I began my descent, slowly one step at a time.

Unfortunately 3 year olds tend to be quite short so I didn't realise she had stopped.....until I knee'd that poor kid in the back and sent her flying. Luckily our stairs curve round so she didn't have far to fly and she bounced off the wall quite safely. A little lip cut nothing horrific.

Bedtime comes so it's time to say goodnight to her Dad (he works very late and did not witness the 'incident') on FaceTime. Thinking I'd got away with it I left them to chat before I hear 'OH, and mummy kicked me down the stairs'. She offered him no explanation just told him that and said goodnight. Her Dad is now probably weighing up the costs of some hidden cameras to check what the hell I do to this child while he's at work. 

TL;DR heavy box blocked my stairs view, I kicked my child down stairs, she grassed me up instantly to her dad at work.

Edit: I would like to thank every one for not calling social services on my ass! Some of the stories on this post are hilarious! Thanks for the laughs :)"
"TIFU by giving myself autism


A few years back, I was a naïve kid attending a smallish college outside of my home state. Utter shyness was my vice, and this made it nigh-on impossible to get a job in a town which was almost exclusively clerk/ cashier positions. Every interview I went to, I would cripple over into myself and sweat profusely. Still, I needed a job – badly. 

So, when I saw a ‘help needed’ sign in the general store’s window, I was eager to check it out. This place was old school; it looked as if it had been preserved from the social-contract times of the 1940s and the owner was an elderly man of eighty years. I ask after him and the old guy hobbles out, extending a hearty handshake. 

We walk off to a backroom and he begins to ask the usual questions, I begin to get uneasy and jumpy like usual. This seems to make the old man nervous also and a perplexed expression forms across his face as his brow furrows. “Say, why ya nervous all of a sudden?” the man asks. In a panic, the sweat funnelling down my neck, my hands becoming clammy, I was in a corner and this was the last chance saloon – “Er, well, you probably ought to know I have autism”

Fuck! A look of compassion and sympathy spreads over the old man, yet I want to run away. “None to worry, can you stack shelves for a couple of hours a day?” I continue to look at the ground, praying for it to swallow me whole, “yes, sir.”

And so, every day for four or five hours, I stock the store’s shelves whilst pretending to be autistic. I saw ‘Rain Man’ kind of once when I was on a flight, and I do my best to imitate Hoffman’s Raymond Babbit. If a customer came to me and asked for an item, I’d echo their words under my breath, or twitch my body around, or mumble incoherently. It was a shitty situation all round, but I needed the money and I was doing no harm. 

This ploy continued through to spring, until one day the old man asks me if I want to work front-shop ‘to build some confidence’. Reluctantly, I agree and continue doing a sub-par impression of an autistic man for the few customers that walk in. The old man stands beside me sorting out items, he seems proud.

A few hours pass and I slip into the routine. Suddenly, my mom and dad stroll through the door – I had forgotten they were coming up to visit me, oh shit! 

They walk up to the desk and hug me, I cannot react else the old man beside me will know the ruse is up. “How are you?” my mom asks with a big smile. “mrrr…” comes my reply. Mom looks confused, “mrr, mrr, work,” I repeat. 

“What the hell, are you fucking with us?” The old man steps forward and leans over the desk, he thinks a random couple have come in to abuse me. “This kid has autism, you fucking old whore, get the fuck out of my store.” My dad, my mom, and me stand with our mouths agape. Sensing I had to mitigate the situation, I throw my apron on the floor and run like Forrest Gump to my car, I floor it to my dorm.

Several hours later I get a call, it is my dad. “Son, have you ever been tested for the spectrum?” 

TL;DR: Recreated Rain Man with the old guy from Up"

"TIFU by knocking out my brother with a potato


Obligatory, this didn't happen today. It happened around 11 years ago, and has only come to mind from all the potato posts recently. Maybe we should just get rid of potatoes?

Be me, somewhere between 7-10 years old, playing outside on a hot summers day. I was one of three children, and my parents were relatively rich for the area we lived in (one of the most expensive streets around that area). This meant that we had some of the coolest toys, swimming pools, them battery-powered racecars; the lot. 


Now there is 2 years between myself and my other brothers (so if I was 8, my little brother was 6 and my older 10). We'd always mess around and play pranks on eachother whenever we could, such as launching a water balloon out of the window to hit someone in the head.

Timmy was my best friend who lived just across the street, and his parents got him a new toy. He had a [spud gun](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBITDO15l78f4J68Ia9N_TQ.jpg). The way a spud gun works is you dig it into a potato, break it off and then you fire a bit of potato with some air pressure. It didn't hurt when you got hit (as long as it wasn't the eyes!) and it was all just for a little bit of fun, plus it was hilarious when your parents got mad about finding billions of bits of potato around the house. So, me being me, I decided to play a prank on my older brother. Timmy and I stole two huge fucking potatoes (I have no idea how they were so big, maybe I was just really little) and we went upstairs. We basically played an army game, and the target was my brother. We ran into my parents room, and opened the window as quietly as possible. We loaded up the spud gun, and started shooting at my brother. Nothing. Nothing at all. The potato pieces were barely reaching him and he was too focused standing up playing Pokemon on his Gameboy. We tried to keep doing this for a few minutes, but got bored as most 8 year olds would. We then came up with the **worst fucking idea known to man**. Rather than shooting potato at him through the spud gun, lets just chuck one of the overly-sized potatoes at him!

And the FU begins...

I pick up this potato, which I can only describe as looking like the fat woman out of 50 First Dates, charge my little arms up as humanely possible for a 2ft 8 year old, and sling this potato towards the body of my brother.

 Direct hit! 

In the head! 

Oh wait, is he okay? 

**MUUUUUUMMMMMMM**

4 hours later, I am sitting with my dad in the ER while my brother is having MRI scans or whatever they do when you hurt yourself in the head. Basically what happened, the potato hit him in the back of the head, this was enough force to sling him head first into the concrete slabs, which caused a small crack in his skull just above his hairline. He had bandages on his head for a few days and missed a couple of days of school, but I'm pretty confident he was just as brain damaged before that happened as he is now (21 in a few months...)

TL;DR: Friend had a spud gun. Spud gun was bad. Threw entire whale of a potato at brother. Hit his head. Cracked his skull. FU.

Potatoes are bad for this world, they just fuck everything up.

Edit: wow, my highest most upvoted thing ever is about throwing a potato at my brothers head and knocking him out? Free internet points!"

"TIFU by dislocating my girlfriend’s knee while having sex [NSFW]


This happened a couple months back, but I was too traumatized to write about it on the day of.

I (about 160 lbs) was doing the deed with my girlfriend (about 100 lbs), nothing too unusual.
We were having a great time, both enjoying the intimacy of the moment.
I was on top, and I wanted to switch it up.

While I was still inside her, I tried to roll around to switch up our positions.
But then I heard it: a loud ‘pop’ from underneath my leg.

Her soft moans started to get louder, until they became screams.
I was confused, and didn’t know what was happening until I looked down and saw that her left leg was looking a bit unnatural.

She started hyperventilating, and in between her gasps, she screamed, “MY” *gasp* “LEG!!” *gasp* “KNEE” *gasp* “DISLOCATED!!” *gasp*.

She was going into shock, and if she didn’t breathe, things would get much worse soon.
I was panicking myself, but I tried my best to stay calm, and told her to breathe deeply and slowly. I started breathing with her, and eventually got her to start inhaling some air.

Then like a champ, she kicked her leg back, and with a loud CRACK, her left knee popped back into place.
That crack is a sound I will never forget...

She had to wear knee braces for the next couple months, since she used to feel pain in her knees whenever she climbed up or down the stairs.
Thankfully, she’s okay now and feels no discomfort in her daily activities, but has since developed a slight aversion to hills and stairs.

We laugh about it now, but back then, I felt terrible and was worried the damage would be permanent.

So gents, the few seconds you save from switching positions while still ‘connected’ to your partner is not worth the risk of dislocating your partner’s knee. Don’t be a dumbass like me, and make sure to switch positions when your bodyweight is NOT on your partner’s leg.

Oh, and we are still together.
We actually got married 3 months a go, and we are still going strong! :)

TL; DR - Tried to switch positions while still inside my girlfriend, dislocated her knee. Still got married.

EDIT: Actually, according to my wife u/gomteddy, the knee-incident apparently happened about a year a go. I guess the trauma makes it feels more recent than it actually is. 

EDIT2: According to a lot of comments here, she probably didn't dislocate her knee, but her kneecap. I don't know which, but I'm guessing it's her kneecap since she's not in rehab. 
When she got it checked, the doctor said her cartilage got bruised while the knee/kneecap was dislocated and cracked back into place. 

EDIT3: I don't remember because I was so traumatized by the dislocation, but according to my wife, we were back at it after she popped her knee/kneecap back in. So, I finished lol
And 'a couple' = 2 months. Also, 'ago' not 'a go'. Got it. "
"TIFU By smoking weed with this guy I'm trying to woo, then getting the worst case of the fear ever


TIFU by inviting this guy(25M) I'm trying to woo over to my (25F) house for the evening. We've been on a few dates,  but I was pretty sure this was going to be the deciding date on where things were going. Anyway, we're chilling out then decide to smoke some weed. Which usually is fine I can handle it. So smoke two joints,  make tea,  and go upstairs. 

All is going smoothly until suddenly I feel THE FEAR and PARANOIA coming on. We all know it. Lying there trying to act cool and chill.... Until eventually I just have to tell him to please stop talking and that I am going to die.... Dramatic I know now.  I tell him to go downstairs to get housemate/BFF to come save me. At this point I am frozen on my back in the bed with the worst paranoia of my life.  I'm (for some reason) convinced that Guy Crush is a weirdo and WTF is he doing in my room he's going to kill me... But still trying to play it cool....  Not for long. 

Housemate comes in,  and obviously finds it hilarious. Guy crush remains in room being all comforting and nice... But deep down I know he's a serial killer... I try to communicate this with my eyes to my housemate.... Obviously not very subtly either as she is still finding it hilarious. She gets me 7UP and Haribo to try help me comedown... While still taking the piss asking would I also like dreadlocks with that.. Or maybe we can listen to some reggae.  She reassures me nothing out of the ordinary is happening....  But not in my head. 

The Fear begins to get so bad that I start to jump at every sudden movement that Guy Crush/Serial Killer is making. And then... Of course to make matters worse...  In a scene reminiscent of when Chandler takes a bath in Friends, or when Ben Stiller gets himself stuck in his zipper in the film Something About Mary... The rest of my housemates are at the door sticking there heads in wondering Hey why is everyone in here,  what's going on... Then see me frozen on my back in the bed with eyes as big as saucers and they finally back away...and I hear the giggles starting from downstairs. This doesn't help my paranoia as I convince myself the only way out of this situation is to burn the house down. 

Still very conscious of Guy Crush/Serial Killer beside me.... He reaches out a hand to comfort me... This is the last straw.. I jump about two foot into the air and tell him HE HAS TO LEAVE. He leaves... The room. 

Once we're alone,  I tell housemate she HAS to get him out of house before he kills us all. She reassures me Not to worry... About a thing... Cuz,  every little thing... Is gunna be alright. -_-

We sit for what's probably an hour of me jumping and tuning into every little sound the house is making... Waiting for it to fall down or a chainsaw to roar from downstairs. Eventually it turned out Guy Crush just left without saying anything... After his DAD had to collect him (I was supposed to drop him home). He left a note saying not to worry about it and it happens everyone... A note I immediately interpreted as a blatant death threat in my Fear riddled state. 

After he has left,  I eventually ride it out and I go to sleep. Have to get up for work the next morning and literally have just pretended like nothing has happened. Which I will continue to do for the foreseeable future. Could the date have gone any worse? No. "

"TIFU for stealing Yugioh cards from walmart and served 2 months in jail for it.


This happened last year, but decided to make my first fuck up post. This one is worth the share now that i look back on it.  Let me give a bit of background about myself before i share this story with you guys. Me and my buddy were homeless, and the way to pass time after we got off work, was to play with Pokemon and Yugioh cards in fast food places. 

I was working at Walmart at the time, and decided to steal three  big fucking boxes  of yugioh cards. The boxes was worth $25 each. After i got off work, i went to the card aisle, and casually looked left and right, and ripped the security tag sticker off of the boxes, and just walked out with it. I  at the time, was not under the influence of any drugs, so I did this stone cold sober.

I have no idea what was going through my  head when i  committed this heinous crime, but apparently I gave no fucks. So I get out the doors, and the alarm didn't go off, so I thought to myself ""Holy shit, I did it!"" I sprinted towards my buddy sitting in the car with excitement. 

I proceed to get in the passenger seat, shaking in amazement. I tell him ""dude lets go to mcdonalds and try these decks out"" Hes just as excited as I am. We leave Walmart, and head to Mcdonalds. We play 3 Games, before my girlfriend calls, and says ""I need you to bring my car back to my work, Im about to get off"" so We did. 

We pack up our new presents, and head to her work. We are sitting in the car, smoking weed, laughing, and playing Yugioh. Im 19 when this happened, and hes 27. A police car pulled up on us, and my friend went from ""dude im so happy and high "" to the most paranoid person on the planet in 0.2 seconds.  He cups the blunt in his hand to hide it, and i can tell its hurting him.  The cop gets out and walks to the window, and He says, ""Where were you guys earlier?"" I get struck with paranoia and fear.  My mind is racing to come up with an intelligent answer, because im sitting here with the fucking evidence all over my lap, on top of the middle console, and the dashboard. I could only come up with, ""uhm we...we just got back from mcdonalds playing a trading card game o...officer"" he replied with what i expected ""Where were you before that?"" 

Im sweating and nervous as fuck and scared all at the same time. I knew i was going to go to jail, because this would be my third offense petty larceny, and in my state, 3 petty larcenies get amended to a Grand larceny. Anyways, the officer and I are going back and forth about are whereabouts, and i couldn't take the immense pressure, so I said ""I was at Walmart and stole these cards sir"" He asked me to get out of the car and I did. Another officer was coming up and found the pot in the car, it was about a gram. He didnt charge me with that tho. My Girlfriend comes outside confused as fuck and starts crying ""what did you do!?"" the whole restaurant workers there knows me as well, and are right behind her. At this point, i'm so ashamed and embarrassed because they see that im getting put in handcuffs over some Yugioh cards. 

I get taken back to walmart in the Loss prevention room, and sign some papers, and got fired, and can never work for walmart again. As expected, I was charged with Grand Larceny. I go in front of the magistrate and to my surprise, got out on my own recognizance. Went to court plead guilty, and the felony was dropped to a petty larceny, and served 2 months in jail. No one in jail knew why i was there. I would not dare tell them the truth. So there ya go. Thats one of my biggest fucks up. If there are any errors, i apologize.  

TL;DR Stole yugioh cards, served 2 months in jail for it.  

Edit: Forgot to mention how the cop knew where we were and knew we stole. So Walmart watched me steal the cards, i think it was a secret shopper, if you dont know what that is, Walmart pays Loss Prevention employees, to walk around and pretend there shopping, but spying on customers to make sure there arent stealing. When i left, they went on the cameras, saw the license plate, called the police, then the police went to my girlfriends dads house, because the car was in his name. Her dad told the police where my girlfriend works and they showed up at her work to ask her if she knew where i was, little did he know, it was I, waiting for the cop, but no seriously, I was already at her work when they came.       


Edit: WOW! I didn't think this was would blow up. When I get off work today, I'll do an AMA. "
"TIFU by traumatizing my sister


Ok, so this didn't happen today, but my sister was talking about it recently and it reminded me.

When i was younger, probably around 11, I was really into Call of Duty (the good 'ol days). I had a friend as well that was into the game, and sometimes we would have sleep overs where we would play all night long. 

One night, my friend was over and we were planning on spending the whole night playing CoD. Except, come 11:00 pm, we couldn't find my disk for the game. Me and my friend began to freak out like the little kids we were and start to ponder where it could be.

Well, I had the genius idea that maybe my sister stole it and hid it in her room. She usually plays pranks on me so this seemed very logical at the time. Keep in mind she is 5 years older than me. 

So here comes the plan me and my friend conjure up to get my video game back: when my sister goes to bed, we will quietly sneak into her room and look for the game that she obviously hid from us. Seems pretty simple, right? What could possibly go wrong?

So my friend and I put our plans into action around 12:00 am. We head up my creaky stairs unhindered (the bedrooms of my house are on the upper level). We get to my sisters room, which is located directly next to my upstairs bathroom. Except her bedroom door is closed. Every door in my house squeaks when you try to open it. I tell my friend this and he suggests we hide in the bathroom and open the door inch by inch every 30 seconds so if she wakes up and hears the door opening she wouldn't see us. My friend is a genius so I obviously agree that this is a good idea. 

About 5 minutes go by and the door is now fully open. I had no idea if my sister is awake or not, but falsely assumed we were successful and proceed to lay on the ground and slowly crawl into my sisters room. My friend is also pretty ballsy so he goes in first pretty quickly. I hear a little bit of shuffling, but being as dark as it was in my sisters room, and only having the faint luminescent glow of a nightlight in the hallways outside of the room, I couldn't tell if the shuffling noise was from my sister waking up or my friend crawling in her room.

Its my turn now, and I am a little more timid than my friend, so I slowly get on the floor and slowly start crawling into her room. Very, very slowly. I really didn't want to make any noise. I hear a little more shuffling, and see the faint silhouette of my friend under my sisters bed. ""Perfect"" I think, ""he surely found it there!"" I am in the doorway of my sister's room at this point, probably cause I was too much of a pussy to go all the way into her room so quickly.

But then, something happens.

I here a quiet yet scared sounding ""who's there?"" It was my sister. Now, with it being as dark as it was, I couldn't see her, so I assumed she couldn't see me. But in the off chance she could, I curled up into a ball with my eye's looking into the dark abyss of my sisters room, not knowing how to get out of the current predicament I was in. My logic behind curling up into a ball was ""maybe if I curl up into a ball, she will think my silhouette is just a pile of clothes."" I was fairly confident with this idea, so I remained in my sisters doorway, not moving an inch, waiting till my sister writes me off as a pile of clothing and goes back to sleep.

Except thats not what happened. I start to hear a faint whimper, almost like someone was crying really softly. I remained where I was however, cause she had to go back to sleep at some point, right?

So a really, really long 30 minutes go by with me not moving and my friend under my sisters bed. At this point, I assumed my sister went back to sleep so I concluded that it was safe to move. I slowly, inch by inch, start to crawl out of my sisters doorway, not making a single sound. Then my friend starts to head towards my position as well. No game, oh well. I think its time we take the L and leave my sisters room.

Except right as my friend moves under my sisters bed, I hear a huge scream from inside the room, and then I hear my sister jumping out of bed and running. All of the sudden, my sister comes out of the darkness, I look up, she kicks me square in the face while Im on the ground, then leaps over me with as much airtime and distance as an olympic long jumper. She darts downstairs, whaling away waking up my whole house, and possibly neighborhood, and sprints out the door all while crying out ""THERE ARE MONSTERS IN MY ROOM!!!""

5 minutes later, there are police cars at my house (My sister called them). My parents were outside trying to calm her down. And me and my friend where in the bathroom trying to figure out where we went wrong completely ignorant of the situation outside my house. 

It was really hard trying to explain the reasoning to my parents, but I took the full blame for it because I didn't want my friend to be in trouble. But lets just say I never had a sleep over after that. And my sister ended up getting a therapist. 

Oh, and the CoD disk turned out to be under the couch in front of my tv. If my friend and I looked harder, this whole incident could have been avoided.


TLDR; 
Thought my sister stole my video game so  a friend and I snuck in her room at night to look for it but ended up scaring her half to death while taking a foot to the face and getting the cops called on me.


Edit: As hard as it is to believe my sister was screaming out ""monsters"" it is in fact a true story people. My sister has really bad fright and flight mechanisms so if she gets scared she has been known to do some irrational things in terror. "
"TIFU by making my brother to vomit soap bubbles


This was a couple of years ago, but it is worth posting.

I was a young kid, and my brother is 5 years older than me. We used to have these 1 liter liquid yogurts that we both liked very much to drink, and we usually drank half a bottle at once.

At some point in life, we kids all like to make soap bubbles, and, as you know, one way to make them is to fill a bottle with water and soap and use a plastic straw. As we all also know, the best soap to make bubbles is the one to clean dishes. This is where the fuck up begins.

It is a hot summer, I'm in the kitchen pouring soap and water into an empty bottle of liquid yogurt that I drank. I mix it, and add a straw to it so I can make some bubbles outside. My brother was in his room, and I just had some fun.

As all activities of this kind, fun is a temporary experience, and, as with all kids of a certain age, stuff is left where it was last used. In this case, I just left the bottle in a table in the kitchen.

And this was where I fucked up: the picture that you can formulate in your mind, and that my brother saw when he entered the kitchen is a 1l yogurt bottle filled, with a straw leaving it.

I was not there to see this amazing feat as he grabbed the bottle, and poured all that stuff down into its throat, with its fingers holding the straw on the side so it does not fall off the bottle. The spectacle that ensues is the dream of any kid: as I enter in the kitchen my brother is puking bubbles out of his mouth (along with some other stuff that I didn't care about). At the same time, my mother, who is a physician and understands how not a health issue this is, enters in the kitchen and starts laughing like hell.

Even if this is a disgusting image, you have to acknowledge that the vomit on the ground with bubbles pouring out of is pretty fun way to introduce the concept of vomit to a kid.

Even though my brother was stomach sick for an hour or so, there were important lessons to be learned from this fu:

1. my brother learned how to not drink **our yogurts** so fast that none was left for me.

2. we agreed not using yogurt bottles anymore to make soap bubbles.

tldr; left a bottle of yogurt full of soap and a straw in the kitchen and my brother drank it like it was yogurt, making him puke soap bubbles all over the place.

P.S. my first TIFU, hope you enjoyed it."
