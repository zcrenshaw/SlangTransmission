"TIFU by giving my girlfriends cat a chance to kill us.


Normally when I go to bed I put my girlfriends cat in the spare bedroom. It is always getting into crap it shouldn't so we like to make sure it can't break anything while we sleep. Last night he was being extra calm and sweet so my girlfriend convinced me to let him stay out as a ""treat"" for good behavior. I woke up in the middle of the night because I had a dream about peeing and we all know where that leads. But as soon as I woke up I smelt a horrible smell (to groggy at the time to realize what it was) and I was very short on breathe. Turns out he somehow turned the gas on the stove on and tried to kill us in our sleep."
"TIFU when I made my Uber driver have an existential crisis.


This happen to me about an hour ago. My car broke down and had to call Uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I'm going to change the name of my job and the people I'm speaking of.)*

UD: ""Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?""

Me: ""It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.""

UD: ""Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?""

Me: ""Yeah man. I get you.""

UD: ""I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.""

Me: ""I'm glad to hear that. What is his name?""

UD: ""My boy Frank.""

Me: ""Frank...Gallagher?""

UD: ""Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.""

Me: ""Um..When was the last time you talked to him?""

UD: ""Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I'm going to hit him up soon.""

Me: ""I don't know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.""

UD: "".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.""

Me: ""I've been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.""

UD: ""No, he didn't. I'm going to call him right now because I'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.""

**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**

UD: ""He probably didn't pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha""

Me: ""Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.""

UD: ""He wasn't some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...""

Me: ""or early 50's? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I've ever trained. He died, man. I'm really sorry you found out like this.""

**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**

UD: ""I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!""

Me: ""I'm sorry...I don't know what to say"" *looks at the clock on my phone*

UD: ""He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40's bruh.*

He eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.

**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together. 
 
**Edit** name and grammar

**UPDATE** This has really blown up. I didn't expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages I received that say ""Kill Yourself asshole"" or ""Scum for doing that to a person"". [I screenshot'd the text message between the Uber Driver and I.](http://imgur.com/gallery/ErXBP) Wasn't mean or anything, he just wanted me to be certain about ""Frank"". "

"TIFU by using my gaming laptop for 4 years... with the wrong graphics card


I'm just speechless at this point. I always thought I know a bit about pc's, and people usually went to me first when they wanted to have their own fixed.

When I bought my gaming laptop 4 years ago, it wasn't absolutely topnotch, but a rather good setup. Costum built, ~2000$ XMG laptop, i7 3630QM, Geforce GTX 660M etc. Mediocre today, but quite good a few years ago.


Now I always wondered why I could play many games only on low setting, if at all. Like Witcher 3 was basically a diashow, gta 5 only on the lowest settings etc and today I bought Skyrim SE. I used to play the original one but since it was a bit laggy I just played the main story and quit.

Now I start the game, and set everything to super low... and 10FPS.

Dafuck I think, look up the requirements:

&gt;CPU:	Intel Core i5-750/AMD Phenom II X4-945
CPU Speed:	Info
RAM:	8 GB
OS:	Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit Version)
Video Card:	NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 1GB /AMD Radeon HD 7870 2GB

Comon, thats way worse than what my old gaming buddy has. I always had a thought that my laptop would use its integrated graphics, but why would it (Intel HD Graphics 4000)? I check the Nvidea control center and it says 0 supported games. After updating, it found a few games, but still, laggy as hell.

Now at this point I discovered the Nvidea control panel, or rather clicked around it - and then I saw that for whatever reason, almost all my games with the exception of League Of Legends and Stardew Valley where using my integrated graphics card instead of my Geforce.

For four years I played games with my integrated graphics card.

I just can't get over my stupidity at this point. Btw, Skyrim SE runs now at a mix of Mid/High settings @ 60FPS..."
"TIFU by eating ice cream in the back of an ambulance


-- Obligatory ""this wasn't today"" --

I'm a firefighter/EMT and live in an area that responds to a significant amount of high-speed vehicle crashes. Needless to say, we all get a little calloused after a while.

It was July and my Captain, myself, and a co-worker decided to hit up a local fro-yo joint to cool off. As we receive our delicious cups of frozen creamy goodness, we get a call from dispatch of a high speed SCHOOL BUS VS. PICKUP wreck up on the highway. This is the kind of shit you dream/worry about as a FF. We hadn't even paid yet, but the kind lady thrusts our cups of ice cream into our hands and yells at us to run, and that it's on her. As we throw our protective shit on, the guys hand me their bowls (they are up front driving) and I am left figuring out how to preserve or discard the significant amount of ice cream present.

We're hauling ass, and I have the brilliant idea to put the ice cream into the refrigerator where we keep the IV drugs. We make it to the wreck, find out there is a school bus full of kids, and a completely unrecognizable truck that had a young lady (driver) who was killed on impact. The kids were alright, but all the bystanders were pretty shaken by the scene, especially because one of the lady's legs was amputated from the hip down and was just laying in the middle of the highway. I picked the leg up and covered it with a tarp.

Even worse, the car driving behind the pickup was the MOTHER of the deceased, and as expected she was absolutely hysterical. Basically, this whole thing was a shit show. I go over to try and comfort the mother, and listen to her say all of these things I know she would never tell even her closest friends, and then eventually left her when her pastor showed up.

I go back to the ambulance, and find out we need to move the ambulance to make room for some incoming units (43 kids inside the bus, all needed an examination), so I hop into the back and wait for my driver to get into the rig.

About five minutes goes by, and I figure he got held up. So I think ""damn, it's a hot fucking day and that ice cream is just sitting in that fridge."" Fuck it, and I go for my big bowl of fro-yo. So I'm sitting there, quickly spooning heaps of chocolaty goodness into my mouth, when the back of the ambulance door swings open. 

15 kids, 4 cops, my boss, and the poor frantic mother just staring at me, as I shovel a big lump of ice cream into my mouth. I immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. Bus full of potentially injured children. An amputated deceased victim. The victim's mother. And I am sitting in the back of the ambulance eating ice cream like a fat, careless fuck.

I tried to recover, practically throwing the ice cream sideways and stammering out ""alright kids who wants to go for a ride?!"" or some stupid shit like that. But they couldn't hide their disapproving astonishment.

So that's how I got the nickname Ice Cream.

TL;DR: Am firefighter, was getting ice cream, got interrupted, went to car wreck with dead people, finished ice cream in the back of the ambulance while on scene, was seen by everyone"
"TIFU and found out Jello can be explosive


I wanted to Surprise my husband with banana bread this morning. So I woke up at the butt crack of dawn to get started. I have four dogs; three under a year old. I got distracted when one of them ate a shoe. I cleaned up and added baking powder, not remembering that I had already done so before the shoe incident. 

I had the ingredients in the mixer. I beat the hell out of them. I scraped the mix into the pan and into the oven it went. And the banana bread started to rise. And rise. And rise... 

It frothed over the top and began spewing over the edges, all over the heating coils. 

After calming down and clearing away the smoke, I started to clean up and decided that jello would be a nice surprise, even though it's not banana bread. 

So, I put some water in a bow and microwaved it while I cleaned up. But cleanup took longer than expected, and I didn't want the water to get cold. So I added 30 seconds and went back to cleaning. And added 30 seconds and cleaned some more. Repeat five or six times over a ten-fifteen minute period.

I finally finished cleaning and added orange jello mix to the superheated water. It fizzled a little bit while stirred, but whatever. It was 6 am and my mind was fried already. 

I read the box and decided to mix in ice cubes to help it set quicker. Ice cubes in, jello explosion out.

I was covered in scalding orange jello juice and my kitchen needed another cleaning. I called my brother (who lives a few miles away), explained the situation, and told him to take my husband out for breakfast. 

Productive day. 

I'm going back to bed.

EDIT: I am new to the Reddit world and appreciate all of your feedback. It was brought to my attention that someone may consider giving me ""Reddit Gold"". If someone feels the urge to do so, please donate the money to your local no-kill shelter instead. They need your support more than I do.

I'm very glad that my unfortunate morning brought amusement to so many of you."
"TIFU by making my wife seem like a heartless bitch to all of the people she works with.


So last night we had a conference for my wife's work. It was for a charitable foundation for children with physical disabilities. The presentation itself was an hour and a half long using Powerpoint. They trotted out the kids one by one and tried to guilt you into the inevitable when they asked for money at the end. Seriously the only thing missing was Sarah McLachlan singing ""In the Arms of an Angel"". It was just like that but with kids instead of animals.

So I was bored silly and texting my son in the Army. When I told him an hour and a half of Powerpoint he commiserated and said, ""Yup. That's every damned meeting for me!"" I showed this to my wife and she want, ""Ha!"" out loud.

Now, at that very time they were talking about another poor little kid. So it went something like this:

&gt; Presenter: This little guy was born with all of his organs on the outside instead of on the inside.
&gt; 
&gt; Wife: Ha!

Then she looked up from the text to see people in a three table radius staring at her."
"TIFU by grabbing the TV remote instead of my wallet


This happened a few months ago. I woke up in the morning and decided to go to the local petrol station to get a coffee from the Starbucks coffee machine there. So I just woke up, put some  random clothes on, grabbed my stuff and immediately and left the house.

I went the petrol station, served myself a latte from the automatically machine and took it to the cashier to pay. She said ""that will be £2.40"" I then went to get my wallet from my pocket and instead of taking out a wallet I took out my TV remote which I had picked up by mistake instead of the wallet. Then there was this moment where I just stared at the remote, then back to the cashier then again at the remote and back at the cashier while I was figuring out what was going on (I had only just woken up remember). 

Obviously I explained that I had left my wallet at home but I later realised that I never explained to the cashier why I had taken a TV remote out of my pocket ... It's possible the cashier thought I just wanted to show off my remote."
"TIFU by destroying my Aunt's entire Swarovski Crystal collection


This happened over a decade ago when I was around 9.

My siblings, cousins and I were playing hide-and-go-seek in my Aunt's fairly large living room, while the adults were doing their boring adult thing at the table along one of the walls. You know when you've played hide-and-go-seek a million times in the same house, yet by a stroke of imagination you manage to find that new spot that nobody's ever found before? Well this time, I had found it. It was the short circular table that supported my Aunt's Swarovski crystal collection. You know, the one with about 75 pieces that she's been collecting her entire life? The house's centrepiece? The one where friends would surprise her with a new thousand-dollar item every so often for decades?

Anyways. I felt like a genius for finding the spot. The table's cloth perfectly covered the table's legs. Genius. This was real estate that De Beers would be proud of. The only problem was that there was just so little room under there. So while my brother counted to 20, which probably happened over the course of a couple seconds, I scrambled under the Swarovski-ladden table and held my breath.

""20!"" And the hunt began. From one corner of the room, I hear ""No! Darn it!"" Oh, there goes Christina. From behind the piano, you could hear a dissatisfied rumbling from Gary. Amateur. Entire seconds passed in the blink of an eye. When suddenly somebody – my brother! – grabbed my foot, which was neatly protruding from beyond the table's hanging cloth. ""Gotcha!"" he cried.

That's when I decided to scare him by springing up with all my might. Except I was beneath the table, which required extra might. And that's when it happened. Before I knew it, I heard a loud crash on the floor behind me. Turning around, I saw it: all those crystal bears, elephants, monkeys, and other animals, destroyed. Some were decapitated; others suffered much more gruesome fates. Perhaps a few Siamese kittens survived; I forget. I pouted up to notice the parents mid-gasp. My aunt looked shocked and angry. I turned to my cousins – but the alibis disappeared! So I did what was natural, racing to the couch where I buried my face, crying, in the cushioniest corner, away from the world.

What would you do if some pesky kid accidentally ruins your life passion?

Well after 15 minutes of me sulking, my aunt sat down next to me. Perfect calm. And she told me this story:

""Once I was a dinner guest at a friend's house. We had a very lovely meal and a great time. But when it was time to go, I started walking out, and when I did, my foot fell right through their hallway floor! I was so embarrassed! Their floor was broken! My friends were looking at me with such disapproval and I didn't know what to say. I had ruined their home. I just felt like crying... I know exactly how you feel. And it's okay.""

She was an incredibly strong woman. Passed away some years later. May she rest in peace.

**TL;DR** Playing hide-and-go-seek when I was 9. Destroyed Aunt's entire Swarovski collection by jumping out from under the table that supported it. She showed tremendous grace in comforting me."
"TIFU by having an ugly face contest with my girlfriend.


This was about a week ago but I was at her house and we were just hanging out sitting on her bed when decided to see who could make the ugliest face. We were sort of doing a Blue Steel style reveal each time where we would make the face and then hit each other with it. It was one of the funniest things we had ever done but about 5 minutes of straight laughter in it was my turn again. I turned away and set my face with my jaw to the right and whipped my head around in the most ridiculous way I could think. My already strangely positioned jaw hit my left shoulder and my jaw became dislocated. My girlfriend just laughed hysterically for almost 30 seconds until I was able to control her and tell her I was in serious pain. We then had to go to the hospital and explain how the dumbest injury ever had occurred to a group of extremely skeptical nurses. It was not a good time.

tl;dr I tried to make a funny face and ended up dislocating my jaw"
"TIFU by lying to my boss and getting fingered by a doctor infront of my mom


 TIFU

hi reddit im gonna use a throwaway for this, im 30 so this happened 14 years ago but i can remember it like it was yesterday. this is an xpost from /r/askreddit about the stupidest reason you had a doctors visit you can find the first post in my history. here goes.

TIFU

I was 16 hung over and working at Burger King, I was supposed to open the next morning (Sunday) which meant I had to be there by 5:45 to clock in at 6 so we could open at 7. I was up partying the night before lost track of time and left the part at 4:30 in time to get home get a shower and leave for work. 

It's now 7:30am I'm in drive thru drunk as shit trying not to sleep and/or puke. Finally I take the headset off tell the manager in not feeling good and go to the bathroom. I sit on the toilet for what feels like hours but ended up only being 5 minutes. I come out of the bathroom take a ketchup packet and smear some of it into the palm of my hand and a little on my finger tips so it gives them a red after effect. I go to my manager pull her aside and tell her my stomached been in knots all morning show her my hand and tell her i was just shitting blood. This scares the woman beyond reason and she tells me to clock out. 

I go sit for a few minutes and wait for the next bus when my mother shows up crying. The manager called my mother who was my emergency contact. My mother who left her job is now standing in front of me crying asks me if I'm ok. Now I have two choices in front of me either tell the truth and let her rain holy wrath down upon me as only an angry mother could at their drunk lying 16 year old trying to get out of a hard days work. Or I can play along. 

20 minutes later I find myself in the emergency room explaining to the nurse how I was just oozing blood out of my asshole at Burger King. They rush me in to a bed and strip me naked. Sooner than I hoped this old Indian man is in my room with a rubber glove snapping into his hand looking at me, I'm stark naked bare this little hospital dress they put on me, he rolls me onto my side and sticks his finger into my brown abyss. He's poking around reaching like a child would a vending machine that ate his last quarter. He asked me if I have had any sexual activity in my bum because he can feel some tearing ( what a fucking bullshitter this doctor is I didn't bleed out of my ass) and it can usually be caused by anal penetration. I deny it my mom looks worried he gives me a note for the day off I get dressed we get to the car and the drive home is quick. 

Before we pull in to the driveway my mom asks me If im OK and how my butt feels. I tell her it's sore and she told me that's what the fuck I deserve for lying to her about drinking the night before. She knew... What a bitch.


im unsure when she figured out i was lying, it had to be after she picked me up tho because her hysterics were real when she arrived.


TL:DR
i was drunk wanted 2 leave work lied to my boss about shitting blood, my mother was called took me to the hospital and let a doctor anally probe me when she knew i was lying.

Edit:formatting
Edit2: I am a man since I didn't state it clearly."
"TIFU BY nearly cauterized my butt hole shut.


I am currently in Spain doing some work for the US military. I am staying at a hotel and they have a bidet in the restroom. I decided to use it, because well, when in Rome. I sit down and crank on the water only to have lava come out instead! The water was set on the hottest setting and it felt like the devil came out of the faucet and knocked on my unsuspecting poop shoot. It's been about 8 hours now and my butt still hurts. Hoping a night of sleep will make it feel better.

Edit: well spank my burnt ass and call me Charlie! Never could have guessed my burnt b-hole would get me so much Internet points!

Edit 2: Woke up and things seem to be decent... I will be holding off on the coffee and smokes this morning to try and delay my morning poo as much as possible.

Edit: Also for those concerned, no bleeding just tender, overall not as bad as when I scorched my ball bag with Nair...

Last update. Thanks for all the support and interest in my butt, I did poop and while tender, there was no blood so I think I'm good to go. Time to go eat some Spanish food!!"
"TIFU by trying to deep-fry a partially frozen turkey


**As per usual -  This happened 15+ years ago**

So I'll start off by saying a couple of things; first I am a Canadian and secondly I love outdoor cooking.  Don't care if it's grilling, smoking, BBQ'ing - I love it all!

So being from Canada, pre-food channel days, I was not afforded the luxuries of TV tutorials on the do's and don'ts of deep frying a turkey.  Hell, we still didn't have a decent outdoor shop in my town where I could buy a turkey fryer.  To say I didn't know what I was doing is an understatement. 

Off to eBay I go, and find a decent set up, pot, fryer basket, lifter, burner, thermometer- everything I need.  So I pay up and a couple weeks later my new purchase comes in the mail.  My wife and I host a yearly BBQ and I thought it would be the ideal time to try out my new toy.

So, day before the BBQ, I go out and buy a turkey from the store - still completely frozen.  I throw it in the fridge with my naivety kicking in and telling me it'll be thawed by tomorrow.  So the big day comes and I position the burner in our back lane (right by both our cars), and proceed to begin heating up 17L of oil.  Now, I did what I could looking up things on the internet (this was 2001 and not a lot was around back then), and did the volume of oil check with the turkey to make sure the oil wouldn't pour over the top when I put in the bird.  

Finally, with my guests arriving and sitting in my back yard watching me, the oil temperature gets up to 400 degrees F.  I go get the bird, drop it into the fry basket, hook on the handle and just drop it in all at once.

Holy. Shit.

Now I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, and somehow my brain failed to process the most basic of cooking instructions:

Oil + Water do not work well together.

The instant the still frozen parts hit the oil, the water changed to steam and created what I can only describe as a geyser of canola oil shooting out of the turkey neck hole 10 feet in the air, and raining down on me and my vehicles.

So here I am, screaming in pain as blisters develop on my face, arms and legs, oil peeling paint off our cars, and a backyard of friends witnessing this horror.

Then shit went south...........

The Pot of oil burst into flames fueled by the burner and stupidity.  I'm losing my shit at this point and determine the best course of action is to kick the pot of flaming oil over into my back lane.....and as I did so I watched burning oil flow down my lane and go directly into the sewer system.

Needless to say, the turkey was ruined, I was taken to the hospital with 2nd and 3rd degree burns, the paint on my cars peeled, and all the time my friends watched this debacle take place.

tl;dr - Tried deep frying a frozen turkey, was burnt by a geyser of boiling oil, destroyed my cars, and lit my back lane on fire.

Edit 1: Well went to bed after a night shift woke up to this. Thanks for asking how I am.  I'm not all Freddy Krueger'd up just some scarring on my arms and back of my neck but for the most part it's ok - remember I live in Canada, free health care. It had rained the night before, so there was water in the back lane which either helped the lake of fire flow so nicely but likely extinguished it upon entering our storm sewer system. I don't have any pictures of the aftermath but I wish I did 😓

I've done dozens of turkeys since then. One stupid mishap should stop you from doing something. Obviously you learn pretty quick the don't so the do's come pretty easy after. 

If you want to deep fry, use peanut oil if you can find it (I can't usually and when I do find it its well over $100 to buy it). Peanut oil imparts a nice taste whereas canola oil (my go to) just frys shit. Once turkey is thawed for a couple of days (check it) you can inject it with seasoning or brine it the day before. I do both. Pat it dry then take melted butter and baste the skin. Put some seasoning on the skin and set bird aside. Get oil up to 400 degree F (the temp will drop once the bird goes in). Put bird in frying basket, and make sure you are wearing a big goddamn glove (I wear welders gloves). Lower bird into oil about two inches then remove, then lower into oil again so bird cooks another 2 inches. Keep doing this till the bird is fully immersed. 3.5 minutes per pound and I guarantee it's one of the greatest things you will ever try. "
"TIFU by letting my mom accidentally drink my own semen (kind of NSFW)


Excuses for my bad English, I'll do my best.

This happened a couple weeks ago. I had a pretty bad cold (not any fever or anything, just headaches and a sore throat and coughing up a lot of slime) so I stayed at home from school. I decided to lay on the couch while my mom was going somewhere with a friend of her. After a couple hours I was bored so I decided to start fapping (I didn't feel that bad). I didn't have anything near me to dump my load in except a cup with a little water left in it. I decided to use it and said to myself that I would wash the cup right after I would be finished. This is where the fuckup started

After I finished I was so stupid enough to put the cup back where it was. I know that I was being stupid but I really didn't feel like coming of the couch. Then my mom comes back and starts a conversation with me. She decides that she'll be nice to me and clear the little table next to the couch. She picked up the cup and DRANK WHAT WAS LEFT. You could see on her face that the stuff she drank wasn't exclusively water and she asked what it was. I'm completely fucking shocked and I'm just able to say that it was some slime that I coughed up and spitted out. She was extremely disgusted and got pissed at me. I just wanted to kill myself that moment but I think I handled the situation pretty well by telling her that she drank some of my spittle than some of my semen.

"TIFU by flashing my entire high school


Obligatory: this was a few years ago.

My high school has a tradition that each year, the graduating class plays a game of softball against the teachers and everyone else comes out to watch.

I was never very athletic and kind of insecure about it. Also, I had never played softball in my life. So as my senior class got ready to play, I set myself a personal goal: just get to first base. Hit the ball, do everything you can to get to first base, and if you can do just that, that's enough. Nobody can laugh at you for that.

My turn comes, and I go up to bat. The first ball is pitched, I swing and miss. The second ball is pitched, and again I miss! Really getting nervous now. Finally, the third ball comes, and I hit it! -- but it is a really poor hit, and I know it will be hard for me to make it to first base.

I'm running, and I'm running, and as I get closer I realize how close it will be. I think to myself about how I've seen people on TV dive for it (or slide for it?). I've never tried this before, but I think maybe if I put in a good effort nobody will laugh at me for it. So I decide to dive for it.

I dive headfirst towards first base. I get there just after the ball does and I'm tagged out. Damn. Humiliated, I pull myself up and start trudging back to where the rest of my class is sitting. The school is sitting behind them, and I can tell a lot of people are laughing and pointing. My high school ex is staring. I think to myself ""Yea, yea, I know....""

Then I feel a breeze....

Turns out that when I dove headfirst into first base, the friction with the ground pulled both my shirt and bra down below my breasts. I was flashing the entire school, along with all the teachers.

Some friends ran up to cover me. The next day I wore a sweatshirt, and two grade 7 guys tittered that it was a day too late."
