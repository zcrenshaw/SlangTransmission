"TIFU by befriending a lobster


So this isn't really today, but rather a summary of my last couple of lobster filled days and how I made a 150 mile journey to put a lobster in the sea.

So I'm a student and since coming to university I eat a lot of fish. Like 5/6 times a week. The only way to afford this is to prepare my food from scratch - including preparing my own fish  (Â£15 salmon can feed a man for two weeks) so I'm not squeamish - It also means I have a healthy working relationship with my local fishmonger. Every single trip, he will have some wild caught, exotic, fancy, or otherwise intriguing catch. There will be a little barter, I'll probably buy it.

**Wednesday**

This day is no different, I walk in looking for some coley (great alternative to cod, please try it, sustainable), when the fishmonger is like ""ah my friend! Only the best for you? I have the special stock out back"" 

Of course I want the special stock.

So he goes out back, and brings back this little fella, beautifully blue, with just one antenna, he puts it on the table. It wiggles that little antenna at me... And in that moment, I decided that the lobster in front of me was special. I say that I'll decide if I want it tomorrow. 

I go home... distressed? I don't know why - but in those small moments I emotionally connected with a fucking lobster. I go on a panicked 2 hour frenzy (this is the middle of exam season, I should be revising) looking for tanks, looking up lobster information, trying to work out how I will hide a lobster in my room. Eventually I realise that there is no way of keeping this lobster. I try to find friends and family with tanks that have no fish, or someone that want's a pet lobster - nothing. I decide to purchase it, and try to find it a home, and if not, quickly put it down with a knife (instead of boiling, which I am confident, having read the scientific literature, causes a lobster distress and pain).

**Thursday**

*I feel at this point I should inform you that my confused girlfriend now knows I am getting a pet lobster*


Now before I go to the fishmongers, I head to the supermarket. I need supplies to transport the lobster; and if I have to put it down, it will have a nice meal before it dies.
I purchase the following

1) Sea salt

2) Ice

3) Salmon, Cod, Prawns, Broccoli, Carrots (stuff that the internet said lobsters like)

4) Tea towels

5) Apple juice (to help me with the emotional stress I'm currently in)

I go to pick it up, the fishmonger (ex-chef) asks if I want it boiled, I say no, and that I will cook it myself. He gives me seaweed to keep him comfy and hydrated in. I take it home. Turns out the lobster is male. I name him Qui-Gon because there's always a bigger lobster. I take apart my plastic drawers, and pop him in one of them. Along with the sea weed and food. I play some underwater sounds I downloaded on my phone. I take pictures and post pictures of him on pet sites on facebook looking for a home and/or a tank - my third plan, was now to house him at my parent's home. 

*At this point my family knows I own a pet lobster*

Oh, I have a 24 hour bug and feel very very sick? Fantastic.

Wait? It's Thursday - I'm meant to be making the two hour journey back home today - I have to be back to go to Comic Con on Friday morning.

But this little guy needs a home. Being in a tank isn't good. He needs the ocean.

Anyways, me and Qui-Gon have a nice day. I work out a plan to get him to the sea. I'm too ill to make the 6 hour journey to Skegness. However, I can make an hour and a half journey to my hometown, and my friend has offered to drive me the other hour and a half to Southend the following evening.

I put him on the side, fill the box with ice, place the first teatowel over the ice, then put him back in the box with some food, then food and seaweed. Finally i put the second teatowel over the box to protect him from the sun. I've made up artificial saltwater to the correct concentrations to splash him with (not great, but should keep him hydrated).

Lots of train delays, tram delays, bus delays. Should be home at 8, I get back at 10.30. Me and Qui-Gon made a lot of friends - apparently you get attention when carrying a lobster on a 110 mile train journey. He's eaten some fish, seems happy. No signs of stress such as tail thrashing. 

I get him home and put the box back in the fridge. He seems a happy lobster. I check on him before bed. Happy lobster.

**Friday** 

I wake up at like 7. I check on Qui-Gon. He is responsive and seems okay, I splash him a little more. I head to London

Comic Con stuff - whilst filled with anxiety over his wellbeing.

I get back, my friend informs me that there is a fish center that can take him, about 30 miles away - and keep him in suitable conditions. I agree on the condition that he will be released in Cornwall (where he first came from).

Sadly, when I got home, he was unresponsive - after trying to get him to do stuff, gently brushing his eyes, unclipping his claws, etc. It's clear he is dead. I'm legitimately upset. A fully grown, 6ft, bearded man, may have cried over a lobster.

However, he did eat the salmon and cod, and displayed no signs that he had thrashed or tried to escape, or was other wise stressed. It seems that he died whilst numbed from the cold of the fridge, hopefully asleep.

I wrapped him in the seaweed so it would be like home, and went to the nearest lake, and eased him into the water. He didn't last long enough to get him proper help.

I literally spent Wednesday-Saturday with my life revolving around looking up information, caring for, seeking help for, and transporting, a lobster. I do not like animals, I do not want pets.

Qui-Gon was a special fella.

TLDR: Avid meat/fish eater. Emotionally bonded with a lobster in a fishmongers. Went on 120 mile (193km) journey in an attempt to return him to the sea. He died, now I am sad. However he had a nice couple of days eating fish and making friends.

"TIFU like, REALLY FU, by getting a drink of water


This post is purely out of a desire to take my mind off the pain.

Holy Jesus Lord.

So you know the drill.  Got out of bed in the middle of the night, gotta drain the little u/Trussed_Up, gotta wet my thirst.

I usually keep a glass beside my bed to drink from whenever I wake up.  Was carrying that back to my bed when **FUCKING WHAM**.  I slip like a bender's first time on ice.

First thing I think of was ""oh fucking shit, my favourite nightglass just smashed on the ground and now I'm covered in glass.

Second thought was ""OH FUCKING SHIT, THAT'S NOT WHERE MY KNEE IS SUPPOSED TO BE"".

I looked at my own leg in the dark of the 3:30 am Canadian morning.

My kneecap was completely backwards.  It was, to the letter of the goddamn word so I better not hear about it, **LITERALLY** BACKWARDS.

My kneecap was underneath my knee.

Now I ain't no pansy, so I took one look at it and threw up.

Then I lay there for probably 1 or 2 *minutes* contemplating how much I loved baby Jesus.

Since there was nothing for it, I did the most insane thing I've ever done, and in one motion, grabbed my own kneecap, straightened out my knee, and shoved that motherfucker back in place....

Except I missed apparently.  And it went over to the other side of my knee.  Cue baby Jesus again.

Now I've played enough hockey to know that sonofabitch needs to be in the right spot before you move.  So I grabbed it, praying like father Dennis would be proud, and put it back in place with both hands.

The first thing your mind goes to is this. https://youtu.be/-kcOpyM9cBg?t=440

The second thing is HOLY FUCK I HOPE THAT'S NOT GONNA AFFECT MY LIFE

Couldn't really move.  Called my clinic since I didn't want to jam up 911, and now I'm writing this to take my mind off it while I wait.

TLDR:  When you're 99% asleep and draining the dragon, use the 1% brainpower to WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING

**The post clinic EDIT:**  Well that was painful as fuck.  The waiting that is.  4 hours or so.  The knee hurt too, but oddly not nearly as much as you would expect.  As long as there's zero weight on it, it's really not the most painful injury I've had.  Any weight makes me want to yell though, so definitely keeping off it.

The doctor was surprised to find in the x-rays that I don't seem to have any bone damage.  He was *not surprised* to find I likely have fairly extensive muscle and tendon damage (hard to tell with the swelling).  I got a loose brace, a whack of painkiller/anti-inflamatory pills, crutches, a new ice-pack wrap thing, and a whole bunch of physio to go to.

All because chamberpots went out of style."
"TIFU by hiptossing my girlfriend.


Obligatory ""this happened a while ago, not actually today.""

On this particularly beautiful day, my girlfriend and I had decided to celebrate our recent move to a new town, and my new job. We went to the first place we thought of, Chili's. Why? I don't know. Don't judge us.
As I'm sure it happens with many of us, Chili's has a way of...cleansing the body. For whatever reason, it was not agreeing with me that day. Not even five minutes into the drive home, my guts dropped. Not just a little, either. I was about to burn a hole through my seat.

Sensing my urgency, my girlfriend decided that she wasn't going to play nice. To this day, I don't know what possessed her to impede my inevitable and foul journey to the land of porcelain, but she did. I unlocked our door and went up the steps two at a time, carefully managing the muscles in my ass to ensure that I didn't...give away my position. My girlfriend was also on her way up the stairs behind me, and I'm not trying to catch a manslaughter charge if she passed through a cloud of that.

I was two steps into the living room when she called to me, likely from the pits of hell in which she came. ""Judoka! Come back real quick!"" She hissed. Being the loving man that I am, I turned around. She made it to the top of the stairs and I watched her mouth curl into a smile. ""I love you!"" She cheered, way too excited for the situation. She wrapped her arms around me and hugged me.

""Alright. I love you, too."" I replied as I began to turn back towards the bedroom and bathroom door. She didn't let go. In fact, she tightened her grip. Why was this happening to me? ""Darlin, let me go. I have to poop. NOW!"" I said, with strong urgency in my voice. She merely laughed in response.

I've been doing martial arts for a long time. Taekwondo, Karate, Boxing, Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiujitsu, and JUDO. I was a cop and a correctional officer. I had to escape. How did I escape before my bowels did the same?

I tucked my arm in close and squeezed it up between my chest and hers, and quickly snaked over her arm and grabbed a hold of her tricep. As I took a step back towards the bedroom door, I pulled her with me. She was off balance, as is necessary for a good Judo throw, in this case, a modified tsurikomi goshi. My other arm went up behind her and grabbed her shoulder. I flared my elbow out to lift her arm and start some rotation, furthering her off balance. At the last second, I dropped my hips under hers and popped my ass backwards, completing the throw.

She landed squarely on her back, and I heard the air leave her lungs, but I didn't turn around. I had a mission to accomplish, and she made the unfortunate mistake of standing between me and my dignity.
Sorry, darlin. She didn't talk to me for almost a week after that.

TL;DR - I ate bad food, had an immediate need for bowel evacuation, my girlfriend impeded me, and was judo tossed to the ground for her infraction upon my dignity.

EDIT: Not that this is still relevant, but I would like to let everyone know that the entire point of this is that I hiptossed my girlfriend, which is wrong, and rightfully caused a brief period of strife between us. Let's calm down now and move along with our lives."
"TIFU by trying to remove a tick from my dog


This just happened, but here's some backstory:

On mother's day, we went to my brother'sâ place up in the mountains, and his dog and ours went running through the woods.

Later, I pointed out a bug crawling across the floor.

""Oh, gross. A tick."" my nephew says, before smashing it into oblivion.

""Yeah, you might want to check your dog when you get home. They're likely the ones who brought them in.""

So we get home and scour our girl for ticks, because one of those little shits is the last thing we want. But dammit, dogs have a lot of fur! How the hell am I supposed to find one, even if it's there?

So we called it good, and figured if one shows up, we'll notice.

Fast forward to today.

As we were getting in bed for the night, I noticed she was licking a spot just inside her hind leg. Also, she had seemed more lethargic than usual lately.

I thought, 'Maybe we should do another tick check, just in case.'

Our room is kinda dark, so I turn on the flashlight on my phone, and have her roll over so I can check the spot she was licking. Sure enough, I see this little black fucker attached her belly.

Fuck.

I run into the bathroom and grab the tweezers. I go back to her, hold her down, and try as I might to pinch that bitch off. 

But, shit! It's embedded deep!

And my poor girl is yelling and crying and wriggling like crazy!

This sucks!

So I get her up on the bed and turn on the overhead light so I can see it better.

That's when I notice another tick.

Fuck!

And another!

And...another...

...and they're all lined up...

That's when I realize, they weren't ticks.

They are her nipples.

Fuck.

TL;DR was trying to de-tick my dog, almost de-nippled my dog.

Good thing dogs are forgiving.

Sorry girl.

Edit: To clarify, her nipple is fine, albeit mildly tweaked.

Also, I forgot to address the lethargy comment. She's getting older, and my wife and I started running outside again for the summer. I was just being cautious (maybe a bit too much so).

And yes, I know I'm stupid.

"TIFU by sticking my finger in the lawn mower while it was running


So I have two lawns, one scabby, lumpy old one behind the house, I and a new perfect lawn rolled out last summer in front of the house. The new lawn needed cutting several times a week to turn out nice, so the old lawn was forgotten. 

Well, today I finally went to cut the old one, where the grass was knee high. I finished up, but noticed grass wasn't spitting out anymore.

Yes, I was an idiot and used my finger to clear clogged grass from the side outlet with the blade at full speed. This isn't some little electric mower, but a 173cc 4stroke with a mulcher knife.

But you know what? I'm off to buy a lottery ticket, because all I got was a numb finger tip and a nail that was instantly blue in some places, guess it will fall off in a few days. But I'm just extremely lucky to even have a finger tip to grow a new nail on.

TL;DR: was an idiot, got away with it with just a blue nail and totally numb fingertip.

EDIT: The much requested pic - it aint much, but you can see some blueing of the nail(no that's not dirt, and no I haven't cut my nail since the incident because it hurts), and a small cut below the nail:

"TIFU by peeing on my cat


As per usual, this was actually yesterday.


My cat is somewhat fixated about me using the toilet. Whenever i take a pee he comes rushing, stands up on his back legs, putting his front paws on the seat and reach his head just watch my fluids hit the surfice, excitingly waiting for the scarry flush to come, wich he is just barely brave enough to stare in the eye. Same goes with #2 wich he stubbornly tries to witness by jumping up on the seat just behind me, just to be chased away the very second he gets up to avoid the REAL disaster. He then just sits there, thoroughly examining the toiletpaper, where it goes, how and why. And then the great flush strikes again. Super interesting.

However.
After a long day of work i decide to relax a bit with a few beers, a pizza and some tinder-swiping. After an hour or so my bladder makes its presence felt, so i take a walk towars the loo, seeing the face of curiosity in the corner of my eye, stalking my steps. The beer has already taken me past caring, and as i stand up i realize the presure is greater than i anticipated, so with a bit of haste i unzip my pants, aim and shoot. 

Now, im a millennial, so im all grown up to adapting the toiletbreaks to the DEAD-time between rounds in video games, making sure im always prepared to pwn some noobs the moment i rezip, regardless the respawn time. I pee hard. I pee with force. I pee to win.

It's all in slowmotion. 
As my wrath is airborne i feel a tingle to my leg and i see the head of Inspector McKitty reaching up under my badonkadonk, streching that little head higher and higher to get a view of the full interior of the toilet and BAM.
The beam hits him dead centre in the back of his head, but he's still in motion upwards, denching his neck and upper back in well consentrated piss. The spalsh soaks the the cat, the room and me.

Suddenly time no longers move slowly.

Neither does the cat. Obviously considering this an assault on my behalf he runs away from me with fear into the livingroom, dripping.
Pissdripping cat in the furniture is bad news, so i run after him, scaring him up even more. Up on the sofa, dinner table, carpet, sofa again. As i get desperate to stop this sprinkler of pee, i yell higher, wave my arms more clearly making it worse. The chase goes into the the bedroom. 
ohgodnotthebed.jpg
In UNDER the bed for hiding. On the bed i see my powerpoint presentation-remote, with built in laser-dot. God bless.

Here kitty kitty. 
The predator sees its prey and leaps. The uncatchable prey made of photons takes its escape into the restroom, the dripping beast follows - into the shower and boom. The cat is locked in behind doors of glass. Finally. Time stops.


As i look down i see the sad face of a cat behind the glass door. I see pee in the entire restroom, a wet trail leading out to the middle of the living room where, judging by the formation and consentration of drops, most of it were shaken off, yet a small trail, initially accompanied by fading paw prints, goes a few laps around the room.

I burst into laughter, grab a rag and start the clean up. 



TL;DR
Curious cat puts his head in my pee-beam, gets soaked and in panic running around all over the place, sprinkling my apartment in pee. As i try to catch him i scare him up, making it all worse until i lure him back into the restroom with a laserpointer.

"TIFU by turning a strobe light on during a party.


**As told by Rivy**

It was October my junior year of college and per usual, my frat had a Halloween party that was hosted 
at my house.  Everyone was dressed up accordingly. There were goblins, vampires, slutty cats, slutty dogs, slutty sluts, characters from movies like Grease and Star Wars, one dude was a hobbit, another dude was the âFuck her right in the pussyâ guy from all those youtube videos.

I was dressed up as a medieval knight which came with the hood, fake chainmail, a sword, the whole nine. On my chest were the words âA Knight to Rememberâ. When people came up to me and asked,

âHey Rivy, why are you a âknight to rememberâ?

I would immediately lift my gown to the side to reveal a three foot long plush penis accompanied with a saggy set of balls.

I waved the fucking thing around like a flag, chased my friends with it, shrieked when it got caught in a door and plopped in on the beer pong table to distract my opponents from hitting cups. It was a riot and everyone had a good laugh.

Later on in the night, many more people ended up coming through than predicted so I needed to get everything poppinâ. The living room was the dance floor and the main area everyone hung out in so I had to think of something cool to get the juices flowing. In the back of the room, I saw that one of my big strobe lights was there but not on. I plugged it in, flipped the switch, and everyone cheered at the rapidly blinking lights as they flashed throughout the room. 

I danced for a few minutes before heading to the kitchen to grab another beer. During my travels, I saw my frat brother, Jafar (not his real name) sitting in a chair with perfect posture staring blankly into space. I asked him if he wanted a beer. No response.

âAre you alright, bud?â I said as I pat him on the shoulder.

No response.

I waved the plush penis around.

Still no response.

I looked over at my friends who are sitting across from me and they said heâs been like that for the last few minutes. 

All of sudden I heard the loudest scream I think Iâve ever heard in my life. It sounded like a man being held down by gang of demons as satan slowly inserts centipedes inside his urethra. 

I turned around to see Jafar on the floor shaking and screaming. The whole party stopped and turned to look at this kid wildly seizing. The music gets turned off, lights go on, and a bunch of us approach Jafar to try and help. 

Then it dawns on me.

Jafar is a photosensitive epileptic and my dumbass forgot and turned a strobe light on.  

We comforted him as best as we could and made sure he wouldn't injure himself or anyone near by. I noticed a small puddle of blood forming behind Jafarâs head so he must have hit it on the ground. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

Obviously, we called an ambulance and rapidly started cleaning up the house of any illegal substances just incase the cops were to come too. In five minutes what went from a house being riddled with beer cans, cups, trash, drugs, etc., turned into the cleanest itâs ever been. EVERY person in attendance helped clean and throw stuff away. 

The paramedics arrived and begin to address the situation. Jafar finally settled down, and talked to medics. He said he was fine but still had to go to the hospital. 

One paramedic asked what happened and me, still dressed in my costume with cock and balls dangling said âYea, some asshole turned a strobe light on.â

In the end, Jafar was alright but needed some stitches and time off from class. The party got broken up early and everyone went home. Some people were pissed at me for not owning up to my mistake, but I was too nervous to admit to almost seriously hurting, maybe even killing, my friend. 

**TL;DR: Had a halloween party my junior year of college. Turned on a strobe light to make everything better. Forgot my friend was an epileptic and he seizes in the middle of the party. Paramedics come and take him to the hospital.** 


**Edit:** Wow, what an amazing turn out. I'm glad most of you enjoyed the story! I'm more appreciative, however, to the people that commented on the seriousness of epilepsy, in this case, photosensitive epilepsy. It just goes to show you how good times can shift downward in a matter of seconds.  

Just for those who are interested, here is an image of the costume I wore that night: http://imgur.com/a/brrpl

"TIFU by thinking I was dying and scheduled a colonoscopy. (NSFW?)


This actually happened a fortnight ago (it's kind of gross, and the rules stated that bodily discharge-related stories should wait until the weekend, so... I also tagged it as NSFW just in case it's too gross. Better safe than sorry?), so I've been in panic-mode every since.

A week or so ago I went to the toilet in the morning for my regular... y'know, bowel movement, and after standing up I looked down into the bowl and saw what can only be described as A BLOODY NIGHTMARE. It looked like someone had been murdered in the toilet. Like, there was blood. Red coloured water all swirling around in the bowl. Cue the start of my panic and stress. I decided to give it a few days and see if it happened again, and low and behold it happened the next day as well.

It was my day off the following day, so I planned to see a doctor, but that morning every seemed fine. Totally normal. No scene straight out of a horror movie in my toilet bowl. The week went on, and bam, it happened again. I went to the doctor. Totally, completely stressed. My doctor ordered a colonoscopy and I began the long process of working myself up into a state of stress.

Yesterday (four days before the colonoscopy), I was at work when I suddenly realised what I'd eaten the day before the first incident. BEETS. FUCKING BEETS. The thing is, beets aren't common at all in the country I live in, so I haven't had much experience with them recently. I ate a beet salad, holy shit! And after that beet salad I'd enjoyed them so much that I bought more beets from the supermarket. I was so happy with my beets.

I bought more beets yesterday and ate them, and yeah... it happened again. Now I probably have a stress ulcer from thinking and panicking about it constantly.

SO JUST A NOTE TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS BEETS - PLEASE DON'T FREAK OUT IF YOU NOTICE WHAT SEEMS TO BE BLOOD IN THE TOILET. IT COULD JUST BE THE DAMN BEETS.

Sidenote: I also had to go back to the doctor's office and explain what might have happened, so that was a fun and not at all embarrassing trip. The receptionist looked at me like I was a total idiot. Which I am.

TL;DR: I ate beets and didn't realise the dye would colour your poo, thought I was bleeding, freaked out, scheduled a colonoscopy, wept."
"TIFU by taking the wrong medication


My life is full of fuck ups so I figure I would post another one on here. Obligatory this happened ten years ago when I was in high school.

I've had a problem with chronic migraines my entire life and occasionally before school I would take a dose of fioricet (basically a pain killer with caffeine used for migraines) and head to school pain free. I was up all night playing PS3 and only got a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My head was throbbing so I took my meds and drove to class. The teacher started her lesson when I realized I left my textbook in my car. I excused myself and walked towards my vehicle, and grabbed my book. 

Next thing I remember is waking up in the middle of the front office handcuffed to a chair. Belligerently mumbling and trying to rip myself out of the chair. I thought the security guard was attacking me and I began to scream and kick my feet at him. He started yelling in my ear ""What did you take, what drugs are you on?!. All I remember is yelling ""Fuck you, get me out of this fucking chair"". I stood up dragging the chair behind me as I tried to leave out the front door of the office. He grabbed me and stuck me in the principals office and stood in front of the door. They went out and started searching my car for drugs. He came in with my pipe and put it on the desk. An ambulance got called and they drove me to the hospital to have my stomach pumped. 

Fast forward to the hospital, they got me in the bed and have hooked up a bag of saline to flush the drugs out of my system. Out of no where I snapped back into reality. I started asking why the hell I was at the hospital when my mom showed up with a couple pill bottles. She counted them out and they realized that I had taken an ambien in my sleepy stupor instead of my migraine medicine. The ambien kicked in at the exact time I had grabbed my books. 

Next day at school, I was called into the principals office to discuss the incident. I was fully ready to be expelled but he was really cool about it. The conversation went like this 

""I'm just happy your alive, I have never seen someone try to fight a security guard. You know we found you standing in the middle of the parking lot with your book in your hand just staring at your car""

All I had to do was write a written apology to the security guard. He laughed about it and every time he saw me he'd be like ""woah watch out man, don't kick me alright?!""

TLDR : Wrong meds turned me into a ninja"
"TIFU by getting distracted by a cute girl walking by


This is from a few years ago when I was at university. I used to ride a scooter to uni as it was cheap and easy to park (Vespa type scooter).

One lovely summer day I had just left home, only got a minute   down the road and I noticed a rather attractive girl walking down the footpath. I had a quick glance and looked back just in time to see the side of a car before I slammed into it.  
 
An old guy had done an illegal u-turn across the road in front of me and I t-boned him in the rear door, wrecked the door, put my arm through the window, then fell back onto the road.

Ended up getting some road rash, stitches and very sore, no broken bones luckily. And the pretty girl? She called the ambulance for me and that was the end of that.

TLDR; Looked at a pretty girl while riding scooter, t-boned a car."
"TIFU by making a ""bad"" call at first, which led to a massive fight, cops/ambulances, and the tournament getting cancelled


ike most of the TIFUs this didn't happen today. I was watching some baseball and got a flashback to something that happened to me many many years ago.

I had quit playing baseball but I wanted to be around the game on some level so I thought I would give umpire a shot. Its easy as shit right? ð

The league has me do some initial paperwork, watch some film, do a quiz, interview, etc. No big deal, I do well and the head umpire tells me that there is going to be a tball game and I should show up there to start my hands on training. It's slow, nobody keeps score, if I fuck up it doesn't matter at all.

I show up a bit earlier, there is an all star tournament (13-14 year olds) going on so I decide to watch a game to kill some time. The umpire there is all by himself and he's stalling a bit to see if his other umpires will show up. Parents are going crazy, umpire then spots me in my brand new uniform. Calls me over, begs me to help him, I explain that I really don't know what I'm doing since I'm training. He tells me it's ok since his other umpires should be showing up and he only wants another set of eyes mostly.

Fuck it. YOLO. I got this.

Things go pretty smoothly. Nothing crazy happens for a while, then we get to the last inning....

One of the players lays down a beautiful bunt, the catcher throws it to first and just barely gets the runner out. Easy enough call.

The Coach of the team that got called out goes up to the umpire screaming that the first baseman's foot wasn't touching the bag, so he should be safe. Other parents from that team start yelling at us because they also agree with the coach. The other teams parents start arguing with those parents. The umpire then decides to throw out that coach. That's when shit went down. The coach goes crazy, leaves the field says something to one of the parents, that parent doesn't like it so he punches the coach in the mouth and knocks him the fuck out. Other parents notice and now everyone wants to throw punches. 

Basically it got into full on riot mode, cops got called out, umpire calls the game off, the tournament gets cancelled, ambulances take a few people to the hospital, I think four people got arrested. It gets on the local news, even got a few mentions in national news if I'm not mistaken. I found a link to an old newspaper article talking about the incident, I would show you guys but it has my name and I really don't feel like connecting my name to my account. 

Did I make the right call? I'm pretty sure that I did but the reality is that in my inexperience I wasn't in the best position to see all of the moving parts.

This little incident led to a lot of changes. Games wouldn't start without a full crew, had more in depth training before allowing anybody to be an umpire, had more security/cops on hand when there was a tournament, had a few umpires on standby, etc.

I never umped another game again

TL;DR : I had no training to be an umpire, got to be an umpire for an important game. Coaches/parents didn't like my call. It got crazy, a massive fight happened which led to cops/ambulances/drama and it got this whole tournament cancelled.  "
"TIFU by absentmindedly throwing my phone into the garbage and having to hitch hike outside a state prison. [Medium]


Early this morning, 1 A.M. ish, I boarded a Greyhound bus headed to Los Angeles. Along the way one of the stops is in Blythe, California. When the bus pulls into Blythe, I'm tired as fuck because I didn't get any sleep. But it's 6 A.M. and I'm hungry. Across the street is a Burger King. I buy some pancakes and a breakfast burrito, and then sit down a little ways away from the bus, on the curb, to eat my food. 

Clearly, I misjudged how much time I had because next thing I know I see the driver marching up the steps of the bus. In the rush to not get left behind, I throw whatever trash I had into a nearby bin, and stuffed my wallet/phone/headphones into my pocket, or so I thought.

20 minutes into the bus ride, I reach into my pocket for my phone, only to grab a handful of breakfast burrito wrapper. ffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkk. My phone is $300, and is housed in a wallet case (with all my ID, cards and cash). The bus ticket was $40. No brainer. I tell the driver to let me off the bus and he drops me off at the next exit. By the time we get there, I'm about 30 minutes from Blythe.

So I'm out there in the middle of nowhere, with all my bags, no phone or ID. The only way back is to hitch hike. Many many cars go by, a couple honk, none stop. Eventually, a big fat semi truck decides to pick me up. It's pretty beat up, looks kinda old, and has cardboard covering up the sun roof. I'm not sure, I think he was Eastern European, ~50ish guy.

Trucker: ""You need ride?""

Me: ""Yea, I need to get to Blythe, just down the road.""

Trucker: ""Okay, come on.""

Me: ""Thanks for stopping, a lot of people went by before you.""

Trucker: ""Well, you are next to prison. It is illegal to pick up hitch hikers here, but you don't look like the criminal type. I can tell.""

Me: ""What.""

He takes me back to Blythe, and he's honestly one of the friendliest men I've ever met. Sure enough, after a little digging, I found my phone in the garbage. I bought a new ticket to get to LA from Blythe, and I'm chilling at Burger King right now.

Thank you trucker guy! Saved me many miles of walking in the desert with heavy bags and no water!

tl;dr Threw my phone in the garbage. Had to go back and get it. Friendly trucker guy saved me excruciating walk in the desert."
