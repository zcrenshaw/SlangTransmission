"TIFU by unintentionally taking the train home during my lunch break


My intention was to go to the train station to renew my season ticket but my body was on auto-pilot and went straight past the barriers, checked for the next available train and got on it. Realised that I was not meant to actually leave on a train when I looked around and the train wasn't as jam-packed as it usually is. Tried to make it out of the train but unfortunately did not make it. Am waiting at the next station now to return to work....and hopefully to renew my season ticket on my way there...

Update:  Thanks for all the comments.  Nice to see fellow mindless numpties out there. 

Just to update you all - I made it back to work in time, but as I got back to my station the queue to the ticket counter was painfully long... so long that I got worried I would switch to auto-pilot mode again and hop on the train once I get my ticket!  Luckily I didn't and made it back in time but without lunch, I pretty much functioned on auto-pilot mode for the rest of the day!"
"TIFU by smoking a joint.


So I'm literally writing this about 30 minutes after it happened,

So this morning I'm thinking I'm going to smoke a small joint before I go into work to deal some minor stress (dad just had a heart attack this morning) so I'm running late thanks to the awful choice to smoke a joint, as I realise I wasn't going to get to the train station in time I spent £10 on a taxi there,

So I get to the train station and buy my ticket (£6.80) and jump on the train ready to not be late for work!

So what happens? Because I'm so fucking baked I leave my ticket and the receipt on the train... get to the barriers and I can't find the bloody thing, at which point I ask an attendant if I'm able to re buy my ticket and he tells me ""yes but you're going to have to pay a £20 fine for traveling without a ticket as well"" as annoying as this is I can't do much but agree, so I pay, now my journey is at £33.60 so far, I then ask if I can have my ticket so I can return back from work later and I'm told ""no you will have to buy another one"" 

So after this costly shitstorm of a travel fare I get into work and explain my shitty morning to my manager and that I'm going to need to take tomorrow off to see my dad in hospital,

I then find out that I have booked today and tomorrow off about 2 weeks ago.

TIFU..

TL;DR

Got high, late for work, paid an expensive taxi, lost train ticket on train, got fined, had to buy a new one as well, didn't even have to be at work today, the journey totalled £40.40."
"TIFU by smoking cat feces.


So me and a friend were going to go smoke some weed outside as his wife won't let us do it in the house. But it is a rather chilly day here in Missoula, so we went to a large shed connected to the side of the house. It was normally lit with a shop light, but my friend had taken it out earlier to work on his car. He went off to get the light while I loaded the bowl. He was taking his sweet time so I went to take a hit and realized I had dropped the dense nugget of weed on the ground. I picked it up and reloaded it, and took a big rip. I didn't get anything from it so I broke it up a little bit with my fingers. Hit it again and I got smoke but it tasted foul. I chalked it up to this being some old stuff I found in the dresser. I rip it a third time and get a huge cloud that makes me gag. About then my friend comes in and plugs in the shop light. He points at the floor ""Hey there's some weed on the ground"". I look down,  see the weed, see the pipe, see the pile of old dry cat shit and realized what I had done.




TLDR: It was dark and I smoked cat shit.


edit-Hey front page now everyone knows I'm an asshole.

edit #2-As long as a lot of people are reading this I wanted to say peace and love to everyone no matter who you voted for."

"TIFU trying to be a nice person


This morning we had guests at camp that were lactose intolerant so my manager decides to get the guy some soy milk out of her own pocket, I have never had soy milk before, never tasted it and have never seen what it looks like outside the box

This is where the fuck up comes in, I ask her if I can please pour some into a cup for myself to try, I do and In my head I'm thinking ""what the fuck man, shit looks disgusting"" so chunky and thick, it just looked awful, so I go ahead and begin to drink it and that's when it hit me, anyone who drinks soy milk is not fucking human and clearly lacks the sense of taste 

I realize that because I have started I have to finish it, I mean my manager bought this out her own pocket and I can't be wasteful and throw it away, I don't want to be rude either so I just go ahead and down that fucker, my life flashes before my eyes but I carry on drinking it, man I swear I even had to wipe away a few tears. 

Few moments later my manager walks to me and said ""I thought you wanted some"" I say to her that I have already taken, she then points to show me the box is still closed, I then point to the box I drank from and she bursts out laughing, ladies and gentlemen I had drank only god knows how old soy milk that was standing for only the heavens know how long, and I drank that demon down like my life depended on it 

EDIT: decided to give a TL;DR because of certain complainers, read the post. "
"TIFU by putting my shit in my ear


[UPDATE](https://redd.it/5cu36m)

Yesterday I was listening to music at home when I was hit with the uncontrollable urge to take a massive dump. So I charged to the bathroom down the hall, did what I needed to do, and flushed. 

When I got up to wash my hands, my earbuds fell out of my ears and hit the bottom of the toilet bowl with a terrifying thump. 

I panicked, because I have a history of destroying my earbuds in magnificent ways. Without thinking, I pulled the earbuds out of the water using the chord that was still attached to my phone and stuck one of them in my right ear to test if they still worked. They did, and I was relieved, until I wasn't. 

Realizing my fuck up as soon and the earbud squished into place, I yanked it out and started washing my ear out in shame. I had just put something that was in a toilet bowl that was just full of my crap just seconds ago into my poor ear. 

I decided to call it a night, and I woke up this morning with a splitting headache, fever, and my ear was burning. So I realized that it must be infected. 

TL;DR I'm never going to hear the end of this shit. 

Update: Holy shit front page! I woke up this morning feeling a lot better, the fever is gone but I still have a bad headache. Doctor's appointment is scheduled for later today. 

Edit: Read through the comments, and just wanted to say that the fever that I had yesterday was very small. I've also had was I think is a cold for the past week, and the fever was most likely caused by that. I just took my temperature after the shitty incident, and that's what I attributed it to first. 
Leaving for the doctor in a couple of hours."
"TIFU by letting my drunk friend sleep on my floor


So we were both seriously wasted, and he lives far away so I said he could spend the night with me. Nothing particularly unusual, I've let him sleep on the couch at my place before, but this time there was no free furniture so he slept on the floor. 

Before he KOed for the night he guzzled down some water to stop the hangover. Then we both went to sleep.

At about 6am I hear a rustling, and I see him walking around the room. I try to ignore it and turn over. The next thing I know he's taking off his pants, and then he starts pissing all over my bed with me in it.

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING DUDE??!""

He looks at me like I've inconvenienced him somehow. He shrugs and says ""I wasn't aiming for you"". Then he walks over to the other side of the room and opens my closet and starts pissing in it.  

And well. My room is covered in his piss."
"TIFU by squatting on the toilet


This happened a few months back. I usually poop at work cause I don't get much time in the morning at home and am usually in a hurry. This day, I wasn't particularly feeling well. So I sit down on a toilet at office and find that I actually can't force the shit out. So I decide to put my legs up and squat on the seat, as I know that helps with bowel movement. Now, this toilet is not on the floor but actually attached to the back wall. As it turns out, the putty and plaster holding it to the wall is pretty bad and as I, rather uncomfortably try to force out a doodie, squatting on the rather narrow toilet seat, the stupid thing breaks loose from the wall. So I'm sitting there on the floor with ceramic pieces all around me, a few minor cuts in my ass and hands covered in toilet water, while more water splashing my back from the opening on the wall. Thankfully no shit was present in the toilet. A couple of people started banging on the door asking if I'm all right. I told them the toilet broke. One of the kind blokes called a janitor who handed me a rug with which I cleaned myself the best I could, put on my pants and walked out with an ashamed look on my face. My manager and co-workers got a good laugh and I was allowed to take the rest of the day off and get myself sorted. No one who isn't reading this knows that I was squatting on the toilet.


Edit: Reading through the comments, I realise I got off extremely lucky. From here onwards, I shall always check the integrity of a toilet before taking a shit in it.    
Also, I took my shoes off before squatting, because I had to take off my pants, I don't see how anyone could sqaut and poop with their pants on!!"
"TIFU by donating $60 to Goodwill.


Last fall, I put on my jacket and inside the pocket I find the gift-to-yourself that forgetful people often do, a folded up $20 bill. Years ago finding a forgotten bill in the pocket of a par of jeans would mean an exciting day of thinking of what to do with the windfall. Usually it meant a case of beer for the lads. For today's me, it kicks off my day in a brighter mood which inevitably positively affects the rest of my day. So once spring rolled around, I thought I would gift my future self by hiding a $20 bill in three separate coats. As it started to grow chilly again, I decided to purchase a new, better coat for the winter. Also on the decision list was to donate 3 coats that I had worn forever to Goodwill as they were still in great shape. Today, I found a bill in my jean pocket that gave me an idea to hide more bills for future me. Present me eventually realized what past me had already done, and now the donation receiver at Goodwill probably just had a great day. 

Edit: It sounds like the cash will either go to a good cause, or be found by someone who may need it. I certainly will not call for it. "

"TIFU by trying to ruin my vision


So this fuck up actually happened happened today, going against usual TIFU fashion. I'm currently in the Philippines taking welding courses in order to get certifications to take back to the states. I honestly suck at it but that's bedsides the point. I had just gotten done grinding down my work piece and I make my way to a work booth to begin my weld. I should preface this by stating that I always wear headphones during class to cancel out some of the noise, so I'm thoroughly distracted most days. I strike the rod (giggity) against the piece and get started, all is well I'm really not paying attention. I lift up my mask and grab a tool to chip away the slag and I notice that I can't focus correctly at what I'm staring at. I close my eyes for a bit, does nothing, so I close my mask and try with that and it helps some. I restart my weld after cleaning away the slag as best as I can. At this point I'd paused my music and after about five seconds I notice the arc is much brighter than it is normally and I realize my fuckup. My mask is auto darkening like many of my classmates, except I can adjust a few settings; delay, sensitivity, and more importantly, darkness. After grudging my piece down earlier I forget to turn the knob back from grind to a higher darkness setting, giving my retinas a good tan in the process. 

TLDR; distracted fucker can't turn a knob, almost cooks his eyeballs"
"TIFU by forgetting how Google Docs works while applying for jobs.


I've been looking for a job for the past two weeks, and I found about nine places to which I wanted to apply. For each, I wrote a nice introduction email, attached my resume and a cover letter to it from Google Docs, and submitted it. All well and good, or so I thought. 

After I wrote my introduction email for the ninth potential job, I opened my one and only copy of my cover letter and tailored it to the specific job I was applying for, as I had done the previous eight times. 

It was only after I sent the email that I realized something crucial. When I attached the cover letter to the email, I wasn't attaching a new saved copy of a cover letter like a saved document in Microsoft Word, I was actually sharing a real-time link to the one-and-only cover letter in Google Docs. 

The same cover letter that I had been changing nine times for nine different potential jobs. 

Horrified, I went into my Sent Mail folder, pulled out the very first job application email I sent out and clicked on the Google Docs link to the cover letter. What popped up was the latest updated version, written for the ninth job application. 

Somehow I don't think I'll be getting an interview for any of the previous eight jobs. 


**TL;DR: I didn't send out nine individually changed and saved copies of my cover letter to potential jobs, I sent out nine links to one singular cover letter in Google Docs that I changed to fit each job as I applied for it. As a result, the hiring managers for jobs 1 through 8 will only see the version of the cover letter I wrote for job 9.**"
"TIFU by trying to prove that my phone screen wouldn't crack


Having had smartphones for the past 4 years, I've never had a screen crack. No matter how many drops, the screen has always been fine.

So over a meal today when someone wouldn't stop going on about how often their screen smashes, I tried to shut them up by hitting my phone against the table.

Well what do you know, it smashed. It smashed really fucking bad. I even held it up and went *""see, they don't crack""* before realising. I then had to sit through another two hours of this douche boasting about all the times he's proved people wrong."
