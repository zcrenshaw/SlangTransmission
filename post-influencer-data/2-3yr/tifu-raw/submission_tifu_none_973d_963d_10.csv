"TIFU and almost died in the most hilarious way possible


Not today as per usual. But 18 years ago.

I had moved to California a few years earlier. A few blocks away was a grocery store. In that store was a toy section. Back then. 1998? It just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. Rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. I would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. They are the size of a pill or vitamin. If I placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back I could talk while making a stupid noise. One time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker I accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. I'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. No one is around. Nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. So I'm choking. But instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. Reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. I'm grasping at my chest. Reereet, ruuuh. My vision fades and a fall down on my back. This dislodges the squeaker with one more loud REET. After a moment on the ground I get up and go home. Deciding I'll never take a squeaker again.

Edit: Only to say thank you all for the laughs you provided me too."
"TIFU by not knowing what a queef was


Like all other posts on this sub, this did not happen yesterday, but about 10 years ago when I was in my sexual prime. Now before I begin, it should be noted I'm an only child. Therefore I had no sibling to teach me about the birds and the bees, and my parents worked ALL the time. They both worked C-Level jobs at big companies so I hardly ever saw them. Everything I know about sex today is through experience and the wonderful world of the internet.

So at this time in my life, I had already had sex with a small handful of girls. Being only 18, I thought I was hot shit. My life consisted of throwing parties at my parents vacant mansion and sex. Every 18 year olds' dream right? Well at one of my parties a group of college girls showed up (I was still a senior in high school) and the hottest girl of the college group was giving me vibes that she wanted to get it on. One thing let to another and we head up stairs..

Everything started off normal, foreplay and what not, when I finally got her naked I spread her legs so I could go down on her (I like to be a gentlemen and please the girl first). As soon I get down to that region she lets out the smallest ""toot"". Confused, I looked back up at her and she is still in a moaning bliss waiting for me to start as nothing happened. ""Did she just fart on me?"" I thought to myself. She was still begging for it so I shrugged my shoulders and we got it on.

Fast forward a week and we're now kind of ""dating,"" still having sex at least twice a day like new couples do. And each time she would let out a small ""toot."" I liked her a lot and didn't want to freak her out by asking her about it, so I decided to go to my friends (bad idea). They proceed to tell me that she's known as being a ""freak"" in bed and I just need to along with it. 

Ok here's when the actual fuck up happens... so that night we start fooling around and this time she wants to go down on me first. She's giving me the typical BJ when she goes down a little further for a little ball play... that's when I cock my legs up and release the biggest fart I could muster. I swear her hair flew back as if she had her face in front of a fan. She immediately stops what she's doing and looks back at me in disgust. I smiled with pride and said ""that's all for you babe."" 

She locked herself in my bathroom and cried until she let me call one of her friends to come pick her up. 

TL;DR: Didn't know what a queef was and thought my girlfriend was farting during sex as a fetish. I returned the ""favor"" by farting in her face when she was going down on me.

EDIT: Ok before I go on my rant I want to say WOW! I was not expecting this to blow up and I especially wasn't expecting front page and so much gold. Thank you all for your reading my stupid story and participating. 

With that said, I wrote this to make you LAUGH reddit. That's it. To put a smile on your face and hopefully make your day a little bit better. The story is true in the fact that I really did let one slip on a girl when she was in my no-no area (that girl is now my wife btw), but the rest is added filler to make it funny. I'm sorry I offended so many people on the tweaked facts. "
"TIFU by not stopping a rumor of me being a school shooter.


Like most TIFU the major fuck up happened about 2 years ago, but the build up started 6 months before that.

 Let me start by giving you some back story. I went to private school from 4th grade until this happened my Junior year of high school. Before I was homeschooled. Perfect innocent sheltered child… right? Wrong… Major social reject on all levels. Did not make any actual friends until my freshman year of high school and because of being in private school I went to the same high school as the people I went to middle school with. So all the ass hats from middle school followed me and my social position had no hope of changing. Because of this I made friends with the other “rejects”. You know… the stoners, emos, rebels, budding anarchists, and so on. I adopted every one of these stereo types. Since there were only 300 people in my school, everyone knew me and my five friends. We wore hoodies every day over our uniforms to rebel against our strict dress code, even when it was 100 degrees outside. We were those kids that parents tell their kids to stay away from. And it only made it worse that my older brother was the star quarterback and was the most popular senior in school.


Now onto the real story.


After my brother graduated I (sophomore) was expected to fill his role on the football team (I can’t play worth shit). Luckily one of my people was already on the team so I decided to join (small enough school where there weren’t tryouts). Surprisingly I actually showed up to practice and gave my hardest, but I sucked so much that it probably looked like I half assed everything. Played about 4 minutes of game time that season… on JV… whatever it was something to do. During summer off season my junior year one of the senior stars told my friend that he looked like one of the Columbine shooters… Being those kids we thought it was funny shit. So we let the rumor/joke continue. 


We never thought it would stick around because new rumors were started about us every day. But this rumor was very different. It stuck around… and grew… by the end of the season the rumor had grown extremely complex and overly detailed… but so far it had stayed in the locker room. (I didn’t care). 


I came to school the Monday before Thanksgiving break to find that my friend was not there… interesting… it was rare that we could get away with skipping school. Oh well. By the second period I had an uneasy feeling. About halfway through 2nd the dean of discipline (also head football coach) called me out of class and started walking with me to his office, he didn’t say a word. Odd but ok. 


He took me past his office and into the principle’s office (even though I was a little shit I had never been here). In here both of my parents (who should have been at work) were sitting with extremely worried expressions. The dean left and so it was just me in the room with my parents. As soon as the door shut my mom asked me what the hell was going on. I ran through my mind all the possible things that I could have been busted for that both of my parents were summoned. I said I didn’t know but kept thinking about what it could be... (pot? That kid that tried to stab me the week before?) 


After about 5 minutes of awkward and terrifying silence two detectives entered the room and asked if they could record the interview. My mind was racing and I started getting really scared. They said that one of my classmates was arrested that morning because of a school shooting tip off… (oh shit… this is not good) they told me that the informant said I was going to supply him with the guns to do it. I denied and told the officers that my family didn’t have guns and that I was only 17 so I couldn’t have bought any… My parents backed me up. The detectives asked the same question over and over again… and apparently one time I worded my answer in a way they took as me admitting guilt. 


The school expelled me and my parents contacted a lawyer and were advised to take me out of state in case a warrant was placed for my arrest. (lawyer would be alerted first and we could discuss possibilities before cops came and arrested me). We took our thanksgiving break early and visited family. 


At the end of everything my friend was 16 so they did not need a warrant to arrest him. He spent two weeks in juvenile detention center and another 6 months under house arrest before the case was wiped off his record. He had to redo his junior year and is still pretty shaken up by it. I was 17 so they needed a warrant for my arrest but they didn’t have enough evidence to get a judge to sign one. I got expelled from school and had to transfer to the public school. My parents were not mad at me at all but furious with the school. Both my friend and I are still close friends and we were both drastically changed for the better.


TL;DR. Rumor about my friend shooting up our high school and me supplying him with weapons. Cops got involved, and he was arrested and served 6 months house arrest. 


EDIT: This guy sent me a message with a link to an animated video of this story I thought it was great so I am adding it to this! [Video Story!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCteT-RqXz8)

"TIFU when trying to play a game with a friend ended up getting the FBI involved.


This happened when i was 7 years old.  


I lived in suburban midwest US, where all the kids in the neighborhood could walk alone to the park and each other's houses well across town.  My best friend lived on the other side of the park and for some reason I had this idea that it would be fun to write her an anonymous letter giving hints about which friend I was, and then inviting her to meet me at the park later to see if she had guessed correctly
.

I decided that the letter had to be typed so the handwriting wouldn't give me away.  This was 1997 and computers were so new that microsoft word was entertaining.  I had played pretend secratary enough that I had taught myself to print addresses on an envelope.  I typed up this long letter and gave her 3 clues describing who I was and set a future date for her to meet me.
    
A week or so goes by and I've pretty much forgotten about the letter when we get a frantic phone call from my friend's mom asking if I had received any suspicious mail.  She was so upset when she saw the letter that she went immediately to the police.  Due to the typed envelope and the advanced grammar (thanks Mom) the police believed there was no way this letter was from a 7 year old but surely a local child molester.  Then undercover agents were sent to stake out the park and wait for his arrival.
Her mom was calling all the parents in town warning them to check the mail and be on the lookout for local predators.

I got grounded *for lying about my involvement  at first* for quite awhile and was scared straight after I had to tell my story to the policeman.  Whoops.

*Edit:  Yes, everyone, I know computers existed well before 1997 "
"TIFU by making a joke


Earlier today, mothers birthday was going on. As we're all sitting around (roughly 15 people) my mom starts telling a story about me and sibling when we were younger.  

As the stories go on, she gets to one of me as a baby; 
""He hated wear clothes, I couldn't ever get him to keep anything on"" (etc)


So, being the joker I am, I jump out of my chair, start to take my shirt off and run across the room, all while shouting, "" Still can't!""


About halfway across the room, with my shirt half over my head, I trip blindly onto the staircase leading up, blacking out for a good 30 seconds, laying there with my shirt half off and in pain.


&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I made a joke about being naked as a baby, knocked myself out and had to lay in my shame.


Edit: Oh hi Front page (insert joke here), RIP inbox. 

Edit2: I'm 23, fire away

  
Edit3: Head is fine, guess I can take a beating, prescribed some acetaminophen. "
"TIFU by making an 11 yr old snort putrid milk



Out with my girlfriend and her son tonight for dinner and a few errands. Each time we get in the car, the two of them mention a rotten smell. I'm not picking it up as I've been fighting a cold. First trip: ""What's that smell? Bacon?"" She says. ""I don't know"" I say and joke that I 'may' have farted. Hop out and grab some Indian dinner.

Next trip ""Seriously, what is that?"" she asks. ""ugh, I know! Blech!!"" He moans. I say, ""What? really? I'm not getting anything. That's weird."" I'm thinking maybe I left some fast food in the back seat or something. We go into Sam's club and get a few things.

Trip three: ""OMG!"" They both say. Now I'm racking my brain. ""Maybe I spilled some milk or something..?"", I say. ""Spilled milk? In your car?!"" ""Yeah!"" I chuckle. ""Sometimes I drink milk in my car, you know?

Then I remember it. The 3 week old tetra pack of Horizon 2% milk that her kiddo stuck in the passenger seat pocket. He's a great kid. He's just always leaving stuff in my back seat.

""Hey Nathan, maybe that smell is the pack of milk you left in my car!"", I joke...sort of ( knowing if I'm right, maybe this'll make him stop leaving trash in the car) Here's where my brain stops working.... ""Give it a squeeze and check.""

As I give a quick glance over my shoulder to see if he's done it and if his milk is the culprit, he gives it a good squeeze. Now mind you, I thought the pack was empty. It was not. Not even close. In an instant, a burst of foul milk LITERALLY shoots UP his left nostril. Now I bust out laughing, but quickly reel it in knowing how fucked up that must be for him. He's gagging and fighting back tears. His mom's hunting for napkins or ANYTHING AT ALL to help this poor kid out. Now we're all busting a gut. He's waffling between crying, gagging and laughing and has milk still draining from his nose and running down his face. And for the first time, I get a whiff of it. I dry heave. Dry heave again. The drive home becomes a mix of laughing, gagging rolling windows up and down and planning his immediate trip to the shower so he can start to breathe through his nose again. Good times.

TL;DR. My car stunk. I convinced my girlfriend's kid to shoot rotten milk up his nose to find the culprit. It was the milk.

EDIT apologies for the difficult read. I had to post it twice and when I copy-pasted the formatting went to hell.  Didn't notice until I woke up this morning. 
Glad so many enjoyed it!"
"TIFU by knocking on my dorm window.


Unlike most TIFU this actually happened about 2 minutes ago..
I had just gotten home from my morning class, put on my jams and looked out my window. 6 stories below me I spotted a friend walking past my dorm. For the hell of it I thought i should try to get his attention. Since the windows don't open in my dorm the only way to achieve this would be knocking on the window. After about 5 knocks the window gave out sending shattered glass everywhere... it rained down on the people below. Needless to say I am FUCKED. and the worst part is I don't even know if I got my friend's attention.... 
About to submit a ""work order"" need excuses to make it look like an accident....

TL;DR. Knocked on window to get friend's attention which broke under the pressure.

Edit. I went to my RA like most of you suggested. Told him I knocked on the a few times to see if anyone could hear me... *judgmental look from him* and that it broke. He didn't laugh.. told me I was an idiot but he did not want this to be in anyway brought back to him. So he used his RA powers to call maintenance to quickly replace the window before it became a big issue. Maintenance is on their way..."
"TIFU by peeing on my girlfriend's makeup.


I'm going to start this off with a disclaimer. I wasn't aware this event even happened until my girlfriend told me about it the next morning. 

I don't like going to clubs downtown but my girlfriend does, so me being the good boyfriend that I am, I bring myself to the point of drunkenness where everything is a good idea! We didn't have much time to pre drink so I ""had"" to rush as much alcohol into me as fast as possible. 20 minutes, half a 26 of gin and a bottle of beer later, we were in an Uber headed downtown. 

Now I'm not a big guy. I'm 21 years old, just under 5'9"" and weigh about 165lbs, so you can imagine that I was feeling pretty heckin' inebriated. But the club had a promotion where an 8 ounce cup of beer cost a dollar. So how could I refuse 25 of them? Yes, I eventually vomited, but that's no issue in comparison to what would happen later that night.

Cut to bed time at around 2:30am, I had all my puke outta me, some McDonalds intta me, my face brushed and my teeth washed. I was doin' pretty well for myself in that moment.

4am rolled around and I rolled out of bed. My girlfriend awoke but soon closed her eyes after realizing I was just going to the bathroom. But my drunken ass couldn't find its way there. My girlfriend then jolted awake to the sound of my yellow rain pouring down upon her makeup bench located at the foot of her bed. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" she asked.

To which I replied, ""Pee pee"", after my stream had halted midway.

She directed me to the bathroom across the hall. I lifted the seat, emptied the remaining 7/8ths of my ammo, washed my hands and plummeted back into our bed. I had no idea that any of this happened until I checked my phone the next day.

Luckily, my gold only showered over her highlighter (it's a makeup thing, I guess) which will only cost me $50 to replace in lieu of the potential hundreds of dollars of other stuff. Fortunately for me, she wasn't mad. She actually thought it was pretty funny. She's a keeper. As for me, I'll be abstaining from alcohol for a while.

TL;DR - Got really drunk. Woke up at 4am. Didn't make it to the bathroom. Peed on my girlfriends makeup bench ruining her $50 highlighter.

Edit: 
Here's a link to the text conversation I woke up to. I figured it would give you better insight on the event. I censored our names to preserve our anonymity but some of the photos' quality worsened because of it.

"TIFU by flipping my four wheeler down the mountain and developing a bond unlike any other


This happened a little while ago but I wanted to share it with everyone.
I was getting pretty confident on my four wheeler after riding it up and down my hills in the back yard which is around  8 acres. The right side of my property is not as steep as the left side so I always climbed the right side. One day I was feeling cocky and wanted to climb up the left side because I thought it was completely possible. (Right side is about a 35 degree incline compared to the  50 degree incline on the left side) so I start up the left side, I'm doing great. Make it about 50 yards up the mountain when I hit a fox hole and it dips. I stopped accelerating and tried to slide back down which was the biggest mistake I could have made. As I was coming down I hit something else which turned the four wheeler and it flips. I hold on as it rolls me once because I didn't want to wreck my baby but as it went to roll again there was no way I was saving it so I jumped off face skid down the mountain, rolled, broke a sapling with my back and some how flipped onto my feet and ran about 15 yards before falling down again. The whole time I hear the four wheeler flipping down the mountain directly behind me. I hit the bottom of the mountain still hearing the four wheeler coming down. It smashes 3 feet behind me and is still rolling as I fish flop out of the way and it travels past me. In an adrenaline rush I feel fine. I get up. Walk over to the four wheeler on its side and flip the four wheeler onto its wheels only to see it's completely wrecked. Instantly I feel everything and fall down. This is where the stories changes. My donkey Henry runs over to me. Sniffs me. I get up because I'm worried he's gonna step on me but as I am trying to walk back to the house I keep falling down from the pain in my legs. I stand up again and Henry sticks his head under my arm and I hold onto him as he begins to walk back toward the house, making his donkey call the entire time. He walked me all the way back to the house where my parents had walked out to see what he was calling about. I suffered no broken bones though I had a terrible whiplash, two welts on my back and a connection with an animal that I've never had before. Thanks to everyone that took the time to read this extensive, grammatically incorrect story.

TL;DR Flipped my four wheeler down the mountain and my donkey Henry came to the rescue and I developed a bond unlike any I've had with an animal. 

Edit: Added photo of donkey for all to see with a goat on th four wheeler after it was fixed [Henry](http://m.imgur.com/a/pJwKD) "

"TIFU by pooping too hard and splitting my head open.


This happened a couple of days ago,  I'm still recovering.

On Thursday I got a vasectomy, everything went well, I wasn't in too much pain and they let me go home after the anaesthetic wore off. On Friday morning I was a bit sore, but I still got out of bed and went through my morning routine like normal. After breakfast I sat down on the toilet, and that's where the trouble started.

As I started pooping I could feel a dull ache growing in my balls, and the more I pushed the more intense it got, and seemed to pulsate up through my guts and down my legs. I slowly began dumping my load, and the pain got worse, like my balls were being squeezed in a rotating vice. I started to feel a bit faint, but I still wasn't finished, so I took a deep breath and prepared for the final push...

The next thing I know I'm waking from some kind of dream, wondering why everything has gone quiet, with no idea where I am or what's going on. It takes me a few moments to realise I'm face down in a puddle of blood on the bathroom floor.

I looked like an absolute mess but felt ok after that, there was a gaping wound on my forehead but at least the pain in my balls had subsided. My wife drove me to the hospital to make sure I was ok, and they glued up the gash in my head and made me hang around for four hours just in case I passed out again. Strangely, neither the ER doctor nor the surgeon who had snipped me the day before believed that pooping could trigger that kind of pain in my balls. 

The next time I took a dump I spread pillows out on the bathroom floor to catch me if I went down. I still got some intense pain, but luckily managed to stay conscious.

TL;DR: Got snipped, pooped, passed out.

Edit 1: Judging by the comments, I probably overemphasised the ""pushing"" part. I wasn't straining at all, but even the smallest muscle movement down there was setting off the pain. Still should have stopped...

Edit 2: They gave me general anaesthesia for the vasectomy, from what I understand this was the anaesthetist's personal preference. Got it done in an Australian public hospital."

"TIFU by swallowing gasoline while trying to pump it out of my scooter.


This incident didnt happen Today but i remembered it and wanted to share it with you. 
I was 15 years old and got a scooter from my father. Happily and without any knowledge i went to the Gas station to fill the tank and drive around. After filling the tank and driving a kilometer down the road the scooter made some bad noises and the exhaust was darker than usual. The engine failed and i was like: oh,f**k. i fueled the scooter with diesel.
So i pushed the scooter 2 kilometers back to home and wanted to get it out of the tank and used a garden hose to suck it out.
After doing it for some time with caution and wondering why nothing came out i sucked faster and ""surprisingly"" it came all out in a fountain and in my mouth. it was so fast and i was still trying to suck the air out that i swallowed it. Half inside my stomach and the other half inside my lungs.
Until today i am still wondering why people like the smell  of gasoline and co. it tasted horrible like it smells.
I was coughing and trying not to die running back home and trying to explain myself to my family. I tried to puke and a little came out. My father and i went to the hospital. They made x-ray photos of my lungs. The lady there made me think i might die because of toxicating my lungs with diesel.
They gave me an infusion and also fucked this a little bit up by putting the needle in the wrong place and pulling it out with a fountain of my blood and a bruise. i stayed there for 1 night and the next day i could go home. Scince this day I still try not to vomit while going to the gas station.
sry for bad englüsh :)

TL;DR: I swallowed diesel while trying to get it out of my scooter and nearly died because of a lung toxication."
