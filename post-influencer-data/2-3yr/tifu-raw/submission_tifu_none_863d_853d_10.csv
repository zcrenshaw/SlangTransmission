"TIFU and punched a total stranger in the face


This literally happened about 15 minutes ago. I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.

TL;DR Tried to save a baby's balloon from flying away but ended up punching a stranger in the face."
"TIFU By trying to shake Obama's hand and almost getting taken out by Secret Service and ruining thousands of peoples day.


As with most TIFU, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post I saw on the front page. During the 2008 election, Obama came to my University to give a speech. I went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. I was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

When Obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a QandA session. When he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. I was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. Everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. He had a pen in his hand and was signing away. I thought to myself ""Damn, I don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm OH WAIT! Yes I do. My ticket I used to get into the event."" There was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my INSIDE jacket pocket**. So as the future president is 4 people away, I hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. Just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

They immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. It all happened so fast I couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all I had was a piece of paper for Obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. I was just able to get my bearings about me and I was the last person to shake Obama's hand at that event.  About that time the security all turned to Obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. As Obama was being ushered out he said ""Sorry guys, they said I have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. So not only did I almost get taken out by secret service, I ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.




TL;DR: Tried to shake Obama's hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made Obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day.

"TIFU by climbing 999 steps with empty pockets.


Quick disclaimer: This was a year ago.

I'm a huge history nerd and I absolutely love exploring ancient sites. My mother and I took a trip to Greece and were on a tourbus.

One of our many stops were Nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said ""If you climb 999 steps, you'll find the beautiful fortress of Paladimi. The entire bus chuckled (Mainly middle aged, few elders.) But being the teenage self I am, I was determined to climb those steps.

There's a slight problem however, I was really out of shape.

I am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn't weigh me down. Left me with just my phone. She decided she didn't want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.

I begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. I had a sense of pride as I stepped to the entrance of the gate. I would be able to see a part of Greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn't able to see. I would have stories to tell at the dinner table. I would have amazing pictures.

Suddenly, right at the door I see a sign.

""8 Euros for admission"" 

and with that, I took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps. 

TL;DR

I left my wallet and climbed a mountain to see a historical site, only for there to be an admission fee.

"TIFU by cleaning my humidifier and almost killing my entire family


Obligatory - This actually did happen today.

My family and I live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central Arizona, USA.  The whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  For those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  Since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  Basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  It's one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.

For various reasons not apropos to this TIFU, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  Today I decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  Possibly inspired by another recent TIFU, I also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  While cleaning, though, I noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""No big deal,"" thought I.  Eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  I scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.

Here's where the TIFU really starts.  Some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  I decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places I couldn't reach.  ""But,"" thought I, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  I figured I should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, I figured, is better at that than bleach?

Right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""Uh, dude..."" Yeah, I know.  Or, I should have known.  But I didn't think it through, so I poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  Almost immediately thereafter, I took a whiff and started coughing.  At that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  Turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and I'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system.

I immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  Of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  So now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days I'll be coughing like I've got the black lung, Pa.

TL;DR - Tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.

EDIT - Words

EDIT 2 - Front page, neat.  It has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine - I think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  Finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that I'm an engineer, I have to - if everyone doesn't know, I'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  Can't have that.

EDIT 3 - Lot's of fake internet points AND my first gold!?  It's almost worth the war crime!  Thanks!"

"TIFU by trying to scare my wife. NSFW


This actually happened today.  I'm writing this while currently in the doghouse.  So my wife and I are just finishing a nice shared bath.  We are almost ready to get out when she notices that her crazy bipolar dog is sitting by the tub shaking instead of her usual spot under the bed in fear of her getting her own bath.  My wife being slightly paranoid instantly thinks something or someone must be in the bedroom that is making the dog scared.  She ignores my logic that the dog is bipolar and if there were anyone or anything in the bedroom she would be going nuts barking.  Not to mention my husky is in the living room and would not let anyone in without doing something.  

Well.  We get out of the tub and start to dry off all the while my wife is eyeing the bathroom door into the bedroom which is wide open.  She finishes drying off and as women do she wraps the towel around her.  Now she needs to check out the bedroom.  She literally gets down near the door and starts crawling towards the door.

Here is where my fuck up happens.  She is crawling in nothing but a towel about to peak around the doorframe to the rest of the bedroom.  Of course what do I do standing there seeing her butt facing me holding a towel?  Yep.  I think a quick little pop to the butt will scare her good.  Without a second thought I let a light little flick of the towel fly.  Oh but I forget.  It's not how hard you flick the towel it's how you flick the towel.  It was almost perfect...except my aim was off.   Yes in my stupidity did i not only manage to pull off a perfect snap of the towel but i managed to perfectly center my aim right where no one ever wants to be hit.  It was literally looked like it was in slowmotion as I watched in horror the towel popping right in my wifes crack.  I knew the look well she gave when she turned and rolled to her back.  I get her up and breathing normal again and then I see the other look.  I know I deserve this look.  

She has recovered now and is sleeping soundly.  There was no after bath fun.  There will likely be no fun of any kind for as long as she is mad.  I have no idea how much laundry or dishes I will need to do.  Nor do I know how many flowers or dinners it will take.

TL;DR. tried to pop my wife in the butt to scare her.  Accidently hit her in her privates instead.  Her dog started everything rolling but now I'm the one in the doghouse."
"TIFU by taking a dump that destroyed part of my house


Well, actually, Tuesday I fucked up by taking a shit that destroyed part of my house, but rule #4 prevented this post from happening for a couple days. In the end, that's probably a good thing for the post, because the shit was just the tip of the iceberg. I've been fucking up every day since when trying to deal with this.

Tuesday morning, about 3 AM, I wake up and go to the bathroom. I sit down and know I'm in for some trouble because this dump is large and about to punish my butthole. Some pain and minutes later, I finish up and flush the toilet. Clogged. I shut the rising water off, grab the plunger and get to work. That clog ain't budging. Screw this, it's 3am, I'll deal with it after I actually wake up. I go to work on it again in the morning. Still ain't budging. Screw it. I shower and go to work, I'll deal with it when I get home.

I get home, head into the bathroom. The bowl of the toilet reeks. It's lined with dry shit water. I turn the water back on to let it fill back up and rinse the bowl, then I go sit down and watch some TV. About 15 minutes later, I hear a loud crash. There always used to be loud crashes in this house with no explanation, we'd chuckle and say it must be the ghost. Without missing a beat, I chuckled and thought, ""must be the ghost."" About 1/2 an hour later, I had to piss, and remembered I needed to unclog a toilet too. I walk around the corner, open the door, and holy shit.

The toilet is running. The flapper never came down and it just kept filling and filling until the floor is covered in shit water. I start to panic and dash in, throw towels on the ground, it's not enough. I run into my bedroom and start grabbing old shirts to throw down. Still not enough. I run back and grab an old sheet and comforter off the bed. That manages what's on the floor. As I stand there wrapping my head around this, I remember the crash 1/2 an hour earlier. My eyes dart to A/C vent on the floor... motherfucker, who puts a vent on the floor? I do the math and take off down the steps into the basement.

HVAC ducts all over the floor. Shitty pouring down through where those pipes used to be, all over the wash and dryer, all over cardboard boxes, clothes, files, records. And then I grab a nearby stool and sit down and watch as the water slows to a steady drip. ""Oh. Shit. This is bad."" 

Mopped the basement up, and started to let it dry. Came back up stairs and went into the bathroom. Threw the shit water soaked rug into the tub. Continued cleaning up what water was left over with my soon to be trashed shirts and bed clothes. Go into my bedroom to sit down and take just take everything in again. ""Hm, this carpet is a little wet. Must have tracked some water in with me earlier."" Fuck up number two. And in the end, the grandest fuck up.

Later that night, I notice the carpet isn't really drying. The wet foot prints I left, they were starting to become pretty soggy. I grab a towel, drop it on top of it, and start trying to soak it up. Fuck up number three because there was no method to my madness. I should have been working from the outside in. Instead, I was just spreading all that water out. By the end of the night, two or three soggy foot prints becomes a giant puddle of shit water in my carpet that will not relent. I stay up until around 2 AM, going at it from the outside in this time, but the damage has already been done. I put a fan on it and go to bed.

Wake up Wednesday morning. It's pretty bad. On the way home from work, I swing by a hardware store to rent a wet vac. The internet seemed pretty high on these thing's ability to suck water out of a carpet. Six hours later, I've maybe sucked 1/2 gallon a of water out. In the end, I think it only made things worse as several spots seemed much wetter than before. That's what, TIFU #4?

Things didn't seem too bad on Thursday. With the exception of a couple spots, the carpet was just damp. I kept a fan on it when it wasn't covered. Washed and dried some towels, dropped them to soak and went out for a couple hours. I get home, and the smell of shit is permeating through the house. I didn't think to close off the few A/C vents that still work. 

Friday morning. The carpet smell begins to hit. It wasn't too strong though. I take to the internet again. If your carpet's a bit damp, what does the internet tell you to do? Baking soda! So I threw that baking soda down and left for work. Turns out baking soda will fuck up your vacuum cleaner. I guess that's not too serious because it's not like it'll do it right off that bat, but I just feel like this week keeps on kicking. At this point, I'm out of ideas. I'm pretty sure it's gone through to the subfloor. Tearing the carpet and padding up wasn't really an option to begin with, and now I'm taking a break from cleaning out my room and preparing to tear everything up. I am defeated. 

TL;DR: Took a shit that flooded my bathroom. It destroyed the insulation, A/C, a ton of possessions, and now the additional nightmare of my carpet. 

Edit: So this took off since I last got to check it. Thanks for the gold, whoever did that!

Yes, there is home owner's insurance. Things are going to get taken care of. I got bent on trying to take care of the carpet without removing everything from my bedroom. I get now that it's something I can't tackle by myself. Those of you who told me to get a dehumidifier right away to help dry things out and slow down or prevent things from happening, I did that. I don't really know what else I can offer in the way of an update right now?

Some people seemed bothered that this started on Tuesday and not today? Sorry? I checked the rules and they said that was okay.

Anyway, glad some people got a kick out of it. Thanks for the comments and advice."
"TIFU by setting my anus ablaze with the fury of a thousand suns.


Obligatory this didn't happen today, it was actually a few weeks back. 

So I am a 17 year old boy, and like most 17 year old dudes I have moderate acne that I constantly have to deal with. Nothing crazy, but just enough to make me buy cheap anti-acne facial exfoliating pads. The things work, but due to whatever is in them they sting a little when applied and leave a very slight lingering burning sensation. I keep these on my special hygeine shelf in my room, right next to my toothbrush, toothpaste, hair gel, and deodorant.

Oh, and also my hemorrhoid pads.

Recently​ I gave myself a hemorrhoid by shitting too hard or however it is you get hemorrhoids, and it has been the worst experience of my life. You know how when you get bit by a mosquito you have an intense itch, and the more you scratch the worse it gets? Imagine that.

X 1000.
On your asshole.

So the only relief I have been able to find has been these pads that you apply to said area, as a reactive treatment to the itching. There is also a cream, that you are supposed to lather on a mini dildo-thing and insert into your butt. 

So, here's the FU. While doing desk work in my room, I casually reached to scratch said itch, not thinking twice. Well, as I said, it slowly got worse and worse until I was furiously tearing at my jeans. I have never itched that bad in my life. Suddenly remembering the pads, I sprung out of the chair and frantically unscrewed the lid and grabbed a handful of pads. I also took the little dildo thing, wanting full release from this hell that was my turd tunnel, and used the pad to continue scratching not only the outside, but INSIDE of my ass.

Normally there is a slight burning feeling, then the soothing effect takes hold and I continue on with my day.

This was not to be.

You see in my frantic scramble for relief, I had accidentally grabbed the  acne facial exfoliating pads. My anus felt like someone had poured molten copper in/around it. It is the most painful sensation I have ever experienced. I immediately fell to the ground, screaming in pain and doing my best to find relief to no avail.

Well, all of my screaming alerted my mother, and she burst into my room to find me lying naked on the ground with a mini black dildo in my asshole, screaming in pain.

TL;DR- I mixed up my exfoliating alcohol acne pads and my hemorrhoid pads, and used an acne pad on the interior of my asshole, which resulted in the most painful experience I have endured in my life.

"TIFU by mistaking bacon fat for Oreo cream


I work as a dishwasher at a small diner-type place. It's not the greatest job, but I stick around because everyone's friendly and I get free food. 

The cooks there like to be creative with the specials. On this particular day the special was Oreo pancakes, which were just pancakes with crushed up Oreos cooked in. Then, they spread on what looked to be Oreo cream over the top. I'm still not sure if it was the real deal or some homemade concoction, but either way, I wanted some. 

While I was washing dishes in the back kitchen, one of the chefs dropped off a bucket of kitchenware that needed to be washed. One of the items was an emptied container, caked to the sides was a thick white substance. With food on the mind, I immediately thought, ""Oh sweet! It's that Oreo cream!""

Without hesitation I took a big finger full and put it in my mouth. This was immediately followed by a full face cringe. As it mulled around in my mouth, I realized it was pure, uncooked, bacon fat. I spat out what I could and spent a good five minutes trying to wash the taste out of my mouth. Hours later I can still taste the bacon fat, and I still have not acquired that Oreo cream.

TL;DR: I had Oreo cream on the mind, and the second I saw a container filled with a white substance, I took a big finger full and ate it. It was bacon fat, and it was disgusting.

"TIFU by doing the worm at a school dance. NSFW


I'm not the most smooth man in the world. As with most FUs, this wasn't actually today. Rather, this was a few months ago. I debated on writing this the day of, but my shame overtook me and I decided I would wait until a better time.

That better time is now, apparently.

Does anyone remember March 25, 2017? Perhaps it isn't significant to any of you, but that was the day that I went to my Sadies Dance at school. I'm getting chills recounting this.

To fully understand the context of my FU, one must realize that I have never gone to a Sadies Dance. For anyone that doesn't know, Sadies Dances are events where a girl asks a guy to the dance; this is a twist on traditional gender roles in the United States. I actually went to this dance because a girl invited me to go with her and some friends. That was cool.

The other cool thing about this dance was that I went with this group in some Napoleon Dynamite-inspired clothes, where we had previously made matching shirts together in the style of ""Vote for Pedro.""

So imagine a lanky, 17 year old boy going to a dance with a group. The dance is casual, and everyone is having a good time. There are even dance circles forming, and people are showing off their break-dancing skills. Our group decides to make a mock circle, dicking around and pretending to do cool moves. 

This is where I get my idea, and completely FU. 

The beat is about to drop for this song, and there's a big buildup. The circle is actually considering imploding on itself, because nobody has gone to the center in nearly half a minute. I decide that I'm going to do the worm, and fall to the ground exactly as the beat drops.

I go out to the center of the circle. The beat is about to drop. I jump, and land exactly horizontally onto the ground as the drop happens. ~~Everything is going according to plan.~~

Until I land on my penis and pain just explodes throughout my body, radiating from my genitals. I could actually feel the pain pulse through me, and I got goosebumps from the intensity.

I'm no physics student, so I'm not entirely sure this happened. I was wearing jeans at the time, and my penis was positioned down as it normally was. My guess is that the jump I did to match the bass drop moved my penis up and into a U shape, and then the momentum carried that shape until I fell.

But it gets worse.

I'm on the ground. I need to do the worm. There's no way that I can simply just fall on the ground and not do anything. People are looking at me. They'd make fun of me if I just fell down. I can't let this happen. 

So I continue to do the worm, slamming my pelvis into the ground each time. I'm absolutely destroying my genitalia by doing this, but I know that I have to. After about five slams, I get up, laugh, and go to the circle with everyone else. I actually almost fall down on the way out, because I was starting to lose feeling in my legs.

I excuse myself from the group, give my friends a smile, and go to the bathroom to inspect the damage.

There's nobody in the stalls, so I'm able to rush in and evaluate the state of my dick.

There's red EVERYWHERE. Oh. My. God. I'm going to have to call my mom and tell her to pick me up, or ask my friends to take me to urgent care. holyshitthiscannotpossiblygetanyworsebecauseimightaswelljustcommitseppukuohmygod

Wait.

I inspect closer.

This isn't blood. This is just dye leaking from the red lettering of my ""Vote for Pedro"" shirt. I just have this massive bruise.

It's not terrible, but I'll probably not be dancing for the rest of this night. I go out. I see my friend, named Hailey. I smile at her. I sit down.

I don't think I've crossed my legs since then.

I'm not the most smooth man in the world.

TL;DR
I go to dance, land on my dick, think there's blood everywhere, just turns out my shirt leaked."

"TIFU by trying to be Tesla


In keeping with TIFU tradition this happened many years ago. We were a pair of young and passionate engineers. If you only care how this ended, skip down to the part where we departed engineering and entered the hallowed, and now carbon-scorch marked, ground of the TIFU. TIL: Tesla himself submitted a TIFU after melting the first AC generator in the country at Niagara Falls. He forgot the off switch.


The Plan


[HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program) is a government project and we wanted to see if we could do something similar with spare parts and a pickup truck -- instead of a bloated military expenditure run by professionals. We were going to try for a bit of mad science instead of the nice and polished kind a billion dollars buys. Point of note: There are no mad scientists, just mad engineers. They don't have control groups and tend to care more about making awesome as fuck things happen than petty contrivances like FCC radiated power standards.


The goal was to use some Tesla-inspired engineering and a junkyard of old electronics parts to make our own HAARP. Tesla's experiments are simple and every electronics enthusiast knows them by heart. They need: capacitors, coils, and a really big off switch.


The Capacitors


Capacitors usually come in micro or pico-farad sizes. We needed a *really* big cap -- so about, uhh, a few million times bigger. America! Go big, or go home. We built some big honkers out of metal drums and coated the inside with paint. We checked continuity and had to redo it a few times before we actually got that right. In went the guts that make a capacitor, and we're done with that.


We had to come back to this once the coils were done. At the end of the series we filled up some two liters with our secret capacitor sauce and would run some AC pulses through it into a multiwatt resistor block out of some industrial equipment. Math ensued, and we hit our tolerances. 


The Coils


We had to wind the coils ourselves too. We needed what was basically a voltage ladder, which would be a series of transformers at like 50:1 each time. It's not a problem for the first few in the series, but when you start getting *reeeeeeally* high voltages, even the tiniest crack in your wiring and everything's on fire. We had to use really thick wires because those come with really thick insulation that won't have any cracks in it. It got... big... and... heavy. And this is how we went from pickup truck to flatbed. Go big or go home!


The Off Switch


The most important part of any mad science... is making sure you can shut it off. Many an evil overlord have died shortly after screaming ""But -- *I am invincible*!"" *Off*. *Switch*. Ours was made of some pneumatics pulled from a dead caterpillar. It pushes forward, the connectors meet, and we have juice. When we're done, we hand-pump it the other way to release it. It's also safe because we're not near it and it's all plastics, rubber, and non-conductive oils. Out of a fear of having the pump fail from our nearby barely controlled chaos, we opted for the hand pump. Slow -- but it can't break. 


The Juice


We were going to power this off the mains. No, not house mains. Overhead mains. The big ones. Don't ask how we hooked it up. Think junkyard. Bored engineers. Imagine! Tesla's experiments needed a lot of juice. So does HAARP. And there was no legitimate way to get that much power except right from the source just like he did. 



How it *Should* have worked


We'd get some spectacular arcing in our mystery sauce substitute for the primary tap output. It would make the air ionize. That's what HAARP tries to do, except a mile in the air. Normally, Tesla coils are put in open air to let the arcing have a little fun and put on a light show. We needed that in a confined space so it was less the light show and more what the light show did that we needed: Ionization. We put it inside a tall pipe and sprayed the inside with non-conductive paint many times. We should also get some pretty good heating effect, so air would draw in from the bottom, pushing the ionized air out through the top. I think it put out something like 800 million volts by the math. For comparison, most people are sane enough to stop at around 500k to 3 million. If it were left in the open air... the arcing distance would be over 20 meters long. 


There was no video of this because, obviously, hooking into the HV mains is frowned upon. Most people do it for less savory reasons than the wholesome pursuit of science. Also, we didn't think anything more sophisticated than a vaccum tube would survive anywhere near our monstrosity. The intense RF radiation causes lightbulbs to glow -- even just from the transmission tower, which is just due to the current flow and not a deliberate engineering choice. Cell phones near it would probably never work again. But that was going to be all we'd have to worry about. The circuit was balanced. We had a off switch that could not fail. It wouldn't draw any more juice than the factory that had run here before. Nobody would notice.


Transportation


We thought it might be best to not be around when five hundred people called in asking why the lights flickered and then everything wireless went ape shit. A normal car has normal electronics, which might not work after if this was loaded in back on the flat bed. Remember what I said about big drums and big coils? That's... big heavy. So -- diesel engine. God bless something that can survive a nuke. We also needed to sure our vehicle was primitive enough to survive any mishaps and carry away the evidence with us. 


This was less a finely tuned chunk of RF engineering and more like a hundred ton coal-powered locomotive. But it'd put on a pretty light show. We would throw a couple thick plastic tarps and sheets all over the back of the truck, which should protect it. Electricity takes the shortest path to ground -- with all the metal covered and the vehicle propped up on rubber tires, it wouldn't be a problem. Airplanes get hit by lightning all the time and nothing happens. Our ride was sure to live.


The Location


We carefully selected a location where we could set up, and be near a transmission tower and a road. That took time, but we eventually found a parking lot behind a closed factory. A few cars were around, parked, but it was quiet and that was perfect. 


**Here's when TIFU enters the game**


We waited until it was late enough nobody was going to see a couple dumb kids pull up in a wheezing diesel with a tarp over something big in the back. A few minutes of setup and we do our (redacted) on the tower, and we're ready to throw the dead man switch. The hydraulic pistons edge slowly forward as we frobbed the foot lever. After a minute or so, a loud and deep buzz filled the air. 


The st. elmo's fire was spectacular. Just as we expected, the heating effect caused the air to ionize and in seconds we had a nice glow coming out of it. And by glow, I mean roar. Like back of a fighter jet roar. It actually reminded me of some experiments you see in high power physics or nuclear reactors. It was a sight to behold ripping out of the back of a flatbed. It started to heat up. A few sparks flew out of the coils, but given the juice pouring through it that was hardly a surprise. We weren't going to run it long.


Well everything went to hell pretty much as soon as we confirmed our little frankenstein did something cool. The two liters? We did the circuit perfectly. We overengineered everything else. Except those fucking bottles. We were tired and it'd been a month of fuckery building it. We fudged. Just run it a few minutes, see what happens, and then pack it in, right? The bottles didn't last that long. And when they went a minute in, it was to a loud boom and spray. 


Inside the circuit, there's a resonant frequency allows the best discharge of energy. Deviate much from that, and your whole circuit can become unstable. Rather than a smooth cycling flow, you'll start to get harmonics and stuff. Ordinarily, this just means you don't get a pretty lightshow anymore and your little Jr. Tesla Coil Science Kit just makes an underwhelming buzzing noise and lets out the magic smoke. The feedback eventually just karks it. We... did not have a Tesla Coil Science Kit Jr. -- ""For Safe, Clean Fun!"". No. We had the Tesla Coil Science Kit Sr., and it's motto was ""Let's Fuck Some Shit Up."" 


With that much energy floating around, that meant wild excursions in voltage and current. Gratz... we're now ground zero of exactly what happened to Tesla right before he melted the Niagara falls generators. The only difference is... this thing has an RF element. The smooth flow of ionized air started chiefing bad. It started shitting out lightning balls like an angry steam locomotive. Near a transmission tower. Which it was connected to. We... are not clever engineers anymore. We'd put it at least five times the distance of our expected arc distance between our apparatus and the tower -- so there was no way for it to ground out on it. That would have been very bad. 


Ionized air is... ionized. Ionized means it eats the paint off of shit. Literally. While we were trying to figure out if our new Chiefer Coil Deluxe(tm) was either an experimental success or a horrifying failure before shutting it off, Chiefer Coil decided to end the debate with huge fucking sparks in the everywheres. The drum wasn't insulated anymore. And our circuit wasn't stable anymore. This... was now causing lightning on a cloudless night that would have been visible for miles, along with orange and bluish shit floating around up there. It would have looked like an angry UFO saucer on a war path to the people on the freeway miles away.


We didn't know if there was enough left of the equipment to dampen any oscillations enough to keep the current from jumping to one of those ionized pockets that it was shitting out. Main line current will crispy critter you *instantly* With transformer isolation compromised the secondaries (output) could feed back into the primary (input). We were faced now with a daunting choice: Rush the hydraulics to release the connection, run and leave a very pissed off power company and half a million people behind, or begin praying at about 7 megaprayers per second. We made about 21 megaprayers while throwing paper-rock-scissors to see who'd rush the hydraulic disconnect.


It was a harrowing run to the primer to retract the hydraulics. I stomped on that like a Erdogan body guard on that thing, pulling the oil into the reservoir and kark it before it karked me. All around, lightning was grounding out to everything metal and the air was humming after our equipment dropped the bass. Well, again, our circuit execution was flawless. Our materials design was... less so. We retracted the hydraulics but a spark gap had formed. The mains didn't want to let go. Now we had an ape-shit tesla coil feeding back on itself next to something that was now sending a continuous arc ten feet straight up. It danced about in curling ribbons while pyrotechnics of blue and gold shot all around it. If one of those hit, the ionization path would send potentially a billion volts up to the tower and backfeed into the main grid. It'd be exactly like a lightning strike, only far, far worse. The noise of all of this had everything around us vibrating with a deafening and modulating hum. We thought we just needed to retract it a little more than the arc gap would be if the HV grounded out. Which is true: We didn't know it at the time but this is how power companies turn them off. 


We were fucking terrified for about ten seconds that it might not actually turn off. It did, just like it does for the power company, and the acrid smell of ozone was the only trace we left behind as we took our asthmatic (and borrowed) diesel, only the engine working and all the lights dead, and the smoking ruins of the equipment back out into the country before taking grinders to our equipment. Engineers: 0. Mother Nature: 1.


TL;DR We built a really big tesla coil and nearly melted a power plant.


EDIT: Some note technical details are incorrect or missing. *This is not accidental*. Moderators allowed this post on that condition.


EDIT: PLEASE stop asking how to do this! It was a *fuck up* in the fine establishment of mad science, not a ringing endorsement to be suicidal. The plans were inscribed in the Electronomicon and left in an electronics graveyard. Only the high priests in the field of EE know of its location.


EDIT: There was something else here I had to remove because some loser pulled an /r/shittymorph . Please disregard... and now I finally know what people are talking about on that one. Someone write a bot to point these trolls out so we can all hate on them together. :( "
