"TIFU by trying to popping a forehead zit and almost cutting my balls off


I'm coming out of the shower doing a bit of a dance to the cranked up stereo. It's Saturday and I've got nowhere to go and the day belongs to me, everything is awesome. As I'm heading to grab some clothes I do a little peacock preening in the mirror above the dresser only to discover a stress zit above my eyebrow. This will not do on my most awesome day of days. Quickly leaning in I fail to notice one of the draws is slightly open. As I lean in my knee pushes the drawer close, only problem is my dick and balls are hanging low.

Pain, instant pain, nothing but pain, inconceivable pain.

So an hour later I'm sitting here in front of reddit without pants (again) in the unusual position of trying not to swell up, icepack wedged between my legs. Feel free to come up your own moral for this story as I contemplate spending my most awesome day of days doing some serious day drinking.

TL;DR  Day drinking pantless is not as much fun as I thought it would be after drawer tries to bite my balls off"
"TIFU when my teacher almost called Child Services because of a pair of binoculars.


Like most Tifu’s, this did not happen today, but rather when I was younger. Perhaps 5 or 6. My dad was all too happy to fill in the details where I was lacking, because he thought it was “bloody hilarious.” 

So when I was a kid, I received a pair of binoculars for my birthday - a pair of cheap, plastic red ones that were actually rather powerful. I spent quite a lot of time looking into our backyard with them, picking out local wildlife and being awed by the detail. 

But alas, as with all children, a mix of curiosity and boredom got the better of me over time. So, while in the kitchen I flipped the binoculars over and a new, friggin’ world was born. 

Everything looked further away, condensed into tiny, distant versions of themselves. I walked all around our kitchen, banishing everything in sight to the nether regions of an optic void. 

My parents, who were sitting in the kitchen at the time, watched me explore happily…up to the point where I walked straight into a wall. The rims of the binoculars slammed into my face and I fell back, hard, with giant rings around my eyes. 

It hurt quite a bit, but after a bit of crying from me and laughter from my parents, I was all right. My dad decided I resembled a raccoon. 

Fast forward to the next day. School time. I mostly forgot about the state of my eyes as the bruising was largely superficial - just two, big purple rings around the rims, making me look like a goddamn trash panda.

When I went into class, my classmates started asking me what happened and, given what did happen, I lied. All they got were bits and fragments of a fight, possibly with a bully, perhaps a sibling. My teacher eventually picked up on it, seeing the other kids clustered around me and me sitting very still, eyes on my desk, very red in the face. 

We’ll call her Ms. Smith for the sake of privacy, and she was very caring. She told the other kids to go to their seats and then knelt to ask me what happened. 

As with the others, I only etched out a series of incomprehensible fragments. Accident, hit, eyes, parents, laughing, not too bad. Literally anything to avoid saying I’d walked into a goddamn wall because I looked through binoculars backwards.

For her, this came across as a textbook child-abuse case. She rubbed my shoulder and told me everything would be all right. Then she went about teaching class, making sure to check up on me throughout the day.

Towards the end class, I’d already begun to forget about the incident, my young mind wondering onto newer things. But when class let out, Ms. Smith gently asked me to wait behind. She sat me next to her desk and informed me that she’d called my parents, wanting to set up a meeting with them. 

I wasn’t sure how to respond, but sure as hell didn’t plan on bringing up the binoculars. So I just nodded and agreed to wait. 

My parents showed up about fifteen minutes later, probably fearing their kid had done something terrible. I remember the look on their faces when Ms. Smith sat them down and asked, very seriously, if they abused their child. 

My dad picked up on her implications immediately, seeing my bruised eyes, and he burst out laughing. My mom just looked appalled, just at the thought of child and abuse being mentioned in the same sentence. 

Ms. Smith, God bless her, retained her composure as best she could, but my dad’s constant cackling made her a bit prickly. She reminded him it was very serious issue, but my dad just kept guffawing until my mom intervened, finally realizing what happened too. 

She explained I’d walked into a wall, like an idiot, looking through binoculars backwards, and that that was why I had two massive rings around my eyes. 

In the midst of all this, I felt overcome with different emotions, and resorted to a sort of half-laugh, half-sob. Ms. Smith asked me if this was true, and I nodded numbly, sniffling. She gave my parents a look conveying her sympathy for their having a kid as bright as a bag of nails. 

My dad, of course, never let me live it down, and bought it up whenever he could, but I learned my lesson. Everyone agreed to keep it quiet for a little while, on account of my embarrassment, but it resurfaced eventually and now I’m telling the wonderful Reddit community about it! 

TL;DR I walked into a wall looking through binoculars backwards, got huge bruises around my eyes, was too embarrassed to tell my teacher why they were there, and she almost called Child Services. 

*Edit: And holy fuck, this thing blew up so now a bunch of you are privy to one of my biggest childhood embarrassments. Well...dealing with shame of childhood trauma is best done in the company of understanding Redditors, as they say, so thank you all. "
"TIFU by going Christmas shopping high and unintentionally roasting my dad


So this happened last Christmas. I needed to do my Christmas shopping and I figured “Why not eat an edible right before this. It will make the lines a bit more bearable.” I thought this was a great idea so I ate the cookie, hopped on the bus and was at the mall in no time. All is well so far and it starts to hit me just about 30 minutes after I get there. I get my mom a nice bath robe, my brother a sick Star Wars Poster and now all I had to do was get my dad a gift. I was thinking and then it hit me, “He could use a Bluetooth earpiece for making calls!” This was a great idea as he was constantly on the phone talking to his clients and I figured it would be nice if he didn’t have to hold the phone up to his ear the whole time. I walked into the store (I honestly can’t remember the name of it) and my baked mind was looking any sort of Bluetooth looking earpiece. I found one, grabbed and bought it. There! My Christmas shopping was a done. I get home, mindlessly wrap the gifts and I was so excited to give everyone their presents.

Christmas morning rolls around and I give my brother the poster, he loves it. I give my mom the fluffy bath robe, she loves it then I give my dad the supposed Bluetooth earpiece, he lets out a nervous laugh and than sets it to the side. I didn’t think much of it at the time because my dad has never been one to love receiving gifts so I brushed it off. Fast forward a week or two and I’ve noticed he’s still be making calls while holding the phone up to his ear. I was a bit bummed out that he wasn’t using my gift but it’s about the thought, right? In this case, I hope he didn’t feel that it was all about the thought and here’s why. 

Fast forward 6 months later to yesterday and my dad tells me to retrieve something from his drawer next to his bed. I retrieve it and guess what else is in there? It’s the Bluetooth earpiece but then it hit me. This was NOT a Bluetooth earpiece to make calls from a phone. It was a god damn hearing aid. I got my 57 year old dad a hearing aid for Christmas. 

Don’t get high and shop, kids. 

TL;DR: Bought my 57 year old dad a hearing aid instead of a Bluetooth earpiece for making phone calls. 


Edit: To anyone doubting my story, it was a noise amplifier similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0061F6QUG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_ma6gozbM3KPDZA). It had a hook around the ear and I thought I was buying something like [this](http://www.smartphonemag.com/old_blogs/media/H500.jpg)."
"TIFU when I tried to put my recently escaped puppy back in his crate at 3 am.


This happened about 10 hours ago. We got our pup, Ranger, a couple weeks ago. He is a black lab. He has been awesome, if a lot of work. The cat isn't a big fan, and does sometimes hiss at him and tries to stay as far away as possible, but I'm sure they'll work it out eventually. Anyways, he usually needs to potty at 1 am and then again at about 5 am. So I have been pretty sleep deprived lately. 

After taking him out at 1 am, I got back in bed and fell asleep. I wake up at 3, super groggy, not sure what's going on. I guess I had left the crate door open and Ranger had somehow wriggled up on the bed to snuggle with me. As he's not totally potty trained, I had to get him back in his crate. 

I pick him up, open the crate and try to put him back in. He starts to protest, but the middle of the night is no time for whining about the crate so I just shove him in there. At that point he has fully waken up. He hisses at me and frantically starts clawing everything in sight, including my arms, then shoots out of the bedroom at mock speed. Still pretty foggy and confused myself, I click on the light. 

There's Ranger, sleeping at the back of the crate. Outside the bedroom, there's Kit Kat, indignantly wondering why I woke him up in the middle of the night from a peaceful sleep and decided right then and there was a good time to lock him in 4'x2' crate with his mortal enemy.

The light also revealed long, deep scratches up and down my arms, bleeding all over the place. 

This pic accurately describes the first couple weeks: https://imgur.com/gallery/km4Gw

TL;DR. Puppy somehow got out of crate to snuggle at night. Groggy, I woke up and shoved him back in there, only to find I was attempting to lock the cat in with the new demon we had brought home. Cat didn't appreciate that and I have some bad scratches to prove it. "

"TIFU when I almost died while paddle boarding with my dog.


Finally happy to be reporting on a Tifu that happened to me just yesterday at my cabin in North Georgia. 

My family and I enjoy spending most of our weekends in the summer up at Seed Lake. One such activity we love doing is paddle boarding which, for those who don’t know, is where you paddle around...on a surfboard big enough to not tip over. The name is self-explanatory.

So on Sunday, I went out on the paddle board with my 90-pound Yellow Labrador named Dyson. I know he’s not ideal for this sort of activity, given the issue of balance and all, but he’s extremely chill about most activities. Here's him hanging out on a tube: https://i.imgur.com/pcTwFKj.jpg So he’s definitely not a nuisance on a big, sturdy paddle board...for the most part. 

In the beginning we were actually fine, with me paddling about fifteen feet from the shore and him sitting and watching minnows/wildlife. It was peaceful, serene, and relaxing. The water’s a nice, deep green and clear enough to see a couple feet down, so we were feeling good up until the point a snake slithered out from the bank.

If you’ve ever seen a snake swim, it instantly ups their “oh fuck no” factor by a couple hundred points. And this is from someone who loves danger noodles in general. But a venomous one slithering through the water, heading straight for us is entirely another matter. 

I went stone-still, hoping it would just go past us as though we didn’t exist, and it actually seemed about to do just that. Unfortunately my goddamn, 90-pound, spineless sack of crap of a dog had other plans, as he took one look at the snake, then at me, and leapt off the paddle board in the opposite direction. (Yes, I know he did the smart thing, but still: Fuck him)

I, being a tall, uncoordinated motherfucker, struggled to keep my balance as my dog jumped off, but he tipped the paddle board too far. So I ended up pinwheeling off the paddleboard and landing RIGHT ON THE MOTHERFUCKING SNAKE.

I went under for a second or two, certain it would sink it’s fangs into me at any point, before surfacing again. (In reality, it wriggled against me for like a second, and then swam away.) Immediately I swam for the paddle board, cursing madly. The snake was nowhere to be seen, probably noping the hell out of there, heading back for its muddy hidey-hole. 

I could still feel that initial moment of shock when I hit the water, certain I was dead, but adrenaline probably made it way worse than it was. From there, I high tailed it back to the boat house, where Dingus the Dog sat on the dock, panting innocently and waiting for me. He knew what he did, betraying me like that, but I can never prove it to anyone. Not my family or friends or even you guys, but he did it on purpose. Totally and unequivocally. 

And to top everything off, just as I came up to the dock, my dog stood up and tried to hop on the paddle board again, but this time I tilted it so he fell in the water. Revenge is a bitch, you big, yellow baby, and I will never forget this. 

TL;DR I went paddle boarding with my goofy lab, a snake slithered out from the bank, my dog betrayed me and jumped off the board, I fell on top of the snake, and almost died.

*EDIT: As many of you pointed out, yes, the snake probably wasn't venomous given I was in Northern GA. And another good point you made was that snakes probably can't strike from the water. Both of these are valid points, but try to see where I'm coming from: Wobbly paddleboard. Giant, marshmallow-brained dog. Danger noodle swimming right for me. Lanky-ass me struggling not to tip in. It doesn't matter if it was just a harmless water snake, I still got the hell out!"
"TIFU by thinking my elderly neighbour was dead.


This was a couple of years ago. I lived next to an old woman - a pretty intimidating West Indian lady, who after just a week of me living there, shouted at me about some vines that were growing on our shared garden wall. I tried smiling a couple of times when I saw her outside but she just glowered at me, so I just kept my head down after that.

Anyway... after being there a few months I started hearing a dripping. Like she hadn't turned off one of her taps, and this noise was still there the next day and the day after. I started to get a bit worried about her so I knocked on the door... no answer. Looked through the letter box and through the windows - couldn't see any sign of her so I decided to ring the police. If she'd had a fall and needed help, and I hadn't done anything then I'd feel awful so...
I explained to the police that I don't know the woman, and she could be on holiday for all I know but she was pretty old and there's been a tap dripping for days and no one is answering the door. 

I'm not sure what response I was expecting but they sent two police cars, an ambulance and a fire engine. Which is enough to completely shut down a narrow English terraced street. They kicked her front door down, in front of everyone who lived on the street who had all come out to see what was happening, then broke into a bedroom door that was also locked and... it turns out that she was on her holidays.

They actually left a note on the door saying the next door neighbour had called the police. Grassed me right up!
She gets back from her holiday, her front door is a mess, and comes straight round to my place, going absolutely fucking dingy. I explained why I called the police and she said ""What's it to you if I'm dead? What the police going to about that? I don't need no help if I'm dead.""

EDIT: For those asking, I would call the police again in the same scenario. Also... I've since moved home so it'll be a whole new door for them to kick down! 

EDIT 2 - Clarifications:

The dripping: It was coming from a boiler - not sure how that translates outside of England but it's the unit that powers the central heating system (not an AC unit but rather a hot water system that warms the radiators and hot water that comes out of the taps). I didn't actually see it but the police told me it was that rather than a tap making the noise. There was already a bucket or something underneath and I think it was the drops hitting the build up of water in there that I could hear.

The house: It was a terraced house rather than flats/apartments so I'm not sure she even had a landlord for me to call - she could have owned the house. Her kitchen led out onto the garden and the boiler was in the kitchen. I could only hear the noise from my garden and once, I knew to listen for it, also from my bedroom with the window open (it overlooked the gardens). I couldn't hear it from anywhere else inside the house.

TL;DR Heard a dripping for several days, thought my elderly neighbour was hurt or dead, called the police and they kicked her door down. She was on holiday.

"Tifu by throwing a cigarette butt into some horse shit


Well this was actually last night but still worth posting. So here's some background. I live in the city so I'm not used to how dry everything is out in the desert where my mom lives. I went out to visit her for a few days to help clean up the horse pens and get her horses ready to be moved. She has a space set aside for all of the horse crap to go until it piles up then she has a tractor come to move it all at once.

 So I'm out there cleaning the round pen and I stopped to take a much needed cigarette break. After I'm done without thinking I flick the cigarette into the pile of dried out horse shit and get back to work. I finish up and go inside for some dinner and then go to bed. 
 
 The next morning  I woke up(being about 45 minutes ago) and went out to smoke another cigarette. I'm standing out front and I smell smoke. ""Who's BBQing at 4:30 in the morning"" I thought. And then I thought ""god that smells like shit, like litteral shit"" that's when it hit me that maybe it's coming from the backyard. So I went back there and sure enough 2 tons of horse shit is in a firey blaze smoke everywhere. So I spent the next 30 minutes spraying water on it and shoveling it around to put it out. 

 Long story short, don't throw cigarette butts into dry horse shit.

 TL;DR I threw a cigarette into some horse shit and almost burned my mom's house down"
"TIFU by not using a guitar pick.


This happened about 7 months ago. I was playing my guitar at an acoustic gig at the local cafe. So while a lot of people use guitar picks, I prefer to use my hands because I like the feel of it and I feel more comfortable with it. I had been growing my nails for a while so it was fine with me. 

While I was performing a song with a fast strumming pattern (Wake me up - Avicii), my lower E string got stuck in my nail making a weird noise and I felt a sharp pain in my index finger. I instantly  stopped playing and bent down grabbing my hand. When I looked at my hand I saw that the nail on my index finger was torn like paper and was pulled halfway back. I let out a scream and one of the ""cue guys"" came to my aid. I could hear people whispering stuff like ""Oh my god that looks horrible"" and stuff.

It hurt like a bitch and I went offstage for about twenty minutes. The pain was coming and going as the nail was moving. I asked them to put a rough dressing over it, some cotton and betadine. I asked for a pick and finished the song, horribly so.

My mates took me to the ER and the doctor numbed my finger and pulled the nail straight out, felt a little pain still. Had a bulb shaped dressing on my finger for about 5 weeks. 

[TL;DR] Didn't use a pick to play the guitar, nail got stuck in a string and got shredded, had a bulb shaped dressing on my finger for a month.

EDIT: For everyone asking for evidence, I managed to dig this up from my old phone, it's shaky/blurry because it was taken while I was in the ER lobby thingy going to get looked at. http://imgur.com/a/W4hx2
I can't believe I just spent the last twenty minutes trying to find a picture to post on the internet to convince strangers that my story is real.
