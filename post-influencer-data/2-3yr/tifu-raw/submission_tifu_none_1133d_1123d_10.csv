"TIFU by pretending not to be Korean


So I'm Korean-Canadian but was born in Canada and have grown up here my entire life. I ""speak"" Korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny Canadian accent.

Fuck-up happened yesterday. I’m walking down the sidewalk and who I assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in Korean over a directory sign. I ask (in Korean) if they need any help. The dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks Korean. The girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" They’re looking for a nearby mall so I offer to walk them over there since the train station I need is nearby anyway.

The dad asks me where I learned to speak Korean so well. This is where the fuck-up begins. I'm pretty insecure about my spoken Korean, so when the dad asks where I learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it’s obvious I’m not “actually” Korean. It doesn’t help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and I want to impress her for some reason. So, I lie. Stupid idea. I say I’m actually Chinese and learned Korean on my spare time, changing my skills from “mediocre for a Korean person” to “impressive for a Chinese person.”

Alas, the dad immediately switches to Mandarin which I can’t speak a word of. This would have been the time to come clean. Instead, panicking at having been exposed, I do my best confused face and then pretend I misspoke and said the Korean word for “Chinese” (Jung-guk) when I in fact meant “Japanese” (Ilbon). Ha-ha, sorry, my Korean isn’t very good, right?

Of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited Japanese, which I also can’t speak a word of. I’m in too deep at this point and can’t tell them I’m Vietnamese or some other variety of Asian without making myself even more suspicious, so I do the only logical thing and say I am indeed Japanese but don’t actually speak Japanese (but learned Korean cuz lol I’m a traitor to my Japanese heritage).

We reach the mall and I’m all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect English – damn polyglots) what I do. I say I go to the local university. She excitedly tells me that she’s starting at the same university in September, and that she has just arrived in Canada from Korea. Her “dad” seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to Korea.

It turns out that the girl is actually Japanese but went to some exchange program in Korea for a few years, and that the “dad” is actually her Chinese-born Korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to Canada. So, not only did I pretend not to be Korean to two people who weren’t even Korean, but I pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man and have now convinced a Japanese girl that I’m Japanese.

So I exchanged contact information with the girl and we’ve been talking a lot online since yesterday. Turns out she’s super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. We have a ton in common too. We have the same major, and we’re the same age, though she’s three years behind me because of her exchange program. She seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn’t know anybody in Canada and has been talking to me a lot. I’m becoming increasingly aware that I can’t pretend to be Japanese forever to this girl and I need to tell her I’m actually Korean, but early on she asked me about my family and I went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from Kyoto (picked a random city), etc. I've done fucked up, Reddit, and I feel terrible about it.

**TL;DR:** Am Korean, pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man, then pretended to be Japanese to an awesome Japanese girl and am now her first friend in Canada (based on a dirty lie).


**EDIT:** OHHH FUCK I THINK SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT BUT I'M NOT SURE AND I HAVEN'T COME CLEAN YET HELP

**EDIT 2 (Night of the 2nd Day):** Thank you all for the sage advice. I have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. I'm sure she'd oblige me and do the beheading part.
Anyway, I do think we're going on a date tomorrow and I thought I should come clean in person rather than over text. Will keep you all updated (unless I die). I haven't even been on a date in over two years so that's already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. As some have pointed out, I am kinda concerned that she's only interested in me because she thinks I'm Japanese, but I think that's more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (Canada) when her first friend is a fellow Japanese person. Maybe I'm terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. In any case, I'll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there's no solving that completely). Wish me luck in as many languages as you can, Reddit. Gamsahamnida.

Also: they don't use Reddit much in Japan and Korea, do they? I'd hate to be busted via a Reddit thread Q_Q

**EDIT 3 (Still Night of the 2nd Day)**: OH FUCK GUYS I FUCKED UP AGAIN. I was afraid she might stumble upon this post so I asked her if she has heard of Reddit cuz I'm a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and I just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she's gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am I so stupid.

DON'T LIE, KIDS. LYING IS VERY VERY BAD.

**EDIT 4 (Still Night of the 2nd Day):** Okay I think crisis averted for now. She just went to sleep without any sign of having read this. I'm also going to attempt to sleep and hope I wake up Japanese. Will update. Sayonara, Reddit."
"TIFU by injecting myself with Leukemia cells


Title speaks for itself. I was trying to inject mice to give them cancer and accidentally poked my finger. It started bleeding and its possible that the cancer cells could've entered my bloodstream.

Currently patiently waiting at the ER.

Wish me luck Reddit.

Edit: just to clarify, mice don't get T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) naturally. These is an immortal T-ALL from humans.

Update: Hey guys, sorry for the late update but here's the situation:
Doctor told me what most of you guys have been telling me that my immune system will likely take care of it. But if any swelling deveps I should come see them. My PI was very concerned when I told her but were hoping for the best. I've filled out the WSIB forms just in case.

Thanks for all your comments guys. 

I'll update if anything new comes up"
"TIFU telling special students that Jack Black is a role model of a successful down syndrome person


I work as a TA for instrument performance and composition in school, and I volunteered for teaching a special ed class with mostly 12~18 y/o? down syndrome students about piano, guitar and singing. 

I didn't know how to deal with these kids while supervisor was observing, but they pretty much went along cluelessly for whatever I said. One kid asked me ""How can we be good?"" and I kind of got saddened by the fact that the kid was aware that he won't be capable to achieve what people with normal mentality can achieve, and wanted to brighten them up whether or not if that was the reason why the kid asked or not. But I pretty much had to bullshit all the way and stall since I couldn't think of any successful people with mental disability except the McDonald's worker with down syndrome who retired that I saw on Reddit.

So I just quickly ran down my memory to find a famous person who looks like a disabled person, and came up with Jack Black. Then I played some video clips of him and told how successful he is.

Next few weeks they went full-on pro-Jack Black and now the classroom has a portrait frame of him above and watch his movies for ""Motivation"". Everyday they ask me to play Wonderboy. They want to write a letter to him and invite him to the school. I've done it, I'm fucked."
"TIFU by assaulting a small child


Okay, so I posted this yesterday, but my formatting was all kinds of fucked up so they took it down.
     Anyway here's the story:
     So I'm the general manager at an upscale(ish) Japanese steakhouse. The kind of place where they do the hibachi grill in front of you and charge you $20 for a plate that's 75% rice. Anyway, it's Friday night. We're balls to the wall busy and, like most restaurants on a Friday night, everything is generally chaos. I currently don't have an assistant manager, so at any one time I'm doing 8,000 different things by myself. So fast forward to the peak of our rush tonight. We have a group of 25 eight year olds show up to eat for one of the little fuckers birthdays. That's 25 eight year olds that are being supervised by 4 adults... In other words it's pretty much my worst fucking nightmare. 
      So I'm running around trying to make sure the other 150+ customers are being taken care of while all these prepubescent little shits are treating my restaurant like its a god damn chuck e cheeses. Meanwhile the 4 adults are at the bar drinking, presumably because they've been put in charge of 25 demonic hell spawns. At this point I'm so busy that I don't even have time to be concerned about these little demons or the worthless parents that should be trying to control them. 
       I'm standing in the lobby when I see a waitress flag me down from across the room. I'm making my way through the crowd that's amassed in the lobby and I'm moving at a pretty brisk pace. Suddenly I have one of the hostesses behind me shout me name and I do very abrupt 180 to turn around and see what they need. It was in this 180 turn that apparently I forgot how to control my arms. I turned around so quickly that my arm swung out in a weird kind of sweeping arc and the large faced, very heavy, metal watch that was on my wrist makes the most solid contact imaginable with this eight year olds forehead. I hit that kid so hard I half expected someone to pop out of the crowd and yell ""WORLDSTAR!"". My watch actually cut the kid when it hit him, so he's laying on the ground bawling and bleeding everywhere, I'm just standing there staring at the kid in shock, and the kids dad (who just happened to be one of the 4 adults) has now left the bar and is making a bee-line right for me and his concussed 8 year old. 
      The guy immediately gets in my face and starts screaming at me for hitting his kid. At this point I'm still trying to be all about customer service and I'm trying to calmly and politely explain that it was an accident and I'm extremely sorry. The dad continues to be a massive asshole, accusing me of assaulting a child and threatening to call the police. Finally I just snapped. I always treat customers with respect and kindness even when they're being belligerently douchey, but I just couldn't deal with this guy. I blow up on him, and ask him what kind of shitty father sits at a bar drinking while a horde of children he's responsible for run around a restaurant unsupervised. I tell him that if he gave a shred of a shit about his kid he would've been watching him and this never would've happened. At this the father becomes irate. He starts screaming about what a shitty restaurant we are and about what a shitty manager I am. He grabs his kid (who's still crying and bleeding) by the arm, yanks him off the ground and proceeds to storm outside, streaming a slew of profanity as he leaves. 
     About 15 minutes pass when suddenly two police officers walk in with this guy riding their coat tails like he's hot shit. The police come to question me and they're very curious as to why I ""would punch a child in the face"". I explain to them it was all a complete accident and a total misunderstanding. I explain how everything was caught on the restaurants security cameras and I'd be happy to show them the footage. They watched it, agreed that it was a total accident, and cleared me of any wrong doing. When the cops go to leave without me in handcuffs the father becomes absolutely furious and starts screaming at me and the police officers in the middle of the lobby. The cops begin to explain to the man he needs to calm down before they're forced to do something. This makes him even more mad. Then I mention to the police officers how the guy never paid for the drinks he had at the bar and how he just walked out on his tab. (Now I realize I may have caused brain damage to his child and I probably could've just let him have the drinks to compensate, but fuck that guy.) When I accuse the guy of walking out on his tab it becomes too much for his insignificant little mind to bare and he snaps. He lunges at me, swings, and totally misses. I jump out of the way as the cops take the guy down and slap the handcuffs on him. The police then dragged him out the front door while he was screaming at everyone he could possibly scream at and that was the last we saw of him. At least for tonight anyway.


TL,DR: I run a restaurant. Large group of unsupervised little shits show up. 8 year old little shit's not paying attention to me, I'm not paying attention to him. In a whirlwind of fast paced movement my large metal watch collides with his face and basically knocks him the fuck out. Little fucker's shit stick of a father flips out. Chaos ensues. 



Edit: I just got off work and saw that this was front page, so that's pretty dope. I guess I should say thanks for that? I never really thought so many people would be overjoyed by me hulk-smashing a child into oblivion, but the lord works in mysterious ways. 
         To everyone asking how exactly I fucked up I would refer to the part where I unleashed the watch of wrath on a child's forehead. And I might not have finished that business degree I started, but I'm pretty sure your general manager Kimbo Slicing a youngling isn't good for business. Also my job might not exactly be safe if this guy talks to a lawyer. Although that might not be all bad, because fuck managing a restaurant, am I right? It's pretty much the closest thing to hell.
         And to everyone bitching about my formatting.
Eat a bag of syphilitic dicks, I manage a fucking restaurant for a living. Do you really expect a literary masterpiece? Be happy I even attempted to make paragraphs. 
         But thanks again for the whole front page thing and all the discussions about child clubbing. That's pretty cool.



Edit 2:
And to everyone saying I'm a shitty manager for going off on that guy, go fuck your own face. In the 4 months since I took over our rating has increased across all social media, we've been making more money, and our service is regularly complimented. And I'm in charge of an entire restaurant at 23, so fuck you. I've got plenty of wiggle room for experience and lesson learning in my life/management career.


Edit 3:
Harambe. Never forget.

Last edit: 
I saw where someone gilded me, so I will say the customary thank you for that. As is tradition."
"TIFU By attaching a suction cup dildo to my forehead. [NSFW]


My fiancée and I have gotten a couple new things to try out in the bedroom lately. One of them is a dildo with a suction base. Her and I also have the mental age of 10 and were waving around the floppy pink fun rod within minutes of getting it. 


The obvious next step was to try and stick it to things. The knee worked, chest didn't, and she had a failed attempt on her forehead. Being the one-upper I am, I proceeded to slap that fucker onto my forehead and show her how it's done. Suction was achieved.


After about three minutes of prancing around and slapping things with my dickhorn, I decided to remove it. As soon as I start pulling it off I can tell something is wrong. The rubber stick of love formed a special bond with my forehead, wanting to live out its life with its new best friend.


After some struggling I managed to pull it off with an  audible pop. My fiancée immediately had an 'oh shit' look on her face.


 ""babe, your forehead is purple.""


 I ran into the bathroom to look at it, and it actually wasn't too bad. I figured it would fade quickly.  I thought I had lucked out...


Fast forward one sex later, and my fiancée is again staring at my forehead. ""Oh my God, it's a lot darker."" I went back to the bathroom and yeah, that shit definitely bruised pretty badly. I now have a dildo-caused bruise on my forehead that I'm hoping goes away before I go back to work on Monday. At a bank.

"TIFU by making a dad joke


So today (wow, today!) I was at my cousin's birthday party. He's still really young, he was turning 6. (For reference, I am 16, too old for a kids party but too young to sit with the adults and drink beer) We go to a bowling alley where they do kids parties, and everything is going well, I get a few strikes, everyone's happy. 

Then we go into the party room, where we are served the food. You can imagine how out of place I felt, towering over these tiny kids as we eat ""food"" with plastic cutlery and the mandatory party hat on our heads. The other kids realise this too. The little girl who I was facing looks at me inquisitively.

Little Girl: ""Excuse me. How old are you?""

Me: Sixteen.

LG: Oh. I'm Seven.

Me: Hi Seven, I'm Dad.

Her eyes widen, almost as if they were going to pop right out of her head and bail, and a look of absolute euphoria spreads across her face. She jumps up and runs to me, hugging me, kissing whatever part of me she could reach, saying ""Oh daddy! I've missed you! Where have you been?"" 

Me, confused as all hell, looks at the adults for some kind of support / explanation, and I was met with mostly disappointed or angry looks. One particular angry look was from this little girl's mother. She storms up to me, grabs her daughter, and walks off. They talk in the corner for a minute, and the little girl bursts into tears. Mother and daughter exit the building. 

My mum looks at me with complete disdain, and asks me why the fuck I said what I had said (all adults were close by, within hearing distance of the little girl and I). I told her that I thought it was kind of funny, and it might make her laugh. She shakes her head and tells me the story.

This little girl's dad did a walkout several months after she was born. Her parents were fighting, the dad was an alcoholic, and after one particularly nasty argument, he packs his stuff and straight up bails on the family. The girl was too young to remember her father's appearance, but treasures the memory of his presence. When I said I was her dad, all she wanted to do was believe her dad was back, despite the unlikeliness and improbability of it. 

In other words, I broke her fucking heart. 

I am now sitting at home, contemplating my previous decisions, privately resolving to not show my face amongst my extended family for a while, and feeling like the worst human being to have lived. 

**TL;DR** If you make a dad joke without being a dad, it must be bad karma or something because I convinced a basically fatherless child I was her dad.

**Edit** Thank you all for the words of support / the proper delivery of a dad joke. I should have indeed said my own name, that would have saved me from a bit of pain. For those telling me to send an apology note, I could but it would seem out of place. She never knew my actual name, she was just another girl amongst 20 or so other kids, and not a part of my family, just a friend of my cousin's. And for those asking, I won't be hooking up with the girl's mum. I feel bad saying that she *wasn't* hot, I'm sure she was in her day. Right now she just looks worn and tired.

"TIFU by forgetting about potatoes


For the past 3 weeks I've had a horrible cough, and have had nausea ever time I've been in my 1 bedroom apartment. Every single time I walked into it, I always got hit by this ammonia like smell that I thought were cleaning supplies. 

I've been having to keep all my doors and windows open, which sucks because I live in a hot area and I can't turn on the A/C doing so. And at night when I go to bed and close everything, I start coughing horribly. 

Last night I was putting away stuff I got from the grocery store. I was trying to find a place to put something and I opened a drawer... I was hit by this super strong odor that made me start coughing and retching immediately. I walked away, went outside, and felt like I was about to pass out. 

A few minutes later, I went back in, held my breath, and saw that I left a dozen small potatoes in there. I was told to keep them in a cool, dry place and I thought a drawer would be that.

Apparently not, they were all moldy, and that mold leaked into the wooden drawer. I picked them up, threw them out down the garbage chute, and have been aerating my apartment while I'm at work.

About a year ago, [I read this story](http://archive.is/cbmbR) about how rotting potato gas killed almost an entire family. I assume that's whats been making me sick (I hope at least, because then I found the problem). I'm going to get my blood checked in a few days because my lungs hurt.

**TL:DR**: In Latvia, even having potato can kill you.

**edit** My highest rated post after reddit'ing for 2 years is about potatoes.

**edit 2** Some people have suggested Carbon Monoxide. Whats a good, cheap detector? I live in a multi-unit apartment so would it just apply to me, or to the entire building?

**edit 3** Was just informed that carbon monoxide is a meme. The detector I ordered will be a just in case!"
"TIFU and Made it Rain Porn on my Mom. NSFW, to be safe, not sorry.


This fuck-up happened almost half my lifetime ago when I was young, stupid, and still lived at home. 


For background, in high school I lived in a mostly finished basement room of my mom's house with a loft bed and a drop-ceiling. I also had a job that allowed horny teenaged me to amass a large trove of porn magazines and a small handful of videos on the sly.  

Envisioning myself to be a clever little shit, I stashed my ill-gotten gains by popping up a tile in the ceiling near my bed  and storing them in the gap between the drop ceiling and the actual ceiling.    
Being a lazy little shit who didn't want to use a ladder or stool to have to search more than one place for what I was looking for, I had everything stacked atop the same tile next to my bed.  
Eventually, the collection grew to the point where, if you knew to look for it, you could actually see that tile bowing, as it struggled valiantly under the weight of my wank bank.  


Time went on, I graduated, and prepared to move out to college. I had my doubts about the feasibility of bringing twenty plus pounds of porn with me, and besides, I had built my own PC at this point, so I left my hoard behind, assuming it would be as safe up there as it had always been.  

Fast forward almost a month when I get a phone call from my mom.  
""Hi LWVR"", she says, sounding a bit bubbly, even for her cheery self.  
""Hi mom, how's it going?"" I asked, wondering what was up.   
""Goood... listen, I was trying to clean the house up a bit to see if I can sell it, finish the basement, that kind of thing""   
""Yeah?"" *The basement? Shit, I wonder if she found it*  
""and I went to take down the drop ceiling in your room,"" she continues, a wry tone in her voice.   
""fuck..."" I whisper under my breath.  
""Something like that,"" she replies, still chipper. ""turns out when I got about halfway down the room, I took one of the supports down and the whole rest of the ceiling and a lot of magazines just collapsed on top of me.""  
""On top of you? Shit, are you alright?""  
""I'm fine, just don't think any of this will be here when you get back, and I thought you'd want to hear the story.""  
""Sorry, mom...""  

And that's the story about how I lost my high school porn stash when it avalanched onto my mom along with half my ceiling, scaring the shit out of her, but leaving her ultimately uninjured.  
  
tl;dr: Op's Porn Pours over Parent."
"TIFU by accidentally making my employees think their supervisor had died


Always have loved reading TIFUs, never thought I would have to submit one...happened this week. 

Just for context, I work at a fairly large hospital (but small enough and old enough where mostly everyone knows each other) as a director.  I have a few managers and supervisors that work varying shifts. These supervisors directly oversee about 100 staff members all together. In our department, news spreads like wildfire. For example, I came in on an off shift recently and saw one employee when I walked through the door. 10 minutes later, the whole department knew I was in and everyone ~~got up from their hiding spots~~ was hard at work as I walked the building. 

One of the supervisors, Lisa, just couldn't handle the job. Things weren't getting done, didn't have respect from or control of her staff, etc. I had spoke with her on several occasions about these concerns and nothing was improving. Sadly, it was time for her to move on. Met with HR, wrote out the termination. Dreaded it all day. Finally it was time to meet with her and deliver. It went pretty well. She understood and thanked me for all of the support and working with her. Great! That is now over. Still a sad situation. 

We walked out. She said goodbye. I go back to HR just to debrief and HR suggested that I go around and inform the employees who are working of the situation. Typically HR is very ""walk a fine line-ish"" and obviously says I can't let them know the details or reason she was let go. Just told me to state something along the lines of ""she is no longer with the organization."" Blah blah blah. 

Here is the FU:

I think to myself, I should probably hold a quick huddle and let everyone know at the same time since this will spread after I tell one person. I would like everyone to hear it from me first instead of an out of control game of telephone
(In hindsight this would have worked out better). 

It was a long stressful day. I thought, what the hell, I'll just go and talk to each employee since having everyone gather for a huddle would be a task in itself and I really could use some exercise. Plus, I don't think anyone will take it too hard. 

1st person I see. 

Hey, how has your day been? How is your family, etc. Well hey, I'm just coming around to let you know Lisa **is no longer with us**

His response surprised me at this moment. He said something like "" oh my gosh, what happened?"" I obviously said I wasn't able to speak about it. He also stated ""I just talked to her yesterday"" shaking his head. Again, I thought nothing of this at the time. Multiply this conversation with about 25 others. 

Alright, phew. That is over with. Kind of surprised that everyone seemed to take it so hard. It starts to click as I'm driving home. They think **she died.** Maybe I wasn't specific enough. 

Maybe not. I'm just overthinking it. 

NOPE. Later that night I start to receive text from Lisa asking what the hell is happening. She is receiving texts from employees and friends now at this point. Employees have started leaving messages on her Facebook page saying RIP. This is seen by all of her Facebook friends.

She now will have to tell all of her friends and family that she was let go to explain this misunderstanding. I feel terrible about it. I've apologized to her, the staff, pretty much anyone I see in passing at work. 

TL;DNR: fired someone and proceeded to accidentally explain it to staff where they thought she has died. now she has to explain to everyone she knows that she was fired and definitely not dead


**EDIT**: Wow, a lot of comments I'll have to read through tonight! Just as an update, I did meet with the department and cleared the air. Obviously, everyone was already aware that she was not, in fact, dead. I have since talked to her again and she found another position! She was all shits and giggles about the whole situation. She said it made it easier in retrospect. 

I'm sure after I read through the comments I'll post an update to clear any questions up. 

Also corrected here to *hear* just so I don't have to read another comment about it.

"TIFU by packing several jars of spices with my books and electronics.


I packed them into one suitcase to take on a flight with me to college. The spice jars broke. All my books, my tablet, and my microphone are now coated in garlic powder and who knows what else. Garlic powder has a very strong smell. There's no real way to clean it out of a book or off of a tablet because it's fine-grain and using water would be a bad idea. So my books and electronics all just reek of garlic. They're still coated in copious amounts of the stuff. Life is suffering."
"TIFU by accidentally playing ""Born to Be Wild"" at my Grandfather's funeral


I was put in charge of the music playlist for my Grandfather's funeral, which consisted of quite beautiful classical and choir music selected by my Grandmother. I had everything set up in playlists on my Spotify account and felt a little nervous but prepared. I started to play the first playlist as people entered, but what I didn't realize is that the ""Up Next"" feature overrides the playlist feature, so instead of playing the next classical song in the playlist, my phone started to blare ""Born to Be Wild"". I heard it as I walked in and luckily cut it off, but not before I heard a few chuckles."
"TIFU by throwing my shit through my girlfriend's bathroom window.


So, after reading the steak-to-the-window TIFU I felt I had to share this with y'all, after all, it's kinda similar. Kinda.

This didn't happen today, it went down around seven years ago (but it still feels like it happened yesterday, i'm 23 btw). I warn you, the amount of cringe contained in this TIFU is over 9 fuckin thousand. Also, English isn't my native language, so please don't be jerks about my grammar.

This story begins on my girlfriend's couch. She lived in a big house outside the city with her parents and we had been dating for around 2 months, so the relationship was great and we were in that phase were everything feels like eating an entire double cheese pepperoni pizza in the middle of the night while high or drunk (for vegans it's like eating grass, i guess). Anyways, we're cuddling and watching an episode of friends, when all of a sudden I feel it. It's a fucking freight train sliding down my rectum and it won't stop for nothing.

Just so you know, I'm the kind of person who just can't take a shit unless I'm at my crib and there's a good amount of silence. Public places and specially my girlfriend's house is a big nope for me, but I just couldn't hold this one any longer.

Fastforward to the part where I'm in the bathroom finishing my delivery (which went great, to tell you the truth). It was one of those shits for which you don't need to wipe more than once because it's too compact to leave anything behind and also let's you get out of the bathroom in a very small amount of time, except this time the fucking toilet betrayed me and didn't flush. The toilet's tank had no water.

I turn on the hand washer and it works, so I start trying to fill the tank carrying water with my hands. It won't work. I'm getting all the floor wet and it will take an eternity and a half. I'm panicking now. I don't want this to be my first impression at her house and I'm running out of options. I tilt my face to the sky to pray for help and suddenly I see the light, which is passing through a small rectangular window near the ceiling. I open it, lift myself up and see that there are plants on the outside. Without thinking too much about the fucking risk, I grab my brown son and throw it out the window. Success! They won't be able to smell it and it will also feed the plants, so as far as i'm concerned, i'm doing them a favor.

I wash my hands and head to the couch again, only to hear my girlfriend's mother downstairs screaming my girlfriends name at the top of her voice and then shouting ""both of you get the fuck over here!!!"". FUCK. As I follow her downstairs, my head's panicking, I know something must have gone wrong with my shit but at the bottom of my heart I still have faith that maybe her mom is screaming about something else. 

We find her mom standing besides the maid in the laundry patio (which is a room right beside the house with a sliding roof and a door that faces the garden where the maid does the laundry and hangs the clothes on sunny days) AND I SEE MY SHIT LYING ON TOP OF THE WASHING MACHINE. ""What the fuck is this shit!!!"" shouted the mother (that didn't sound funny at the moment). Now I'm assuming the maid witnessed the whole thing and is in a state of shock. I look at GF's mom and then at my girlfriend, who looks at me as if I'm a monster, I can see the love in her eyes gradually vanishing. My reaction to this situation is to turn around while saying ""noooooooo no no no no"" and head to the house entrance to get the fuck out of that place. My girlfriend shouts my name as I'm escaping, to which I responded ""no no no no!!"". I run to my car, turn on the engine and book it as they are running out with a wtf face.

That was it. I wasn't mature or intelligent enough to just say to my girlfriend that the fucking toilet wasn't working and instead took the worst possible decision of my life.

I'll upload a drawing of the house later so that you can understand better the layout of the house.

TL;DR 

Went to my girlfriends bathroom to take a shit, toilet didn't flush, decided to throw my shit out the window on some plants, landed on top of her family's washing machine.

EDIT:

The drawing I promised with a short comic :)

For those asking if we kept in touch or something: Well, we certainly did not. I actually closed my myspace account (through which we met) and reopened my msn messenger account with a new email. For quite a while, I wasn't able to chill in public places because the thought of running into her or some friend or member of her family would be permanently present, It wasn't pleasant at all. Luckily that hasn't happened up to this day, though I'm sure if it did, I'd just turn around and run while shouting ""no no no no""."
"TIFU by accidentally suggesting an inappropriate acronym for a Christian camp and giving our church a bad name.


So this wasn't actually today as lots of these stories are, but anyway in January this year I attended a  Christian camp, called “leaders in training” or (LiT) with six other people from my church. The camp is aimed at late teens helping them to learn how to lead events in local churches and what not. Anyway the camp is pretty big and lots of different “types” of Christians were there, some who are very strict and conservative, others who are not as much.

On the first night our church group is sitting together in the main hall waiting for the main teaching/service to begin for the night. One of my friends mentions to me how he thinks the name wasn’t very well thought out. The camp likes to seem modern to the younger generation and had a large social media presence using the hashtag “Lit”. Upon viewing the hashtag half the results were photos of people at the camp, or posts concerning it, and the other half was of people smoking weed.

Here’s where I mess up. I respond to my friend that “I agree, the name is misleading and suggests something they no doubt wouldn’t like to be associated with, and even if you ignore that, the name doesn’t even suggest it’s a Christian camp”
Here it comes…
“It’s a bad acronym, they should have just called it “Christian Leaders in Training” instead.”

It took about two second before my friend and I realised why this wouldn’t be a suitable replacement. After these two seconds my friend bursts out laughing, arousing the interest of the rest of my church group (no pun intended).
He then explains the conversation to the rest of the church group. They were also amused, however one of my friends didn’t understand why this was inappropriate and says (quite loudly) “Clit? Why is that so funny? What’s wrong with Clit?”

The thirty or so people around our little group, who have just heard this question completely out of context, give our group some very upset and indignant looks.

So it’s night one and our little church group gets a bad rep thanks to my lack of thinking before speaking.

TL;DR Accidentally gave my church group a bad rep by suggesting the name of the camp should be changed to the shortened form of the word “clitoris”.

Edit: knew this would probably start a lot of religion hate, so far I'm relatively proud of the lack of chaos (Not a challenge). Also all these other examples of bad acronyms are great thanks for making me feel a little less stupid. Have a wonderful day people

Edit2: Yeah just removing the ""in"" would make a lot of sense for both the original name and my unfortunate suggestion

Edit3: My bad, to clarify bad rep wasn't just because people heard the word ""clit"", it was from the lack of context, essentially it seemed like I was telling dirty jokes and having a go at the name of the camp, instead of just our group laughing at my lack of thinking before talking. "
"TIFU by texting shots fired to my mom


So I guess i'll get right into it...It was the second to last day of High school and I was excited for summer and my upcoming first year of college. 

I was taking a college Speech course offered through my school and was therefore outside in trailers. The class was presenting our final speeches and after nailing my presentation on ancient artifacts in Egypt, I felt cocky and ready for college to start. We still had about an hour left in class and since I presented in the beginning, I had to wait for all my other classmates to go. 

I brought my phone out and started texting my some friends and my Mom. Meanwhile, this girl who my whole family particularly did not like, was presenting for the class on caffeine consumption and was butchering the whole thing, very cringe. I was letting my Mom know how bad she was doing in the hopes we could both for happiness in this girls misfortune. 

Unfortunately for me, my Mom thought it was hilarious and responded with a couple mean texts. Laughing while I read them, I responded with, ""shots fired."" For those of you who don't understand what that means, it is basically saying like oooooohhhhhhhhhh burrrrnnnnnnn. As soon as I sent that text however, I got in trouble for having my phone out and was asked to put it away which I did. I didn't hear the countless phone calls or the numerous texts. By the time I checked my phone five minutes later, I saw I had missed a bunch of calls and text messages. I checked my texts and saw my Mom freaking out asking if I was ok and that she had called the cops. I literally uttered, ""fuck"" in which my friend next to me turned and asked what was wrong. I didn't respond but raised my hand in the hopes I could be excused to go to the office and explain what happened before the swat team showed up. 

However someone new was now presenting and the teacher refused to call on me and kept on giving me a glare to put my hand down. I was about to just leave when the door opens behind me. Its our Vice Principal and a police officer. I am ushered out of the class and my friends are all thinking that i'm about to get arrested. I try explaining what happened, that my mom was making fun of a girl in a class and I responded with shots fired as a diss but they were furious and didn't understand. I was ushered into the office where I was met with with the eyes of the entire office staff staring me down. I was put into my vice principals office and awaited judgement. 

Now our vice principal is a pretty cool guy but I was still freaking out. When he came in, I tried explaining everything again and showed him the texts. However he still didn't understand the, ""shots fired"" meaning and proceeded to go onto Urban Dictionary to figure it out. He now finally understood it and started laughing. However I wasn't off the hook. Turns out the whole police force was ready to head to my school and the school was on lockdown. I wasn't getting off that easy, likely suspension. 

I started sweating bullets and saw my dreams of freedom at college slowly disappear. At this point the head

 principal came in and just started staring at me. It was literally like five minutes of him just staring at me and me staring back. Total alpha shit. He finally said, who do you think you are staring at"" in which I responded, ""I'm staring at you."" Obviously not helping my case. He proceeded to have me explain the story to him as well and he also didn't understand the whole, ""shots fired"" thing. 

He proceeded to tell me that this whole thing wouldn't of happened if I only I didn't use my phone during class. Ultimately they decided to let me cross the stage but gave me in-school suspension for a phone violation on my last day of highschool. When I drove home I saw my Mom crying on my porch because she though i was dead from a school shooting. Took a while to calm her down with lots of apologies. Felt like the worse child ever seeing my Mom cry like that. A couple years later, its kind of a joke in my family and we will always say shots fired when someone dissing another.

TL;DR 
Texted shots fired to my Mom, she called the police, I got in-school suspension and worst child of the day reward.

edit: my gosh, such anger for paragraphs and *principal "
