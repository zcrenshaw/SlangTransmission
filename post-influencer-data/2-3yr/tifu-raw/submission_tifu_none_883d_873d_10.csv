"TIFU by listening to my GF's obviously stupid game.


So, yesterday my girlfriend and I were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.

Now, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

Long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). Since yesterday, peeing still hurts. She thought I wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

TL;DR I fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**Edit**: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down, I am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well I hope you didn't). Sorry, I'm keeping it up. See you at 8."
"TIFU by spilling a massive amount of blood in a public park


So, my lady friend gets a call from her cousin saying he has a college film project due, but can't seem to get his fake blood to look just right. She is a theatre/ photography type, so she agrees to help him whip up some better stage blood. 

So we do, but its still not quite right. It looks perfect to the naked eye, but still not perfect on camera. 

So its getting pretty late. We decide to take the bottle home and work on adding a little more pigment to help it out. We were parked on the other side of a large park. At this pont it's almost 11pm and we haven't seen anyone the entire walk. 

As we are walking, I'm talking with my hands when I hit her arm and knock the bottle out of her hand on a concrete wheelchair ramp. 

The bottle splits open and every drop of ""blood"" pours out. All 32oz. It looked like a Tarantino flick. Its running down the ramp. Real horror show. 

But we're not too worried. First of all its threatening to rain, so we figure it will wash away. Also there aren't alot of people in the park. So we figure if nothing else we will get to the car, fill a bottle with water and go wash it down, if it doesn't rain before. 

We walk about 10 more minutes to the car, fill a bottle with water from the fountain and start driving back. Until we see the police SUV flying down the road toward us. Hauling ass, lights blazing

He hits us with the spotlight, but then turns it off and pulls into the nearest parking lot closest to the spill. I'm like ""we should tell him"" but she is a bit freaked out. So I say ""ok I'll pull into a good spot, leave you in the car and run and tell em what happened."" As soon as I pull over another cop in a cruiser pulls up and tells us we need to clear the area. I'm like ""well...I wanted to..."". And he drives off midsentence toward the other cop. 

Then another cruiser comes. This cop motions for us to leave. So we do as she said. I wasn't looking forward to talking to them anyway.

Not sure whatever came of it, but I'm sure they figured it out. 

TL,DR - Walking in a park. Carrying stage blood from a film project. Drop it. It goes everywhere. Looks like a slaughter has taken place. Police are summoned. We make our getaway. "
"TIFU by almost killing my coworkers


Like usual, this didn't actually happen today, but a while ago. 

My first job was working at a local pizza place, it was really chill to the point where it was pretty common for employees to be drunk and/or high while on the clock. One night, I (as the youngest on shift) was left to mop up the back room while everyone else was chilling on the patio for a bit since we were pretty much done for the night. Its pretty late at this point so I'm trying to fill up the bucket so I can start, and I see a couple of the many spray bottles we have lying around that are always full of some really mild cleaning solution. I was impatient and figured our mild cleaning solution would be fine mixed with bleach (which is what we were using on the floor) so I dumped the bottles in in an effort to fill the bucket faster.

Buckets full, dump in bleach, begin to mop.

A few minutes in, I start to notice that I'm feeling a bit lightheaded and nauseous, but I figure its just because I've been working for almost eight hours at this point without an actual break.

It's been probably 20 minutes or so since I was sent back to mop so one of my coworkers came back to check on me and they immediately noticed something was wrong, yell something about the smell. Mutual realization that something is definitely Wrong. Check the bottles, turns out I accidentally managed to find the one solitary bottle of vinegar thats used to scrub the oven and dumped that in with my bleach, thus making chlorine gas. Ended up having to air out the entire restaurant for probably 40 minutes. Luckily my manager thought it was kind of funny and was glad I didn't accidentally kill us.

tl;dr accidentally waged chemical warfare in restaurant kitchen



edit: a lot of people are saying something along the lines of ""never mix cleaning products dumbass!"" yeah i know i passed high school chemistry too; i was a tired 17 year old and i thought i was adding hella diluted dish soap (which i had seen be added before with absolutely no ill effects), not the one singular spray bottle of vinegar"
"TIFU by going to the wrong interview


Unlike normal tifu manner, this was actually today. Maybe an hour ago.

I'm turning 17 this month and was trying to get my second job ever. I applied to many places, and finally got a call back. I was told ""Go to chili's at 2 pm on friday"" this is where the fu begins.

I was excited for the interview, obviously, and told my parents and a couple friends about it. Finally the day is here, and I leave about 30 minutes early just in case. I go in, and the interviewer is taking quite a while, which is the first sign to me that something is wrong. He finally comes out, it all goes smoothly, but he says ""We aren't currently in much need of new team members, but you must've been called for a reason."" Second sign something's wrong. 

We shake hands and I leave, and I decided to check my calls. 

I look up the number to see which store it's for, as it didn't match the one I was at.

Except

It's not chili's at all

It was Tilly's.

So not only did I confuse some poor manager, I missed out on the real job opportunity. 

TL;DR: went to wrong interview, possibly missed out on job 

Edit: Geez, okay so I understand ""Rip my inbox"" now. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. I want to say thank you everyone for your advice, and maybe clear up a couple things.

I applied to both places, and they're within a few hundred feet of each other. I heard it wrong on the phone and mixed it up.

I called Tilly's as soon as I realized my mistake and let them know what happened.

Yes, I know it was dumb. 

I'll update when I figure out more.

Edit 2: To the people saying ""Call and explain, they might think it's funny."" They did.

Edit 3: Well, no one's really gonna see this now, but I have a second interview tomorrow. Wish me luck! "
"TIFU something that should be on the outside is now on the inside


This actually happened only a few hours ago. I was laying on the couch watching Wedding Crashers  this afternoon. Taking a well deserved break after my last final yesterday. 

When I watch movies I have a habit of putting my wedding ring in my mouth and flipping it between my lips and teeth with my tongue. I rarely even realize that I'm doing it. I let out a thunderous laugh during the ""notch on your belt"" line. 

My ring slid down into my throat and playing a dangerous game between my trachea and esophagus. And it chose my trachea. I sat up rapidly and coughed to clear it from my windpipe. It only moved enough to clear out of my trachea. But the ring was still sitting in the back of my throat. So when I reflexively swallowed the ring travelled down my esophagus and ended up nestling itself deep in my stomach. 

Immediately I realized my fuck up. Which was reiterated by the doctor at the hospital. ""Don't put anything in your mouth that you don't intend on consuming."" Thanks doc. 

Well now I have to poop sift. 


And tell my wife. 


Marriage is indeed a hard pill to swallow. 

TL;DR I swallowed my wedding ring and still haven't told my wife. 

Edit: I posted a comment down below with a link to the X-ray. 

Edit 2: For all who are interested. I have not told my wife yet. She is out of town. Will update when I tell her. 

Edit 3: For clarity. "
"TIFU By Putting Magnets Near My Dick [NSFW]


As usual, not today but a few years ago. Throwaway for sanity

Let's set the scene. It's 3AM in a basement in the middle of central Canada during the Winter. Acid Jazz is playing over a laptop with a few dongles attached various wires running off to a breadboard on my worn out wooden desk. Soft pings of messages constantly floating in from IRC channels and the smell of stale cigarettes fill the space.

I was cutting sleep to play around with some new sensors I had picked up, in this case a [Reed Switch [image]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Reedrelay.jpg). For those that aren't geeks, it's a device that detects the presence of a magnetic field completing the circuit only when near a magnet is near. I'm playing around with an Arduino and get it all set up with live graphing over the serial link thinking maybe I can use this for managing the timing of a [POV wheel on my bike or something](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/images/000/001/091/medium800/Bike-Wheel-POV-Display-adafruit-thumbnail.jpg?1448302256). My girl texts me some dirty stuff and suddenly I get a bright idea. [DICK SCIENCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics)

This is not the first time I've had this happen. In physics class I measured the height of my dick off the groud and came in a perfectly horizontal position to calculate the average velocity of my jizz (33KPH). Using this number later and a scale I even got the force of impact. 

Eyeing up the now-flat graph I pull out the two small cubed 1/2cm neodymium magnets I had ordered and loosen the buckle, throwing some porn on the other monitor to kickstart the process. Let the boys in IRC know what's going down and stand above the mess of wires ready for the sweet sweet data. Realizing this magnet won't stay in place I opt for placing the other magnet on the opposite side of my cock (it beat the duct tape). Surprised that the thing would stay in place with only minor deformation I start pumping away at air. 

The data starts flowing in, and graphs are being generated and everything is just peachy. A little sad that I didn't have a way to accurately measure over time and more focused on the graphs, my erection started to wane. And with that my foreskin rolls back on over dislodging the magnets. In a second the top one gets knocked off and falls the bottom however rolls under the skin. Then the wonderful force of magnetism sucks them back into each other making a wonderful foreskin sandwich.

[Ever heard of the Inverse Cube Law](https://media.quizizz.com/resource/gs/quizizz-media/questions/L2FwcGhvc3RpbmdfcHJvZC9ibG9icy9BRW5CMlVxTTFBeXJDSjY1aHVSOEN0TGl2b1JXUm5mdDk5TkNZZmN3ekVuNjVaMlA0T0ViV0x2MGhabWNRY19NQ0QwV0JqazJZeno1STJoUV9RdkZwUlhyQUlNVkVWeWgwQS5ib1UycWJ4YlZqTXU1Ym9f)? If not, the force between two magnets is greater the smaller it is. How thick is a squished foreskin?

**t=0**
I yelp, but mostly out of shock and try digging these magnets out of my cock. At first I dig some fingers in there but the precum is preventing me from getting a grip. Sitting down in my chair I tab on over to IRC and update the boys on my experimental developments while trying to figure out the next step. There's a few tools around me but the needlenose pliers and [vicegrip seem like good option](https://youtu.be/Vt8NOdINJ1s?t=46s). So I kick back in my chair, throw my legs on the desk and dive into my dick with two sets of needlenose pliers. Not regular ones, but the ones with super fine points for mounting SMD components. The things just can't hold onto the bits of metal and keep slipping around. After getting a solid grip and applying a ton of force, the thing slips off and nearly stabs a hole in my dick.

**t=20min**
I light a dart and ponder what the fuck I'm going to do, trying to avoid waking my dad up to run me to a hospital. Can I slide it out? Maybe? I'm losing feeling pretty quick so I decide to give it a shot. Grabbing my housecoat I slip upstairs and hop in the shower. Applying liberal amounts of soap to the area does absolutely fuck all. These magnets just can't be shook. While cleaning myself up and reconsidering my life choices, I decide to call in the big guns. 

**t=35min**
Now soaking wet I throw on my housecoat, grab the shop keys, spark a dart and head outside. It's the middle of Canadian winter out here 
(-35C (-31F)) and my nice wet hair starts freezing instantly, but the slippers keep everything warm for the short run. I get into the shop and stumble through the lawnmowers and welders in the dark to the light switch above the workbench. Reaching over the bench to where I think the switch is I hear a nick loud **click**.

**t=40min**
Good News: I found the [bench vice](http://l450v.alamy.com/450v/g3jcyk/old-blue-battered-bench-vice-g3jcyk.jpg).

Bad News: My dick is now stuck to the side of a metal bench vice.

I try to move the magnets around but the rough texture of the vice prevents it, I can't get a grip to pull them off and there's jack shit for other tools within reach. I take a pull from my dart and then I feel it. Slowly creeping through my cock is that sweet sweet Canadian winter, All -35C of it.

Thoughts start racing. There's no one awake within earshot, and within 10 minutes I'll have severe frostbite. Do I start screaming only for someone find me in the dark with my cock stuck to a workbench? Do I take it like a man and just die peacefully out here? Rip my cock off? I can't even bend to get under the bench. The way I see it, there's only one option with three outcomes. I'm going to have to rip my dick off this bench, that much is certain. The magnets might stay attached, stay attached to the bench and leave a gaping hole in my dick, or separate. 

I finish my dart and say a quick prayer. Closing my eyes I lean back throwing all my weight backwards and the cock stretches out like a taught violin string. Followed by a sharp pain.

**t=45min**
I start screaming, hands clamped around my cock. A few seconds later my body is filled with this amazing wave of relief (like orgasm but 40x better). And looking up I can just barely make out the outline of **one** of the magnets. Thank fucking Christ is all I can think fishing out the other one.

I managed to get minor frostbite but feeling returned to the area a few minutes later. The entire area was bruised in a perfect 1/2cm square. A few weeks later after it healed I'm still left with a discolored square on the bottom of my cock. A testament to curiosity and stupidity. 

I usually tell this story only when I'm really drunk, or someone notices the scar.

TL;DR Microelectronics lead to sweet dick scars

"TIFU by Making my wife think I was having an affair


As tradition in this sub this did not happen today but 10 years ago. I am now divorced but was still married at the time. Now on to the FU.

I had a corporate meeting with employee's from all over the US. Of course we introduce ourselves and shake hands as people come into the conference room. The meeting goes as planned and I present my portion. Meeting breaks up and hand shaking begins. Having drank a lot of coffee I was REALLY in need of the restroom. I march off to the restroom and this is the point of which I messed up. I did not was my hands before touching my junk - only after. What I did not think about was the women's perfume that I collected onto my hands and then transferred to my privates. That night the wife wanted to get frisky despite me having just arrived from the airport and exhausted. Of course she smelled the perfume and flipped out. She was convenced that I was pushing her off because I had an tryst instead of working an 80 hour week. To this day her dumb ass does not believe me but she it totally not my problem these days. [This wasn't the main reason for the divorce but an event that lead me to realize that something was off.]

TL;DR - shook hands with several ladies, transferred perfume to my privates during a bathroom break, and wife smelled the perfume.

Edit: 1 - 
 * Congratulations on thinking that everyone uses the same kind of perfume and no one uses their hand to smear it in. IDK if it was stinky lotion, oil, perfume or whatever.
* At this point in my life and with my ex completely gone I would have no problem admitting an affair. It would still make a good TIFU.
* To those saying I am lying and smells dont last more than a few hours I am baffled - this is not rocket science.
* Its easy to call FAKE and not back it up - harder to disprove to the fools online. 
* I just was reminded of this story because of something that occurred at work. Coworker gave me a hug and my damn shirt stunk the next day when I did laundry. 
* 75 emails in the hour and half drive from work. 

Edit 2: My ex was having a lot of affairs and lying. She would brag about manipulating me to friends, chats, and emails. Since we were open as a couple it was about honesty. In the end she could care less about me but if she could hold something over my head to manipulate then that is what she would do. She spent diaper and formula money once on beer and cigarettes and told me to figure it out when I was broke one week. 

She would project and twist to her advantage. She would even leave our 4 year old at home alone and party when I was working out of town. I even had people stop by to check on my son - he was hiding in the closet. He is grown now and fine.


edit 3: Also I just wanted to tell a funny story. I don't need a pat on the back and I see now I should not have been honest about the divorce because of shit people. I had no reason to lie or improve the story. If I had cheated I would be proud and even more proud to shove into her face right then and there. At the time I was trying to get her help and get on track financially. My mother had just died and I lost our home.  My real fuckup in life was thinking she could be helped. I dont trust anymore. I have given up dating. Stupid fucking people. I cant even post images without being told I didnt take it or that its fake.

"TIFU - By accidently guillotining my dick


Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

First off, my dick is still intact. Thank GOD. Anyway, this happened about four hours ago. I was moving an old table to my in-laws’ house. We decided to give them our old farm-style dinner table. You know, the kind with a leaf in the middle (this is important). 

My wife and I loaded the table with chairs into my tow-behind trailer with no problem. I head on over there and as soon as I arrived my brother-in-law, who looks like a two-legged moose -- Fuck it, we’ll call him ‘Moose’ – is waiting outside their apartment. I roll up and get out. As I am undoing the tie downs I ask him to take all the chairs out and carry them inside. Meanwhile, I am sliding the table, which is top down, out of the trailer. 

Now here’s where I fucked up. As I am tilting the table sideways it’s starting to open where the leaf goes. I don’t really think anything of it. However, the moment I get it completely sideways in my outstretched arms it slams shut….right on my dick shaft. Unfortunately, Moose is inside and I am stuck --for a lack of a better word. To make matters worse, I can’t pull the table apart in this position and I can’t set it down without yanking my wang off. I am standing there is agonizing fucking pain, frozen, for what felt like an eternity. 

Finally, Moose comes out and sees me there holding the table. I am probably pale white by this point. The good thing is that he doesn’t know how long I have been holding the table so he thinks nothing’s wrong. I, somehow, muster the words “Please help” without sounding too obvious that my shaft is lodged. Well, Moose grabs one end of the table and by the grace of God that causes it to open up a little bit. Instinctually, I drop my end and go to the Tebow position. Now, I have too much pride to tell Moose what was wrong, so I told him I ‘pinched a nerve’, which in hindsight is technically true. Right?

Anyway, with Moose’s help we carry the table to the apartment. All the while I’m fighting back tears. As soon as we put the table in place I made up some bullshit excuse why I couldn’t hang around and hurried back to my truck. I sat there for a good five minutes crying and making sure I didn’t snip the damn thing off. The good thing is that now it is massively swollen 😊. The bad thing is that now it is massively swollen. FML.

TLDR: Tried to lift a dinner table sideways and guillotined my dick. 

Edit: typos.

UPDATE: I was fully clothed for those wondering. I had a loose pair of workout shorts on at the time. Also, I went to the urgent care first thing this morning and the doctor said I will live. Yeah, that was embarrassing trying to explain.

"TIFU by accidentally giving my mom a THC medical patch instead of a CBD medical patch.


So my mother uses CBD medical patches for her knees and back. She's had multiple surgeries. These patches help her more than the pain pills ever did to be honest. Anyways, we were at work, we own a business together. Her knees were hurting really bad and she had forgotten her pain pills; she doesn't like using the patch at work even though it doesn't get you high. I had remembered I had a patch in my car so I suggested she use it. But, I had also forgotten that this patch was a thc patch. I had purchased the wrong one about a week earlier. I went out and got it and immediately opened it; I didn't even look at the front of the package surprisingly. She put the patch on and about 30 min later she said she felt funny. She said she kept forgetting what she was doing. I looked at the package in the trash and finally found out about the patch. It was pretty funny in a way because she was making fun out of the situation instead of being mad or freaking out. But she did have to stay in the back office most of the day. 

TLDR: accidentally gave mom a thc patch instead of a cbd patch. Accidentally got mom high. "

"TIFU by thinking i'm more athletic than i am


About 4 years ago on the walk home from a drink fuelled evening with my then lady friend, i decided to try and show off by betting her she couldnt jump to touch a shop sign, and then demonstrating myself how it's done. Why I thought this was particuarly impressive, I really dont know.

Anywho, i succesfully touched the sign with the spring and grace of a basketball pro. Upon landing however, i felt my right foot give way and a sharp pain shoot up my leg.

So we hobbled back to my place and decided tomorrow's forecast was a trip to the hospital for an xray.

Funnily enough, after waiting for 6 hours, the doctors declared they couldnt see anything wrong with my foot and sent me hopping away, crutchless.

It wasnt untill 5 days later i got a call from a sheepish sounding receptionist who asked me very nicely to make my way back to the hospital for a CT scan, as the wise doctors had reviewed my xray and thought they had spotted a fracture.

It transpired that i cracked my heel and was given a moon boot, crutches and 4 weeks off my feet (no bar work, hurrah!).

Lesson learnt: know when youre not Michael Jordan.

TL;DR drunkenly jumped to touch a sign, showing off to my lady friend, cracked my heel.

"TIFU by almost gluing my teeth together


This happened yday actually. I decided to get away the big city and rent a remote shepherd's hut in the beautiful British countryside. This place is in the middle of grass land and houses can be seen in the distance...perfect. When I unpacked I realised I left my toothpaste behind so I drove 4 miles to the nearest shop to get some much needed beer and of course toothpaste. I picked up the first box I saw that looked like toothpaste got in my car and 4 miles later I am in remote paradise. After I had some food and a fair amount of alcohol I decided to sleep so went to brush my teeth. As I squeezed the paste on my brush I saw it had a funny texture but who cares now..I started brushing my teeth when instantly I realised something is wrong. It was sticky and funny tasting. I am like wtf and check the tube where I see ""Denture adhesive cream. Strong hold"". I went from 0 to 100 in miliseconds started yelling wtf wtf wtf. Thinking what do I do now? Strong hold? How fast is it??? If I glue my mouth together how am i going to call anyone? I will sound like DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street where he took those old ludes (for anyone not seen that bit it's hilarious). So in a moment of clarity I start frantically stuffing toilet paper in my mouth trying to scrape it off which helped a bit but I could see in the mirror the layer of denture adhesive all over my healthy teeth like plaster on a wall. Finally I managed to get all the adhesive of my brush and started brushing like a maniac with water to get that shit off my mouth. I must have brushed for 20 minutes when it finally came off. 

TL;DR I bought denture adhesive instead of toothpaste almost glued my teeth together."
"TIFU by trying to be funny and possibly ruined my life


So this happened approx. 3 weeks ago. 

To set the scene, I live in Canada, I am 18 years old, senior year of high school, Just about every single person knows me in the school, and have racked up a hefty amount of scholarships, bursaries and grants towards my chosen university. 

The end of the school year is coming to an end, and the senior film class is trying to get student actors to film and produce their final project. To get actors, many of them have posted their requests on our Grad class (approx. 200 people) Facebook page in a very generic structure : ""Looking for actors to film **** type of movie for film class, need X amount of people for X amount of time."" Me, trying to be edgy and funny, parodied those posts by using the same generic structure and made it seem like a documentary that needs cameramen, and if you don't volunteer as a cameramen, don't come to school tomorrow. Giving it the slight ""school shooter"" edge. The first three comments were people that understood the dry humor in it, and volunteered to it. Immediately afterwards I had to leave to start my first day at a new job.

Fast forward to approximately 11 PM, I return home from work exhausted, and I notice two police cars in my driveway, I park my car and walk towards my parents who are standing at the door crying, and I try to find out what's happening as the officers close in on me from behind. They walk me inside and tell me I'm under arrest for ""Uttering Threats"" and begin reading me my Miranda rights as both my parents sob. I am put in cuffs and am then lead to a cell and held there for a day. Though the short time I spent in jail, it honestly allowed me to understand how much it fucking sucks. You lose concept of time as there is nothing to do, nothing to track time by, and you're constantly shivering from the cold. 

The next day I was interrogated by cops, which I tried to explain everything, and that though I understand the fear it could have affected on someone, it was nothing more than a terribly executed joke. Fast forward time ( I am still unaware of what time it is at any given point) I get taken to the courthouse where my lawyer speaks on my behalf to the crown counsel and sets me free on bail, since I am not a danger to society. (lol?) Though the RCMP has recommended charges against me, and the crown counsel approved. Finally I am released, and taken home by my parents, where I learn that I was expelled from my school, where I was graduating at the top of my classes, and have lost a very large amount of money in scholarships, grants, and bursaries.

I am currently struggling to successfully graduate from high school on time, so far have lost 3,000$ on lawyer bills, and still haven't finished. And have a chance of having a criminal record that will stick with me for the rest of my life.

TL;DR : Tried to be edgy by parodying posts by my graduation class on Facebook graduation page, got arrested and charged, lost lots of money on lawyer bills, and even more on scholarships. Have a chance to fail to graduate meaning I forfeit my University acceptance. Have a chance at having a criminal record stick on me.

Edit : woah I didn't expect this to actually get any attention, honestly kinda wrote this for the sake of relief. though many people are trying to support me, it doesn't help to combat the shitty feeling I have constantly. And I was one of the most uplifting person in school. 

If you have any questions on this situation ask away I'll try to answer or shed more light"
