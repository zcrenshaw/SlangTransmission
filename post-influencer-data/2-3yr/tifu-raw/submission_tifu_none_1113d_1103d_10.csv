"TIFU by brake-tapping a cop


so this happened about 45 minutes ago while i was driving home from work. Im going down a rural road at about 85km/h (speed limit is 80). When this guy in a blue ford focus comes flying up behind me and instead of passing he rides my tail so close that if i stopped for any reason he would have smashed into me. So me being me, i give a polite brake tap (not actually slowing down, just a warning not to follow so close). 

Turns out it's an undercover cop with a dashboard light strip (which isn't visible unless turned on) and he immediately pulls me over then screams at me for driving too slow and break tapping. I argue i was driving the speed limit and i didn't actually slow down when i tapped my brakes. 

256$ ticket for ""careless driving"" ...so i guess i fucked up by dealing with a cop on his bad day.

Holy guacamole, i cant beleive this went crazy over night...thanks everyone, i think ill try to fight this ticket!"
"TIFU by not proposing to my girlfriend.


Last week my girlfriend and I went on vacation in Stowe, Vermont. We decided to go for a walk. As we were walking, we came across [this large open field with a stage in the middle of it.](http://i.imgur.com/MXfgsn5.jpg)

ME: Oh they must have weddings here. This is really neat!

***She points to a bunch of flower petals on the ground*** 

HER: Oh yeah! Cool!

***I start humming that classic wedding tune as we walk hand in hand down the field*** 

ME: da-da-DA-DA da-da-DUH-DA!

***We finally get to the stage, which is empty aside from two chairs and a small box.***

ME: Woah, a ring box! Someone must have left it here.

***I bend down to pick up the box. My girlfriend stands in COMPLETE SILENCE looking shocked. On one knee, with a ring box in my hand, I open the box facing my girlfriend to reveal-- an empty ring box***

ME: See? Huh, too bad it's empty! Still pretty neat though.

HER: ...

***I suddenly realize everything I just did and what it must have looked like*** 

ME: Oh....Oh...Shit. Sorry.

HER: I hate you.

Oops. I ended up keeping the ring box though...it was pretty neat.

-------------------------

**EDIT:** To make matters worse, this is literally the fourth time something like this has happened.

**Time #1:** Last Christmas I made her a DIY kit and individually wrapped all of the parts (yarn, glue, stamps, glitter, cards, etc...). I wanted her to open up the smaller gifts first because I was really excited about some of the big stuff. She asked me what she should open first, so I grabbed the smallest box I could find (it was just a rubber stamp...the size of a ring box) and jokingly said something like ""I know it's what you've always wanted""...Oops.

**Time #2:** Our friend had just returned from the International Space University in France (it's a real thing). He graduated at the top of his class and they gave him a medallion in a jewelry box. I called my girlfriend into the room with the box closed and said something stupid and yeah...Oops.

**Time #3:** My girlfriend started an etsy shop so I had a custom stamp made of her logo. I was excited to surprise her with it and ended up texting her the day it came in: ""I have a big surprise for you when you get home!"". When she finally got home I told her to close her eyes and put out her hand...Oops.

-------------------------

***TL;DR:*** The Universe game me the perfect proposal and I shit all over it.


-------------------------

**EDIT #2:** Woah-- She isn't going to leave me...she knows how much karma I bring to the table. No way she's gonna' let ***this*** go.

**EDIT #3:** [She left me.](http://i.imgur.com/dS9Utgw.png)

**EDIT #4:** loljk. Her seeing [stuff like this](http://i.imgur.com/JMtYVgx.png) has warmed her numb little heart more than breaking up with me ever would.

**EDIT #5:** ITT -- People who have never dated a rational human being with a good sense of humor.

**EDIT #6:** We are engaged

**EDIT #7:** Oh, sorry. I accidentally hit **save** too soon. What I meant to say was *""we are engaged in debate over which of the four fuck ups was the worst.""*...Oops."
"TIFU by blowing a burp in my dogs face.


This Happened a few days ago. My dog, pouncer, is a half shih tzu, half poodle. Both breeds aren't that bright, old pouncer was left with a double dose of the stupid. I love him nonetheless, he's all i have. Every day i come home from work he's elated to see me. He's always been nervous and has some attachment issues.

After eating dinner i wind down on the couch, iron chef is on. Not the good one, the american one. It'll do. I lie down, pouncer lies on my chest, head near mine, all is good.

With out notice, the ghosts of my dinner come up to haunt me. Really it's my own fault, i shouldn't have thought nandos was an adequate meal substitution. No one should have to think that. I exorcise the faux-Portuguese demons from my mouth directly into poor pouncers face. I swear i didn't mean to. Pouncer perks, looking puzzled. He snouts out air a few times then freezes. Now he's looking at me and i'm looking at him.

I don't think i need to explain what happened... But i'll do it anyway. He threw up into my face. Not on, not around, into. The vomit traveled up my nose so far, i swear i could taste it. Within milliseconds i start to throw up. Whilst gasping for air, spicy nandos vomit is traveling back down into my lungs, scarring my insides. I run to the bathroom, strip down and have the most uncomfortable shower of my life.

As i leave the bathroom to go clean the ungodly mess left in my house, i find pouncer is happily cleaning it up for me.

He's all i fucking have.

**TD;LR:** blew burp in dogs face, dog threw up in mine, i threw up in his but he was ok with that.

EDIT: ok ok poodles are a smart breed. Obviously pouncer didn't inherit any smarts from that side.

**EDIT:** front page. This isn't my finest moment, but i guess it'll do. I'd like to thank all those who made this possible. Nandos, pouncer, especially pouncer but mostly nandos. Thanks.

EDIT: for the love of god i know poodles are a smart breed now. Mines just got a real bad case of the dumb-shits. I guess he inherited it from his own

EDIT: thank you for the gold! If i had only known cross-species, two-way vomiting was the secret to gilding, i would have tried it sooner."
"TIFU by exposing myself to my professor and my classmates


Never posted here before but I seriously fucked up this time. I walk around naked at home because its hot as hell and I live alone but my apartment is recommended by my university so a lot of schoolmates and teachers also live in the building. Well today I saw the biggest cockroach ever on the wall of my room. In my panic, I tried to shoo it out of my room by opening the door and sweeping it out with my shoe. As I did that, I realized my fuck-up as I saw my professor and some female classmates walking past my room. I realized my stupidity instantly and slammed the door shut. All they saw was me open the door naked and panicked, holding a shoe, and then instantly slamming the door shut. Yea, I'm an idiot.  
  
Worst part was the cockroach flew around my house and hid and now I can't find the fucker.  
  
Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. I wish reddit was bigger where I live right now so they could see some explanation and I don't look like such a pervert wierdo.  
  
Edit 2: I am a man and I live in the Philippines hence the flying cockroach / reddit not being popular / teachers and students living together."
"TIFU by telling my brother to pick a pimple &amp; sending him to the hospital [NSFW]


So, this didn't happen today, it all began on September 7. TL;DR at bottom.

As backstory, my younger brother just went away to his freshman year at college. He goes to school 6 hours away from home.

So - my brother texts me telling me he has a big pimple on the outside of his thigh. It hurts really bad, it's swollen and red, etc. I, being the disgusting person I am, request to see it, and tell him to pick it. So he sends me a picture - it's red and swollen, looks kind of like a bite, has a dark spot in the middle. The next day, Thursday, he FaceTimes me while he picks. It's really gross, he lances it with a needle and it's just bleeding and being generally disgusting. Later he said he took a long shower and squeezed stuff out. Ok, we're done here. Or so we thought...

The next day, Friday, he wakes up and it's huge. It's incredibly swollen, it's red, painful, he limps when he walks. He sends me a picture and I'm like wow - maybe you should go to the infirmary. He goes that afternoon, and the doctor immediately freaks out. Turns out, he had a boil. Boil got infected. He, by lancing and squeezing it, thrust the infection into his leg. Entire thigh is infected, as are his lymph nodes. He has cellulitis. Begins an antibiotic regimen (6 pills a day) and advil &amp; tylenol. She marks it up and tells him if it grows 2cm more, go to the ER. Okay, this sucks and I feel terrible because I told him to pick it, I told him to lance it! 

Saturday night he sends me a picture of it. It's huge, swollen, yellow pus - really fucked up. We determine he should go to the ER. Is immediately admitted. Begins getting IV antibiotics and painkillers. Testing for MRSA, monitoring him for septic shock. He's pretty fucked up.

Sunday he has bedside surgery to cut everything in his leg out. They tell him if it gets too bad, they'll move him to the OR and put him out. Ok, this sucks big time, holy shit. Only problem is that the local anesthetic reacts poorly with the pH of the pus, so it renders it basically ineffective. The surgeon cuts out a ton of dead flesh &amp; a pus pocket, which my brother said felt like 15 knives in his leg. Wow - I may be the worst sister in the world.

Anyway - surgery goes okay, he looks like he has a bullet wound in his leg. Test for MRSA comes back positive. They monitor him for another day and a half and he's finally released on Tuesday afternoon. He has to dress his wound every day and keep it clean (and it really is gross). He's on tons of pills still but he will live!

So, all in all, I'm the worst sister in the world and he will definitely never take advice from me ever again. I do have pictures if anyone is gross and wants to see (or is just really curious)!

EDIT: [photos with dates](https://imgur.com/a/98yUk)

EDIT 2: [more recent photos](https://imgur.com/a/lw4qq)

**TL;DR**: My brother had what looked like a big pimple. I told him to lance it and pick it. Turns out it was an infected boil. Entire thigh got infected, had to get admitted to the hospital and have surgery. Oops.

"TIFU by getting drunk the day my grandmother died


So, this didn't happen today. It actually happened March 27, 2009 on the day that my grandmother passed away. My grandmother, 81, had been in declining health for the last 4 years or so, mostly from her developing emphysema. I remember her having to do these breathing treatments multiple times a days and it really sucked knowing she never smoked and still developed it. That being said, she was a wonderful woman who made amazing whiskey cakes and ended up passing away at the age of 81. 
I was 17 (obviously not old enough to drink at the time) and I received the phone call after school that my grandmother was not going to make it through the day. I hauled out to her house to find that about 20 family members and friends were there along with hospice. I was the last person to arrive. They ushered me inside and brought me into her bedroom where she was laying in her bed. I was told she was no longer able to move or speak and all she could do was listen. I held her hand and all I could do was tell her that I loved her. I stepped out and shortly after she passed. Everyone was on the porch crying and I remember thinking how weird it was that I couldn't cry like everyone else.


This is where the fuck up happens. About an hour after she is taken away from the house and most people have gotten their crying out, everyone leaves except my uncle and I. My uncle, who has also passed since this, grabbed the last two beers out of her fridge and shared one with me while we talked about my grandma. Those two beers passed rather quickly and we both wanted to continue to drown our sorrows. Well, my grandmother used to make these ""whiskey cakes"" (I suppose they are the equivalent of a rum cake but with whiskey) that were fantastic. She would use a little bit of whiskey in her icing mixture and it would really set it off. I happened to be around for the last whiskey cake that she made and I knew where she hid her fifth of Johnny Walker Red. I dug out the bottle from under her kitchen sink, hidden way in the back behind cleaning supplies. My uncle and I continued to sip on it and share stories for about two hours until I ended up black out drunk. I don't even remember getting up out of the chair on the porch but apparently I told him that I had to piss and went inside to the bathroom. When I got in there, I guess I decided I had to shit so I dropped my pants and sat down. Now, what I'd like to say happened was that I slipped when i went to sit down on the toilet, hit my head on the tub and knocked myself out. Realistically, what probably happened was that I passed out while trying to poop and just fell forward onto the floor. Either way, there I was: passed out on the bathroom floor, pants around my ankles, and I ended up shitting all over myself. 
I was unconscious for a good while, at least an hour or so. My uncle had wandered over to my dad's house and I guess forgot about me. By the time they realized where I was and had gotten the bathroom door pried open I had rolled over and smeared shit all over the bathroom floor, gotten it on my hands, on the bathroom wall, and in my hair. They woke me up and got me into the shower. I remember being so confused (this was my first time ever being black out drunk) and wondering what was going on. My dad swears I started yelling that SOMEONE had shit my pants and I was trying to not admit that it was me. Anyways, I got cleaned up, went to bed, and woke up the next morning praying that it was all a dream. It was not. They still give me hell about that. In fact, that story was publicly told at my wedding two years ago. At this point it doesn't even bother me anymore; I wear it like a badge of merit (The story that is, not the shit.)


Tl;dr: Got blackout drunk at my grandmother's house after she died, passed out in the bathroom, and shit all over myself.


***
Edit: RIP inbox (and Maw Maw). Thanks for the enthusiasm guys! Glad I could make everyone chuckle at my shitty time. Since this one did so well, I actually have one other shitty story that I think I'll do next weekend. If you read that one too, you'll see that there seems to be a theme between alcohol and my defecation. On a completely unrelated note, the wife does not approve of me drinking as much anymore.


Edit 2: Holy shit my first gold! Thanks so much u/2faymus


Edit 3: For everyone who has asked, I will get the recipe for her whiskey cakes from my stepmother and post it on here. I should be able to get it within the next few days and get it up before the week is out.


Edit 4: HOLY SHIT I MADE THE FRONT PAGE!


***
Edit 5: Here is the recipe. I only ask that when someone makes it that they take pictures, post it in r/food, and drop my username so I don't miss it. 

The whiskey Cake Recipe:


1 box yellow cake mix (without pudding)

1 box instant vanilla pudding

4 eggs

1/2 cup oil

1 cup milk

1 shot whiskey (1 and 1/12 ounces)

1 cup walnuts


Combine all ingredients. Mix for 3 minutes. Pour into a well-greased tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-60 minutes.


Topping:

1 stick butter

1 cup sugar

1/2 cup whiskey


Melt butter. Add sugar and whiskey. Cook until sugar is dissolved and of syrup texture. After removing the cake from the oven poke holes (with fork) in the top (leave cake in pan while doing this). Pour some of the syrup mixture over the cake. Let cake sit in pan 15-20 minutes. Remove cake from pan and brush remaining syrup on sides and on top of cake."
"TIFU by pranking a narcoleptic


Ok, TIFU I guess. Or 18 years ago I fucked up. 

Growing up we had a friend we called Bert. He was a big lanky and skinny dude, pale as a ghost due to his low blood pressure, prone to bouts of narcolepsy. Bert wasn't his real name, just a nickname that had stuck--it was short for Sherbet (pronounced Sher*bert* here), because he would foam at the mouth during his narcoleptic spells. In other words, he was a fantastic source of entertainment for our idiot troupe, and pranking Bert became part of our weekend routine.

He would drift to sleep during the slightest lull in action--sitting still more than ten minutes, basically. The only way he could stay awake was by keeping occupied, so he would walk around a lot, or keep himself busy eating (jerky was his favorite). When he slept he had two modes: he would either nod off and jerk back into consciousness a split second later (no good for pranking), or he would be out cold for maybe five minutes (perfect for pranking). You could tell he was out cold when he drooled.

One day we're playing Fifa '97 at another friend's house. I don't know if you remember Fifa '97 for the PS1 but the loading times were atrocious. After a while we looked over and Bert was slumped into himself, drool pooling in the folds of his coat (he rarely removed his big Manchester United manager's coat). We all agreed that Bert was due a pranking.

We knew we could move Bert around while he slept--an arm here, a leg there. But we'd never fully tested the limits of his tolerance. Two of us took an arm each and another guy took his legs and we lifted him from his chair. Sure enough he remained asleep. We swung him back and forth a bit and still he slumbered. We were amazed.

So *of course* we knew the thing to do would be to carry him upstairs to our friend's sister's bedroom. At first we just wanted him to wake up somewhere weird. Then *we* got weird. Our friend's sister was about four years older than us, something of a hottie, and she worked odd shifts at the local supermarket. We'll call her Jane for the purposes of this retelling, it's close enough. It was mid-evening and we didn't know when exactly Jane would be home, which lent a frisson of terror to the process of undressing Bert.

After we'd stripped him down to his underwear, we slipped him under Jane's big baby-pink quilt and took his clothes downstairs. This should have been enough for us, but the madness had taken us and we knew we were going to push it as far as we could. We took one of Jane's fragrant girly pillows and put a bra and a pair of panties on it, then slipped it under Bert's naked arm.

We skulked back downstairs stifling laughter, waiting for Bert to wake and flee from the room in terror. Five minutes passed, then ten. Usually he would be awake by then. Maybe the comfort of the bed had lulled him into a deeper sleep...

We went up to check on him, and found him in much the same position as we had left him, except now he had an obvious erection that had escaped from the front of his boxers and he had just had a very messy wet dream all over Jane's sheets and pillow. It had darkened an expanding area of the crotch of her panties.

One of the most grim experiences of my life was trying to mop up Bert's cum with a bundle of kitchen paper on the end of a pair of barbecue tongs. We tried to wake him but it was no good, and that awful pale thing of his refused to deflate. Apparently he had no blood pressure problems in *one specific area.* Then we hear keys in the front door and *holy shit Jane is home.*

I'm ashamed to say that I thundered down the stairs and ran out the back door and vaulted over the fence with an athleticism I never knew I had, closely followed by friend number 4, leaving our other friend to deal with Bert, his sister, the panties, and the cummy tongs.

That was a shitshow.

**Edit**: some folk are asking for what happened afterwards, so here's a summary: we ran for a bit then slipped home without passing his street. There was much nervous laughter. We didn't hear about our 'house ban' until two days later when we next saw our friend face to face. He explained that Bert woke in a fugue state just as Jane came upstairs...for a while he had no idea where he was, or why he was sticky, and he reacted to the pillow like it was a severed horse head. 

Jane naturally lost her mind at the state of her room and the cumstained slenderman flailing around in it and it apparently took about an hour to explain the sequence of events to her (my friend said it was all down to me and friend #4, a survival strategy I completely understood). Meanwhile Bert got dressed and got out of there, pleading complete ignorance. When my friend's mother came home, Jane spilled everything to her and Mrs X just blanket-banned us from the house forever. Luckily she was too tired and exasperated to call our parents because I'd still be locked in my room now.

Our friend had to clean everything up, naturally.

When we regrouped Bert was downtrodden and said we'd gone too far, but we soon got him laughing and back on form when we complimented the ridiculous volume of spackle he'd produced, joked that it wasn't the first stranger's load dumped on those sheets, etc etc etc. Juvenile stuff.

**tl;dr**: a narcoleptic friend; a dick that would not bend; a spill we tried to mend; a house ban without end

"TIFU By Putting The Wrong CD In The Player For The Prom Processional


So, in true /r/TIFU fashion, this didn't happen today but instead some years back. 

Join me now in a time of wonder during the long fabled year of 2004. I was working my way through college by being a mobile DJ on weekends and I had been assigned a "" Special Ed Prom"". 

As you can expect this was an end of the year dance for a special needs school that wanted the kids to have that iconic prom moment like all the other kids. 

Well, I started as I normally did making an introduction and explaining the events of the evening. The people who organized the dance wanted a powerful opening that the kids would recognize. 

As luck would have it, the Black Eyed Peas had been recently riding the wave of their classic ""Let's Get It Started"" and I figured that would be my best bet. I cued the CD up and began my intro.

This is where the fuck up went downs....

With most censorship, words get bleeped out. However, on rare occasions, the artist will change entire words. This was the latter.

Instead of playing my radio friendly version of ""Let's Get It Started"" I instead put in the OG album and played the songs uncensored version ""Let's Get Retarded""

I was utterly shocked and it all went to hell after that. I was able to recover and save the show but I am not surprised that I want offered the contract the next year.... Or the year after that....

TL;DR : Played the wrong version of a popular song that directly mocked my clients disability. 

Post Script: The local news station was covering the dance and my fuck up was caught on camera and broadcast.

Edit: Thanks for the gold anonymous stranger. You have busted my gilded cherry

Edit #2: I feel I should explain the ""local news station""  bit. They were covering the dance being held as a warm fuzzies puff piece and *supposedly* you can hear my fuck up but I never confirmed as I have not ever seen the video myself. I just know I saw the crew there. Furthermore, I doubt they would let the word ""retarded"" hit the air waves.

 I know it sounds it sounds fishy as fuck but I make no secret of the fact that I have no digital proof of this timely shenanigan. "
"TIFU by screaming ""Vagina!"" to a 10th grade English class.


So, I am 23 and a new English teacher. I look like a kid myself, and I'm barely 5'1"" so I always try my best to be professional. I want my students to take me seriously. I don't think they will after today.

I was reading an Emily Dickinson poem to my class of 10th graders, and I got to the line that says ""Shuts the door--to her divine majority,"" and I got tongue-tied in the worst way. Here's where my students lose all respect for me.

Very loudly I said, ""Shuts the door to her VAGINE-"" and cut to students falling out of their chairs howling with laughter at me. I just sat down. I gave up. I literally have no idea how I replaced ""divine"" with ""vagine.""  How?! It will haunt me forever.

Perhaps the worst part? I sent a kid to the principal two days ago for screaming ""Penis!"" while going over answers in class. On his way out today he high-fived me and said, ""Mad respect.""

EDIT: Aw, snap! Front page! So far, none of my students have called me out for posting this.

Also, some people are super upset that I sent Penis Kid to the principal. Trust me, I am a pretty chill person, but some kids (especially huge teenaged boys) like to test the limits of the teacher who looks like a seventeen-year-old girl. It was mostly a warning shot because he had been causing some major issues. He got a slap on the wrist and has been an angel to me since then. ;)"
"TIFU by farting in the shower with my SO.


Literally happened like 5 minutes ago. So the other day, my SO and I were browsing an ask Reddit thread about how to strengthen your relationship. We came across something about getting in the shower together, lathering up each other's butts and just rubbing booties together, ya know, really exciting stuff. So we waited until this weekend when I could be over at her place to test this out. After a long, hot day outside, we figured today would be our opportunity. We got into our birthday suits as fast as we could and hopped in the shower. Things were going good! We got all soapy, pressed our butts together, and shook like our lives depended on it. It was super fun. Here's where I fucked up; for some reason, I thought it would be a wonderful idea to just let out one of the burliest biker farts my body could produce. I built up my energy and just exploded flatulence. Of course we both thought it was hilarious and began to laugh... Until the smell hit her nose. She looked dead into my eyes, almost as if she were about to tell me the saddest news in the world, and threw up everywhere. All in the shower floor and on our feet was my girlfriend's vomit. Now here I am, cleaning the shower while my girlfriend feels ashamed and embarrassed over what just happened. FML

Edit: Wow! That blew up! Thank you guys so much. My girlfriend and I have a really silly and fun filled relationship and we've been together for almost a year. I love her so much. Thank you guys for the funny comments! 

Again, for those of you who didn't see, here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4y0kuj/couples_of_reddit_what_are_fun_things_you_should/d6k8x20

"TIFU by making myself look like a pedophile


Happened last year, not today. But anyway, me [22M] and my family (dad, step mum, two younger brothers 10 &amp; 5), we're on holiday. Nowhere special, we live in the UK and decided to holiday within the country as money was tight. We went to this resort, it's in the middle of the countryside, a big private fenced off piece of land. On the land is loads of these wooden lodges that people stay in, it's more of a quiet getaway. But on the resort there's a main building with a games center and entertainment such as disco nights and whatever. Really cheesy stuff but I wasn't bothered as my brothers loved it. Anyway, next to this main building there's a huge shop that sells souvenirs and all kinds of home accessories, it's only 1 floor but there's about 40 aisles. We go in there on the last day to buy some things to take back home, Mum &amp; Dad are leading the way, brothers closely behind. And I'm just holding back on my phone chatting to friends so I didn't die of boredom. Not really paying much attention to what's going on. Big mistake.

I glance up from my phone and I see mum and dad are now pretty far away. There's a short aisle that I can see over so If i went straight and then left I would've caught up with them. I assumed my brothers were with them but obviously they were too short to see. That's what I thought until I saw my youngest brother on his own looking at things on the shelf in front of me. I don't bother him, I decide to let him explore and do his thing while i hang back. A short while goes by and I figure it's time to catch up with the rest of the family. So I grab his hand and say ""Let's go!"" and start walking in the direction in which I last saw my family going. We're about half way up this long aisle when my brother starts making this crying noise. It was weird because it didn't sound like my brother at all. I looked down and staring up at me was this completely random kid crying, looking scared shitless, and wearing the exact same coat as my brother. I froze, not really knowing what to do or how the fuck I managed to mistake someone else's kid for my own brother. 

Before I could even react I heard a very loud, very intimidating ""Oi! what the fuck d'ya think you're doing!?"" I looked up, and at the end of the aisle is a ripped, bald, tattoo covered, white vest wearing bear of a man looking angrier than I've ever seen anyone in my entire life. That must be the dad I thought. Behind was a sobbing panic stricken woman who I assumed was the mother. I tried to think of how I would explain this to them both but before I could think of anything he started charging at me. This 6'5 built like a brick shit house daddy bear was fucking charging at me! Without any hesitation I did the only thing I could do, and ran. I ran for my fucking life. Straight out of the shop, straight out of the main plaza area, and right back to my lodge where I remained hiding until my dad called me. ""You alright? Where did you go?"" He said. ""Dunno what's happened but it's all kicking off in here, police are here and everything. Some sick cunt tried to snatch a kid"". I told him I started to feel unwell and decided to go home to have a lay down. ""Ok"" He said. ""Be careful"". 

To this day I haven't told any of them because I don't know how they'd react, and if the family of the boy are reading this, I really am sorry, I'm not a nonce, it was a genuine mistake.

TL;DR Accidentally stole a kid, got chased by dad of said, ran for my life back to my lodge while police we're called. (Without the kid of course)

Edit: Changed the TL;DR so it doesn't look like I took the kid to the lodge with me. A lot of confusion there. Apologies I'm not used to writing posts like this.

Woke up this morning and my inbox has blown up, I can't reply to everything so I'm going to answer a few questions here.

Yes, I shouldn't have ran. But it's not everyday you're in a situation like this, I panicked and mad a bad decision, which was to run. As I was back in the lodge I considered finding my family and explaining to them what had happened before going to the police, but the fact is I already ran, so that made things a lot worse. It was a fuck up within a fuck up so to speak.

No it wasn't centreparks, although that comment almost made me spit my tea all over my desk. It was in Hastings, but unfortunately I don't know the name of the place. A lot of woodland around, very secluded place. I'm hoping someone knows it and provides a name?

Yes I can see now that the title doesn't really match the story, but it's well over 3500 likes so I'm not gonna change it now.

I'm glad everyone got a laugh out of this, looking back it is pretty funny. I only wished I had handled things differently. I can honestly say I've never been so scared in my entire life. The man was the true definition of an English ""geezer"". I on the other hand am pretty weedy, but very fast and agile. I did what I'm best at, ran away from my problems. Pretty much a metaphor for my life.

Edit: Spelling."

"TIFU writing a poem for second grade English...


I grew up in a very religious house hold.  I went to a private church school in Iowa and to church every Wednesday and Sunday.  Not only was our school a christian school but it was also located in a church, go figure.  

My older brother had created a music group that played worship songs called SSW, secret society of wretchedness.  He drew a picture of a smiling clown on his guitar and I loved it.  I would always tell him to play guitar for me.  

A few days prior to this fuck up, I had heard that another name for a church was a steeple.  With that in mind, we began learning rhyming schemes in English class.  The teacher asked us to write a poem from 4 different schemes and to draw pictures for each line.  

I wanted to write a poem about the clown some how.  So I put down my first line, then drew a picture of a clown.  The second line was the same picture, only him frowning.  The next line was a car, then a church, then the clown behind bars with tears coming down his face.  So the poem was this:

There once was a plumb mad clown
Who wore on his face a frown
He went to a steeple
Killed lots of people
Until the cops came and beat him down.

Not only do I remember the look on the teachers face, how hard she was gripping my hand as she dragged me to the principals office, the look on the principals face as he mashed the phone's key pad to call both my parents from work, but I remember other people I didn't know showing up to talk to my parents.  They were convinced I was the devil and, this is true, prayed for me before we left school.

It was only a few weeks ago that my mother told me that the other people who showed up were CPS investigators which makes sense because they showed up at our house the next day and asked me all these dumb questions like if anyone was hurting me or what I thought of my parents.  

I still remember the car ride home. I asked if I was in trouble and my dad laughed and said no.  I said, ""What did I do?""

""You wrote a good poem.""  "
"TIFU and had to call the paramedics for my naked boyfriend


Actually, it was the other day - but, I had to wait until the weekend to share my story with all of you.
So, here it is again... Have you ever wanted to try something you saw on a porn? Well, I did. My BF and I are physically fit, and it didn't seem like that big of a deal.  Here's what happened...   
I've always thought it looked sexy for a guy to pick up a girl and hold her during sex. So, I wanted to try it too. After going strong for about 15 minutes, I asked my BF to pick me up, which he did.
But, I guess I didn't take a few things into account: 

1) how easily things pop out in that position (never happens in the movies);   

2) how worn out my BF already was;   

3) how far the nearest available wall space was from my bed;   

4) how slippery a sweaty body can actually be (even with fans).  

Because, as soon as he picked me up, I started slipping down his body. So, I tried to crawl back up his body, by gripping tighter around his neck and waist. He tried to waddle over to the wall for extra support, but I guess I had a death grip on him. After maybe two minutes of struggling, he started swaying side to side. Then, his eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out, with me still on top of him. I didn't know a full-body ""bear hug"" could do that.

He's fine now, but imagine trying to explain that one to the paramedics. If there's a next time, I think we'll just start against the wall. - Yeah, TIFU.   
&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR. caused my BF to pass out during sex, had to call ambulance

EDIT: Sorry about the formatting. It sucks.

"TIFU writing an essay


This actually happened when I was 8, but I was just reminded of it by another post on reddit. 

So there I was in history class and the teacher tells us to write an essay about a famous Viking. I chose 'Cnut the Great'. Despite producing what I considered to be some fine work, a spelling mistake was repeatedly made throughout, and I did not recieve my paper back after I handed it in. I remember the teacher treating me as though I knew what I'd done, and gave me a real verbal shit-kicking. I literally had no clue what the fuck was going on. It actually took me years to work out what had happened..."
