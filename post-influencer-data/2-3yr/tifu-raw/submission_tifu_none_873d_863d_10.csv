"TIFU by putting a dildo in my gun case (NSFW)


This happened a couple weeks ago...

My aunt and sister-in-law came to visit my neck of the woods, but I'd just returned from a business trip and hadn't been home yet when we met up. They wanted to see my new apartment, so we headed over to my place. I went back to my bedroom to change out of the airplane clothes (I can't be the only one who does this, right?), and notice I'd left a purple vibrator on my bedside table (my husband had jokingly purchased the brightest, most obnoxious purple vibrating eggplant he could find, because we're apart a lot for work and he laughs at my affinity for purple). I went to put it away just as my sister in law walked into my bedroom. Having family see you holding a vibrating jelly stick strikes me as odd, so I ducked down and went for the first concealing item I saw: my pistol case. I quickly and snugly tucked the vibrator in the foam-lined case alongside my pistol, stuffed it under the bed and went on my merry way. No harm, no foul, no weird looks at Thanksgiving.

A few days later, I'm headed to the gun range for some target shooting. I grabbed my guns, some ammo, and headed out. It was such a quick and seemingly insignificant moment with the vibrator, I'd forgotten about stuffing it into the pistol case (the gun is purple, too, btw). I arranged everything on the table, and opened my gun case. In what seemed like slow motion, I opened the gun case -- the dildo, uncomfortably stuffed alongside the pistol, rolls out of the case, perfectly bumps something (the table, I assume?), starts vibrating, and comes to a rest on the floor. Past the table. This means, ladies and gents, that it's past the area you can go; there is a purple vibrating dildo lying amongst the spent brass shells. While I was in my own lane, there were 15-20 people in the other lanes. For the briefest moment, recognition seemed to fill the area as the gun range fell silent... 15 people watching the hapless dildo vibrate and twist it's way across the shooting range. Fortunately, it was only a couple feet past the table, so I grabbed the broom intended for sweeping shells, pulled it back under the table, turned it off, and threw it away. Looks like I have to find a new range now...  

TL;DR - in trying to hide a dildo, I put it in a gun case and proceeded to spill it onto a public gun range. "

"TIFU by trying to save someone from being robbed.


Obligatory this did not happen today, but around nine month ago. On a weekend we had planned a night out with some friends. An old chap of mine who moved a year ago came over and needed a place to crash, so I invited him over to my place. 

Later that night we started drinking at home before moving over to a club which was about ten minutes by foot from my place. At the club I rapidly spend all of my cash on drinks. I asked the buddy who stayed with me to lend me some money so i could keep partying with them. He happily obliged and we partied until about 04.30 AM before making our way back home. Since he lend me around 50 bucks and was due to leave relatively early in the morning, I decided it would be the best thing to give back the money right away so i wouldn't forget it. So naturally, before going home we went to the next ATM where I wanted to grab enough cash to pay him back, but as we approached the ATM, two guys who were standing right in front of the ATM started to fight each other. 

In my drunk mind - I was ABSOLUTELY smashed, we had been drinking since eight hours - I was pretty sure that someone was being robbed when one of those two guys pinned down the other one to the ground. I turned to my buddy and told him to call the cops while I darted towards those two persons on the ground. I grabbed the one on top, who was holding the bottom guy in a joint lock, and pulled him off while telling him to stop and keep calm.

Now, this is were the Fuck-up happened. I was totally perplexed when all of a sudden the whole place was crowded with people rushing towards me. I was quickly brought to the ground and also pinned down with a joint lock. I shouted to my buddy to call the police asap, but he was too smashed to get his phone to work. 
So while Im lying on the ground shouting something like: ""Call the fucking Cops! Call the fucking Cops, shit's going down!"", the guy pinning me down leans in to my ear and whispers: ""We are the Cops."", all while handcuffing me.

It felt like it was straight out of a mobster movie.
Well, as it turns out, i did NOT observe a Robbery, but what actually went down was an undercover cop making an arrest. I totally busted that arrest and got a pretty bad scratch on my chin and nearly a dislocated shoulder from being tackled and held in that joint lock. Cops were pretty pissed too.

TL;DR: Wanted to save someone from being robbed. Busted an undercover arrest."
"TIFU by costing my business 15k and losing my dream job.


TIFU: So in honor of the norm of this sub this incident happened about a year ago.
I worked as a Travel Agent in rural Australia in a small office that was run by the largest Travel company in Aus.
I had a client come in one day one of my very first who wanted a basic travel package to Vanuatu, sure no problems easy enough I work it up for them take their money and send them on their way until their tickets are ready (about 4 months after the payment). Fast forward 6 months I get woken up at 3am from our customer relations team letting me know of my colossal fuck up. We had a system that let us know of all flight developments for the tickets purchased by our clients cancellations, time changes etc. Now I had next to no training on this system and thus very important message got overlooked by my rookie eyes. It turns out Virgin Australia had cancelled all flights to Vanuatu due to runway conditions about a week after I booked these flights. So my clients are at the airport at 3 in the morning being told that their flight DOES NOT EXIST. Long story short we paid for 2 first class tickets, 2 weeks of 5 star resort accommodation as well as food and drink expenses. Totalling $15,673AUD. And was promptly ""let go"". 
TLDR didnt know what I was doing customers tried to board a nonexistant flight and I cost the business 15K and lost my dream job"
"TIFU by not reading the sympathy card


So we have this thing at work, which I'm sure is common in many workplaces, where when a life event happens that warrants a department wide greeting card (retirement, birth of child, death of family member, etc) to be delivered to an individual the card is put in a manilla envelope with a list of all the employees in the department and a description of what the card is for.  The idea is to sign the card, cross your name off, and hand it to another person on the list whos name isn't yet crossed off.  

So a few minutes ago, a coworker pops in and hands me the envelop.  Me, being wrapped up in my work, opened the envelope and saw that it was a ""Sympathy"" card.  I quickly signed it with a cheap cookie-cutter response, ""Sorry for your loss ~ Breakfastbeerz"" crossed my name off, stuffed it in the envelope, and read who was next.  Fortunately, the walk wasn't far as my office neighbor's name was still available.  I popped my head in his office and told him, ""Here's another card to sign"", and walked out.

About 30 seconds later, my neighbor comes into my office holding the envelope, with a really sour look on his face, and drops it on my desk, ""I don't think you intended to give this to me"", he walked out.  I opened the card and finally got around to reading it.  Low and behold, the card was for him.  His mother had passed away a few days ago and I just gave him his own sympathy card and asked him to sign it.  I feel like such an ass.

TL;DR Quickly signed a sympathy card without reading it.  Gave it to a coworker to sign, it was a sympathy card for his own mother whom had just passed away."
"TIFU by leaving the bath tub water running and trying to run back to stop it from overflowing


Had mother's day celebration for my mom and wifes mom here at my house, to avoid having to do the drive of both houses as we typically do for every holiday. Last people to leave the house were saying their goodbyes so I turned on the bath tub to take my usual bath with my son. (toddler) Good bye's were drawn out and I forgot about bath tub, I heard a weird noise as if the washer and dryer was screwed or the hose or just something when I realized and remembered I left the water running in the bath tub...I ran (dummy) to turn off the bath tub, but the water had already made its way into the bedroom (tile) by the time I realized that there was water in the bedroom I was up in the air and landing on my head seeing the stars trying not to lose consciousness...worst part is that everybody was outside saying goodbyes so I had to drag myself halfway out the house until someone made their way back in because they left something. Iphone was in pocket...iphone 7 not as water resistant for sitting in 1 inch water for maybe 1 minute. Fortunately for me it was only 10 stitches and negative on the CT scan.

TL;DR slipped on wet floor, busted my head and got water damage to my iphone"
"TIFU By smoking two cigarettes in quick succession


So I started my new job as an aviation engine technician about two months ago, pretty stressful start to the job as I had a whirlwind induction to the world of engine repair. This stressful time made my cigarette intake span over the working day, whereas before I only smoked at home.

So fast forward to today, I got into work at 6AM, way before anybody else, as I had some things to do, and time dragged very slowly, it is usually a very interesting job, but today was clearly just a bad day! 

At 9.15 we have our first break of the day, and I went over to my toolbox, and rolled myself some cigarettes. Now usually I would only have one on my break, as it's only 15 minutes long and that's usually enough for me. Well today I thought it would be a great idea to smoke two cigarettes in quick succession as the morning had been very boring. 

I made my way over to the smoking hut, and sparked up my first cigarette, this was fine, and after I was feeling content. Then came the second cigarette. About half way through I felt a bit funny, but ignored the feeling and finished it. 

Now on the walk back to my working area, I was rounding the corner from the smoking hut and my vision went completely black, I tried to grasp onto something but fainted, and hit my head on the floor. Not sure how long had passed when I came too, could've been a couple of seconds, could've been a minute for all I know. The first thing I remember is a guy shouting and running over to see if I was alright (luckily this guy was our first aid employee!)

The rest of the story consists of being sick due to concussion, being fussed over by upper management about how an ambulance was needed to cover their insurance, and eventually being dropped off to the emergency department of the hospital in the company van!

I now have a golf ball sized lump on the back of my head and a pretty killer headache!

Tl:dr; Smoked two cigarettes in a row, got a major head rush, fainted and got concussion from hitting my head on the floor!

Edit: Grammar

Update: Wow this has blown up over night! Nice to see you all getting a kick over my misfortune ;) when there were less comments last night I could reply to them all, but that would take hours now so just thought I'd say here that yes I've decided to completely give up smoking cold turkey.

 I realised it could've been a lot worse if I'd fallen over a little bit to the left as there was a large steel pipe jutting out of the floor! I want to make sure that the situation doesn't happen again and the only way to do so is by quitting, so thanks for all of the motivational messages and methods, they've helped a lot!

Update 2: noticed a few people saying stuff like 'Yeah sure it's a normal cigarette' etc etc, I'm in my dream career, I'm in the best place to eventually become an aviation engineer. I'm not going to risk that by lighting up at work lmao. Plus I offered to do a drug test after, as the first aider did ask me whether I had smoked anything else, to which they declined and said they trusted me."

"TIFU by spilling gas on myself


Unlike many stories, this happened about 7 this morning, so, 4 hours ago. I'm sitting at home writing this.

I sell parts for a dealership that's part of a corporation owned by a few partners in the southeast United States. This morning my boss says a body shop is in a hurry and sends me on a delivery. Not normal, but he's one of my favorite customers I've known for awhile. So I go put gas in our van. Ford Transits are pieces of shit anyway, but you have to open the drivers door to get to the gas cap. Out of frustration, when the pump clicked off I jerked it out. Welllll, for the first time in my life I grabbed the handle, and gas covered my pants. Well they're dark dress pants, not like anyone will notice.

Fast forward a couple hours, im back at the shop and its a really strong smell. My boss pulls me in and says ""I hope that gas spill can go away quick, (one of the big guys) is here and wants to talk to you. We've already gone in its your turn.

There's alot of issues here and I might have another job, nothing I've done wrong, but that's unrelated.

So I go in and our controller (the lady who runs the office, is in charge when the general managers not there ) is here to. Partly because there's been descrepencies with commission.

So maybe 5 minutes in she starts coughing and quickly throws up. I guess I've been around cars all my life and been soaking in it all morning, I didn't realize how bad the smell was.

So the meeting promptly ended, I quickly explained the situation, was called a dipstick and told to go home and change. And to make sure not to use a company vehicle until then.

So I just drove my 28 year old truck that can't pass a gas station, 20 miles one way to go change. So I'm gonna sit here for a minute, drink a beer, write this out and come up with an apology.

Oh well, might have a job paying twice as much soon anyway

TL;DR spilled gas on my pants, was in a meeting with a really high up guy and a nice lady, nice lady threw up"
"TIFU: Mixing up two containers = $1,500 mistake


TLDR: I mixed up containers and sprayed round-up on 250,000 sqft of campus just in time for graduation.

So.... I am a full time teacher + part-time maintenance worker at a high school and part of my job is to take care of the area surrounding the gym and center campus before major events such as Graduation, Alumni Weekend, and the visitation weekend by prospective students. 

A few weeks ago I get the campus looking pretty awesome after planting a few hundred flowering plants, mulching everything, and pulling weeds until my fingers have a permanent green tint to them. After this I started to work on the center campus and parking lot grass which for some ungodly reason has been completely taken over by dandelions. I go to the store and pick up several large containers of bargain name round up and more containers of something to spray on the lawn and kill broad-leaf plants. So after teaching a full load of classes I got on the tractor, filled up the sprayer and sprayed for the next three to four hours every single square inch of the center campus and area around the main parking lot. I come back to fill up my final load and I'm out of the chemical mix, to late in the day to run to Home Depot to pick up more so I decide to edge the parking lot and cracks to kill the weeds. I reach under the work bench to get the other canister of 'round-up' and pull out instead a completely full container of Tri-mec lawn-safe broad leaf weed killer. Stomach sank to my feet as I realized that I had just sprayed the entire campus with round up. Every. Damn. Inch. All this is perfect timing because graduation will be the weekend that all the grass is supposed to be completely dead. 

Now im researching how to reseed 250,000 sqft of lawn and calculating how much I'll have to spend to get the grass looking nice by August. The seed alone is gonna cost $1,500 minimum.

Evidence of my stupidity and exhaustion
