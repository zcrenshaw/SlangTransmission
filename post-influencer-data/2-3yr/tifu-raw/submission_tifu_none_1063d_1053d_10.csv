"TIFU by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the Atlantic Ocean on an international flight.


I was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from Delhi to London, so I quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as I ran to the boarding gate.

About 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the TVs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

I can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

After a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

As it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. They're also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I'd grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

And **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.


**

TL;DR: I made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. Everyone lost their minds."
"TIFU by punching my boss


Our office is set up really strange and to get to the women's restroom you have to walk through a large dimly lit storage area and pass through a couple of doors. I had just finished washing my hands and turned to reach for the door to leave. Suddenly the door was flung open and scared the ever loving shit out of me. I guess my fight or flight chose fight because the next thing I know I'm wildly swinging a right hook. I punched my boss, who was dressed as a witch for Halloween, in the jaw/neck as we screamed at each other.

We've now had two ""safety meetings"" about preventing future incidents, they've made laminated signs and taped them to the bathroom door that say ""Please open SLOWLY"" and every woman in the office now announces themselves every time they come in or out of the office. I got a verbal warning from HR and I'm now too afraid to use the office restroom because I don't know if I can be trusted when startled. I sat through a meeting about it dressed as a bumble bee and trying to not laugh and cry at the same time.

Edit: I'm a female. Boss is female.

Edit Edit: Boss was also dressed like a witch for Halloween."
"TIFU by forgetting to poop.


So I work for a cable provider taking calls for tech support. During my day, I get two 15 minute breaks and a half hour break. This all started about 30 minutes ago, and is still a very active situation.

About 15 minutes before my break, I felt the feeling in the pit if my stomach that I needed to relieve my self. Looking at the time, I realized I was close enough to my break to not worry about it. 5 minutes later I began to worry, as the feeling turned from a tingle to slight pain. Looking back at the time, I was unsure if I would make it. Fast forward to the final 5 minutes before my break and I started to feel like I would barely make it. Standing seemed to help a lot for some reason, so I paced in front of my desk while finishing my last call. That actually made me feel much better and almost relieved the pain entirely. Once the call was over, I clocked out for my break and headed for the restroom.
This is where the fuckup really begins.

I walk into the restroom, pulled my pants down and my phone out, and sat down on the toilet. I began browsing reddit, minding the clock as to not be late from my break. Reading through some TIFU posts and laughing at some of you idiots always helps me pass the time. After a few minutes I realized I should head back. I pulled up my pants and walked back to my desk. I only made it about 45 seconds into my first call after the break before that all too familiar pain returned. Thats when it hit me. I forgot to poop. I am currently pacing in front of my desk,  sweat forming at the top of my head, clenching my cheeks as I am typing this on my phone, waiting for my customers equipment to reset. The countdown begins.

TL:DR: had to poop really bad while at work, went to restroom and forgot to poop, now I may shit my pants.

Edit:Update: After what was almost an hour long call, I put my phone in ""personal"" time and ran to the bathroom, barely made it to the seat, and had a glorious bowel evacuation. Thank you all for reading and laughing at my situation. :)

Edit: the letter A

Edit: GOLD? Who knew forgetting to poop would create reddit gold! Thanks stranger! "
"TIFU by getting my co worker fired


This happened last week.
I work at a Mazda dealership, which is quite slow during the week. I went out to the store to get lunch and when I came back my friend/ co worker wasn't there, so I figured he was out back behind the store smoking the blunt he told me about earlier. Well, I didn't know he was actually test driving with customers.  One of the features these new Mazdas do is read your text messages out loud, so he had paired his phone to show the customer how it worked. 
He didn't expect me to text him ""Yo you smokin the blunt out back?""....
Well the customers immediately told my manager, who decided not to fire both of us, just my friend. He decided to punish me internally. I feel really bad, this guy trained me and I feel like a shittard"
"TIFU by trying to translate the entire Bee Movie script to Swedish and breaking my phone


Earlier today I was texting my friend and decided to send him the Bee Movie script as a joke. I then got the bright idea of trying to translate it to a random language using my phone. Regretfully, I didn't consider the fact that sending or receiving the script as an iMessage usually crashes my messages app; it should have crossed my mind that Safari probably wouldn't do much better. 

Safari froze in the middle of translating and wouldn't open correctly, so I restarted my phone. I have since restarted it two more times and Safari is still unresponsive when I open it, and as long as the app is running my phone works very slowly.

TL;DR: I tried to translate an entire script to another language on my phone and now safari won't work.

Edit: To those of you giving me ways to fix the problem: Thank you! This post blew up overnight for me and I only just saw it, but I managed it o fix it with the clear cache thing. I'm not the most tech savvy person so wouldn't have known what to do without your comments.

Edit 2: First time making it to the front page! It feels great to know that my highest rated post is a meme-related fuck up! Thanks to all who commented/upvoted :)"

"TIFU by stealing my grandmother's chocolate


This happened not today, but many a year ago;

When I was young, my family lived very close to my maternal grandparents. Their house was just two blocks away and a couple times a week, my mother would walk over with my brother and me around lunchtime. We would all have lunch together, then my mom and grandmom would sit in the kitchen playing cards and talking while I played with my brother in the living room.

One day my brother and I were busy building a Lego city after lunch, and the grown-ups decided to put their card game on hold to watch their favorite soap opera on the living room TV. My mother shooed us out, telling us to go play in the kitchen for a while and have a snack. There was a bowl of potato chips and some soda on the table so we sat down, ate our snack, and played Go Fish with the deck of cards.

After a while, the soap was about to end and my brother and I are getting bored, so we decided to head back out to the living room. Bro ran out and, as I was leaving the kitchen, I saw a little forgotten-looking bar of chocolate on the counter. It was a segmented chocolate bar, partially wrapped in its foil wrapper, and there were only a couple of sections missing. SCORE! Being the sneaky little shit I was, I quickly pocketed it and headed back out to the Lego mess. My brother and I created blocky multi-colored worlds for a while, then I excused myself to the bathroom to eat my ill-gotten candy in secrecy, because I was greedy as well as sneaky. It tasted a little dry and stale but chocolate is chocolate and I was an eight-year-old kid, so it's all good. I squished up the empty foil wrapper, flushed it, and went back out to play.

Shortly after, my wonderful and loving grandmother came out and sweetly asked us if we took some candy that she left on the counter. Of course, we both denied it and looked up at her with our big innocent child eyes. She then got serious. She placed her fists on her hips, looked sternly down on us, and said, *""I know it was on the counter this morning. Somebody took it, and I think it was one of you kids. If either of you took it, I want you to be honest and tell me now. I will be angry, but you should not lie to your grandmother.""*

We both gave her innocent blank stares.

Grandmom pointed her finger at us, *""One of you is lying. I don't know who, and I'm done asking, but know this; God will punish whichever one of you stole that chocolate and then lied about it. When that happens, I will know it was you. So, this is your last chance to tell the truth.""*

More innocent stares and claims of innocence. She turned and went back to her card game in the kitchen without another word. I wasn't overly worried. My grandmother had a flair for theatrics and, as far as I was concerned, I had committed the perfect crime. Let them suspect me, they had no evidence so HAHA! (I'd like to again point out that I was a horrible little shit.) I assured my little brother that I didn't take it, and we went back to our Lego pile.

About 20-30 minutes later I began to feel a little... off. Nothing especially worrying, just some gurgling and rumbling in my gut like I was gassy, only without the actual gas. I tried to ignore it. Shortly after, I felt like I needed to poop. Still nothing to freak out over. It steadily and swiftly got worse. Very swiftly. After a few more minutes there was a massive *clenching* in my lower gut, I broke out in a cold sweat, and I had to get out of there *immediately*. So I dropped everything and sprinted to the upstairs bathroom. I barely had time to drop my pants and sit before my ass full-on detonated.  The cramping was horrible! Each stomach cramp was immediately followed by a high-pressure gritty liquid explosion. My ass had become Hell's fire hose and there was no sign of when it would stop.

After what seemed like forever, my digestive tract was finally empty and I sat there dazed and exhausted. I was shaking and too weak to even get up from the toilet. There was a knock on the door, then my grandmother peeked in and asked if I was okay. I told her I had a stomach ache and was sick. Her chilling response; *""This is the punishment I told you about. You should have told me the truth when you had the chance. You were able to lie to me, but God knows the truth. I want an apology, but I'm not going to punish you. I think you've suffered enough.""*

Years later, this story came up in conversation. I asked my grandmother, who was not at all religious, how she was so sure that God would punish me. Her answer; *""It was a bar of Ex Lax.""*

**TL;DR - Stole a candy bar from my grandmother, repeatedly lied about it, grandmom called down the wrath of God on my literal ass.**

"TIFU by pretending to be a mannequin


Like so many others this didn't happen yesterday, but a few years ago when I was in college.  
  
I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear.  All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat.  Not a single piece of skin was showing.  I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window.  This is where the FU happens.  I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange.  For the most part people aren't noticing me.  Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right.  That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger.  He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working.  
  
A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms.  The older fellow was black too.  He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist.  He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people.  
  
TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin.  Scared a little kid who happened to be black.  Got called a racist."

"TIFU by not opening my Reddit Secret Santa gift for months...


This happened two Christmas's ago and I want to remind everyone to make sure to open your gifts fully. 

So I have done Reddit's Secret Santa exchange the past few years. The first 3 years tried it, I sent my gifts and had got nothing back in return. I was on my final straw with the exchange and because I was putting a good effort in my gifts, I wanted something cool in exchange. 

I made my bio on the Secret Santa page and showed all my interests. I talked about my dog, how much I love soccer and all sports, my favorite teams, and other hobbies. I was hoping this would be the year...Well about a week before Christmas, I get a package that has written in sharpie all over it, ""REDDIT SECRET SANTA!!!!"" 
I was stoked to say the least. My roommates gathered around to see what was in the box...an electric toothbrush still sealed in the box(looked like this http://i.imgur.com/bcrSJ22.jpg). I was so bummed. My roommates laughed, I laughed (but was a little mad). I said something along the lines of, ""I guess when my toothbrush breaks I can use this one.""

About 5 months go by and Im using my old electric toothbrush and it suddenly breaks. My Secret Santa gift will now come in handy! I go into my closet and pull out the box. I cut the tape and inside is not an electric toothbrush....It's a hand painted mug with two of my favorite soccer teams badges. I started laughing and was pumped! I felt like a fool for not even opening the box for months. It was one of the best gifts I have received in a long time and I use this mug almost every day for my beer, chocolate milk, water. 

So thank you random Secret Santa Redditor. I will continue to do Secret Santa because of you! 

http://imgur.com/a/UetSS

TL;DR: Thought I got an electric toothbrush for my Secret Santa gift...turned out to be an awesome hand painted mug with my favorite soccer teams.  

edit: picture links

Edit 2: if my secret Santa sees this , thanks again!!!

edit 3: I got my toothbrush replaced, costco warranties. Maybe I picked the wrong picture for the box. I dont think it was a limited edition toothbrush. just a normal oral b toothbrush. 

edit 4: I can't believe people thought a puppy was in the box...and for the people who wanted to see my dog http://i.imgur.com/7i6zJXl.jpg

Edit 5: OH its the same mug! Liverpool on one side, Inter on the other. "
"TIFU by locking eyes with my neighbour as I peed


Our bathroom is on the second story with a small window high up above the toilet facing our neighbours place.

I am pretty tall so when I stand there to pee my eyeline is directly out the window looking into their kitchen on the first floor.

The other day I was standing there taking a piss when I accidentally locked eyes with the wife of the neighbours household. Goddam that was awkward.
Then today a similar thing happened when I was standing there doing my business and we locked eyes again. We both looked around awkwardly but I wasn't done yet so I just had to keep standing there. In a couple of seconds she checked to see if I was still there and we locked eyes again! At this point she gestures to her husband who looks up and now we lock eyes! 

I was there thinking ""what is wrong with these people? Why would they stare at me while I am trying to pee? Weirdos."" 

It was only just then that I realised that these people have no idea that I am peeing, they have no clue what room of the house I am in. To them I am just some freak who stands at the window a few times a day and stares at them. Even worse I am some freak who gets caught perving into their home and I just look around awkwardly for a few seconds then just keeps on looking at them!
So.... yeah... fuck. Now I have to crouch down while I pee.

TL;DR: I keep locking eyes with my neighbours through the window as I pee and it is extremely awkward. "
"TIFU By not paying attention at Subway on National Sandwhich Day


This happened yesterday so in good TIFU tradition, not actually today!  

Girlfriend and I went to Subway to get our sandwich on in honor of National Sandwich Day courtesy of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. While discussing whether we should get 12"" or 6"" subs the Subway Man overheard and misinterpreted our discussion as our order and since they were rather busy began making our sandwiches... All 72"" of them. Before we could say anything he had 4 of them already covered in our desired meat/meatballs and was asking us what cheese we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene we looked at each other and both nodded in agreement and said ""Fuck It, we've gotten this far...""  

I'm happy to say we are now the proud owners of Six 12"" Subway Subs and will be eating Subway non-stop for at least a couple days. Thankfully it is only cost the price of 3 Subs so it didn't break the bank.  

TL;DR Celebrated National Sandwhich Day in the correct fashion, ordered 6 Subs instead of 2 because I'm to socially awkward to correct a mistake.

EDIT: Words, now that I'm on PC instead of phone.  

EDIT 2: Replaced the restaurants name with &lt;Redacted&gt; (Bravo's Sub Par Sandwiches) &lt;Redacted&gt; to prevent r/hailcorporate from having a HayDay.  
  
Edit 3: Due to popular request changed it back Subway"

"TIFU by using lube NSFW


Actually happened today. My wife and I had decided to have some fun relation times. We normally keep our happy fun time juice on the stand next to our bed, (no kids) so I reach for it and proceed. After the deed was done, I noticed I was feeling some odd tickling near my no-no zone. Looked down and saw an ant crawling around.

Now I'm all down for third partners, but this guy just shoved his way in. I disposed of it, only to have a brief moment of insight. The ants that are very common to this area are obsessed with sweets. I glance over at the bottle, and sure enough, ant orgy.

I then realize that they are most likely all up in my SO.

Shit. 

She's currently in the shower while I type this.

Tldr: used ant covered lube for sexy times with wife.

Edit (Update): Wife is still pretty grossed out, but she appears to have gotten them all. We estimate about 15 or so. She at least finds it funny."
"TIFU by wiping s*** on my face and not noticing until my wife pointed it out.


So I'll give a bit of background; I've been sick for the past few days and had my nose clogged for about 3 by now. Being the weekend, I stayed home and tried to get better. Often times I would find myself in front of the tv, with some tea and tissues. 

Last night, at around 1:00 in the morning, I woke up to use the bathroom. My wife was asleep so I tried being quiet. Half asleep, I groggily walked over to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet. 

I did my business and got up to wipe. While up, I thought might as well blow my nose, and clear my clogged nostrils. Being that I was full of NyQuil, and just got up, I hadn't noticed I used the same piece of toilet paper.  

The same....piece....of TP!!! (Pause to imagine previously described s##tuation). 

Simply put, I went back to bed and having a clogged nose (still), hadn't noticed the aroma, propagating in front of my face. 

My wife woke me a few minutes after the incident. If I recall her words correctly, it was something along the lines of, 'What smells like s###? Wait is that you? WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE S### MARK?!?'

After realizing the horror of the situation, I went to in the mirror expecting a huge glob of human product on my face. 

Having wiped more than once, I didn't have much on my face, but when my sense of scent returned I noticed a prominent stank that made me dry-heave a bit. 

I washed the smell off returned to bed but had trouble sleeping over the sound of snickers coming from the left side of the bed. 

TL;DR 
•clogged nose 
•had to s###
• wiped, then blew my 
nose with s### covered TP


Edit: too clear up some confusion, I do in fact wipe standing since that's how I was taught. 

Edit 2: I also do sleep on the right side of the bed, for which difference it makes I had no knowledge of. 

Edit 3: I'm also not afraid to curse, I just don't like to read at work and see me boss read curse words over my shoulder. 

Edit 4: I also did wash my hands. I forgot to mention.
