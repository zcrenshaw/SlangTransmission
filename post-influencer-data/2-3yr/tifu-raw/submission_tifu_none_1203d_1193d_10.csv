"TIFU by talking about my graduate research in public


I'm a PhD student in Chemical engineering and doing research on gas hydrates. I do research using high pressure reactors. This morning I was taking the bus to work and mentioned on the phone to someone how we collect our high pressure samples using [sample cylinders](http://store.clarksonlab.com/images/products/detail/K27851.jpg)... Except... we commonly use the term ""sample bomb""... And I said that on the phone... 

I got a few eyes on me but nothing too alarming until i got off the bus about 15 minutes later and 2 police officers were waiting for me. They asked me a bunch of questions and I tried to explain how a sample bomb isn't actually a bomb... They even made a few calls to corroborate what I was telling them before letting me go...

TL;DR Almost got arrested for using the research related term ""sample bomb"" in public."

"TIFU by showing my daughter videos of the Japanese Tsunami.


My 7 year old daughter told me how cool tsunamis are and wish one would hit our town. I told her they are terrible and told her about the one in Japan in 2011 and how it had killed around 20,000 people. She didn't believe me so I showed her a video on YouTube of a Japanese town getting obliterated by one. She freaked out, started screaming. We live by the sea and she is now convinced one will hit our town. The swell is quite big at the moment and you can hear the waves crashing from our house and it's freaking her out. Like a good big sis she told my 3 year old how we're all going to die, which freaked her out. I've had nearly 6 hrs of crying and screaming. They've made a camp on the top bunk and have been there for 2 hrs. Quiet at the moment...I'm resisting the urge to shout ""tsunami!!!""....

EDIT: Thanks for all the posts, this really exploded. I understand this got pulled earlier so not sure if you'll see this....probably those terrible incest posts. You'll be pleased to know there were no tsunamis today. For those wanting to know where we are in New Zealand. These were the videos I showed her:

"TIFU by accidentally sending one of my soldiers to assassinate a friends dog.


I am the commanding officer for a small band of soldiers, who undertake various missions as assigned. My group of soldiers however, are 2-3cm tall, green, and totally inanimate.  
     
As I actually work in IT, my job can be a little dull occasionally, when going somewhere to repair something, I usually bring one of my soldiers with me, to assist with my mission, enter their base of operations, establish a command point and work surveillance.    
  
Once I have done my job in hand, I will sneakily leave one of my little army men there, usually precariously hidden slightly out of sight. So far over 30 people have been left with the protection of one of my trusty brigade.    

Today I was alerted to the fact that one of my troops has went AWOL and potentially endangered one of my friends dogs. I received a text asking ""If I had left a little green army man"" toy at his house?""  
   
I surrendered immediately as I would not want one of my soldiers to be harmed in their mission, and I admitted ""I had left a little soldier there, yes"" and playfully added “What are your terms to ensure the safe release of my soldier?”  
  
5 minutes later I received another text saying that my friend had spent over 25 minutes this morning trying to remove it from his dogs throat because he had found my soldier and decided it would be a fantastic chew toy. Since Yorkshire Terriers are small dogs, he was horrified that I had potentially choked and killed his dog...   
  
Mission failed I guess. My troop have raised the flag for their fallen comrade.

TLDR: Leaving toy soldiers at friends houses and offices could potentially kill a dog.

"TIFU by wetting my boyfriend's bed


Reddit, my body betrayed me. 

You know how sometimes you have those dreams where you use the toilet.... and then you wake up and *luckily* they didn't come true? Well I wasn't so lucky.

This morning, around 5am, I woke up with a strange feeling as though I had just peed. I snuck a hand down there to check, and yup, at 24 years old, I wet the bed. 

If I were in my own bed it would be no big deal. But I had stayed the night at my boyfriend's, and he was in the bed next to me. So I did what any mortified girl would do, and [panic-messaged my best friend](http://imgur.com/a/f2pKz).

After about half an hour of stressing about what to do, I finally woke him up, confessed, and burst into tears. After his initial horror, he was very understanding and we got up and changed the sheets (after a long series of terrible puns, i.e. he said he's not *pissed off* -_- )"
"TIFU by losing my sister in the Suicide Forest.


Currently in Aokigahara, at a fork in the trail, writing this.  Some back story is needed?

Every year, I visit Japan. As a whole, it is a very lovely country and I enjoy meeting new people. I plan out my trips very meticulously because I tend to freak out if my plans deviate in the slightest. It is a very stressful, but well-worth it when it pans out.

My younger sister is a morbid little sucker. She's keen on anything creepy, and sometimes that's a problem for me.  I can't tolerate the spooky.  I go into panic mode and immediately assume the worst case scenario is happening. You know that terrible movie called The Forest that just came out? She loved it and wanted to go there on this trip. Something about finding dead bodies and updoots, whatever the hell that means. I managed to plan a hiking trip for today, and the area is actually pretty cool. We went into lava caves near the base of Mt Fuji and got to see bats. There was also an underground ice cave with enormous blocks of ice. So far so good, right?

Except my dumb ass got distracted by bright red motherfucking mushrooms and I started taking pictures and lagging behind. When I stood up, she wasn't there. 

Oh crap.

After two hours of running up and down the trails, I still can't find her. She might have gone off trail. I'm back at the spot where I last saw her and decided to wait. It's getting cold, and threatening to rain. I'm the only one holding the mobile WiFi device, so I can't reach her cellphone (which is in Airplane mode, btw). I hope she pops out of it to call. 

I have to pee, but I don't want to get murdered by ghosts or falling in a hole. I give it 30 more minutes here before I go find someone at the park office to help me.

Will update.

**UPDATE**: I hear police sirens going off in the distance. I'm worried, going to go in that direction to find help.

**UPDATE 2**: I have peed in Aokigahara. It has literally scared the piss out of me.

**UPDATE 3**: My sister has been found! She ran into a police officer after finding a person hanging by the side of the road. She went to ask for directions, but they didn't respond. That's when she saw the nylon rope. She was following a line of red tape to get back on the path and hailed down the officer, but he already knew. We're going home, she's pretty shook up.

**EDIT**: Here's some of the details I posted throughout the thread:

 [Mushrooms](http://imgur.com/a/aUFQo), [Caves](http://imgur.com/a/Qb64w) and [Trees](http://imgur.com/a/WAbbN).  Taken using my cellphone camera, I know they're kind of shitty.

• I was waiting at the fork in the road for her, so I had some time to kill. I forced myself to calm down, take a seat, and wait for her to come back. Running down the trails was getting me nowhere, and she had to pass back through the fork to get back to the bat cave. So I had some time to reddit. As long as you don't stray off the path, it's really easy to navigate. I didn't want to walk 15km trying to find her, so staying in the spot I last saw her sounded like a good plan.

• The fork I was at is about 1.2km from the Saiko Bat Cave. There's a colored map board at the junction.

**To visualize**:
Pull up google maps of the Saiko lake area. There is a main road that loops all the way around the forest. There are a series of trails that intersect the area. I was at the junction where four of those trails converged. The other trails dump you out on the main road or the caves. The bat and ice caves actually have an attendant and gift shop attached. She found him near the main road, at the mouth of the trailhead. Dude probably wanted to be found, he was in plain view from the path.  She ran into the police officer right around the corner on the main road. I’m not sure if the red tape was his doing, or if another hiker had discovered the body and roped it off while he got help.  

**TL;DR:** Go to suicide forest, expect to see suicides in forest."
"TIFU by trying to walk 2 miles in 122 degree heat.


This actually happened just over 10 years ago, but since reddit is talking about those people dying in the heatwave, it reminded me of this.

So it was Las Vegas around 2000 or 2001 if I remember correctly.  It was 122 degrees that day but it was a ""dry heat""  :P  (sorry, had to put that joke in there)  

Well, my car was at the repair shop and they called for me to come pick it up.  The shop was only 2 miles away, but at the time, I didn't think it was 2 miles.  I thought it was ""like a 5 or 10 minute walk""  It would only be later when I actually drove it to see how far it was that I would find out it was two miles.   So I grabbed a 12 oz soda (because you gotta stay hyrdrated, right?) and went on my way.  I walked barely a few hundred feet before I started feeling thirsty, so I cracked open the soda.  It was finished before I was even half a mile into my journey.  This is where I thought about turning back home, but then I thought ""well, I told them I was coming and I really need my car"" so I kept walking.  3/4 of a mile in and I'm realizing this wasn't a good idea.  And then this is when the REALLY bad idea came.  It was taking so long for me to walk there, I said ""if I run, I'll get there faster""   Now it's not really a good idea to run in 122 degree heat and its not a good idea to run after you just downed a soda, but I did it anyway.  I'm about to cross Sahara Blvd and I notice everyone in their cars are looking at me.  Some laughing, and some mouthing the words ""oh my God!""  I just kind of smiled and kept going.

I'm now a little more than half way and I'm completely out of energy, but the sun is beating down on me and at this point I just want to find some shade.  I have also stopped running because I cant really catch my breath.  Every breath in is hot air.  I see two small trees, but they seem so far away although they are probably only 100 feet away.  I really just want to stop walking completely, but the sun is so painful on my skin (I was wearing a tank top) that I had to keep going.  I get to the shade and spent about 30 minutes there just trying to catch my breath.  

I'm now extremely thirsty, extremely hot and I'm finding it odd that I'm not sweating.  I really feel like I'm going to pass out, but I know I'm really close to the mechanic.  I'm trying to walk, but my feet are starting to ignore my brain's command to keep walking.  I say to myself ""come on, just walk 5 more feet""  as soon as I walk those 5 feet, I stop and rest, but my heart just wont stop pounding even after I've rested.  I'm also finding it odd that I can't seem to walk in a straight line.  I'm weaving back and forth on the sidewalk like a drunk person.   

Somehow, I finally get to the mechanic and I see a hose on the side of the building.  I go and turn it on and start drinking.  Best tasting hose water I ever had.  I sprayed the water over my head and it felt so cool.  I'm not sure how long I was drinking the water for, but it felt like a long time.   I checked my watch and it took me 1 hour 45 minutes to walk those two miles.  Funny enough, even after I drank the water and cooled down, I didn't realize the seriousness of what could have happened to me until years later.  At the time I felt like ""oh I just got a little hot because of the weather and I was tired because I hadn't exercised in a few months so maybe I was a little more out of shape than I thought"" not realizing that I was literally on deaths door.

TL;DR Got heatstroke in Vegas, almost died and didn't know it."
"Tifu by using a hair product from a foreign country without understanding what the hair product did




So this happened several years ago but I still think of it. I was a junior in high school, having had 3 very sketchy years of German for my foreign language. I had the opportunity to do a home stay with a German family for a month during the summer. I packed the typical travel toiletries in small amounts...hair gel, hair spray etc. the family I stayed with had 2 girls my age and I attended school with them. After a few weeks my 'travel' toiletries ran out and I was unsure what to do. I was
Preparing for school one morning and decided I would 'borrow' the hair products that my host family used. I looked in their bathroom cabinet and found a hair mousse canister. I nervously and quickly read the label. 'Fur das Haar'  (for the hair). Yes! Hair mousse! More words after that...but those are unnecessary.. It just explains the details of the product.  I need this mousse! So I surreptitiously dispensed the 'mousse' into my palm and distributed into my wet hair. This German mousse smells like crap! But you know....I'm in Germany...they have cruddy hair products here. So...A bit more here and there. Blow dry...some eyeliner and I'm ready for German school!  

The dad of the family drove use to school in his Mercedes. There was traffic....it was warm...the car starts smelling of this German 'mousse' I put in my hair. The dad very casually cracks the Windows of the car....I start getting slightly nervous. 'Was that really mousse? Why does it smell so chemically?!?' After what seemed like FOREVER we get to school and I dash out of the car. I'm starting to doubt my decision to borrow their hair mousse. 

In class the air flow is better and no one seems to notice my chemical stench. But I do... It's become an alarm bell in my head. THIS IS NOT RIGHT!  I casually run my hand through my long auburn hair and to my horror, the hair comes out in my hand. Shocked, I run my hand again through my hair again. More horrible globs of hair in between my fingers! Horrified, I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom. I stuck my head under the faucet to get the mousse our of my hair. My hair came out in the sink with the mousse. I had put hair remover in my hair!!!!  Who has ever heard of hair remover in mousse form?!?!!! I ran to the office and my host mother picked me up from the school. She took me to a salon where she whispered to the stylist in German so fast I couldn't understand. The stylist cut my hair (what was left of it) into a pixie cut and I was sent home in shame. The next day the entire school knew of the American girl who had put hair remover in her hair. I had to return from my trip and start my senior year. with almost no hair on my head. 

TIFU/ by not asking for help and using products that I couldn't read and that didn't belong to me. Fur das Haar  can mean many things. Don't just assume German mousse smells like death. "
"TIFU by smoking too much weed and scaring my girlfriend


So this happened last night.

Last night I wanted to relax in my favorite way, so I go out to smoke and do my thing. I came back inside and realized I smoked a little more than usual and my girlfriend kept staring at me, I was trying to be chill but I twitch when I get really high. 

After a little Battlefield 4 I decided it was Netflix time so I put on Louie (which is one of my favorite shows to watch when I am stoned). The next thing I know, i'm asleep. Then all of a sudden I hear a lady screaming in pain, screaming for help.

The woman I rent from (let's call her M) needs a new kidney and is on dialysis at home, so my first thought is that M is screaming for help cuz something happened. I flip over and start saying to my girlfriend who is watching videos on her ipad with earbuds in ""M! She's screaming for help! What do we do!?"". My girlfriend starts to freak out at this point.

We both look at eachother worried, and then she gets a confused look on her face. She then starts telling me i'm an idiot, and I am confused because I'm thinking M needs to go to the ER and we need to do something. My girlfriend then tells me to look at the TV.

I left the the TV on and a lady was screaming for help on the show. My girlfriend will never let me live this down, and now she disapproves of my marijuana use even more."
"TIFU by scalding my genitals (possible NSFW)


So this literally happened within the last half hour. 

Back story: my wife is just over 40 weeks pregnant and this morning we came to the hospital for an induction. She was having really bad contractions, so the midwife kindly offered her a nice hot bath to relax her and help my son come into this world.

Anyway, onto the fuck up. So I go to the bathroom with my lovely wife as she is not allowed to be left on her own. She strips off and gets into the bath when I realise that I need to piss, like, right now. No biggie, I'll just go to the loo in the bathroom, it's nothing my wife hasn't seen before. Wrong! No toilet in this room, just a bath and sink. 

So I do what any other man would do in that situation. I look to the sink and then to my wife. She knows what I'm thinking and just shakes her head and tells me a firm ""No!"". I give her the sweet puppy dog eyes that got her to agree to mate with me in the first place and she caves within seconds. Anyway, I'm no animal so I decide to run some water whilst I'm doing the deed to wash it all down. 

After I finish, I still have my meat and two veg out whilst I turn off the tap. This is the part where I learn three very important things:

1. I had actually been using hot water
2. These taps turn off the opposite way to what I am expecting
3. [This sign](https://imgur.com/3pJC2FY) is extremely accurate

I had turned the taps on full blast of near boiling water inches away from my favourite body part. I took a fair amount of splash damage and while I was dancing around this small room with my pecker flailing around thinking what a numpty I've been, my wife was just laughing her ass off at me.

Aaannnd now her waters have broken, so I might be delayed responding to any comments.

Edit: [my little boy](http://imgur.com/l71316f) arrived around 3hrs after my post! Thanks for all your kind messages, now time to dad! "
"TIFU by trying to lose my virginity (NSFW)


This happened this past Friday night/ Saturday morning. 

I always been shy and depressed so talking with people is hard for me. Even harder to talk with women. Plus I don't think of myself as very attractive and thing women wouldn't be interested in my anyways. 

I am 25 and a virgin. I never kissed a girl or even held a girls hand before. So I figured I do what everyone seems to do in the movies and go to a bar and see what happens. I don't drink but I have read it can make you less shy and more out going. What could possible go wrong?

Its Friday evening and I decided to go downtown and find a nice bar with lots of people. Got there around 6 pm and sat down at those stools at the counter. The lady behind the counter asked me what I wanted and since I don't drink I had no idea and just told her this is my first time.

She starts listing off bunch of stuff like beers, cocktails, shots and bunch of other stuff I really can't remember. I figured I would try a little of everything and see what I like.

I started off with a Molsen Canadian. One of the few beers I actually do know. Tasted horrible, they all tasted horrible. But I kept drinking one after the other and just having random beers and shots and cocktails. After the 3rd one I felt a little sick and threw up in the bathroom. Felt much better after puking. 

Its about 1 am, not sure how many drinks I have had. I probably puked about 4 times and still have not chatted with anyone except the lady behind the counter who was the one asking me what I wanted to drink. I trip and my glasses get knocked off as I was making my way to the door. A woman picks them hands puts them on my face and asks me if I was all right. Told her I was fine and just had to much to drink. 

We both head outside and start walking and she asks me where I was headed. Told her I was going the skytrain to go home. She grabs my arm and pulls me towards her and wraps her arm in mine and said the skytrain is closed this late and why don't I just stay the night at her place.

We get to her place and as soon as we walk into her apartment she starts kissing me and I am standing there like an idiot. I never kissed before so didn't really know how to. She happened to guess what I never done this before so she said she would teach me. At this point I am getting excited and nervous at the same time that somehow I will fuck it all up. After some kissing she takes my pants off and I am already hard. She teases me with her tongue then proceeds to give me a blowjob. I take off her shirt and she goes back to blowing me as I tried to take off her bra. Words can't describe the feeling or my emotions as it was finally happening. But it didn't last long as I had just managed to  take her bra off that I felt something run down my penis. I didn't realize what it was until the smell hit me. She had puked on me while giving me a blowjob. The smell and the sight of her puking soon took over me and I also vomited all over her head.

I pulled up my vomit covered pants and ran to the bathroom and quickly got into the shower. Started to wash myself and my clothes the best I could. She having taken off all her clothes came into the shower with me and apologized repeatedly as I did the same.

I got out quickly, grabbed my stuff and left as she was still in the shower. Its about 3 am maybe and since no trains were running I walked around in the cold, rainy night.

Once I finally got home I quickly took another shower for god knows how long. Luckily it was a Saturday and my family was still asleep. Went to my room and passed out.

I wake up to my phone ringing but I couldn't move my body. I just laid there on the bed with my eyes closed and a massive headache. My whole body was in pain. I eventually fell back asleep and just woke up few hours ago. I took another shower and when I got to back to my room I noticed I had about 4 calls from her and dozen or so text messages. I don't remember giving her my phone number so not sure how she got it. The texts all were basically her apologizing and wanting to make it up to me. I  have yet to respond and don't really know what to say.

TL;DR: Lonely virgin. Got drunk. Met a girl. Things got wet, really wet.


Edit: I was pasted out for maybe 30 hours. By the time I saw her missed calls and texts it was around 10:30 pm and didn't want to call her in case she is sleeping. Pretty sure she has work in the morning. I do plan on calling her tomorrow.

Also I left without saying anything because I never been in such a situation and was just overwhelmed with fear. For what, I don't really know. I never drank before and had no idea what was happening. I tend to over think everything. All I remember when I left was fear that this wasn't my house and I would get charged for breaking in or something. I really didn't remember much until I read those texts. I am surprised I even remember anything since I read drinking to much can make you forget things.


-- As for being confident, that was taken away from me long time ago. Few years back I tried random apps to meeting people since it was easier for me to chat to people through text. I didn't get any replies for a period of few months. So I decided to simple remove my pictures and descriptions of me and somehow I met tons of girls on apps and online. How ever when they asked to see me and I showed them a pic of myself they stopped responding. Not even gradually less talking over time, nope, just a dead stop in replies after they saw my pic. I don't know if its because of me being unattractive or because of the color of my skin or whatever. I simply decided to not show pics of myself and didn't say the color of my skin and just told them I wasn't ready. I figured if they got to know the real me things would be different. Some pressured me and I just told them I didn't want to say. Some where okay with it and others weren't. Those that were, we chatted for months, a few even chatting online and text for years. After chatting with them for this long I thought they obliviously like me for me, why else would they chat with me for thing long? So I decided to tell them and what happened? The exact same thing that always happened. They stopped responding. For someone to throw away months and even years of being friends simply because of they way you look takes a huge fucking hit to your confidence. 

Out of all those years of chatting, only two didn't judge me and still talked to me. And those two people I considered my best friends. Those two gave me a reason to keep trying. They mean everything to me.

Also I wasn't trying to hook up with any of them. Just needed someone to talk to and from there see how things go. They all know I was talking to multiple people as I told them. I believe in being honest is one of the most important things. --

"TIFU by forgetting to cleanup after masturbating (NSFW)


Lets get right into it. I was home alone and decided it was a convenient time to have some fun. I had heard my friends talking about the “mattress baggie” masturbation trick. To sum it up quickly, you put on a condom and penetrate the spot between the mattress and box spring. Sounds weird, I know. 

Anyways, so I decided to give it a try but my bed was way too low. On the other hand, my sister’s bed was the perfect height. There was no turning back and I went forward with it. It was amazing and I went to bed afterwards, waking up two hours later to the sound of my mother and father screaming. They were in my little sister’s room so I ran over and that’s when I realized what had happened. My mom was holding a cum filled condom that she found **on** my sisters dresser. That’s when I realized I had forgotten to clean up. My father got a baseball bat and was heading towards the neighbors house. They were undergoing construction and my parents came up with the thought that one of the contractors snuck into our house and masturbated in my little sisters room. 

That’s when I had to explain everything to them. It was the most awkward moment of my life and I’m literally cringing while typing this. Imagine telling your parents that you just masterbated with a condom in your little sisters room (I left out the fact that I just fucked a mattress). Needless to say, we never spoke about it again. 

TL;DR masturbated with a condom in my little sisters room and parents almost called the cops

Edit 1: no i'm not a pedo. My sisters been staying at my grandmothers house for over a year. Room is practically empty.

Edit 2: Popular question, my little sister is staying at my grandmothers house because she has special needs and my parents work forces them to move a lot. 

Edit 3: The infamous drawer in my sisters room is visible as you walk past the room. I'm guessing they noticed the condom on top of it while walking by to their room. 

Edit 4: Yes, I know I fucked up badly by forgetting to cleanup. After I finished, I put the cum filled condom on top of the drawer to go wash my genitals. The plan was to dispose of it afterwards. I don't know how the fuck I forgot. It was my first time masterbating with a condom. "
