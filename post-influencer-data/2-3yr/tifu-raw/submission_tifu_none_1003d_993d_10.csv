"TIFU by changing a client's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu


This just happened 2 hours ago.


I work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


I had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled ""sexy pikachu"". Found [the one](http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.


I quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client's computer. You changed their background, not mine.""


I shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she's the owner's daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. He's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


I stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say ""Ok, send her over to me."" I'm a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it's really best I talk to her.


I answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what's going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""Hey, I'm locking my computer for you"" or ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


TL;DR Tried to change coworker's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager."
"TIFU by watching That 70s Show


I live with my boyfriend and his parents, we all get along great and I couldn't be happier. Today, I had just come off a gruelling 15 hour shift, I was exhausted but I wanted to spend some time with my boyfriend before bed, so we put on the TV. That 70s Show was on, popular show in this household, we both sat down to watch. 

SPOILER ALERT

It was the episode in which Eric and Donna break up. 

Being the soft hearted human I am, I begin to tear up, and between the sheer level of tiredness I feel, the heartbreak on TV and the relentless teasing of my boyfriend, I begin to start hysterically sobbing. I ran up the stairs to the bathroom, passing his mother on my way, who stopped me to ask what was wrong. I tried to explain the fictional TV break up through my tears, and of course the only words she heard were ""break up"". 
She started to cry, she shouted to her husband to ""come quick, something has happened"" and she held me tight and told me I will be okay, she ran downstairs to check on my ""ex""boyfriend. Subsequently, he thinks it's hilarious and decides to play along, acting like there was a huge dramatic break up scene between the two of us and that it's all over with no chance of reconciliation. Neither me or his mother can speak for crying, he's laughing like an absolute maniac and his father is nowhere to be seen... 
As it turns out, he was showering when his mother screamed for him, he jumped to get out of the shower, slipped, fell, broke his ankle, tried to stand up again, slipped again and face planted the edge of the bath and broke his nose. 
(Edit: boyfriends father is on the mend and thinks this is the funniest thing to ever happen) 

TL;DR I cried at a TV show, accidentally convinced my boyfriend's mum I had broken up with her son, and his dad broke an ankle and his nose trying to help. 
(Edit 2: I can't believe I have got gold for this! I knew one day being over emotional would get me somewhere, haha!! Thanks to everyone who commented and voted, so glad my FU made you all smile) "
"TIFU my first date.


I'm a very socially awkward person.

So when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!

The night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

I get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.

Here's where it went south.

We're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, ""I got this.""  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying ""Oh, you don't have t-"". 

I cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a ""After you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

Without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

Maybe next time."
"Tifu by accidentally becoming gay on New Years


Well here goes, t'was the night of new years and i was at a friends place just outside of town. Our group had planned on having this sort of ""grown up night"" instead of a New Years party. We had planned on getting together making a three course dinner and playing games and just enjoying ourselves. Yeah I know. (The reason being is that the majority of us in this group of 13 are in relationships. 5 couples and 3 single boys to be exact) anyways as the night went by we kept joking about having no New Years kiss and so on and me and my friend, we'll call him Dave, start joking about being each others New Years kiss.

Okay you need to have this in mind: I'm a guy who's not really into the hummus business but I don't really back off when it comes to kissing dudes or making out with another with them for that matter. I figure ""hey thats just another person, kissing another dude doesn't mean i enjoy getting my plum penetrated by another mans love stick. 

Anyways the count down begins and we just go for it (just a small kiss on the lips and nothing more). Just for the sake of the meme we hold each other, in an unholy position that only love birds whom are about to marry one another should hold, and start enjoying the fireworks. At this point one of the so called ""females"" notices us and starts to laugh and doesn't believe that we actually kissed so just to fuck with her we go at each other as if our life depended on it. Someone films this on the platform know to man as snapchat and sends it to world with the caption ""so glad they finally came out"". The night continues and so does the party.

The next day me and Dave are in town and enjoying our afterparty tradition which is hungover kebab-pizza with extra garlic sauce and this random couple (16 or something, my little sisters friends) congratulate us. We don't think of it much and just assume they mean new year. We go home to my place to play some video games and hangout and thus my father happens. He congratulates us as well and tells Dave he's glad that I chose him out of all the other people in an awkward manner. I still haven't got it but Dave's laughing his ass off. I ask my dad if he can leave us alone and he tells me ""oh i see you want some space to do your thing now that there's no hiding it."" and winks. That's when I realize and panic. It turns out some asshole saved the snapchat video (somehow) and shared it on facebook. Being in a small town, everyone wanted to show that they're tolerant and fund of these so called ""hummus-people"" so everyone liked and shared the video.

It's January the 2nd and everywhere i go people congratulate me. Yayy. I guess I'm a gay now.

Edit: Well that escalated quickly. Yay we managed to get the comments locked. 

Edit 2: Eyyy thanks for the gold random stranger. I literally have no clue what to do with reddit gold though.

tldr: made out with a friend (guy) on New Years as a joke. It went viral. Everyone in my town thinks I'm homosexual. I guess I'm gay now.

"TIFU by not sleeping and ending up with permanent brain damage


This happened almost a year ago exactly, on January 2nd.

I've snowboarded almost my entire life, and would consider myself decent. My dad got a hold of me the day before this happened wanting to go on our first ski trip for the season. 

Now the prior season I had damaged one of my boards beyond repair and hadn't gotten around to getting a new one, so I decided to use an old one (first mistake). I stayed up all night stripping it down and giving it a new paint job. Didn't get a minute of sleep. In my sleep deprived state, I accidentally switched my left and right binding when I put them back on, didn't wax the board, and forgot my helmet when I was loading up the car.

6+ hour drive later, get to the resort and realize I forgot my helmet, and stupidly thought I'd be fine without one because I've snowboarded so long. First trip down the slopes went alright, but second trip down I'm having problems controlling the board because the bindings were switched, and I didn't wax or edge it. I hit a patch of ice and catch way too much speed and my two options are hit the little kid that just cut in front of me and definitely hurt him, or go off what I **thought** was a short drop off to the side of the trail.

Of course I decided to go off the very much not short drop off. End up falling ~15 feet before the tip of the board catches in ice, slamming me head first into the hard ice. Roll another 50 feet so so, hitting every imaginable spot on my head. Almost blacked out, super out of it. I sit there for 20 minutes, board snapped in half, goggles and hat 50 feet behind me.

Finally manage to get my stuff and get down the hill to find my dad, who refused to get ski patrol cause it was ""just a headache"". Called them myself, got told I was fine and eyes rolled at me. Dad drives me 6 hours home instead of taking me to the hospital down the road. Mom proceeded to take me to the hospital, where it was confirmed there was some heavy brain damage.

Fast forward through a year of countless appointments with neurologists, occupational therapy, hospital visits, missing almost the entire last semester of my senior year and nearly didn't graduate, and took a semester off before I start college. I'm left with ADHD like problems, mood swings, horrible coordination, problems sleeping, a stutter on occasion, and many other problems.

Wear your helmet kids.

TLDR; Didn't sleep, didn't wear a helmet snowboarding, permanent brain damage and problems for likely many years to come

Edit: Yes, I know I was an idiot. And yes, I know this was my fault. I just thought I'd share so others don't make the same stupid decisions as I do.

If you guys are really that concerned about this being a karma grab, I mentioned my TBI in a couple of comments a few months ago

"TIFU by not washing down a bloody nose out of my bath tub


Last night around 4am, I got one of my worst bloody noses I've ever had (gross, I know). Due to the nature of said nosebleed, I basically have to stand in my shower and let it bleed out and no amount of Kleenex will stop it. It finally stops bleeding and my tub looks like a war zone. 

Usually, I would wash it down. However, it was 4am, and I didn't want to wake up my parents or sister with running water. I left it for today. 

This morning, I'm woken up by my mom screeming. Before I have time to comprehend what's going on, she storms into my room screaming ""please be alive,"" thinking I've cut myself. 

I sleep naked. It's far more comfy that having your junk be constrained by boxers. However my mom doesn't know this. I struggled with her to keep myself covered up. I lose, and I'm naked as a jaybird and embarrassed as hell. 

I ask what the problem is and she is asking if I'm suicidal. Confused, I ask her why would she think that and she said ""your bath tub!"" Oh fuck. Had to explain that I had a nose bleed and didn't want to wake her at 4am.

Tl;Dr I got a bad bloody nose, didn't wash it down, and mom though I was suicidal."
"TIFU By Putting My Dildo In The Dishwasher


**PART I**
The Mistake 

It was my day to do the dishes. I just got this dildo as a present from my girlfriend. It's plastic, lime green, and vaguely penis shaped but not obvious. 

I share a bathroom with my sister (8 years my junior) and couldn't risk being caught scrubbing it in the sink, and didn't know if hand sanitizer/wipes would be thorough enough, so as a last resort, I threw it in the top rack of the dishwasher. Usually my family avoids housework like the plague, so I wasn't worried about anyone touching the dishwasher. I loaded the detergent, pressed ""start"", and waited anxiously for the cycle to finish. I got up to plug my phone in, and having been up all night before studying, fell asleep. 

I woke up three hours later and raced to unload the dishwasher. There, like a lemon scented Freudian nightmare, was my mother in her yellow dish gloves, holding my dildo. 

""Mom, I can explain this--"" she cut me off, ""Don't worry, I should have told you."" I looked at her, confused. ""I know it's your day to wash up but you'd been studying so hard I didn't want to wake you. I forgot to tell you we need to unload early today because your grandparents are coming for dinner."" My mother talks with her hands, so as she tells me my grandparents are visiting, she's flailing the sex toy around like a baton. 

She says ""But I was wondering,"" (in reference to my dildo) ""where does this go, I don't recognize it."" I was at a loss for words. Because of the plastic and the bright color, and you know, finding it in the kitchen, she apparently assumed it was some sort of cooking utensil. ""Oh, is it one of those wands to drizzle sauce?"" Panicked I just vigorously nodded my head while she put it away in a drawer. 

I spent the next two hours plotting how to sneak it out of there, but she was cooking right from the time she found it. She didn't even stop for a bathroom break. 

I tried to set off a smoke detector so we'd all have to leave the house, but by the time I came up with this idea and I found one of my dad's lighters, she was already setting the table. And to my horror, my nine year old sister was carrying our third generation antique gravy boat to the table, with my dildo sticking straight up, erect, if you will, in the sauce. 

I called my best friend and begged him to say I'd borrowed the ""sauce drizzler"" from him and he needed it back now, but by the time he stopped laughing and listened to my plea, my grandparents had already arrived. And we don't live in the kind of community where friends drop by unexpected, so if he came now it would arouse suspicion. 

**PART II**
The Dinner 

My grandparents had arrived and were hanging out in the TV room playing checkers with my little sister. The table was set and we were waiting to eat until my dad got back from work. So about this time he comes in the door and my mom furiously ushers everyone in to the dining room (alcove just off the TV room). 

I'm almost sweating through my shirt, my face is red, and I'm usually pretty quiet but out of nervousness I just couldn't shut up. My dad put his hand on my shoulder and I jumped out of nervousness. He said ""You ok 'athrowawayof_course'?"" I said ""Of course I am I'm always ok, everything's fine and I'm so lucky to have such a great family and pot roast is my favorite, but you knew that didn't you?"" He gave me a sideways look and sat down. We said grace (yep, we're religious, because that helps me so much in this situation) and my dad started to carve the roast for everyone. 

I'm practically unconscious from anxiety at this point and my leg is shaking which is noticeably shaking the table. My father says to my mother ""Pass the gravy down please?"" He picks up my dildo by the base, and starts to absentmindedly drizzle the gravy when he furrows his brown and slowly looks down at the ""gravy wand"" in his hand, at my pale pathetic shaking self, and at the ""drizzler"" again, and *collapses* laughing. Big heaving chuckles and guffaws. He's in tears laughing and holding his sides while everyone goes ""What, what's funny?!?!"" He gets up and says through rips of laughter ""Excuse me everyone, I have to go wash my hands."" But as he's turning to leave he says ""Dad, I know you're not a fan of gravy but this is a new recipe and you have to try it."" My mother is like ""It's not a new recipe it's the same brand I always buy--"" But my dad is already out of the room. 

So my grandpa says ""Don't be silly, I'll give it a try, 'my mothers name'."" But as my sister passes it down, my grandmother grabs it first, since she's sitting closer. She drizzles a heap of gravy on to her meat and passes it to my grandfather. He picks it up and takes a little gravy when he gets a full view of what exactly he's holding. My grandpa is an OG. He didn't even crack a smile. He just slid the dildo back in to the gravy and placed it calmly back on the table. He throws an arm across my grandmother and says ""No more dear, I think the meat's a tad underdone."" She says ""What? Tastes fine to me."" And goes for another bite. My grandpa snatches the fork out of her hand and proceeds to go dump both their plates in the trash. My mother is appalled they don't want her cooking and offers to throw it back in the oven. My grandfather said ""At our age, food poisoning is serious business, can't take the risk."" My grandmother was about to further protest when my grandpa inconspicuously pulls the dildo out of the gravy enough for my grandmother to recognize it (I don't want to know why she could). She quickly says ""You know, I wasn't all that hungry anyways."" 

So my grandpa isn't going to let me get away with this that easy. It takes maybe three minutes before he says to my mother ""This *jerked* chicken is delicious."" I choked on the green bean I'd been nibbling. My confused grandmother said ""Dear, it's a pot roast. Are you feeling alright?"" My grandpa says ""Never. Better. I'm just saying this particular pot roast reminds me of pulled *pork*. Maybe it's something in the gravy? Then my grandmother realized what he was doing and firmly says ""David, stop it."" My mother goes ""Everyone is being so strange tonight. What is going on?"" My Dad walks back in, face still red from laugh-crying. 

My grandfather cuts in ""So, 'athrowawayof_course' I hear you've been studying *long and hard* for finals."" My mother doesn't get it and says ""With college applications coming up, it's never been more important."" My grandpa: ""Oh yah, yah, I hear it can be really difficult to *penetrate* that *inner circle*."" My Dad excused himself again. Just as he was leaving the table, the doorbell rings. In between snorts he calls to my mother ""I've got it hun!"" 

He answers the door and it's my neighbor from a few houses down, who also happens to be my and my sister's piano teacher, so she knows our family pretty well. She's locked out and wants to wait for the locksmith inside our place since it's so cold outside. My mother offers to fix her a plate. She gratefully accepts and sits down. She's met my grandparents before at our recitals so they get to talking about politics or whatever when my mother offers her some gravy. My dad and grandfather simultaneously go ""No!"" And my dad cuts in ""It's spoiled."" My mother says ""Nonsense. They've been strange all night, don't mind them. Must be the cold weather."" 

So my neighbor/piano teacher/family friend clasps my dildo with both hands and begins drizzling the sauce over her meat. She stops and puts it back in the boat, then raises her eyebrows all the way up, and pushes her plate away. A few silent seconds of chewing go by when my neighbor says ""'my mother's name'?"" -- *pause* -- ""There's an artificial phallus in the gravy."" 

**PART 3** 
Aftermath 

So a few minutes after that my grandfather got up and thanked my mother for the most exciting meal he'd had since the war, and got the heck out of dodge. My father was trying to collect himself from laughter again, and my mother was multitasking between assuaging my piano teacher and my sister's questions about what an ""artificial phallus"" is. 

It is around that time my mother points at me and says ""Room. Now."" I'm just glad to have a reason to leave the table. 

About forty five minutes later my mother comes in to lecture me about boundaries and morals and hygiene. Informs me I'm grounded from now through all of winter break. She hands me back my toy, and says I'm not in trouble for owning it, I'm in trouble for ""bringing it to dinner."" 

She gets up to leave, but as she does, she turns to me and says one last thing. ""Son, I know at this age you'll experiment with your sexuality, but hear me when I say, you won't do it in the kitchen."" 

*TL;DR I put my dildo in the dishwasher and my mother mistook it for a serving utensil. She then used it to dispense gravy at a dinner with my little sister, grandparents, and piano teacher. Chaos ensued.*

PS: This happened last week but because of the dildo component I couldn't post it until the weekend. "
"TIFU by accidentally terrorising my town


So this happened when I was around 18 years old. I lived in a small town where nothing much happens and used to work in a fish and chip shop on the weekends (in the UK). I had a few hours to kill before starting before getting a call from my friend stating that she was upset and needed cheering up.

In my infinite wisdom I thought the perfect way to do this would be to dress up to make her laugh. So I learned this cool way of using a black t-shirt to tie around my face as a substitute for a ninja mask. I didn't have much else, so I threw on a black vest, jogging bottoms and a bath robe to complete the outfit. I also had a huge wooden katana (Tensa Zangetsu for those who know this). 

Outfit done! Time to go to her house. I walked there, we had a laugh and then it was time for me to work. On my way back I got some funny looks from the children, but they knew I was a ninja. 

I get changed for work and leave my house, only to find a police car slowly patrolling the area.  I get stopped and they ask me what house I lived at. I told them my real address and I receive a funny look. Then he asks if I had seen a man walking around with a balaclava and a blunt weapon originating from that house or ones nearby. 

Thinking on my feet I almost told them that my neighbours were crazy like that but ultimately just said, ""no?"" 
I looked quite innocent in my fish and chip uniform. 
Turns out there was a woman who lived nearby who thought I was some sort of lunatic and called the police.  
After work I walked home and heard all sorts of rumours of this masked maniac. 
""last I heard he was in the woods.""
""There's some crazy guy with an axe!""

I literally slipped right past them undetected. Seriously though, an axe? 

Thinking back on it now, it does look very suspicious to see a man in a bath robe walking around with a massive sword. 

For the remainder of the week I saw police cars all over town looking for me. Luckily it all died down in the end and I never dressed as a ninja again.

TL;DR: Friend was upset, I dressed as a ninja to cheer her up, accidentally terrorise town by making them think a masked lunatic was on the loose. Police patrolled the streets for a good week before giving up. "
"TIFU by wearing new panties to work.


This TIFU actually took place this last Tuesday. I was back at the office following a depressingly short holiday vacation. I overslept my alarm, so when I got up I was in full Tazmanian devil mode. In the process of frantically dressing, I snatched a new pair of panties off the top of my dresser. They had a little paper tag in the back, which I ripped off before yanking them on, throwing on the rest of my clothes, and rushing out the door.

Fast-forward a couple of hours.

I'm at work, where I am a first-year attorney at a big(ish) law firm. In other words, I am an absolute peon in terms of office politics. I walk around on eggshells just trying not to fuck anything up too badly, and I sleep with my volume turned all the way up so that if a partner emails me at 2:00 AM I can respond quickly. The firm culture is such that we constantly have slightly too many associates, who are all vying for work from the same people. Nobody has to give you work, and if you don't get work, you get fired. Thus, it's important to me that I present myself as someone who is competent, polished, and basically capable of making it through the day without making a complete fool of herself.

I show up to the office looking okay, but definitely not done-up. I have long hair, which (see above re: being in a hurry) I am wearing down. Today I'm meeting with some of the higher-ups to work through some motions for this huge case we're on. The team is basically me, one other associate, and four of the biggest partners at our firm.

An hour or so passes, and as we trudge along I become increasingly aware of an uncomfortable itch right above my butt crack. Now, I can't do anything about this, for obvious reasons, so it doesn't take long before it progresses from uncomfortable to unbearable. Pretty soon I'm shifting around in my seat trying to scratch my ass against the office chair, which, as you might imagine, is not super effective. I'm trying something--anything--I can think of to scratch this damn itch, but everything I try is just making it worse.

I don't realize that I look like an idiot until I catch one of the partners staring at me. At that point, he unceremoniously barks, ""Let's take a quick bathroom break,"" and gives me a conspiratorial nod.

I'm embarrassed, but I'm not about to correct him because I can scratch my ass in the bathroom. So I rush outta there and hurry over to the bathroom in our floor. I go into one of the stalls, pull down my pants, figure what the hell, I might as well pee while I'm in here, and try to figure out what's up.

It turns out that while I had removed the *paper* tag, I had failed to rip out that stupid plastic piece that holds the tag to the fabric. You know the one--it looks kind of like an H, with the plastic on both sides. That thing has been scratching my ass all morning. No wonder.

So now I'm in the stall, and I don't have a lot of options in terms of tag removal. I don't have any scissors or anything with me, and there's no way in hell I'm going back with this tag on my panties. So I sit back against the toilet, lean forward, and pull the panties towards my mouth to bite off the tag.

It takes a minute, but I finally get it. Success! Yay! No more tag on my panties, and I didn't even chip a tooth. I get up to flush and pull my pants up, and that's when I notice it: the hair on the front right side of my head is wet.

Oh my God.

OH. MY. GOD.

I don't know how I didn't realize it, but while I was trying to maneuver that stupid plastic thing into my mouth, I must have DIPPED. MY FUCKING. HAIR. IN. THE. TOILET. The one full of pee.

I rush out of the stall. Thankfully, nobody else was in the bathroom, because now I'm bent over the sink just frantically washing my hair in the bathroom sink with the hands-free soap dispenser. After a couple of minutes, I finish, and look up...and that's when I remember I have to get back into the meeting.

I have to walk back into a meeting in a room full of people I work for with my hair dripping wet and zero explanation.

For some reason I decide it won't be as bad if BOTH sides are wet, so I haphazardly soak the other half of my hair. I have no hair ties or bobby pins, both things that I normally would have brought, except that today I was in too much of a hurry.

Eventually I run out of ideas, so I just squeeze my hair out as best I can and walk back into the conference room. Several people look at my hair, but nobody asks about it. I offer no explanation. Nobody says a damn thing until we get up to leave. I gather all of my papers and notes and promise everyone that I'll get this all done as soon as I possibly can. I'm ducking out of the room and I hear one of the partners saying to another, ""I must be going crazy, because I thought her hair was dry when we sat down in here.""

TL;DR: I failed to remove a plastic tag on a new pair of panties. When I finally did so, I managed to dip my hair in pee-filled toilet water and then had to go out into a room full of my bosses and pretend like nothing happened.

"TIFU by working out too hard in the gym and getting served immediately by karma...ironic right?


So this happened a couple weeks ago, I was at my gym (which had just moved into a brand new location, new equipment, building etc.) and I was just starting what felt like a promising workout.

As a former college football player (24 years old) I'm what you might call injury prone, and have avoided bench press for the past few years and stick primarily to dumbbells for that good ole chest power. Cue fuck up #1 as I pick up the 100lb dumbbell from the bottom of the rack rather quickly, I bumped the one on the top rack, which happened to fall down behind the rack, and completely pulverize a massive new mirror in this brand new gym.

Luckily myself or no one else was hurt but as you can imagine this was quite embarrassing especially when the entire gym stopped to observe what had happened, being a large human (6'5 250lbs) I also felt like I was even more vulnerable in the crowd.

You know how they say when you break a mirror you get 7 years of bad luck? Well mine started immediately. Cue fuck up #2, after the staff closed off the area due to the shattered glass and things had cooled down I decided to continue my workout and give bench press a try with the dumbbells being closed off. As I said I was feeling quite good today so I worked my way up to a reasonable weight and began repping it  out.

Wow! This hasn't felt this easy in years I thought, until my 9th rep when I felt my pec muscle completely tear and curl up like window blinds being drawn up under my skin! It also didn't help that I was pinned by the weight and needed to call out for some assistance, not even 10 minutes after causing a massive scene breaking the mirror! 

I'm on my 4th day post surgery as I type this story with one hand! Hopefully the bad luck ended in the gym, happy New Years everyone!

TL;DR
Went to a new gym, shattered a massive mirror by accident, then tore my pectoralis major 10m later and am currently recovering from surgery! Karma hit me hard!

Edit; spelling
No I did not need a spotter I was repping out 225lbs, 9th rep when it tore unexpectedly as I was moving the weight quite easily. Also yes I warmed up with 1 set 135lbs, set 2 185lbs, set 3 205lbs all for 10 reps

"TIFU by getting half my high school suspended


This was 1997 at a prep private school.  Both 10th and 11th grade shared a very pregnant English teacher.  One assignment involved both grades which involved all of us reading the book ""The Scarlet Letter.""  

Each class had a different assignment and, as a perk, it was arranged so both classes got to watch the movie together in one big room, split into a Thursday and Friday class period.  The English teacher would be supervising on Thursday, but had a last-minute appointment to meet with her OBGYN (preggo doc) on Friday.  She couldn't arrange for a sub for Friday, so she told us the Biology teacher would be checking in on us from time to time.

On Thursday, we started watching the movie.  We were expecting the one with Demi Moore.  Nope!  It was some older version.  So at the next free period, I floated the idea to a couple of friends about switching the movie on Friday to anything I could find at the public library on my bike ride home.  I don't think they thought I was serious, but I stopped at the library anyway.  The only thing I could find was ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights.""  It'll do.  I presented my loot to my friends the next morning at PE and it became our collective mission to convince the entire two classes to allow us to do it.  We did a good job too as we convinced nearly all of the class, INCLUDING the son of the owner of the school (he was easy), but still had to work on 3 goodie-goodie girls.  They were tough, but all of the class (peer pressure) wore them down. 

The biology teacher got the movie started right where it left off (VHS).  She gave us the evil eye to be good and left us alone so she could go teach her class.  We were now alone and all eyes were on me.  It was such a thrill to make the switch.  I will say this.. that movie is funny.  But when you are NOT supposed to be watching it.. it's HYSTERICAL.  We were having a good time and the biology teacher even walked back in to check on us.  Luckily, it was one of those serious medieval scenes.  She scanned the class and walked back out.  Close call since that movie is full of jokes.

The class period was all but over when the biology teacher returned, precisely at a joke scene (I think the ""lend me your ears"" scene).  She lightly scolded us, but switched the movie back.  The class ended moments later.  We laughed it off and enjoyed the rest of the day and weekend.

Monday came around and we all but forgot about the movie switch.  The headmaster was waiting for us in the class.  That was not unusual as he often invited us to do trash pickup or something.  Not this time.  He went into a long speech on how he was disappointed with all of us... but just when it was over, he surprised us all by saying that since no one ratted us out, that ALL of the 10th and 11th grades would be suspended for a single day.  ""All tests, quizes and assignments due for Tuesday, will now all have 0's"".  The goodie-goodie girls were in tears.  It didn't really matter, because all tests, quizes and assignments were postponed since no one was at school that Tuesday.  A letter was sent home with every student.  The letter never singled me out.. it just said ""a student"" had brought the video.  Another letter was put in our ""permanent record.""  

When my mom read this letter, she laughed, rolled her eyes and tossed it aside.  I laughed with her.  She then asked who brought the video, and I laughingly said it was me, like she would give me a high five or something.  Wrong.  She went from laughing to full-on anger in a heartbeat.  

I later heard it called ""The suspension of '97"".  When I was at college, I bumped into one of those goodie-goodie girls at a bus stop.  We sat and chatted for a bit and I brought up the suspension.  She stopped talking, gave me a neutral face, stood up and walked away.  Yikes.  

**

TL;DR: Switched out video during class and since no one ratted us out, the 10th and 11th grades all got suspended for one day.

UPDATE
Didn't expect this to gather so much attention.  I made some edits and grammar fixes after re-reading.  I saw a few comments saying this story is BS.  I don't blame you.. I also wouldn't believe it had I read it.  It did happen and, at the time, I can say I did feel pretty rotten about convincing those goodie-goodies who really didn't want any part of it.  They did laugh with the movie, so... Also, the teachers all kind of gave the impression that it was an excessive punishment and, I think for that reason is why they postponed the tests/quizes/assignments.  I left to dual-enroll at a community college the next year and didn't even know anyone thought fondly of it until I heard someone mention (years later) that the class (then seniors) called it the ""Suspension of '97"".  I felt like a proud father at that moment and bragged ever since.  Also, sorry for it being 20 years later.  Reddit wasn't around at that time and, after seeing many throwbacks, thought it would be fun to throw this one in.  I'm now married and a new dad and felt that sharing this story would give me warm feels.  It did.  Thanks Reddit for that.  :)"
"TIFU by being a keen student.


(Using a throwaway because I have friends who know my Reddit username but don't know this story.)

This TIFU happened when I was 15, when I was a sophomore in high school.

We were just getting into that intense time of year when exams are coming up, and report cards stop feeling like a dim and distant nightmare and start feeling like a real and waking nightmare. I was one of those dicks that sat at the front of every class and used up a small forest's worth of notepaper every semester. I sure as hell didn't get any girls, but I liked getting As.

Anyway, at some point deep into the semester, I got a bit of a cough. Got the whole deal with the swollen lymph nodes and the streaming eyes and nose, but was I going to miss any classes? Not a fucking chance. So a few weeks later, when I noticed I still had a bit of a lump under my jaw, I didn't really pay any attention to it. The lump got a bit bigger, but I figured it was one of those things that had to get worse before it got better, so I ignored it. It was only when it started to get kinda painful and actually big enough to be visible that I started to wonder if I should maybe, possibly think about seeing a doctor.

Did I see a doctor? No. I did not. I had algebra that wasn't going to solve itself.

I forced myself through weeks of school, until vacation finally rolled around, and it was a bit more convenient to go for a doctor's appointment. And, because I'm posting this in r/tifu, you've probably already guessed that they didn't just send me home with some Tylenol and an ""I've been brave"" sticker.

Turned out I had lymphoma, and in the time I'd been sitting in classes, it had worked its way right up to stage IV, and I had cancer cells settling into their cozy new homes in lymph nodes all over my body and in my liver. Lucky for me, it was a very curable form, and after the better part of a year of chemo, radiotherapy and emotional breakdowns, I was good to go. But sometimes I wonder if the treatment would have been easier if I'd gone to a doctor sooner, or what would've happened to me if I'd left it that bit longer or happened to have a more aggressive form of cancer.

So I decided to share this story. Because I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through if they can help it; and even though I was lucky, catching this kind of thing early can be the difference between living and dying. If you're reading this: sure, push yourself hard and achieve the things you want to achieve, but please don't push yourself so hard that you break.

tl;dr: Ignored a lump because I didn't want to miss classes, turned out it was lymphoma and it got to stage IV before I bothered to go see a doctor."
"TIFU by burning a hole in my leg for the THIRD time


Turns out I'm a bloody idiot.  Or a slow learner.  Bit of both, really.

I have spent 6 weeks healing a mysterious injury on my shin - I hadn't noticed walking into anything, I could only assume I'd been bitten by something in the night.  It had been cold weather, maybe some rogue poisonous spider was seeking shelter and I'd upset it by moving.  Seemed hugely unlikely as I don't live in Australia, anyway it had a lot of necrosis and wound up being an open injury about the size of a 10p/quarter.  It's mostly healed, but has another couple of weeks to go TBH.  Quite a wound.

4 weeks ago I incurred another (less severe) injury, same lower leg, thankfully it cleared in a fortnight.

Last night I got another one - this time on the foot of the same leg.  Pretty confidently ruling out bites now as this is still an angry red pre-blister.  And really hot...

6 weeks ago it was cold, I used a hand warmer to walk home.  4 weeks ago, similarly.  Last night again.  Finally I put 2 and 2 together.  The hand warmer I use is a Zippo naptha-based catalysing one.  

It sits in a little velvet bag, and is barely warm enough to warm a cold hand, so after the walk I'd throw it in the bed to take off some of the chill.  The design of the warmer is that you fill it with petrol, and 'light' it against a platinum catalyst - the catalyst heats up and vaporises more fuel, which is further catalysed in turn.  In normal usage it's constantly cooled by ambient circumstances, but in the bed it was insulated enough to keep heating up to maybe 60C - not normally any kind of risk, but if you're deeply asleep on your left side with warm feet for the first time in a day, it's possible to selectively cook yourself.  I did.

At least I'm not blaming spiders any more, I'm just an idiot misusing a runaway catalytic reaction.  And looking at my foot, and seeing the size of the cooked area, I'm looking at the end of Feb at least before I can claim to be restored."

"TIFU by winning an argument


I recently got a driver's license and I usually end up having to drive my friends around because I'm the first in my group of friends to get a licence. The problem is the friend I usually end up driving around is a major backseat driver so naturally, we spend most of the time arguing about driving rules and why I'm in the driver's seat and not him. Today I stopped at a stop sign (which you're meant to do) and it turned into a massive argument because he said a rolling stop is just as legit as a regular stop. So when I went to drop him off at his house instead of stopping in front of his house I drove by it really slowly and told him that it's a rolling stop bro, same as a regular stop so just hop out? At that point both of us didn't want to lose the argument and I was going like 10mph and he decides he's just gonna jump out of the car to prove his point. Long story short, he rolled his ankle and was too proud to let me take him to the hospital. It didn't look too bad but he limped all the way to his doorstep and almost passed out trying to get up the steps. Now I'm on reddit because I feel really bad about it.
