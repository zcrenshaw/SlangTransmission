"TIFU by losing a customers baby photos.


To clarify, I work in a phone retailer in the UK where it's common to do a data transfer for customers buying a new phone from their old one. 

A young couple had come in, toddler in tow, to get their new device and had been incredibly helpful by loading all their data on to a micro SD card ready for the new device. Despite them offering to do it at home, part of our good service guidelines is to do it in store for them. Some may know that many phones spring load their micro SD cards so that pushing it in to the device pops it back out.

This phone, for whatever reason, had a ridiculously powerful spring that immediately shot the SD card out at such a force I didn't even see it go. So I'm standing there with no card, no knowledge and in store music drowning out any sound of where it landed. 

I searched, my colleagues searched, but to no avail. These photos were majority baby photos documenting this kids entire life and had helpfully been backed up on to one card with no other options. No Dropbox style backups, no PC backups, nothing but that card. The customer was understanding but incredibly upset and when store closed I promised to stay behind and look before the cleaners descended. 

This was two months ago. No sign.

This week we had keyboard issues. Four buttons weren't working. It's likely to be a blockage as keyboards tend to work fully or not at all. As I prised the buttons off it became rapidly more obvious that black plastic was blocking it. Sure enough, an SD card. Tested it and there's the couple, there's the kid, everything. In two months we have thousands of customers so I had no way to contact them but to search archive upon archive of paperwork to try and find them. 

To cut a long story short, I did. I rang, returned and apologised for the heartache and they couldn't be happier. I pride myself on my service and it had bothered me for months. 

TLDR I lost a customers baby photos for two months and hunted them down to return it. Now I can sleep at night. "

"TIFU by befriending an Uber driver


So of course this didn't happen today, but last Friday. I decided that I wanted to have a couple drinks and have a good time on Friday, but I do not know what moderation is. After drowning my body with almost a liter of overpriced gin I was ready to go downtown. Drinking that much alcohol in a short amount of time really fucked with me (go figure) and I only lasted about an hour at the bars. 
Que the uber ride home. At this point I was blacked out so I have no recollection of the roughly 10 minute ride home. According to my girlfriend, I had struck up a conversation with this man about how I was a world class golf coach and play a couple of Pro-Am tournaments every month.Now spoiler alert,  I know absolutely nothing about golf. Not shit. So my uber driver, let's call him Jim, is buying the whole thing. He asks if I could knock a few strokes off of his game and get him in touch with the president of the local country club. I tell Jim of course and I can also get him this guy's number because I play a few rounds with him every weekend. I let him now I'd help him out in any way possible to get his golf game back on track. 
I realize now that that may have been a giant mistake. I wake up the next morning still slightly drunk and my girlfriend asks if I remember talking to the uber driver last night. I say no and think nothing of it. She gives me the rundown and I just laugh it off.
 About four hours later I'm at work and one of my coworkers was like hey, someone wants to talk to you. I finish with a customer and go see what this guy wants. It struck me as a bit odd when he addresses me by name but eh, whatever. He asks if I got him some guys phone number and I had to explain to him that I had no idea who he, or the guy who's phone number he wants is. And this is when he tells me that he is Jim, my uber driver. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I have to crush this nice old man's dreams now and tell him I know absolutely nothing about golf. I try my best to tell him that I cannot help him in any way and try to explain that I was bullshitting the whole conversation. Jim doesn't take too well to this and just walks off while mumbling under his breath ""I guess that's just how the world works sometimes."" Way to make me feel bad, Jim.

Tl;dr: Got intoxicated and turned into a pro golfer who gives empty promises about golf lessons and fancy memberships."
"TIFU by putting ant poison on a hornets nest


For once someone actually posts on the day of their fuck up because it actually happen like 5 hours ago. So I live in a secluded part of an already small town, just under a mile from Illinois's second largest forest preserve. Needless to say living in basically in an acre of forest has lots of bugs. The bugs like to get down in the cracked foundation and build nests and colonize down there and sure enough we have a Carpenter ant infestation.  I took this hose and big bottle of ant poison and just let it drain down there.  As I see all these ants running/dying/panicking like it's the smite of Soddam and Gomorrah, I see this wasp fly into a little hole on my siding.  I figure while I'm at it,  I'll poison them too.  I get up on my roof and find this hole and start going to town with the poison.  These were wasps,  not bees,  not hornets,  wasps.  These fuckers get angry.  They do not pollinate flowers,  they do not produce honey.  They literally exist to fuck shit up.  They sting more than once. They give off a chemical that alerts other wasps that they're in danger and need back up when they sting or die. This is where I fucked up. The poison is only used for ants roaches and spiders. This poison only made them angry. I pull out the hose out of this hole and a steady stream of furious wasps come pouring out like the final scene from Braveheart only with wasps and King Edward's army was my exposed skin.  (On a side note, it's 95 degrees in the end of June and I'm on a black tar roof. Of course I have no shirt on.) This is bad.  I'm swatting and getting stung like crazy. I'm on a roof so I can't get too crazy or I might fall off.  I make like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs and get out of there as fast as I could. As I was on the ladder,  one of the wasps gets me right in the eye.  I'm freaking out. Now I can't see so I jump half way off the ladder. Have you felt your internal organs shift?  Well I did today.  I land and feel my guts move up in my body but my knees and ankles and hips take the impact. I land in a rose bush.  I'm dazed and confused,  on the ground, scraped up, sore, blinded and getting stung by bees.  I finally make it into my house and am currently in a tub of ice water applying ointment to my stings.  
TL;DR: Tried to kill a wasp infestation on my roof with ant poison, WHICH FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY DOES NOT WORK!  SPECIFICALLY GET WASP KILLER, got attacked, jumped half way off a ladder into a rose bush (shirtless) and am currently nursing my wounds...  and pride.

Edit 1: spelling, grammar (as usual) and wording on what constitutes a bee.


Edit 2: Holy Shit this post blew up, I guess it really is funny when someone else gets hurt."
"TIFU by taking my entire hotel's internet down for a day


Alright, so this happened Monday. I was staying at a hotel with my brother for a few days while he was in LA for a conference...

**Context:** 

We both brought our desktops (my brother was streaming, and I wanted to browse dank memes), but neither of us had wireless adapters. I called ahead and found out the hotel only had a single network jack in each room - no problem, I figured: I'll just grab one of my extra routers I have laying around and wire us both up through that.

I grab a random router that a friend had given to me - I'd never used before, but since it was the first one I saw I just grabbed it.

-

So this is where the fuck up happens: we get everything set up, I plug in the router, and only my brother's computer is getting internet through the router.

No problem, I figure. I'll just log onto the router and fix that.

Now, anyone that's worked with many home routers before knows they generally use some variation of 192.168.0.1 as their logon address.

My main router is just that address, so that's the first one I tried plugging into the address bar (you can probably see where this is going) well, up comes the login screen, and I try to guess the username and password (remember, never used this router before, and it was a random Chinese brand, so I wasn't familiar with the setup page or the login it used):

&gt;Username: admin

&gt;Password: ~~admin~~ password

And I'm in. Great, going smoothly so far. I start changing settings... But for some reason nothing's happening. Then, in a move of desperation, I start changing any settings I can...

-

Suddenly, everything's down. My phone is no longer able to browse while on WiFi - I pull out my laptop, same thing. I call down to the front desk and ask if their internet is working... NOPE.

They also couldn't accept payments because of this, so I just fucked them over big time. Everyone else in the hotel can't use the internet to get work done.

It was down for about 6 hours. When it finally came back up, hardwired still didn't work. 

So yeah, that was about my greatest unintentional hack ever.

-

**TL;DR** - hotel didn't change the default username/pass on their ISP box, I accidentally logged on thinking it was my own router and ended up disabling the entire hotel's internet access for half a day

EDIT: To the people calling BS... You can believe it or not. I got nothing to gain by posting this... I just thought it was a funny story you'd all enjoy hearing, and could help some people change their default logins. If you don't think it's real, that's fine, but sometimes just because something is unusual, doesn't make it fake.

EDIT2: And to everyone who thinks I didn't actually take my desktop... https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4p4w1c/staying_at_a_hotel_for_a_few_days_too_much/

Also, here's the router's setup page, showing how I ended up having it set up: http://i.imgur.com/46OqRWF.jpg"
"TIFU by hooking up with a girl and having the worst walk of shame of my life


So this story happened a while ago, but when I told it to a friend of mine he urged me to post it here. So here goes..

I was at a party in a flat where only students live and at a certain time I was getting pretty intoxicated. I’m not quite sure how it started, but at some point I was making out with this girl, let’s call her Emily, who lived on the same floor the party was at. We wanted some more privacy and thus she was dragging me to her room, which had been seen by some other girls. I think for the story it’s good to know that most people knew each other at this party. The girls who saw us were friends of Emily and they all had another friend who I had hooked up with a while before this party. Anyway, we entered the bedroom, locked the door and things were progressing to the point where we were no longer wearing clothes. The girls who spotted us thought Emily couldn’t do this to their mutual friend and they were banging on the bedroom door. We were pretty drunk and the banging on the door, combined with screaming was kind of disturbing. In fact, Emily thought she could convince her friends that I was not in her room, so that they would leave and we could continue. She quickly put some clothes on, but obviously I had to hide and the only place our drunk minds could think of was her closet. So while she was telling her friends to leave, I was hiding in the closet. I honestly believe they could still see my clothes on the floor though.

They soon left though and we were able to continue. About 10 minutes later, I think, they were back and we were getting annoyed. Once again she opened the door to tell them to leave. This time I just hid under the blankets; she asked me to. They obviously knew Emily wasn’t alone, but she thought she would just say it was someone else who was with her. The girls actually came in the room and I heard them talking right beside me. One person actually sat down on the bed, but that might have been Emily as well, I never found out. I was just not giving a fuck (literally) and waiting for them to finally leave, which they eventually did.

 However, this is when shit got weird.. Before we went to sleep, I had to pee. Emily didn’t want me to go to the toilet, because then her friends would see me coming out of her bedroom. She suggested I used some sort of bucket she had in her room. So, I was peeing in a bucket in her bedroom, which was really strange to me. I remember thinking, why am I even doing this? I was honestly happy that I could sleep after that. In the middle of the night I woke up, when I noticed she was moving around. I was half asleep and not really sure if I was seeing things right, but it seemed as if she was peeing next to the bed. I’m not sure if she realised it, or maybe she thought the bucket was there or something. All I know is that she was still very drunk and I just fell back asleep. And then the morning sun rose and we were both waking up. I just wanted to go home asap and got out of bed to search for my clothes. And then I saw them lying next to the bed, on her side. I remembered waking up in the middle of the night, but I was hoping I had it all wrong. I did not. I picked up my clothes and they were wet. My jeans, shirt and vest had been freaking pissed on. The only thing I thought of was the fact that I had to cycle home for about 20 minutes, and I could not do that in my underwear only. So I just sucked it up, put on my pissed on clothes, cycled home and showered for about an hour while thinking: what the hell happened? Emily and I never spoke of the pissed on clothes. I think she was too drunk to remember and I just found it way too awkward to tell her.

TL;DR, Got drunk and hooked up. She pissed all over my clothes, had to go home wearing them. NEVER FELT SO DIRTY

EDIT: Okay so people seem to think the vest is weird. I'm also not sure if vest is the correct word, maybe its a cardigan. At least this is what it looks like: http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Cardigan-In-Teal-Green-Cotton/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6359938&amp;cid=7617&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=36&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Teal&amp;totalstyles=462&amp;gridsize=3 "
"TIFU By finishing my PhD.


So this happened last December, but it still is going on (please excuse my English, it is not my native language [or area]).

So I was a high school teacher and decided to pursue a PhD, got accepted in several universities, went for the one with the best funding I could get as an international student (benefits + tuition remission + about 10k a year). I meet my now husband (American), and I teach every day, get wonderful evaluations, write my dissertation, attend conferences, publish a couple of articles, write a book on the side. Happy times, tough I work between 60 to 70 hours a week. 8 years pass.

I am finally ready with my dissertation completed, defended, 4 interviews lined up in January. 

I deposit my dissertation, get my PhD, get the gown and do the whole commencement thing, my family comes, claps, and glows.

Went to the interviews, spent close to $2000 but hey, it is an investment, no?

No. Here comes reality...

I did not get a campus visit, so now I am unemployed, no healthcare, no bus pass, no student discount, no income, no access to libraries, journals, books, computers, software, technology, conferences. Each application costs me about $64 and hours of my time to get it ready. 

Most universities are only hiring adjuncts or students, basically having a PhD disqualifies you for a job.

I kind of get an adjunct position in a town nearby, they offer me $2000 for the whole semester and 2 courses, no benefits. I can't even pay the gas to go to work and if I work, I would lose the Obamacare and have to get insurance, which I will not be able to pay. I have to decline, I can't afford to have a job.

I apply back to high schools, no one will hire me because I have a PhD and they do not have the budget. I apply for a AP grader position, no, I have been too long out of the High School system to meet criteria.

I fucked up, reddit, I just wanted to teach.

**TL;DR** If you are doing a PhD, don't finish it. If you finish it, apply for another one. The only time you will be in Academia is if you are a student.

**Edit:** Well, I certainly did not expect this to get so big. I just woke up today to another ""dear applicant"" email and wanted to vent.

To answer a few questions: Yes, of course my PhD is in the humanities.

I finished in 8 years, it is below the average in the humanities (at least at my ex-university).

I also applied to public highschools, and you do not negotiate the salary, and they do not have the budget to hire expensive PhDs.

I can teach something other than Span 101, I have taught several courses that I have designed myself (not only grammar).

**Important** Do not take my advise, finish your dissertation, finish your PhD, etc.

And, I am no longer in Obamacare, that was one month and apparently I was clearly misguided, I am now in my husband's insurance. I will do more research before claiming again that statement, however, still, $2000 for 2 classes is shit.

And thank you for all the great suggestions, encouragements, and all of that. Not so many thanks to all the insults, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , what can I do?

To all the PhD's who have landed jobs, congratulations, please unionize with the adjuncts and graduate student workers and fix the system. Perhaps you can."
"TIFU by crying in front of some strangers.


I had to put my dog/best friend of 14 years down a month ago.  To say it was traumatic is an understatement.  He was ornery, barked at everyone, peed on everything, and absolutely hates my husband's feet.  But he was loyal to me and I had him since he was a pup so I put up with him.

So today I was at work, I do scheduling and insurance authorizations for an outpatient diagnostic imaging department at a hospital, and I heard some heavy breathing behind me as I was walking to the cafeteria.  

I turned around and it was two Bernese Mountain dogs.  The hospital volunteers have therapy dogs that make the rounds and offer support with pet/touch therapy.  Me being the dog lover that I am I ask if I can give them some belly rubs.

And I immediately start bawling my eyes out!  I'm a 34 year old Army Vet for goodness sake and I can't keep it together long enough to give tummy rubs!  The two volunteers are absolutely stunned.  They just looked at each other in total bewilderment while I'm on my knees in the middle of a hospital walkway with patients and hospital staff passing me by and I'm clutching onto this giant dog saying ""I'm so sorry"" in between sobs.

The volunteers start fumbling for words ""Can we call someone for you?""  ""What department do you work in?""  ""Do you know this woman?""

I sense that I'm drawing a crowd and get off the floor while muttering apologies and run to the nearest elevator.  Everyone just stands there, exchanging looks like they can't believe what they just witnessed.  Needless to say I won't be going to the cafeteria anytime soon.

TL;DR Had to put my dog down, lost my sh*! Over a therapy dog, and scared the bejesus out of their handlers and a crowd of people.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

**UPDATE**

So I went to bed after reading a few comments thinking how nice it is to know I'm not the only one who's made a fool of themselves in public over a fur baby.  I figured I'd get a few more upvotes, a troll would eventually call me out for my service (honestly not much service, went to a bunch of schools, broke my ankle on a 15k road march and got discharged), and that would be the end of it.

Now I'm at work with my brand new Game of Thrones lunch bag - Winter is coming?  Oh heck no, Winter is HERE! - and HOLY COW!!!  I never expected this kind of response.  I can't stop smiling knowing this has touched others.  You guys have bolstered my courage enough that I'm going to stop by the volunteer auxiliary desk and try to explain what happened.  

Also, my husband is taking me to a local humane society shelter today after work to see some pups.  He knows full and well that I may have another outburst but at least I'll know it's coming.  If we find a bond with a dog then we'll adopt.  If we don't then we're going to sponsor one and cover their adoption fee.  We also plan to sponsor one dog a month in memory of my little guy.

Thanks again to everyone!

"TIFU and broke my wife's face


So today we find roach droppings on the counter top of our new apartment. (I posted about the terrible decision of selecting this place the other day on tifu but it was removed.) 


I decide to check the tops of the cabinets as they may be home to these bastards. I climb on top of the counters by the sink to take a look, and everything is good just a bit of dust but no droppings. Well my kitchen is like a rectangular shape and in order to check the other cabinet tops I need to get around the stove and the stove hood... 

At this point I have two options I can try and walk around the stove or I can get down and climb up on the other side. My lazy butt decides to just try and wiggle to the other side.

I go to step around the stove and my stomach hits the corner of the over hood. I lose my balance and I am falling with my neck aimed right for the countertop corner. In my head I am thinking I am going to die, all because I was too lazy and too fat to get down and climb back up.

That is when my wife comes and saves my life! She tackles me as I am falling and catches my 250 lbs butt with her shoulder and face. She tilts me so that I fall with her to the floor instead of breaking my neck on the countertop. I scratched my arm on the fall and twisted my leg, but she took the most damage as her face is swollen and she has a black eye.


Tldr: forced my wife to save my life and it broke her face.

"TIFU by playing *Bad Boys* during a traffic stop


This morning I was driving to work in a happy mood since it is pay day.  I was in a rush and was pulled over for speeding in a zone that was being prepared for construction.  Thinking I could lighten the mood, I remembered Gabriel Iglesias' special and threw on *Bad Boys*.  The officer came up to the car, and the first thing out of his mouth was, ""so you think you're funny, huh?"" (In a very humorous tone I might add) .  I completely misread that, thinking he's seen the comedy special, and responded with a sarcastic yes (more like a flamboyant ""absolutely"").  The cop takes my info and comes back with a max fine ticket, and tells me to get on my way.  

TL;DR Played *Bad Boys* to a cop during a traffic stop and basically negated payday with my new ticket.

*MEGA EDIT: Since some people aren't understanding this all correctly, I will explain some more. I get that I was in the wrong, I'm not fighting to get the ticket off completely, I'm fighting to have the ticket reduced from a double fine. The ""construction zone"" rule should not have been enforced because it was not in the time parameter. Yes, I should be fined $150 for speeding, I am fine with that. No, he should not have issued me a $300 ticket for speeding in a construction zone. I called the police headquarters and just got out of a meeting with the sheriff and my cousin (who is an officer in the same department) and they agree with me, the evidence is on my side. I don't hate construction workers and I was not trying to be an ass, I was going the flow of traffic.  This argument is taking away from the original intent of the post, and yes, he did appreciate the song after the fact, but me playing the song took me from a warning to a ticket as well ($25 infraction for the song)*

**Wow front page! Guess it was worth it to get ticketed 😂**"
"TIFU NSFW by touching a table saw blade.


I was working in my shop making a cut I've made 100's of times. I f'ed up by using a dull blade and putting my hand over the blade when making the cut. 

So I was making a groove cut with a 1/4"" wide dado blade that was 1/2"" above the table. Cutting a groove on a 1"" wide board. Push stick in my right hand. None in my left. My left hand was guiding the front of the board.  Near the middle of the cut, the board kicked back and my finger dropped onto the blade. 

Could have been prevented if I followed my own safety rules about not putting my hand over top of the blade. Also could have been prevented if I had a SawStop table saw. 

My wound is 1/4"" wide and 3/8""-1/2"" deep in the left side of my middle finger between the first and second knuckle. Bone is exposed. Doctor and hand surgeon seems to think it will heal fine. We shall see. [The Wound](https://imgur.com/gallery/7waLK) "

"TIFU by missing two airplanes on the same day...with my girlfriend.


This has to be the most embarrasing fuck up of my life and certainly most expensive one. Girlfriend and I both just want to crawl under a blanket because of this fiasco and not come out, ever.


So the story starts with me and my girlfriend, who lives in Russia. I came here to see her and we were supposed to fly from Moscow to the other side of Russia to meet her relatives. Unfortunately there's a ton of other tickets we were supposed to manage and we noticed (too late) that we had bought tickets to 24th of June at 0:05, instead of at 23:55. We were both under impression that the tickets were very late on 24th. We were bying them over skype one late evening and apparently both of us were too tired to properly double check, while thinking the other one of us did. Surprise: we didn't.



That's TIFU #1. Here comes the second one. We got upset that we had missed our flight, so we decided to buy new tickets. We decided on getting them for this night since we already had all our stuff packed. Unfortunately, we had some trouble with bank cards and had extra hassle with that. Time was lost, and we got into a hurry purchasing new tickets. We bought tickets, took our stuff and headed to the airport. Afraid we'd be late we took a train, more expensive, but at least more certain. Arrived to airport, stood in line to register on the flight and give in our luggage. Then we hear we're not on the passanger list. We thought it could be because we bought the tickets so late, so we went to ticket office and then we find out that in our hurry we bought the wrong tickets. Somehow the online ticket software easily switches the month and we didn't notice. So now we were stuck on an airport at midnight with no easy way out of there and with this ticket fiasco. We exhanged the tickets for tomorrow, but that wasn't cheap: cost us about 300€ to get the new tickets.


We were then at the airport informing our relatives of our screw up. They too lost their night sleep over our mess up. We got back to our apartments only at 6am. It was a long bus drive with a cursing drunkard. Being very tired and miserable we decided to share this embarrasement with the rest of the world.


Tl;dr: Bought tickets for the wrong time. Tried to get back on schedule by buying other tickets, but purchased them for wrong time again. 

   
**Edit:** Whoa! We weren't expecting to get this many replies. Thank you for comments and encouraging words you guys! Lots of interesting stories. We are back at the airport again, so no time to reply back for a while. 


Btw: some of you are serious grammar-natzies and what's with all the relationship advice? Also, NO, she's not a mail order bride!


**Edit2:** We got safely where we were supposed to get. Internet is something of a scarcity in here. We've gotten at least partly over our goof-ups and are doing well - trying to enjoy a chilly siberian summer day. Thanks again for replies! ^^"
