"TIFU by letting a guy use my bathroom during our garage sale


Happened over the summer.

So, we're in the process of moving and I figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and I have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. Last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. Considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, I took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. Midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn't think he'd be able to make it home. Now, my wife and I had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be NO BATHROOM for customers. However, I had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. I also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we'd all be fat, dumb, and happy. But I'm not a complete idiot. I told him he'd better check with The Boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. He chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, I see him leaving. I figured all is well.
A few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. I assumed it was because I shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said ""no"". I couldn't be more wrong. Apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. He tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. He simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. He. Blamed. My. Dog."
"TIFU by not locking my door at night.


OK so about an hour ago I was woken up by my girlfriend who was adamant the cat was acting wierd. It's almost 3 in the morning so I'm all for ignoring it and going back to sleep but nope she want me to go see if he's been sick somewhere.

Alright fine I'll humour the damn cat and go see what he wants 

The second I walk out into the hall I know something isn't right and then I spot it....just to my left the door handle is about halfway down and the door is about to open or shut and I have no idea which.

Now I'm not a physically intimidating guy by any stretch of the imagination but my girlfriend and yoing child are inside so I'm not waiting to see what's on the other side of that door. I wedge my foot as hard as I can against the bottom of the door pull the handle up and twist the key all in one motion but by the time I'm looking out the peep whole they are gone. 
I hear who ever it was run out into the street at top speed. (Thank God) 

But now a new problem, we're they going out or coming in? 

The first one is fine I stopped them getting in and no one got hurt and they have now ran away at top speed. 

The second one though.....this has me worried that they weren't alone.

I start to search the flat....no one seems to be here. good thank fuck, honestly I wasn't thinking about what might happen if I found someone. 

I go to our bedroom and let my girlfriend know everything is OK but someone tried to get in..

I call the police and they take a few details and ask if everything is OK. I let them know no one is here and that they didn't get in. 

About 15 mins go by, the whole time I'm shaking and checking all the rooms over and over, then i get a phone call good news they caught them.....yup them two of them and they ask a question that get my heart going again. 

Are you missing a wallet?.... I don't think so I'm sure they weren't even inside. But I don't know for sure 

Sure enough I check my coat pocket that's in the living room at the opposite end of the flat from the front door and it's gone. They were inside and not only that they had gone through my jacket and God knows what else. 

The police arrive shortly after to give me my wallet back and take a statement. Apparently these guy were off there face on drugs but managed to mission impossible through my flat without making a sound. They were caught on cctv trying to get into parked cars in the area. 

Thank God the cat was acting shifty he's getting to sleep in the bed tonight. 

Lesson of the day CHECK YOU DOOR AT NIGHT. 
Don't take it for granted that someone else locked it.
 

TLDR: didn't check the door and two drugged up ""youths"" got into my flat stole my wallet and almost got away with it. If it hadn't been for that pesky cat. "

"TIFU by tipping in the tip jar.


Very minor fuck up, but I thought I'd share it anyway. 

First off, I'm in Australia, and tipping isn't a thing here. But some local businesses will have a tip jar on the counter. I was at this bakery which I frequent a lot, and I'll tip some of the coins in change I get back in the jar. Today however, I get my $5.50 change back - in a note and a 50c coin - and go to drop the coin in the jar. Instead I drop both the coin and the note in. I needed that $5 for a bus to get back home. I didn't want to be the guy who reached into the tip jar with the cashier right in front of me to get my money back, so I just left. I walked for 30 minutes instead of a 10 minutes bus drive."

"TIFU: A Reptile Dysfunction


Happened a few years ago. Every word is true. Wish it wasn't.

At the time, I had a good-sized Florida kingsnake named Gumbo. She was about four and a half feet long, about as thick as a broomstick. Despite her size and fierce looks, she was tame as a puppy. Even though she was as friendly as a snake can be, I had rules about when I'd handle her. If she'd eaten within the last day or two, the movement of being handled would make her poop. And snake shit is some NASTY stuff. On the other hand, if it had been a while since her last feeding, she would be really fidgety and squirm around, looking for food.

Luckily, on this particular Monday evening, it was prime Gumbo snuggle time. She had eaten on Friday, pooped over the weekend, and wouldn't eat again for a week. I grabbed her from her aquarium and plopped down on the couch to watch a few episodes of Futurama on the Netflix. My then-wife (now ex) sat on the other couch, doing her school work. But Gumbo was being a pain in the ass. She kept trying to get away. Over my shoulders, behind the couch, in between the cushions (ever had to pry a struggling snake from the recesses of your couch?), into my shirt, back out the collar... I spent most of an episode trying to get this little lady to chill out. I would've put her away, but I'll admit, this was back when I used to smoke pot and I was feeling pretty lazy at that moment.

Finally we reached a very uneasy settlement-- she curled up and stayed put just inside the left leg of my shorts. Now, I wasn't a fan of this idea. But I was feeling kind of lazy, and she was finally holding still, and I had just started wearing briefs instead of boxers. The elastic band around my thigh would keep her away from my junk if she tried getting frisky. I watched my show in peace. Until she moved north. I felt her reach a zone of my body where she was not welcome, felt her push against the elastic band of my Jockeys. I started to reach down to pull her away.

Most of you will never know the white-hot, electric pain that I felt in that moment, and I'm envious. Gumbo was an instinctive killer, old enough to have mastered the art of rodent death, and she had decided to make a meal of slumbering trouser mouse. A gaping maw of recurved, needle-sharp teeth overtook the head of my cock in the same way I'd seen her overpower so many mice and rats. I gasped, and my right hand shot down the front of my pants to pull my poor dick away from the ravenous serpent.

Now, a snake whose meal is being taken from it will react in one of two ways. A shy, small snake will give up, let go, slither away. But Gumbo was a fighter. I felt her tense all four-plus feet of her body, steel herself against my thigh, and pull backward. My vision blacked out for a second. Still, my left hand dove into the breach (breeches?), and grabbed her by the neck. And now my pickle was in a pickle. I couldn't let go with either hand, because she might pull more or swallow deeper. But if I didn't let go, she couldn't either.

Somehow, my ex had missed the whole thing. With more calm than I felt, I called her over and explained the situation. She gingerly helped me slide my pants off. Her eyes went wide.
""Wow. She's uh... she's really got you there.""
We discussed the situation; I felt helpless. Luckily, she remembered that many zoos keep rubbing alcohol near the cages for their large constrictors. If the snake attacks, pour alcohol in its mouth and it'll let go. We were out of isopropyl, but we had some Bombay Sapphire gin. She ran and got it.

In that moment, I learned that there is only one pain worse than a large snake trying to devour your penis. It's pouring alcohol into the wounds being created by the large snake trying to devour your penis. Luckily though, Gumbo and I shared a disgust for gin. She unhooked her teeth and backed away. My wife took her over to the sink and rinsed out her mouth while I pinched my glans to staunch the blood flow. I ran to the bathroom and showered, cleaned my wounds, assessed the damage. If there's an upside to a snakebite, it's that the teeth are thin and needle-like, and don't mash or tear their prey. I suffered some tenderness and bruising for about a week, but no infection or scars. But since that day I've had a firm rule: only one snake in the pants at a time, and there's already one there.

TL;DR: I let a large snake snuggle in the leg of my shorts. It took a mouthful of my dick and wouldn't let go. My ex-wife saved the day with a bottle of gin.

EDIT: This dude narrated and animated my story, and it cracked me up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ly2xkOrcuM&amp;app=desktop
If anyone else is interested in doing something similar, please message me-- I'd love to narrate it myself if somebody wants to help. I've been told that I have a perfect voice and face for radio!"
"TIFU by bringing a new water bottle to the gym


This is actually a YIFU. I'm training for a half marathon but I'm pretty new to running. Yesterday was only the 2nd time in my adult life ever on a treadmill (I usually run outdoors). I figured I was a pro after figuring most of the buttons out a couple weeks ago so I headed back to train while avoiding the weather. I thought I was really prepared this time because I brought headphones and a bigger water bottle (ain't nobody got time to stop and fill that shit halfway through). I start my run and it's going fine. After about a mile I decide to grab a swig of water from my very full water bottle while running at a 6 mph pace. 

I carefully open the lid and begin to bring the water bottle toward my face when I realize this is not going to work. I usually use a disposable water bottle with a small opening and I'm able to easily drink while running. The bottle I brought today has an opening the size of a normal drinking glass. This is not ideal for drinking while running. As this revelation dawns on me, panic begins to set in. 

Did I mention this is a tiny gym and there are about 6 people in my close proximity working out and there are mirrors everywhere? I cannot drink my water, and I'm going too fast to set it down without it sloshing everywhere. I realize that I need to make a quick decision about how to remedy this situation without spilling water everywhere. Like the pro I am at treadmills, I remember that there is a pause button and I desperately reach out and touch it and begin to feel relief as I stop running... but the machine does not stop running. 

Apparently pause means ""begin to slow down and then stop in a little while."" My brain and body could not come together to figure this shit out and somehow I end up going down on my left knee while holding my ~~stupid fucking~~ glorious water bottle up toward the heavens. I slowly slide off the back of the treadmill while maintaining this pose. 

When I reach the bottom, I hop up, take a swig of water, and start running again like nothing happened. Everyone else around me also continues on without acknowledging my fuck up except the girl a few treadmills to my left who is stifling a laugh. I then proceed to run the next 8 miles I need to run with a pretty gnarly brush burn on my ankle.

TL;DR fell off a treadmill in a slow motion genuflect; worst injury from running yet is caused by a fucking treadmill

"TIFU by taking my wife to Applebee's.


I guess I should point out that this story started at Applebee's. My pregnant wife looooooves the French onion soup there. After running errands and having our lunch at Applebee's, we went home to relax. We both decided to take a hot shower together and put on comfy sweats and T's so that we could watch a few back episodes of Wentworth. 

As I stood behind my wife in the shower, I realized that she always finagles her way into the front part of the shower to leave me with the tail end of the warm water. I realized I could get a little quiet redemption by peeing at her feet and ankles. As she started rinsing her hair of shampoo, I took careful aim and let a steady stream shoot at her feet. What I didn't realize was that she had her eyes open, looking at the water below her. She couldn't feel the warm stream but could see the miscolored water and caught a slight smell of urine. ""ARE YOU PISSING ON ME?"" She yelled at me. I couldn't help but laugh and nod yes like a shameful child. She responded by hawking a nasty loogie and spitting it on me. Now, I knew I deserved it but we had gone this far so I figured, why not? And with that, I fired a tremendous snot rocket at her. As she tried to dodge it. It landed in the back of her hair. She shrieked, ""Is it in my hair?"" Through belly rolls of laughter I exclaimed ""YES"". 

Now I guess snot is where she draws the line because she started dry heaving at the thought of snot in her hair. It wasn't more than three more dry heaves before she lost every single ounce of her delicious French onion soup all over the shower floor. The smell of her half digested French onion soup was almost unbearable and I couldn't help but start dry heaving at the stench. Lets just say I didn't get to keep any of my lunch either. 

Although we both started cracking up at our ""stand by me esque"" barf o rama, I think I learned to never pee on my wife's feet in the shower again. "
"TIFU by hurting a copy cat


This actually happened at about 5am, I was just finishing up an essay I totally didn't procrastinate or plagiarize 70% of and I was getting ready to command P the f*** out of the paper, when I shoved the scanner down i didn't realize that my cat was sleeping on it. I smashed her tail in it pretty bad and she meowed so loud I'm sure my neighbors heard.. She ran under one of the couches and hasn't came out since, looks like I'll just have to accept the fact that in the eyes of poor little Mia I'm a dangerous serial killer out to take one of her nine lives away 

Tl;dr I turned my cat into a 8x12 piece of white paper "
"TIFU by not disabling Amber/Weather Alerts


So I'm in the shop rocking out at decent volume to some awesome Spotify concoction. In my groove, singing off key, with my super-duper bass wireless headphones. Now, tangentially speaking, but ill get back to my point, your phone is designed to broadcast these amber/weather alerts whenever the powers that be decide there is something you should know immediately. Your phone does this with an extremely shrill, high volume, repeating sound and rapid vibrations so you are unable to miss said alert. I don't know if I've ever come as close to being scared to death as I did when that flash flood warning just came through. My earphones, close to full volume, broadcasted that shrill sound at a volume that can only be described as, the sound the SpaceX Rocket would make if it actually took off from your inner ear and exploded before getting off the platform. I fell back, running power tool still in my hand, tripped on the garbage can and went ass over tea kettle into an area of my shop that rarely gets swept. So here I am, laying in sawdust and filth, ear drums figuratively bleeding, telling you the story about the time I was almost killed by a weather alert."

"TIFU by using a fallen tree as a bridge


This didn't happen yesterday - in fact, it happened in the summer of 1984.

I was 11 years old, and I went to a summer program at the University of Virginia. It was fun and educational, particularly a nature class which involved going into various nearby woods, streams, etc., and investigating the plants and creatures in those environments. A few days before the class ended, we students had to do an in-depth project in one of the areas we'd studied.

I chose to do my project on a particular stream, and nobody else picked that environment, so I was out investigating on my own. (It didn't occur to me at the time that it might not have been the best idea to send an 11-year-old boy out on his own in those circumstances.)

Having finished with one side of the stream, I naturally wanted to cross over to the other side. The stream was very shallow (though fairly wide) and I could easily have walked through the water, but I noticed a nearby tree had fallen over and provided a perfect bridge across the stream. So of course I went for that, because it was a tree bridge and I was 11 years old.

I put one foot on the near end of the tree. As soon as I shifted my balance to take another step, there was suddenly an incredibly loud buzzing sound. This was followed by a huge angry swarm of yellowjacket wasps from the hive that was clearly attached to the underside of the tree.

I turned and ran, the yellowjackets following and stinging me on every available patch of skin, including in my ears. Happily, I was not allergic to their stings, because I'm sure I would have died from anaphylactic shock if I had been. But holy crap did that hurt. I probably ran faster than I ever had before, and as I approached the check-in area the yellowjackets mostly left. I'm sure the look on my counselor's face when he saw what had happened to me was priceless, but I was too busy being in intense pain to notice.

The pain didn't completely go away until about three weeks later. The memory of the pain is still vividly with me, nearly 33 years after it happened.

TL;DR: When I was 11 at a summer program, I angered a hive of yellowjackets by stepping on the tree trunk their nest was attached to. I got stung all over, including in my ears."

"TIFU by supergluing my phone into the wall at work


I used to work at a gas station and it was a terrible job. I compensated for the stress of it by [redacted]

One day I found myself dicking around in the backroom after I finished stocking the cooler, and I spotted a mousetrap near the wall about six feet from me. I was standing there texting and I began to wonder what would happen if the mousetrap snapped shut on my phone. I knew people can stick their fingers in mousetraps and it wouldn't break the bone or anything, so I decided my phone would probably be fine. So, I went ahead and tossed my phone at the mousetrap. 

The mousetrap snapped shut and flipped into the air, and my phone disappeared.

I stood there, mouth open, scanning all over the room for any sign of my phone. I ran over to the wall and looked all around. Nothing.

That's when I noticed a small crack in the wall right against the corner, maybe three inches tall, with the bottom being on the floor. Just barely wider than the width of my phone. I didn't believe it at first, but I grabbed a screwdriver and poked it into the crack, and sure enough, I could feel an object wiggle inside.

The mousetrap shot my phone into a crack with dimensions only slightly larger than the phone itself, and the phone settled into a crevice within, about an inch below floor level, maybe 4 inches from the wall. The sheer odds of this--especially if you could see it for yourself--were unimaginable.

I spent several minutes trying to free my phone before I realized I needed to go get our toolbox and take some time to figure this out. So I went and told my manager what happened because we were friendly with each other. He laughed at me for literally minutes as I told him what happened and then showed him the crack. Eventually he went back to the registers and let me try to retrieve it.

So I tried everything. I tried a duel screwdriver system to lift and pull it out but I couldn't really get purchase. I tried every other tool, but most couldn't fit.

Finally I had a good idea. I realized that my big problem was grasping the phone, so I put a bit of superglue on the end of a screwdriver and sat the tip on the phone to dry, that way it would become solid and I could lift it straight out.

What actually happened was I superglued my phone into the crevice, and secured it in place for all coming time. I never saw that phone again.

It had catapulted into the wall on full charge, and for the next three days my boss took relish in calling my phone when I was in the backroom, so I could listen to it ring from inside the wall.

If that's not bad enough, I even lost contact with friends that I've since never spoken with, because I only had their contact on that phone.

EDIT: -Due to popular demand, I will be taking a picture of this crevice the next time I visit Dallas, probably in a month or less. I will also seek permission to try to retrieve my phone.-


TLDR: Threw my phone at a mousetrap that flung it into a crevice in the wall. Stupidly used a method of retrieval that involved superglue. Never got my phone out of the wall."
