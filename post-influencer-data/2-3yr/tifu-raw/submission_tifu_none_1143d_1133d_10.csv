"TIFU by drawing a magical sword during an important meeting at work.


Today there was a full team meeting at my company.  About 20 of us were gathered in the main conference room, with another office (and several ""tele-commuting"" workers) conferenced in on the flatscreen.  We were reviewing progress on some of our work, as well as discussing clients and performance.  It was an ""all hands"" meeting and fairly high level, with the CEO and CTO in attendance, etc.

Anyway - I have no idea why, as I haven't drawn one since I was in elementary school, but about halfway through the meeting I grew restless, turned the page of my moleskine notebook, and started doodling a sword - something I used to do a lot as a child (and haven't done in 30 years...). I have no idea why I did this...  I must have zoned out completely because the CEO had to ask loudly (and maybe repeatedly): ""What is that?""  When I returned to reality, I looked up to see the entire room staring at me, and the CEO asked again ""What is that?  What are you doing?"" and he started laughing.  ""Let me see that."" He said.  I flushed red and reluctantly admitted: ""It's a sword.""  The ENTIRE room erupted in laughter and borderline sympathetic cackles, and the CEO took my notebook and held it up for everyone to see, including the video-conferenced coworkers.  I shrank in my seat as someone pointed out the sun-sparkles on the blade and asked me if the hilt was jeweled. One of the newly hired kids asked aloud what its DPS was, which made the entire IT department erupt into laughter again.  I wanted to die, and quickly apologized... when the laughter died, the meeting carried on - this time with me at rapt attention.  However, I endured redfaced stifled laughter looks from everyone in the room for the duration of the roundup.

I'm 40, and again - I haven't drawn a sword since I was a kid.  No idea why I did this but of course when I decide to it's in the worst possible place with the worst possible outcome.

"TIFU by hitting on a girl and getting disowned


This literally unfolded over the last few hours

Every other year me, my siblings and my parents take a vacation together. It's a good way to bond since my siblings live in different countries and while i don't exactly agree with my family on many things we all love each other. Well. So I thought. 

It is necessary to point out I am a lesbian and my family are good people but conservative due to their culture (Georgia, the country not the state). Obviously I am closeted. 

We are currently in Europe on vacation and we went out for lunch. On a table across from us sits a girl who occasionally catches my eye and smiles or plays with her hair. That combined with her Ruby and Sapphire t-shirt makes me suspect she might be interested in me. The girl is also mind-numbingly hot, to the point I forget that gaying around in the presence of my family is not a good idea. 

So when we are leaving I find a moment and ask the waiter to pass her a note with my number saying ""didn't find the courage to walk up to you. Will you forgive me? ;) "" When we walk out of the restaurant I see her reading the note and smiling, SCORE!

We walk to the hotel and I realise my younger brother is not with us. I ask my Dad and he just laughs and says my brother asked to stay behind a little bit. 

Well it turned out my brother stayed behind to sit with the girl and ask her out. She turned him down and he was confused and mentioned how she was totally smiling at him all this time and she just fucking had to go and say ""No I was actually flirting with your sis. She gave me her number. Lulz."" WTF random European girl 

So my brother stomped up to the hotel and proceeded to tell everyone and we had a huge ass fight with my family and I was backed into the corner and with not much room to lie and suddenly I was fucking done worshipping Georgian ""family values"" (think a culture similar to Asian i guess) so I told my parents if they won't stop their bullshit and listen to me I was leaving bc I am 23 year old and not here to be yelled at and promised to be grounded. My mother looked me into the eye and told me ""if you leave you will never be a part of my family again"" and I snapped and said ""well fuck you you cruel bitch"" (not my proudest moment) grabbed my shit and left

So now I am sitting in a Starbucks and I am honestly kind of numb. I have my wallet, laptop, documents and other important stuff but most of my things are in the suitcase in the hotel room. I am so numb. I knew my parents would react badly if I were found out but I never thought they would disown me. Their unconditional love for me was always my bedrock. Also, I am slowly coming to realise that while I have a job back in Russia that can support me my parents' promise to fund my education in London where my brothers live is now probably moot so - goodbye chances to leave Russia

All because that girl was a stupidly hot blonde wow 

TL;DR: am gay, hit on a girl. brother also hits on a girl, she outs me to him. i get disowned. topkek 

UPD: had to relocate as my starbucks closed. Honestly overwhelmed at the amount of the support that I received in the meantime, thank you for your kind words and messages. I wish I could reply individually but that doesn't seem feasible, but I'll be gathering my life together. My older brother's blowing up my phone - not sure if he's doing it out of his own volition or my parents are using him as messenger so they don't have to compromise their pride. But I am not interested in talking at the moment either way"
"TIFU by ignoring a pimple


This fu didn't begin today but I'm still suffering the consequences so I think it counts.

Last fall I noticed a red dot on the side of my breast. It was the day before my first ever vacation to the beach and I had been planning the trip for a year. The dot seemed more painful than what one might expect from your run of the mill skin blemish. NOTHING was standing in the way of my vacation though so I finished packing and headed of on what wound up being a grand adventure with the exception of this annoying dot morphing into a major health problem.

Fast forward 8 days to the final day of vacay. Whilst shaking the sand out of my top I start to experience a pretty intense burning sensation. Take a peek and see that the dot has now become the size of a golf ball. Since I'm at this point a 10 hour drive from home I decide to wait until I get back to call the doc. 


Fast forward about 36 hours. My dr is on vacation and the fill in is booked. Pain is at this point severe and I'm running a fever. Haul my idiot self to the ER. The (male because that's my luck)nurse has a difficult time masking the look of horror on his face. He was very sympathetic though. I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter ""holy shit that has to hurt"" as he mercifully infused the morphine. 


12 hours later they wheel me into the OR. 4 hours and about 1/4 of my boob later I wake up in recovery. I wont describe the torture and excruciating pain that ensued over the next week as they assaulted my system with intense medications to fight the systemic infection coursing through my veins. I will say that it was on par with the emotional distress of waiting for the pathology report. Dr was fairly certain it was Inflammatory Breast Cancer. 
Path report was negative thankfully. The culprit? A single ruptured hair follicle. 

 
Two weeks after being discharged I was admitted again for surgery. It has been 6 months. It still hasn't healed. I'll require at least one more surgery before they can start the process of reconstructing the breast. All because I ignored a pimple. 


TL;DR  :  I ignored a tiny red pimple because I was leaving for vacation, had emergency surgery, lost half of my breast


edit: 1st- I meant absolutely no offense by my comment about the nurse being male. He was awesome!  the issue was all my own, I'm naturally very modest and it was embarrassing for me. He did a great job at putting me at ease. As much as possible given the circumstances. 


2nd- thank you everyone for sharing your stories.  I'm overwhelmed with trying to respond to all of the comments but it does help to know I'm not the only one. 


3rd- no pics. See edit #1. I have one pic post-op bandaged but I still keep it covered around my husband and disrobe with my back to the mirror.  "
"TIFU by getting nervous after deciding to try to ask a waitress out.


So this happened about 30 minutes ago, throw away because my friends know my original account and they can never find out.


So, I decided to eat at my favorite restaurant for lunch. It was my favorite restaurant not only because of the awesome food (especially when hung over or drunk), but also because of a particular waitress. We'll call her M. This waitress and I had been flirty for about a year or so, she would take breaks when I came in to talk, or take a smoke break next to me, or just random conversations while she worked. She always worked the same shift, and often times if I went in at the end of it, she would have a quick bite to eat with me, or I would walk her to her car as I was leaving. M was actually really cute, a rare thing for a restaurant like this, and though she was about 5 years younger, I couldn't help but be attracted to her. I decided today when I went to the restaurant, I was just going to take the risk and ask her out.


Fast forward to me going to the restaurant for the first time in a few months because I'd been away for work. I went near the end of M's shift so that I wouldn't be asking her out in front of her coworkers or staff, as much out of respect for her as it was I didn't want to be embarrassed if she said no. Of course M comes over and says hi, and we talk for a bit, then she has to get back to work because they're starting to have a rush. Well, a bit later, another regular comes in, an older man that everyone enjoys talking to. This particular man was a bit slow, so the staff shows a bit of extra care and patience with him so that he feels welcome there.


Well, the older customer is joking with everyone, and trying to decide where he wants to sit, and M decides to be helpful. She asks him if there was a certain waitress he preferred, and told him who was working what section. Well, she ends with ""and this is my section, do you want me?""


The fuck up: As soon as I heard that, for whatever fucking reason, my body decided this would be the perfect time to tell her how I felt, so without even consulting my brain, my mouth blurted out ""Hell yes"" very loudly. Loudly enough for about half the restaurant to hear. 


The reactions were immediate. The cook burst into uncontrollable laughter, the older waitresses gave me dirty and disgusted looks, and a few of the customers were politely trying to hold back their laughter, and one almost spit out his drink. Mercifully, M was behind my table at this point, so I didn't see her reaction, but since instead of asking her out I had suddenly turned the situation into a horrible sexual innuendo, I can't imagine it was a positive one. Thankfully, I had cash on me for once so I threw down a $20 and left with my head down and without looking back. I guess on the bright side she got a little over $9 for a tip? Looking back though, I really wish I would've at least apologized before leaving.


TL;DR: Went to a restaurant with the intent of asking out a waitress I'd been acquaintances with for about a year, ended up making a horrible sexual innuendo in front of the entire staff and customers. 


Edit: To everyone telling me to go up there ASAP, I will be going up there in the morning, hopefully fairly early, but before lunch. I'll be sure to keep you guys updated, thanks for all the support!


Edit 2: Well guys, I did it. Just got back from the restaurant, and things went... Ok-ish? I woke up, showered, put on a decently nice button up shirt, made the drive over to the restaurant, and drove right past it.


Yep, nerves got the best of me again, but after 2 or 3 minutes I managed to convince myself to turn around. Got to the restaurant, went inside and sat at my usual spot. Different cook today, thank God, he's a good guy and would have probably made a few friendly jokes about it, but that was one conversation I didn't wanna have until after I had spoken to M. Anyways, M came out and said hi, took my order as usual and basically acted like the entire prior events hadn't happened. I asked her to join me on a smoke break, where I apologized for what happened. She laughed about it and said it was fine, and that she had heard a lot worse. I finally built up the courage to ask her out for coffee (weirdly, I don't even drink coffee, but I couldn't think of anything else), but sadly, she declined. Apparently she's going out of state tomorrow for a vacation before she starts grad school in a couple of weeks. She did give me her number though, and said that we should get together when she gets back! Not exactly the ending I was hoping for, but I figure I've waited this long, another week won't kill me. Now I just need to figure out if the 3 day rule applies here since we've been flirting for so long...

"TIFU and caused £1.1 million in damages


A few years ago, I took on a part-time lab technician job. I spent a lot of my time in the Instrument Laboratory running a piece of equipment everyone had dubbed “The Bitch”. “The Bitch” when switched on, continuously pumped and drained water through herself, like a really weird fountain. 


I hated this machine. I’d obviously pissed off the Lab Gods somehow and “The Bitch” was sent in retaliation; it took forever to start-up, meaning I had to come in over an hour early just to switch it on and watch it decide whether to work or not. It would troll everyone by creating an issue one minute, magically fixing itself, then creating a whole different, unrelated problem a few hours later. It had even managed to set fire to the computer it was hooked up to. Twice. 


 One Friday morning, I started ~~preparing blood sacrifices for~~ “The Bitch” up and went to get my samples, etc for a fun-filled day of ~~swearing at “The Bitch”~~hard work and learning.  I forget what, but on my way back to the bitch’s lair I was asked to do some other task elsewhere in the building. So I went back to the rabid beast; started her shut down process and other protocols, turned off the tap, stored my samples, thanked the Lab Gods for their mercy and fucked off.


Monday morning comes and I am scheduled to battle “The Bitch” for the day, I was combat ready and first into Mordor. As I reached the hallway, I noticed some water on the floor. Not a little water, A LOT of water. My first thought was a pipe had burst upstairs and was leaking into the lab, but no. No, no, I’m not that lucky. After shutting off the power to the room and phoning my line manager, I punched in the code to open the ~~cage~~ door and scrambled out of the path of a surfing office chair. 


After re-gathering all my whats, I waded into a deleted scene from the Poseidon Adventure. The entire room was flooded, and not just 1 or 2 inches of water, oh no, there was over a foot (the water marks were even higher in some areas; apparently the lab is on a slope, who knew). Most of it had escaped down the hallway when I opened the door, but there was still half a swimming pool in the room.


I could see what had caused Waterworld: The Lab Edition from the doorway. “The Bitch’s” hoses had ruptured spraying arcs of water all over the place like the damn Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas. Ummm, remember when I said I’d turned off the tap? Yeah, apparently I hadn’t.


I’d left the tap on.


Full force.


For over 72 hours.

 
Oops.  


The place was a fucking mess. Plastic-ware, glassware and sample bottles, that had  bobbed along in the floodwaters, made a bid for freedom when I opened the door and were now partying it up in the hallway. All of the paperwork and file boxes looked like they had been rescued from the Titanic and the furniture was now much more Feng Shui.


We eventually found that “The Bitch” was dead; drowned and claimed by Poseidon, never to be resurrected (yay). Most of the computers had also been consigned to Davy Jones Locker along with most of the samples and paperwork. The water had caused problems in the walls of the room too, meaning the entire lab had to be moved elsewhere, and a lot of the furniture had to be replaced.


But that wasn’t the worst of it.


Not by a long shot. You see, “The Bitch” sat on one end of a long bench, with the sink at one side and a computer terminal at the other. At the opposite end of that bench; disassembled and being temporarily stored until its new room was built, was a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). 


Yeah, could someone revive all the scientists that just fainted, please? I’ll wait.


For those of you unfamiliar with this piece of equipment, all you need to know is that it’s a very fancy microscope and this particular model came with *all* the extras. Oh, and it was worth roughly 1.1 million GBP (alternatively, using today’s exchange rate for a few currencies, that’s roughly; 1.45 million USD, 1.88 million AUD, 1.3 million EUR or 1.85 million CAD).


And I drowned it. 
  

On a completely unrelated note, I don’t work there anymore.


**TL; DR: Left a tap on for 72hrs while attached to a piece of lab equipment, the hoses burst and drowned the lab and some very expensive equipment.**  


**Edit:** Firstly, thank you very much to everyone who gilded this post. Secondly, no, I was not fired. I left about 5 months later to focus on my studies.

 

I just want to clear a few things up that I don’t think I’ve explained very well:

**”The Bitch”**

* As I said, the bitch works by pumping water through itself. It connected by plastic tubing to an ordinary tap/faucet, with a drainage hose down the drain of the sink. You could very easily set this up in your own bathroom or kitchen sink. When the tap is on and the machine is on water continuously flows through the machine and down the sink.

 

* When the machine is **off** and the tap is **on**; water gathers in the machine with nowhere to go, the pressure builds and in this case the tubing split (inside the machine first but that didn’t release enough pressure so other hoses burst too). Essentially what I did was leave a tap on with a very expensive plug still in the sink.

 

* ""The Bitch's"" replacement works exactly the same way (though it has reinforced metal tubing) same set up, except now part of the shutdown protocol is that the machine must be physically unconnected from the tap. So now you can physically see if you’ve left the tap on (really hard to see through the tubing) and if you do leave the tap on, it’s just a sink with a running tap. I know this system isn't much better but this was ~6 years ago so the protocols have probably changed again by now (hopefully).


* I’ve mentioned in the comments that “The Bitch” performs Particle Size Analysis; I’m going to err on the side of caution and not saying what type of machine it is or what type of particles.



* I’m not entirely sure how “The Bitch” set fire to its computer that was before I started working there. As far as I am aware, some temperature sensor failed in the machine and it over heated (I don’t know why it didn’t automatically shutdown, that’s way out of my area of knowledge). The machine sort of melted/smoked which spread to the computer causing a small fire. The failed sensor was replaced, with another defective sensor (I was told that this turned out to be the suppliers fault) and it happened again.  

 

**The TEM**


* I have no idea who authorised the TEM being stored in that lab. It was meant to be there for a few days before being moved to its proper room. It was not set up and was not operated in “The Bitch’s” lab. It was however, out of its packaging I do remember that, again I don’t know why. Part of the reason I don’t think I was fired was because the TEM *really* shouldn’t have been in there, it was an active lab and anything could have happened.

 

* I’m pretty certain everything was insured, everything was replaced anyway, I never asked.

"TIFU by having sex with two transvestites in the Philippines and becoming their captive.


This happened in 2013.
I was 19 and experiencing the first week or two of drinking alcohol in my life. I was on a street called Burgos Street, that is known for it's pay for hire activities. However, I was actually there to visit a cute waitress at a bar that I met at a nightclub. (The waitress was not a sex worker nor a dude by the way). It was late so I left the bar to get a taxi. They were usually abundant but I couldn't find a cab so I decided to walk around the block. A random girl asked if I wanted a massage. She said it was about $15 USD and I was like sure, correctly assuming a sexual encounter would occur. (I was there to visit the waitress girl on friendly terms, but I really wanted sex and didn't think I could get it otherwise). She holds my hand and begins to lead me to a hotel. On the way back to the hotel, another girl asks if she can join so I was thinking ""awesome!"". I had never done any of this before but thought the massage would be somewhat sexual. They led me in the room and had me shower. By this time, I was realllly excited.  

For some reason, something in my mind clicked and I realized these girls might actually be men. I began to notice their voices sounded more like men pretending to be women. By this point, I was too excited and drunk so I told them that I knew they were men and that I wanted to play anyways. They stripped down and I took turns playing with both of them. Afterwards, I showered again and they asked for payment. I was thinking it'd be like $30 still, and they were like, ""the (pesos equivalent) was for a massage. Sex costs more."" At this time, I was like, oh shit. They wanted $75 each. I told them I don't have that much money and they said that they could take me to their manager. At this point, I'm like, I really messed up. I want to avoid meeting the ""manager"" so I tell them I'll go to a certain ATM and that my debit card only works with ""B.O.A"", never completely saying Bank of America. Over the course of an two hours, we drive in a taxi from mall to mall in search of the non existent B.O.A. ATM's. They are getting frustrated and telling me that I should just ask my stepbrother for the money back at the hotel. (I may have mentioned that I was on a family vacation while inside some ladyboy....)       
  
During the mall visits, I'm pondering whether I can run away from the guys and escape their sight. At another instance, we're waiting for a hotel and I was considering hopping a fence and booking it. Anyways, at the final taxi I would take that night, I get in the taxi and quickly lock the door. The driver of the taxi, being polite, unlocks it for the other guys. I let out a quick ""NO!"" and the taxi driver knows he made a mistake. The guys get in and we drive around for a while, stopping to ponder our decision. Taxi driver knows whats up. He locks all but one of the interior doors of the cab. I get in and lock it. I say ""here's $20 bucks, get me to my hotel."" The guys get in another taxi and begin following me. Eventually, my driver loses the other vehicle and brings me to my hotel. He asks, ""Don't they know what hotel you're at?"". Fortunately, although I originally told my actual hotel in the early chaos, they forgot it and I named a new hotel that was away from mine. I mentioned the random hotel's name several times to reinforce in them that that was my hotel. Perhaps they ordered their taxi driver to head to my decoy hotel. During the drive back to the hotel, my driver couldn't stop laughing at my situation...  
    
 I've never told anyone this because it's so embarrassing... 
I was so worried I was going to get injured by their ""manager"" or have to reveal to family that I needed money to pay 2 angry ladyboys. I also wonder if they got in trouble for not collecting payment and being out of service for 2 hours chasing money....

TL;DR: Thought I was paying $30 for sex with 2 cute girls, wound up captive for hours for my $150 sex fee with 2 guys."
"TIFU by putting hair styling gel up my ass


So, I usually sleep naked during the summer cause I don't have an AC in my dorm room. Ever since I started dating my girlfriend, I've been having these weird experiences that I'll dub ""sexsomnia"". I sometimes get up in the middle of the night and do the craziest things to get off without control of myself ( kinda like sleepwalking), then when it actually happens I regain full control of my body and mind. So this time, I was sleeping naked, and i woke up at about 3:30am or so, walked over to my closet and blindly searched for my jar of moisturizing cream, grabbed a jar, and lay down on my bed. I took a wad and proceeded to finger my asshole. It hurt and burned and I don't know why I did it because a few minutes later I woke up with my asshole on fire. Turns out that the perpetrator of this arsical blaze was the jar of cream.
Because it wasn't cream.
It was hair gel.

So there i was, in the bathroom at 3 in the morning, wiping my asshole with wet paper towels and caressing my poor, now-stylish asshole.

TL;DR Tried to moisturize rectum, ended up styling it.

Edit: RIP my inbox

Edit2: It's been a great day peeps. Needless to say i will be sleeping fully clothed tonight."
"TIFU by pranking my boyfriend


Today I randomly learned how to change web text on my own screen using ""inspect element"". I thought it would be hilarious to edit some posts on my boyfriend's Facebook and send him the screenshots to make it look as though he has been hacked.

BF knows I know his password (I am his personal password reminder) so I had to make it seem legit or he would assume I edited his posts using his profile. I changed some of the comments posted by his brother -whose email and password I couldn't possibly know- using some very, very crude language. I took pictures of my fine work with my phone and sent them to BF via Whatsapp asking, ""what the heck is going on???"" As I expected he lost his shit. 

The unfortunate part is that I was distracted by a coworker and was unable to reveal myself on time. By the time I called him to confess my sins he had already sent the pics to his brother. He, in turn, had posted it on his profile to warn the community.

BF responded to my confession by hanging up on me and blocking me on Whatsapp. By now the pics have spread to the whole family, exposing me as a horrible, childish, crude troll. I was eventually unblocked and shamed for my childish behavior. I tried explaining that the ""edit"" could only be seen by me but the damage had been done. I am now hated by both my BF and his very religious family. 

Worth it :')

Edit: 1 I had to use a crappy phone app to edit the pics for, you know, safety. 
2 I mentioned in the post that I took the shots with my phone because windows + print page would mean id have to send to my phone blah blah. 
3 I warned you I'm offensive and childish, but in my defense all the fb posts said hackers post sexual stuff. And my point was to offend. 
4 I know how to spell swallow (but jokes about me lying are welcome)
Soo here are two examples of my fuckup. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/e1UfO"
"TIFU by making some ugly drawing on MS paint (and sending them)


So this happened a couple of years ago when I was graduating high school. I was just recently reminded of it so I thought I’d share it.

I had a sort of rival in high school. We would often pull “pranks” on each other. They were usually just small ones where no one got hurt or in trouble. It was pretty fun to do as we had a lot of classes together in grade 9 and 10. I didn’t see him as much in 11 and 12, but in the back of my mind I had already decided to pull a big graduation prank on him back in grade 10.

&amp;nbsp;

So finally grade 12 comes along. Exams were finished for us a month before graduation/ regular exams. For that month, I went on vacation to celebrate. While outside the country, I devised a “prank” that I could do without actually being back at school. I would pretend to be my rival and send an email to some teachers that had previously taught us. I wanted to make sure the prank wouldn’t get him into too much trouble so the email wouldn’t go on to say anything particularly bad. It’d just be a sort of funny email with some drawings using ms paint.

&amp;nbsp;

While creating the email, I decided the scale was too small. Just to the teacher who taught us? That’s so few. Lame. This is a graduation prank; I have to think bigger! So I expanded it to every staff member in the school. For parent-teacher interviews, usually they send a sheet with all the teacher’s names and rooms. I took that sheet and used it to type out all the teacher’s emails (as emails were generally firstname.lastname@school).

&amp;nbsp;

It took a while, but I finally had all the teachers in my mailing list. The email was basically a thank you note. I'll have a link at the bottom if you want to see it, but basically it thanked everyone in the school for their work and was pretty much devoid of anything offensive (though, I had this one really shit teacher and wanted to take a Jab at him so I sort of did. Also the librarians in my school were really annoying so…). And then I sent it at about the same time regular school classes were done. 

&amp;nbsp;

I heard from a few classmates that some teachers had a chuckle. I even received a reply from one of the vice principals commending my rival as a brilliant student (don’t forget, I was pretending to be him. In order to make it convincing, I created a new email address that was similar to his personal one and sent it from there)! Everything seemed great. My rival even said I got him good.

&amp;nbsp;

Jump to the day of the graduation ceremony. I get a call that wakes me up. It’s from the school. They wanted me to come in that day. So I did. Turns out, not everyone was happy about the email. Namely the principal, shit teacher, and librarian. My rival ratted me out for the guy who actually sent the email after he got called in first. (I also learned during that meeting the he tried to retaliate by send an email posed as me. He only sent it to a handful of teachers though). They lambasted me on impersonating another person saying it could be a criminal offense, as well as lecturing me on embarrassing my teacher and the librarian. Turns out the librarian had cancer or something, so it was extra bad to embarrass her? Something like that. They threatened to not let me attend the ceremony. Which wouldn’t be too awful, but it would be difficult to explain to my parents.

&amp;nbsp;

Well my mum was called in. And I had to apologize. I cheekily to my teacher said something along the lines of, “you are the best physics teacher I ever had.” A bit of a back handed compliment because he was the only physics teacher I ever had… so technically he was also the worst. I kept that bit in my head though.

&amp;nbsp;

In the end everything kinda worked out. My mum was a bit shaken up but we attended the ceremony. It was a bit awkward shaking the hand of my principal who had only just lectured me a few hours earlier. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I sent an email pretending to be my rival to all the staff in the school. It had a few silly drawings. Embarrassed a few staff so got called into the school on the morning of graduation.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the email, if you’re interested in seeing the contents.

"TIFU by popping a spider bite.


Wolf spiders are pretty common where I'm from in the Midwest, so getting spider bites wasn't an unusual thing growing up. A couple years ago, I noticed that one of my tattoos on my leg had a big bump with two little dots on it that was pretty painful, so naturally I popped it and thought nothing of it, and went about my day. The next day when I woke up to catch a flight, I had a fever and the entire back of my leg was swollen and red and I could barely put weight on it without it hurting. I go in to the E.R., and the doctors were unsure if the initial bite or an infection caused the swelling and fever, but she said she needed to cut open my leg, drain it, and pack it with gauze. I asked if this could be avoided and her literal response was ""Either we cut open your tattoo now, or we cut off your leg later."" Got the surgery, was given Keflex and sent on my way. Little did I know that I was PRETTTTTYYYY PRETTTYYYY PRETTY allergic to Keflex. When I would take it during the day, I would become groggy and  experience mild hallucinations along with the most exhausting fatigue i've ever felt in my life, and during the night I would wake up to chest pains and both my arms being completely numb. It wasn't until about a week later that I finally called my mom and complained about what the side effects were and she told me I was allergic and to stop taking it and I'm lucky I didn't die. Fuck spiders.

TL;DR I got bit by a spider got an infection in my leg then almost died from taking antibiotics I was allergic to.

EDIT: My mom did not know I was allergic to Keflex, she simply put two and two together (and later verified with a call to the doctor) that I was having an allergic reaction based on what I told her. I had never used Keflex before, just a few other antibiotics.

EDIT 2: Ok I get it, the odds of it actually having been a spider or insect bite are slim to none. I said that the doctor thought it was an ingrown hair but noticed the ""puncture wounds"" so said it may be a bite. I didn't like spiders before this, and i still don't now.

EDIT 3: A harsher reaction to Keflex does not necessarily constitute an allergy, got it. Still going to mention it at the doctor since I reacted that way. "
"TIFU by almost burning my house down trying to smooth out a 3D print


So this happened a couple of weeks ago...

I recently got myself a 3D printer and some filament and got printing.
Somewhere i had read that if you want to smooth out prints you can do an acetone vapor treatment in a closed container.
This would take a couple of hours at room temperature, but i also read that if you heat up the acetone that it can be done in just minutes.

So off i went to get some acetone from the local hardware store and put half a centimeter of the fluid into a large cooking pan.
When i told my wife that acetone was highly flammable, she had the bright idea to get the fire-blanket read 'just in case'.
I laughed a bit but thought it was a good idea anyway.

Then i hang my beautiful 3D printed Mario figure inside of the pan with a wire connected to a wooden spoon suspended on top of the pan.

Then i turned on the stove at its lowest setting as it was just a small layer of fluid to heat up and i didn't need it to get too hot because acetone is, again, highly flammable.

Ok so everything is going just fine, vapor is moving over Mario into the exhaust hood...
Just until i get the bright idea to make it even go faster...

I decide to put the lid on the pan to 'trap' the vapor in an effort to speed this process up.
So first i try a large lid, but it wasn't really suited for this pan.
Then i try the pan's own lid and right as i put it on, shit hits the fan.

I literally had created a rocket engine on my stove (no joke).
This is really what it looked like and how it sounded.

So i quickly grabbed the blanket that my shocked wife was holding and threw it over the pan.
This helped. For like 5 seconds.
I wet a little towel that we normally use to dry our hands with, also this just buys me seconds.

In the meantime i yell to my wife to open the yard-door because i am going to get the pan and put it in the yard.
nope.jpg the pan is way too hot and the flames too high, i risk letting it fall out of my hands onto the furniture and stuff.

But i'll be damned if i let my house get burned down by this TIFU.
So i open up the kitchen window and 'abort' the kitchen fire by throwing the pan outside trough the window.

Problem solved!

But no it's not.
The pan is now under a big conifer in the front yard, and it hasn't rained for weeks.
Everything is dry as fuck.
So yes, it starts burning at the bottom.
I'm like 'FUCK' and run outside and pull the pan from beneath the conifer onto the pavement.
by then the pan almost stopped burning because most of the acetone has burned up.

I don't know how but the conifer stopped burning before getting out of hand, maybe i was quick enough.

So yeah i almost burned my house down.
I got myself a new blanket and also a fire extinguisher the next day.

What happened to Mario? Well he just looks like a lump of molten plastic now.

Funny thing is, that i printed Mario with PLA plastic and that PLA doesn't react with acetone.
So my plan wouldn't work anyway x).

Oh and btw, i have it all on video.
It's footage from our security camera (low fps).
I have a link but the rules prohibit placing it here. Maybe i can post it in the comments.

TL;DR Don't put acetone on your stove, it will burn your house down.

Edit: I forgot to mention that in the process of throwing the pan out of the window all my arm hair from my right arm got scorched and when pulling the pan from underneath the conifer i burned my hands in 8 places. It took about 10 days to heal (no scars =D) no pics of the burns.

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold, stranger!"
"TIFU by filling my hotel bathroom with bubbles


So, boyfriend and I are on vacation; sightseeing, having a great time. Including a pretty posh hotel room; king sized bed, room service, modern, and a jet tub in the bathroom.

Now, as we are here to relax, we decided that our evening should include a bubble bath in said giant tub. In preparation we go to LUSH, ask for bubbles, pick out some bubble bars and we're set!

Neither of us have used bubble bars before. Boyfriend asks me how much to use and I figure one and a half should give us the Hollywood bubbles I've dreamed of, so he throws them in, runs the bath, and we start the jets.

We're dancing in the living room, waiting for the bath to run and cool. Boyfriend periodically checks on the state of the bubble bath and is increasingly concerned about the amount of bubbles.

Now it's relevant to point out that the jacuzzi tub is older and operates through one, variably reliable button, so we tried to stop the jets over the next half hour, but instead prolonged their cycle... 

As the suds threatened to escape the tub area we tried to hold them back with the shower curtain. At this point we figure it's best to just let the jets run their course, since we haven't figured out how to turn them off. So we close the door go to living room and continue dancing for the rest of the hour.

When our playlist ends, we decided we should probably see the state of the bathroom. We peek in to discover a scene right out of a sitcom. Our bathroom is entirely full of bubbles. The shower curtain had put up a good fight, but eventually the suds were too much for it; filling the rest of the bathroom and spilling out into our hotel room once the door was opened.

Resourcefulness on our part won out; we threw on our swimwear, used towels to scoop as many bubbles as possible back into the tub area, and got the floors and walls mopped up before any lasting damage occurred from our personal foam party. Best Fuck up of my life!

Update:
We'll post pictures when we get back to the hotel. None of the pictures show the whole amount because once the entire room was full we immediately started cleaning it up. 

Update 2: 
Here are the pics that were promised!
