"TIFU by volunteering for a fundraiser half marathon without knowing the run route.



Last Saturday I volunteered to be a worker for a half marathon race fundraiser. After I checked in I was driven to the last water point, at a T intersection about 2 km from the finish, so I was told. But I was told nothing else and I asked no further questions. 

Within 15 minutes a pack of very fast runners begin to approach. Their leader yelled to me ""Which way?""
Well, I had no fucking idea. I could either guess left or right. But, the road they were to turn on was a one-way road. So I directed them in the direction of the one-way, towards downtown. I had a 50-50 chance of directing them in the correct direction. I guessed wrong.

For the next 30 minutes or so I directed runners in the wrong direction until one of the race organizers drove by and caught me in the middle of directing another group downtown. We spent the next hour sending vans downtown finding runners and bringing them back like lost kids at a park. 


TL;DR I directed the first 40-60 half-marathoners in a race in the wrong direction (when they were 2km from the finish) causing them to run around aimlessly.

"TIFU by not learning from my daughters mistakes.


This happened to me last week, I was at work bored out of my mind. Playing with a pencil when all of a sudden I got the bright idea to put it in my ear. After a short few seconds of in-ear pencil stimulation I came to the realisation that something was wrong. I wasn't getting the same feeling from my twisty turny motion as I was at the beginning. After a brief second of doubt, fear and confusion I yanked it out. SHIT. SHIT SHIT SHIT FUCK. The rubber on the pencil had vanished. Okay calm down. I'm and adult I can resolve this. Or not. There was no way my stubby finger was gonna be of any use. I looked around after trying the sideways head jump to find some double-sided tape. I'm starting to panic. I stuck some tape on a thin screw driver and into my ear it went. Instant regret. What. The. Fuck was I thinking I mean really A SCREWDRIVER?! I knew I had to go to the hospital. I mustered up the strength to go to my boss. ""I have to go the hospital there's a rubber stuck in my ear."" I didn't even make eye contact with he before hearing her burst into laughter. I left. Waited two hours at the hospital because this was definitely not urgent. I mean a rubber lodged in your ear? Standard. Came back to work the same day. Everyone knows. As if being the IT guy isn't bad enough, now I'm the IT guy who got a rubber stuck in my ear. Great. 

TL;DR I lost a pencil eraser in my ear.

EDIT - First of all, holy shit. Second of all, my daughter. Appologies for not mentioning. Was not intended to be the story, more so the fact that young children commonly do this sort of thing. When she was 4 she managed to get a craft thermocol ball stuck in her ear. I tried some unspeakable methods of removal on the way to the hospital. One of them being a straw and my lungs. Ultimately I took her to the same emergency unit that I went to and they removed it. They did not make a report for her. Apparently my age and relation made it worth documenting. Anyway, thank you to everyone who came here, I'll try my best to read and reply! Adiós."
"TIFU by coming home early


So, me and my GF share a room, and we have two cats. I get off work a bit early, and as I walk in the house, I hear some commotion and my GF yelling something that sounds like ""No!"".

Slightly concerned, as no other cars or anything were around, I run back there just as she is tossing the cat out the door for chewing on my cords. This happens just as I was rounding the frame, so the cat lands squarely on my junk, and tries to use my belly button as a grappling point. It didn't work, but I did get some nice rips in my shirt along with some deep scratches that bled quite profusely. "
"TIFU by making a sarcastic comment in a chat window and ending up in a mental health facility.


So, let me start off by saying I understand that what happened to me was just a series of people trying to do their job. I have no ill thoughts, at least I think, towards anyone involved in my last three days.

It all started off with my application to my student loan provider, regarding the lowering of my student loan payments. They currently stand at a high amount ($250) and are scheduled to raise up to the $400's. Whatever, the system sucks, woe is me.

I opened a chat window with a customer representative, hoping to find a better option than $400 payments. The conversation ended with customer rep saying there was no better option. Me being a sarcastic person replied with something to the extent of, ""Going to school was the worst decision I've ever made and I'll probably end up killing myself. Byyyye!"" I closed the text chat, thinking nothing of it, and went and started the dishes.
Not more than twenty minutes later, the cops are at the door, I'm being cuffed and placed in the back of a cruiser.
I'm taken to a mental health facility, all under the assumption that I'll be assessed and then released in a matter of hours. 

Bad news. Turns out since I was brought in through the police, a three day evaluation must take place, in said mental health facility. I'm placed under suicide watch (for my entire stay) in the flight risk hall.

None of this really sinks in, until about 30 hours later and I still haven't talked to a psychiatrist, social worker, fucking even a nurse that knows what is happening. 

Countless things happened in that three day period that I still can't comprehend. Funny enough, if anyone has read [It's Kind of a Funny Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story) or seen the movie, alot is relatable. I even passed the time drawing pictures and signing them for other patients. I attended all available groups, went to AA meetings, and did everything possible to be normal in hopes to leave after my three days. 
Even though I never experienced any suicidal thoughts, just poor judgement and a poor selection of words, I still felt as if I had to put on an act and jump through hoops to show I'm not suicidal.

I was released after three days, and sit here at my desk in a complete numbness of my experience. I honestly feel worse now that this happened. I missed work, feel like shit, and have an incredibly embarrassing story that will hover over me. Oh and an expensive psychiatrist appointment, not to mention whatever my three day vacation is going to end up costing.

TL;DR: Told someone online, sarcastically, that I was going to kill myself and was placed in a mental hospital for three days under suicide watch. Might have left with an actual mental disorder. Met some interesting people though.

EDIT: This post has been helpful with dealing with this experience. I hope some users have found a little comfort in seeing similar stories, I know I have. For a while after posting I attempted to reply to everyone but fell a little behind and will be turning off notifications. If anyone has pressing questions I'd be more than happy to communicate with private messages. Thanks again."
"TIFU by dressing up as Bukkake


A little over a year ago my friend turned 18 which is the age where you can legally drink where I'm from and he decided to have an ""offensive-themed"" party. I decided that there's not much more offensive than semen so I decided to dress up as bukkake. Basically I just squirted shampoo all over my face which not only stung my eyes but it tasted awful. I was commited though as I reapplied it several times throughout the night. There was also a large fire which by the end of the night had way too much wood on it so it was pretty intense. It was a fairly cold night so I ended up spending the last hour or so around the fire.
One of two things happened then. Either the fire was slowly cooking the shampoo on my face or the shampoo had given me chemical burns bu basically the end result was my face was burned pretty bad.
TL;DR: I accidentally cooked my face with fake cum.

Edit: [There is a picture that somewhat hides my identity but still shows the shampoo for those that are interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4mc3r0/tifu_by_dressing_up_as_bukkake/d3ukalo)."
"TIFU by leaving the windows open


This actually happened today. 

So I live in a high rise apartment block. The aircon recently broke, so I was sleeping with the windows wide open for the past few days. 

As I woke up today, I walked over to the edge of the bed and reached for my phone and accidentally grabbed my Kindle which I was using the night before. It was heavier than my phone so my confused self was, well, confused. It slipped out of my hands and as I didn't have a morning coffee, my genius of a brain decided to kick it to bring it back up to me. 

You can guess the rest - a Kindle booted by my right foot through a window 33 floors up. 

Still haven't found it yet - GG


TL;DR: TIFU by drop-kicking my Kindle out of a window 33 stories up. 


EDIT: still haven't found it...may as well give up as I was gonna replace the kindle soon anyway.... :( "
"TIFU by injuring myself through masturbation, going to the ER, then re-injuring myself hours later (NSFW)


**So a little note: I didn't think this was gonna get nearly as much attention as it did, and I can't really keep up with the replies. So I stuck the answers to the biggest questions at the bottom, I hope that satisfies everyone! Probably won't be in this thread any longer cause I mildly regret making it, but I'll leave it here for your enjoyment...**

Preface: I apologize in advance for adding to the steaming pile of masturbation related posts on this sub. Also obligatory ""this is my throwaway account""

So I'm a teen, it's no secret that we're pretty big fans of jerkin' the gherkin. Some would call it a hobbie. But my love for the singlehanded hanky panky has never seriously wounded me before. Well, until some days ago. 

I had the day off, and I thought I'd celebrate the only way I know how. So I waited until after dinner when the family would be most preoccupied, and locked myself in my room to discretely finish the job. I was going at it a bit rougher than usual, but the feeling was overshadowing the growing pain I felt down there. Disregarding my body's desperate cry for help, I chugged along. 

Suddenly there was a knock on the door, and someone wondering why my door was locked at 6pm. I hastily pulled everything together but noticed something was wrong with my penis. I backburnered that thought and answered the door, muttering something about how I was changing (pretty sure this never works but I like to believe it does). I carried on a conversation with my parents as the pain in my nether regions grows more obvious. 

They finally left me alone, and as soon as I closed the door I practically ripped off my shorts to examine my now excruciating member. First thing I saw was blood. Lots of blood. Gushing out from the head and the foreskin. After the initial rush of terror, I rushed to the bathroom and wiped everything off to get a better look. What I saw was 4 small gashes, 2 on the frenulum and 2 on the head. 

Now lemme stop right here to let you imagine the pain of an open wound on the incredibly sensitive head of your dick. Now with that in your mind, I'll continue.

I panicked a bit but tried to get it together and just let it heal itself. So in an effort to avoid having to bring attention to my condition, I just sat in my room and browsed reddit silently praying my dick would just get better. Sadly, it was not. In fact, it was getting worse by the minute.

So when the pain was finally impossible to ignore I sheepishly told my mom I had ""bleeding in a place I really don't want bleeding"", she got the gist and drove me to the ER. The ride and ER trip were probably the most mortified I've ever been.

So fast forwarding to after the ER, I've been told it'll heal if I'm careful, and I wouldn't need stitches (sigh of relief). 

So here's where being a stupid teenager comes into play. I get home from the ER at night, and after about an hour of being stoic and telling myself ""no jacking off, it needs to heal"", I caved and decided there's no way some careful and gentle jerkin' could upset it all over again. Well, I wasn't technically wrong. The problem was, after getting properly into it, all rules of gentleness went out the window. 

There was no pain so I figured it was totally fine, I was practically laughing at the doctors who said I'd need entire DAYS of care for it to heal well. I finished the deed, and upon cleaning up I noticed a searing pain. As you probably suspected, the jostling of fresh wounds reopened them, but this time the tears were bigger and more alarmingly nasty looking. 

Not wanting to admit I immediately fucked up the doctor's orders, I simply wrapped cold gauze around my dick and went to bed biting my lip from the constant pain. 

Now almost a week later, I was properly scared into treating my nether area nicely, and it did actually start healing. But, the injury to the area was so intense that my doctor says it won't be fully healed for months. So for my intense hormonal urges I get months of discomfort and a mostly out of order dick in return. And that's the story of how I temporarily destroyed my genitals, hope you enjoyed! Cause I sure didn't. 

TL;DR: Choked the chicken until it coughed up blood, immediately forgot doctor's instructions and opened fresh wounds which destroyed my chance of healing anytime soon. 

Edit: Since I'm probably gonna abandon this account, here's answers to the two biggest questions people are asking:

For why I went at it immediately, there was no bleeding or pain before or during it. If there was pain on the second go I would have stopped immediately! But the ""results"" we're delayed. I was trying to be careful but the lack of pain or problems gave me a false sense that everything was fine. It's also worth mentioning that the ER Doctor didn't give me specific instructions and told me that risk of hurting it further was low. My post makes it sound like I got home and just jacked it raw through tears of pain but it wasn't quite like that.

As for how I even managed the injury (people are rightfully very confused by that), It mostly came from tugging a little too hard. Those with foreskins understand that accidental over-pulling can hurt a lot. I discovered that enough of that can cause tears. So basically I got too into it and tore things.

The cuts on the head were most likely just from friction. Usually friction isn't a problem with a foreskin but my aforementioned over-pulling exposed parts that don't usually get any attention (read: aren't used to direct contact), which combined with my rough hands (I work with my hands and at times my palms are like sandpaper) was just a recipe for injury.

And to the people saying this is fake: I don't blame you for being skeptical, but I *really* wish I was lying about this

Hope that answers enough."
"TIFU by lighting my ex's dog on fire...


My ex, and still good friend, and his little dog came to visit. Unlike my dog, he had yet to treat the Yorkie for fleas and ticks this season. Discovered a very large engorged tick on the poor little pup. 

Tried my standard go-to, ""suffocate the bugger in alcohol"" to make it release its bite so I could remove it head and all with a quick yank of the tweezers. 

Except, this time it didn't work. No problem, attempt alternative, burn it's butt with a lighter. 

Yes, I held a lighter to a fluffy little Yorkie drenched in highly flammable rubbing alcohol. According to my ex, who stood paralyzed, I put the ball of flames out in under 3 seconds with my bare hands (I think I have traumatic amnesia), and luckily the little guy got off with nothing more than a bad haircut.

Lesson learned: to remove a tick from a dog,  either A) light a match, put it OUT, and hold it to the butt of the tick on your non alcohol drenched dog (then yank the sucker; or, B) put a little squirt of your go-to flea and tick cream, wait a minute or two, and grab the sucker when he make a run for it.

PS I'm officially the owners I used to condemn from which I've previously rescued dogs. There's just no good context where you don't look like an asshole for lighting a dog on fire."
"TIFU by chemically scorching my testicles...


A few months back I started scratching my nuts a little more than usual.  It was a pleasantly cool spring so I couldn't in good conscious chalk my newfound genital irritation up to muggy weather, which sometimes heats up the underside of my saggy beanbag to the point where I've taken more than few ""timeouts"" from outdoor social gatherings to wipe the sweat away with a paper towel.  Ignoring the problem didn't help.  The itch only intensified, spreading to my butthole like hellfire.  One night I awoke to an itch so excruciating I was reduced to slathering my testicles and gooch in rubbing alcohol - going so far as to putting on a pair of fresh rubber gloves and fingering the remnants of alcohol up my pooper to calm the atrocious sphincter tingle.  Denial would no longer work...I did indeed have a raging case of jock itch.

The 24-hour Wal-Greens was twenty miles away.  Could I make it through the night without applying dedicated medication?  Would my half-ass home remedies work?  The re-emerging tickle in my genitals indicated not.

After purchasing fifty dollars worth of various ringworm, jock itch, anti-fungal sprays, powders and lotions, I immediately started spraying my junk with a gray, aerosol can of Lotrimin powder the second I got back into my car.  Goddamn this fucking itch!  The medication goes on wet then dries to a white film, enveloping my dick and balls with a soothing, wintery coat.  Ahhh...relief.  No, wait...FIRE!!! Jesus Fucking Baldheaded Christ!  What the fuck is happening to me?!  It felt like Lucifer himself was giving me a blazing handjob from hell.  Tears of pain instinctively streamed down my rufescent face.  I struggled to catch my breath.  A minute passed, then another, the searing agony slowly subsiding.  Oh, my poor boys, my precious danglers.  What have I done to you?

Once regaining my composure, masculine reasoning set in: ""Well, you certainly made it through that shitstorm of fury, old boy. The burn you were feeling was obviously the medicine doing its job - kicking that nasty, little fungus' ass. Now reapply!""

""Thank you, sir! May I have another?!"" my mind screamed while I hosed my itchy banana-beans down a second time, upon arriving home.

The same burning sensation nearly brought me to my knees.  Man, this stuff fuckin' works, yo!

Fast forward three days and I'm still blindly dousing my dick, balls, and choad in every goddam product I purchased that night.  That is until I actually took the time to observe my seething sex organs, and read the instructions on some of this medication.  What the fuck?! There's dried-out, leaky open wounds on my nuts!  That's *very* thin skin!  I can't afford to lose flesh there!

What the Christ?!  How did this happen?  And they *still* fuckin' itch!

Apparently, after emptying an entire can of Lotrimin before reading the directions, I realized I used a two week supply of anti-fungal medication in three days on my now blistering fuck-plums.  The itching sensation I was feeling was my poor scrotum meat trying to scab over,  attempting in vain to initiate the healing process, which was continually being thwarted by my brainless reapplications of fiery, death-spray and burning lotion.

I actually thought I might have to head to the emergency room once I showered off and took a good, full look at my crumpled cannoli and parched testicles; they looked like shit run over twice.

Panic-stricken, I started trying every fucking remedy I could think of to nurse my chemically mutilated genitals back to health, without letting my girlfriend know I had inadvertently destroyed them in the first place: dipping my balls in aloe vera after showering and letting them air dry, gingerly applying baby powder, doing hourly moisturizer touch-ups to the trouble areas.  My God, through the obvious lack of masturbation and constant caregiving I was bestowing upon my mangled junk, I'm surprised I didn't develop the Florence Nightingale effect for my own hairy enchilada and its matching sex-olives.

Word to the wise, read the instructions on jock itch medication or suffer the agonizing consequences of accidental genital mutilation.

Epilogue:

Two weeks later and my dick and balls are fine now.  They healed nicely, like it never happened, *and* my jock itch has also been defeated.  Further, and I'm very proud of this for some reason, my girlfriend never suspected a thing.  How's that for keeping my cool?  I genuinely thought my dick might fall off and I still didn't flinch.  Fuckin' A."

"TIFU By eating a sparkler


So this wasn't today, but on Tuesday evening while drinking in a bar I work at.

I'd had many drinks over the course of the previous 5 hours and in pretty good spirits. This changed very quickly when sparklers that are used in fishbowls/cocktails were revealed. I instantly saw it as a good idea to light one, and put it out in my mouth, like you would with a match. No idea why I would think this would be a good idea, and no idea why I thought I wouldn't be badly hurt.

My girlfriend pulls out her phone, begins videoing and lights the sparkler. Luckily at this point for some reason I didn't go directly in to my mouth and on to my tongue, I actually caught my lip and part of the sparkler broke off in to my mouth and seemed to get stuck to the inside of my lip. I panicked and tried to grab it out of my mouth as nothing else felt it was working quickly enough. Eventually most of it came out but some remained which fizzled out.

I carried on with my beer and had a couple more and went home.

The next day was pretty painful, I was sort of ok eating but my face was really numb on the right side and my lip was extremely swollen. 

The video got posted on facebook, it was shared a few times and I got a lot of comments telling me how stupid I am (obviously). I was looking forward to it blowing over and people forgetting it had happened. Which it did, until yesterday a colleague decided to upload the picture to Imgur then one of my colleagues shared it on reddit. Other people then posted it in other subreddits and one of them gained quite a lot of traction, to the point where I was on front page of Imgur and it had been viewed over 1.25 million times. 

There's constant jokes at work about it, I've had many people contacting me, I've replied to a few questions on both Reddit and Imgur and it doesn't seem to be going away!

As of right now, the swelling has gone, I have 2nd degree burns which are reasonably painful but I can eat fine and I have hopefully learned a lesson.

tl;dr Ate lit sparkler, was not a smart idea.

More than happy to answer any questions here.

"TIFU by leaving my clothes unlocked while showering


So yesterday I was working out in my local gym like every other day, I prepared myself in the changing room, I locked up my stuff and made myself mentally ready for the hard work to come. Everything went well so the workout was great and I was satisfied with my work.


After I was finished with the day's pump I went back down to the changing room and I started preparing for the well-deserved shower. I opened the cabinet (you need to bring your own lock for it) and I started pulling out all my normal clothes just to make everything more convenient when I was done showering. so I basically left everything on a bench but my bag and phone which is still locked up in the cabinet. (Basically what I always do). This was my first fuck up. The second fuck up I did was leaving the keys hidden in my shoes which was also left on the bench. On top of that I even fucked up a third time. I somehow ended up packing a fucking face towel instead of a normal towel!


What happens next might not surprise you. After I managed to dry myself with this tiny towel that would only be fit for someone like Tyrion Lannister I went back to the bench and my cabinet. and guess what... My clothes, shoes and EVEN my sweaty and stinking underwear was gone!! my first 10 second reaction was like 'wtf is this, where's my shit?!' and suddenly I'm like 'did I just get robbed! and all I have left is this fucking face towel !!'... Yes, some low-life actually decided to steal my sweaty clothes AND my normal outfit AND my shoes and underwear... Imagine me, a guy who couldn't even bring this ridiculous small towel around his waist, asking strangers for fucking clothes to wear... 

For any wondering a really cool guy gave me some shorts and I can’t thank him enough for that! the way home was a little chilly though. I went by public transport.

TL;DR - my clothes got stolen while showering and the only thing I had left was a face towel. I got home with public transport wearing nothing but shorts.
