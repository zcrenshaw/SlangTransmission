"TIFU By not putting the toilet seat down [NSFW]


My dog loves nothing more than sitting on the toilet seat when I'm taking the shower. The other day though I was having some stomach problems and the world was coming out of my ass. As I sat on the commode almost in tears praying for it to be over, I can hear my dog scratching to get in. I lean over to crack the door not only to let him in, but to let some of the nasty smell out.

When I'm finish I reach for toilet paper and find there ain't none. With a tear in my eye I stand on up, feeling at least 10lbs lighter, and penguin walk across the room to grab some. Next thing I hear is my dumb dog leaping into the toilet and falling down the bowl.

Everything goes slow motion. My Beagle cross is covered in my feces, he's freaking out 'cause he done gone wet and stinks. He leaps outta the commode and hightails it outta the room and runs to my sister's bedroom across the hall.

Now y'all seen dogs when they get wet right? They be shaking and rubbing themselves all on the carpet and up the wall. I hear my sisters hollering and screaming 'cause my dog is spreading my muck all over their sheets, shaking it on their clothes and none of them wanna touch him 'cause he's filthy. They can only sit back and watch in horror as he ruins everything and tries to leap up at them. You see, my dog is a big old marshmallow and loves to jump up on people. 

I'm standing in the bathroom with my junk still out, still needing to wipe, and all the while thinking it might be worth locking the door and climbing out the window to freedom instead of facing my sisters wraths. 

**TL;DR** Beagle cross leaped into the toilet, got covered in my diarrhea, smeared it all around the house, my six sisters gave me hell. 

**EDIT**: Holy shit, thanks for the gold!! Makes all this worth it and definitely a story for the grandkids!

**EDIT 2**: Keep seeing the same comments, so gonna put some answers here

The bathroom door weren’t all the ways open, just about an inch at most. I closed it most of the way after my dog came in, but didn't click it shut so he just used his nose to open it. I had the decency to close the door after.

I’m male and from Alabama (North east), and I’m sorry for how I write. I just write how I speak and grammar never really was my strong point. 

My toilet paper is in a cabinet opposite the toilet, so I wasn’t walking around butt naked in my house. All I had to do was stand on up, waddle three steps, and I was home free.

What I’ve taken away from this is I’m gonna be flushing the toilet more often when I’m having difficulties, and gonna be storing my paper underneath the sink next to the darn toilet within arm’s reach. 

And finally, had some real nice comments about making everyone happy and I’m glad I could bring some enjoyment into your lives. I’m still in the doghouse, ain’t no doubt about that, but feels good to know I made some folks laugh. "
"TIFU trying to clean my blender.


I thought boiling water and dish washing liquid with a quick spin would clean it in a jiffy. What actually happened was the soap expanded so rapidly it burst the lid off and like the eruption of Vesuvius, it rained hell from the sky. I had to hide under a table."
"TIFU by playing Pokemon GO


So a few hours ago I downloaded Pokemon GO (I live in New Zealand) and enjoyed walking around my city collecting items from Pokestops/ capturing Pokemon etcetera, before going home. Around half an hour ago I decided to leave my house and skate around my suburb to see if I could catch any interesting Pokemon, or gain some cool items. About 5 minutes into skating slowly down the footpath my board is blocked by an uneven surface and I go flying across it with my phone. More worried about making a painful landing, I let go off my phone and try to cushion the landing with my hands, but because my reaction time is just as fast as a sloths my face planted the same time my hands reached the pavement. My phone was also thrown directly into the ground, which cracked the screen. Now i'm at home typing this up from my laptop because my phone won't do what I want it to do.

TL;DR - Wanted to catch 'em all, ended up catching my fall (Sorta), oh, and breaking my phone."

"TIFU by losing my virginity to a foreign escort


Obligitory ""this happened on monday"". I’m 25M and I took an extended vacation in Berlin for 3 weeks. I’m overweight and it has caused some self-esteem issues with the ladies over the course of my life. I’m self-conscious about it and, as such, I’ve always been terrified to have any kind of physical relationship.

Whilst visiting Italy for a 2 day detour, I saw a prostitute on the street and it piqued my curiosity. The streets aren’t exactly littered with them where I’m from and it’s illegal there anyway, so it’s never been something I thought twice about. I went back to my hotel and a quick google revealed that prostitution is perfectly legal in most parts of Europe, so I decided to leave my V-card in Berlin. Experience every part of the culture here. As I’d never had a girlfriend and zero sexual experience of any kind up to this point in my life, I’d pretty much given up hope that it was ever going to happen for me, so I made up my mind. End the trip ‘with a bang’. Calibrate my confidence and get that first (if only) time out of the way. So I started doing some research. I looked into brothels all over the city, checked the menus, the prices, etc. I really did my homework and carefully considered my options. I wasn’t just going to throw it away in some nasty place I’d want to forget about. After finding the option that fit with my budget and preferences, I ventured out into the city for one last big adventure before heading back to the states. The subway ride there was gut wrenching; my hands were shaking, my heart was pounding, and when I got off the train I felt like I was going to vomit. I was more nervous than I had ever been in my entire life.

I got there, and it was a classy place. Really nicely decorated. Not ritzy, but elegant and nice. But my anxiety only got worse. I picked a room and they sent in the girls that were available for me to choose from. They came in, spun around, and walked out. One by one. My anxiety worsens yet again, and my glasses literally fogged up. I thought that was something that only happened in movies and cartoons. I picked the girl I liked. They housekeeper came in with a Red Bull on a fancy silver platter for me, and five minutes later the girl I picked came in. She was a Brazilian goddess. Insanely hot, curves in all the right places, and an absolute knockout. I held out a trembling hand full of cash and attempted to discuss terms and compensation with her. Here’s the first part of the fuck up. I quickly realized this girl I picked didn’t speak a single fucking word of English. And now I was too nervous to ask for someone else. From there on out, the two of us were communicating with hand gestures.

She gestured for me to disrobe, and I was so terrified I actually asked her if I could keep my pants on. She shook her head. So I disrobed and said “it gets bigger”. What can I say? I’m a grower, not a show-er. She had me lay face down on the bed and started to massage me. Eventually she flipped me back over and I was totally, completely, 100% flaccid. So she started to use her hand. I don’t know what she thought she was going to accomplish by going so fast, but she was really just mashing it into oblivion. I made a ridiculous “slow jerk” motion with my hand to get her to slow down. Thank God she understood that, or we would have had serious problems. 

The second part of the fuck up, as it turns out, was a decade in the making. I’d been watching porn practically every day since puberty, and my member just wasn’t as excited as I was. So guess who didn’t want to wake up? Yup. A combination of my nerve-wracking fear and a likely over indulgence in adult entertainment had effectively turned my gizzard into a taffy puller. Eventually she got it hard enough to put it in, but she just kind of sat there and wiggled around on it for some reason. Probably because at this point it’s not long or hard enough to do much else with. To clarify, she was on top the entire time. I didn’t move once. I just sort of laid there, petrified, and let her do the necessaries. Anyway, not long after it went soft and slipped right back out again. 

The condom wasn’t doing me any favors. I tried saying the word “bounce”. Huzzah! She understood that one. But all for naught; the next 30 minutes (I paid for 40, mind you) were comprised of switching back and forth between her riding me and her using her hands to get me hard again. Mostly the latter. Her body language and facial expression both indicated, after a while, that this was not something she was used to. Not disappointed or frustrated. More like surprised and confused. Ok, maybe a little frustrated, too. Who could blame her? She had a body that would give a dead man wood. And here she is, struggling to give an erection to someone who is far too young to suffer from erectile dysfunction. At one point I suggested she use her mouth. Turned out she spoke 3 words of English. “That costs extra.” I didn’t have extra, so I had to make do.

No kissing on the mouth and no oral probably didn’t help the situation either. Miraculously, this story eventually had a happy ending, though I have no idea how. She said “come”, so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and focused. Unfortunately, with my eyes closed, I was so preoccupied with finishing that I didn’t pay any attention to what she was doing down there. Cue fuck up number three. When she was finishing me off with her hand, she took the condom off and aimed my dick…at me. Like, straight back at me. I get it. She has a job to do. It (probably) wasn’t malicious. She just didn’t want to get messy. However, collateral damage on my end clearly wasn’t a concern of hers. Don’t get me wrong, it felt great, but when I’m by my lonesome I usually take measures to ensure I’m not my own blank canvas. So ensues another misfire, quite literally, in an awkward sexual encounter as I proceeded to spray myself machine-gun-style all over my own torso. There were a dozen places in the room I’d rather have done it, but closing my eyes like it was a fucking surprise party made it a good day for some friendly fire. 

 She smiles, hands me a towel, and says what I can only assume is Portuguese for “You just rocked my world.” Then she points to the clock. She was giving me the five-minute warning. We were already done because we had wasted so much time trying to get me hard.  I suppose it’s better than lasting 30 seconds for my first time. In the end I really don’t know if it was nerves or the porn. I’m guessing it was a little of both, but I psyched myself out way too much and the end result was a hot Brazilian woman trying to figure out what to do with an incredibly flaccid penis. So now I’ll always remember my first horribly awkward sexual encounter as one with someone who couldn’t get me hard and had no idea why because she didn’t speak English. 




TLDR; Accidentally picked an escort that spoke no English, couldn’t stay hard, and came all over myself when I finally could.

"TIFU By helping a guy not drown and trusting society.


I was out with a few friends last night for my 22nd birthday, we decided to head to a bar. I was walking along a canal with my girlfriend and another of our friends when we see a guy climbing from balcony to balcony that was overhanging the canal. We tried calling out to him but he seemed too drunk to notice. We stayed and watched and suddenly he dropped into the canal. I immediately started running to help him. I throw my wallet and phone on the top of the step going down to a grass area so I could jump in if needed. Luckily we got the attention of more people and managed to get a safety ring to one of them. 
Unfortunately when I went back to my phone and wallet someone had taken them both. I eventually managed to track the phone down with findmyiphone and the help of the police but the wallet seems to be gone forever.

Edit: Someone handed my wallet into the police station, I assume it has no cash left I in it but will be glad to get anything left. 
Edit 2: Wallet returned without the cash as expected but nothing overly much to worry about.
Edit 3: Yup should have gave my stuff to gf or friend, and all cards have been cancelled and the bank notified."

"TIFU by publicly accusing my fiancee of cheating on me


Ex-fiancee now. Throwaway because of how stupid I was.

I went away for a friend's bachelor party. We went to Nevada. My fiancee and I have been together for 2.5 years and our wedding is in 6 months. She told me her cousin Stacey was coming down for a week while I was gone.

So while I was in Nevada another friend of mine texts me that he had seen my girlfriend out with this guy. He figured she was probably a friend or something but this friend lives up the street from us and he said there was truck parked in my driveway. The next night he saw her go in with this guy and the guy stayed all night.

I told my girlfriend that we had decided to stay in Nevada for an extra two days but I went back early and I followed her and this guy to see for myself. She even told me on the phone she was with her cousin and didn't mention the guy at all. I took all the pictures my friend had taken after I asked him to and the ones I took and posted them on Facebook with her tagged and a message about her openly running around with this guy and him spending a bunch of nights at our house while I was away and how she was a liar and a cheat.

The guy was her cousin Stacey. Fucking everyone jumped all over me right after I posted. Stacey is a girl's name and I had no damn idea. Apparently I met him at some wedding before. She moved out and her sister who is a cop dropped the ring off."
"TIFU by forgetting I bought potatoes


Alright guys, this actually happened like an hour ago. Okay, so I buy groceries from week to week. As a single guy living alone, I usually just buy enough to last me the week. At some point in my multitude of grocery store trips, I bought a bag of potatoes. I think I may have used like one or maybe two potatoes from the entire bag before forgetting that I even bought them. Now, fast forward x amount of time (I can't remember how much time has passed since I bought them). At this point, I had been noticing a few gnats had been flying around apartment, to which I had no idea the cause. I am a relatively clean guy. I don't leave dishes or any puddles of water, and I have no plants (read online somewhere this attracts them). So, I buy some ribbon tape and notice it catches a few but the problem persisted. Anyway, I was making cereal in my kitchen and slicing bananas to put in my goddamn honey nut cheerios, and for whatever fucking reason I remember the potatos I bought way too fucking long ago, and I think, ""oh, i should throw them out. They are definitely not any good anymore"". So I open the cabinet where I keep my potatoes, and I was not prepared for what the fuck I was about to see. The potatoes had gone passed the point to where I don't think I could call them potatoes. There was this thick brown liquid stuff that had specs all over it that somehow made its way into my crock pot (forgot to mention crockpot is only other thing in the potato cabinet). As I opened the cabinet a plethora of gnats flew out and this unbearable stench was coming from the potatoes and brown liquid stuff. I immediately nope the fuck out and throw the potatoes and crock pot out in my apartment complex's dumpster. I come back in to examine the brown liquid stuff and to holy fucking hell, the specs on the brown liquid are larvae squirming around. I have never felt mmore gross or disgusting ...

TL;DR
I bought a bag of potatoes, forgot about them and it became a giant orgy breeding ground for gnats."
"TIFU and forgot that I am coffee's bitch...


Here I am at 12:59 am making coffee. Why? Because today I was so excited to have Ovaltine, that I forgot my morning caffeine intake and since I drank water for the rest of the day (the convenient work coffee machine not being close at hand), my body rebelled. My head started hurting this afternoon and by evening was absolutely raging. I raced home, trying to make it to my own personal toilet before vomiting from the pain. That didn't occur. Twice. Side of the road. Sorry potential future neighbors or friends. I cancelled my awesome go out tonight plans, took some headache meds, fell asleep, and then woke up with the head still wanting to kill me. I took some more excedrin to no avail. Then it dawned on me. Coffee! Now I'm sipping it and can feel the tension and pain draining from my body. Damn you liquid joy!"
"TIFU by failing a semester


My semester was going good and I was passing all my subjects then halfway through my grandmother died, because of this I found it really hard to concentrate and fell behind in my classes and ended up failing a semester.

Now I got an email saying that I have to withdraw from the faculty of science, I only needed 4 more courses to get my BSc. I am now preparing to submit an appeal and explain situation in 300 words.

TL;DR: My life just got screwed, grandmother died, failed classes and forced to withdraw from univeristy with a mountain of debt and several wasted years of my life. Trying to submit an appeal."
"TIFU by taking a laxative and ending up in the hospital for several days (where I still am).


Sorry to disappoint any folks, but believe it or not, this one doesn't involve any pants being shit. You can hit the back button now if you'd like, though there is some very mild talk about shit if that's what you came for.


So last week, starting on the Fourth of July, I was having some severe abdominal pain, fever, hot/cold sweats, headaches, etc. My self-diagnosis went from worst hangover of my life, to alcohol withdrawals, to kidney stones, for the next two days. The next day, I decided I was probably dumb and it was probably just constipation, which is something I have never experienced before, but have heard can be very painful. I had barely shit for several days, only some minor runs, so it made sense.


So I did what I thought made sense and I took a laxative.


A few hours later no pooping had occurred and the pain had strongly intensified, while also moving from just the middle of my abdomen and pelvis to the right side as well.


I decided constipation wasn't it so I did some further research. Based on my symptoms, it seemed that maybe I was having an appendicitis. I continued researching appendix issues and then began to freak out when I read that *taking laxatives can cause your appendix to burst.*

I freaked the fuck out and left my desk at work (after just returning from sick days) immediately and walked to the nearest hospital. I was sweating profusely and having a mild panic attack the entire way, and worse, my GPS wasn't working because of the tall buildings. I had to keep walking back and forth trying to find the hospital.

I finally found it and checked myself in to the ER and told them I needed an immediate appendectomy. 

They took blood and gave me an EKG scan and some other tests. Five hours later, they informed me I have diverticulitis (and that my colon ""pouches"" had ruptured).

So I've been here in the hospital since Thursday, without anything to eat or even a drop of water. 

I would (probably) much rather have had any of my other self-diagnoses be true, and would have gone to a much better hospital had I known I'd be staying this long. The ""FU"" in this case actually is probably a blessing, because at least now I finally know why I've been having so many stomach issues for the last *four* years.



Edit: Some people have pointed out that it may not be clear for some that diverticulitis is not a ruptured appendix. It is entirely different, and I stupidly dealt with it for over four years because I attributed it to other things like GERD, IBS, and alcohol. Don't do the same:

Also, I really hope my next post isn't ""TIFU by getting addicted to morphine because I FU and took a laxative and ended up in the hospital.""

Edit 2: Moved to a liquid diet. Water has NEVER tasted so good!

"TIFU in just about every way imaginable while babysitting


Like many fuckups, this did not happen today, but rather last Saturday. Anyway.

Last Saturday I was babysitting this six year old kid (let's call him Sean). Most of the night we watched Looney Toons and ate freezer pizza, and when we were winding down I helped him get ready for bed and brush his teeth. About this time I felt the pizza fighting a bloody battle with my colon and winning, so I gently shooed Sean out of the bathroom so I could take a dump. And oh, what a dump it was.

It smelled like Satan himself opened his asscrack and rained sulphurous fury down on a half-formed fetus covered in shit. So as I was wiping up and thanking my lucky stars the toilet didn't plug up (possibly the only thing that could have made this fiasco worse), I noticed something hanging over the shower curtain. It was a pair of black lingerie panties.

After furiously spraying Axe everywhere, I thought to myself ""Hey, I would be so embarrassed to come home to a clearly used bathroom and find that the babysitter saw my sexy panties. I'd better just put these away.""

So I grabbed them and that's when I saw... *they were wet.* I frantically reasoned that they were probably just damp from the shower, but upon closer inspection, no. They *smelled*. Now backtracking from my previously philanthropic gesture, I hurriedly went to chuck them in some corner of the master bedroom. Unfortunately, I was waylaid by Sean in his bed, calling for his monkey (I should point out now that Sean had a monkey instead of a bear, as did I growing up. I brought my monkey over so we could use them for whatever, but like I said we just ended up watching Looney Toons). I swiftly deposited the panties in what I gathered was the underwear drawer, then yelled ""think fast!"" and threw the monkey into his room.

This is where the real fuckup begins.

I heard a shriek from Sean's room, and turned on the light to see *the wet panties on his goddamn face.* I ran to the other room and got my monkey to quiet him, dancing it around and such, but that didn't help. So I said, ""If you stop crying now you can have a bowl of ice cream!"". It didn't help much but I heard a sniffly *okay*. I triumphantly returned to the kitchen to get a huge dollop of ice cream when I realized: Sean is one of those kids who's not allowed to have any sugar... and there was, surprise surprise, no ice cream. No matter, I said to myself, there's a store (the gas station type) just down the block, no more than two minutes' walk. So I told the kid I'd be back soon (big mistake), gave him a scrap of paper with my cell number and the home phone if anything happened.

A few minutes later I was triumphantly returning from the store with a drumstick in each hand, already starting on mine, when I saw *the parents' car in the driveway.* They were in the living room (the house didn't have a foyer or anything, just went straight to the living room from the front door) with an unattended, sobbing six year old clutching a pair of sex-soiled panties (and would soon find a fragrant bathroom and a monkey in the panties drawer), staring at me with ice cream on my face.

And I turned on my heel and left.

But about a minute later I realized something: I had left my monkey. The monkey I had since I was a year old, and I'd be damned if I lost it.

Thus followed the biggest walk of shame in my life, back to the house, prying a crying kid's fingers off a stuffed monkey. I never did get paid.

And that, Reddit, is why I'm never babysitting again.


**TL;DR I shat in a bathroom, threw used lingerie at a six year old, put a monkey in the panties, left to eat ice cream, and stole his teddy.**

Edit: A word. (damn mobile spellcheck)


Edit: A few clarifications:

1) the store was not far at all from the house, literally around 500 feet (it was on the same hill). I figured I could be there and back again in about a minute.

2) this also means that since in that small window I was gone the parents managed to come home, they were probably just up the hill as I was leaving. Just a quick glance left could have saved me.

3) also, the parents were very old family friends and I had babysat for them a couple times before without a hitch. I brought the monkey because the kid absolutely loved monkeys (and probably still does) so I didn't see any harm in it.

4) lastly, the parents were kind of hard-nosed prudes (like my mom) and would be embarrassed beyond measure to find that I had seen their sexy stuff (their embarrassment when I came home was matched only by their rage). The panties were also in a very obvious location (weird how their prude selves didn't hide that from their kid--maybe they didn't think he was old enough to understand).

Edit 5) I don't think the panties were wet from the sex per se, probably more likely that they were on the floor when someone got out of the shower, and when dripped on were... *activated*. But my stupid in-the-moment head resisted all reason and I was certain they were doin' the nasty seconds before meeting me at the door.

One last edit: It should be clear that I was not thinking straight through this entire fiasco. Who the fuck grabs soiled panties when they *are* thinking straight? (Actually, I don't want to know)"
