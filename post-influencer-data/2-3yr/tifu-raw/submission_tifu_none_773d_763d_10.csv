"TIFU by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.


So this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

Rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. She was exceptionally fine so I decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. Everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. We move onto the main course and I notice a more than offensive smell, Must've dug up something deep. So I finish her and end the night.

A day later and my throat is sore, but I think nothing of it as I was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

Two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. I go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins I see the doctor. With a look of concern on his face, he tells me I need to go to the ER. 'The ER?' I asked 'is it really that bad?' The doc asks me how long it's been hurting and I told him I had just noticed it today. He tells me it's very Aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. So I head down to the ER to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. He finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

A script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and I'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the ER for tonsilitis.

Edit:

Fun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)

And since I finally made it to the front page, hi Mom.."
"TIFU By Burning My Right Eye Retina After Looking At Solar Eclipse.


Well... not today but about 20 years ago. I was young teenager in a summer camp and did not know any better. I looked at the sun through my partially closed fist (to reduce aperture) with my right eye. I have a small spot in my right eye that kinda static (like TV static). Whenever I take eye exam (reading letters), I have a very hard time reading letters with my right eye (because of the burned spot).

I have since got LASIK (I had a slightly bad vision) and my right eye came out slightly worse than the left. All because we could not get acurate reading (I kept screwing up reading part).

Burned eye retina, like mine, is incurable and inoperable. I will have to live with this all my life. It's not bad enough that would render me disabled, just annoying sometimes. 

Please watch out for kids looking at the eclipse. They will see that all adults look at the sky and do the same. That is what I did. 

Please be aware of eye protection tomorow.

TL;DR burned my right eye retina looking at the solar eclipse and now can not pass eye exam. 

Edit : since evrybody asking. I've looked at it for around 30 min. It was partial eclipse. 

Edit 2: jeez, so many of you replying with the same experience. This issue needs to be better explained to the public, maybe tought in schools. "

"TIFU by farting in the direction of my CPAP and getting a pressurized dutch oven


Last night was my second night using a CPAP. A CPAP pressurizes room air and feeds the air to a face mask to treat sleep apnea. Early on this morn, I was awoken with the familiar post taco bell gas pressure. Wanting to quickly go back to sleep, I gave it a push while laying on my side and away it went. I began to drift off to sleep when something paranormal began filling the pressurized mask which was covering my nose and mouth. I immediately regcognized the brand to be of my own as it began to smother me like a CIA Agent waterboarding a terrorist. I am notorious for making a room uninhabitable with my gas. The sound of my farts frequently wake my wife. Once the smell of a fart woke my at the time girlfriend and thus was unsure if it would be worse if I took the mask off. I either went back to sleep or passed out, not clear which. 

TL;DR TIFI when I farted next to my CPAP and was smothered in pressurized fart"
"TIFU By melting a hole in my solar eclipse glasses with a beam of focused super-light from binoculars.


I want to preface this by saying I'm okay, no catastrophic eye damage to me or my father.

We aren't in the path of totality, but we still bought a few pairs for viewing. Now I'd like to say I thought I'd be one of the smart ones this time around, but looks like I almost bought a one way ticket to Stupidville.

As we were watching it, I got the bright idea (Pun definitely intended) of grabbing my binoculars and trying to see through with the eclipse glasses. So I put the glasses on first, then brought the binoculars up to my eyes. Took a minute to find the sun, but eventually I did and it was awesome! We could see some sunspots and the lines were so crisp and clear! It was pretty cool, so I let my dad give it a go as well.

As I took a second turn, I noticed my right eye felt irregularly hot. I brushed it off, especially since the binoculars favored the left lense for viewing. Once I was done looking I took the binoculars off and noticed my grave error; THE LENSE OF THE BINOCULARS MADE A BEAM OF CONCENTRATED SUPER-LIGHT THAT MADE A HOLE IN THE GLASSES THAT ALMOST FRIED ME LIKE A LIGHTSABER TO THE RETINA.

I threw the glasses off my face and look down from the sun and we both checked our eyes for ghosting images. Thankfully, we were both fine! But looking back, I nearly became one of the people I laughed at so naively.

[Proof](https://m.imgur.com/PpVZr0q)

TL;DR Used solar eclipse glasses with binoculars which melted a hole through the UV filter, almost disintegrating my corneas

UPDATE: Woke up this morning and... I'm fine. It's been approximately 16 hours since the incident. No discomfort, pain or spots. I think I'm in the clear for now. My right eye *was* closed for a significant part. I think I'd know if that super-light was in my eye even for a second. Thanks for all of your concern!"
"TIFU by thinking I killed my girlfriend with weed


In true TIFU fashion, this happened mid last year.

A little background first.
I met this girl June last year and a month later we were 'officially' together. Things were fantastic and we bonded so well. Over the months preceding the 'incident', I gathered that she had had relatively little experience when it came to drugs. I myself am not big into the drug scene, but at the time I did try pot every now and then. We had shared a joint or two in the past, and I decided that we should celebrate the end of high school by smoking a bong at her house. Not my brightest idea, as her mother was not a fan of any drugs.

So on that fateful Friday, I acquired a bong and a pretty strong strain of ganja. Her mother was a really heavy sleeper so we waited until she fell asleep on the sofa and then went out the back garden. We lit up, I took two hits and she took the same. Things seemed okay and we both began to feel the effects after about 5 minutes. The giggles set in a little and we were good. 

Then she stood up, freaked out about getting caught, stood still, told me she couldn't see, and fucking dropped. I thought she had died then and there. 
Thankfully I caught her in time and, even while stoned, my first aid training kicked in. When I laid her down on the ground, her eyes were open and she was unresponsive. Literally looked dead. Thankfully she came about quite quickly. It didn't end there.

She started freaking the fuck out. Wide-eyed, high heart rate and the likes. She was insisting that I call an ambulance and get her to the hospital. This was a classic white out as she had a relatively strong hit compared to her weight (I'm 115kg and two hits does it for me, she's 65kg). I said that she'll be okay, that it wasn't anything major. She started shaking violently and couldn't muster the strength to sit up from the concrete, still insisting on the ambulance. My stoned self was starting to panic and she continued to insist on the ambulance as her panic levels increased. I eventually obliged, certain that I was going to be hung, drawn and quartered by her mother. The ambulance arrived not too long after I called, lights on but siren off (we asked them to do this in the phone- legends). I thought all was good, but then her dog started to bark in the room her mother was sleeping. Damnit Shadow.

I went inside to try and shut the dog up. As I picked him up and petted him, her mother woke up and looked at me. I felt like my soul was being torn from my body. I smiled and said I was calming the dog down, and she just closed her eyes and went back to sleep. Phew. I went out the back and the paramedics walked through the back gate laughing. I explained what happened, and they said it was okay and that she will be okay. I was relieved but still terrified that her mother would wake up to see her only daughter being prodded and examined by paramedics. Guess what? She did. 
I awkwardly said hi, and she asked what was going on.

My heart nearly exploded. 

My girlfriend and I looked at eachother, then to the paramedics, we had no idea what they would say. Then the paramedic, Sarah (I will never forget that name) said ""just low blood sugar, had a bit of a fainting spell. Nothing to worry about really!""
I nearly hugged her, I was so relieved. 
After they left, we all went inside, talked about what happened and  slept soundly. 
I guess this fuck up had a wholesome, happy ending. Hopefully a nice change for you guys.
However, my girlfriend (who I am still with - one year and counting!) can never look, smell or smoke weed again. Even thinking about it makes her anxious. 
I had PTSD-like flashbacks for four days after the incident. Probably won't smoke again.


**tl;dr** Smoked a bong with my bong-virgin girlfriend of four months at her anti-drug household. She chucked a whitey, thought she was dead. Paramedics saved our hides by telling her mother it was low blood sugar. A wholesome ending, I guess?

edits: better tl;dr and CPR on the English no 

edit2: jeez I go to sleep and wake up with gold.
 Thank you kind stranger!

edit3: guy, I know pot can't kill, calm down "
"TIFU by adding a secret ingredient to dinner


Obligatory this wasn't today... More of a YIFU (...with my WIFU)

So my wife and I have been doing Hello Fresh, and I've been getting some really good practice cooking. It's super awesome.

Then, today happened.

It all started when I cracked open the bag. I poured (which I never do) the contents of the bag out on the counter, and the tiny mayonnaise jar falls on the ground and the bottom shatters.

""That's one way to open it,"" I thought. I picked it up and set it on the counter for later.

Time passes, I have seared the fish for our tacos, peeled the carrots for our slaw, and it's time to add the mayonnaise to the slaw. I turn the jar over and start shaking out all the mayo I can into this slaw. Vigorously.

Fast forward again... I've pulled out the fish and cut it up for the tacos; started adding fish, slaw, and sour cream to the tortillas; toss a lime on each plate and serve it to my beautiful wife.

I stepped away for a moment to grab some things to work with after we're done eating, and when I come back, my wife says, ""Everything tastes really good, but there's this really sandy stuff in it."" We proceeded to have a full conversation about what could possibly be causing that. I added sugar to the slaw, maybe the fish was a little charred, maybe we got a weird batch of tortillas.

No. No. No.

Then my wife pulls something out of her mouth. ""It's really gritty!""

It was the glass.

We ate glass.

Tl;dr - Broke a jar of mayo, made fish and glass tacos."
"TIFU by calling a woman a watermelon


This happened several months ago, but the aftermath of this FU haunts me almost every day at work. It was a normal day of work, and one of the gals I work with wore a lime green shirt and bright pink pants (totally different from the normal black and blue I see all the time). I remember seeing her early on in the day and thinking she looked ready for spring/summer, but thought nothing more at the time. Later in the day, I was walking down a hall when she turned the corner, and in an effort to avoid the normal ""How are you today,"" I instead blurted out the first thing that came to mind...which was ""Hey! You look like a watermelon today!"" My heart sank as I instantly realized our work relationship would never be the same, and I had possibly permanently scarred her tender heart. She looked both surprised and horrified at what I had said, and passed by without saying anything. We've barely spoken since then, probably because she's worried what kind of fruit I'm going to call her next. She has not worn the same colors together since. 

TL;DR: I called a female co-worker a watermelon after she wore green and pink to work. Her self-esteem was clearly hurt, and our work relationship remains awkward as ever. "
"TIFU by stopping my dog from staring at the eclipse.


This happened yesterday, of course.
I have 4 dogs, but the one in this story is a 1 year old bulldog who weighs about 60 pounds.
Bella is a curious dog, and she spends a lot of time looking out the window.
So when the eclipse was about to begin, I closed the curtains in order to prevent having another blind dog, and all was well. 
That's when a small crowd a couple houses down starts cheering as the moon passes the sun. Bella's ears perk up and she starts to sprint towards the couch so she can look out the window. I spring into action and snatch her up. She excitedly swings her legs around and clocks me right across the face with her freshly clipped nails.
Ouch.
Now I have 2 slash marks across my face. Thanks Bella.
That wasn't enough for the bloodlusted pup, as she then kicked me right in the balls with a vicious stomp.
More ouch.

In hindsight I realize she probably wouldn't have even looked at the sun...

Edit: I realized how stupid this was about 3 seconds after I did it. No need to remind me.

Edit2: TIFU by posting to TIFU.

Edit3: TIL reddit is mean, thanks for showing love to the nice users.

Edit:4 Gold? WHAT? THANK YOU MYSTERIOUS MAN! 


Tl:dr, stopped my dog from going blind, dog assaulted me.

"TIFU by water boarding some birds


This happened last night. My mom is away for a week and she wanted me to water some of her flowers for her. The flowers are hanging in baskets [similar to this](http://balconygardenweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Million-Bells-in-hanging-basket.jpg) from hooks in the ceiling of the veranda.

Now I need to preface this, my Mom has had these flowers out all summer. As it happens, a month and a half or so ago, some birds decided to make a nest in there. The birds are probably some kind of finch, or at least they're no [bigger than this guy.](http://www.jessupaviary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Teddy-7.9-mellow.jpg) My Mom was always terrified to water the plants because she didn't want to get dive bombed, so we moved the plant further down the porch, and only watered it when the birds were gone. When the plant wasn't hanging (or if you're tall enough I guess) The nest and eggs were easy to see through the flowers, but when it's hanging it's anybody's guess what's in there. So here's where I fucked up.

So I've been watering these plants every second day for a few days now, and some of them are starting to wilt. I figure I haven't been watering them quite enough, so this time I'm really going to pour some water in there. As I'm making my rounds, I realize that there's a plant further down the porch that I hadn't noticed or watered all weekend. So I went down, got on my tippy toes, and poured that watering can solidly into the plant.

 First second, everything is fine. By second 2, the flower is starting to ruffle in a panic, but my brain doesn't quite register what's going on. Second 3, two birds flop out of the flowers and onto the deck, one after the other. They're dazed and weren't able to fly out of the plant, and are quickly trying to get their bearings and assess the situation, all the while squeaking like mad men. 4, Thud. A fledgling bird literally and audibly thuds onto the deck. By contrast, the parents landed like cats. By this time I'm fully registering what's happening, and I want to help the fledgling back into its nest if I can, except that 5. Mom and Dad have gotten back on their feet, their wings mostly working, and they're pissed. Squeaking loudly, they started hopping and flapping around, not quite able to fly from standing. Jr rolls off the deck in an attempt to get on his feet. This was the last I saw of Jr. 6, Mom manages to get up on the railing, while dad is on my car ~8 feet away. They are mostly postured around where Jr fell, but they are very aware of me and react when I try to get close. They are in fight AND flight mode, scared but not quite ready to commit to a full retreat. 

This all took about 6 or 7 seconds. It was at this time I'm sad to say, that I decided it was best if I left. Where the fledgling had fallen was behind some shrubbery, and as I went down the deck to look for him, I couldn't see him anywhere (must have waddled off) and it seemed I was stressing the parents by looking. I figured(hoped really) if they had some time to group with Jr they'd be fine. Jr's wings were mostly in, he only barely looked juvenile compared to his parents, so I hope he was able to fly back into his nest. 

I hadn't seen the birds in a few weeks and totally forgot about them before watering. There was 3 eggs in the past when we looked at the nest a month ago, so I'm really hoping only Jr survived to babyhood, or else I have 2 more birds drowned on my conscience. Sorry Bird's :(

**TL;DR:** Forgot about a nest and accidentally water boarded an unsuspecting family of birds.

**EDIT:** Just got home from work, so wanted to give you guys a quick update. For those of you concerned about the other 2 eggs, [There were no bird corpses,](http://imgur.com/a/AtcHu) so presumably they didn't hatch or they left the nest before Jr. I also haven't seen or heard the birds since then."
"TIFU by taking a dump on the side of a mountain and breaking my nose as a result.


*Happened a couple months ago, but still worth sharing. 

We all do dumb stuff when we’re tired. Especially when it’s the middle of the night and we need to relieve ourselves. And even more so when we’re out in the deepest part of the woods, on a camping trip, and have an itty-bitty fear of the dark. 

Imagine, if you will, the tiniest of camp clearings set into the side of a mountain. One cut into a wooded slope so steep, you wonder just how far you’d roll if you took even the smallest misstep. Now imagine it’s dark as sin in the dead of night, with just enough moonlight to see the outlines of everything. That’s what I awoke to in my tent, with Nature’s Calling roiling in my gut.

Stumbling out of my tent in PJ bottoms, gripping nothing but some toilet paper and my flashlight, I began looking around for the nearest latrine. There wasn’t one. It was too steep. Not wanting to foul up our campsite, I decided to clamber up the slope a little bit and fertilize the trees above us. Keep in mind, I wasn’t really thinking straight. Just a zombie with a need for the drains. 

I pulled myself up the slope, slipping on dead leaves all along the way. I got about forty feet up and decided I was good. There I squatted, took care of business, made sure I was dirt-free, and sluggishly began slogging back down the slope.

Something rustled behind me. It was approaching fast, running over the leaves at a rapid pace, coming straight toward me. Adrenaline cut through my foggy state in seconds and warning signs flashed in my vision: DANGER! ANIMAL! KILL YOU! RUN!

I bolted down the hill, yelling at the top of my lungs, slipping, sliding, almost tumbling through the trees. The rustling continued after me, hot on my heels. My friend, who’d been sleeping soundly, was up and out of his tent in a flash, shining his light in my direction as I slid toward him with my pants around my knees and screaming for help. 

Now the edge of our little campsite is dug into the slope, so there’s a bit of a drop off. I slid off it at high velocity, hit the ground hard, and ended up slamming my face into the ground, breaking my goddamn nose. My friend wasn’t paying attention to me though. He stood over me, the rustling abundantly clear in the night air as he shined his light around to pick out the threat. 

I hunkered at his feet, crying and shivering, my nose dripping blood and mucus from where I’d busted it. Then the threat made itself known. A brown mass slid off the embankment and dropped right on top of our tent, almost caving it in. Immediately, the smell followed--pungent and revolting, with a hint of trail mix. Even through my busted nose, which was now clogged with blood, I got a good whiff. It slid down our tent for a good ten seconds, before flopping to the ground. 

My friend held his flashlight on it the entire damn time, then shined it down at me. Then he doubled over laughing, not caring about my busted nose or that he’d been so rudely awakened. After I took care to bundle my nose a bit, we began to figure out what happened. 

Apparently, the deuce I’d dropped on the hill possessed just the right amount of density and viscosity to begin sliding down the slope and not break apart. The embankment, slick with dead leaves, afforded the perfect conditions for it to stalk me all the way back down to my campsite. I never heard the end of it, my friend called me Little Brown Sliding Hood from then on, and we had to head out early to attend to my goddamn nose.

So for any campers out there, if you shit in the woods, make sure it’s not on a hill. And if it is, dig a hole first. 

TL;DR: I took a shit on a hill, it rolled down after me, I thought it was a wild animal chasing me, and ended up breaking my nose as well as earning the nickname “Little Brown Sliding Hood” for the rest of the trip. "
"TIFU By Laughing Out Loud at Reddit and then ""Pranking"" my Little Sis


Traditional this didn't happen today, well... part of it... here we go:

So about 1 yr ago I was sitting at a table with my family(including extended family so a lot of people talking loudly) and me being younger than most and also not drunk I was browsing Reddit. I stumbled across the post where everyone upvoted so that when you google Comcast a picture of a swastika came up. You guys know what I'm talking about. So when I read this I laughed hysterically, but my then 8-yo little sister was sitting next to me and saw the swastika that I laughed at. She asked me what it was and so naturally, I told her it was the international symbol for world peace. Yeah. All was well until today, when my sister saw the Nazi's on the news this morning(now 9 yo). Upon seeing their signs and shit she was reminded of the ""international symbol for world peace"" and began to draw it. At school. Yeah. So my parents got a call, had a nice little chat with my sister(who was in trouble at school for telling MORE children that a swastika is the ""international symbol for world peace"" leading to more innocent kids drawing swastikas), and apparently for the past year she has thought that a swastika means peace. My parents asked where she got the idea and she told them. I am posting this in bed, grounded, after accidentally(and indirectly) teaching a 3rd grade class that drawing swastikas is a good thing.

TL;DR: I told my little sister that a swastika is the ""international symbol for world peace"" and it came back to bite me a yr later when she taught her 3rd grade class the same thing.

Edit: Just to clarify I am not a Nazi

Edit 2: Wow thx for all the up votes and comments! Didn't expect it to blow up like this! To everyone that mentioned the origin of the swastika I tried bringing that to my parents and they didn't buy it... they think I intended to teach it to her as a Nazi symbol. Still grounded."
"TIFU by getting stuck in a cock cage


Before I begin, I'm a male who has been seeing guys lately.

I have started seeing this guy who is a cop and rather dominate. We were chatting one night about our sexual experiences and things that turn each other on. He explained rather delicately that Cock Cages are a big turn on for him, and then showed me a few that he had. Verbally I was like ""Oh, yeah! That's really cool!"" but mentally I was like ""Who would do that."" He really wanted me to try it on, I was hesitant but curious. We were playing with the idea of it all, and he wanted me to keep it on while I went home, and as I was seeing him the next night we would take it off then. Through that night though, something happened with his family and he didn't think twice and went to see his family on the other side of the country, he caught the earliest flight... leaving me with a cage around my cock and him with the key... he was really apologetic and will be back ASAP.

That was two days ago, now I'm scoping for a lock smith (*cock smith) or someone who can help out of this restriction.
I just want my dick and freedom back.

TL;DR Dick stuck in a cage and I can't get it out, the guy who has the key is on the other side of the country due to a family Emergency

"TIFU by forgetting the word ""vacuum""


Obligatory this didn't happen today. Also, keeping this short, cause I'm tired of thinking how I go to work to be called ""Dyson.""

So, I was at work a few days ago, in what was a general day working at a grocery store. My store manager tells me that we have auditors coming, and asked me to use the store's handheld vacuum to clear our coolers of flies (flies typically fly onto coolers in grocery stores and then can't fly off due to the cold air, causing a health hazard if not taken care of, which is bad for business and the future of my employment).

The vacuum is stored in a department that isn't my own, so I had to make my way across the store in order to pick it up; thus I make my way to said department.

I manage to make it to the department just fine, but I figured out that my burden was more than just physically making it to the department.

I cross through the double doors, and I see the one manager in the store that I have next to no interactions with. When she looked at me, I suddenly couldn't figure out the word for ""vacuum."" Even though I could see the thing, sitting on its portable charger. All my social anxiety-infused, awkward, introverted brain could think was ""that's the thing that sucks stuff up.""

Thus, with an uncharacteristic enthusiasm and confidence, I told the department manager ""I need the suck.""

Without waiting for a response, I picked up the vacuum, jetted out, and hoped to never see her face again. Later on, one of the manager's associates came and asked me if I had a thing for her, and asked me if I knew she was married.

TL;DR My married manager now has suspicions that I want a blowie from her, I just needed the suck machine."
