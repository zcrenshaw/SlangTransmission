"TIFU By Farting During Mass and Making the Priest Laugh


This actually happened about an hour ago. I'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

So...I'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when I feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

No biggie, this has happened before, I'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. But alas, my body had other plans.

We stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, I'm starting to panic, not sure if I can hold it. We finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as I land on the pew...

IT HAPPENED!

Now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel's trumpet.

The church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

The priest stands up at his chair, says ""I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.

At this point I decide it's a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

TL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church. "
"TIFU by petting a cute little cygnet (baby swan). [NSFW]


""This didn't happen today"". I am new here, thought it'd be cool to share it here. Brace.

I was an 11 year old kid back then and I liked to pet animals on the first sight of 'em (still do). My parents were making plans to visit the beautiful small village where my father grew up. To Spend a few days and come back. My father warned me a lot about various short tempered animals and birds in there, especially swans. And of course little me didn't pay any attention. I was too busy to fantasize about the cows and goats and sheep (in a platonic way).

So there I was, terrorizing the whole village's wild life (kinda domesticated I guess). Apparently they didn't like to be touched constantly by a stupid kid. By the second day every damn cow, hen, goat, and sheep was running away by the sight of me -praying for my premature death. The crows lost their privacy and peace. They all conspired against me and it worked.

On the morning of the fourth day I went alone to the edge of a big pond on the outskirts of the village and discovered one of the nests of some local swans. Some (3-4) cygnets were playing around it and didn't mind me coming near 'em. One, especially friendly cygnet came near me out of curiosity and I picked it up from the ground in a gentle manner. It was chubby, cute, and warm. As I was looking over the pond while sunbeams touched my face through the red edge of the clouds - the swan mother arrived from the pond with two fully spread wings. I thought she was coming to congratulate me for being the new David Attenborough / disney princess of the village.

The swan went straight for my baby maker and grabbed a mouthful with her beak. I've never received a blowjob till now but her job blew my fucking soul out of my body. The clouds turned black and the sun went dark. Those who think nut hitting is worse than childbirth should try a swan sometimes. I was in great pain. Her wings hit me hard on the rib cage and knees and the silly cunt cygnet enjoyed the whole show from my arms. After 30 or so seconds of agony and Russian Ballet I was finally able to disengage the bastard from my penis. I quickly put down the baby and ran for home.

My upper trousers were soaked in blood. My mother nearly fainted by the sight of me. I just told my father ""swan!""... he quickly grabbed me up from the ground and ran for the doctor's house. I got two stitches on my nutsack and one on the penis and lots of ointments for the bruises on my chest, hands, and knees. The doctor told me that the cygnet saved my face because I was holding it near my face. The mother swan would never attack near her baby. My right seminal duct was nearly chopped off but apparently my blood soaked jeans saved it. 

My asshole sister who never misses a chance, asked me after I came home from the doctor's, ""First period huh? Tell me about it."".


TL;DR : Mother-swan nearly chopped off my balls when I picked up her baby."

"TIFU by being faster than my puppy.


Earlier today I was playing with my 4 month old Jack Russel  Cross Terrier puppy in the living room floor; rolling around, playing tug of war, him going nuts as he chases me etc. I decided to sit down to rest a bit and let him exert his enormous ball of energy at the tug rope on the floor, but suddenly he spies something. 

He looks. 
I look. 

He spots a shiny piece of something.
I spot the shiny piece of something. 

Now obligatory explanation monologue; for anyone who has not owned a dog, a puppy at this age jumps at anything with it's mouth as its hands to investigate. As this was a delicate period of my puppy, since he had a bad case of diarrhea a day ago and is now on antibiotics, I was on full alert to haul ass to stop him digesting anything bad.

As I saw the little shit spin up his gears to jump, I grabbed it with first finger and thumb. I felt a searing pain. I dropped whatever it was I grabbed and yelped, bewildering my puppy who was now frozen. As I looked at my now bleeding finger and thumb, I realized that the shiny object was in fact a shard of glass. A flashback hits me.

Just yesterday night my father had dropped my food weighing scale made out of glass.... he missed a fragment in the clean up.

At least I saved my puppy from possible death.

TL;DR : Cut myself picking up a shard of glass on the floor before my puppy could grab it and ingest it.

Edit 1: no longer ""4 month year old"" :)

Edit 2: ""haul ass""

Update 1; i think i really fucked up today. Just came back from the vet with my baby. Was playing with him and accidentally kicked him as he jumped at my shoe to play. He yelped and whined as i picked him up. When he was calm,as i put him down, he fell flat on his face and held his right paw up, and couldn't walk.

Vet said it must just be sore or sprained as theres still range of motion. So he was given painkillers for now.

I feel like shit. I might post another tifu but right now it feels like i just disabled my own child.

Update 2: Hes OKAYYYYY YAYYY. Was walking this morning but will be on more drugs for a bit more. Will make a new post later."
"TIFU by doing a nazi salute on a class photo


As most stories, this didn't happen today but rather ~7 months ago.

Let's give this story a little background.

I was in a school obsessed with dabbing. My classmates did it everywhere, and even the teachers dabbed once in a while.
Me, being the rebel I was, absolutely hated this. I thought it was ""cancerous"", and only used it to mock others. Alright, enough background.

.

It was a sunny day when all the grades' classphotos were taken. The photographer would announce the class, the class would position outside right next to our school and the pic would get taken.

After about 20 minutes of waiting, our class got called outside. We aligned ourselves how the photographer wanted us to, and he took the photo. Now something I haven't told you, is that at our school the photographers always take 2 pictures: one serious one, and one ""joke"" photo. On these joke photos the students would usually freak out and do some weird shit.
As you might already imagine, on the joke photo, everyone was dabbing. Me, being the 16 year old rebel I was, I decided I wouldn't give in to their bullshit. But I also didn't want my classmates to kill me afterwards for standing out in the picture.

So... I decided to do a nazi salute. Dumb idea, right? Not in my mind. At least back then. I was in the last row, I tilted my head slightly, and did a nazi salute. I knew it would look like a dab from afar, so I rolled with it. The photographer took the photo, and so I assumed he didn't notice. At least my classmates didn't notice.

.

When the yearbook which included all of the class's classphotos was published, no one seemed to notice. No one seemed to notice my nazi salute on the pictures hanging on the classroom door. My nazi salute was almost invisible, and you could only see it when you really looked for it.

About two weeks after the class photos were published, people started to notice. They would stop by our class door and look at me. And my nazi salute. Eventually, the teachers knew about it, and I got called into the headmaster's office.

He wasn't too happy. My parents got called, they (obviously) weren't too happy about the burst of my nazi-genes (that's what the headmaster called my nazi dab. Seriously.) I got suspended for two weeks, and when I was back in the school... the class-photo was gone, and most of my classmates hated me. A few of my friends found it hilarious (so did I), but it was forbidden for me to talk about it.

TLDR: Did a nazi-salute instead of a dab, got suspended, classmates hated me, parents mad, shitty schoolyear. 

Edit: Expelled =/= Suspended

"TIFU by eating expired chicken tenders


At my job, we serve chicken tenders and fries, among other things. They come in a box and sometimes we pre-make them before rushes and put them under a heat lamp for people to grab. After they've been sitting for 45 minutes, they are considered expired and are supposed to be thrown away. It is against corporate policy to eat the expired food and it must be thrown away. 

Pfffft. As if we're all going to do that. 

Now granted, I'm a manager, so I should be enforcing that rule, but it's supposedly for our own safety, so if people are willing to put the risk on themselves, so be it? 

I've been warned by a superior a couple times not to eat it, but usually the conversation goes: 

Her: ""You paid for that right?"" 

Me: ""Yeah of course"" 

And then we laugh and go on with our days because nobody really cares about 10 minute expired chicken tenders right? 

Cue, the new General Manager. 

I'm eating expired tenders in the office with him and the other superior I usually joke about it with. We're talking about some other work related item even though I'm on my break and not supposed to be doing any work whatsoever. She heads home for the night. The moment the door shuts behind her, new GM swings around in his chair. 

Him: ""You get those tenders from a restaurant?"" 

Me: ""Oh no they're from our stand."" 

Him: ""Oh ok. They any good?"" 

Me: ""Yeah they're pretty good. Think they've been getting better since we've been detail cleaning the fryer even more regularly."" 

Him: ""That's cool. Did you pay full price for them?"" 

Me (thinking this is part of the joke): ""Oh you know we get our discount and all that."" 

Him: ""That's weird. I don't see your name on the list of employee discounts for the day."" In my head I'm thinking, damn he's taking this joke pretty far. 

Me: ""Well I thought I paid for them, if I didn't I can go do that right now."" 

Him: ""How do you not know?"" I get nervous at this point. 

Me internally: ""What the fuck is happening"" 

Me out loud: ""Uh well I mean maybe something happened and the transaction got cancelled I don't know I'll go pay right now."" 

Him: ""What do you mean the transaction got cancelled? Did you pay or did you not?"" 

Me: ""UHHH I thought I did but I'll go pay now!"" 

Him: ""So if I look at the cameras from a few minutes ago, I'm going to see you pulling out your card and trying to pay for these chicken tenders?"" 

Me: .... 

Him: .... 

Me: ""Okay I don't know why I'm lying right now. They're expired. I know we're not supposed to eat them."" 

He went on to describe how lying isn't something he's going to tolerate then stormed out of the room. I lost my appetite and threw away the chicken tenders in the office trash can. Fifteen minutes later he called me back into the office, took my keys and fired me. 

To make matters worse, I carpooled with my roommate this day, and had to wait for him to get off in six hours; plenty of time to mull over losing my job for eating expired chicken tenders and fibbing my way into oblivion.

TLDR: I ate expired chicken tenders and lied to my new boss about it. He fired me."
"TIFU by almost killing my father-in-law, while simultaneously destroying a $2000 piece of equipment


As per usual, this was a few years ago.  

I worked for a small landscape contractor and nursery as a laborer/salesman/mechanic/whatever else they wanted me to do.  We had a moderately sized (11 acres) property where we grew Christmas trees.  The trees were prone to getting spiders and praying mantis nests, as well as bagworms, so we would spray the nursery once a year with a very potent insect spray.  

The way we did that was to take our wheel loader (think a giant forklift with big tires that turns in the middle) and load a spray tank with a gas engine and a hose on the front, and hoist it and someone to use it up above the trees so they could spray the nursery.  

Before we continue, a word about my father-in-law, the foreman of this little outfit.  He was the kind of guy not scared by anything, and also the kind who did everything himself.  Basically, for this job he didn't trust anyone else to spray the nursery effectively.  He also didn't trust any of the other workers to drive the wheel loader well, so that became my job.

We pulled this off successfully for years, but it always scared the hell out of me, because he would end up 10+ feet in the air just holding onto the end of the machine, with no regard for his own safety.  OSHA would have had a field day with us.

This particular year, we had just gotten a new machine to do the spraying, with a much higher capacity tank, and a fancy electric reel to pull the hose back after you had extended it.  

We did our thing, spraying and moving around the nursery, until we got to a section that always freaked me out because it was uneven and made everything sway back and forth.  

We hit that spot fine, but he signals me he wants to go higher to get a couple trees so we don't have to double back.  No problem, I raise him a little, and inch forward.

Right into a ditch.  

It wasn't a bad one, but the height coupled with the angle the forks were at caused the new spray tank and reel to rock forward, to the point where they almost fell off.  I should point out that its cradle had no bottom slats, so it was just resting on the forks instead of being supported all
around.  

I angled the forks back so cradle the tank, which normally would do the trick.  Problem was, the water inside the tank was rocking back and forth, and when I angled the forks back almost all of the weight was beyond them, which instead of catching the tank, had the effect of flipping it like a diver off a diving board.  The tank came crashing to the ground upside down, right on the brand new hose reel.  Literally an hour into using it and already destroyed.

As I'm lamenting the equipment, my father-in-law has been screaming and yelling at me, for what I think is dropping the tank.  

So I look up.

Nope, he's holding onto the forks for dear life.  He lost his balance when the tank went over, and my overcorrection with the forks made him lose footing completely, so he's hanging like Doc Brown from *Back to the Future* off the end of the machine.

So I panic, thinking ""shit, if I drop him I'll have to tell my wife I broke her dad"", so I try to lower him down.  As i do, the forks tilt forward, causing him to slide forward off the end and land square on his ass .  Luckily the distance was much shorter by then, but it still looked like it hurt.  He took one look at me, with fury in his eyes.  I'm expecting a lecture or a stream of cursing, or worse.

He says, and I quote: 

""Neither of our wives hears about this.""  

Knew right then I was actually part of the family.  Several days and one large repair bill later, and we're no longer spraying the nursery like that.


TL;DR:  Spraying a tree nursery with a guy and a water tank lifted on a machine to its max height, hit a ditch and dropped the tank and the guy.  Guy happens to be father-in-law, who also happens to be boss.  Didn't get fired, but cost the company several thousand dollars and myself some embarrassment.  Upside, in a weird way bonded with the Father-in-law.

EDIT: a for people have asked for pics to help with visualizing this story, so [here](http://www.kubpower.net.au/listings/new-r30-series-wheel-loaders/) is a picture of the machine I was driving (minus the bucket up front).

And [here](http://m.northerntool.com/products/shop~tools~product_200329207_200329207?hotline=false) is a picture of the poor doomed tank and reel.

"TIFU by snuggling with my cat

"TIFU by using google autofill and being convinced that I was secretly a woman


My wife and I have been trying to conceive for a long time. Years actually. No reason why really, but as we investigated, we started with the assumption that she was infertile.

It took about a year of so for her to run all the tests, see all the various doctors, run all the possibilities to ground before we knew definitively she was not the issue.

So I got my semen tested and learned I was effectively infertile. I was producing such a low amount of sperm that it would be impossible to impregnate someone. Also found out that my testosterone levels were very low.

So the investigation continued. The next step was to get hormonal testing done and an ultra sound on my junk, etc. Then I would bring the results to the urologist.

First, a little about myself. I am in my 20s, have competed in several Iroman races, done dozens of triathlons, race bikes competitively, run 20+ miles a week. I like sports and am very competitive. I have a lot of muscle. Look like a lacrosse player. I consider myself pretty manly.

So I never once thought I wasn’t a man.

But I was at my desk at work when my general practitioner sent me the lab results. I immediately started pouring through them, googling terms I didn’t know to figure out what it all meant. I am a huge WebMD user so this was right up my ally.

Well come to the karyotype. The report indicated I have KARYOTYPE 46 XY. No idea what this meant, but I knew it had to do with chromosomes and I knew it was important.

So I quickly typed it into google, looking around as I did it to ensure no one was watching (we sit in open cubicles). I saw the Google search bar auto populate and I hit enter.

Google had auto populated KARYOTYPE 47 XXY. Close enough for me not to catch the error. The first link was a wiki article on the XXY chromosome, otherwise known as Klinefelter syndrome.

I begin reading and the first sentence tells me the primary feature is sterility. I thought, ok that checks out. Goes on to say symptoms are subtle and people don’t realize they are affected for many years, ok that checks out because I haven’t noticed anything yet and am in my 20s

Continue reading, other symptoms include man breasts. I haven't been working out that much and gained a little weight. my overall critical self was like, oh yup I have man breasts.

Went on to say lower libido, and I hadn’t been particularly interested in sex recently, so yup that checked out.

I went on to read that people with the 47 XXY KARYOTYPE often share development features of women, have low testosterone and must undergo testosterone and hormonal therapy to effectively retain masculinity.

At this point, even though all the other symptoms didn’t check out, I was convinced I had this hormonal disorder and quite possibly a woman trapped in a man’s body. I was freaking out, not thinking logically anymore and went straight to sweating at my desk, rapid heart rate, as I scoured the internet and wiki for more information. A coworker came by to chat, and I snapped at her to go away.

It was about 10 minutes after the initial google search that it dawned on me to double check my google search was correct, and relief ensued.

TL;DR got blood test results back, googled a slightly different KARYOTYPE, and spent the next ten minutes of my life convinced I had a hormonal deficiency and was secretly a woman.

UPDATE: This TIFU is a result of my ADD and impulsive google searching, along with my ignorance of biology and science. I am making fun of myself/laughing at myself and wanted to share my experience with ya'll. I have no intention of misrepresenting folks that are transgender and I certainly don't mean to belittle anyone's identity or life experience. 

I also don't mean to insult anyone with Klinefelter syndrome. This was simply a reaction to having my identity abruptly challenged and jumping to illogical conclusions. Thinking I was anything else other than a typical male would have yielded the same reaction.

Also, there is more to the story as to why we tested my wife first. But pls know that I am not a complete doosh. Not only was the decision mutual, but predicated on medical history and other sensitive information that I just don't want to get into. Despite all the logic behind it, I feel horrible that we didn't start with me.

This TIFU has many layers. 

Thanks for all the love :)

EDIT: fixed two grammatical errors."
"TIFU and almost drowned


Today I fucked up by almost drowning


This happened yesterday, July 23rd. 


This was easily the closest I’ve ever been to death.


My friends and I were on our way back from the local bike park, about an hours drive from where we all live. We decided, since it was a warmer day, that it would be a good idea to go cliff jumping at a nearby lake on the way home. Especially since it’s literally on the drive home, it seemed like the best way to cool off, rinse the dust off, and end the awesome day of biking we had just had. 


When we get to the cliff, the winds are HIGH. I’ve never seen this lake this crazy. Waves were whitecapping, and the waves looked pretty sizeable. This lake is usually as calm as glass.


What all of us didn’t take into account is the height of the cliff. The cliff is probably ~35 feet above the lake. So what we interpreted as 4-5ft waves were closer to 8-10 feet in height.


 Now, we’ve all jumped here before. Many times. This is usually *the* place to cliff jump. It’s easy to get up the side, by climbing up a rock face and there’s a bay just around the corner, maybe a 5 minute swim (if that) in calm weather. Our plan yesterday was to jump, and very quickly swim back to the bay, which we had already noticed, was very calm and easy to swim in. We are all good swimmers, and we thought that the waves being “4-5 feet tall” that this shouldn’t be an issue at all. 


After about 10 minutes of waiting for the waters to calm down a little at the top of the cliff, we all jumped. I was last into the water out of 3 guys. My friends were already hollering at me “YEAH! The water’s great!”. 


I must not have braced myself correctly, because I instantly got easily half a lung full of water when I jumped. Immediately not off to a good start. I coughed it out pretty quickly, but already this had taken some energy out of me. 


After yelling out at my friends how nice the water was, about 10 seconds later I realized that we were in some serious shit. The waves were FAR bigger than we had each anticipated, and I immediately started swimming towards the bay. Maybe another thirty seconds later, I realized that I was hardly moving, and that I was essentially not moving anywhere. 


I looked back at my friends, me being the closest to the bay at this point, by about 10 feet. I will never forget the sheer look of terror on my nearest friend’s face. Immediately I knew we were in some serious shit. 


I turned around and immediately thought to myself: “Okay, stay calm, focus on not taking on water and timing your swimming with the waves”


This was a good idea, I just didn’t execute it well. I took on a few (I honestly can’t remember) more big gulps of water, barely able to clear my lungs before them filling again. 


At this point I yelled straight up so my friends could hear me “ABORT THE BAY, CLIMB THE ROCKS” and I could hear both of them yell back in agreement. 


As you could imagine, the rock face of the cliff was being absolutely thrashed by these waves. My plan was to time my swimming with the waves, latch onto one of the rocks, and get a firm handhold, stay close to the rock, and let one wave hit me, and then keep climbing. I had done something very similar when I was ocean kayaking a few years prior. 


So, while fighting to keep water out of my lungs, I latch onto one of these rocks, straddle it with both of my thighs, press my chest up against it, and hack up some lake water as I feel the water receding down my legs and back out. 


At this point, a giant twelve foot wave hits me, the impact itself wasn’t the problem, but it pulled me back out with it with a force I have never felt before. I was off the rock in a heartbeat and instantly down to the lake floor, roughly ten feet down. 


I put both of my hands above my head, slightly spread out, to try to feel for any objects above me, and push off from the bottom, away from the cliff. 


I’m now back out to the lake, once again trying to time my swimming with these giant waves. This is where I start thinking to myself: “Is this how I die? Am I going to drown today?” 


Now I’m exhausted, gasping for air, barely able to stay afloat. I can’t swim in these waves much longer. I look to my right and see one of my friends, about fifteen feet over,  up on one of the rocks, just as a wave hits the rock, showering him in water as he disappears from my view.


**Focus** Look at the rock, time it, touch the rock, and climb as fast as you can. 


I swim forward with everything I have and latch onto the same spot I had before, only this time I waste no time, I’m 6 feet up this rock in what feels like half a second. I feel the next wave lick my feet and lower calves.


My second friend is now less than two feet to my right, he pats me on the back and asks “You good?” In between my hacking up water I nod and he continues climbing. 


After about 15 seconds I climb up another 10 feet to a flat ledge, already trying to peer over the rock face to see our third friend. He’s up, about 10 feet out of the water, bent over, coughing up water. I Yell “Hey! You good?” He doesn’t lift his head, just raises his left hand and gives me a thumbs up.


We climb another 15 feet or so, and we’re at the top. All of us flop down on the warm rocks, soaking wet, shaking, and bleeding as the sensation of pain comes back into focus. All of us have scraped up shins, I must’ve stepped on a sharp rock, because my foot is red, starting to bruise, and starting to swell. I’ve never been happier to be injured in my life. It’s way better than drowning in that water. Both of the other guys have minor scrapes and bruises as well. 





I fully realize that this was an incredibly stupid decision, and I’m extremely thankful to be alive. Today has been weird. I feel incredibly lucky that I survived and I cannot stop replaying the situation in my head. 





TL;DR Misjudged how high the waves were. Jumped off cliff into raging water, almost didn’t make it out.

"TIFU by seeing what it's like to be blind


Not today but this past weekend I woke up with no particular plans for the day and no need to hurry. Since I had no need to hurry and I'm relatively familiar with my house, I decided to see if I could accomplish waking up, getting showered, brushing my teeth and getting dressed before opening my eyes, because I'm weird.

I stepped out of bed and felt my way to the door, donned my bathrobe from the towel hook and opened the door. So far, so good. I fumbled my way down the hallway, misplacing a few books on the bookshelf and accidentally playing some improvised, atonal and arhythmic music on the piano before taking a left towards the bathroom. I felt my way to the sink, loaded up my toothbrush and scrubbed my pearly whites, rinsed the toothbrush and hung my bathrobe on a hook on the back of the door, still doing alright. I felt for the towel rack and thankfully had a fresh towel hanging up, so I stepped into the shower and set the temperature. Once I was all squeaky clean I dried off and wrapped the towel around myself, forgoing the bathrobe until my sight returned.

Once back out in the hallway I felt for the piano and made my right turn, carefully feeling to make sure I didn't walk into a bookshelf when I felt my cat rubbing herself against my leg. Proud to have made it this far and not wanting to lose this pointless bet I'd made with myself, I proceeded towards my room, shuffling my feet so as to avoid stepping on the cat. Despite my best efforts, she insisted on being stepped on, as it's one of her favorite hobbies, and managed to somehow run headlong into the towel dangling near my feet. Fearing this fluffy predator, she leapt into action subduing the towel. In doing so, she managed to tangle herself up in the towel and was quite content until my full weight came tumbling down towards her and her prey.

It was at this time that I figured I'd lost my game, so I opened my eyes just in time to shift away from crushing the cat and careen headlong into the credenza. As I lay, prone and naked, amidst the narrowly missed shards of wine goblet on the floor, I turned my head to see the cat walk down the hallway to rub herself against the feet of my roommates, who had come downstairs to see what the commotion was. All in all the damage wasn't too bad, the only things shattered were three goblets, two bottles of wine and my dignity. No cats were harmed in the making of this mishap.

TL;DR I decided to see what it would like to be blind, and my cat decided I should see what it's like to be dead."
