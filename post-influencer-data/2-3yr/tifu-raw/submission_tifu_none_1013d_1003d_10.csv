"TIFU by giving a homeless guy $80


Preface: 
*Not trolling for money, thanks* 


So I'm a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I'm broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I'm working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best ""screw up"" ever, I suppose. I'll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.

Happy Holidays guy.

Edit: to whoever gave the gold... I'm so inexperienced with Reddit I had to look up what it even was. haha. Wow. Really didn't expect much response at all I'm honored. Thank you kindly."
"TIFU taking Reddits advice.


This happened last weekend, my parents were out of town and I was reading [this AskReddit thread when I got to this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5i5csd/what_is_your_i_know_it_sounds_weird_but_just_try/db5p4bk/) I realized I had one of these in my house but haven't used it for years. So I went upstairs, [got out the 1990's version of this contraption](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Teeter-EP-560-Inversion-Table-with-Back-Pain-Relief-DVD/23222244?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=3760&amp;adid=22222222227017193045&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=52308893535&amp;wl4=pla-79410631695&amp;wl5=9021618&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=113499840&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=23222244&amp;wl13=&amp;veh=sem), strapped myself in, and started to recline. The thing flipped me over pretty fast and locked in place, completely vertical. At first it felt really good, my lower back cracked in places it hadn't before, but since I was completely upside down, blood started to rush to my head quickly and soon it was time to flip back up. This is when I realized that I didn't know how to come back up, I was seriously locked in place upside down, hanging by my ankles. I struggled for a few minutes trying different ways to escape this contraption, but I couldn't do it. Then I started to panic, I'm thinking to myself how my embarrassing its gonna be when I die this way. Eventually after hanging upside down for a way too long, I decide enough is enough. I sat up, so I could reach my feet and yanked on the little spring loaded knob that was holding my feet in place. It popped open and I fell onto the hardwood floor, with all my weight, on my neck. Now my neck is fucked up, but at least I didn't die taking advice from Reddit.

TLDR: I tried to stretch out my back and ended up destroying my neck."

"TIFU: Guess which one I put in my eye?


https://i.imgur.com/8qWDpRw.jpg

On the bright side, my right eye is now free of all that wax. 

EDITED: Post was removed for lack of context so... There are two bottles. They look similar. One is for ear wax removal while one is a bottle of eye drops. Pre-coffee and groggy, I grabbed the ear wax drops and dropped a couple into one of my eyes. It hurt and I felt like an idiot.

EDIT #2: Post was removed for violation of sub rule 2E) Nothing significantly bad happened to you as a result. So to continue from where we left off: Ear-wax drops contain hydrogen peroxide, which Consumer Med Safety refers to as ""a painful mistake"" to put in your eye. Their story checks: It was painful. I was able to flush my eye out with water pretty quickly, though there was a lingering burning and redness for quite some time. It didn't warrant a trip to the ER, thankfully, unlike many of the commenters who have stories of mixing up eye drops and super glue (I can't even). Though it wasn't as painful as the time I had bear mace directly contact my eye (that's a whoooole 'nother TIFU), I strongly recommend double-checking any and all bottles of eye drops before using them.

"TIFU by getting fired as a volunteer Santa


I offered to volunteer as Santa once a week over Christmas. All I had to do was listen to the kids and hand them a present. One mother fucker ran at me and tried to jump in my lap. His feet landed directly on my balls.

I immediately bolted up grabbing my dick, the kid fell backwords over the chair and chipped his tooth. I slipped and fell on one of the fake reindeer and crushed it.

The kid is bawling. Some others in line start crying. I'm told to go home. As I walk out two women hit me with purses. And a father pushed me and told me he will ""Fuck everbody I love"".

The worst part is I had a drink with my friend before and forgot gum for my breath.  So I was ultimately fired because they thought I was drunk.

**Note**

There is a video. 
I'll be in touch soon about the clip! Thanks for the offers! Part of the issue is the video is over 20 minutes long, my friend was there taping his relatives. So a lot needs to be erased. And I'm finishing my teaching work term (yes I will soon be a teacher). So I can't have some of the faces of the kids I teach etc. in it. Or I feel like I shouldn't. 

Also, in regard to the drink. It was one beer and a burger I bought with a gift card. Relax! Ha

And should I post the video here? Or make a new post once I have it?

Love Santa"
"TIFU by almost getting disowned by my wifes' family for xmas


This happened xmas eve/ xmas day.   My favorite holiday is Halloween and I love dressing up and being festive for holidays.   This year, I decided to buy one of those ""riding a snowman"" costumes to wear at our family gatherings.   I also bought an ugly xmas sweater that had a picture of a cartoon tree saying ""I don't want your balls on me"" with (2) red tree decorations (round balls basically).   I threw on an elf hat with fake ears and I was ready to be the funny idiot at Christmas.

I went to my family gathering xmas eve (tons of people and little kids aged 2 and up)  Walked in and everyone had a laugh, the kids thought it was funny and I proceeded to have a merry Christmas....

Next day I decided to wear it to my wife's family gathering...they are a little more serious and straight laced than my family, but I've known them for 19yrs now and they know I'm a moron who does stuff like this. (I wore the bunny suit from a ""A Christmas Story"" there last year)....well, immediately upon entering my sister-in-laws house, my nieces descended upon me and basically attacked me (not the reaction I was expecting)....it was at that moment I realized that the carrot nose on the snowman wasn't in the most appropriate place....they start tugging on the carrot and punching the snowman in the face (or my crotch depending on the way you look at it)...her grandfather shoots me a look of death and I decide it's time to lose the pants.   No big deal as I had pants on underneath.

I couldn't however lose my sweater because I only had a raggy white t-shirt underneath.   The kids there ranged from 1-about 5 1/2...

As we're half way through dinner and everyone is eating at the table, my sweet as can be 5yr old niece who was sitting across from me blurts out (real loud and clear too...) ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!""  ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!"" ""I DON'T WANT YOUR BALLS ON ME!""......

I didn't realize any of them could read yet.   HONESTLY.

I try to cover up and explain to her that the hooks on the ornaments are sharp and heavy and the trees don't like them

Her grandparents are now murdering me with their eyes and her aunt starts yelling how inappropriate I am and how dare I wear something so horrible when I knew there would be little girls around.

My wife said I went from being the ""fun uncle"" to the ""creepy pervert uncle"" really fast....

I apologized but felt pretty bad about it.   Don't know if I can show my face there next year now.

TL;DR - wore inappropriate apparel to holiday gathering and now I'm labeled a pervert by my in-laws.

"TIFU by borrowing my wife's deodorant


**EDIT:** Obligatory RIP my inbox. Thanks to everyone who replied. I got some good laughs with my wife reading some of the responses. And some of you helped me feel less awful with your own anecdotes.

**For those who are curious, 7 hours later later and it still burns like hell. I'll switch to real baby powder on my armpits for the next few days, maybe some kind of salve or cream in the meantime.**

*********************************

This literally happened 10 minutes ago.

So, today is the big Christmas dinner with my family, which we're doing on Christmas Eve for some reason.

I haven't seen a lot of my family members in the last year which, in terms of weight loss, was more than 50 lbs ago. I still have a long way to go, but I look much more presentable and dress much better, etc.

So I'm getting all primped up: haircut, shave the neck, trim the beard, go all out for looking my level best. Take a nice long shower, **and then the fuck up:**

I decide that recently, my deodorant hasn't been doing a great job of blocking out smells for more than maybe 3-4 hours, and this could be an all evening into nearly midnight event. So I got to grab my wife's deodorant and take the cap off.

Now, this isn't like any deodorant I've seen before. It [has a slotted top](http://i.imgur.com/PVs2YYK.jpg) where the gel comes out. She usually uses a baby-powder-based deodorant, which I find quite dry, so I figured this is a more gel-like version.

I rub it on my armpits and immediately get this funky smell....followed by an intense burning sensation. I flip it over and see, to my horror, [what it actually is](http://i.imgur.com/9Z1hfbX.jpg).

Nair. It's fucking Nair.

I run to the bathroom and trying wiping with a towel, which removes a few hairs and knots up some others. Unfortunately, I've done this to both armpits so I hop in the shower apply soap and vigorously rinse with warm water.

Brief relief. Then I make the second fuckup, which is putting my Old Spice on my armpits. **BURNS LIKE HELL, Part II**.

I hope in the shower and repeat the same procedure as before.

This time, I manage to use my wife's *actual* Dove deodorant, which has no added chemicals - just baby powder.

[My armpits may not look too bad in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/fD9BEJw.jpg), but it's been 10 minutes and they still hurt like hell.

**TL;DR - borrow my wife's deodorant, turns out it was Nair, chemical burns and fucked up armpit pair ensues.**"

"TIFU by opening a water bottle at an airport


So this just happened like an hour ago. I've a long lay over in an airport in eastern Europe, so I decided to buy a water bottle in the duty free. What I didn't know is that they packed it like alcohol, so you aren't supposed to open the package until you reach your final destination.

This doesn't stopped me, so as the madlad that I am, I go to the bathroom and drink some of the water there and then I put it back in my bag. But leave the package that says do not open until reaching final destination also in my bag.

5mins later as I'm walking through the airport a guard comes to me and starts speaking Russian, I don't understand anything and he says oh you look Russian (I'm Latin, whatever) he then asks for my passport and I start to get nervous since I've the open bottle in my bag, the guy notices and asks to search my bag.
He founds the bottle and starts questioning me, then he asks me to accompany him to a waiting room while they checked the bag.

Long story short, I lost my flight because of waiting there and they also kept my water bottle. Now I'm stuck here for 6 more hours and had to pay 200e for a new ticket, all because of a stupid water bottle.

TL;DR TIFU by opening a water bottle in an airport and getting caught. Which cause me to loose my flight and my water bottle."
"TIFU by not being able to tell between my left and my right.


I went to take my road test for my license a few hours ago. They have a course at the testing location so I didn't need to go out on the open road and drive. Everything was going pretty smoothly until the examiner said to ""stay on your right"". For some reason, most likely out of nervousness, I switched over to the lane on my left and I automatically failed. I was kinda shocked at first and now I'm just upset at myself for not being able to distinguish between my right and my left. It's also kind of embarrassing because almost everyone I know passed their drivers test on their first try. It feels like I'm the only one who needs additional attempts.

Edit: Thanks a lot guys for all the positive comments and encouragement! I'll have to wait two more weeks before I'm allowed another attempt. "
"TIFU: By not recognising piss.


So this happened on Saturday the 24th of December. Yes. Christmas Eve I fucked up pretty bad. 

So I work at a local EB games store and I can't help but inform you that I have some days where everything goes so damn well. Whereas others are just not so much. 

As some of you may be aware we trade in video games, which is a cool part of the job. You get to help people like yourself save heaps on new things. 

A pretty rough looking lady comes in and I get this smell in my nose and I just can't hit what it is but she comes to my till and asks if she could trade some games in. Of course I say yes and ask the mandatory questions. ""Do you have your EB world card and some photo ID for the trade?"" 

Now that there. That is where things got a little different. She asked ""can I use this as my photo ID?"" And pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from her bag. I unfold it and read it and it turns out to be a prison release form with everything I needed from a photo ID card to process the trade. So I double check with my manager to which he looks at me like ""... What the hell?"" But does agree and say I can. 

Onwards. I proceed to do this trade to which I find has a very obscure smell to it. I find myself trying not to gag multiple times as some of the games were quite damp. But I list them into a defective section so they can get sent to our warehouse and fixed if they're damaged. By now I'm assuming it's just water damage and maybe mould? Which... I guess it isn't too out of the ordinary coming from the neighbourhood I grew up in. A lot of people didn't treat their games as well as they should. But none ever this bad. 

So time goes by and we're fairly busy. So I put these games behind the counter on a shelf so we can sticker them up. This smell lingered on for quite a while.. 

Eventually it quietens down and we do everything we needed to. Except these games. To which the girl I'm working with gets to before I do. 

She pauses. Looks at me. Looks at the games. Leans in and sniffs. Looks back at me and says. "".. These smell like piss.."" 

My stomach drops at this point. She went through and found them all. I think back to when I had it all wet on my hands. I rush out the back and practically shower in this hand sanitiser we have and pretty much scream in silence.

We straight out threw those games in the bin with a note on them saying ""CHEMICALLY UNSTABLE"" just because we didn't want anyone going near them.

My managers don't scold me though as I was expecting. My assistant manager walks over to me with a slight scary smirk on his face and says to me ""I know in your time you've probably had some mad customers... but have you ever had anyone as pissy as her?"" And just laughed. 

TLDR: I accepted a game trade from an ex-prisoner who had pissed on her video games before trading them in. :( "
"TIFU by slitting my wrists for a cookie


Like all TIFU's, this happened a couple of years ago when I was in high school. In was in French class and there was a substitute, so every body was on their phones. My friend,(we'll call him Billy) had a mom who baked the tastiest sugar cookies, and he had pulled them out. I said to him, ""yo, can I get a cookie?"" Billy said ""Ha no their mine."". Now, when I said those cookies were tasty, I meant it. Mouth watering cookies, so I said, ""I'll do anything bro."". So him, being the sadist he is, told me he would give me the entire bag if i slashed my wrists with scissors. I said hell no, but he double dog dared me, and I'm not a pussy, so I said fine. I walked up behind the sub and grabbed the sharpest scissors there. I walked back to my seat and this is where the fuck up happened. Instead of doing it myself, I let Billy do it. He pushed down on my wrists and dragged it across. I shouted ""FUCK""  and the sub came running to see what happened, only to see bloodied scissors and me on the floor. The sub panicked and ran to the office and a couple minutes later the ambulance came. They took me to the hospital, and told me I was 2 inches away from slashing my arteries. I then had to explain to my parents what happened.


tl;dr i cut my wrists for some cookies and almost died

EDIT: millimetres* not inches. boy am I retarded"

"TIFU by telling my brother-in-law I shaved my beard


I live in a very small house. I came home and my half naked wife barged me out of the way and ran up stairs. She is going out with the girls and rushing to get ready and apparently the window in the front room gives the best light to do your face. There is make-up and hair shit all over the sofa and table, not enough room for me to smoke and play xbox so I start tidying up.

Cue brother-in-law. He pops round to drop off a thing but I say his sister should be down in 10 so he should sit down and chat while I tidy. 

Earlier in the day I washed the bed sheets and one was supposed to be hanging off the door, but instead it sits in a pile on the ground. 

I pick it up, shake it out ready to put back on the door, only to find a puff of something has filled the air and is settling gently over my brother-in-law. He spits the something out of his mouth and asked, terrified I might add, 'what the fuck was that?'.

Now, I love my wife and please don't judge her. I am sure this is a common thing people do. 

I noticed that nestled between the hair straighteners and dryer were my clippers (don't get me started). Knowing my wife there was only one logical conclusion - the bits were trimmed and the trim is now being plucked from Brother-in-laws teeth (ok - maybe they wern't that embeded).

Anyway - I being the wonderful husband I am told him that I had shaved my beard last night and I needed the good light from the downstairs window but I forgot I did it on the sheet not to make a mess. Quick thinking.

He knew.

He knew I knew he knew.

I know this because I am a good husband but not a smart man and I stood there infront of him with a very full beard on my face

We sat in silence until she came down.

I think it is fucking hilarious but I have been sworn to secrecy so I share with you all instead.

so **TLDR: I unknowingly shook out a sheet that my wife had sat on while she shaved her bits (so they didn't go on the floor which would have been easy to hoover surely) and in the process covered my brother-in-law in my wife's pubic hair.** "
