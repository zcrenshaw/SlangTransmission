"TIFU by holding my breath and passing out during a lecture.


This happened earlier today. So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I'll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I'll rest for 3 minutes. I'll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I'm feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. ""I can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". So I go and I'm feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I'm feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I'm struggling. Like I'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but I'm going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I'm seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. Lecture still sucked after that. 

TL;DR Tried going for Olympic gold in breath holding. Failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall. 

EDIT: A word

"TIFU by joking with a date I was a serial killer.


So because of circumstances beyond my control this didn't happen today.

Cue my first date with a girl I met on Tinder, we meet up at a restaurant and get to talking. This are going great, she thinks I'm funnier in person (when does that ever happen?!), she actually invites me to the mall to hangout more with some of her friends when dinner is over.

So after the food arrives the conversation turns a little more towards how we met (pay close attention and you will spot my mistake). She states she's glad I'm normal and not some sort of serial killer.

Now I could have just laughed... I could have but I was funny remember? I replied with ""Oh thanks for thinking I'm normal! But I actually am a serial killer, bodies for days buried out at the farm.""

She laughed, I laughed, I thought I did great at making it sound sarcastic.

She excuses herself to the bathroom to do whatever girls do in bathrooms on dates. It was taking a questionably long time for her to return and I was slightly worried she bailed and stuck me with the bill, my luck right? Wrong.

So unbelievably wrong, my luck was worse as police officers suddenly appear out of nowhere and tell me to keep both of my hands visible on the table.

At this point I'm confused, this must be a joke. I see my date coming with a staff member and get ready for Ashton Kutcher to appear, no such luck.

The police ask if it's me and she says ya, the cops get me to stand up and handcuff me and walk me out, not a single person seems to want to answer any of my questions.

I'm in the car and the police are outside talking to my date for a few minutes when they get into the car with me and ask me if I told my date I was a serial killer, areyoufuckingkiddingme...

I tell them yes but I was joking.

LPT: Don't admit to police you told someone you were a serial killer.

So that derailed my plans, I spent the next 5-6 hours explaining myself over and over and over that I was kidding.

I guess eventually they either believed me or got tired of hearing me speak much to my lawyers disapproval (to me speaking) and let me go and reminded me that my jokes suck.

I'm not sure how date number two will go but I'm excited to find out, also a bright side is that I have no idea who paid for my food.

TL:DR: I made a joke I was a serial killer, date doesn't get sarcasm, I spend hours in the police station."
"TIFU by not finding a better place to hide my weed.


Well thankfully this didn't happen today or yesterday.  This fuck up actually happened when I was a kid...about 16?(which is why I can laugh about it now!)  

So anyways... back in the day I used to enjoy a little bud as a high schooler.  Most of my friends did as well, but we lived in Utah at the time which means pretty much none of our parents were cool with smoking...quite the opposite in fact. 

So with our strict parents in mind as little stoner high school kids we have to think of some pretty creative ways to hide our weed. I even unscrewed my DVD player, hid weed in it and my mom still almost found it. 

This time I was going to make sure was different!   I was going to find the best place I could to hide it.  I thought to myself shortly after buying some weed for my friends birthday...""I bet hiding this outside would be perfect!""  ""She won't smell it and she never comes out here, so she won't just find it!"" So as I'm outside smoking with my friend, I feel like I hit the goldmine of weed hiding ideas! We wrap up smoking and my mom's coming home soon, so I scout the yard and decide to hide my weed in the very back of the yard, wedged in between a fence and my shed. Over top of the weed i placed a big wooden 2x4.  I go to bed happy as can be because I think I've finally won.  
So I wake up the next morning and went to school. Just another normal day.  I get home to both my parents being at my moms.  This already sets off a red flag in my mind because having divorced parents, the only time they hang out together is when someone's in trouble.
So I walk in the door to find them sitting at the table waiting for me.  At this point I'm expecting them to have find a pipe or some papers. Ha! I sit down at the table and my dad pulls out this bag of weed.  I was just like what the fuck how did you find this?!?! Do you have hidden cameras or some shit!?!?  My mom slowly starts smiling and points to my Australian Shepherd.  Apparently my dog saw me hide it, got a little curious and decided to prance around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth right as my mom was outside having a cigarette. 

Yes I definitely got grounded.

Also, yes the dog is still alive and I'm writing this right next to the bitch!

Edit: Punctuation, Picture of the culprit http://imgur.com/WDZP2dX

Wow front page! 

Edit: For those who don't understand why my mom would be mad when she smokes cigarettes... it's because I was in high school.   

TL;DR Thought I had found the goldmine of weed hiding.  Dog had other plans and started prancing around the yard with my bag of weed in her mouth getting me caught."
"TIFU on the walk of shame



This happened last week. No throwaway because everyone already knows what happened. 

I ended up at a guys house for a casual hookup. He fell asleep and it was only like 11pm and I couldn’t sleep to save my life. So, being considerate, I decided to bail so that I could go play on my phone(reddit) and not wake him up. 

I exit the house and find the gate we’d come through, only, it’s closed. To make matters worse, it's one of those weird gates that doesn't have a handle, but a keyhole on both sides. 

I decide, hey, I’m an adult, I can climb this fence, no problem. It’s got spikes on top, but I’m pretty positive that I can handle it. 

So, in my heels I decide to climb the fence. I get to the top and look down and realize this is easiest the highest gate/fence I’ve ever climbed. However, being precariously perched over the spikes, I realize it’s too late to turn back now. 

So I jump down, and perfectly stick the landing. YES.

Then I take a step forward and feel the arch in my left foot scream in protest. 

It’s cool, I can totally walk this off.

Make my way home and by the next morning, I can no longer put weight on it. Fuck. 

So I head to urgent care where lo and behold they ask for my ID and I realize I’ve left my fucking wallet at the guys house. 

I get put into a boot and told I have a sprain and possible fracture. Not only this, but I had PAX EAST (a gaming convention) the following weekend and ended up having to cancel because I couldn't walk as much as I was going to need to for all my meetings. Double fuck. 

So now I’m in a boot, missing my favorite con, and still ended up having to go back to the guys house to get my wallet.

TLDR: Hopped a fence in heels after a one night stand, broke foot. Left wallet there, still had to go back. Double fuck up. "
"TIFU by getting fired because of the movie Supertroopers


Not today but back when I was waiting tables at a steakhouse years ago we used to do all kinds of dumb stuff to keep ourselves entertained. One thing we did was play the infamous ""cat game"" from the movie Supertroopers. Basically we would follow someone out to their table and when we placed the customer's food down we would say something like ""here's your strip steak meow"". Then, on a busy Saturday night, I followed a co-worker out and dropped of his customer's food followed by a ""here's your chop steak meow"". Apparently, the guy thought I called him ma'am, made a big scene, called over our freshly hired new GM who ended up comping a $80 check because of his bitching. I finished my shift and was fired before I left because he said he needed to make an example of me. In retrospect, I should have called the guy a chicken fucker.

Edit: yes I know I played the game wrong, hence the reason it backfired :)

TL;DR I got fired for playing cat game from Supertroopers"
"TIFU by being courteous


I live in a very snowy place. Yesterday alone, we received about 4 feet of snow. This fu happened in the morning, last week. I drive to work, and as I was driving down my street I came face to face with a snow removal truck. Because my street is very narrow, there was now way I could just pass by, so I decided to be courteous and backed up in the nearest driveway, so they truck could pass. However, the driver did not raise the snow-plow and built a dense 3 feet snow wall in the entrance of the driveway I just pulled in. My car is way too small/low and I got stuck trying to get out.  I had to walk home, get a shovel and dig for 1/2 hr just to get out. 


As a result, I was late for work and I am the running gag of the office. 

Tldr: left home for work on a snowy day, pulled in a driveway so a snow removal truck could pass, the driver pushed so much snow in that driveway I got stuck and had to get back home and bring a shovel and work 30min to get out..."
"TIFU by getting Rubik's cubes banned from school (taken from my story on /r/cubers)


I was homeschooled for 11 out of 12 years of school before college. While my education was good, I was left with a lot of free time. That free time is why is decided to learn the Rubik's cube in the first place. That one year that I wasn’t homeschool was my junior year and I went to a private Christian school. 


After the first quarter of the school year, I brought a rubik's cube to school for the first time. I only played with it during lunch and study hall because I didn’t want to distract other students or teachers. It didn’t take long and I had several people asking me to teach them. After a few days I taught a friend the beginners method and gave them a cheat sheet for basic OLL and PLL. Since I had several people asking me to teach them, I told about ten people that I would teach them if they brought their own cubes. Within the next week, five or six people had gone out and bought cubes from amazon and showed them to me. I taught three or four people over the course of the next month and one kid even bought a giant cube that was about 10x bigger than normal. (fun fact: he didn’t know how to solve it then and I asked him recently and he still has the cube and still doesn’t know how to solve it)


It wasn’t a very big school. We had maybe 150 students total. Needless to say, a trend like this reaches everyone’s ears quickly. Friends that I had taught were teaching other people who went out to buy cubes and the next thing I knew, lunch time was full of the sounds of crappy cubes twisting and turning as about 15 people had their own cubes. At this time, I was sub-45 and most other students where sub-2 or sub-3 at best. 


I thought it was a fun, little brain exercise that anyone could enjoy and wouldn’t cause any trouble with the school administration. I was wrong.


At this school, we had chapel every friday before lunch. Before the religious message, we’d have announcements that usually have things like birthdays or holidays, and occasionally if a large group of people were breaking rules like using their phones during class then it would be announced that this particular thing is a problem, this is a warning, and we’re about to start cracking down on this and giving out lots of detentions. 


The principal of the school got up to give announcements like always and said that recently there’s been an epidemic at the school that needs to be addressed. Apparently while I was following the rules and not pulling it out during class, some students weren’t so smart. It was officially banned from being pulled out in a classroom. Any violations would result in a detention. (the principal was very new and unprofessional and never gave out warnings or demerits. In the school of 150, there was about 20 detentions given out per week) 


I was proud that a trend that I had started had gotten so big that it had to be addressed to the whole school, and I wasn’t worried about getting in trouble because I never used it in class. (also; side note, you could only use a rubik's cube on campus if 1: Cafeteria, 2: Study Hall, or 3: the teacher says you can.) 


Apparently lots of students completely ignored the rule. Either that, or the principal just got jealous that he didn’t know how. Because it was announced that rubik’s cubes are officially banned from the school campus. If a cube was seen anywhere. In or out of a backpack. Cafeteria or classroom, the cube would be permanently confiscated and the culprit gets a detention. 


They made a section about it in the yearbook.

Rubik's cubes banned from school

https://imgur.com/gallery/YiAdV


The year after, I didn’t attend, but my brother did. The school got a new principal and cubes are allowed again. 


A few different things happened regarding this story, but this story is long enough. I’ve had this story on my mind for a while and decided it was time to post this here on /r/cubers (and now here to /r/TIFU).

TL : DR


-Brought Rubik's Cube to school, not in class

-Taught friend

-People thought it was cool

-Taught them

-Lots of people who later used them in class

-Warning was given that detentions will be given for using them in class

-People didn't listen

-Cubes were banned from the campus entirely"

"TIFU by shooting my friend point blank with a pellet gun


Happened way back when I was around 12 or 13. My friends and I were hanging out at our richest friend's house talking about mundane shit when I saw a pellet gun. I picked it up cocked it, removed the clip then proceeded to wave the gun around at my friends like Jonah Hill in ""This is the End"". One of my friends screams: ""That's loaded! Put it down!"" I scoffed and said, ""You idiot! I took out the clip."" Then pointed the gun at my rich friend and pulled the trigger from about 3 feet.
.
.
.
Yep he got a pretty bad pellet welt that was bleeding and bruised. Looked painful too as he was writhing on the floor. One of my friends then told me that I was an idiot and then explained how the whole gun loading process works.
.
.
.
My victim then proceeded to tell his mom about it who had just arrived home after shopping who then unhappily told me: ""So you were the one who shot my son!!"" Then sent me home.

We're all still friends to this day. But have never talked about that fateful day. Good thing they forgot. :)

Edit: replaced a letter and removed an apostrophe
Edit: To all those bitching that this didn't happen ""TODAY"" do everyone else a favor and read point 2 in the rules. There's your TIL entry.

TL;DR Thought I knew how pellets guns worked but ended up shooting my friend at point blank range."
"TIFU by being too blue


My tale of woe actually happened a few hours ago. 

This year I decided to be more true to myself. More creative. More adventurous. I gently dipped my toe in the alternative waters and got my hair dyed bright purple at a salon. So edgy, I know. It looked so wonderful for about a week.

Unfortunately, my hair gets so oily I could open a fish &amp; chip shop and run the fryers off my follicles. So the colour washed out very quickly. It faded to that silvery lavender hue that appears *tres chic* on Kelly Osbourne and Lady Gaga. Somehow it made me appear minutes past the point of *livor mortis*. 

Unable to afford bi-monthly professional hair maintenance I went the DIY route instead. I bought a little stirring cup, hair paint brush thing, gloves, and most importantly the glorious black cape to make it very profesh. I found the drug-store hair dye was ok, but I wanted a BOLDER colour. I wanted to make a STATEMENT. I asked my neon-haired friends which brands they like. “Manic Panic”, they all said. Manic Panic indeed.

As the latest cheap hair colour faded I got some Manic Panic Rockabilly Blue. The whole tub went on. None of that wussy pastel-dilution for me thanks. 30 minutes later I entered the bathroom to rinse off the colour. The water ran a deep blue as the colour washed away. I rubbed shampoo through my hair, rinsed, and was greeted with smurf blue hands. Shit.

I look down and my feet were smurf blue. My calves. Upper thighs. Shit shit shit. At this point, the home-hair experts amongst you might be wondering, “How the hell did you get colour over yourself like that while rinsing your hair over the tub?”. Was I in the tub? WAS I? No.

Genius me did what I always do when rinsing my hair and I jumped into the shower. I let that hot water cascade from head to toe, carrying blue dye down my whole nekkid body. Did I just dip my head under a running tap like a smart person? Of course not. Instead, I’ve given myself the hue complement of a Golden Shower. 

As I surveyed the damage I realised I’ve flicked hair dye over the white shower curtain and shower mat. It’s soaked into the porous 70s terrazzo floor of the shower. Dangerously close our treasured decorative terrazzo fish. 

Did my troubles end here? No of course not. This is TIFU. And I committed.

Literally in a Manic Panic now, I maniacally tried scrubbing the dye off with a harsh exfoliator. It felt like I was stripping my fleshy bits with tradesman grade sand paper. 

It hurt. It was not super effective. I summoned Mum.

Mum entered the bathroom to find her brightest golden-child looking quite the opposite. Worse, I had my back turned to the water to rinse my hair so the colour got in all the parts I couldn’t reach like my back. And down my bum crack. 

Mum stepped up as contender for Mother Of the Year. She scrubbed the back and ass-crack of her 30-something daughter, who’s bent over ass up, and dyed blue.

Except the exfoliant wasn’t working. Mum is a domestic goddess and remembered orange oil is great for stain removal. So she started wiping orange oil over my blue bits. And holy jesus Christ on a stick, It worked! You guys, I'm declaring orange oil the new Windex. 

So now, I’m just mildly tinted blue, except my fingernails which are still blue. I smell like a citrus garden. But I have my nice blue hair. I also had to bleach and scrub the shower. And i’m pleased to report Mr terrazzo fish emerged unscathed. 

For proof, because pics or it didn't happen, here's my [blue](http://imgur.com/K78Kew7) [legs](http://imgur.com/y4oiCFC), [blue nails](http://imgur.com/0qZvbiB), [blue hair](http://imgur.com/2f1DCXB), and [Mr terrazzo fish] (http://imgur.com/BnQPeku).
I’m blue da ba dee da ba die ...

EDIT TL;DR: Feeling blue. Dyed hair blue. Accidentally blue myself instead.

"TIFU by spinning a fidget toy up to high RPM's


This happened roughly 30 minutes ago.
These finger spinner toys have been getting pretty popular at my school in the past week. Kids have been making their own, So i decided to make my own. three ball bearings, some zip ties, and hot glue. Worked good. I thought it would be a good idea to use an air compressor to see how fast i could make it spin. Held it up around eye level and started blasting it, In my head i was thinking it was pretty damn cool. Before i knew it the thing exploded. One bearing hit me in the thumb right below my nail, Possibly breaking it. The other bearing whizzed past my head and broke a window behind me. So glad i didn't lose an eye...
I recovered 2 of 3 bearings.

TL;DR: High speed ball bearings broke window and possibly my thumb.

Edit: to the people who are wondering how the hell I made this thing,  http://imgur.com/OcsAVTO
Basically that, but covered in hot glue.

Edit 2: My thumb is ok! As for the window......
Also my highest upvoted post, thanks for acknowledging my fuckup.

Edit 3: I'll put a picture of the window when I'm able to :) Edit: Here's the broken window!

"TIFU by forgetting babies exist and making a circus crew dig through the trash for hours.


Not today, but a few months ago. 
I recently became part of a circus production that is well-known in my area. I joined a few months ago and got a really great part and I was super excited to meet people and hopefully make some friends. The only problem is that I can be pretty shy and awkward at times so meeting new people is difficult for me.

Anyway this FU happened in October. I hadn’t made many friends by the time our Halloween show rolled around. New recruits like myself are required to work shows doing things like ushering, concessions, tickets, etc. since we haven't had time to learn acts yet. I decide to do ushering since I can at least see the show and chill out. It's a Saturday night and the show has just ended. As I help usher people out I figure I would join in with the custodial crew because hey why not? I can maybe make some small talk and show that I am a team player. That's probably where the fuck up began.

I'm walking through the bleachers picking up trash when I come across a really small pair of pants. Like, really really small. I don't know why I thought it was funny but it just was. Who leaves tiny pants behind at a circus? Way too small for an adult and children aren’t this small, right?
I should have just put them back where I found them but I didn't. I should have given it to a crew member but I didn’t. 
Here is the real fuck up. I thought to myself, ""I bet if I just get rid of these tiny pants and pretend they were never here, everyone can go home early and I will be a hero!"" or something like that. (important to note that there is a huge checklist of things the cast and crew must do every night before going home. Cleaning the bleachers is one of them)

I can't explain why I did it but...I threw them away. I know it probably makes me an asshole for doing that but I just wanted those very small pants gone and out of my life. Well that obviously was a huge mistake.
The cast and crew are all gathered together about 20 minutes later in front of the circus directors who are all saying things like “Great show tonight! Everything is checked off the list tonight already! Fantastic!” I’ve totally forgotten about the pants at this point, already imagining myself snuggled at home (my feet were killing me from ushering shows all day long). Then the director says, “Just one more thing and I can set you all loose. A woman who attended our last show said she dropped her diaper bag and apparently a pair of baby pants fell out. Did anyone see a small pair of pants while cleaning the bleachers?”
My heart went to my throat. I couldn’t believe I threw away those damn pants. I couldn’t believe someone came back for them. I COULDN’T BELIEVE I FORGOT BABIES EXISTED. 
Everyone is looking around confused, waiting for someone to speak up. 
“Come on, guys, someone had to have seen them. Maybe someone put them in the lost and found?”

SHIT. SHIT. SHIT. Why did I forget we had a lost and found?? 

But wait, we could just go to the trash can and get them. Surely they would be near the top? Since I was in the back of the crowd I sort of muffled my voice but shouted “I think they got thrown away!” Everyone starts looking around for who said it but I look around confused too. 

The director is angry and tells us that no one is leaving until we find those pants. All the garbage cans have been emptied and put into the giant dumpster we have in the back.
So we all start slowly making our way to the dumpster meanwhile everyone is saying things like “FUCK the guy that threw away those pants.” “Yeah, who doesn’t just put them in lost and found?” “Whoever did it better hope I don’t find them, they are so dead.”

I try to join in with the bashing of this mysterious pants-thrower-away-er but I mostly just tried to keep my breathing steady and not look suspicious. 

We get to the dumpster and find that there are over 30 trash bags that have been thrown away over the course of the day and there was no way to know where it was. Cue the entire circus staff and crew climbing into this dumpster, throwing the garbage over the side and hand picking through the smelly and disgusting trash. It was mostly popcorn, peanuts and empty cups until one of the cast members chucked one of the bags over that hadn’t been tied properly and a blue-ish liquid completely soaked the 15 people standing underneath them, ruining their clothes and shoes. At this point it is 2 am, freezing cold, everyone is exhausted and just wants to be home. NOT sifting through trash for a tiny pair of pants.
Finally, someone shouted “I found them!” and we all cheered. The pants were returned to a grateful mother and everyone was allowed to go home.
While walking to the parking lot I halfheartedly said “At least this was sort of like a bonding experience huh?”
The only response was “Fuck off.”


TL;DR I was cleaning up after a circus show and found a small pair of pants. Assumed no normal sized human or child could fit into them so I threw them away. Turns out babies are a thing and the mom wanted the pants back. Entire circus cast and crew stayed until 2 a.m. searching through nasty garbage until we found them.

Edit: Just some quick points of clarity. A lot of people are asking why the mom would even want the tiny trash pants back. My wall of text was already really long so I didn't mention that 1) The director obviously didn't tell the woman that they had been thrown away, just that we would look for them and call her if we found them and 2) the director himself took them home to wash them so she wouldn't even know. They were not expensive but bossman was more concerned with our professional appearance so yeah.

Edit 2: To make this all worse, we are a university-run circus production which means that we donate all of our time and energy to these shows, we don't even get class credit haha yay. (Don't get me wrong, I love it to death and is by far my favorite extra curricular)"
"TIFU by calling the cops and getting my grandma detained


So currently I am staying with my grandma while I go to my local community college, she lives in a neighborhood with 24/7 security officers that patrol at night. Tonight I had class late and had planned to spend the night at a friends house since I don't have any Wednesday classes. However, my friend got called into work last minute so I decided to head home. Here is where the fuck up began, I completely forgot to let my grandma know that I'd be coming home and she didn't expect to see me until Wednesday night. So I drove home and her car was gone, and the lights all off. I was a little confused but thought maybe she ran to the store or something. As it turns out she had taken her car into the shop earlier today and had turned in for an early night. I let myself in and headed towards my room using only my phone for light, but when I turned the hall I saw a dark figure and panicked, turning and running to the front door. I quickly got in my car and drove a few blocks down, calling the cops and frantically explaining the situation. Since this neighborhood is pretty far from the station, they contacted the private security to respond first and said they'd be there for backup as soon as possible. Fast forward about 20 minutes and I'm standing with a security guard out front of my grandma's house while three others patrol the area. Another 15 minutes and the cops show up just in time to see the other security guards come out from a neighbors side yard with my handcuffed and very confused grandma.

Now from my grandma's perspective. She knew I wasn't coming home tonight and had settled in for an early night. She woke up not to long after and went to get a glass of water, god knows why she didn't turn on the light. Anyways, she opens up her door to see a tall intruder stumbling in and shining a flashlight at the floor. Still groggy from just waking up, she gets the hell out of there without a second thought. She runs out her backdoor into the yard and lets herself out the back gate, onto the hiking trail that runs behind all the houses. She then runs down two houses to a neighbor that she knows well and lets herself in their back gate, running to their house and frantically banging on their back door. Of course the stars had to align just right for this to happen, and they did. The neighbors weren't home. I guess then my grandma heard some voice and got incredibly scared that the intruder was coming after her, so she hid in this neighbor's dog house (good thinking grandma).  Of course the security followed the trail of open gates and made it to the backyard, my grandma saw the security and ran out thinking she was saved. Unfortunately these guys aren't exactly the best and brightest so they detained my grandma and didn't listen a word she was saying. 

After a lot of explaining from both of us, the cops laughed profusely, the security guys apologized profusely and everyone was on their way. Luckily, grammy is doing well, she wasn't hurt at all and thinks the whole mess is quite funny, but I still feel awful. This literally just happened and I'm still wound up so I hope I didn't leave out any essential details.  I guess at least the family will have something fun to laugh about at Easter brunch.


TL;DR Grandma and I both thought the other was an intruder, I called the police and she got detained."
