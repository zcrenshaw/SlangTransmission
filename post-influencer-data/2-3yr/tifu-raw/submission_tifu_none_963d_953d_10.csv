"TIFU by going to the Eiffel Tower &amp; getting my girlfriend and I tear-gassed, trampled, assaulted, and robbed


^Obligatory: ^This ^didn't ^happen ^today, ^but ^over ^the ^summer. ^also ^warning ^some ^NSFW ^language.

^TL;DR ^first ^because ^it's ^long: ^Went ^to ^Eiffel ^Tower ^to ^watch ^Euro ^2016 ^finals, ^ended ^up ^in ^a ^[riot](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/euro-2016-french-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-supporters-outside-paris-fan-zone-during-france-match-a7129906.html) ^because ^we ^ran ^late, ^got ^tear ^gassed, ^girlfriend ^dislocated ^knee, ^her ^phone ^stolen, ^my ^nose ^broken, ^and ^our ^passports ^stolen.

**BACKGROUND:** My girlfriend (who we'll call Emily) and I were in Paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in Europe. We spent the whole morning smoking hash at Sacr√©-Coeur with some new friends, who told us that the Euro 2016 final between France and Portugal was that night. They told us to meet them to watch the game at the 'fan zone' at the Eiffel Tower but urged us *not to be late,* otherwise we wouldn't get into the 'fan zone.' 

Being jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. We figured we'd head down to the Eiffel Tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.

**THE FUCK UP:** Arriving at the Eiffel Tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. It turns out we are in the [completely wrong place](http://imgur.com/a/8PES8) on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot. 

The first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it's time to leave. 
As we make our way through the crowd I hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. The crowd around us scatters, knocking Emily and I down, where a **tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces**. 

""Get up! We have to go!"" I'm screaming at Emily but I notice she's crying &amp; screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that **her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on Mars.** I throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the Pont d'Iena bridge, where some guy **snatches Emily's phone out of her hand**. I turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, Emily screaming ""he took my phone!"" 

""Fuck the phone!"" I run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. I need to get her to an ambulance, but I can't leave her to find one, so I need someone to help me. So I start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that I am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. Nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so I pick her up and run as far as I can and set her down again. A crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend's knee and staring at me blankly as I shout shit they don't understand like ""911! AMBULANCE!"" 

It's then I am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from Emily's purse to my back pocket, and I slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as I do so, screaming ""FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" I look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young African guy who loads up and punches me in the face, **shattering my nose**. As blood spurts out of my nose I look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment ""are you fucking kidding me?"" He looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. I scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives. 

I'm now running on what I am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. Brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. I'm bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend's lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. I am pretty sure we are going to die. 

Suddenly I'm joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry Emily and encouraging us in French or some other language which we didn't speak. It occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point I don't even care.  Our new friend's intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (For a while I couldn't tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. I'll never forget him.)

A bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. As police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, I begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. With fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing Emily in the backseat while I jumped in the trunk.

They got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our ID. It's then we realized that, as if we weren't having a bad day already, **our passports had been stolen.**

We ended up at a hospital outside Paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend's knee and didn't touch my nose which was fine with me. It's still crooked. Luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. I still smell tear gas sometimes when I see  Eiffel Tower pictures &amp; trinkets. Good times!

tl;dr (again): Was late to the Eiffel tower to watch Euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend's knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.

**EDIT:** Since people are pointing out how I mentioned that the guy who punched me was African, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, I'd like to add that my entire day in Paris was spent hanging out with African guys who showed me more hospitality than I have found almost anywhere else in the world. I hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the African population in Paris is. I harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but I also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like ""those thugs should burn in hell"" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.

EDIT2: if the Alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because I called the guy African would fuck off, that would be great :)

"TIFU by stripping naked at -40F in Alaska


Obligatory ""this was a couple weeks ago,"" but it's actually -30F outside right now too. I'll try to make this short and leave details for questions in the comments.

Fairbanks AK has a tradition where you strip down to your underwear (or bathing suit, whatever) when it gets -40F (-40C) or colder, and take a picture by the [UAF temperature sign.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0A8l4gexmpk/TyXXN5zXl9I/AAAAAAAAF6M/Uss9RRreIFE/s1600/kids+at+fairbanks+.jpg)

So, it hit -40F recently, and I wanted a photo. My roommate was supposed to go with me, but bailed out last minute. So I went by myself.

I arrived at the location, stripped down to my boxers in my car, and yelled out the window to a random dude outside who was taking pictures for people (he was in full arctic winter gear). He agreed to take mine, I threw him my phone and ran out of my car to the sign.

Took the picture, and ran faster than lightspeed back to my car. Get to my car door... door locked, keys in the ignition. It's -40C out and I'm almost naked. I frantically ran around until someone let me in their car to warm up. Due to the cold, my phone died. I have no ones numbers memorized. I was in serious trouble. 

Well, I go to the U. The building I associate with most was right up the hill from the sign. I had a spare key for my car in an office. However, it is inaccessible by direct road, so having someone drive me there was not an option. It was either someone drops me off at the closest point, or I run there in the cold (almost same distance). I didn't know these people and felt incredibly awkward, so I ran for it. 

2 minutes of blistering cold wind surrounding my uninsulated body. It was the worst feeling you could ever possibly feel temperature-wise.

I get to the outside door, and I couldn't stop shaking. I could barely open the door at all. All my skin was numb. There was a breezeway heater (which pump out a lot of heat), so I laid down next to it for a LONG time. I was laying in the hallway, almost naked, at 11PM, probably hypothermic and uncontrollably shaking due to my dumb decision.

When I came to 20 minutes later, I stumbled into the office, opened up Google Contacts on a computer, and called my roommate on the phone. He laughs his ass off, calls me an idiot, and comes to pick me up. Brings me some clothes to wear on the walk back. Saved my life.

So yeah. Don't run outside when its below 0F, nevermind -40F.

**TL;DR: Wanted to take a picture at a temperature sign at -40C. Phone died, locked my keys in my car, ran to the closest building 2 minutes away with only underwear on. Dealt with possible hypothermia, and a good story to boot.**

"TIFU Accidental LSD Breakfast


Ok, so obligatory long time ago in a dimension far, far away...I was 22 years old and living in a sharehouse with my SO and another girl. The housemate was away for the weekend at a dance party, so I was enjoying a rare morning to myself.
I woke up early and went to make some breakfast. In the fridge, I noticed the shiny golden wrapper of a delicious Ferraro Rocher hazelnut chocolate treat. Being a somewhat greedy and kind of sneaky 22 year old, I did some quick justification math and figured it was ok if I ate it, as long as I replaced it before my flat mate came home. 
I scoffed the chocolate and went about making coffee. 
Not long after I started feeling a bit light headed...my boyfriend had woken up by this stage and I told him I was feeling weird. I've got epilepsy and at that stage in my life, I used to have a lot of seizures. He asked me if I'd done anything unusual that morning. I said nope, everything was routine....oh except I ate that chocolate the flat mate was stashing. 
He looked me dead in the eye and said, uh what??  I'm like, yeah, you know, the Ferraro Rocher. He looks kind of semi-serious and says in a very calm voice ""ok so don't panic, but there's acid in that chocolate""
I do some quick counting. I reckon I've got maybe 15 mins before it kicks in properly. 
""Uhhhh, do you know how many doses?""
My boyfriend pats my hand, says ""just 1. Maybe 2. Tops"" 
I figure it's too late to panic. I quickly got some fresh pjs, had a quick shower and turned on the Teletubbies. Before the creepy baby sun giggled and said hello, I was tripping balls and it was barely 7.30am. I guess it serves me right for being a sneaky chocolate stealer. 

TL/DR - unknowingly stole LSD-laced chocolate. Got instant psychedelic karma. 

EDIT: some common questions (and sorry about late reply, I dropped this before bed and woke up to boom)
1. How didn't I know and BF did? Cause I'm a flaky chick who was apparently told but I don't recall that. 
2. Yes I replaced the acid
3. It wasn't that strong TBH - really only Teletubbies and Daft Punk worthy. We're not talking bleeding prisms of laser light here people.
4. I'm sure it's the plot of lots of movies. Weird shit happens in sharehouses. 
5. Lying for karma? Lol. I don't care about fake internet points. It's a funny story I thought I'd share with you all. I told my mum this story (she's a nurse) she tells EVERYONE, she thinks it's hilarious. 

Edit 2: holy shit did this make it to r/all? "
"TIFU by kidnapping two people


My mom invited people who were visiting from England over to her house and asked me to pick them up. My mom lives about an hour away and my apartment is close to the visiting relatives. She sends me an address and I proceed to said address. Now mind you I've never seen these people before in person but she told me two people were supposed to come over. I get to the house and there are exactly two people standing outside. It's a dad and his five year old-ish son. It's snowing and sleeting outside and I roll my window down to tell them to come in. The dad says something and I just say ""yeah yeah, I'm here for you just come in!""

They get into the car and we immediately start talking like we should know each other. He tells me his phone is dead so he couldn't call the people he was supposed to see and confirm the pick-up (I assumed he was talking about my mom). He asks me if he could plug his phone into the USB and I'm like sure. Then he proceeds to ask me about me and my life. He asks if I know my native language and I laugh and say I know enough (spoiler: apparently not well enough). He then keeps mentioning the word ""Munjor"". Every time he said it he was like ""Munjor Bhai"" (which translates to Brother Munjor) but I didn't pay close attention -- I had an hour drive ahead of me. Then we keep talking about how he is trying to learn English himself and is trying to get his little boy accustomed to the English language. He is trying really hard for people at home to start speaking it. 

Then he mentions how excited he is about the car ""Munjor Bhai"" is going to show him. At that point I was ten minutes into the drive and already on the highway and it finally hit me. And I ask him what does ""Munjor"" mean? He tells me it's a person's name. At that point I'm like that‚Äôs a weird name to call my mom. And he goes, ""Mom? Isn't that your uncle?"" At that point I'm like what the crap. I go down a list of family members in my house to see if he maybe recognizes them. He does not. We both have a puzzled look on our faces. His child is really scared at that point. He asked his dad, ""Dad who is this man driving us?""

Then I decide to call my mom to clear it up. Turns out I picked up the wrong two people and I had in fact picked up two total strangers. My mom asked me who I had in the car and I was like I had no idea with a super nervous laugh.

I hang up and tell them I was way sorry. The fear in their eyes -- I'll never forget it. I took the nearest U-turn and brought them home. Turns out the people I was supposed to pick up lived a floor below the people I actually picked up.

**Edit:** Front page of Reddit! Thanks guys for the up votes and comments -- definitely a bucket list item -- you're all awesome! :)

**Edit #2:** I think the biggest red flag was that they were from England and didn't have the cool accent. I'll remember this for next time!

TLDR; I accidentally picked up two strangers I wasn't supposed to and almost drove them an hour from their home."
"TIFU by getting electrocuted by KFC Wet Wipes


So this actually happened today.

I was hungry around lunch and thought that I'd get some KFC after seeing all the new deals on TV. Anyway, I bought it, ate it, nothing interesting there. But a little later on I noticed a bunch of those wet wipes that come with the meal just sitting on my desk. I didn't even need to use one, but I got bored and decided to open one... with my electric plasma lighter. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it's a lighter which uses two arcs of electricity instead of a flame.

Yeah, stupid decision already but what I hadn't realized/remembered is that the inner side of the wet wipes were lined with a metal which I assume is aluminum. It doesn't look like it from the outside though, rather like paper. In hindsight it makes sense to prevent moisture from getting out, but this is Today I Fucked Up not Today I Made a Conscientious Decision, so I stupidly decided to try and hold one side of the packet, while zapping the other end with my plasma lighter.

The moment I did that I got a huge jolt (much worse than I would have thought from something like a lighter) and threw both the lighter and the packet down and clenched my hand in pain. I think I'm going to go vegan now.

TL;DR: Tried to open a KFC wet wipe packet with electricity, got jolted and probably broke my lighter.

EDIT: Front page of Reddit, you guys are amazing! Also, I'm not actually going vegan, that was just a joke but thanks for the advice anyway!"
"TIFU How should I tell my wife I lost all of our savings?

"TIFU by volunteering to be a foster home for the Humane Society. Signed up to receive 4 - 6 kittens, came home with 8 puppies.


Sorry for formatting. My intranet at work is terrible for Reddit and image hosting. I'll add with mobile later. 

Last May, two friends and I signed up to foster a litter of kittens from the local shelter. We chose kittens because they're low maintenance in respect to puppies. We have a good place to do it, love animals, and have the time. So we walked into the shelter, signed up, received a background check, and then told to standby. On June 1st we got the call. We were so excited. The clerk informed us that they did not have kittens, but puppies. We discussed amongst ourselves and agreed we could do 4 puppies instead of kittens. When we arrived, they brought us straight into a room with 8 puppies hobbling around and squeaking. They were 2-3 weeks old. 3-5 pounds each. Their mother had died. A vet technician was bottle feeding one. Our hearts melted. 

We asked which we would be taking. The Vtech looked at us weird and said, ""Well, the whole litter I would hope."" 8 puppies 1 litter. Just then the manager walks in and thanks us for volunteering. He goes on to explain that the shelter currently had a terrible parvo outbreak and their quarantine ward was overflowing. If we only took 4, the rest would likely die. 

So off we went, in a Nissan Altima with a bucket of puppies. 

The next six weeks we raised the puppies until they were old enough to be spayed/neutered. (The vet said that was at 8 weeks, I recognize some find that a little premature). We started with formula and bottles, then soft food (dry food mixed with water) and then dry food. 

Our main issues were containment and clean up. 8 puppies can eat and excrete more than you can imagine.

To contain them, we started with a caged off area inside the house. Mistake. After 3 days, we didn't sleep much as they all woke up every 4-6 hours. It was clear the floor would be ruined due to excrement. I then constructed a cage using 2 plastic kiddie pools stacked on top of each other. This worked until the pups learned to pile bodies on one side permitting 2-3 puppers to climb the pile of fluff and escape. This small cage also quickly filled with waste, despite changing the puddle pads hourly. It was small, so they would then roll in their filth. The plan briefed well, and looked cool, but didn't work out. Phase 3 was the back porch. We hung chicken wire around the posts and put up 3 foot baby gates by the stairs. They were trapped. The area is 6'x10'. Plenty of space. Half of it is covered. Wood floors. We power washed it every day while they got their baths. Success! Cleaning them was the largest problem. I won't go into too much detail unless asked. Just... poo. Everywhere. 

The house was wrecked and smelled for a considerable time. The deck was chewed up. The cat was so stressed she lost hair. 

I still adopted one of the bastards. 

TL;DR Wanted to try out fostering, starting with an easy job. Went from 4 to 8 real quick. 

Shoutout to u/WinterKappa for animating and narrating our story!

The only edit: Thank you for the gold! 
Thank you all for your kind words! I couldn't respond to all of you, but I damn well tried. You guys made my day and made me feel awesome. 
If you feel inclined to adopt, go to your nearest shelters. 
If you want to donate, look toward Armani's Angels in Columbia Missouri. They helped us a ton when Dipstick required emergency surgery.

"TIFU by accidently using my sisters toothbrush as a viborator


For very obvious reasons this is a throwaway. 

Alright.  I know what you're thinking how can you use a tooth brush by accident... well... 

I am embarassed to say that this is probably the most humiliating thing I have ever experienced. It also happened less than 10 minutes ago and was a complete and total accident. So I use a vibrating toothbrush to do my business. Ya I know. Not smart. But the economy is shit and I just got laid off, get off my back. Plus it's a hell of a lot more discrete than lugging around a giant black dildo .

Anyways, so I'm staying at my parents house this week and I thought hey let's bring Lil miss pussy scrubber, because you never know. So I'm laying in bed and I decided to do my business but I couldn't find my toothbrush. Remembering I put it in my overnight bag that was in the bathroom I went to grab it. I should have thought it was weird that it was sitting on the counter and not in my bag but I was clouded by my sex hormones and the drive to make myself cum. 

Alright so I'm in my room, did my business, start getting dressed when I notice an odd smell. Not like a foul, I need to go to the doctor smell... but more like my vag smelt like it just went to the dentist. That's when I realize what I just did. So I start to panic. I grab the toothbrush run out of my room and into the bathroom to throw it out and pretend to never have encountered this. Well that's when my sister decided to walk into the bathroom, saw me holding her toothbrush,  grabbed it from my hands and started putting toothpaste on it. (We have the same color of toothbrush, but she wouldn't have known as I don't display my pleasure tool to everyone).

Now I know what you're thinking... Yeah right. This wouldn't happen... I SWEAR ON MY GRANDMOTHER'S GRAVE I WATCHED MY SISTER BRUSH HER TEETH WITH MY VAG JUICE. 

I froze. I couldn't say or do anything. I just panicked. I left the room. And now I'm sitting in my room shaking because I'm the world worst sister. 

This is something I will take to my grave.

Tl;dr: accidently used sisters toothbrush instead of my regular Lil miss pussy scrubber = total embarrassment.

[Edit] 1: she's looking for her toothbrush. She thinks she misplaced it. Omg. It's bed time. 

[Edit] 2: omg this totally blew up. Jesus. R.i.p inbox. I am so high right now laughing my ass off at how popular this is that she's asking me why I'm laughing and I told her the story as if it was someone else. Hahahshaha I have to put her toothbrush back so she doesn't notice. 

Sorry I can't reply everyone. I've never seen so many messages. Ahhhhhhh. This is amazing. Thanks guys. Made my day :). Off to bed goodnight!

Edit 3: alright.  I'm gonna answer some questions that everyone is asking. My vag smelt minty because I used a toothbrush that was previously used with toothpaste. My toothbrush has never had tooth paste on it. So when I smelt the toothpaste I realized my mistake.

You use the toothbrush bristles up and the flat part on your clit. People keep asking how my vag juice got all over the bristles then... and to those people: you've very obviously never fucked a vagina. Because the juices get everywhere people. 

Thank you to everyone wanting to buy me vibrators and dildos. Or sending me links to cheap ones. Will probably order one at this point.

Also apparently my edits don't make sense. After she brushed her teeth I stole her toothbrush back to replace it so I never had to wonder if my vag juice was still on the brush each time she used it. She then went to look for it as it was bed time and she needed to brush her teeth. Because I was laughing so hard at the story I had to tell her what it was. But I changed the details. I then had to put her toothbrush back before she put two and two together. My sister is very ditzy. And wouldn't have notice that her toothbrush isn't where she left it because she would just think she misplaced it. When I told her the story she thought it was the funniest thing. Brushed her teeth and never ever noticed. 

When I put her toothbrush back I put it in her room with her make up stuff she was trying to put away as it was the only place she didn't look. She's quirky. She wouldn't think twice. She was also high during the whole thing and thought she was just tripping out.  She never ever would think this actually happened. She would think I made it up. So I think it's safe to say I'm in the clear. And this horrifying event can be put behind me

Final: I am in the clear. Moving on like it never happened. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes. I can't believe how much this blew up. I will still try to answer everyone. But otherwise. Good day.  Thanks for listening to the most embarrassing story ever. "
"TIFU by trying a jacuzzi with my GF on valentine's day (pic inside, SFW)


So my gf and I managed to snag a deal staying at a hotel and getting dinner on valentine's day, and we both got so excited when we saw the spa-bath jacuzzi in our room, even though it was a bit small.

We DID notice the warning sign about being cautious about keeping body parts away from the intake area, but didn't think it was very important (mistake).

After it finally filled up, we turned the jets on and she hopped in, and there was barely room for two, but I tried squeezing in opposite her. As I got comfortable, I suddenly felt something strange happen. It felt like I was in a space ship and a hole had appeared behind me, and my body just tried to plug it. It wasn't painful, it just felt like 15 vacuum cleaners being hooked up at the bottom of my spine, and I immediately pleaded with my gf for help. I probably could have unplugged myself, but with her help I was off the intake hole within 3 seconds, but the damage was done. I stood up and showed her my back, and she erupted in laughter at my new tramp stamp.

She later added that a benefit of the whole ordeal is that if a man is rooting me, my speedometer tramp stamp could tell him how fast he's going.

Aftermath: http://i.imgur.com/aIxM8nHl.jpg (sfw)


TL;DR
Back got sucked into the intake and plugged it, ended with massive bruises in shape of drain."
"TIFU I caused a massive traffic jam while I was grocery shopping.


So this happened many years ago. I went to my local grocery store, parked the car, shopped for about 15/20 minutes, then came out to find my car wasn't where I parked it. I knew it hadn't been towed. (I frequented that plaza often and towing was not an issue.) Maybe it had been stolen. As I considered the headache that would present, an 'uh oh, you fucked up' explanation hit me.

Cut to a few years prior, when very similarly, I went to a store in a plaza and when I came out my car wasn't where I parked it. I ran the reasons in my head but then I looked up. There was my car, way across the other end of the parking lot. Thoroughly confused, I rushed over and got in. It was then I realised what had happened: I had left the car in neutral (it was manual transmission) and forgotten to apply the parking brake. 

Because I had left the steering wheel turned, the car rolled backwards just the way I had pulled in, and proceeded right into another parking spot where it stopped against a fence. How it didn't hit someone, rolled out into emptiness, perfectly slid back into an empty row of parking spots and just rested there, was bizarre.

Cut back to me outside the grocery store. I panicked: had I done it again?! I took a deep breath, looked up, and saw my car. In the middle of the street. It was blocking the two eastbound lanes, and as I moved my eyes to the left I saw a sea of cars, and a bus, sitting in traffic behind it. (To this day, I have such a vivid image of the glow of all those brake and headlights against my on an angle parked in the middle of the street car.)

I didn't have time to process anything. All I knew was that every second I stood there wondering what happened and what I should do was another second all those people in their cars were going to get even more pissed off.

So I just ignored the what would have otherwise been paralyzing embarrassment, and started walking calmly but quickly towards my car, grocery bags in hand. Walked through the parking lot, down the slope to the sidewalk and into the street, up to the car. I was far too embarrassed to look at anyone, so I smiled strangely, opened the door, got in, and drove off. 

I still wonder what I seemed like to them- emerging from the store and acting what possibly appeared nonchalant about having inconvenienced all those people, with a such a strange situation. 'Oh, terribly sorry about having parked in the street again, but it's simply the best spot!' (In your best Mrs. Howell voice.)

I want to add that it's thoroughly bizarre, again, how the car ended up where it did with no harm to people, or cars, including my own. Next time I was at the plaza I had a good look and the car had rolled into the row of parking spots behind it, which managed to be empty, over the concrete parking curb, in between two signs, down a grassy slope, across the sidewalk and into the (main and busy) street where there were no cars, or they were far away enough to be able to stop in time. How all those elements lined up, I'll never know.

Don't worry- I drive an automatic now.

TL;DR I forgot to leave my car in gear and put on the parking brake, and it rolled into the street causing a massive traffic jam- all while I was grocery shopping.

EDIT: Welp, I misremembered the story. I DID apply the parking brake, but didn't leave the car in gear- so when the parking brake wasn't strong enough there was nothing to stop the car from rolling. That was the crucial mistake. A Redditor below made me suddenly realise the circumstance I described made no sense- the car would have 100% rolled immediately, with the slightest incline. It honestly happened so long ago my brain catostrophised everything to idiotic proportions.

TIFU my TIFU post. (And the title, apparently. Thanks to another Redditor for making see that one.) "
"TIFU by giving a young girl a mustard facial


Obligatory this didn't happen today, but this past Sunday, soooo close enough.

I went to the local flea market this past Sunday and while I was there, I decided to get some French Fries from a kiosk. The line was surprisingly long and I ended up waiting approximately 30 mins. 

I finally get to the front of the line, order food for myself, my girlfriend, and one of my buddies, and while I am waiting to pay, I get some ketchup from the pump that is to my right, next to the ordering window. I notice that it's pretty difficult to pump ketchup out, but pay no mind.

A minute later, a young girl of maybe 14-16 years of age, asks me for help with pumping the ketchup out for her, so I say ""Sure, I gotcha"". She thanks me and asks for help with the mustard as well, so I proceed to pump the mustard and like the ketchup dispenser, it was difficult to press the pump mechanism down.

I press a little harder and POP! The nozzle flies out of the pump mechanism which frees the pump up to blast a fat amount of mustard out and onto the girls ENTIRE face! It's in her hair, and on her shirt.

I'm so mortified and in shock that I'm just standing next to her saying ""I'm so sorry!"" I pick up the nozzle instead of wiping her face, and when my fries came out, I opted to eat a couple while still standing next to her... I have no idea what was going through my mind at the time.

I had a great story for when I came into work the next day though, so there's that.

TL;DR pumped mustard bukake onto an underage girl

Edit: The girl was a good sport about it, when I said sorry, she told me it was okay.

For everyone that is offended by the sexually themed jokes, that's all they are, jokes that I used for imagery. I didn't mean to offend anyone."

"TIFU By sounding like a racist asshole to one of the world's best chefs


This happened about 2 hours ago. I was just able to pick up my head from shame.

Imported to know: My SO has been feeling pretty down lately and for the oddest reason it makes her laugh whenever she calls me and I answer with a stereotypical asian accent. You know like ""a harro? Rike who is dis? Noo-dawls "" Put emphasis on it, slap a sticker on it and call it a day. Makes her giggle a bit. She always calls from her office phone and I never save her number because it just calls back the receptionist, I just recognize the area code, assume it's her and answer...the way I answer. This will be important later.

I live in an area where there's a bunch of michelin starred and world renowned restaurants around me. We're talking like 500 bucks a person. I worked as a cook at one of these restaurants and like any industry if you make connections in a place like this doors open EVERYWHERE. Germany, France, Denmark, Rome, all these were now places I could easily get to because of the impressions I made and the people I met. I was a happy clam. I'm good at cooking, I really am. Restaurants like this require you to be. At work I don't joke around, have a straight face and stern voice because if they hear you having fun, they rip you a new asshole. Anyway it's time for me to leave this chapter and move onto the next. I let the chef know and he basically tells me name the place and we'll get you there. It was another world renowned Chef, asian chef who does amazing asian food, fucking badass this guy is an absolute legend in the area. Chef says no problem, we're buddies. I'll let him know about you.

**I'M FUCKING STOKED**

A couple days pass and it's my day off. My phone is charging and it goes buzz buzz. I run over and see the familiar area code, but today was special. It's Valentine's day and I REALLY wanted to go the extra mile and cheer her up because it sucks to work valentine's day.  I pick up the phone and I fucking go for it... "" OHHHH UH HARRO PREASE!!! WHAT YOU OR-DUH PREASE? YOU RIKE A DA PORK BERRY STEW WIT A DOG PAW BWOTH? I RIKE STEAM BUN!! RICE RICE RICE OOOOOOoooOOOOOoooooOOOooooooOOOOoooo.... BWONNNGGGGGG...."" Silence on her end I usually hear laughter. So I say ""hello?""  After about 2 seconds of silence my heart begins to drop... after one more second I hear a voice that is not my SO, but a man's voice. He responded with "" Hello, this is chef ______ from world famous restaurant, is this 2glamtogiveadamn?""
I just about shit myself my heart sank so low it hurt me physically... I could only muster up enough words to say ""Oh my God I'm so sorr-"" ""Okay"" -click-  He hung up.

The events that unfolded was what really fucked me. The chef called my boss and he was understandably pretty pissed. My boss calls me and tells me to grab my equipment and leave. Also they emailed all of their surrounding famous Chef buddies about me and what I did so I'm really fucked moving forward. All the contacts I established are essentially useless now. I fucked all my hard work and now I look like fucking scum and a joke, and in this industry I have no idea how it will affect me when I move forward. 

TL;DR: Proclaimed my love of rice to the wrong person


Edit- added some clarification on a few things. Yes the karma hammer bashed me in the skull. Pretty hard. There's not much more I can do but laugh at myself for it because it was pretty stupid. Lesson learned, stay classy.

"TIFU by not knowing micro/nano SIM cards existed


so after 'using' a completely broken crappy iphone clone for many many years now I finally decided to get a proper, fully functional android phone.

said phone arrived about an hour ago and of course I jumped straight into setting it up. When it came time to pop the SIM card in I was confused that it didnt seem to fit in the slideout tray. I took a glance at the instructions and saw the tiny SIM pictured taking up half a tray but I decided to assume that meant the other half sat outside the tray. At this point I knew something was up but I decided there'd be no harm in trying. Big mistake.

The SIM card slipped in and my recovery attempts only served to push it in further, until it was jammed deep inside. faffing about with paperclips for 30 minutes didn't get me anywhere so I decided to see if anyone else on the internet had been as dumb as I was.



I came across a tip to remove it that sounded perfect! heating up a needle and sticking it inside the card? What could go wrong!?

Long story short, the SIM card seems to be in 3 pieces and melted into the slot and the phone has no removeable cover. Guess I'll have to be the guy with no phone number for another 5 years.

---------------------
tl;dr: melted a SIM card into my brand new phones sim+sd slot while all the accessories are still on their way to me. Gotta come up with excuses for why I still can't be contacted via mobile."
"TIFU By carrying a firearm on a Tinder date


So this happened about two years ago. 

I met a girl via Tinder and we txted and snaped for about a week before I invited her out to dinner at a nice restaurant downtown. 

Now let me give you a tad of back story about myself: I did four years enlisted in the military. Nothing crazy, just turned wrenches, then got out and went back to school. I continued to reside in a state where with proper training and certification - a person is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm within specific boundary of course. While working at a firearms dealer as a sales associate and instructor. My firearm is like my billfold; After 7 years of carrying, it becomes a natural accessory. (I understand that there is a vast majority of viewpoints on this topic, especially on Reddit, but I'm just giving you mine). 

So we agree to meet up at the restaurant that I made reservations for. Dinner comes, and to be honest - the date wasn't going THAT well. We didn't have very much in common, she was pretty opinionated about her ideas, where I just prefer to let people have their opinions and try not to sweat the stuff I can't control. Also, this girl was a political science major (if that explains anything). So, we get on the topic of the military (you can already feel it coming, cant you..?) Low and behold, she takes it upon herself to inform me how wrong certain aspects of our armed forces are. Now don't get me wrong, she had some perspectives that I agreed with, but whenever I chimed in there was no understanding. It was: ""You're dead wrong, and this is why...""
I should also mention that this IS one of few topics where I do get a little defensive. I dedicated some time to the idea of serving my Country (whether certain aspects are flawed or not) and when someone condemns me for it, it tends to get to me. Sue me.

Alright, so here's where it gets good, or bad. We get on the topic of firearm control. I explain my immersive background, and finally she asks: ""well are you carrying a gun right now?"". (Be honest - you knew this was coming)
To which I reply: ""idk, are you wearing underwear?"" ...she didn't like that very much. Right after that, she says: ""why would you bring a gun to a restaurant!?"" (Like we are talking normal conversation volume) and I say: ""who said I had a firearm?"".
So I talk it down (that took about five minutes) and proceed to get the check. Very displeased, she goes to the restroom, we meet at the front, and start to walk out. 

As soon as we get through the door, we are greeted by a convoy of patrol cars lining the street in front of the restaurant. I waive at the police officers but they do that thing where they walk towards me from all directions and say ""Sir, can you come here for a second"" (hand on firearm). 

Now a lot of the gentlemen I worked with at that time were sheriff deputies making extra money teaching concealed classes at the range. You talk to them enough, and you realize that in every situation regarding interaction with a police officer, things can go very ""not in your best interest"" if you decide not to comply. I knew this. I'm stupid. The first officer informs me that there was a complaint of that someone had a firearm in the restaurant and it was making people feel unsafe. He then asks me: ""Sir, are you carrying a firearm?"" My common sense boards a fucking plane to Nigeria and I come back with: ""I don't believe I am lawfully required to answer that question. Am I being detained, or am I free to go?"". My date (who was being interrogated by a few police officers about 10ft from me) about shit herself. She finally says: ""just let them have it"".... Fuck. Me.
Immediately the officers un-strap their holsters and demand that I now put my hands behind my back. Common sense finally comes rushing back and I reply: ""yes Sir, officer. My Apologies"".

I was handcuffed, firearm removed, put in the back of a patrol car for the better part of 30min until everything finally cleared.
So through conversation with the officers I was able to explain the situation and because of the fact that there were some veterans in the group - we bonded a bit, and I learned that some high school barback heard ""why did you bring a gun to a restaurant?"" freaked out and called the cops - can't blame 'em. 
 So Because my date had left already, and the fact that I had walked to the restaurant since I lived three blocks away, I was given the option the take my (now unloaded) firearm to walk, or receive a ride home from my new friends. Whom I actually gave my card to and Sold one of them a nice lil 9mm shield a couple moths after.  When they dropped me off the officer rolled down his window and said: wait, don't forget these"" as he dumped my ammunition rounds into my hand. Life is fucking weird guys.

Apologized to my match, got no reply, deleted her info. and moved on with life.
If you made it this far - thanks for reading (thumbs up emoji)

TL;DR
Brought a concealed firearm on a Tinder date. I'm ex-military. Firearm control topic came up. She was a political science major. Someone overheard her ask me why I brought a gun to a restaurant. That someone called the police. Police show up, handcuff me, clear me, then give me a ride home since I walked. 

Edit: typo. Edit: corrected misspelling."

"TIFU by not knowing what a 'space cake' was


It's that time of year again and this is a story I will always remember from about six years ago. Now I have many, many, many stories like these so if you find this one funny I'll share some more - cos if you fuck up, the one positive is that it can always make someone else laugh at you.

So I was really into this chick from high school. Natural tan, huge boobs, long brunette hair and amazing figure. She must have been fucking filthy, the way she presented herself. You get the idea.

So we were chatting about plans for the night. She was gonna be making this thing called a 'space cake' for valentines day and myself and some of her female friends and their significant others would be invited to her house to celebrate Valentine's day and ""share the love"".

Now being innocent 15 year old me I had absolutely no idea what a space cake was or how it was made, but to impress the little stunner I straight away volunteered to go to the shopping centre to get the ingredients for her. Then I would meet her at her house before her friends got there and help her make the cake - you see where this is going?

She was buzzed up at the idea and, feeling giddy that I may have a chance at getting into her pants, I hurried off after school to pick up the ingredients for this space cake, before arriving at her front door with a cheeky smile and a bag of groceries.

She was really happy and gave me a hug for paying for the stuff and making things easy for her. Then she proceeded to look in the bag.

""What the fuck is this!?"" she asked me, her brilliant smile receding to a mixture of confusion, dismay, and disappointment.

""Stuff for a space cake, you know for tonight?"" I answered quietly, not sure what the problem was.

""No, I meant..."" she sighed. ""Bless you, you're a proper fucking moron you know that?""

I still wasn't any the wiser. 

""Shall we get baking?"" I asked, trying to see past her comments out of pure awkwardness.

""You're not coming in here now!"" she laughed and shook her head at me. ""Go find something else to do, dude... just stay away for a few days, yeah?""

I squinted my eyes and gave a puzzled look. She pointed at her front gate and nodded, signaling that my chances with her were over. Not knowing what I had done wrong I hesitantly strolled away from her home, a few miles across town and back to my house to sulk and play Call of Duty on my lonesome.

I was the subject of so much banter that week at school, and it was only through a friend taking pity on me that everything clicked into place.

I thought a 'space cake' was a space themed sponge cake, like what you give a young kid for their birthday. A space cake needs weed, a plastic tub for making the butter and a good amount of brownie mix. The grocery bag I turned up at her house with contained sponge mix, jam and icing decorations from Disney Pixar's Toy Story in the shape of Buzz Lightyear, the pizza planet rockets and the little green aliens.

Safe to say I fucked up one of biggest chances from my school years.

TL:DR - Had no idea what a space cake was, tried to impress a crush by thinking I knew, got rejected with a vengeance."
