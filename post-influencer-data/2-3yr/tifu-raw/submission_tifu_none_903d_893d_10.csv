"TIFU by almost getting run over by a car trying to hide my junk from my sister.


So I'll bet the title has you a bit confused so I'll get right to it. I'm 15 and my sister is 17. Every spring we celebrate the departure of cold weather with water balloon fights. It recently got pretty warm where I'm at meaning it was time for us to go at it again. 

This all happened three days ago. We filled up the water balloons and were in our bathing suits outside and we started throwing them at each other. We had been at it for maybe ten minutes, and my sister had a good fifteen water balloons left when I had already ran out. She started pegging me, and I ran away from her which happened to be towards the street. We were in our backyard which is filled with trees. I was running away from her and my swim trunks got caught on a sharp branch sticking out from a tree and they tore straight off. 

Now idk about other guys, but I don't wear boxers under my swim trunks (the netting basically serves as the same thing) so there I was butt naked in my backyard. I went into full-on panic mode, not thinking at all, and I ran to the street away from her trying to cover myself in hopes that she didn't see anything.  My plan was to get across the street and into the tall grass (there's an empty lot on the other side of the street) and wait there for her to toss me something to wear. This is where it all went even more south.

As I was running I heard my sister scream my name. I stopped to look back at her when I realized there was a truck coming down the road. I immediately dove back into our yard and my leg got clipped by the bull-bar on the front of the truck. I also managed to smack my head on the ground pretty hard. The next thing I knew my sister was standing over me very worried, and when I opened my eyes she was relieved. She told me to stay put, got my torn trunks from the tree branch, and then covered my privates and helped me up. I couldn't hardly stand even on my healthy leg, and she ended up basically supporting all my weight over her shoulder while covering me at the same time. Once we got inside she laid me on the couch and got a towel for me to cover myself with, and then called my parents. They were both at work so my sister got me some clothes, helped me to her car, and took me to the hospital where my parents met up with us. I ended up having a fractured shin and a concussion. 

I was lucky my sister saw the truck, because in the split second I looked at it I saw the girl driving was on her phone and not paying attention, and had no idea I was even there. I'm lucky that my sister is amazing because she basically saved my butt in this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: I was having a water balloon fight with my sister, my trunks got torn by a tree, I ran to hide my junk from my sister and ended up running into the street with a truck coming, and my sister got my attention so that I had enough time to get out of the road, and the truck clipped me leaving me with a concussion and a fractured shin. And in the end my sister ended up seeing my junk anyways so it was all to no avail. 

EDIT: I'm going to ask you all to please stop with the ""pegging"" and ""going at it"" comments. I used poor word choice and tbh the jokes are becoming pretty stale. But feel free to make one if you feel you have to. "
"TIFU by underestimating apple cider vinegar


This occurred within the past 24 hours and could be subtitled, Adventures in Health: a Cautionary Tale

So I've had Apple Cider Vinegar on the edge of my radar for awhile, but never looked into it very deeply. My wife recently picked up a bottle of it to help with some gastric issues my son was having, but only used a teaspoon or so out of it so it was just sitting on the kitchen counter.

Flash forward to a little while ago when I was closing up the house for bed and noticed it. I need to give that a try I mused, then hopped on my phone and did a quick search on recommended methods. Yadda, yadda, so many parts per ounces of water... add a pinch and dash of so and so...in the words of Sweet Brown, ""Ain't nobody got time for that."" So I grabbed a Dixie cup and poured two fingers. 

Not being a total fool, I took a preparatory sip and although it had a bite, it didn't seem too bad. I did the next logical thing that people who never read directions fully tend to do...pinched my nose and tipped that sucker back. At first, I just got a little bit of the Holy Ghost and did the shimmy shakes, but they passed after a few seconds and I felt okay aside from the extremely pungent aftertaste.

Hey, you remember those science fair volcanos you used to make in elementary school that you fill with baking soda and food coloring, then at the last possible second, douse with a cup of vinegar before running for cover as the bubbling ooze endlessly pours from the top?  That's a really useful metaphor for my story because my baking soda stomach decided that it didn't appreciate an apple cider vinegar bath and, well, I'll spare you the details except to say that the leftover pizza I ate for lunch then wished that I hadn't was no longer an issue for my digestive system. Unfortunately, the myriad of snacks and tonight's dinner was blocking its path down the mountain, but the geyser of apple cider vinegar erupting up my esophagus convinced everything else in my stomach that life would be better down the metaphorical mountain too.

The edges of my vision went dark and I saw a tunnel of light which I doggy paddled along the ether to reach, which transported me to a place made of light. A figure approached out of the mist and I immediately recognized him as Jesus. He knelt and gently took me by the hand and slapped the back of my head and said, ""What were you thinking?"" Then everything started to fade.

I became acutely aware of the smell of sulphur and a rising burning sensation in my body, but as my vision cleared I realized that I hadn't indeed been catapulted into the lower reaches of Heck (reserved for the headstrong and hasty), but I was just feeling the after effect of my stomach's sudden rebellion. I'm currently able to walk again, although my stomach is a bit jumpy and the back of my throats feels like it's been run over a cheese grater.

If you have enjoyed this story up until now, I urge you to keep your eyes peeled for my soon to be released bestseller, ""Better Bulimia Through Apple Cider Vinegar."" It promises to be a hard hitting read.

TL;DR Threw back a shot of apple cider vinegar; chaos ensued."

"TIFU by submitting porn for my religion assignment


EDIT: It was gay porn. Just when you thought it couldn't be worse...

So every second term in my high school, we have to submit an assignment for religious studies (and often other subjects, but consistently religion). This term, it was a pretty large task involving multiple text documents, mp3s and movies. I won't bore you with the specifics, but I had the idea to use a folder to keep all my progress together and eventually submit. At the same time, I had no laptop and needed a space to store porn because our bandwidth was low (I had to recycle videos a bit. I'm a teenager, going without is not a possibility.).

My family's computer used one account because my father was convinced multiple would use up too much data (sigh), so I decided I would store everything in a folder in the religion folder- who would check there for juicy stuff, right? Of course, I would take it out before I submitted it online.

Today, when I got my marks back and saw a 0/20, my heart dropped and I knew exactly what happened. My religion teacher pulled me aside at the end of the lesson and told me I was getting detention every week for the rest of the term as punishment for this 'sick joke.' My parents were informed, and our family computer was moved to the TV room; my account was also locked out past 8pm.

TL:DR; Submitted a folder that coincidentally also contained porn for a religion assignment, got a term of detention.

UPDATE: For clarification, during the period from submission to getting my marks back I ended up creating new accounts for my whole family because my mother was annoyed that stuff I downloaded (utorrent, etc) was starting up whenever she got on the computer."
"TIFU by sneaking a spaghetti sandwich into the movie theater


Last week, my friend said he wanted to see Rogue One and asked if I would come along. Star Wars isn't really my thing, but I might as well go cuz I have nothing else to do. I'm a hungry guy, so I tried to figure out what I'd sneak in. I decide that candy wouldn't be enough, it was time to try something new. My mom made spaghetti the night before, and it's my favorite food. So, I put some in a plastic bag as well as two pieces of bread in another bag. My friend doesn't notice, and we finally get into the theater. The lights go down and [POSSIBLE SPOILERS] the blind guy fight scene begins. I whip out the food and start eating it. A security guard comes by and sees me. Eating a spaghetti sandwich. He says ""Sir, you can't bring outside food into the theater."" I say, ""I didn't. I bought this at the front stand."" He says, ""I'll go check, if it's not there, your movie is over."" As soon as the guard leaves, I bolt to the door at the back of the theater room. It didn't say emergency exit or anything on it, so when an alarm screeched, it scared the crap out of me. The sandwich was still in my hand, so I took a bite and all the people flood out of the theater. When the police arrive, I have to explain that I was eating a spaghetti sandwich and set off the alarm because I panicked and tried to leave. I'm formally banned from the theater, and my friend got banned for a week for ""being an accomplice.""

TL;DR: I snuck food into the theater, when a guard saw, I ran out the emergency exit by accident, and I'm banned from the theater now."
"TIFU by hiding ""fuck"" in my school yearbook


&gt;Obligatory ""not actually today""

About one-third of the way through my 8th grade year, I, being in the yearbook class was having a good time interviewing others and writing things for pages. One day, my friend, (Frank, to keep anonymity) was assigned the Robotics Club page. Frank isn't the best at writing conventionally, so he came to me to see if his main body paragraph looked OK. 
&gt;01010001010110! Welcome to Robotics Club, where you can...

&gt;etc.

I notice the string of binary code at the beginning and ask him if it means something.
&gt;no, I just mashed my keyboard with ones and zeros.

I then suggest to frank that it actually says something.

I show him an ASCII to binary converter website and he is a little bit confused on how to use it. So, I show him how to use the website, trying different words and numbers. He says
&gt;How about we make it say ""hello?""

The smartass inside of me thought it was a good Idea to have it say something else, so I put the funniest thing a new eighth grader could think of. I type ""fuck"" into the generator while he isn't looking then quickly use inspect element to change ""fuck"" in the input field to ""hello"". Thinking that nobody would ever notice, I left it alone and just assumed he caught on and changed it.

Fast-Forward to about three-quarters through the year, book is done and has been sent to publisher. I had forgotten about this series of events, and Frank had put it into the yearbook. One day, Frank is called down to the main office. Our yearbook teacher gives the entire class a lecture on what is and isn't acceptable in the book. The next day, I get called in. Frank told the principal that I wrote the binary, and that he legit thought it said ""hello"". 

I was booted from that class, and my name removed from the bylines. I had to confess my mistake in front of the entire Yearbook class, and basically spent my 6th period in the counselor's office for the rest of the year.

**TL;DR**  Friend wanted some binary code for his yearbook page, I put fuck instead of hello, had to apologize and spent rest of year with counselor."
"TIFU by switching on a lamp and sneezing


I was working in the lab a few hours ago using a UVA lamp (basically a black light) which is a rather dim light source that essentially leaves me working in the dark. Once I'd finished up with the lamp, I sat at my desk and completely blinded myself by switching on the regular and much brighter desk lamp.

Fun Fact about OP; having a bright light shone in my eyes makes me sneeze.

Repeatedly. 

Like 11 or 12 times in a row (current record is 17). It's particularly bad after spending a few hours in the dark.

So I sneeze.

Hard.

And smash my face off the desk

Which doesn't stop the sneezing; didn't even slow it down really. Instead it busted my nose open. 

I tried to cover my nose with my hands and get to the toilets while still sneezing but that basically made things worse. A dozen or so sneezes later and my little corner of the lab looks like a Jackson Pollock painting, there's a small trail of blood all the way to the toilets, bloody hand marks on the lab doors and I look like an extra from the Walking Dead.

**TL;DR: Switching on a lamp made me sneeze so hard I smacked my head off a desk, busted my nose open and sprayed my workplace with blood**

Edit: Fucked up Mr. Pollock's first name."
"TIFU by finding gold flakes.


Tuesday night I helped a friend do some engine work.  When we got done, the car ran fine.  Wednesday morning his car died on the way to work.  Wednesday night, I noticed my wedding ring was missing.  I never take it off and rarely fiddle with it, so  i wasnt sure when I lost it.  *Queue sinking feeling*  Today I got a chance to look at the car engine.  When I opened up the intake manifold, the inside was covered with pretty gold glitter.  I'm sure my ring slipped off, got sealed up in the manifold and made its way down to destroy the valve seats and cylinder wall.  The engine is shot, and my ring is reduced to dust.  I did the right thing and bought the car for fair (running) value.  I'm thankful it was a high milage clunker.  At least I know what happened to my ring.

tldr:  don't wear rings when working on engine internals.

edit1:  Thank you for the gold, the kind words, and the advice!"
"TIFU by trying to replicate a local supernatural phenomenon and almost getting killed.


Where I live there is something called the Spooklight. Many towns ""have them"".  Basically people think it is a light that will show up on certain nights in the country outside of town. People have pinpointed its prime location to a road, known as ""spooklight road."" No joke, that is what everyone calls this road. The road comes to a dead end down by the river, and on this dead end lives an angry old man who doesn't believe in the spooklight. Thinking about it now he probably is just pissed off because so many people drive down there to look for the light every weekend. Anyway, me and my friend were at a party when we got the idea to go ""spooklighting"". (We hadn't been drinking) So we head to the dead end of the road, and park his truck. After about 30 minutes of waiting for the spooklight to appear we got an even better: we would get a flashlight out of his truck, run around in the woods, and pretend to be the spooklight and prank people. So after the around quarter mile walk back to his truck, we grabbed the flashlight and went in the woods behind this guy's house. We started running around, shining the flashlight towards the road to see if we could scare anyone. During all this fun, we hadn't realized that the guy was standing where his yard ends and the tree line begins, watching us. With a gun in his hands. He didn't begin with a warning yell or anything. He fired right at us. I know this will sound cliche, but where I'm from people don't fire warning shots. We have the make my day law, which states if someone is trespassing on your property, you are fully in the right to blow their head off if you want. I've always found it to be a little harsh, but the law is the law. Anyway, back to the first shot. I was frozen in fear, but my friend hit the deck really fast. This caused me to believe that he had been shot, so that really scared me. He immediately jumped up and took off sprinting, and I followed suit. This is by far the hardest I have ever ran, and I run track for my school. We hopped in his truck, and he sped so fast out of there. That is BY FAR the most scared I have ever been, and the closest I've been to death as well. Me and my friend vowed to never go back to that damn road. 

Tldr; me and my best friend decided to run around with a flashlight in the woods behind this known angry guy's house, and almost got killed (legally) because of it. "
"TIFU by eating my brothers tooth


Well I should probably explain. Every day I wake up half asleeep and get dressed, take my allergy pills, and eat breakfast before sitting around waiting for the bus. But I decided that I should stay up late watching bundles of youtube videos, so I was a zombie walking around the house. I only got half dressed before walking to the kitchen, and for some reason my brother had lost a tooth that morning, and decided to lay it next to the pills that had been set out. So without looking, and barely awake, I grabbed his tooth and a vitamin pill, and popped it into my mouth. I was fully awake as it was halfway down my throat, but there was no stopping it. My brother had been in the room watching in horror (he's 8) and ran to my dad crying. I ended up being fine, and I never checked my crap for that tooth, but I had to pay up tooth fairy money with my own cash. Well I was feeling pretty nice so I gave him 5 dollars and a bullshit story on how the tooth fairy took it out of me using magic, and that was that. I'm glad I never heard of it again, because my dad isn't the type to do that, and my brother was 8.

TL:DR I ate my 8 year old brothers tooth instead of an allergy pill, and paid him my own money.


Edit: thanks everyone for the upvotes, I wasn't expecting this much popularity!"
"TIFU by reporting myself for theft


Obligatory this happened several years ago.

I was out drinking with some uni mates on a bit of an informal reunion. We'd been out a fair while when we went to a bar that used to be a student favourite but had over time become a locals' pub popular with the residents of a nearby council housing estate. Most of the guys didn't really fit in, with their skinny jeans and fancy shirts. I've always been a scruffbag so I didn't stand out too much.

After one drink (my round by the way), everyone decided they wanted to get out of there and try another bar so we left quite quickly. About 10 metres out the door I realised I'd left my leather jacket behind. When I went back in to grab it, someone was picking it up off the seat it was on. I said ""Oi, that's mine"" and he apologised saying he thought it was his because it looked similar. I slipped it on and caught up with my mates.

At the next bar we didn't stay long enough to get back to my round. And we headed to a club. I Agreed to pay the lads way in instead of a round but when we got to the door I found I didn't have my wallet.

Obviously the guy going through my jacket in the Court Inn must have nicked it. This club was on the same road as the police station so I said to the lads that I was going to report it stolen and then I'd catch up with them in a bit. I went to the police station and there were about 4 policemen in the car park so I called one of them over and told him the tale. When they asked for a description of the guy I gave it.

Here's where I should have thought harder. He had hair about the same length and colour as me, beard about the same length as mine. He had eyes the same colour as me. He was about my height. He was wearing a t-shirt about the same colour as mine, Jeans like I was. And he'd said he had a leather jacket like mine so I told them he might be wearing a leather jacket. I told them all this, and that he was at the court, gave them my phone number and left.

Since the court inn wasn't far and would be close to kicking out time I thought it would be a good idea if I went back and confronted the guy. So as I was wandering back I wanted to text the guys to let them know what was going on. I couldn't find my phone. I was confused by this because I thought I remembered checking it in the queue for the club. Turns out the inside pocket of my leather jacket had a tear in the lining. As I'm almost at the pub I find my phone, my wallet and an old work ID in the lining of my jacket.

Relieved I turn around to head back to the club right as two police officers are stepping out of a car behind me. I walk towards them thinking I'll tell them I reported a crime and that I wanted to cancel the report. They came over and said they were investigating a theft and I suspect I wasn't very clear in my explanation because when I said something like ""no, I've got the wallet back"" they asked to see it. Saw it had my ID in it. Saw I matched the description of the thief and started arresting me. I don't think it helped that on my driving licence I had no beard and at this point I had quite a full beard.
 
When they got me back to the station they had my phone and rang it to try and get in touch with me. When it rang they thought I must have taken that as well. I tried to explain that I was me and I was mistaken when I said my wallet was stolen but I was nervous, drunk and rambling so they didn't really get it. But they did say if it was my phone, could I unlock it. I was shaking nervous and drunk and I got my pin wrong three times and that was that. They processed me and tossed me in a cell overnight.

In the morning, a sober me was easily able to explain that I was me and that this was all a big misunderstanding and in the clear light of day they could see that I matched my ID and I was let go with a warning about wasting police time and filing false police reports.

TL;DR Thought I'd had my wallet nicked. Gave the police a detailed description of myself for the thief. Realised I had my wallet and the police arrested me for having the stolen item and matching the description of the thief."
