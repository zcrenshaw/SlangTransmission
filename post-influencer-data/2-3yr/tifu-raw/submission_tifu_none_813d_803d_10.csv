"TIFU by voting to end net neutrality


Obligatory ""this didn't happen today"".  Well, actually I guess it's happening right now.

Today is the Internet Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, and /r/TIFU is participating.  We support a free and open Internet, so today we have restricted the submissions to this subreddit to give you a feel of what it might look like if net neutrality is ended.

Here are some links for further reading about net neutrality:

"TIFU by getting my dad an ancestry DNA test for Father's Day and destroying his self identity


I know most non-Americans on here think Americans are idiots for how much stock we put in our ancestry, but the fact is that here in the US where heritage is celebrated and held up with pride, it becomes a large part of our self-identity.

My father's entire life he's been told he's 1/4 Native American (Seneca, to be exact) and that his grandmother was full blooded.  His parents taught him to take pride in that fact and his whole life he did.  He attended powwows, he read and learned about native culture, etc.  He even got a dream catcher and buffalo tattoo for his midlife crisis.

He's always been pretty into genealogy and has traced his father's side of our family back hundreds of years.  So, for Father's Day this year, I thought it would be fun to get him a 23andme ancestry DNA test.

We got the results back this morning and he's 0% Native American.  He's 40% Irish, 25% German, 10% Scandinavian and a quarter ""broadly northern European"".  He took one glance at the results, shook his head, went to his bedroom and shut the door.  A half hour later he came out yelling about how he should've gotten a shamrock tattoo instead.  I think it's going to take awhile for him to come to terms with it.

tl:dr-- My dad was told his whole life he was 1/4 Native American and made it a big part of his identity.  He's not NA at all and so my Father's Day present made him lose a huge part of his sense of self."

"TIFU by hanging out alone with 5 drunk girls


So, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. 
I thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. It was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. Sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? 

Wrong. 

I was invited over to start up a fire pit because ""I can't do it myself"". 
So, I ask ""having a pool party, huh? Yea, I can do that!"" I get a reply ""yea, a party, sure!"" 

Red flag one. So, I take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the ""party"" is at. 

Red flag two, the fire pit is already a' blazin. 

I didn't think much of it, but I also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but I'm not complaining. I settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...

One of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. Funny thing was, she was the only girl I didn't see drink alcohol. 
And like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, BAM she was blitzed. Then, Another girl looked at me at one point and said ""come here, I gotta tell you a secret"" So, I swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. I'm thinking, ""okay not what I expected but I ain't mad."" 

As I go to kiss her back I hear, in an extremely angry tone, ""What the FUCK?!"" One of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.
She swims over to us, and I'm thinking that I'm about to be castrated, but my presence doesn't phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. 
They start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, UFC style. 

But, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. I'm thinking to myself ""what the fuck. Should I be aroused or terrified?!"" 

I assure you, I was both.

After that, shit got scary. They threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. Now, I grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so I know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! IN THE DEEP END OF A POOL WHILE DRUNK. That shit got me praying to every God in every religion. I wasn't sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, I was just trying to stay alive, man. Their ""playful"" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. I thought it was the last thing I'd ever hear. 

Then things kinda settled down, so I, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because I had too much to drink and I'm not trying to get a DUI or wreck my motorcycle. 
But I woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and I thought ""aw fuck. This is it. These ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. MY LUST, MY GREED, I DESERVE THIS."" So, I flip around to better see what's happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. I mean really going at it. Like a fire hose. 

Then, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of Blue Poles by Jackson Pollock, she looks at me and says ""sorry, didn't mean to wake you"" and walks away. Like it was nothing. Then, I just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until I was sober. And I got the fuck out of there.

TLDR; hanging with 5 girls in a pool sounds like a dream, but it's actually a nightmare and they will get naked and try to drown you."
"TIFU by promising my daughter she could keep a seagull


Obligatory ""not actually today,"" but July 2016. I was on a beach vacation with my wife, 9yr old and 7 yr old daughters. The kids had been pestering me about getting a pet. In my infinite fatherly wisdom, I promised the girls they could ""have a seagull"" if they could catch it. Because, come on, that just ain't gonna happen.

Later in the week, I am lounging in my beach chair when...I shit you not... my oldest daughter nabs a seagull in a butterfly net. After many seconds of cheering from both daughters and confused gray and white flapping, I managed to collect my jaw off the sand. I ordered my daughter to let the bird go.

Both daughters were quite pissed off because it had taken them days to formulate and successfully execute their plan to acquire a pet. The story does have a happy ending. I did promise the girls a pet so we adopted a puppers. I have learned to never promise anything to the kids I can't deliver no matter how far fetched it seems. I've also learned to *never* underestimate the abilities of two young girls who have their heart set on a goal.

TL;DR I promised my daughters they could keep a beach seagull as long as they could catch it bc I knew it would never happen. Except that it did happen. I half-kept my promise by exchanging the seagull for a puppy.

"TIFU by shooting a physically handicapped man with a paintball gun at point blank range


So, this story, as is the case with most, did not happen today but a few years ago.    
My first year in college was about 3 years ago. So at about the 2 and a half month point into my first year, my residence counselors decide it would be fun to go paintballing. So 2 of my friends and I sign up and the rest of the list is people I have not met or talked to yet.    
Fast forward a little bit and we are playing ""Deathmatch"" in paintball. Teams were just kind of thrown together and my side was most of the athletic males and females against the people just looking to make friends. Eventually, it is about 5 of us taking on 1 person. Me being the tactical genius I am, decide to flank around and catch him by surprise. So I sneak my way around while my teammates are distracting him and eventually got the little hold up he encased himself in. Now, when you're playing paintball/airsoft, it's courtesy to give someone a ""mercy"" rule when you're close enough to where shooting them could really hurt. So I started saying mercy while having my gun to his back about a foot away from him. No response. I say it again and louder this time. He's still shooting at my teammates so I say ""Final time. Mercy!"" and still no response. So, I unloaded about 3 shots into his back and he winces in pain and grabs his back and falls to the floor. Ref calls for everyone to come back to the player meeting area so I say ""sorry, dude. I called mercy."" As I'm walking towards the player's hub, I turn around to see him walking with somebody and I thought they were shaking hands as a good game thing. Then it dawns on me that they aren't exchanging pleasantries, they are communicating through sign language. I snuck up and yelled at a deaf person and then shot them 3 times in the back from about 3ft away for not listening. At this point, a huge wave of ""Douchebag"" just washed through my body and I felt sick to my stomach.   
I eventually went up to the man and the person he was with, asked her to tell him I was the one that shot him very close and then asked her to show me how to say ""Sorry for being a dick"" in sign language and then repeated it to him.     
TL;DR Ran up behind a deaf person in a paintball game, yelled at him, punished him for not listening, apologized in sign language.     
EDIT: Alright. Since this gained attention. I have gotten mainly two comments that I wanted to address.     
1. I play paintball once every 3-4 years so I have no idea what ""barrel tapping"" was at the time. I have taken that info for future games of paintball so thanks for that.     
2. I did not mean to offend for calling a person that was deaf, physically handicapped. I wanted to use the broad scientific term for it to avoid any possibility of offending somebody. I get there are some people out there who are deaf and find it offensive but if I used the term deaf, there could have been people that were offended I used that term. It's just a choice of whos going to get offended the most in this situation. "
"TIFU by losing a staring contest with my dog.


So this little fuck up did actually happen today. 

I have a big, yellow lab who lounges all over our house. He’s sort of like a giant twinkie who doesn’t really move and gets in the way at times, but can also be great to snuggle if you’re stressed. 

Now one of his various habits is to track you with his big, brown eyes from the moment you enter a room to the moment you depart it. (Or until something distracts him). 

So over the years I’ve developed a game where I’ll enter the room, snap my eyes on him and try to stare him down as I navigate the house to do whatever I need to do. For the record, he tends to win unless something else gets his attention, so the scoreboard is relatively even, I would say. 

On the day of this particular fuck up, I was walking through our kitchen and I happened to be testing out a new Nikon camera with a stabilizer. 

So, holding the stabilizer in one hand and balancing it with the other, I stalk the kitchen like a velociraptor with IBM, trying to get the perfect balance. (It’s friggin’ hard to get used too).

As I’m working away, I catch my dog staring at me. He’s not moving his head or anything…just following me with those big, brown eyes. Naturally I get sucked into his gaze, ready to beat the fluffy motherfucker in yet another stare down while I continue to stalk across the kitchen. 

Unfortunately, I forget an important detail in the layout of our kitchen. We have a couple overhead cabinets that extend slightly beyond the counter and you have to be kind of careful around them so you don’t whack your head. I, being a tall, lanky bastard, don’t usually have to worry about them as I come up to chest height with the bottom of them and can navigate them easily. 

However, as I was testing out the stabilizer, I adopted a crouch to get lower to the floor and stabilize myself. That in addition to my intense stare down with my lab afforded the perfect conditions for me to walk head on into the fucking corner of the cabinets. 

I slammed into them, hard, and jerked back instinctively. But due to my awkward position, I completely fucked up my center of gravity and sort of keeled sideways, slamming my chest into the edge of the counter, cracking the shiny, new Nikon lens in the process and dropped like a sack of potatoes. 

As I fell to the ground, the bottom of the stabilizer (which looks like [this] (https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Professional-S-40-plus-0-4M-Handheld-Stabilizer-for-Steadicam-Camera-Video-DV-DSLR/811114_1869449274.html)) sucker punches my balls in the most effective manner possible. All at once my vision dances, my breathing shallows, and my nuts explode in a tempest of agony as I slump on the ground, clutching a broken, fucking Nikon. 

It takes me a couple minutes to recover, but I do eventually. Of course Roofus McDoofus ambles over to ensure I’m alright, licking my face and generally rubbing in yet another victory. 

I ended up cracking the lens which put me out a couple hundred bucks, and plan to order another. Injury-wise, my forehead is throbbing but not cut, my chest is slightly bruised, my groin aflame, and my dignity in shreds. 

I think I’m gonna put a wide angle lens on next time and film my dog in a funny fucking hat. That’ll show the bastard who’s stare-master. 

TL;DR Got into a staring contest with my dog while testing out a new camera stabilizer, walked into the corner of a cabinet, went down hard doing damage to both myself and the camera, and ended up losing the contest. 

Edit: I'm okay, I've forgiven Roofus (real name Dyson after the vacuum cleaner) and am currently icing the more tender areas of my being while looking over the damages of both equipment and bodily harm.

Here's the pair of us: https://i.imgur.com/ZMbz8Ju.jpg with him giving me even more bodily grievance with a paw to the face in the second part. (He saw a squirrel)

Edit 3: In case anyone is curious, yes, this is the same dog featured in this tifu: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6gtkwa/tifu_when_i_almost_died_while_paddle_boarding/

Final Edit: Thanks to the GLORIOUS MOTHERFUCKER /u/GeekusMaxmius for gilding me. I'm gonna sick a certain giant, golden twinkie on you as thanks!"
"TIFU by thinking a dead person was a raccoon


Welp, I goofed once again. This time, I was relaxing in my room after church was over. I went on Snapchat to check up on what my friends were doing, and I came across a post that said ""RIP Spencer."" I was confused, but I continued on, and on another person's story I saw a [picture of Spencer](http://imgur.com/eIM0NMx) that said ""RIP Spencer, you going to be missed buddy.""

My dumb self thought that Spencer was the raccoon and not the person. I decided to tag along with the ""joke"" and posted on my story saying ""RIP Spencer"" and giving my condolences. People were messaging me asking if I knew him and stuff, to which I replied no. Except for one person.

This person asked if I knew the person, to which I replied ""It's the raccoon."" She said ""No it's not."" I was extremely confused, so I did research. [Here's the conversation btw](http://imgur.com/xJki3qX)

I was mortified when I came to realize that Spencer was not the raccoon, but indeed the human that was holding the raccoon. At this point, my messages were being flooded and I couldn't do anything but apologize.

So yeah, I apologized and sent a prayer and that was it. Hopefully this doesn't stick with me very long...

TL;DR
Everyone was saying RIP Spencer, I saw a picture of said ""Spencer"" which I assumed was a raccoon. Posted about it and now have to apologize to everyone that I offended. Spencer was actually a 16 year old kid that was shot in a fight.

EDIT: Holy bohunkus! This blew up extremely fast! Ok, Here are several links to some news articles for clarification: [Article 1](http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/article160379264.html) , [Article 2](http://wbtw.com/2017/07/09/shooting-in-aynor-leaves-16-year-old-dead/) , [Article 3](http://wpde.com/news/local/teenager-shot-and-killed-in-aynor)

I'd like to clear a few things up while I'm here. First, the picture was NOT passed out by the family. A friend had this photo of Spencer saved and used it. Second, people asked why I joined in a joke I didn't understand. In high school, it's kind of something you do, but I understand that doesn't really justify my actions. Third, I apologized to everyone not because I did something wrong to them, but didn't want to seem like a messed up person and I just had my mistake. Thanks for your comments and feedback! RIP Inbox"
