"TIFU by changing the fucking rules.


Good fucking day to you all.

A few days back we decided to change the fucking rules and generate a more ""wholesome"" fucking community by making our bitch-ass posts ""cleaner"" by disallowing vulgar slang. We even went as far as to change the fucking title to ""Today I Fudged Up"" As you could probably fucking tell by now, it was an April Fool's joke. Haha, we totally fucking got you motherfuckers.

&amp;nbsp;

Happy fucking April fools.

"TIFU by drinking an energy drink and almost dying.


This very recently. 

It was my day off, and I usually start my morning by drinking an energy drink and playing some video games. 

So I popped open a Monster drink and sat down to play. 

About 20 minutes later, I started feeling very anxious for no reason. Then all of a sudden, my chest started pounding really hard for no reason. 

I've had panic attacks before, but this was different, it felt like my heart was pounding, AT A RHYTHM IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO. This scared the crap out of me and I thought I might be having an attack or something. I tried breathing slowly, but it wouldn't stop. 

So I drove myself to the hospital. (I know that was really stupid, but understand that by this point I wasn't thinking straight, my brain was losing oxygen and I was in a delirious panic. )

Upon arriving at the ER, I checked in and they immediately rushed me back to a bed, and this is when it got really scary. 

I couldn't really understand what was happening, but I knew I was losing feeling in my limbs and my vision was going dark while nurses crowded around me, and they told me they needed to stop my heart. I cried out terrified, saying I didn't want to die.

I woke up a little while later with a tube in my arm in the same room. The doctor had explained to me that I had a severe super ventricular tachycardia, or in other words, my heart had been beating irregularly and in excess of 230bpm. At that fast of a rate, the blood doesn't have enough time to absorb oxygen, hence the delirium and loss of feeling. So they tried to chemically halt my heart, but that didn't work, so they had to use a cardioversion machine to stop and restart it. 

After talking to the doctor about my diet and personal habits, he summarized that I had been malnourished to the point of having very unbalanced electrolyte levels. 
Electrolytes are basically what allows your nervous system to control your motor function, and having poor electrolyte levels and introducing a strong stimulant made my heart go crazy. 

I haven't touched energy drinks since, and I try really hard to have a balanced diet now. 

tldr: poor diet and energy drink consumption made my heart go crazy, almost killing me. Electrolytes are important kids.

Edit: Holy shit, I was just trying to share a scary experience. I had no idea  this post would blow up so much! 
Umm, thanks I guess, I don't know what to say. 

I agree with those of you saying it wasn't strictly the energy drink that caused this, it was mostly my bad diet depriving me of potassium and phosphates specifically. But the energy drink is the match that lit the tinder I laid out. 

Some are telling me this event is rarely life threatening. 
That may be true, but I will say that some may be confusing what I wrote about with a super atrial tachycardia, which is far less serious than a ventricular tachycardia, which is serious enough that I am not allowed to donate blood or plasma due to me being permanently labeled a saftey risk. This isn't from my knowledge, this is from several doctors who told me so.


I appreciate the well wishes and the concern, I am eating a balanced diet, I exercise daily, and I only have the occasional coffee or tea now, I do not wish to repeat that stupid mistake. 

Edit again:

A lot of people have been asking what my diet was like before this happened.

It wasn't so much to do with what I was eating, but that I wasn't eating enough, I work very long hours and I usually only spared myself the time to have one good meal a day, usually something my wife cooked at home. The doctor said that because I wasn't eating frequently enough my body wasn't able to build up enough potassium and phosphorus to keep my system stable. The long periods of fasting coupled with long strenuous hours of working severely depleted my electrolytes. 

So the lesson is that you should not only eat a balanced diet, but also eat regularly. 

Edit x3: First time Reddit gold!! Thank you kind stranger! 
All I had to do was nearly kill myself from shitty habits.

"TIFU by expressing my dog's anal glands


I took my dog to see the vet recently. One of my concerns was that the dog was scooting his ass on our doormat. The good doctor educated me: dogs have two small sacs near their anus. These sacs are filled with stinky liquid that dogs use when marking places. As turds get passed, the glands get squeezed, pushing out some of this liquid and letting other dogs know that they've been there. Occasionally, these glands can get impacted, so it is good practice to clear them out every now and again. The dog will scoot his ass on the carpet to relieve the itch.

Now the good doctor showed me how to do it - WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING IT. That happened in the back, presumably done by the vet tech.

Fast forward to earlier in the week, when I noticed the dog scooting. So I got some nitrile gloves, and a paper towel and ""expressed the gland"". With just a gentle squeeze, the most vile liquid I could ever conceive of squirted onto my face and shirt. I cannot explain just how vile it was. Words do not do it justice.

Have you seen those beached whales who die and then their corpses explode from the trapped gases? I would rather eat what's left behind of the whale than smell this again.
I have showered several times and I still smell it. I have done nasal rinses twice and I still smell it. I threw away the shirt, but its in my garage. It can be smelled through 
the garbage bag in my garage.

TL;DR did some home vet tech work. Never again."

"TIFU be ignoring subtle scratching sounds from my would-be attic.


This was in the spring going into summer months. My cousin and I shared a two bedroom apartment on the second floor. This is a private four unit building, probably built in the early 90's or so. It wasn't fancy but it was nice for us. 

Occasionally we'd hear these little scratching sounds in the attic (which was inaccessible). Never really thinking too much of it, we never had an issue with pests of any kind. So we wrote it off as maybe a bird or a chipmunk. AGAIN it's not like we'd hear it all the time and only if it was quiet. 

It progressively got worse but now we knew where the sound was coming from, you could hear it coming from one spot in his bedroom, the corner. Again, being young and naive and not really caring- because it really wasn't a bother, we ignored it. Maybe once debating whether or not to tell the landlord. We didn't want to be THOSE people. After all it really was a very gentle sound, maybe it's the building because it's old I don't know. 

On a warm Tuesday morning we both get up and head off to work. He closes his bedroom door because I recently got a puppy and he didn't want him to wreak havoc in his room. 

So now it's about 330pm and we both arrive home surprisingly at about the same time, to look up at a window that is covered in wasps. Clearly on the inside. 

Holy- fuck. My dog. The dog was fine, he had his door shut, and us having carpet it was a perfect seal- no access out of the room for the angry mob of wasps. 

Turns out this nest was probably years in the making because it weighed enough to eventually come crashing through the Sheetrock while we were at work,  exploding on his bed and letting out thousands and I mean thousands of miniature raging serial killers. 

I am not kidding when I say thousands. You could hear the buzzing when we went into the apartment, from the foyer. Thank Jesus his heat duct was closed too for whatever reason, maybe luck who knows. 

Don't ignore sounds coming from your attic, albeit how small they are. Imagine if he was asleep and this happened in the middle of the night?!

TL;DR I fucked up by ignoring little sounds upstairs and it resulted in a mammoth size wasp nest to come crashing through the ceiling and exploding in a bedroom releasing thousands of wasps. 

Edit: we called our landlord and they sent exterminators over to bomb. It was a mess in the room. They also sealed the hole with new sheet rock. 

Edit 2: so the title is definitely supposed to say ""by"" not ""be"" the iPhone auto correct is disabling. 

Edit 3: I wrote this in comments but I feel like I have to say it. People are saying the tenant is at fault for not reporting such and such and they should be held liable. Do you know how quiet god damn WASP FOOTSTEPS are? Probably not because you've never been close enough. Sorry had to say it. should be liable. 

Edit 4: vacuuming sounded like sucking up confetti. Thick chunks of confetti of death. 

Edit 5: SO I DIDNT POST THIS BEFORE thinking it'd make this story way too long and blah blah. My mom (who is deathly allergic to bee stings) had lived in Texas for the past year and a half and moved back to upstate NY (guilderland) during this time. She popped over and decided to stay the night (my cousin and I arranged) I always think if maybe she was there - she left probably a couple hours before the crash. But would I be responsible for my moms death. I don't think I could live with myself. "

"TIFU by thinking 'never mix business with pleasure' didn't apply to me


We stay at these cabins in Oklahoma for vacation that we found on the internet while looking at getting married and figured it was worth the 3 hour drive to give it a try. It exceeded our expectations and fell in love with the place.

Our first visit was 6 days and the older couple that own the place were very pleasant and left us alone unless we needed something. By the end of our stay we ran out of propane and firewood (both specifically stated would be stocked free of charge) and we were shown where it was kept because it's easier if we do it ourselves. I thought that was weird seeing as how I'm paying for this to be done but went along with it anyway and enjoyed the rest of our stay. 

We book again to get away for the weekend and when we show up the owner comes over and shoots the breeze and says he's adding a third cabin and wants to know if I barter. This is where I should have grabbed my better half and ran into the cabin, locked the door and not come out until time to go home. I say yes( I own my own company by the way specializing in remodels doing tiling, flooring and plumbing) and regret it to this very second. All he needed was for me to run the sewer and water lines under the cabin in return for 7 free nights stay since he can't get underneath them very well anymore. I repeated...all you want me to do is the plumbing UNDER the cabin. Period. Nothing more? Answer was yes,  I need your young legs and specialized tools for the work needing done UNDER the cabin. My better half repeated...so all he has to do is the plumbing UNDER the cabin for our free nights and he promptly told her yes. His wife shows up and all of this is repeated again and to be sure I say...you only want the plumbing UNDER the cabin done and you'll do everything else because driving my work truck would be expensive if you want more than that done to which he says yes but like he's clearly getting frustrated with me repeating my question and I say good enough. We run out of propane halfway through our steaks, I try getting a hold of them to which there is no answer, steaks ruined and I should have taken that as a sign. I didn't. I wish I had. Did I tell you I didn't? Because I didn't. 

We come back so I can do the work and the world goes to poop. He has contractors there working so I can't get my plumbing stubbed through the floor so I run my trunk lines underneath figuring I'll be able to get in the cabin. Nope. They are there all day. I'm wondering why I'm there at all. This guy wouldn't waste my time on purpose would he? Now he is telling me where the shower walls are and the toilet and vanity and I'm like that doesn't pertain to me because I'm only doing the underneath stuff. He talks me into installing the shower faucet. Should've said no. We go back home work not done and tell him I'll waste another trip down to finish work. 

Said wasted trip was this last Saturday,  April 1st and I swear this isn't an April Fool's because I wish it was and this didn't happen. We leave at 3:30 am so that I can start working at 7. I'm cruising along and by noon I have my work done and girl him I'm wrapping things up and he hits me with our agreement was you set all the fixtures and put in the countertop and build a wall around the shower base and blah blah blah blah blah a lot more happened but I'm already boring the poop out of you so unnecessarily long story coming to and end is my better half finally lost her mind,  I politely lost my mind,  told them to keep the 7 free nights and that we would never be back. He doesn't care because he got his cabin plumbed for free. Well played old man,  well played. 

TL;DR Where I screwed up was not getting the job in writing before I started and the consequences of my actions led me to end up with nothing including our free week of stays. I learned that money, or the saving of it,  honestly trumps friendships. This experience taught me that displaying all your religious artwork and talking of God doesn't make you a Christian and that in my experiences I should trust you less. I learned that all of this makes me sad that the days of taking a man at his word and a handshake sealing a deal are gone. Oh well,  the joke's on me, right?"
"TIFU by ripping off chunks of lip with a -195C spoon


happened 2 hours ago, sitting on the bus back home with gauze strapped to my mouth

so. I'm a pastry chef and my restaurant has  this one dessert where I siphon nitrous oxide charged cream into liquid nitrogen and break the frozen chunks up into something akin to dippin dots. pretty tasty stuff, and I usually have a little taste to make sure it tastes good before I send it out.

order comes in, we're pretty packed so I rush to get my shit together - I toast my meringue, add my granita and vanilla ice cream and get my stuff out for the nitro cream.

now, nitrogen is pretty fuckin cold and dangerous to handle - e s p e c i a l l y in a cramped open concept kitchen, with customers sitting right in front of you. you kinda have to put on a show and remember your kilometre long order docket while protecting customers from being splashed by -196C (or -321F for the only place that still uses the imperial system) liquid

cut to when I'm breaking the cream up in the nitrogen. it freezes to a crunchy solid on contact, and the nitrogen is basically a ruthless liquid that freezes anything and everything. my spoon is pretty frozen at this point, and I leave it in the nitrogen with some cream bits still on it. bout 30 seconds later after the dessert is out, I'm talking to my guests when I put the spoon (THE FROZEN SUPER FROZEN FUCKING SPOON) in my mouth to taste the cream

cue the fuckupery! the spoon immediately freezes to the corners of my lips and gets stuck. panicking, I turn away from the guests and start tugging, feeling a world of pain as little chunks of flesh start ripping out. I then had a brilliant idea to try and warm the spoon with the heat of my whole mouth, clamping down with the entirety of my lips, ultimately freezing my entire mouth shut. blood starts dripping from the side of my mouth, and I turn to see guests just staring at me with their jaws on the floor (how nice to be able to separate your lips, huh?)

I pull harder and feel flesh tear and new wounds open. tears are coming to my eyes and I give up and run to the bathroom, washing my mouth and the spoon with hot water. the spoon comes loose but so does all the skin that came off with it. I'm now pouring blood and my tastebuds have been rendered useless for the rest of the night.

I find my head chef and kind of just mumbled a bloody something about a first aid kit - patched myself up, and couldn't speak or taste for the rest of the night while continuing normal service with a wad of gauze taped to my mouth

TL;DR : decided to put a -195C spoon in my mouth and froze it, yanked a little too hard, bled everywhere and lost the number one tool any chef is nothing without

Edit: the parts of my mouth that were bleeding are now stark white, and my lower lip is swollen and the inside that touched the spoon is white, my tongue is a little numb but I think I have 60% of my sense of taste back. the white bits feel like ulcers, but I didn't see a doc, I don't think I need to unless it gets worse
never gonna put cold spoons in my mouth again

Edit 2.0: here's how the dessert looks like https://instagram.com/p/BSIZ3_SAViF/"
"TIFU by kicking the sofa


So I woke up in the early freaking morning and was drowsy as all heck, and was walking towards the refrigerator. In my sleepy state, I just kept walking and missed the flipping sofa's leg. Being the silly spoon that I was, I accidentally kicked the leg and it hurt my goshdarn little toe. I was squealing in pain, ""FRICK! SHOOT!"" By golly it was painful. I don't know why I kept the fluffing sofa over there. I don't even know why I have to keep it there of all the fuchsia places around.


In my frustration I kicked the leg again, and this time it fizzing hurt even more. Hurt like a monkey-fighter. It ached like a darn Monday-to-Friday, and I was shivering while checking it to see if it's a tad too gory[.](https://bpaste.net/show/2668036a81b1) I had to sit down to comfort the toe and calm myself down, while uttering ""Gobsmacking son of a snitch.""

TL;DR: Injured my toe, oh god no

edit: Gee jiminy cheese and crackers, it's a mod favorite!"
"TIFU by adding orange oil to my bath and getting chemical burns everywhere


So this fuck up actually happened about an hour ago and I'm still feeling the consequences. 

Tonight after returning from the gym I decided that I deserved a nice facial and bath.  I made preparations for this evening event and thought a candle sounded nice.  You know, to set the mood and put out them good smelly smells. I got my orange scented candle and trotted off for my bath.  Now sometimes when I treat myself I put a few drops of lavender oil in the bath, but I also have some pure extracted orange oil.  I've never used this in the tub, only to put on my wrists and whatnot, but tonight seemed like a great time to break it out.  I put two cap fulls of it in the hot bubbly water (I'm guessing like a 1/2-1 tsp) and I hop on in to enjoy. A few minutes later my fuck up makes its presence fully known.

Well I'm browsing reddit and enjoying the bath, the back of my knee start burning.  It's mild at first and I figured it was a weird gym related cut reacting to the water.  I felt around and got nothing so like an idiot I ignored it.  Soon it's both of my knees and it feels on fire! I finally figured out it was the oil! I jump up, turn the shower on, and start trying to washing this crap off.  Alas, to no avail, the damage was done!  Eventually the burning spreads from my knees all the way to my butt, inner thighs, lower back, and shoulders.  Everything felt so hot and just on fire. To describe this sensation I'll let you imagine rubbing sandpaper on the worst sunburn you've ever had.  Sounds real nice, right? I was screaming and hysterical in the freezing shower burning my skin off while crying. 

The burning wasn't getting better and I kept seeing visions of my skin falling off.  Terrified and in horrible pain I gathered the strength to call my husband, who wasn't home at the time.  After screaming/sobbing the story as best I could he quickly came to his hot, naked, and wet wife's aid.  (Trust me it was the least attractive I've ever been I'm sure.) We googled orange oil chemical burns and found a few answers but I basically just had to take a half hour long ice cold shower until the burning stopped.  Everything is pretty much better now, the skin feels raw and bumpy but it only stings a little.  I'm just lucky it didn't get in more sensitive areas.  I know now this oil isn't for bath time, and should have been diluted with a carrier oil at least.  

Thanks for reading and joining in my pain.  Half way through I made a joke that at least I had a pretty good TIFU now. I figured it was time to pay for how much I laugh at you guys!

TL;DR added orange oil to my bath tonight, reacted to it and got chemical burns, then had to call husband to come home and help me, took a long cold shower to cool off my burns and it still hurts... I completely ruined my relaxing night! 

Update: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for everyone's concern and tips!  For those telling me I should have used olive oil, I actually did use that after my husband read that soap and water doesn't always work.  It seemed to help get the orange off pretty well. When I woke up this morning everything was completely fine, no trace of the event at all.  I'm glad it's over and I at least made you all laugh and I got some karma out of the deal too. Thanks! "
"TIFU by performing CPR on my Dad...


Back story: I live with my mom and go to university while staying at her house. My dad lives in Arizona and I decided to visit him while on Spring Break.

I was watching TV (local news) with my pap and he decided to take a small nap. Me, being the loser I am, decide to go and watch some YouTube in the other room. My dad typically snores loudly throughout​ the house and proceeded to do so as he fell asleep.

After about an hour of videos I decide to see if my pap was awake yet and wanted to play some Rocket League. Although, everything was silent except the TV playing some random law show. I was curious to see why he wasn't snoring, so I closed the door loudly to see if he woke up. No response. I called his name. No response. At this point I'm freaking out wondering if he's deaf in both ears (he's deaf in his right ear) or dead.

As the CPR certified person I am, I go and start the usual steps. Check response, breathing, and pulse. He didn't respond, wasn't breathing, but he had a slight pulse. So I jumped up ran to get my phone downstairs, but as I was running my sock slipped on the carpet stairs and I fell face first. I screamed in agony, but continued on, for my dad's life was on the line. I grabbed my phone and a shirt in my dirty hamper to stop the bleeding coming from my head.

I called 911, moved my dad, and started CPR. I pushed and his sternum cracked just like they tell you in CPR class. As soon as it broke he woke up and screamed at me asking what I was doing. I had never been more scared in my life. The person I was just trying to perform CPR on woke up and yelled at me for doing so.

Eventually, first responders came and I got stitched up above my eyebrow. They took my pap in for x-rays and he just needs to wear a brace for a couple weeks. I also broke a little bone where my eyebrow is. 

Turns out that nothing was wrong  I with my dad's heart or lungs because he just has a sleeping disorder that makes him unable to breathe at points in the night. He now has a respirator to wear just in case. In the end, my dad wasn't mad at me after what happened because he knew I was just trying to help and save his life.

TL;DR: My dad wasn't breathing so ran to call 911, slipped, and cracked my head open. I then performed CPR, broke his sternum, but he woke up and didn't actually need CPR. He just had a sleeping disorder.

Edit: A lot of you are telling me I should have pinched him. In my CPR class I was taught to shake the shoulder and ask if they can hear. So I was kind of freaking out and didn't think about pinching because I had never been taught to. Although I messed up big time by not doing a sternum rub.

Terrible photo​ quality, but [here](http://imgur.com/kce3uRt) is a picture of my eyebrow after falling.

Everything is doing better today, just a black eye and my dad's sore chest. Lots of meds though.

Edit 2: WOW! Had no clue being clumsy got you gold. Thanks, and thank you all who have wished my father good luck. I've enjoyed reading your own personal stories about events related to this."
"Tifu by riding a bike


This happened yesterday after 3:30. Me and my mate come out of school and thought it would be a great idea to swap bikes on the way home from school. Soon after we swap bikes and start riding home. About 3 minutes after riding I lost control of the bike and went face first into a brick wall. I watched as 2 of my teeth roll across the floor as Im realising what happened.We call an ambulance as im spitting blood into the pavement. The ambulances were busy but we waited and no ambulance arrived. 30 minutes later im taken to hospital by car and I have xrays taken and had my braces pulled out as the hooks dug into my mouth. then sent to the dentist and had my teeth put back in. I can only eat soft food for 2 weeks now and have no school. 

Tl;dr Rode friend's bike home, lose control of bike and lose my teeth, teeth then put back in and im on a soft diet."
