"TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV


This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

MORE EDITS: There are quite some people asking for an AMA. Im already hated by the internet for ""milking that karma cow"". If you care I can do an AMA, it's the choice of you guys and gals. For today I have enough internet and I guess by tomorrow nobody will care anyways.

OH and thanks for the gold! Things are going so fast here I didnt even see it until now. Thank you unknown and kind strangers!

"TIFU by cumming into a coconut


EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

EDIT 2: RIP inbox

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

EDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit's history. Lord save me."
"TIFU by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. [NSFW]


Brief summary:

I was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. I took some and expected the typical described results. What I did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. I was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

Ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. Confused, yet dedicated, I proceeded onward. The next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""How could this be happening?"", I thought, but I was far too invested at this point to give up. The next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as I considered the consequences of my actions.  

My little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. Also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. I'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.  

**AFTERMATH: WARNING NSFW(no blood)**

[Album of what once resembled a fairly normal penis.](http://imgur.com/a/msz2i)

I'm anticipating a few questions so I will address them here:

* Were you ever erect?
     * I achieved at most half-chub intermittently for less than 50% of the entire session.
* Did you finish? 
     * Yes
* Was it worth it?
     * Absolutely not
* Did you use any lube?
     * No
* Does it hurt?
     * Terribly
* Why did you do it?
     * Because apparently I have no self respect.

TL;DR: Got high and beat my dick like it owed me money for six consecutive hours - excruciating pain and shame ensued."
"TIFU by having a really high pain tolerance.


So bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. 

Day one: I am lactose Intolerant, and I had a stomach ache, no big deal I probably ate something I shouldn't have. No harm done.

Day 4: stomach ache is still there. I'm a medical professional, I realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. Wrote it off as having too much ice cream.

Day 6: I thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but I shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? This was like 4/10. 

Day 7:  I realized I had a lump near my anus, I thought huh that's not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, I've had a few before no biggie.

Day 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one I've ever had, 6/10 I'll pick up some cream and Advil long lasting relief capsules from Target should be able to push right through.


Day 11:  I start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (I work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. So I go work thinking okay I can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. 

Well I'm not having a vacation now, because I'll be in the hospital for a few days. Apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and I just figured it was a stomach ache. Turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. The doctor told me that if I didn't come to the hospital within the next couple of days I'd be dead. 

TlDR; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn't realize my appendix blew up until way too late. Ruined my vacation.

Sorry for format I'm on mobile, I'm also on Dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. Credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, I was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that I would have died on.


Update: so I had a few people question why I felt Pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? So I talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. The lump I was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.



UPDATE 2: apparently I have Crohn's disease :/ lots of pain at the moment. I'll update once everything is for sure."
"TIFU by scratching my dick and destroying my neighbours £20,000 summer house


A common theme in this sub, this didn't happen today but in fact yesterday!

First off I'll give you some context; I'm a fat, miserable sack of shit with a receding hair line.

I also live in the beautiful countryside of Scotland, in a village with around 100 people in total. The village is right by the coast so the views are pretty fucking good.

Now my house is in ""an area of historical interest"" which means that in order to get the simplest of work done ""change a fucking lightbulb"" I've got to get permission from my local council.

They agreed to let me cut down this ugly ass tree that blocked a good chunk of my view. On one condition, they provided the contractors that did the work. I agreed, happy to get the cunt out of my garden.

So come yesterday I was super excited for once to finally get rid of this tree, I'd put in for planning about 2 months beforehand so they took their damn time. 

It was a two man team with a chainsaw, fair enough. No tension or nothing to keep the tree straight. I left them too it.

About an hour later one of the blokes is at the door asking me to give him a hand, I agree, ""making myself useful"". 

They explained the situation and told me they needed someone to hold the top of the tree and stop it from falling into the neighbours beautiful summer house. I said sure. They'd already taken about 1/3 of the tree down. So I put on my gloves and they begin cutting down the tree, when suddenly my pubes start going on fire, so my retarded ass goes and scratches his dick for one second and you just see this 4 meter tree land right over the wall on their summer house. 

Needless to say contractors left kind of quickly and the neighbours are away on holiday. Halp.

TL;DR Miserable sack of shit stops holding a tree to tickle his pickle and it ends up destroying the neighbours summer house whilst they are away on holiday.


EDIT: I've been to see the council and they've said they're going to be in touch. I'm expecting a court case. 

EDIT: Council have had me in their lobby for hours, not sure what they're doing on my property or with the tree. Might be getting assassinated by MI5, will update soon.

EDIT: Apparently one of the labourers were severely disabled, and according to the council shouldn't have been working in the first place. That gives me some hope.

EDIT; Fuck me this blew up. I do appreciate gold. Need to clear up the ""summer house"" phrase I used which has confused the yanks. It's basically a glorified shed to chill out in the garden."
"TIFU by not listening to a TIFU about a TIFU about using a coconut as a fleshlight.


I hope this will be the last time this happens, so make sure you read this carefully to make the most out of your cocofleshlight.

I read the first Cocofleshlight story and thought that was pretty gross, but was a little intrigued.

Then I read the second story and thought that was devastating, but I was still intrigued.

So I found myself a coconut in the closet and made sure it was big enough for my schlong, and made sure it wasn't infested with something. 

*Now here's the mistake I made*

I left the coconut water in to enhance my experience, and also I was weirdly turned on by fucking with water involved.

Turns out, I'm allergic to coconut water, and my dick swelled up and block the hole.

I panicked and ripped my cock out, which cut it horribly.

So here's the lesson: DONT FUCK COCONUTS

TLDR: Didn't listen to two posts, fucked a coconut while allergic to coconut water, fucked up my dick real hard."

"TIFU by mistaking shampoo for body lotion


I'm the sort of ""fair skinned"" guy who gets a sunburn when I think about the sun. Last week I went out to walk the dog and water the garden. No more than 10 minutes was planned so I didn't put on sunblock. My mistake.

I burned my inner elbow. The part that folds together when you bend your arm. It does not get much sun and somehow, magically, burned.

I keep scent and fragrance free lotion around for that kind of problem. I'm also a bit dry-skinned so I tend to moisturize my entire body after a shower.

After two days the sunburn was starting to crisp over and crack where my elbow joint was. Leaving open, raw skin to give me pain.

Still, I doubled down on that lotion. Easy enough right? I'm using it every morning! 

By day three it's spreading. My face is dry and starting to peel. My forearms are drying out. My... pole and bearings are drying out - peeling - and the sack is cracking and hurting.

My wife starts to get concerned. I went from thinking ""sunburn + heat rash"" to eczema. I've had that before, but only when I lived in the desert and the air was incredibly dry. I get concerned, when the goods are sloughing off skin like a molting insect it's time to be concerned.

Still, I triple up on the lotion. Working it in *everywhere I'm peeling* to try to counteract the dryness. 

Today I wake up, no change. The broken skin is peeling generously; it's not really getting better.

I shower and decide to go see the doctor. My wife's hesitant to even touch me and, yeah, that's not going to do.

After my shower I reach toward the lotion bottle on the shelf while thinking of the doctor call I'm about to make. Suddenly something registers in my mind. The lotion bottle.

It's been turned backwards all week, so the safety label is what I see - but there is a smaller product logo and my brain tells me to look again. I look again.

""Head &amp; Shoulders"" (for oily hair).

Yup, I applied Head &amp; Shoulders to my sunburn. To my face. To my body. To my Johnson. In an effort to moisturize my skin I'm adding chemicals that want to dry it out...

tl;dr: I've been rubbing shampoo into my body and my testicles are peeling like a snake that's shedding it's skin. Odds of Sexy Time until this clears up: 0%

Edit: Well this took off just a little. Updated facts: 

1. Here's my inner elbow after a day without shampoo: http://i.imgur.com/fIFha6N.jpg

2. My balls didn't sun burn. I use lotion after showers. I thought it was a new bottle of lotion. Thus the spread to both heads, and my back today. 

3. Thanks for the gold - if only it didn't come from my wife and friend who are actively mocking me 0.o

Edit #2:

4. Why didn't I smell the signature scent of Head &amp; Shoulders? Because I have a very weak sense of smell. 

5. Far too many of us have jacked off with shampoo as kids. Pissing fire fixes that fast doesent it?

6. No pics of my dick unless my wife approves of your tits.  PM's welcome! /s"
"TIFU by forgetting there was a shell chambered in my shotgun


This happened a few years ago and it still makes me feel ashamed because I’m the first to tell anyone about the importance of gun safety and how to appropriately and respectfully handle a firearm. 

Any who, I went to the shooting range with my friends to let off some steam. At the time, I owned a few handguns but recently purchased a 12-gauge, pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip for a little over $200 (what a steal) and wanted to christen it. The rules at the range for shotguns is that you can only use slug rounds (a singular, heavy projectile) not birdshot (basically, a bunch of bb’s). So we get there, go into our own lanes, load up and fire away. 

Since I had the newest gun, all my friends who came wanted a go at it. I obliged, loaded the shotgun up, and people took turns blowing holes in the target 25 yards away. I remember putting the gun down on the table after my last friend had a go with it thinking it was empty. I switched it up and began having fun with my other firearms. 

Time passed and we start unloading and clearing everything and locking our firearms up. Traditionally, I always unload and to be sure, aim the gun down range and pull the trigger to clear it. After locking up my handguns, I grabbed my shotgun by the grip with one hand, tilted it downward to where the barrel is pointing at the ground, and pulled the trigger to clear it. BANG! To my surprise, there was a round chambered in the gun and it blew the table into flying splinters and made a huge crater in the floor. Everyone in the range jumped and the range officer came running over screaming his head off. 

To make a long story short, the owner revoked my membership and banned me from the range and I had to pay for the damages. No one was hurt, but the fact that I didn’t correctly handle my firearm was the worst fuck up of all.

**TL;DR: Went to the shooting range with my friends. Recently bought a shotgun and wanted to christen it. Forgot shotgun was chambered and blew up the table into smithereens and left a nice crater in the floor. Got banned from the range and had to pay the damages.**

"TIFU by inadvertently pepper spraying my family


Ok. So my fuck up actually happened yesterday evening.

I was makiing some hamburgers to go on the barbecue. When I'm making burgers it's quite the process. So here I am, all my ingredients are out, I'm making my burgers. In go the onions, in goes the hot peppers. 

Burgers go on the grill, so I start cleanup. The peppers I have are finely chopped peppers from my garden last year. When I'm putting them away I notice a piece of onion had fallen into the Tupperware with  my peppers and left a moist spot. 

Here's my fuck up. I decide to toss the dried pepper flakes in *microwave* for 30 seconds to dry, while I put other stuff away. I look back with 7 seconds left on the timer and the microwave is **full** of *thick* smoke, and my peppers were on fire!. I opened the microwave, released this pepper bomb into my kitchen. 

Within seconds I'm coughing uncontrollably and yelling at my fiancee to get the dogs out of the house. We couldn't go back in for over an hour and we both were coughing for about 15 minutes. It felt like I had sniffed peppers, and inhaled them. Like pepper burn... on your lungs..

Tl;Dr
Burning hot peppers create harmful fumes. Do not microwave."
"TIFU by spilling coffee on an autistic boy.


WANT TO HERE THE AUDIO CLIP THAT CAUSED ALL THIS CHAOS? [Wake Me Up Inside (Feat. Screaming Best Friend)](https://clyp.it/xhd5hkak)

So, let me get one thing straight first. Spilling the tiniest amount of not particularly hot coffee on this boy is only the tip of the iceberg, and nobody got hurt from this. Physically anyway, my self-worth is hurting. This was a good two years ago, I'm new to reddit, but my self-worth is still hurting thinking about it.

I had four hours of public transport ahead of me, but I was ready for this. I'd created a two hour music playlist, and the other two hours was committed to finishing a book that I never got time to read. I settled in for the first leg of the journey, and put my headphones in. I pressed play.

Things were great for the first few stops, but as time went on, the train began filling up, and the once empty seat around the table I had settled at, became a family picnic area and playground for three passengers who took the seats at the table I was at. It's worth mentioning at this point that I had a window seat. So basically I was stuck, when things went terribly wrong.

So, the young boy, his older teenage sister, who was using an i-pad, and his mother beside me, who was reading what seemed to be a recently bought book from a station's WHSmiths, settled down for the journey. And the young boy quietly played with his toys and sipped his ribena and ate his banana sandwich, all while I happily listened to music with my earphones in at half volume. Everything was fine.

Until that is, the track changed, and a mp3 began playing that I totally did not mean to put on my playlist. My best friends voice, screaming at the top of his possibly drunken lungs 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence began blaring in my unsuspecting ears.

Imagine a full grown man, literally screaming the lyrics, with no backing track, as loud as humanly possible, and I still think people would struggle to fully appreciate how devastating this was to my poor ear drums. It. Was. Loud.

And in my shock and pain, I wrenched the ear phones out of my poor ears as fast as I could, being that I could not get to the phone in my pocket fast enough to not cause possible deafness.

But in doing so, the ear phone swung right into the face of the mother passenger to my right, causing her to lurch forward, spilling some of her cup of coffee on to the table. And the coffee went on her brand new book, her scarf, her daughters ipad, her son's toys, sandwich, carton of juice, and his hand...

Now, this is where it's important to remember that the coffee was not hot, it did not burn the child and the child did not complain or show any shock to this having happened. He didn't even notice the splash of coffee until his mother started yelling.

And boy, did she yell. ""What have you done? There's coffee all over this table, it's on my boy! You've burned my boy!""

Immediately awkward and apologetic, I scrambled to my feet to help clear up, not remembering the luggage rack directly above my head. Down I went, hands on the table, knocking the cup completely over, as I hastily stammered apology after apology. I was a mess.

Well, she was screaming. People stood up in their seats to watch the carnage unfold at our once peaceful table. The teenage girl was crying about her i-pad, immediately stopping by the way, when she realised she'd just hit the side button and it had gone to sleep. The mother was screaming about the coffee on the table, the now spilt ribena that her son had dropped, the struggles of being a mother with an autistic son, the wet pages of her book and the bright red, incredibly embarrassed mess of a 20 year old semi-stood and stooped next to her, attempting to soak up a whole cup of coffee with a single used tissue.

And then... The boy began wailing. He started pushing everything off the table, and - it wasn't really crying with tears - it was just frustrated noise. I felt like an absolute monster.

Needless to say, I got the hell outa dodge. When the woman stepped into the aisle to reach up for her bag, getting out baby wipes and tissues, I stepped out clumsily, apologising continuously, and making for the train door to the next carriage.

With coffee down my front, a bump on my head and a lobster red face, I stepped into the next carriage, then made for the next, and the next, until I was at the other end of the train. And in the eerie silence that compared to the chaos I had just left, I sat and considered how I never seem to be able to have an uneventful train journey. Literally. Every. Time. Something goes wrong. And this time? I sort of spilled lukewarm coffee on an autistic boy.

TL;DR - I jumped, knocked a mother sitting next to me, coffee was spilled, lots of screaming, lots of apologies, probably a mountain out of a molehill."

"TIFU by going to the wrong college by 2,900 kilometres. [x-post: /r/india]


Like most TIFUs, this didn't happen today, but ~10 days ago.

US applications for colleges begin in late August. I’d decided to join an NIT(National Institute of Technology) in India until I got a response from the states. I got accepted to National Institute of Technology(NIT) - Andhra Pradesh, or so I thought.

My dad and a couple friends decided to make the journey memorable and go by road. All cool. We drove across Maharashtra, into Telangana and finally to Andhra. A 930 Kilometre journey, and given how Indian roads are, it took us 16 hours; though we did stop several times for bird spotting, and adoring the view of herds of deers galloping along the horizon.

Regardless, the road trip was riddled with mind blowing greenery of the South Indian country side as we drove toward our destination, Tadepalligudem; where the NIT campus is situated.

We finally report to the campus, and move towards the admissions counter. The attendant there straight away denies us citing that I was never granted an admission in NIT-AP.

Panicking, we report to the admissions coordinator, who explains:

On my allotment letter, it was stated that I had gotten accepted to “NIT-AP”(In that exact phrase). The problem here is, there’s an Andhra Pradesh and an Arunachal Pradesh. Both are referred to as “AP”. Basically, I travelled 930 kilometres to the wrong state.

No where in the allotment letter had they stated “Arunachal Pradesh”, and living in the state right next to Andhra Pradesh, all six of the people with me never even thought of it; we went all the way there, only to find out we’d come to the wrong state, 2,930 kilometres away.

But we had a fun road trip! So yay….. I guess?

TL;DR: My allotment letter stated I had been accepted at NIT AP; being from Maharashtra, I assumed it was Andhra Pradesh and did not even consider the fact that it could've been Arunachal. Basically, went 2,900 kms to the wrong NIT AP.
