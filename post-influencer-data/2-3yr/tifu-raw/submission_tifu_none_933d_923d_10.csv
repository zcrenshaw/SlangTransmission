"TIFU by creating a dick-shaped island and getting suspended.


When I was in 8th grade science class we had to draw and create our own land mass in order to demonstrate our understanding of wind patterns, low and high pressures, etc. I thought of the idea to make the island in the shape of a dick. Our group drew it out. Of course we were smart enough to make it resemble a dick but not entirely, we made sure to make it curvy on the sides, edges where the balls were, stuff like that... but it clearly was a dick. We added tornadoes near the balls to look like pubes, added futures like 'seamen lake' and 'crabs port'. We finished and wrote the amazing title, ""PENN ISLAND"", or Pennis Land. We wrote it in big, bold, letters at the top and turned it in. A couple days later our science teacher called my group up to his desk... uh oh... but, we we were not in trouble. Instead he said something along the lines of, ""I would like to put this out in the hall, this is really great work"". Amazed, we all in unison agreed. For months our Penn Island was out in the hall, everyone saw it, everyone laughed and giggled. But the teachers never noticed until one day a parent called the school saying her daughter had told her about Penn Island. Eventually he called our group up after class and told us about it. Then out of no where, he started crying... he apologized for letting us get into trouble, he explained how its his job to keep kids from getting in trouble. HE apologized to US. He said it was his fault. To this day I still feel bad for him, it was never his fault. He was a good guy. The funny part was when we played dumb with him and he had to explain to us why ""Seamen Port"" was inappropriate.

Oh yeah, I ended up getting suspended for a day (the vice principal said I was very clever (one of my proudest moments)). Only me though, since my asshole group members made a plan to blame it all on me... fuck them. 

TL;DR I drew an island in the shape of a dick for a project and it sat in the hall for months without anyone noticing, eventually a parent found out... leading to my suspension.

EDIT: No, I don't have a picture of it. But here is what it basically looked like. The shaded part was brown, and the rest of Penn Island was green. The original was on a 4ft x 4ft paper poster haha. (Yes, those mini islands at the top are exactly what you think)

"TIFU by pushing the harness on a roller coaster one notch too tight.


Okay yeah, so this was about 6 years ago now. I recently remembered this story after years of trying to suppress it, and realized it was probably worthy of /r/TIFU.

&amp;nbsp;

So a few years back I was going on a date with my girlfriend at the time, and it was pretty early on in our relationship. I had some half-price coupons to the local theme park (Valleyfair, holla back Minnesotans) and we decided to go together. 

So we get to the theme park and right at the entrance of the park is this wicked roller coaster called [Steel Venom,] (http://i.imgur.com/yBictS0.jpg) and we decide that'll be our first ride. So we wait in line and get on the ride, and start buckling in. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now here comes the fuck up - after I push down my harness, I had just a *little* bit too much room to wiggle around. I figure I might as well push it one more notch, better safe than sorry right?

&amp;nbsp;

As it turns out, I was very, very sorry for being safe. 

&amp;nbsp;

I push the harness down one more notch and the ride starts, and I'm enjoying the ride from the safety of my snug harness, secure in the knowledge that I won't slip out and die. I'm a huge roller coaster guy, and I'm enjoying myself, having a great time, screaming louder than I need to.

&amp;nbsp;

And then all of the sudden I realize I'm enjoying the ride a little bit TOO much.

&amp;nbsp;

The harness, which was snugly contouring my body, unfortunately had an iron clad hold on my junk and was vibrating in all the ~~right~~ wrong ways. 

&amp;nbsp;

I start to panic, and frantically try to adjust myself in any way to get my nether regions away from the roller coaster-turned-sex toy, but it was no use. I was trapped in the mechanical jaws of Steel Venom, trapped by my own proclivity towards safety, and wishing that I would've just let myself slip out of my harness instead.

&amp;nbsp;

So at this point the ride is almost over, and I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, I can hold out. This ride doesn't need to have a happy ending - through the power of sheer will, I may be able to resist. 

&amp;nbsp;

But Steel Venom, the flighty temptress, had other plans. Right at the end of the ride (any of you who have ridden (rode?) it before will know this) the ride stops on the tracks (when it's vertical) and shakes the passengers violently. It's normally a fun part of the ride - I think the point is to make it seem like the ride is breaking or something. However, this time around, it was my undoing. The roller coaster shook and, despite my best efforts, I got to know the roller coaster in the biblical sense.

&amp;nbsp;

So we get off on the ride and I tell my date I need to go to bathroom. I assess the damage and my shorts and underwear are what an insurance company would call a ""total loss.""

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I need to decide if I tell the truth to my date or make up some bullshit, and so, in my post-coitus addled brain, I call my dad and ask him for advice (I told my date to go on another ride without me). He tells me, ""Son, that's the funniest goddamn story I've ever heard, and I'm pretty sure she'll think so too."" *click*.

&amp;nbsp;

So I tell her the whole story, and she laughs and laughs (it's echoing in my head right now). I tell her that if we want to stay, I need to buy a new pair of bottoms from the gift shop, and that I'll wait here in the bathroom and she can pick some out, and I tell her to go nuts. 

&amp;nbsp;

So she comes back with these sweatpants with ""WILD THING"" in pink glitter printed on the butt (""Wild Thing"" is another roller coaster at the theme park), I change, and the rest of the day wasn't nearly as ""eventful.""

TL;DR - Went on a roller coaster, pushed the harness too tight and it vibrated my junk on the roller coaster, ending as you would expect. Wore some glamorous as hell sweatpants for the rest of the day."
"TIFU by forgetting I'm not in Finland.


So, as usually, this fuck up didn't happen today, it was yesterday. I'm an film school student, working as an intern in Slovakia. Yesterday I was supposed to be at the studio at 5pm so as usually, I took a bus to the centre at 4.20pm and went for a lunch before hitting it up to the studio.

There is this fancy eat-all-you-can type of buffet restaurant in a shopping center. It's my restaurant of chose, when it comes to filling your stomach quickly. So, I finish eating, check the clock and realize I'm almost late from work.

From here starts the chain of unfortunate events. Yesterday was a laundry day. Instead of having a nice clean suit on me, I was rocking cargo pants, hoodie and a cap. I also had a pair of sunglasses on me and as I was in hurry, I put them on. I raise from the table, ""shout"" thanks to the restaurant, put on my earplugs and tune in some lovely Finnish death metal on max volume.

From there I start to walk fast and later on it transforms into full-on running trough the shopping centre. I was only a couple of meters away from the exit when a large mall guard craps me from my shoulder and then proceeds to drag me from my hoodie.

At this point I was really confused and quite upset about the fact that a large man is destroying my clothes. I go full aikido on him and on the process of destroying his hand it clicks on me. I HADN'T PAID FOR THE DINNER! Now, I don't know how it is in your country, but in Finland you have to pay for your buffet before you get to eat anything.

So there I am. Terrified in the middle of a fully crowded shopping centre, suspect of a shoplift and assault on a guard. I raise my hands up in the air and go something along the line ""Sir, I am so sorry, I was in hurry and I completely forgot to pay"". Now of course, this guy didn't understand a single word from the sentence and back we went to the restaurant ( this time he was only dragging me from my hand, rather than my hoodie ). The guard had a discussion with the restaurant owner in Slovakian language and then the owner just simply shakes his head. I tried to explain myself but nobody spoke any english.

The guard escorts me to a side room with a chair and a table and leaves me there. At this point I'm starting to grow a bit tired of the whole situation and laugh to myself because this kind of stuff only happens in the movies. I start to text my friends about the situation and run out of battery in a couple of minutes. Gladly there was a clock on the wall and I could tell the time. At around 17.35 a pair of police officers come to the room and GLADLY one of them speaks fluent english.

Indeed I was suspected from a shoplift and I was to pay for the charges. I explained how I've been in this restaurant many times and I've paid for my lunch each and every time with no problem. At this point the officer looks at me like I'm an idiot and asks me not to lie to him. The guard had told them that none of the staff had recognized me and that's the reason why I am in custody. I explained to them how on all the previous visits I had probably been wearing a suit. I also told them how I was in hurry and had to run to be able to make it in time and the fact that in Finland we have to pay first. Then the cops ask why I didn't respond to the guard tailing me and shouting to me. I felt like an idiot and that I will never get away with this, but I answered with the truth. I had my earplugs blasting music on full volume so I didn't hear anything.

The cops finally accept the fact that it was all a big mistake. We go to the restaurant and the cops ask the owner if he recognizes me with a suit and then apparently he remembers me and says ""sorry, sorry"" and something in Slovakia. The police translates it to me, saying that the owner was sorry for the whole thing ( wasted time and the guard dragging me from my hoodie ) and said that I didn't have to pay for the lunch. I refused the offer, paid and left the shopping centre, calmly walking, without the earplugs or sunglasses.

I arrived to the studio an hour late and everyone was relieved to see me. They had tried calling me countless of times and they were afraid that I had been kidnapped or something, because during the 4 weeks I've been in here, I've never been late before. They had even called the police on me...

EDIT: People seem to be quite worried about my ears and the fact that I might not be aware of the permanent damage it causes to blast music on too loud. I stated that I had my earplugs on ""full volume"" which nessesarely is not the truth. Just loud enough that I didn't notice someone calling for me in a foreign language! Thanks for your consern! &lt;3

EDIT 2: As for the band I was listening to, most likely Mors Principium Est. Check them out, they're amazing!

TL;DR an exchange student, forgot to pay for my dinner and accidentally acted as suspicious as one could, sat trough a police interrogation and caused global panic amongst my co-workers.

"TIFU by knocking myself out with a piece of pizza


This happened maybe 10 minutes ago and I'm still in the shock of this situation also my engrish is bad so bear with me. This might be the stupidest fuck up  I could ever imagine and I mean it. Here's how it all went down.

I came back from school, was a bit hungry so I popped one of those frozen pizzas in the oven. Not the healthiest option I know. Anyways we all know how dry these things can get, especially if you leave them in the oven a bit longer then you should. And that's what I did. 

But me being the glutton here, I wouldn't let that pizza go to waste and decided to eat it. So I sat down at the table with my pizza, reading something on my phone, went for the second bite. It was the crust of this already dry pizza and I took a really really big bite and swallowed it almost whole because I couldn't chew it properly. Now, I'm guessing you could imagine the feeling of this huge chunk of crust piercing through my esophagus in the most painful way. I could feel that fucker going down in the slowest way possible. I was all ""oh shiiiit"" in my brain and did what most sane people wold do and took a huge gulp from my soda. And guess what?? That fucking gulp also joined the bite and at that point I realized my vision was going black. All I could think was ""oh FUUU-""

Next thing I felt is hard cold kitchen ground underneath me. My cheek was pressed against and my head hurt like a motherfucker. I've never fainted before so I couldn't grasp the situation for a while. I saw my phone smashed into the pizza when I got up so I'm guessing I got blacked out, fell down and hit my head.

TL;DR the bite I took was so huge that it blocked my aorta or some shit and made me pass out.

Edit: Guys, thanks for all of your concerns and advice, I appreciate it. I'm all good now, only a tiny bump on my forehead. Most of you assumed I was a dude which is understandable I too tend to believe any internet stranger to be a male. And some of you said that my English isn't bad, thank you! You just can't be sure sure when it's not your native language, you know. 

Also that few people who tried to explain what an aorta is... really?"
"TIFU by losing my shit (literally)


Obligatory throwaway for obvious reasons

And obligatory this happened last night, not today

So last night was friday night. Finished work, decided to have a few beers. Whilst having these beers, decide im bored. Download some old school pokemon on my phone (emulator/rom). Having a grand old time playing.

Then i need to drop a number 2. 

Now lately my number 2's have been really sticky for some reason. 

And i should mention i get quite forgetful when ive been drinking.

So im on the toilet pushing one out, playing some pokemon. Decide ive been on long enough when i get up. This is where sticky poos come in. 

Just after ive stood up i realise ive got half a turd hanging out. I start to put my hand around back to catch it when i realise i dont want a handful of shit. So i pull my hand away. The jolting action makes the log slip away and hit the floor. I yell 'fuck'. The misses wakes and i can hear her getting up. She doesnt like me drinking too much so im desperate not to let her see a turd lying on the bathroom tiles. I move quickly to lock the door and step in the turd. I freak out and jump.

I ended up falling in the bath tub but didnt get to lock the door.

Missus comes in to me lying in the tup, shit on my foot and smeared on the floor.

Shes not happy.

TL;DR forgot i was on the toilet, dropped turd on the floor, slipped in it

Edit: after reading your comments i just wanted to clarify a few things.

First im not a stander. I literally forgot it was hanging there. I thought id already wiped and was good for liftoff.

Im not a mad alcoholic. I drink maybe 2-3 times a month. The missus doesnt like because something always happens (nowhere near as bad as this usually), not because im slammin' cans everyday.

And she took this incredibly well. After the initial shock, she chucked me in the shower and cleaned up. She was an absolute darl.

And for those of you wondering how i even have a missus...i dont have a fucking clue but if you're single, theres hope for you

Edit edit: ive been at work all day so havent had much chance to reddit but since ive been home ive enjoyed, for the most part, reading your comments.

I showed the missus this thread, and whilst initially horrified i would share this story on the internet, she found your thoughts hilarious and appreciated the support for her. If i could reddit correctly for a moment, in this story 'she the real mvp'.

In saying that i would like to touch on the comments about me being an alcoholic. I enjoy a drink every second weekend or so on average and this incident happened after about 7 beers. The reason she doesnt like me drinking is because ill either come pester her because i want a cuddle and want to talk, or because ill wake her up making a late night snack. 

And whilst i did get a bit drunk and slip on poo and embarrass the shit out of myself, remember thats all i did. I didnt drive while i was pissed, i didnt hurt anyone, i simply fell on my poo.

For all of you who enjoy an occasional drink but are clearly a lightweight, cheers to you!"

"TIFU by dropping my phone in a deep fryer.


This happened yesterday, and i am still feeling the pain now.

So I was working my usual Monday shift at the fast food place I work at, dropping food in the fryers, same old same old. Mondays tend to be slower then most days, so I was just on my phone while talking to a coworker. Well I (had) a Galaxy S7 Edge with no case, and those things can be pretty slippery. So dumbly, I was look at instagram while by the fryers, and saw a funny meme. When I went to show my coworker, my phone slipped out of my hand and fell in the fryers. Now I kinda expected what was to come, so we both ran, as hot oil proceeded to blow everywhere. It still hit me and my coworker, me worse (of course), as I now have several burns all over my body. Even worse, i'm out of a $700 phone &amp; got written up by my GM for being on my phone and ruining the oil. Oh yeah, the mess wasn't fun to clean either.

TL:DR - phone in fryer = boom"
"TIFU by starting a epidemic of shittily charged iPhones


This fuck up happened over the course of a few weeks, but I've only now grappled with what I may have done.

So I have a fairly new Iphone 6s. It was, for wonderful reasons I'm sure, left outside on what we'll call a dewy morning a few weeks ago. No major problems ever occurred, except the minor nussiance with charging. It wouldn't charge if it wasnt in just the right position; wiggling the cord could make it stop/start charging. At first thought, I was happy that my phone didnt seem to have any cosmetic damage from being apparently exposed to morning dew for so long. But eventually the poor charging ability after the incident began to become the worst sort of damage; a phone that you have trouble charging is a defective phone. 

For a week or so my phone was always on low battery. Sometimes I would manage to charge it well at night, and it would last a while. Sometimes the cord would move, and it wouldnt charge at night. Understandably, I used several peoples iphone chargers multiple times for about a week.

As this week comes to an end, I've gone through a few new chargers trying to find one that works without much fuss. I notice pretty quickly that all of my chargers, even the new ones I just bought in an attempt to fix the problem, now have the same black mark on the same pin on the connector. Great, it seems that my phone is actually ruining the new chargers I'm buying. In a predictable way. 

And when I realized this earlier today, I thought back. I have used many peoples chargers in the last week; one from a girl at work, another three from three different friends in two different apartments. Have I ruined all of their chargers as well? 

As it happens I was heading to one of those friends apartment shortly after that. Two of my friends have an apartment together, and I've used both of their chargers multiple times over the past week. When one of them goes to plug their phone in, he immediately starts to complain about how his phone doesnt charge very well anymore, he has to move the cord around to get it to charge right. I take a look at the charger, and I see the same black mark, on the same pin, on his charger. 

Now, I immediately realized the full gravity of what I had done. My phone getting a little too wet had apparently burnt out some small pin in the charging port of the iphone itself. That in turn ruined any chargers it was connected to for too long. Those chargers then in turned ruined the charging port on any iphones connected to them in the same way that my phones charging port was broken. 

Now, I feel bad that I may have ruined my friends phones, at least somewhat, but I fear for the greater ramifications of this fuck up. Because see, now my friends phone will ruin chargers of their own. Which will in turn ruin phones of their own, so that they can go ruin more chargers. I fear that before we know it, the entire regional stock of iphones and iphone chargers will collapse in the face of this enormous plague of bad charging. 

**TL;DR: My phone got wet, didnt charge well, and started ruining chargers. Any phone connected to *those* (now ruined) chargers eventually started to stop charging.... ruining more chargers in the same way. In about 6 months the only chargers left will be in madagascar**

EDIT: So in anticipation of all of my friends reading this soon, and probably reading through my entire post history, I'm gonna come back under a different account."
"TIFU by forgetting about a pot of rice on the stove, in a blizzard.


So a couple of days ago, the northeast USA got hit with winter storm Stella. Where I live got hit with about 2 feet of snow, but thanks to an abundance of wind, there are piles of accumulation anywhere from a few inches, to 3-4 feet due to the snow blowing around. More on that later.

I'm a college student, and I live with my boyfriend and 3 other housemates in our apartment. We all got a day off because of the snow, so naturally, we were smoking bowls and watching Netflix. As the munchies kick in, I remember that I have some left over curry from a local (delicious) Indian restaurant down the street, and decide to heat it up. And of course, you can't have curry without rice. So, I throw the curry in the microwave, put some rice and water on the stove on low, and decide to retreat back to the warmth of my room; my roommates don't like us to keep much heat on in the house, and my toes are cold.

A considerable amount of time later, we're watching a rather *steamy* part of the movie, and the music in the background is horribly arranged; or at least thats what I thought. This monotonous beeping keeps interrupting the beat......wait. Wasn't I cooking rice?

My high ass *forgot* about the rice, and I come out to an apartment **filled** with smoke, and two smoke alarms going off. I tell my roommates we should get out, as my boyfriend tries to get the rice out of the apartment (which was burning, but not on fire). My heart is racing and I'm in a state of panic, not helped much by the weed-- I run over to the door to open it and get some fresh air, when I see that none of us has shoveled the deck yet, and we're stuck behind about 3 feet of snow- most of which has blown over from our roof. 

Now starts the real panic.

Theres a wooden katana by our door that I stick through the small crack of an opening that I can manage with the screen door, and I start going crazy with it to try and loosen some snow. My boyfriend takes this over as I go to try and calm down/fan the fire alarm, that is now screaming ""EVACUATE"" at me. I go over to him a few minutes later, he mumbles something that I took as ""yeah, I'm getting there, blah blah blah try and squeeze through the door."" Theres a ~4 inch opening, and my adrenaline soaked body decides that we can fit through there. I squeeze through, bending the door, hyper-speed shoveling an area so he can open the door and my housemates can come outside. After a long while of shoveling in soggy pajama pants and a t-shirt, we were all safe and breathing fresh air.

After the place had been aired out thanks to the windows and some fans, we went back inside to get warm and hangout. What I failed to realize was that I was the only one freaking out, the whole time; as I'm trying to calm myself down (its been about 45 minutes and my heart is still beating out of my chest and my knees are still shaking), I start to feel something warm and wet on my shirt, along with a steadily increasing amount of pain. I lift up my shirt and find one normal breast, and one covered in blood from the nipple down. The shirt I was wearing was black, so I hadn't noticed the blood; after taking awhile to try and think of where the hell this came from, I remembered that I slipped through an opening between metal door and a wall that was about 4 inches too small for my body to comfortably slide by. Thanks to the crazy adrenaline/panic attack, I hadn't felt this at all. My pointy nipple ring (that catches on EVERYTHING) had gotten caught on the door, and almost nearly *ripped completely out of my nipple.*

Yeah.

So now my house smells like nauseating smoke, I ruined one of my favorite pots, and I ripped my favorite nipple in half. I might need to work on handling stress better.

I've since taken out that nipple ring, and will be sporting a bandaid on that nipple until it heals. RIP right nipple.

Moral(s) of the story; 
1. ALWAYS stay in the kitchen while you're cooking something! or, set a timer and stay close. Don't do what I did.
2. It's fun to be snowed in, but don't let yourself *literally* be snowed in. Keep up with the snow, shovel it (reasonably) as its accumulating so you're ready in an emergency, and to make it easy on your back. You *never* know whats going to happen.

**TLDR;** gets high, makes rice, forgets about rice. Smoke alarms go off in abundance, tries to leave apartment, snowed in behind 3 feet of snow. Gets wild kick of adrenaline, has panic attack, tries to squeeze out of much too small an opening of the door to shovel to safety. Comes down from panic attack/adrenaline, realizes nipple ring got caught on the door, now has a nipple ripped in half.

"TIFU by putting lotion on my feet when I was running late for work.


So as usual I woke up later than intended this morning and had to rush through my usual routine. Was scrambling around throwing everything and anything in my bag and remembered I had been wanting to take some lotion to put on my desk. So I decided todays the day and go grab the bottle of lotion from my room. Well of course the pump is open due to it being house lotion, so I have to take one for the cause and push it all the way down so I can close it for transport. Jump to 15 seconds later and I have a palm full of lotion and not enough skin exposed to deposit it onto. This is where I should have just washed it off in the sink, thrown the lotion in my bag and bolted. But my natural instincts would not let me waste 12 cents worth of lotion so I proceeded to slather, in the truest sense, my hands with about 3x more lotion than they could absorb. But I'm a smart problem solver, so I decide the reasonable thing to do is the distribute the lotion between my hands and the only other exposed part of my body..my feet. Fast forward and I am downtown, walking fast enough to cause heavy breathing trying to 1. Make the crosswalk light before it stops and 2. Get to work less than 10 minutes late. I was rounding the home stretch as I took my final ill-fated step and my right foot went rocketing backward, leaving my shoe and my momentum completely unchanged. In keeping with the laws of physics I proceeded to eat shit. Fast forward 5 more minutes (now)...sitting at my desk, fielding questions of why my face is scraped when I open my bag and realize the fucking lotion is still on the counter in my house.

TL;DR I put lotion on my feet, ate shit in the road. Edit: Forgot the lotion. Thanks /u/beebeelion 

Edit edit: Well this took off...Im proud to know that this incident is shared not only with the lucky commuters of downtown Dallas but also with all of you fine folk! "
"TIFU by making my own sex toy


NSFW - I was doing an article on DIY sex toys when I saw this video in sexplanations where she used an inflated latex surgical gloves to create a sex toy (fleshlight-ish). I was alone, I had a box of surgical gloves so I thought why the hell not. 


After two failed attempts ( one was just shaped weird and the other one had a slow leak 'cause I accidentally cut with the hobby knife I used -this is a very important detail) I finally had a sex toy. I whipped out some KY and went to town. Afterwards I was just sitting there, with an inflated rubber glove that was dripping fluids which I needed to get rid of. 


Remember that slow leak I said earlier? Yeah, I think part of my brain was still shut down when I figured I should just pop it with the x-acto blade and it should slowly deflate... 


That slowly deflating part, only works when the gloves aren't inflated to their limits. As I unfortunately learned. I slowly rubbed the tip of the blade on the surface of the glove/sex toy trying to create a small leak. It popped. The inflated glove/sex toy, popped sending jizz shrapnel everywhere. It was on my keyboard. My bed. My shirt. My shorts. My hair. Some on my face. Hours later I still finding spots that I missed. 


TL;DR - Made a sex toy out of an inflated glove, popped it with a knife, jizz everywhere."
"TIFU by failing at rocketry and lighting myself on fire, and then almost freezing to death


Obligatory didn't happen today, was several weeks ago.

Some backstory, a couple friends and I have a side hobby of rocketry, building model rockets and launching them out in the middle of nowhere at a one of our houses. They're homemade with sugar and KNO3, a good/safe project to work on in your free time. These are 100% legal (the high school I went to here even makes these as chemistry curriculum) and we always follow all the airspace guidelines and safety measures. 

The other day, we'd built one about three feet long with a good engine, and we were really optimistic about getting almost as far as we could push the legal airspace limit in our area. Went to light the fuse...nothing. It was about 0° and well below zero with big gusts of wind, and the lighter just wasn't having it. I soaked the fuse in lighter fluid, and still nothing.  The entire bottle of lighter fluid cracked too and spilled out, so we ended up using what was for the rocket fuse and engine to get it to light. Still nothing. 

I ran inside and grabbed a newspaper and a plastic box, lit the paper up and hauled ass back to our launch pad with a box of fire that would light the rocket in place of the lighter. At this point, we were all freezing to death and needed to get the launch done quick, so I lit up the fuse and sure enough, it went up in flames. Unfortunately, the high winds snapped part of the pad and a flaming rocket fell onto the ground, not moving but just burning fiercely. There was absolutely no risk of fire, as we launch after a rain/snowstorm and take the necessary precautions. Normally once the fire dies down within half a minute or so it can just be stomped out completely. We weren't too happy with the result of the whole mess so we cleaned up the debris and I went to stomp out the fire.

It is at this point that the fuckup began. You see, I forgot that the fuel was still burning a little. Normally this would be fine, but do you remember earlier when the lighter fluid bottle cracked open? Little did I know, the fluid had soaked into my jeans and I never noticed because I was already freezing. I stomped on the fuel, noticed that it was still burning, and then immediately noticed that my pants were ablaze. 

At this point I stomped again to get the fire off of my ankles, and it didn't work. Within a second or two it was almost to my balls, and I had no plans to deal with that. Cue me scrambling to remove my pants, on fire, in freezing weather. I made a mad dash for the water, and ending up rolling around on the ground while dousing myself in ice water. 

As soon as the fire went out, it hit me that the water was downright frigid. I put Usain Bolt to shame in the sprint to the house. I'm told that watching a singed, half-naked man in boxers soaked in ice water sprinting across a field in the middle of bumfuck nowhere was the highlight of my friend's lives. 

Tl;dr: Failed at extinguishing fire from a model rocket, lit self on fire, almost burnt balls, put out fire with buckets of ice water only to almost freeze balls in 0° weather. 

EDIT: Glad to see some other rocketry enthusiasts in the comments, even happier to see that safety is a priority. Anyone just getting into rocketry or wanting to should take away two things: rocketry can be really fun, but you gotta do it with the right safety procedures. There's almost always a rocketry club or organization nearby that'll happily guide you. 

EDIT II: For those asking about getting into hobby rocketry, look at joining a local club or organization such as NAR or Tripoli Rocket Association (TRA), check nearby for hobby shops that carry rocketry gear. Start small with an inexpensive rocket kit and motor to get a feel first, and then if you enjoy that move on to projects with an organization or some larger rocket kits. I would advise avoiding the ""sugar rocket"" model as it is risky if you don't know what you're doing (and still risky even if you do), and less reliable than commercial rocketry motors.

Make sure you're safe too, and take a look at your local airspace laws to see how high you can legally send a rocket into the sky. Also, launch in areas where you won't risk hitting other people's property or causing a fire, and please make sure to clean up *any and all* debris or garbage that might remain. 

Stay safe, and have fun!"
"TIFU by stabbing myself in the ass (with a fork)


Hi! Longtime lurker on here--this is actually my first real post so please be kind. I am 16/F, it was my first time in an ambulance, and I'm ok now!!

Anyways, it had been a seemingly uneventful day (especially since it was a snowday). My sister and I have been obsessed with the Great British Baking Show lately, so we passed the storm by attempting to make a swiss roll. After a family dinner, we were cleaning up and putting dishes away in the open dishwasher. I wanted to present the cake and put a little powdered sugar on top to jazz it up (a decision that would come back to ~~bite~~ stab me in the ass). This prompted me to get the sifter, which is conveniently located directly to the right of the OPEN dishwasher. Within this dishwasher and closest to the sifter-containing cabinet was the separate compartment for dirty cutlery, all standing to attention. So, in my motion to bend down to retrieve the tool, my unsuspecting butt felt 4 identical pricks as the tines of the offending dinner fork poked through my pants and sank about 1/4 inch into my lower left cheek. 

At first, I was more in shock than anything, and was probably a pretty comical sight as I jumped up with the fork still attached to my rear. Initially, it hurt, but it was bearable. My mom freaked out and I literally had to calm *her* down. I asked her to pull it out, which is when I realized (painfully) that it was in pretty deep. Soon enough, the rest of my family saw that the situation was kinda serious--albeit hilarious-- and they jumped into action. My mom called my neighbor, a chiropractor, and my sister called 911. My *dad* however, tried to dominate the situation. He did this by incessantly demanding we by trust his boyscout knowledge of puncture wounds, and just yank it out and apply pressure. However, my sister already had a professional on the phone so my dad's aggressive input was unnecessary and quite unhelpful to the already tense environment. In fact, it literally caused the dispatcher to think that a stabbing had actually occurred because of the yelling, so they sent like 5 squad cars along with the ambulance. They arrived within like 1 or 2 minutes, it was almost spooky how quick it was. I was ok by the time the EMTs arrived, a little shaken up by my dad's behavior--I had cried a bit--but they wrapped it up and had a laugh doing it. It was a good reminder of how ridiculous the whole thing was. I was smiling by the time I got to the emergency room, where I was quite obviously the entertainment on a slow night. Basically every nurse tried to act like they were involved so they could see the girl with a fork in her ass. It was great fun. They didn't really make a production out of it, they just stuck me with some numbing shots and yanked it out, having to cut a favorite pair of pants in the process :(. No stitches necessary. And apparently, according to the EMTs, we had done the right thing not following my dad's advice and just pulling it out then and there. We tried the swiss roll when we got home, it was forking amazing. 

TL;DR On a quest to make my swiss roll pretty, I fork-got that the dishwasher was open and my buns were promptly assaulted by a vengeful utensil

EDIT: I'm a minor so sorry no ass pics but here's some proof: http://imgur.com/qDyMXjo 

EDIT2: wowee this is blowing up I'm happy I'm making u guys laugh :))) and for those asking, the glorious swiss roll: http://imgur.com/TiC3QEE presentation is a little less than top notch but it was damn good. We mashed a couple of recipes together, the cake is lemony and the filling is homemade blackberry jam and cream."
