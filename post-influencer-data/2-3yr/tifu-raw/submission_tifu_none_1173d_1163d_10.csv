"TIFU by ignoring testicle pain


So this happened a few days ago.  Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had just gotten home from work (I work from 9-3) and I decided to take a nap for a few hours before I had to make dinner.  As I was starting to fall asleep I rolled over and then felt a weird pain in my left testicle.  It didn't feel like it had been hit, but rather like it was being squeezed.  I assumed I was laying on it or something and rolled again, but the pain stayed.  I wanted nothing more than to sleep and I knew if I had laid on it the pain wouldn't just go away instantly, so I tried my best to ignore it and managed to fall asleep.  This would turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life.

I woke up 2 hours later and I felt like my dick and I felt a pain greater than anything that I've ever felt.  My left testicle felt like it had been attacked by a cobra, and was having it's life slowly squeezed from it.  I knew right then something was wrong, I've been hit in the balls before, but this is something else.  I reached down to feel it and the whole thing just felt weird. My parents weren't home (I'm 17) and there was no way I'd be able to drive myself to the hospital, so I had to call my neighbor who rushed me there.  The pain was just getting greater as time passed to the point where I threw up out her car window at one point.

The first thing they did when I got there was give me some morphine.  This helped me a little, and I was able to stay still long enough for them to do an ultrasound.  While they were comparing my balls, the doctor told me that I was most likely dealing with testicular torsion.  For those of you who have only heard of that from Cards Against Humanity but have no idea what it actually is, basically it's when the spermatic cord twists, and cuts off the blood flow to the testicle.  If it isn't treated soon enough, the testicle could die and have to be amputated.  The doctor gave me a lot of crap for going back to sleep instead of taking the pain seriously, because I was really cutting it close time wise and they weren't completely sure if they were going to be able to save it.

I learned that the way to fix it would be to perform a surgery where they cut open the scrotum and manually untwist the cord.  They put me under, and I went to sleep praying that they would be able to save my testicle.

They couldn't.

Today's the first time I haven't been heavily medicated since the surgery, and I want to use this TIFU as a PSA.  If you think something might be wrong with your balls, TREAT IT LIKE IT'S SERIOUS.  I already have a low sperm count, and the doctor told me it's very unlikely that I'll be able to have kids now that I can only produce half as much.  Please guys, take care of your testicles.

TL;DR: Decided sleep was more important than my balls, lost half of the Juice Crew

Edit:  Holy shit gold!  Thanks for the support everyone.

Edit 2:  Anyone wondering how I know I have a low sperm count I did a test last year.  There's a history of infertility in my family and I took a test to know if having kids would be a possibility somewhere down the line"
"TIFU by flicking my hair


So this morning I jumped in the shower and decided to wash my hair. I have very long and curly hair that reaches midway down my back. However, once its wet the curls straighten out and my hair almost reaches my bum. 

So hair is wet, shampooing done and I just need to rinse. I tip my head back and flip my hair over my shoulder ala shampoo adverts everywhere. And feel something brush against the top of my bum. Being the mature and logical gal I am, I came to the one and only possible conclusion. 

Spider

With a scream a howler monkey would be proud of, boobs flying and looking like some sort of demented mermaid, I attempted to flee the shower stall. And promptly acquired a new skill; the ability to do the splits.  

This in itself was a spectacular feat of physics as there isn't actually enough room in my bathroom for a toddler to do the splits, never-mind a 5'9"" half drowned rat. As a result, when my leading foot came into contact with the toilet pedestal my body was launched back along the floor towards the shower. This  left me wedged between the toilet and the shower tray.

Where I was abruptly bitch-slapped by the shower door.

One trip to A&amp;E later and I have a sprained ankle, a fractured ankle, two broken toes, a beautiful rainbow of bruises in some interesting places and a partridge in a pear tree.

**TL, DR: Upon learning that my hair now reaches my bum I; preformed gymnastics worthy of Rio, made the laws of physics my bitch and took a guided tour of the local hospital.**  

**UPDATE:** So because I’m a special little unicorn my broken toes and fractured ankle are on opposite feet therefore I’m now rockin a bitchin new wheelchair (well not new, it’s the NHS and its Scotland). Also my flat is upstairs so it might as well be on Everest, so I’m at my parents bungalow until my sprain is well enough for me to find another way to fuck it up.

I’ve had the wheelchair for about 6hrs now and have bounced it off every door frame in the house and scuffed two of the walls (don’t tell my mother). After about 2hrs of me bouncing around like a ping pong ball my mum got the shits with me and told me to go and annoy my younger brother, who is playing xbox in the living room. So after letting him have a go on the chair and basically pissing about, he says 3 little words that have resulted in this update.
 
“Do a wheelie”

Fucking challenge accepted. I give it a go and end up tipping the chair backwards, arse over tits (which I’m sure would, again, be flying if they hadn’t been secured in a locked and upright position) and cracking my head on the fireplace. I’m now on my back doing the world’s worst impression of an upside down turtle with a cast and now a head wound. My 19yr old, apparently adult brother is trying to crawl to the bathroom before pisses himself laughing.

So now I’m back in A&amp;E waiting to get glued back together.

**TL, DR: Was challenged to a wheelchair wheelie which resulted in; me becoming gravity's bitch again, a grown man almost wetting himself and a second guided tour of A&amp;E.**  

UPDATE 2: No I haven’t injured myself again. So after seeing the same Dr I saw during my first trip in, I thankfully don’t have a skull fracture or concussion. I’ve just split the skin which was fixed with glue and tape because apparently medical and art supplies are the same thing. I’m also back in the wheelchair as the very wise Dr felt “crutches would just be asking for it”. He’s not wrong I full admit I would have attempted to swing from them and/or use them as pirate swords.  Though most likely both.

So I thought I’d check Reddit on the way home and holy shit. I was not expecting this response!! I just thought a few people would stop to point and laugh at the clumsy twat and move on. I caught wee bro before he left for work and showed him, he told me “you need to tell them the freezer story, that was just fucking insane”. So after I’ve caught some sleep, read all the comments etc, I may write that one up if anyone is interested.  So to all of you who took the time to read this and those of you who commented thank you.

Also, thank you to the person who gilded this I have no idea what that means but I’m fucking excited about it. As soon as I figure out how to figure out who did it your name will be up here in shiny lights, or black and white at least.    

EDIT: I've been given two reddit gold? I didn't know you could have more than one. So I'd like to thank /u/i_pk_pjers_i for one Reddit Gold and I'm still trying to figure out who my second came from. Also I promise to write up my escapade with the freezer once I've had some sleep.

EDIT 2: Holy shit batman, I can not believe the response this has gotten. Seriously people thank you, I've read through a good majority of your comments and some have made me peeing myself. I'm not sure if I'll be able to respond to everyone but I will try. However, before I do, I just have to thank /u/mariusbalaban and /u/HaikuSorrow as well as two others who are currently anonymous for the reddit golds. 

Also for those who are interested I'll be posting my freezer story as soon as I finish this edit.

"TIFU by accidentally waterboarding myself.


So this fuck-up took place last week, at my nephew's 6th birthday party. 

We were having this party at my parents house by the lake, and we have this floating divingboard thing like 10-15 meters out from the 'beach'. So people were swimming, diving, generally just having a blast.

My nephew's favorite thing is Spiderman, he fucking loves Spiderman. So I dressed up in a Spiderman-looking morphsuit. You know the green tight suit 'hilarious' guys wear, yeah, that kind.

So I suited up, and after a while I decided to go swimming in said suit. I swam out to the floating divingboard, climbed up and got ready to jump. 

Dived into the lake, swam 3-4meters underwater, then resurfaced. When I came up for air, I quickly realized that the morph suit drastically looses its ability to let air through the breathing points when it gets wet. The thing is, the morph suit is really hard to take of, it unzips at the back of your head, which is a tricky spot to reach when you're basically drowning. So I tried to remove it by taking my hands behind my head, which resulted in me sinking into the water. I repeated this process of going up trying to breathe, and sinking from trying to take of the morph suit. 

Eventually I had to be rescued by my older brother. 


**TLDR: Dived into a lake with a morphsuit on, couldn't breathe, had to be rescued by my older brother.**

**EDIT: Rip inbox, thanks to everyone telling me how fucking stupid I am. I wholeheartedly agree..**

**EDIT 2: I appreciate every condecending message trying to teach me about waterboarding, and how they wished I had died.**

**EDIT 3: YES, I know this wasn't a case of Guantanamo Bay waterboarding. YES, I know I wouldn't last two seconds with real waterboarding. YES, I'm clearly a pussy and you would destroy me. Get the fuck out of here with your guerrilla warfare training.**

**EDIT 4: I'm aware that waterboarding is a highly sensitive/touchy subject, and at no point did I try to make fun of waterboarding as it some of the worst shit you can do to a person. I'm not trying to make jokes,  this is /r/tifu  not fucking /r/funny. Realise that.**"
"TIFU by going to my wife's first antenatal appointment


This happened last month, but I didn't think to post it here.


Wife had her first antenatal appointment last month, during which they needed to do a blood test. I have a huge irrational phobia of needles. Every time I have had to go for a blood test or a vaccination, I have passed out. I know my fear is irrational, but due to the passing out, the fear has just gotten worse over the years.


I figured since it wouldn't be me who would be getting the blood test done, I should be fine as long as I don't look. So as the nurse is taking the blood, I looked away and shut my eyes, but I could hear the nurse talking, she was having trouble getting drawing blood for some reason and my wife made sounds of pain. Instantly I started feeling dizzy, so I asked to leave the room.


I got up, left the room, and next thing I know I'm waking up from an awesomely deep sleep on the floor with more doctors around me than I have seen in my life. It took a while to remember what happened, I just felt like I woke up from an amazingly deep sleep. As I was quite confused as to what had happened, I tried to get up only to feel a horrible pounding in my head and bad neck pain. 


The doctors stopped me from getting up, and were doing their own thing, one taking blood to check my sugar level (which almost caused me to pass out again) because I hadn't had any food that day, another doing something on my arm which I wound find out about later. Apparently I hit the ground quite hard, and injured my neck. They ended up keeping my the whole day for observation. They done a CT scan for my neck and brain. Had signs of a concussion.


The doctors had put a neck strap on me, and I wasn't allowed to sit up until the scan results came back. When they finally let me sit up, ignoring the pain, everything else felt fine..... until I felt itching on my arm.


I scratched, and felt something odd. I looked down to notice the guy earlier had put an IV in my arm. I'm not sure why, because it was never used. Looked up at my wife, and said ""there's something in my arm"" and I couldn't stop the panic. She said my face went extremely pale. Next thing I know, I'm again waking up from an extremely deep sleep, thinking I'm still at home in bed, only to find I am surrounded by a crap load of doctors again. It took a few seconds to remember where I am again.


My wife said the heart rate monitor started beeping, and a crap load of doctors ran in.


Once I recovered, they teased me for quite a bit until they discharged me. They ended up putting a bandage around the IV so I don't see it again. There was an old lady visiting her husband in the same ward, who also teased me. ""Don't fall asleep again! You almost gave us a heart attack!"".


When they finally discharged me, the nurse, a very butch polish lady teased me about passing out, and said ""now it's time for me to wax you"". Confused, I said ""what?"". She said : ""You're a hairy guy. They used a lot of tape on your arm...."". She was very rough. The hair on my arm hasn't still fully grown back. :/


TL;DR: Wife went for antenatal appointment. I ended up passing out twice and almost giving an old lady a heart attack, and got waxed by a butch polish nurse.

EDIT: whoa, front page for the first time.

EDIT: Oh man, I'm so glad I'm not the only one who has this issue. It's actually very reassuring, albeit still very humiliating.


EDIT: OH MAN! Gold! Thank you so much kind redditor! I'm glad you enjoyed my screw up :)


EDIT: Just FYI, we had a miscarriage. Not disheartened, we'll try again. Hopefully next time I won't humiliate myself at the antenatal appointment. :)"
"TIFU by destroying a friendship in a most spectacular fashion.


Good god. I can't believe I'm actually about to type this out. This is literally the worst thing I've ever done and it was completely on accident.  It's gonna be a long one so buckle the fuck up.   
  
Some quick context: I'm in my mid-30s and so are the other people in this story. Making friends outside of work in your 30s isn't impossible, but it's very strange and uncomfortable and most dudes avoid it. The gentleman that this story revolves around is one of the very few real friends I've organically made in this stage of my life. I've changed the names of everyone involved.   
  
Alright. Here we go.   
  
Last week I gave my buddy Craig a ride home from work since we work in the same building and got off at the same time. He wanted to stop by the bar that both his wife and our friend Nate work at. It's right next to their house. Nate and I had become real friends about a year ago after him and my wife had a heated debate about Star Wars Battlefront. We've been BFFs since. Anyway, Nates's bartending and we sit down and shoot the shit for a few.   
Now Nate had just moved into a new apartment right down the street. Apparently he had noticed his hot water heater leaking before he went to work and was concerned since he was working an evening into graveyard double. Because Nate is a good person and trusts Craig and I, he asked if we could go check on it for him to ease his mind. We say sure, take his key, and walk down the street to his apartment.   
Once inside, my propensity for harmless mischief overtakes me.   
""This place is nice but could really use a few dicks"", I say to Craig as I whip out my Sharpee. Craig rightly suggests that instead of permanently applying ink to both personal and rented property, I should instead draw dicks on tiny pieces of paper and hide them around the apartment. I agree that is much better.  
I begin looking through Nate's drawers for Post-Its or something similar but found nothing. He's a single dude in his 30s living alone in a one bedroom apartment that he moved into 6 days ago. There's just not accumulated junk around like I'm used to.   
In the tiny chunk of counter next to his stove, however, there's a smallish yellow piece of paper that looks like a carbon copy of a receipt with some little orange tabs stuck to it. Next to it is the ring of a milk cap and a crumpled Del Taco receipt and I remember realizing there wasn't a trash can and chuckling to myself about how if I didn't have my wife to literally keep me alive, I too would have forgotten to buy a trash can when moving in somewhere and would just deal with it rather than rushing out and buying one.  
So I take this yellow piece of paper and start tearing off tiny chunks (maybe an inch by half an inch) and begin drawing dicks on them. Craig and I are giggling in a way that only grown-ass men doing something incredibly childish do - manically and incessantly. Each dick is funnier and veinier than the one that preceded it and the hiding spots around his apartment become more and more obscure. We hid a dick between his couch cushions. We taped a dick on the underside of his kitchen cabinet. We put a dick inside his shaving kit. We put a dick inside a shaker of oregano so that someday while he's cooking spaghetti and the oregano isn't coming out the way it should, he'll unscrew the lid and find a tiny dick staring back at him. Our goal was to make sure he'd be finding these for months, if not years and smile whilst cursing our names.   
After about 20 dicks, I got sick of drawing them and started writing little inspirational messages like ""Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" and ""Vaccines cause autism - wake up sheeple"". As a double whammy, we taped one behind his shower head that has a drawing of a dick ejaculating but the puddle of semen says ""Bush did 9/11"".  
It was a masterpiece of whimsical fuckery and we laughed all the way back to the bar.   
Upon our return, we told him of the gifts we had bestowed upon him and we laughed and laughed and laughed. Nate laughed too but in a ""you guys are dicks and I can't believe you're my friends"" kinda way.   
I've been drying out to curb what was becoming a pattern of self-medicating problem drinking so I didn't really want to stick around the bar for too long. I decided to take off and went home and fell asleep still quietly giggling to myself about the hilarity of the thing that we'd done. Nate had been pretty depressed for the last 6 months or so and I loved that for the next year or more, he'd be finding little love notes from Craig and I to remind him he's not alone. It was a gift that would keep on giving.   
   
Okay. Here's the part that's really, really hard to type.  
  
The next morning around 11am, I get a series of texts from Craig, which is odd because he's never awake before 2pm. He tells me that we've fucked up and we've fucked up big time.   
  
Turns out that carbon copy receipt I tore up wasn't just a carbon copy receipt. Nope, it wasn't that at all.  
On the back of it, which I never bothered to look at, was a goofy love letter from Nate's girlfriend.  
Nate's girlfriend - who was hit by a drunk driver on the freeway and killed 6 months ago.  
  
I walked into a man's home, picked up one of the last physical reminders of his dead girlfriend, ripped it into 30 pieces, drew dicks on those pieces, and hid them all over his house for him to find for the next year.   
  
If I had spent a month in seclusion manically plotting how to hurt Nate in the worst way possible, I could have never come up with something so utterly fucked up. It was like a precisely focused laser beam of flamboyant disrespect.   
 
Of course I immediately texted him as I knew there was no way he'd accept a call from me. I sincerely apologized while offering no excuses and accepting full responsibility, imploring him to not blame Craig as it wasn't his idea. I didn't want their friendship to be ruined as well; plus Craig's wife works with Nate every day and she is the sweetest person ever and I couldn't deal with him lumping her in on this and ruining a work relationship as well. At the end of the day, it really was 100% my fault and those two awesome people shouldn't suffer for my horrible mistake.   
  
As I'm sure you guessed, Nate has never responded to my texts and that's to be expected. I'm sure he has written me off forever as the worst person ever and he's not wrong. I've never done something so unforgivably awful to another person in my entire life and it will haunt me to the grave, I'm sure. I haven't slept for more than 2 hours a night in the past week and when I do, I dream that Nate has either forgiven me or revealed that it was a joke and it really was just an old carbon copy receipt. Every morning I wake up relieved and then reality sets in and I hate myself a little bit more.   
  
What I did was completely unforgivable and I don't expect him to ever forgive me. I hope he does someday though. Until then, the image of him finally getting home at 7am with a begrudging grin knowing the goofiness that awaits him inside and instead finding his momento torn asunder and suddenly and horrifically putting the pieces together while openly weeping alone in the tiny kitchen of a 400 sq ft apartment will haunt me for the rest of my natural life. I did that to a person and I did it trying to be funny. Nothing's been funny to me since. 

I haven't really told anyone about this so thanks for reading.

"TIFU by accidentally shutting down a bread factory.


This happened when I was a teenager, working in a bread factory for the summer. I mostly worked on the production line feeding hot-dog bun pans onto a conveyor belt, but I also had to do cleaning duties like emptying the garbage canisters full of swelling leftover dough, and sweeping the floors.

I was pushing one of the stiff push-brooms on this particular morning, and was cleaning the area close to the end of the factory line. Finished loaves of bread were rolling by on the conveyor belt, ready to be bagged.  

As I pulled back the broom to make another push forward, I accidentally stuck the arse-end of the broom into the underside of the conveyor belt.  The machine responded to this indignity by making a sickening mechanical sound, and the belt strained, buckled, and then ruptured.  The beautiful brown loaves of bread all started spilling onto the floor.  It was clear that I had done some serious damage.

I glanced around to see if anyone had noticed what had happened yet. They hadn’t, so I quickly mulled over my options.  I decided it would be best to run away.

I took my broom and discreetly started sweeping away from the scene of the accident.   I kept sweeping in the opposite direction until I swept myself right into the adjacent room.  After what seemed an eternity, someone finally spotted the mayhem, and I started to hear yelling.  

Someone quickly stopped the factory line.  I kept up my sweeping routine, and watched a crowd develop out of the corner of my eye.

Workers started to gather at the crime scene, and I decided that I would look guilty if I didn’t go over and look at the carnage like everyone else.  I took a deep breath and wandered over with the most curious and innocent look on my face that I could muster.

The foreman was already there, and a lot of other workers, and they were sifting through the evidence to try and find the cause of the malfunction.  One guy took his work boot, and used his toe to push aside some loaves of bread that lay on the floor.  He spotted something and called over to the foreman.

I looked closer too, and saw that they had discovered large splinters of wood that lay on the floor.  The foreman thought about this for a second, and then he looked up to study the conveyor.  After a few seconds, he spotted something else, and reached up to pull two more sizeable splinters out of the conveyor belt.  He looked confused and he conferred with one of the other workers to try and figure out what had happened.

At this point, I was just as curious as anyone where the splinters fit into all this, and I remember thinking that I had caused more damage than I had realized.  It was just after that precise thought when I glanced down at my broom.  What I saw made me immediately sick to my stomach.  

The top-end of my broom was clearly missing some splinters and it was blatantly obvious that the wounds were fresh.  My broom, and the splinters, were a perfect match.  I had been in such a hurry to leave the scene that I hadn’t even noticed my broom.  It was as if I had showed up at a murder scene, for a murder that I was responsible for, and was proudly brandishing the murder weapon and handing out bright red balloons to everyone.

I quickly stuffed the end of the broom under my armpit to hide the evidence, and I pretended that I was just as shocked and perplexed as anyone as to what had happened.  I spotted another broom just like mine in the next room, and I managed to get in there without drawing anyone’s attention.  I hid my splintered broom behind a door, grabbed the fresh broom, and continued sweeping and gossiping about the incident.  I was never caught, but they had to stop all production for a couple of hours while they repaired the damage I had caused.

TL;DR  Accidentally stuck a broom in a conveyor belt at a bread factory, and shut down the entire factory for a couple of hours.

"TIFU by electrocuting myself and immediately shitting all over my bed


EDIT: Thank you so much to whoever gilded this. Wow, this really blew up. 

This happened during this week, but I hadn't been able to post it on here until now.

My bedside table has a lamp, my phone, a full can of drink, and a bag of crisps on it. The lamp has a lead which runs down to the floor and is plugged into a 4 point extention plug which i also use to charge my laptop, phone, and whatever else needs power.

So i'm laying in bed, my mind fully on a game I'm playing on my laptop when my phone rings. Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but because I'm so immersed in my game, I reach over without looking and promptly knock the lamp over, which in turn knocks everything else on the table over and sends the can of drink on a suicide run down the side of my bed.

After much swearing and hurridly picking up my phone and the lamp, it suddenly occurs to me that coca cola and electricity might not be the best combination in the world, and I instinctively reach down to pull the lead out.

Unfortunately, despite having been told in childhood not to play with fire, run with scissors, talk to strangers, or indeed put my fingers near a live electrical socket. in the brief panic, all that common sense departs my brain, and I'm left grabbing down the side of the bed, frantically pulling at plugs that are dripping with sugary soda

It's roughly 3 or 4 seconds later when the most intense stinging pain i've ever felt in my life shoots through my hand, and by some miracle I jerk my hand back as the entire plug makes a popping noise and starts to smell of charred plastic and burned fingertips.

It's within those first few moments, somewhere between the thoughts of ""Oh my God, I'm still alive"" and ""Damn, I hope my laptop charger is ok"" that a strange gurgling sound eminates from the depths of Hell known as my stomach.

The human race has evolved for millennia to have a fight or flight instinct, and when faced with a massive scare, is well known for dropping it's... uh...baggage at the first oppertunity.

So it is with great horror I realise, as I lay there in my nice comfortable bed, that my body has decided that now, of all times, would be the perfect moment to let rip with a stream of hot mushy diarrhea.

Gee, thanks anus, you really shouldn't have.

As I struggle to my feet, I feel it emerging, like a beast from a pit, bursting it's way into this world.

I make it to my knees, and look around, There's no way i'm gonna get to the bathroom in time, and having to navigate the bedroom, the hall way, and a small set of stairs to the toilet seems a challange akin to climbing Mount Everest.

There's only one thing I can do. I grab the bag of crisps and slam it against my erupting anus.

But of course, the bag is far too small, and not even close to being properly positioned, and the horrific gush of shit swiftly overwhelms it like a flood.

There has to be another way, I think, briefly considering my clothing, my bed sheets, or a pillowcase... YES! Thank you pillowcase, I knew you would come in handy one day!

The pillowcase, in it's delicate cream and blue coloring quickly joins the crisp packet, It won't hold long, but it stems the flow just long enough for me to make my escape.

I run to the bathroom with the speed of The Flash...if The Flash was covered in his own poop... hurling myself towards the toilet at near light speed.

30 minutes later I emerge, in shock, but no longer spraying shit like a burst sewer pipe

I survey the damage.

There's shit on my bed, down my legs, up my arms, across the floor, infact there's probably more areas of my bedroom covered with my own shit than I ever thought possible.

I begin the long, slow, and disgusting job of clearing up, and think to myself, at least one thing came out of this. I can finally post something on TIFU

Oh, and I found out the phone call was just a marketing call after all that... Fuck my life.

TL:DR got an electric shock from dropping a soda on a live socket and shit myself in bed"
"TIFU and tested the temperature of candy with my finger.


When I was fifteen, I made the brilliant decision to make my own caramel candies. Having had no candy making experience whatsoever, I told myself ""how hard can it be?""

I gathered my sugar, milk, water, and got to cooking. Now I personally prefer my sauces on the thicker side, so I significantly diminished the amounts of milk and water called for. After maybe twenty minutes I have not caramel, but a thick brown gunk in the pot. It looks more polyjuice potion than caramel. And worst of all, it's not visibly cooking. It's just sorta sitting there.

Being a stupid, stupid teenager, I take this as a sign that mixture is cold. I stick a spoon in and pull it out. The stuff is thicker than syrup, but still somewhat fluid. I decide to test the temperature the easy way.

FU 1. I drizzled a large clump of the goop onto my finger.

Here's a fun fact: caramelized sugar can reach temperatures of up to 338°F. For you normal people, that's 170°C. (Thanks for the correction, chefs!)

The sugar is that special kind of hot. So hot that it feels blistering cold, and my body immediately rejects it. I lost the ability to scream, to think rationally. All I can focus on is the hell that's unfolding on my finger. I clawed at the goop violently and yanked.

Somewhere between the yanking and the rip, I felt a sort of hardness. I assumed this was a chunk of solidified sugar, and it was this chunk I ripped at.

FU 2. It wasn't a piece of hard sugar. It was my fingernail.

I can honestly say I've known pain so intense I vomited. This was that pain. I spin around to the sink and after a few moments, empty what remains of my lunch. Then, I think to myself ""some water would sure help my finger!""

Wrong. Half my nail is gone, meaning my nerves are exposed. Meaning that touching even lukewarm water is like shoving my finger into a damn newborn star.

For maybe a second, I blacked out. Long enough to fall, but short enough that I awoke before hitting the ground.

About this time, my sanity kicks in. My finger needs medical attention. So I turn off the water, the stove, and head to the hospital which luckily is only five minutes away.

Long story short, I got taken care of (thank scientists for morphine) and spent the next few days in haze of pain meds. I got second degree burns on my finger, and permanent nerve damage to my finger.

I learned my lesson. I haven't tried to make carmel to this day.

TL;dr I put hot caramel on my finger and got burned for it. In the throes of agony, I ripped off half of my own nail.

Edit: Whoa! Didn't expect this to be so well received. Thank you all! I've gotten a few questions so here are the answers. 

-My parents were not present. My dad was in another state, and my mom working. The hospital called her shortly after I was in, and she came right over. 

-Yup, the pot had to be thrown away. RIP my favorite boiling pot. 

-My skin and nail grew back. I've lost most feeling in the finger, though. 

-No idea why it's a question, but I'm a girl."
"TIFU by sitting on a public toilet.


My boyfriend and I are regulars at this bar/restaurant in Austin. One day we went in there and had quite a few drinks. I had to pee pretty bad and when the person came out of the stall I ran in and just sat quickly. Usually I don't sit on public toilets unless I know it's a nice place and (usually) always clean. Well I sit down and feel something squish under me. In shock I stood quick and looked down... Someone shit ON the seat. I'm also not talking like a solid shit... This was like a soft serve shit. As I stood up, it went all down INTO my pants, all over my legs etc. I freaked out.. I wiped it up  the best I could while gagging and had to walk through the f*n restaurant probably smelling horrible to the front to get my boyfriend. He saw me and immediately knew something was wrong. I dragged him into a stall with me and he had to ask the bartender for wet wipes. I was mortified... Obviously everyone thought I shit myself. 
I had to throw out the pants I was wearing and wear my boyfriends pants. He wore his sweatshirt as pants home. 

All in all...I never go back there.. But I have a good boyfriend, and also ALWAYS LOOK AT THE TOILET BEFORE YOU SIT. NO MATTER WHAT."
"TIFU by being naive after a car accident


Got hit by someone on the way to church today. Got out, and immediately APOLOGIZED for the accident taking place. He takes advantage of it, tries to convince me it was my fault, and almost gets me to pay for paint remover for him, even though my car had *far worse damage. I leave, and only afterwards do I learn it was not my fault at all, that I am a complete idiot, and that I should have called the cops immediately and gotten all of his information instead of being an apologetic wreck and being afraid to demand for his info because I thought I was somehow at fault. 

tl;dr I am too naive to be an adult, please help me

Edit: This is my first post to get anywhere near over 100 up votes to my knowledge, so this is blowing me away a bit. Thank you all for your kindness and advice, I will take it to heart and make sure to keep my head level in a similar situation in the future! 

Edit 2: I am not Canadian! I was born and bred in the southern US, currently residing in Louisiana :) 

*For all wondering how bad the damage actually was, it turns out that I had panicked and thought the damage was much worse than it was. In the end I am just left with a gash where the paint is gone in my bumper, but beyond that it isn't broken or dented (like I thought it was). I am incredibly blessed that that was all it was! (For the record, though, my car is still worse for it than the other guy's!) "
"TIFU by going to Ikea alone.


Happened 2 days ago, been a long time lurker and made an account just for this.  Basically I'm on leave before I start my new job.  Since my wedding is coming up real soon I thought I'd be productive and go shopping for furniture for the fiance before she moves in.

So I decide to buy a DOMBÅS 3 door wardrobe which comes in 2 packages, one about 40kg and the other about 47kg.  I didn't take it as a warning when I was struggling to carry both onto the trolley. (thanks to how massive the packages were)

And to cut a long story short, as I was carrying one of the packages to the car, it slipped from my hands because I was basically gripping it stupidly, and slammed into my right toe.  Fracturing it, and ruining all my plans for the next few weeks.  I may potentially still be hobbling when it's time to go for our pre-wedding photoshoot.

TLDR: Went to Ikea along, dropped 40kg worth of furniture on right big toe and ruined all my plans for the next few weeks.

Edit:  Wow, did not expect this to hit front page!  The conversations here are amazing!"
"tifu by locking a baby bear in my garage


I was woken up at around 3am by some rustling going on outside. I knew right away a bear was making a mess somewhere near by. I look out my window and sure enough a black bear has managed to lift my garage door and has made an awful mess of my garbage. So I do what I usually do when a bear is in my yard and run outside yelling profanity grasping a broom and banging it on the siding. Sure enough the bear has had enough of my yelling and fucks off. 

Now here's where I fucked up. I closed my garage door. Now I can hear this fucking bear making an awful lot of noise off in the distance. Sort of like a deeper more menacing dog cry. I open up the side door and sure as shit there's a little black bear cub deep within the mess of my garage crying away. And I can still hear mom crying away in the distance. So I bolted inside and called the non emergency line for the police. I just need some help getting my garage door open (it won't open from the outside) so this cub can get out of my garage. Well apparently there's no one on duty at 3 am so I'm stuck here listening to this awful crying outside. 

TLDR; Scared a momma bear out of my yard and locked a baby bear in my garage by accident. Now I can't sleep due to bears 
crying.

Edit; here's the photo the police took for me http://imgur.com/JLaB3Vq

Edit; the baby bears are gone now! I'm hopeing they rejoined their mom to go and destroy more garbage cans and roam around the neighborhood. Thank you all for all the help and advice!"
