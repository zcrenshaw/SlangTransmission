"TIFU by claiming tea that wasn't mine, leading to a colleague taking offense and hundreds of pounds worth of damage to my workplace.


Me and my boss have a pretty great relationship. Lots of banter, elaborate practical jokes- it makes the working environment a much better place. Between us, that is. 

I'm the only one to have that kind of back-and-forth with him. All my colleagues (much older Polish men who generally don't speak English very well, save for one or two who act as translators) he's always brusque and professional. The Polish workers are the first at the factory and the last to leave, so he often writes hand-written instructions for the work they have to complete; as such, they're familiar with his handwriting, a fact which will become important later on.

This morning, whilst making myself and my colleague Piotr a cup of tea as he operated a machine, my boss comes into the canteen. Piotr brings in his own tea. It's some kind of special infusion citrus aroma thing, it smells nice, lots of pictures of flowers on the outside, pretty expensive stuff. My boss asks me whose tea it is. 

I could have told him it was Piotr's and that would have been the end of it. But, for reasons inexplicable even to myself, I found myself telling him it was mine. Perhaps I knew that he would crack a few jokes over it and wanted some early morning entertainment. Maybe my brain was still only half-awake and it was a genuine mistake. Whatever the cause, I found myself claiming ownership, and- as expected- received a barrage of well-meaning abuse. I chuckled, put the tea back and returned outside with a cup for myself and for Piotr.

What I will now tell you I have managed to piece together through talking to others, my own detective work, and some natural deduction. At lunchtime Piotr and two of his friends were crowded around the cupboard in the canteen, all talking animatedly. Piotr was shouting whilst his friends seemed to be trying to placate him. It seems that my boss, believing the tea to be mine, took it upon himself to tape the following label to the tin:

Now my boss telling me this was a simple expression meaning he thought it was ridiculous tea. Due to a cruel twist of fate, however, Piotr- the tea’s true owner- is a homosexual who it seems had left his last job due to cruel and constant taunting over his sexual orientation. He believed the expression ‘shove it up your arse’ to be targeted at his homosexuality. It seems he went on a rant in Polish, questioning which of his friends told our boss, asking how dare he put that on his tea, declaring that simply because he was gay did not mean that he took pleasure from throwing anything he could get his hands on up there. The more he shouted, the angrier he got, until he stormed from the building into his car to eat his lunch alone.

This is yet another cruel twist of fate, leading me to wonder whether all these coincidences really weren’t coincidences after all but some kind of cosmic joke beyond my understanding. Last night Piotr had bought himself a bottle of Krupnik, a Polish alcohol, on his way home from work and had forgotten to take it out of his car. As such it remained when he entered for his lunch, and in his anger and frustration he decided one drink couldn’t hurt and before he knew it the man was inebriated. My boss, out of the factory at lunchtime to buy himself fish and chips, was unaware of the events unfolding.

Immediately after lunch Piotr was needed on the forklift. This I wasn’t witness to, but it seems as soon as the vehicle lurched backwards some people guessed what had happened and ran to stop him; alas, it was too late. All I heard was a tremendous crash that echoed around the factory, and running out found that the forklift had careered into- and straight through- the factory doors. 

Piotr has walked out of the factory in a rage and hasn’t returned since. My boss, learning what had happened, is now looking for me, furious and in need of a scapegoat. I am currently hiding in the toilets and will remain here until the end of the day. 

Tl;dr I told my boss I owned some tea which wasn’t mine, he left a note telling me to shove it up my arse, a gay Polish man took it as discrimination, got drunk and crashed a forklift through the factory doors, completely destroying them.



UPDATE: With little left to do today anyway I have slunk out of the back door unnoticed and driven home. Some may call this cowardly: those people would be correct. There is another reason I didn't go talk to my boss and Piotr, though. When I left the toilets I could hear them having a screaming match along with one of Piotr's friends in the canteen. With my boss so angry and feeling guilty, he may well have fired me in front of the other workers; being a proud man, I think it would then be very unlikely for him to take me back. I'm leaving in 6 weeks anyway, but I need that next paycheck! Anyway, it'll be safer to talk in the morning.

Here's a picture of the ruined door since covered up by plasterboard. I've blacked out details of the company I work for.

http://imgur.com/a/8mF0a



FINAL UPDATE: Okay, so thankfully things seem to have gone swimmingly. Coming into work this morning my boss called me into his office. Instead of a tirade, I apologised for him and started to explain, and he cut me off with an apology of his own. It was literally like a 'I'm sorry' 'no I'M sorry!' type thing after which we both laughed and patted each other on the back. Turns out he came to an agreement with Piotr after figuring out what had happened- Piotr will stay, on the understanding that if there's one step out of line he's out, and he's not going to take my boss's note any further. The forklift accident will go down as simply an accident. He has since offended another person during the day, but as that is not my fuck up the story will remain untold. Thank you all for your kind support- I'll remember the advice when something like this inevitably happens again."
"TIFU By being a shady milk man


This happened earlier this morning.  

I work for a dairy distributer that supplies restaurants and grocery stores with milk, cream, etc.  We get to one of our first stops, a small coffee shop at 6:30 am and always walk in the back door, drop off their order, leave a receipt and bounce.  NOT TODAY!  It's cold as shit today so my partner and I are wearing hoodies over our uniforms, as we get to the door it's locked.  Frustrated we try to yank, bang on the door so they'll let us in for about 5 minutes or so.  About when we were gonna say fuck it, we turn around to two cop cars flying into the parking lot, they jump out start screaming at us to freeze, hands up etc.  they do a full felony stop on us because we were reported as burglars. Turns out the coffee shop had a new opener today, a 20 year old college girl who (rightfully so) mistook us for two burly, shady looking thugs trying to break in.  It took about 30 minutes and half dozen phone calls but it's all sorted out now. 

Our boss told us to come back ASAP where we were just given strikes for 1) not wearing appropriate uniform 2) violating professional protocol which doesn't include loudly banging on the retailers locked door.
It was also 'strongly recommended' we write an apology to the shop employee we frightened this morning.

TL:DR-tried to deliver milk to coffee shop, get mistaken for a burglar, cops point guns, slap on handcuffs, but quickly let us leave, formally written up by management.

EDIT: I'm surprised Reddit didn't get me strike 3, cause you fucks blew this post up!

Yes we had cold weather clothes provided, but it wasn't strictly enforced this time of year so we wore our own shit.  This sub is about how I/WE f'd up yesterday so I'm not looking to pass blame off on anyone, but appreciate how some of you were in our corner.  

P.s. Also, glad this post gave the guys with milkmen usernames their overdue chance to shine:)"
"TIFU by being to shy to tell the lunch guy I'm not Muslim


The lunch guy at my job thinks I'm Muslim.
It started off with a subtle ""do you want the Turkey sausage instead"". At this point I'm thinking ""well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage"".  Admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because I'm pretty brown looking, I have a beard, and Arab and Desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. Let's be real, he damn sure didn't think I was Jewish (*funny story: I'm jewish enough to legally immigrate to Israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). 
But I didn't speak up. 
Well today I went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course I pipe up and said ""oh it's fine I'll just eat around it"" which is somewhat true: I don't actually like bacon and I really did just want the pancakes. I must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). Well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if I took the plate just to make it easier for him because then I'd be being a *bad Muslim* just to convenience him. Well then. 
This was the first time that he outright called me Muslim.
Did I come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? No, in fact I'm at my desk wondering what I'm going to do for Ramadan.


Edit:     

1. Thanks for the gold.           

2. The cafeteria guy is a really nice guy, loud, jokes around with everyone in such a way that every morning is almost like a group conversation between me, him, and the rest of the line. It's a great way to start a morning- the guy is very personable. The flipside is that the times where I might privately correct the matter are few and far between.           

3. *That Seinfeld interpretation was absolutely legendary.*          

4. I really wish I would have spelt *too* correctly.           

5. To everyone calling me a p\*ssy, wimp, etc: whatever makes you feel tough I guess. I had quite a bit more to say on the matter but frankly it just wasn't worth the drama.

&gt;TL;DR    
TIFU up by being too shy to speak up and tell the cafeteria guy at my job that I wasn't Muslim, now I'm too deep in the lie, and have to roll with it until I have the courage and, more importantly, right setting to come clean. "
"TIFU by almost getting fired over mayonnaise


This actually did happen today, a few hours ago to be exact. I'm working my normal shift at Wendys (I'm still in school) anyway we're pretty busy and my manager ask me to fill the vanilla frosty machine with frosty mix. So I go into the walk in freezer and get a bag of vanilla frosty mix and pour it into the frosty machine. About 10 minutes later my manager looks pissed and calls me over to the frosty machine i look in and realize I filled it with mayonnaise. My manager starts screaming at me about how i almost broke the frosty machine and made me clean the mayo out with my bare hands and I despise mayo with my entire being 

Tl;dr thought I was filling a frosty machine with frosty mix turned out to be mayo and had to clean it out with my hands and almost got fired 

Edit: everyone saying I'm an idiot this was my first time filling the machine and I've been working here for like 2 months also the next day me and manager laughed about it "
"TIFU by ruining my $1,600 laptop, which ended up costing me another $65,000, another year of my life, and will likely limit my future career prospects.


So of course this didn't happen to me today, but about 6 months ago. I was in the library studying for the hardest test of my first year of medical school. I had a cup of water that I was drinking, without a lid of course, and after a sip I tried to set it back down but it slipped out of my hand and spilled all over my laptop. I turned the laptop upside down and got napkins to try and soak up the water. My battery is not removable without taking off the bottom of the laptop so I just shut it off and hoped for the best. I left it off for a few hours to hopefully let all the water dry, but it had been fried. I was pissed because I had splurged on a MSI GT72 Dominator which was amazing and cost me way too much money. I spent all day taking it apart and trying to dry it out, but I'm pretty sure the motherboard had severe electric damage and so it was a complete day wasted.

I still had a test to study for, which was only a week away so I had to go to walmart and buy a cheap 11"" chromebook to hold me over until my replacement laptop came in the mail. My school has a testing service that we install on our laptops that allows us to be able to take the tests on them, so I installed it on my tiny new chromebook and thought that I was ready for this test.

Here comes the major fuck up, This test was 4 hours long, and I barely finished in time. After we submit our tests we are able to instantly review and are shown our right and wrong answers. I'm going through mine and it's looking okay, not getting everything right, but I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Then I get to a question that doesn't seem to have the right answer provided, and I think, wtf, and start looking more closely at the answer options. It's then that I see the answer options box has the ability to scroll down, and I see that there are 10 possible answers! We had never had 10 possible answers before on any exam and since my computers screen was so small I had only seen 5 and assumed they were all there. So I ended up getting half of those questions wrong because when I answered them, I didn't even see the right answer on my screen. 

I was freaking out and I emailed some people, but got no help and was basically told too bad. It takes about a week for our final scores calculated and released. I knew it was going to be close and when I finaly got them back, I saw that I'd failed by HALF OF 1 PERCENT! Well fuck.

I had to meet with a committee where they told me that because the class was so long, that I wouldn't be able to just retake the test during the summer, which is the normal protocal for someone who fails a class, but that I'd have to repeat the entire first year. So yeah, pretty shitty since this will go on my transcript and makes me less competitive when applying for residencies, so I can basically say goodbye to any of the ultra competitive specialties like Derm or plastics. Pretty cool.

tl;dr Spilled water all over my giant gaming laptop, had to take a test on my new small laptop, could only see half the answers to 10 of the questions and failed my test by half of a percent. Had to repeat the first year of medical school as a result.

Edit: There seems to be some confusion for some people. I am not in any way blaming the test, or my computer, or anyone other than myself for this. I realize that it is entirely my fault that I did not see that there were more answers available, and it was entirely my fault that I'd spilled water on my computer. What I'm saying is that all of this could have been avoided if I had a bigger screen, but I didn't because of MY screw up. If I'd just looked two inches to the right I also would have noticed that there was a scroll option fo the answers, hence, a second FU. I'm not a stupid person, it's just lots of things went wrong for me that week and it is a pretty big bummer that I screwed up so badly.

Edit 2: Since a lot of you are telling me I should have realized the ""right"" answer wasn't there, I'll explain how these 10 questions worked. First off there were only 10 questions that had more than 5 questions. These questions were ""which is the most correct"", type of question. I'll give an example. If I showed you a picture of an apple and said, what color is this apple?

A. Red

B. Green

C. Yellow

D. Mostly red, but there are green spots with most of the green concentrated around the stem.

And D was the description of the picture, then that is the right answer. However if you only had options ABC you would choose Red, because it was MOSTLY Red, even though there was some green included.

So for these 10 questions the right answer WAS always there, however, there was an answer that was ""more right"" available, it's just that I failed to see it."
"TIFU by buying my teacher a laser pointer.


So since the start of my CS class, my teacher had always complained about not having a laser pointer. Instead, she had to use a heavy-ish meter stick, because the board was about 8 ft off the ground. So I thought, hey, wouldn't it be nice of me to buy her a laser pointer. Boy was I wrong.

I went on amazon later that day and found a relatively well priced laser pointer and bought it. This think had all the works. A laser. Buttons for switching slides. A usb-wireless connector. You name it this thing had it. I was super excited to bring this in and give it to her. 

That next class, I decided that I would just leave a note and leave it on her desk, sort of as a anonymous present, just in the hopes that it would brighten her day and make her happy. I wrote the small note, then slyly moved to the front of the class and left it on her desk. As I sat back down in my seat, I noticed that the teacher from the last class and a few TA's had all gathered around the desk with a rather puzzled look on their face. I thought, ""No matter, they just must be surprised that someone left a gift."" Later though, when the teacher came in, she swiftly read the letter, then shuffled the note along with the laser pointer (it was in a box) into her bag. I was very confused why she hadn't just opened it there and then.

After a while, my friend Harley came and joined me in the seat aside to me in the lecture hall. I had told her that I thought it was rather strange, why had both teachers as well as other become flustered when seeing my gift. To which Harley said, ""Well what did the note say?"" I really thought about it, and then I finally told her what it said:

""Dr. Gibson - No more using that big stick :) It needs batteries"" 

That's when I figured it out. I sat there in silence. Harley facepalmed and tried to keep it together. I couldn't believe I was that stupid. Anyway it's been almost 3 weeks (6 class periods) and she still hasn't brought it up. Not sure if she just threw it away or didn't see it. I'm not sure if I should ask. What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Bought my teacher a laser pointer, she thought it was a dildo and threw it away.

Edit: I will be talking to her about it after class next Tuesday, I will let you know how it goes."
"Tifu by buying a colony of baplica dubia roaches online


So I have several reptiles and Dubai roaches are some of the best food I've researched. Unlike crickets and meal worms you don't have to powder or gut load them. They are big slow and won't infest you house. So I built an enclosure for my new colony I ordered and figured I could sell off part of my stock to reduce the numbers so they didn't over populate and kill themselves off. Today my new food source arrived so I opened the box and dumped them into their new home but instead of 100 dubia roaches. I got more like 2000 German cockroaches. Less than half went into the tank even less stayed in it while I fumbled with the lid. My wife now hates me I have an arsenal of raid and combat gel bait. Wish me luck.

Update: Roaches won the battle but not the war. They fried a lot of electronics hence my surprise when I seen all this karma. Called the exterminator $200 later they are kept at bay still see them at night only a few. I feel it's safe to bring my son home at least, thank you all for your support.

Update: seller is no longer a threat and has to give me money. He was an eBay scammer.he took internet pics and information made it look professional as hell. Then he gathered up roaches from his infestation and shipped them to me. He takes jars rubs the inside lip with. Petroleum jelly so they can't get back out. 

PS: to the neigh sayers give my your address I'll send you some free of charge. I have pics but can't figure out how to upload them.

"TIFU by giving my pug some milk


I fucked up real bad. This happened few days ago. Lets get straight to the story.

I was off from work and i had been spending it home alone with my pug. I was eating cookies and milk at the time and my pup Gunther sat right next to me as usually with the saddest eyes in the world. Cookies had some chocolate in them so I couldn't give him a bite but I decided to give him some milk. What's the worst thing that could happen, right?

I know my dog isn't lactose intolerant since he likes to steal food and some of it has been dairy and occasionally we've given him little bit plain yoghurt to help ease his diarrhea etc. and he's been more than fine. But if he drinks or eats too fast and swallows much air, he throws up a little.

Anyway, I pored a little bit milk into his bowl, pug came running all excited because you know, food. He chugged it down and returned to whatever he was doing. A minute later I heard weird noises and when I raised my head I saw a small puddle of milk-vomit he had thrown up. Ah, great. Went to the bathroom for some toilet paper to clean up the mess. 

I'm very sensitive to foul odors and textures, but since it was mainly just milk and saliva, it wasn't too bad. But once I started cleaning, the sliminess hit me and I gaged as usually. And again. And this time I actually threw up, right next to where my pug had thrown up. First reaction was 'well great, now I have two puddles of vomit to clean up'. Then the smell hit me and I immediately threw up into my mouth.

Feeling that there is more to come I ran towards the bathroom. I barely reached the bathroom door when the projectile vomiting started. It sprayed on the toilet, the tank, on the walls and floor, sink and the cabinet below it, mirror, washing machine etc. I got next to the toilet and tried to aim but since pretty much the whole god damn bathroom was covered in vomit, I didn't want to waddle inside it. It all happened so fast. 

While I was there, violently throwing up and crying I heard my dog in the other room had started to eat my vomit. I yelled to him to go to his nest which he did but it was far too late. He had walked in it, eaten some of it, his face was covered in vomit, his nest had some vomit on it. 

We're both good now. After emptying my stomach I cleaned up everything. Bathroom was easier as I pretty much just showered the whole room. But the whole apartment still smells like vomit, including me and Gunther. 



TL;DR Gave my pug some milk, made him throw up. That made me throw up. The smell of my vomit made me throw up even more until I was projectile vomiting. Vomit everywhere. Dog ate some of the vomit. 



 
 

EDIT: Holy shit, my most upvoted post is about me and my pug having puke-fest. That's great.

"TIFU by accidentally taking a melatonin at 4am instead of an ibuprofen


I had to get up at 4am today for work and I am by no means a morning person. Quite the opposite. I woke up with a pounding headache and in a sleep deprived haze I took an extra strength melatonin instead of an ibuprofen. The bottles look quite similar and are right next to each other in the medicine cabinet.

"TIFU by singing ""Rape Me"" in the gym at work.


It's 11:15 and about time I took my morning break.  I went to the gym we have in the office to ride on the bike for a bit.  There's a rule about the office gym, which is to leave it as you found it.  The lights were off and I didn't see anyone in there.  So, I left the lights off and got on the bike.  Once the workout was set up, I put on my music.  I hit 'Shuffle Play' on Spotify, and ""Rape Me"" by Nirvana came on.  
As I was getting into my workout, I started singing.  It got intense.  Rape me...  Rape me...  RAPE ME.

Turns out I wasn't the only one in the gym.  Also turns out that I have a date with HR tomorrow morning."
"TIFU by getting ants on my balls


Just gonna throw a quick didn't-happen-today-but-a-few-months-ago in here and here we go:

I was about 2 months into the relationship that I'm in now, my girlfriend and I were already very comfortable with each other, clothed or not, it was morning time and I needed a shower, so I did what any other person does and showered, I then go for the classic towel move ( I know, classic) and start wiping my body, and balls and que excruciating pain ON MY BALLS, STINGING EVERYWHERE ON MY BALLS. Then  I saw them, the little bastards, ants all over my balls at least 10 or 20 just crawling, burrowing, and biting into my precious sack. I burst into my bedroom where my girlfriend is lying in bed and proceed to yell/explain/cry that there are ants on my balls and I need her help removing them, she didn't even think twice, she just proceeded to, almost robotically, pinch every little bastard ant off.
They were on the towel somehow. 
Lets just say we're still together today.

"Tifu by going to school.


Hey here's something that actually happened today and is currently still happening.

I live on an island so I have to take a boat to school everyday. Today there was a storm warning and we were given the choice on whether or not to go to school. I chose to go.

Now the winds are too strong and the boats are cancelled because it is too dangerous to go on the water. So I am stuck here, possibly over night, possibly the entire weekend as it is supposed to only get worse. Also I have to work tonight and I might not be able to make my shift.

Wish me luck Reddit, hopefully I don't have to live here for the entire weekend.

TL;DR: went to school and now I'm stuck here.

Edit: I should probably note that this was all for a half day of school that lasted a whooping 3.5 hours.

Update: I've made it to Vancouver Island now just a two hour wait and another boat ride that might get canceled. Fingers crossed.

Update #2: convinced someone to buy me ice cream so the day wasn't a total waste.

Update #3: On the second boat and just found out that one of my class mates had to go to the hospital because he was both drunk and high on shrooms and started throwing up. Fun times.

Update #3.5: Stole someone's charger! *(didn't mean to sound so excited about that.)  
Edit the 2nd: Calm down, I know the person, I kinda just unplugged their phone and plugged mine in, saying I stole it may have been an exaggeration. 

Update #4: Finally home. ~8.5 hours of traveling for a 3 hour school day, I think it might not have been worth it. 

Edit the 3rd: (I think) Edit: Wow, never thought I'd see so many Redditors from my area in one place. Gotta love those west coast storms. 

Edit the 4th: Spelling and other stuff."

"TIFU by being a bus hero and breaking a girls nose


So in true tifu fashion this didnt happen today but about a month ago. 
I was on the bus from school to home and at a bus stop a cute girl walked on the bus. So let me just explain that the bus drivers in my city are fucking horrible. Random speed ups and intense braking causes quite some casualties on the bus (casualties=people falling).
So ofc as the girl barely steps on the bus, the bus driver already initiated his fucking hyper engine and drove off at what felt like mach 3. 
So i knew what was going to happen because i've seen many people fall because of stuff like this. And ofcourse being the bus hero i jumped in to save her... But, i didnt really realize at what speed she was actually stumbling towards me and then as i held out my arms i didnt catch her. 
Instead she slammed face first in to my shoulder which broke her nose from the impact (mind that i had my back pack on and the straps are really tough), but ofc the fuck up doesnt stop there. 
As we slammed into eachother we both well backwards and i hit my head on the metal floor part of the bus. 

I blacked out instantly. 

I woke up in the ER and the nurse told me that i had a minor skull fracture and a concussion. Great. 
What made matters worse is that the girl whom i ""saved"" was lying on the second bed next to mine in the room with a bandage over her nose. 

I tried apoligizing but i just couldnt say anything, i was too amazed at my stupidity and i cant even immagine the reaction of the other people on the bus. 

TL; DR 
Tried being a bus hero by saving a girl from falling, ended up breaking her nose and got a fractured skull and concussion. 

EDIT(18.oct. 2016): WOW i never expected my fuck up to get such attention, thanks to all of you for the awesome comments... Even though most of the comments are saying its like a love story and i should talk to her and stuff. But since this is real life i dont even have the balls to approach her... And tbh i dont want to since it would be way too awkward. Thanks again guys and gals. "
