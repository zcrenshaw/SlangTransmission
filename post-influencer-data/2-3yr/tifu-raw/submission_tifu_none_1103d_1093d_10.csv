"TIFU by freezing my whole banks money.


The WHOLE BANK!
A few years ago I was a teller. Every night we balance our drawer and bank our branches 'holdings' to a ledger. 

About three weeks before, we had rolled out a new operating/banking system. 
Going from an old 'green screen' to a Windows based one.

This one evening. I was the sole operator in our branch left to bank my funds to the ledger. 
I did that, locked up ,alarm on....and off I went home. 

The rest of the branches also did their banking nation wide.

The next morning I turn up to work to be told that there was a major system outage and no-one could collect their funds to start the days banking.

Every branch across Australia was unable to release the banking from the ledger.

We had to resort to our emergency operations. Manual transactions and cash withdrawals limited to a certain $$ amount per customer.

The word was the top dogs were screaming blue murder!!! IT couldn't figure it out. 

Then it was discovered.

A certain branch.... had deposited an amount to the ledger.... 

And it had a double decimal in it.

That is all it took to bring the bank to a stand still. 

An extra decimal point.

All they had to do was reverse the deposit and re-enter it. 

Let's just say I had a stern talking to. 

On the upside IT fixed up the formatting so you couldn't do a double decimal again!

EDIT. Not a major bank. Only our branches were affected.

"TIFU by putting my dick to sleep


So you know that pins and needles feeling you get when your arm or leg falls asleep? I got that in my dick. I was sitting with my leg tucked underneath me for a while and my heel was pressed up right behind my balls. I didn't realize it was losing feeling until I stood up and the feeling started to come back. So the pins and needles started in my ballsack and moved up to my dick, and it *did not* feel good. Every little movement felt like I had stuck my dick into an electrical outlet. I was really worried for a second because I didn't know what it was but then I realized and just sat down for a few uncomfortable minutes waiting for it to stop."
"TIFU by suffering explosive diarrhea while my car drove itself into a fast food restaurant


Obligatory ""this didn't actually happen today.""  I don't remember when it was exactly, but it had to have been around 2001.

I'm posting this because I posted it as a comment on an earlier post, and a few people told me they thought my story was WAY worse than the original and deserved its own TIFU...  And yes, what follows is verbatim what I wrote over there.

I was in the fast food drive-thru (building on one side, curb and hedge row on the other - i.e. I can't pull out of line) when my stomach started its death moans... Apparently it was anticipating what was to come and trying to warn me off.

The car in front of me finally moves, I gun it past the window without picking up (or paying for) my food, and almost literally skid sideways into the handicapped spot (illegally) RIGHT outside the door closest to their bathroom. I'm struggling to keep it in at this point, but if I don't get out NOW I'm gonna fertilize the interior of my truck. I get out of the truck and am doing the best I can to sprint for the door while simultaneously clenching my ass muscles as tightly as humanly possible...

I made it to the door before the dam broke... There was a massive trail of liquid shit from the door all the way into the bathroom, and by the time I got my pants down and sat on the toilet I was empty. Not one drop ended up in the toilet. I did the best I could to clean myself and the bathroom up (let's face it, there's no ""cleaning up"" in a public restroom after an event like this) and make a bee-line for the door.

I opened the bathroom door and there stood a very unhappy store manager and a police officer. Behind them was my truck. Sitting inside the entry of the restaurant. In my desperation I forgot to put it in park before I got out and it drove itself through the doors just a few seconds behind me.

Not only did I get tickets for parking in the handicapped spot illegally, and for careless operation of a motor vehicle (for not putting it in park), but I also then had to explain to a judge (and my insurance company) that it all happened while I was shitting myself running through a restaurant, and not because I'm a careless idiot or drunk. The judge actually laughed at me and said ""I don't even care if it's made up, that's the best excuse I've ever heard!"" He dismissed the tickets, which saved me a few hundred dollars. My insurance company was not as amused...

**TL;DR** I shit my pants and all over the floor of a restaurant while my truck drove itself through the front doors.  I got tickets, the judge laughed at me before dismissing them, and my insurance company fought hard to avoid paying for the damages.

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit 2:** This is now my top post...  Glad I could make a few people smile, even though it was at the expense of my dignity.

**Edit 3:** You did it Reddit!  Thank you for completely ruining my internet anonymity!  Apparently this hit the front page some time in the early morning hours while I was sleeping.  I woke up to a text from a good friend who recognized the story, and its taken a considerable bribe to convince him not to tell EVERYONE I know.  In any case, thanks everyone for enjoying my most embarrassing moment, and thanks for the support.  I laugh about it now (and you all probably will too for a long time), but those were definitely the most mortifying moments of my life."
"TIFU by sending my gym partner to the ER


So last night, my gym partner and I decided to go on a late gym run to get SWOLE. I also recently met this beautiful girl on tinder &amp; we've been snapchatting each other as if it was our full time job! She's freaking gorgeous. 

So my gym partner and I decide to go full hulk and bench press as much as we can. On his final set of 275lb bench press, I get a snap from the Tinder girl and it's a video! As I opened up the snapchat, my gym partner asked if I'm all ready to spot him but without thinking, I said yes.. Now here is where I royally fuck up.

As he counts down to start benching, I open up the snapchat &amp; it's a video of the girl with NSFW content, suggesting that we should hit it up tonight. I was completely focused on the 10 second video until I heard a thud and a gag for help... My gym partner lost control of the bench which landed on his throat..I immediately dropped my phone and tried to help lift the bar. People around us saw what was happening and everyone rushed to help as well.. Unfortunately, my gym partner started to cough up blood &amp; it got pretty bad..

Reddit, I'm a fucking idiot.. I fucked up so bad that I don't know what to do with myself.. Currently at the hospital with his family and he's getting an emergency surgery. All I know right now is that he's been in surgery for the past 6 hours and counting.. 

TL;DR: Gym partner and I went ham on bench press. Forgot to spot my gym partner because I received a snapchat video from a girl that I met on Tinder..I also forgot to respond to the girl so looks like I'm done with her.. 


MAJOR UPDATE** The family &amp; I spoke with the doctors &amp; this is what happened. A piece of his larynx was damaged along with a minor fracture? Couldn’t really understand everything that the doctor said but my friend will survive &amp; insurance will cover the medical cost. I hope everyone can take away some valuable lesson from this incident. I’m deleting snapchat, never bringing a phone to the gym, and ALWAYS, respecting the bro code. I am genuinely sorry about what happened and I hope my friend will forgive me.  Ultimately, the surgery went really well.

Minor update* Just got home and did not expect this to blow up like this.. Like I said, yes I messed up. I know what I did wrong but the only I can do is pray for a speedy recovery. I'll be visiting him tonight after dinner and keep everyone posted. "
"TIFU because I made my boss think I was suicidal


I was at work. I was bored and tired and waiting for a client to call (dropping off a package) and I was typing random stuff into Google to see what the auto-suggestions were. I typed ""I'm tired"" and looked at the drop down list, selecting the first item just as the phone rang. I ran downstairs to get the package and then came back upstairs and went home without turning off my computer. I got a strange email an hour later from my boss:
&gt;Hey. Pardon me for asking, but you left a screen with a Google search up on the computer at the front desk, and I was worried.
&gt;Three things.
&gt;First, thank God you’re part of this team. Couldn’t do it without you. Everyone’s glad you’re here.
&gt;Second, if you ever want to talk about anything, including bad times and ugly shit, I’m here.
&gt;Third, I can’t promise you that life will be wonderful, but I can promise you that you can feel better about it. I didn’t believe it, but it’s true.

I emailed him telling him I was fine and asking what I had typed.

&gt;I'm tired of living

My boss is hyper-aware of depression and suicide and was scared for me. Now, all the senior attorneys are treating me with kid gloves.

Edit:  Thank you.  I was aware I have an awesome boss before this, but this made me appreciate him in a new way.  I think things are smoothed over now but we'll see.  "
"TIFU by picking my nose and ending up in the emergency room.


For the record, this is incredibly embarrassing and nobody outside of my immediate family knows about it. With that said, I have decided to post it on one of the most trafficked websites in the world. Before I begin with my story, I should add: this happened a few years ago [like most posts] when I was 18/19. I am 23 now.

It was a night like any other night: I was studying for a midterm the next day, with my nose in my books like the Hunchback of Notre Dam. Coinciding with allergy season [because studying is not miserable enough on its own], I feel my nose blocked internally with mucus and snot, sort of like when mountain towns are effectively overrun by snow.

What was I to do ? I tried using my finger as a sort of shovel, but the humidity made the contents of my nose dry and hard, like those crusty rocks inside caves. My finger was not doing any good so I decided to use the end of my mechanical pencil [https://www.amazon.com/BIC-Atlantis-Mechanical-Refillable-Pencils/dp/B000V7PBYM] to pry it out. Whilst doing so, the cap covering the eraser became dislodged, firmly implanting itself in my nasal cavity. 

My reaction, you ask ? I panic. I try to pick it out but I end up pushing it up further. Probably not the best solution in retrospect. I wake up my parents and my father grabbed a pair of pliers and tried to pull it out. Nothing doing.

So, where does that leave me ? Am I forever destined to have a pencil cap lodged in my nose ? Modern medicine suggests no. This is my cheeky way of saying I wound up going to the emergency room. I explained my dilemma to the nurse, who asked where my little brother was, because what adult would legitimately have this happen to them, right ? After five hours of waiting, the doctor walked into the room, with widened eyes [he probably skimmed the file and assumed it was a child, not a man] but asked no questions. 

A quick push of a tube of compressed air into the clear nasal canal and the pen cap shot out. My nasal canal has not had an object lodged in it since.

I will pretend that caps on pencils and pens are required to have holes precisely for this purpose and therefore I am within the norm. Nobody tell me differently.

TLDR: I was studying, picked my nose with the end of my mechanical pencil, dislodging the eraser cap and clogging my nasal canal. I ended up going to the emergency room and having a tube of compressed air put up my nose to shoot the pencil cap out. It worked.

EDIT: Front page of Reddit ! This almost makes up for this whole ordeal. Almost."
"TIFU by sleepily thinking that the angel in my tattoo was shedding feathers.


This just happened about an hour ago, and now I'm wide awake...

Backstory: got a tattoo of an angel falling from heaven a few days ago. It's pretty big and covers about half my back, which means that applying ointment/lotion to it is super tricky without assistance.

Woke up and had to pee, and while I was in the bathroom decided to apply some ointment to my tattoo since it was feeling a bit dry. I perched on the sink vanity and attempted to reach around my back to get at a tricky spot. As I smoothed my fingers over one wing, I felt something stick to my hand. I put it up close to my face and squinted (I'm half blind and was still half asleep), and there it was: a single white feather, which then floated off my finger to the floor. 

I was instantly and illogically convinced that some sort of fucked up Black Swan moment was happening (again: half asleep) and leapt off of the counter to try to look at it in the mirror. I immediately lost my balance and went crashing ass-first into the bathtub. I also took the shower curtain and quite a few bottles of shampoo/body wash with me, which made a nice, lovely crashing noise that echoed through the whole house. Boyfriend jumped up from a dead sleep and came running into the bathroom clutching the Glock from the nightstand, and our Husky started howling bloody murder outside the door because she probably thought I was dead.

Once I stopped seeing stars and tried to explain the situation to my relieved but slightly grumpy boyfriend, it occurred to me: we have a down feather pillow, and one of them must have escaped and gotten stuck to my ointment covered back.

Good morning to us...

TL;DR: a feather got stuck to my new tattoo and I thought it was coming out of my back a la Black Swan, and accidentally woke up my whole house while freaking out about it.

Edit: wow! I definitely did not expect my silly story to reach front page territory. Thanks, guys! Just to clarify, yes I am American, no I do not live in a trailer park, my boyfriend keeps the clip separate from the Glock in the nightstand so when he checked the bathroom the gun was not loaded (clip was in his hand), and lastly, the whole reason we have a gun in our nightstand is because we actually did have a home intruder about eight months ago. When confronted the intruder's reaction was to try and hurt my dog, therefore we decided to move one of our guns to a safe but easily accessible location to protect ourselves and her. 

Edit 2: a lot of people have been asking me to post pictures, so here you go:

https://imgur.com/gallery/WxQew

I've only gone through one of several sessions--we're going to add a lot more color and add more detail to the body/wings (including fixing his ""strong hand""). I was going for the idea that it could be an angel and it could be Icarus.

Also, my boyfriend has informed me that I am an idiot and used the wrong language referring to the Glock--I meant the magazine, not clip. And this is why the gun lives on his side of the bed..."
"TIFU by shooting my friend in the head


Like the majority of tifu, this didn't happen today but actually a few years ago. It was the summer of 2012 and my best mate was round my house and my dad had gone out with my brother for the day. We thought it would be a fun idea to put some targets up in the field and shoot them with the air rifles from the scaffolding in my house. 

All was going great except that we hadn't put enough water in the milk cartons and they kept falling over every few hits. So every couple shots we had to put them back up, being extra careful to unload the guns before running in front. So after a couple times of putting them back up we started to get relaxed and instead of unloading the guns we began to point them away from the targets when one of us ran up.

 Now, the targets were about 30m away and the scaffolding was about head height, and the final time we went to put the targets up, we forgot to move the guns and had left one loaded. It was my mates turn to put the targets up and when he was almost there I panicked and noticed the guns and went to move them so my friend wasn't in the line of fire. As I slid the older gun across it fired, now this thing was a break-barrel rifle with a hunting trigger that would fire if you breathed too hard on it and being an air rifle, I didn't hear it as I was shouting to my mate. Suddenly he yelled, grabbed his head and took a knee. I ran over and asked what has happened and he said he'd been hit in the head by something, I started gently looking round the back of his head and found a small trickle of blood and followed it up to find a small hole on the lower left side of his neck. 

It was at this point I literally shit the bed.  I ran back to the house, grabbed the phone and called an ambulance, who also informed me that they'd have to send an armed response unit due to it being a firearms incident. I then called my dad who rushed home and arrived the same time as the ambulance who then called an air ambulance as they thought he may require a head scan in the hospital that's an hours drive away. 

The armed response unit then turned up,  some six feet odd blokes step out of the car and take me for a walk up the garden so that they can understand what happened. I was absolutely bricking it,  worried that my friend could die, I'd go to prison and that two lives had been ruined in one day.

Luckily my friend didn't need to go in the air ambulance and was then taken to hospital where they told him if the pellet was a couple inches to the right he'd have been paralysed from the neck down. Thankfully he's okay, I didn't go to prison and now we joke about it every so often, but since that day I haven't touched the gun again. 

TL;DR 15 year old me accidentally misfired gun, almost paralysed my friend and was escorted by armed police officers.

"TIFU by almost killing a guy with my nuts.


I'm a baker at a company with a strict labeling policy. I accidentally made a cookie with nuts instead of a cookie without. Since the label said it didn't contain nuts, a man decided to eat one. Instantly had a reaction. Luckily he realized right away. "

"TIFU by thinking that my car wouldn't start when it was actually in Drive instead of Park.


Actually happened today. My car wouldn't crank, so I walked 4.5 miles home to get another car. I drove to my 'dead' car to get some stuff out of it and see if maybe I could get it to start again. Still nothing. 

As I was about to get out of the 'dead' car, I noticed that the gear shifter was on 'D' and not 'P' (short for Drive and Park)  I shifted to 'P,' and she started right up!

Next, I drove car #2 home and walked back another 4.5 miles to get the car that I originally  thought was busted. 

I got a good walk in, though. "
"TIFU by having a disastrous medical check up


(Reposted, reformatted, renamed with fuckups highlighted to make mod-friendly!)

This wasn't today, sometime ago in fact.

I got a letter in the post telling me to go for a medical checkup for my life insurance. ""No worries"" said I, munching down on my breakfast bacon butty ""I am a picture of bloody health"". The old ball-and-chain muttered something under her breath which I didn't quite catch - it was either ""fat bastard"" or ""fit barsteward"" but she wouldn't repeat it. I'll go with the barsteward one because I have been known to frequent drinking establishments from time to time but also, memorably, did a press up as a Christmas party trick once. Just the one, mind you, don't want to end up looking like that robot fella, wozisname, Arnold... you know the bloke that whoopsed the hired help and then became a big shot politician. Yeah, that's the fella.

So anyway, I hopped in the ute the next Saturday and headed into town to see the quack. The receptionist told me the doctor was running a bit late - some old fella had swallowed his dentures or something - so I ended up sitting around in the waiting room for about an hour and a half flicking through old copies of Reader's Digest, Horse &amp; Country and Farmers Weekly.

Now, at some point, my guts got sick and tired of waiting around and started fidgeting - rapidly breaking down the mince and cheese pie I'd had for breakfast on the way into town. Mate, traffic was getting seriously backed up at the motorway exit, if you know what I mean. So, I'm sitting there thinking to myself ""Cripes, I’ll have to hold myself down for this one"" and working out a plausible excuse to go and walk around in the car park for a few minutes when the receptionist called me to see the doctor. There was no escape so I did the old reverse swallowing trick is well-known to fellas like me who are prone to the odd bumburp here and there.

Now at this point, I'd just like to describe my doctor. Most doctors are bloody old, smell of Old Spice and piss, and partial to a power nap. Usually these happen while you're describing your symptoms and you end up with a leg cast to treat your hay fever or eye drops for your chapped udders... in small towns doctors can double up as vets, by the way.

Yeah, so our new doctor is not like this at all. She is in her thirties and pretty in a sort of Dr-Quinn-Medicine-Woman kind of way. She's been bloody awesome for the district health levels because there seems to be a lot more bathing and hairbrushing and suchlike amongst the lads, and the fellas now drag the kids off to the doc at the slightest sniffle. Oh and she's bloody posh: you know that ""I drive a Volvo and get someone else to sweep the chook shit of my porch for me"" kind of posh.

So I went into the consulting room and the doctor asked if I'd like a fella to perform the exam. ""Odd"" I thought but anyway, I wouldn't want Mick the orderly there to get all involved - he'd spend an hour talking footy and I've got bloody fences to mend! So I said no.
So we did the pulse thing, and the ears, eyes, throat thing, blow in this tube, stand on the scale, blah-de-blah-de-blah. Then she asked if I would undress to my underwear and lie on the bench as she needed to check for hernias and a testicular cancer.

O-kay.

Things began to get very tricky as she was doing her checks extremely thoroughly - I was frantically trying to sing the national anthem backwards to myself whilst mentally yelling at my downstairs ""DON'T YOU BLOODY MOVE!"". Let’s just say I ignored myself. Embarrassed as, I tried to bluster through an explanation she just gave me an ""I've seen it all before don't you worry"" smile, patted my on my shoulder and then said that she needed to do a prostate exam. I would need to lower my briefs and lie on my side. ""Odd"" I thought again but only briefly as I was trying to tuck my errant old fella away out of sight.

Now at this point, I would like to make a serious complaint about the education system of the seventies and eighties. No-one explained enough about the prostate when you're at school. Most blokes don't know what it is, let alone where it is or how it’s checked. All we know is its in the section of the school textbook where there are pictures of naked people that other students over the years have decorated with little spectacles and moustaches, arrows, people's names and suchlike.

So I was lying there still smarting from embarrassment when suddenly it felt like the doctor rammed a log of firewood up my nethers. ""A bit taken aback"" is probably the politest way of describing my reaction but she persisted, rummaging around like Santa searching his grotto for a present and I swear at one point she might have been in up to her bloody elbow. If this wasn't enough, the mince and cheese pie and my over-active metabolism came back to haunt me. I farted long and hard and, my holy fuck, it smelled like it came from the deepest depth of Satan's own backside. I can quite comfortably say that the embarrassment of becoming sexually aroused during a hernia and testicular exam pales into insignificance when you fart in a doctors face.
So, needless to say, I haven't been back to the Doctor for a year and a half. My missus says the doctor often asks after me and I suspect there's been a bit of a breach of doctor/patient confidence because she always sniggers when she tells me this. Oh, and I saw the receptionist in the supermarket a month after the exam and she was laughing uncontrollably and pretending she had read something amusing on the back of a cereal packet. Personally, I’ve never seen anything on a cornflakes box that is THAT funny so she must know too.

This is why I hate insurance salesman - if it wasn't for them I'd still be mates with my doctor.

TL;DR TIFU by farting during a prostate exam

Edit: So to answer a bunch of things...

• 'Cheers' to those who said they enjoyed reading this pile of dung. 'Fair enough' to those who called it a festering heap of shite. 'Couldn't have put it better myself' to those who said I talked for ages, said very little, was unentertaining, and had the writing ability of a high school eejit. If you thought it was rubbish, down vote the hell out of it, democracy is a beautiful thing. 

• I'm an old fella and old farts like us ramble. On purpose. Mostly because it is annoying but also because it's habit after decades of pre-Internet tale-swapping in pubs. It is what it is... down vote the hell out of it.

• Is it true? Yes. Is it embellished, over the top, and flowered up? Oh fuck yes! Is farting on a doctor really a fuck up? Maybe not for her. Either way, doe vote the hell out of this turd if you think it is shit.

• Happened in a little town in Essex when I was over there for ten years or so. Us colonials tend to travel a bit before settling down to shagging sheep and getting tattooed (or whatever anyone thinks is normal of Kiwis)!

• I encourage you again to down vote this spew-laden shit-post. I just enjoyed writing it down. 

Edit 2: Thank you things...

A big cheers to coolaccount2 (whose user name understates how awesome he actually is - good on yer mate) who encouraged me to kill myself for crimes against writing and being a shit stain upon the world. Look, I love your passion and agree that the world could do with fewer shit stains upon it but I couldn't top myself before killing every pair of undies that I own for being guilty too. 

Oh and fella who coined the phrase 'overwrought maturbatory prose', I love that! Cheers for a great chuckle. Or snigger, which someone told me is an unacceptable word. 

And anyone who had a laugh at a really stupid story, I'd have a beer with you any time. 

Edit 3: Today I learned that putting the TL;DR at the top and adding the words 'long as shitpost' to it would be wise if I ever try this again :-) 

Also thanks again to coolaccount2 who's continued advice on preventing further abuse of the written word by me shrugging off this mortal wozisname has been insightful and entertaining. I did Google your suggestion and yeah, nah. Thank for your help mate.
