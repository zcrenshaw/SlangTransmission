"TIFU bu almost jacking myself off to death


Ok so this one happened a few weeks ago now, but it's permanently burned into my brain, So I have an inbuilt defibrillator, that will monitor my heartbeat and shock me if my heartrate raises above 180 BPM, and it plays an important role in my tale.

so, it's 3am and I feel like shit, really bad pain in my lower abdomen, at this point everyone else in my family has gone to bed, so after about 3 hours of suffering, I say fuck it. and decide to go have a shower. and it relieves the pain, though, because I was alone, in the shower, with no-one else awake, I say fuck it, may's well jerk off. and I'm going along and.

BOOM

 I black out. I come to, Scream for my mother (at first I thought I was having a stroke, oh the irony).
Turns out the combo of jackin' it and hot water bought my heart rate up to 217!

BOOM

I black out a 2nd time. my mother rushes into the bathroom and sees me with a raging boner. 

BOOM

I black out once more.
and collapse in the shower.


 my mother wakes me up, and calms me down (turns out being electrocuted tends to increase your heartrate) , as I get continually shocked. and I end up in the ER a 4AM in the morning, having to explain, to my own mother, and 3 female nurses, why my heartrate was so high at 3AM in the shower.



I will never live this down."
"TIFU by playing GTA V with my 3 year old


This was a few days ago.  My son was down for his nap. My wife works 3rd shift, so she was a asleep.   Figured I had an hour to play some Grand Theft Auto.  Soon after, my son woke up and wanted to watch me play the game.  I figured no harm for a few minutes, since I was just going to do races, or other non-violent things, with the sound off. 

Driving to wherever I was going, he yelled at me because I didn't stop for the red lights.  I indulged him for a little bit until I got to one of the delivery missions that are timed.  Didn't stop for the lights on that particular one.  He became visibly upset on the verge of tears.  I decided that it was probably best to stop playing.  That's when the meltdown happened.  It woke my wife up, so she's upset and can't go back to sleep.  So I dealt with a grouchy wife and an inconsolable 3 year old that kept pointing out my driving mistake.  Now my son notifies me of every light while we're actually driving and gives me directions on what to do.  Every. Single. One.  Yellow lights are the worst. 

TL;DR My son got upset because I didn't stop for the red lights in GTA V.  A meltdown ensued and woke up my 3rd shift wife while she was trying to sleep from working the night before. "
"Tifu by not calling out of work


Woke up with that feeling of ugh I don't wanna go to work. I'ma call in. Nah better not this is the short week I gotta go. So I got up and went to work against my will. 

I work as an assistant mechanic in an industrial setting and sometimes required to work on a 100 ton press. My line lead and I were working on said press clearing a material jam and were almost finished, when we both noticed some debris in the die (dye maybe idk). He used an air nozzle in an attempt to blow out the debris, he was unsuccessful as I could still see it. (Insert fuck up here) I reached my hand into the press to show him where the debris was. He never fires this thing without calling clear or fire in the hole. Well today he did. He pushed the buttons, it came down, my hand was still there. Initially there was no pain, more of a super wtf moment. Luckily when I yelled at him he released the buttons and it stopped before completing it's cycle and he was able to reverse the press. Got my hand out and just held it til I got to ER. Had to have my left ring finger removed. It sucks. But it could've been a whole lot worse, it could have been my entire hand. 


For those wanting to see my hand now. http://imgur.com/KVgL9ob (nsfl)  This happened Oct 2 2016

Update: for those of saying to lawyer up, I wasn't going to at first, but in light of other information I've received from the co worker involved I'm going to consult with one. As far as time lost, there isn't any. They left me on the clock that night and I was out for 2 days, which was covered by vacation time because of how wc laws work. I'll be returning to work Sunday. Under doctor orders of extreme light duty. 

Non dominant hand thankfully. 

Regarding the loto procedure it's considered impractical for what was being done for a couple reasons. Supervisions main concern is down time, mechanically speaking it's not possible to do a raw material change with the machine powered down and no air flow. Most of the supervision have never worked as a mechanic, so they default to downtime being the reason for impracticality. 

Talked to wc adjuster, everything will be covered including the 2 days I had to use PTO for. 

First day at therapy. Bandages off.

Doctor says everything thing is looking well considering its only been 5 days and that it's healing fine. Movement is good in other fingers as well for this point. 

Tl;dr went to work, did something dumb, trusted another human, lost finger.

"TIFU by underestimating the stupidity of multiple people


Background info: There was a running joke in my schools that I would always be elected to be the Vice-President of student council for my year and bets would be taken on how long it took until I got kicked out for bad behavior.  This started in 5th grade and went all the way until my senior year.  In case people are curious, my ""terms"" ran from literally seconds to about 2 months.  Anyway, this post is from my junior year.

So junior year rolls around and it's time for student council elections.  By now everyone knows I'm going to be elected but because it was fun I still campaigned.  This years campaign consisted of me ""paying"" people to vote for me.  Now this ""money"" I was handing out to people was a black and white print out of a hundred dollar bill with my face badly pasted on using MS Paint.  They were about 50% bigger than a regular bill and also only printed on one side.  Anyway, about 3 days after the election I'm going through the lunch line and I find one of these ""bills"" in my pocket so being a smartass I hand it to the lunch lady at the register fully expecting her to call me an idiot and ask for real money.  Now, the way my schools system worked was you could type in a PIN and electronically charge your lunch to your account.  If you wanted to add money to your account you just gave it to the lunch lady and she would add it.  

So I hand this obviously fake hundred dollar bill to the lunch lady and she asks if I want to put my change on my account.  I sort of stare at her for a minute then say ""Sure"" figuring that she'll realize what's going on when the bill doesn't fit in the compartment in the register.  Nope.  She credits my account and sends me packing.  I think whatever, someone will catch the mistake later in the day and we'll all have a laugh. 

False.

2 days later the assistant principal comes to my 3rd period class flanked by two (2) State Troopers and hauls me out of there. Handcuffs and everything.  It turns out this ""counterfeit"" bill I was passing off made it all the way to the bank for deposit before someone finally said ""Duuurrrrrrr... why is this bill so much bigger and blacker and whiter and one sideder than the other bills?""  Bear in mind at least 3 people other than the lunch lady had touched it and counted it by this time.  

Now, apparently no one had shown the fake bill to the cops so as soon as they saw it they laughed and un-cuffed me.  They told the assistant principal that they were not interested in pursuing this matter any further and that there was absolutely no reason that bill should have ever been mistaken for counterfeit money.  

So the outcome was in school suspension for 3 days, I wasn't allowed to play in the next football game, a huge boost in my street cred for getting taken out of class in handcuffs (I had to start wearing safety glasses to protect my eyes from all the soaking wet panties being thrown at me (I kid)) and obviously I was removed from student council.  My second shortest term.

TL;DR Gave an over-sized monochromatic single sided hundred dollar bill with my face on it to a lunch lady. Lunch lady took it as real cash.  Cue oblivious people being oblivious.  Taken out of class by cops for being a criminal mastermind running a counterfeit operation.

Edit 1: Holy hell this blew up! Also, for some clarification; No, the lunch lady was not disabled. She was just a regular lady who I'm assuming just had zero fucks to give.  We were friendly and had a good laugh afterwards.  I got in school suspension I'm assuming because the assistant principal didn't want to look dumb.  Which really only made him look worse.  Finally, I couldn't find it in my yearbook but I did manage to find one of the originals being used as a bookmark in the yearbook.  So here it is, along with a 100% legal $10 bill for reference.

(Hello darkness my old friend...)

Edit 2:  I didn't bank one the astute eyes of reddit.  I wanted to make myself sound a little older so I pushed back the dates of my FU.  It was a 2006A series hundred dollar bill.  I was a freshman in 2007.  I have brought shame upon my ancestors.

Edit 3: Imgur has no chill so I'm taking down the picture.  We're talking reporting to the Secret Service and shit.  If anyone wants it let me know and I'll figure something else out.

Edit 3.5: Some clarification. I put the picture up on imgur earlier and had multiple people (on imgur) saying they were going to be reporting it. Hence, imgur having no chill.  I'm trying to upload elsewhere but I'm on a work computer so I'm limited.  Also, there's GOLD in my hills! I feel like the luckiest boy in the whole world!

Hopefully reddit has more chill. If not, it'll be gone quick so hurry!"
"TIFU by blowing on my cat's butthole


This happened a few hours ago and I've been in a state of shock and disgust ever since. 

Okay, so I had just finished reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child when my cat jumped onto my bed and greets me. So I start petting her and she climbs on me and starts purring and kneading me when she turns around and presents me with her anus, tail held high and proud. I had heard that this, in cat language, was like a handshake and meant she wanted me to sniff her butthole in greeting. Well, that wasn't going to happen and I had remembered reading on Reddit that if you lightly blow on your cat's bootyhole this could 'simulate' you sniffing it. So I did. Bad idea. She proceeded to spray liquid shit directly onto my face.

"TIFU by getting my feet stuck in a bucket of cement.


The mob were not involved. Technically this happened a few years ago but thought it was good enough to share.
I was working on a short film and needed a plaster mold of my feet, so of course I thought ""well why not"" and shoved my feet right into a bucket full of wet cement. Other than the heat of the chemical reaction between the water and the dry cement, everything seemed fine. So about 20 minutes later I tried taking my feet out, and long story short the fire brigade were called. They tokyo drifted down my drive and burst through my door. As each fireman came through the door they broke down into tears of laughter, before long they were all standing round me taking photos.

TL;DR - Needed plaster mold of feet, feet stuck, fire brigade called, they all started taking photos of me."
"TIFU by doing enemas with my girlfriend


Yesterday my girlfriend and I somehow decided that we both wanted to see what having a clean colon feels like. We went to Walmart to pick up an enema kit which thankfully looks like a hot water bottle. 

When we got home I decided she would go first. All goes well for her and she gets to the waiting stage. Apparently you have to hold in the water for 10-20 mins. 

Being an impatient person, I decided to start filling up as soon as she started waiting. All shit breaks loose for me at this point. The second I pulled out to tube after finishing the bag I immediately had to release the water. She raced me to the toilet because when I started scrambling after pulling out the nozzle she laughed which triggered her poop senses. She got 3/4 the way over the toilet and absolutely errupted. I was on the verge of crying because I knew I'd never make it to the upstairs washroom... As I'm looking at the sink she leans over and rips the shower door open. ""SHOWER!!"" I threw all of my shampoo and body wash out the door and turned my ass towards the corner and sprayed the water out like a skunk. A tiny turd flew out.. At this point were dying of laughter, embarrassment and disgust. 

TIFU and did a couples enema and ended up with fewer toilets than spraying assholes. 


This post was removed earlier this week because of rule 4.

Thanks everyone for laughing at this fuck up! To clarify, we were in the bathroom on the floor and had a 3 foot race to the toilet. She won but I got to shit in a shower so who really won. "
"TIFU by playfully setting a cardboard box on my toddler son's head.


This was actually last Friday, but it's had lasting effects.

My son (1.5 years) was exceptionally grumpy that evening. Everything I did was wrong or pissed him off or caused a giant meltdown. About an hour before bedtime, he was playing with a small cardboard box he's had for awhile. He kept handing it to me, and I was sick of him doing so, so I playfully set the box on his head. He immediately grabbed it, screamed ""NO!!!!"" and threw the box off his head, hitting my face. The corner of the box hit right below my eye, and it immediately swelled shut and turned blue/purple. I swear I was blind for a few minutes.

The next day we were scheduled to have family pictures. By then it had turned a lovely shade of dark purple and maroon. Thank goodness for photoshop.

Sunday was our anniversary, which it had then turned completely black, and I kept getting funny looks from every stranger I came in contact with. I constantly felt the need to explain that my black eye was from my son, not my husband. But isn't that horrible?

And tomorrow, I have to attend my husband's big fancy gala party for work, and this black eye has STILL not subsided. 

Good times. Toddlers are the best.

Edit: words.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the awesome replies, folks.. especially the makeup tips! But the amount of people telling me to beat my child for what he did is a little disturbing. He's one step up from a baby. He didn't throw the box at me to purposely hurt me. He just didn't want it on his head.

Edit 3: I'm a mom."

"TIFU By giving a stranger 20 dollars for gas money


I'm 17 working at a grocery store from 5-10. I got off at 10 and started walking across the empty parking to my truck. As soon as I got in some guy pulls out of nowhere and pulls in behind my truck. 

He gets out and I roll down my window to see what he wants. Said he needed gas money and was running on nothing. He offered me 2 cds and 2 5hour energies for just a couple bucks to fill his car up. Since there was a gas station right in the same parking lot I figured I'd give him a little. It turned out that all the cash I had was a 20 dollar bill. 

He had a somewhat new car and was decently dressed so me being the gullible teenager that I am handed him the 20 and denied the cds and 5hour energy. He shook my hand and peeled out driving past not one but two gastations I sat there dumbfounded realizing the mistake I made.


Edit: Thanks for the uplifting words guys! I realize that I lost 20 bucks , but I also realized that it could have been much worse than me losing money. Thanks for the tips on how to avoid these things I will be more cautious moving foward.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments and up votes! Its good to know I'm not the only one to fall for this. Wish yall all a good day!"
"TIFU by tearing my girlfriend's cervix


So this quite unpleasant situation that happened last night.  No before you ask this isn't a story about how I have such a massive penis I somehow punctured by gf's cervix although admittedly it's not much better.

To begin you have to understand an important dynamic between my gf and I.  We're into bdsm.  Ok that was easy.  Her biggest kink is insertions, she loves being filled up huge.  So we're going through our scene, she's tied up to a chair mounted on a big ole buttplug while gagging on a dildo-gag.  I've got a nice little vibrator against her clit having a great time really.

Well then things take a turn.  We've experimented with using this [ pump dildo](http://imgur.com/dr1ZmCS) before, which was a lot of fun, and we've been longstanding [users of this guy too](http://imgur.com/2FpEiSe) (B not A).  For the first time we thought hey let's use them at the same time.  Start off and she's loving it, like she's really into it.  Screaming through the gag, spittle flying out the sides, etc.  She's losing it and losing it, so I pull out the gag so I can hear her.  I ask her if she wants to keep going and she just nods.  At this point I notice how fast she's breathing so I stop pumping her up and give her a minute to catch her breath.  I ask her a couple times and we have a quick conversation where she says she wants to finish the scene and she's loving it, and so on and on.  So I say ok and we go for the finish.

Well after about two pumps I see the blood.  **A lot of blood**.  I very calmly inform her we've got a bit of an issue and have to end the scene, while internally about to faint from the sight before me.  It's not the blood itself it's the fact the blood is coming out of her vagina like at torrent.  I quickly untie her, throw on a pair of panties and sweatpants and carry her to the car.  I drive straight to the hospital and about halfway there the endorphins run out and she starts complaining of pain.  I'm sweating fucking bullets (she's reassuring me she's not blaming me or mad or anything) thinking I literally just broke my gf. 

We get her in to the ER and they immediately put her down on her side, a bag of blood and some pain medication.  She's really hurting by this point and I'm trying to help and be supportive while dying rapidly on the inside.  If glares shot daggers I'd have been a pincushion from all the nurses who think idk I somehow beat my gf's cervix.  Doctors finally arrive, take a look and agree yep she tore her cervix.  Well I tore her cervix but she keeps saying it's not my fault, doesn't make me feel any less guilty.  They then of _course_ had to cauterize the tear.  My mind conjured images of a blowtorch going into my gf's vagina but I was assured it would be some sort of fast-acting gel that would still burn like a motherfucker but at least close the wound.  So they go ahead and give her a sedative and perform the operation while I sit out in the waiting room struggling to figure out what to tell her relatives.  

She was in a lot of pain when she got out, and was nauseous from the pain medicine to the point she couldn't walk.  And she was catheter'd because she obviously can't use those muscles.  So they kept her overnight and got released this morning.  Of course I have a huge meeting today I couldn't miss so I had to leave for work straight from the hospital, had a friend of ours bring me my work clothes and stay with my gf.  Guilt ate me alive so I came home from work, and have been pampering her all afternoon until she took another dosage of painkillers and passed out on the couch.  

What's the lesson kids?  *Know the limits of your gf's cooch before ya stick things in*.

**TL;DR: Playing real kinky with my gf and ended up tearing her cervix with a spiked dildo**

Edit: Alright I was unclear.  I threw panties _on her_ not me.  Jesus guys I can't keep making the ironic ""we're not into that weird shit"" joke over and over again.

edit2: oh you fucks just had to gild me didn't you.  I DON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER REDDIT!

edit3: so she woke up, read these comments and laughed her butt off which I'm taking as a good sign for recovery.   We're headed off to bed now guys, see ya in the morning.

edit4: I hope y'all are happy.  You ~~double~~ quadrouple gilded a post about making a girl bleed out her vagina.  Never change reddit."
"TIFU by bringing snacks in to the theater.


So this actually happened about 4 hours ago. My friends and I went to see Snowden (which was fairly good), but being the cheap bastards we were, we went to the save-on to buy snacks, which was ironic because I ended up spending $16, mostly on pistachios, which is relevant to the story. The first 10 minutes are EXTREMELY quiet, so I was trying to open my bag of pistachios as inconspicuously as possible, but it was proving difficult. I mustered up a tiny bit more gusto and the bag exploded and SHOWERED the floor and the seats in front of me (which, thankfully, no one was sitting in), completely breaking the silence. I can still remember the exact sound of hundreds of shells bouncing off seats and the hard floor. My girlfriend was super embarrassed, and my friends were dying trying to contain their laughter. What happened didn't even register for a few seconds and I just stood there, wide-eyed, trying to comprehend the situation. I picked as many as I could off the floor in the darkness, but I know there was still at least a hundred in the aisle in front of me. If somehow the theater worker is reading this, I am so goddamn sorry I was that guy.

Edit: obligatory RIP inbox"
"TIFU eating free craigslist meat


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My house has three large dogs, and kibble gets expensive. I love perusing craigslist for free shit. It's hunting season right now and someone said they were getting rid of old, freezer burnt meat. I thought, sweet, dog food. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I pick it up, take it home, open it up and it all looks great. Give the dogs a couple pounds of elk burger and call it a day. What fucked us is this wasn't just burger meat, there were awesome antelope, elk, and deer steaks. We three are all suckers for steak so next thing you know we're cooking up steaks, and they're delicious. We might have been ok but we all prefer our steaks very rare.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I pooped water for five-six days, once every ten minutes or so. I've never been so sick in my life. My roommate found me in the shower crying and shitting because I couldn't go long enough to make it through the shower. The only plus to this experience was that I felt like I should have went to the doctor but didn't (no health insurance) BUT NOW I DO and the experience made me realize that accidents happen (sometimes in your pants)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This happened a few weeks ago but I didn't think of posting it until I read about the enema date. 

TL;DR Got craigslist meat, fed it to me and my dogs, got sick, shat liquid.

Edit: Someone asked the important question about how the dogs did. Dog kind again proved to be superior to the weak human being. All that time eating cow poop really paid off for their immune system. 
 
Edit: I added that I now have health insurance. 

Edit: I usually hate when people put up edits that their post blew up, but people seem very worried about a lot of things. Most importantly [the dogs are doing pretty fricking awesome since](http://imgur.com/a/qLQu4) (they weren't only living off of meat, it was supplemented with kibble) and while I appreciate you dog tips; I'm pretty sure that living on a farm and never being alone or in a crate is better than your dogs life of 8 hours a day in a crate eating premium kibble. 

Second, I said a few weeks but looking back on it it was a few months ago, I have not had any symptoms of anything since. I'm currently living a very happy healthy, craigslist meat-free lifestyle.

LASTLY. So is my home the only place where people commonly give away and accept craigslist meat? This is pretty SOP around hunting season to give away meat, accept it, and feed it to your dogs. Obviously I'm a big ol retard for eating it myself, but seeing the dog's health improvement of a meat/kibble diet, I would probably accept the meat again and just not personally consume any. "
"TIFU by spilling two liters of piss in my bag.


So I have a problem with my liver, they don't know what it is yet so I'm doing a lot of tests.
One of them was a 24 hour urine collection, which means I had to pee is a jar for 24 hours and then give it back to the lab for analysis.
I drink a lot, so after 24 hours I had a good gallon of piss I took everywhere.

When it was finally time to take the jar back I put it in my bag because I didn't want to walk around holding a clear jar full of piss, I thought it was a good idea. It wasn't.

I was walking to the lab, and suddenly i feel water running down my legs. ""What could this be?"" I wondered for a few seconds, then it hit me. My legs and lower back were covered in my own piss.
Apparently the jar tilted, spilling half its contents in my bag.

I ran to the lab, and gave what was left to the guy there and ran back out.

Today cost me a bag, two books and a phone charger. It was not a good day.

**Edit** a lot of you are asking if I had a lid on it. I did. In fact it wasn't even my jar, the lab gave me like a plastic pitcher thing that came with a lid, I thought it would be at least to some degree water tight. It was not. Ohh also I had to go straight to work, didn't have time to shower and I serve food.

**Edit 2** just to clarify, it spilled on the way to the lab, I was not walking around with it. And about the job, I know it's gross, but I work solo shifts in a place that's really understaffed so I could not cancel or be late on such short notice, I was supposed to open the place. Btw I quit working there, it was my last shift."
