"Winners of Best Of 2016!!


Okay, so I've tallied up the votes and it's time to reveal the winners of the Best Of thread. Let's keep this short and sweet and give the winners their recognition!

**Most Brutal:** u/SkeletorOnCrack wins with this as the chosen link - https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/46tru1/z/d07t3a0

**Best OP Comeback:** u/RunningWalkman with [this beautiful headshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/5f316n/z/dahnptw)

**Most Underrated:** It was the top comment in the thread, but [this gem](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/595m1t/i_have_cerebral_palsy_and_im_gay_i_also_joined/d95ulj5/)  from u/SillyOperator could've done much better than it did.

**Best Roastee:** /u/mealzonwheelz90 rolled right past the competition with his replies, found [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/595m1t/i_have_cerebral_palsy_and_im_gay_i_also_joined/)

**Best Male Roast:** u/phroxen takes home the gold for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4c8qak/roast_me_up_scotty/d1g0msp/) verbal desctruction.

**Most Original Roast:** u/bumcubble delighted us all when he gave us a [rap roast](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/51lpqp/rapper_and_hypebeast_says_hes_unroastable/d7cwoh9)

**Best Group Roast:** [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/5guv6e/roast_me_the_virgin_squad/) by u/kajnbagoat - he nominated himself, a bold move that paid off.

**Funniest Roast:** It had to be tough to dig through lots of good roasts to find this one, but u/elysiaxx hit too close to home with his Roast of [Ken Bone](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/5dke49/im_ken_bone_roast_me_you_know_you_want_to/da5alcp/)

**Best Female Roast:** Roastception with this one, which handily took the top spot in its category. u/DaRubberduckey wins with [his or her own roast](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4sbxhc/i_am_16_in_marching_band_and_have_autism_and_add/)

And last but not least, a best roaster of the year was voted on.
