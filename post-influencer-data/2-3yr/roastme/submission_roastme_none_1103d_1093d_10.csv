LordTaikun - [you look like the kind of guy who’s “totally a real rapper” because your sound cloud has 60 followers and you sold 5 copies of a mix tape. I bet you tell all your friends that you’re about to sign a record deal but “the label company is being a total pain in the ass about negotiations”. Oh, and stop trying to look like a thug, real cholos don’t reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/52no2n/you_want_to_win_gold_roast_the_mods/d7p8u52)

arseniccrazy - [That is the single least inviting photograph of a living person ever. You look as cheerful as someone who's about to have a colonoscopy. You know how soldiers have the 1000 yard stare? This is like the 1000 yard shrug.

Note: For the people about to say ""Wait why aren't the comments gilded then?"" We sent the gold directly to the user.

Congratulations to all our winners!

~~So here's the thing. We as a sub have a lot of gold credits leftover from ""various sources"".  We were thinking about what to do with them, and we threw out a couple ideas. The idea that won was, as is tradition, the least original one. We're having a mod roast, and we're going to gild the best comments.~~

~~Now because we're giving out gold, we're adding a few extra rules.~~

~~1. **One comment per person.** You may roast as many mods as you want, but include all the roasts in one comment to allow easier and fairer gilding.~~

~~2. **YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH OUR POST HISTORIES.** We have given you some facts to use as ammo against us, but if that isn't enough, you are welcome to go through our post histories to get more. This is actually already allowed for any roast, but we would like to remind you of that here so the roasts don't suck.~~

~~3. **The highest rated comments will not necessarily be the ones chosen to be gilded.** Each mod will choose their own favorite comment for themselves. We reserve every right to pick a comment that was downvoted 854 times.~~

~~Anyways, here we are in all of our ""glory"":~~
