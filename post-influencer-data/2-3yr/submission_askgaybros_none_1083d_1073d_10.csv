"Let this be a lesson to you all


Saturday and Sunday night I had unprotected sex with a beautiful man in his 20s. I topped him raw three times and he tried to top me raw but I didn't let him go all the way in (I don't like bottoming). We blew each other. Kissed. Cuddled. It was great. We light heartedly lectured one another on how we were idiots for not wearing condoms even though we were as certain as possible that we were both negative. 

The week starts and I message him telling him I'm feeling anxious about not wearing condoms so he goes to get tested at the clinic ""just in case and to alleviate any concern""

He called me two hours ago to tell me he tested positive at the clinic. This is 65 hours after we had sex the first time and just shy of PEPs 72 hour exposure window. 

I bolt to the clinic in a panic, swearing bullets and on the verge of tears. At the same time I feel for this beautiful inside and out man who just got diagnosed and called me to tell me to go to the clinic. 

I have just taken my first dose of pep. There is no guarantee that this medication will work. I feel like an asshole. ive had to take pep before in years past for reckless behavior similar but less risky than this. I'm an idiot. You never know. Do not have unprotected sex. Do not do it."
"How to Flirt !!


You're probably already giving a few signals when you're into someone, but they'll be subtle, and reacting differently to someone you're into definitely isn't the same as flirting either. Here's a brain dump of behaviours that are flirty or at least showing interest. Not all are as important, intense, risque, etc. as each other, which will be obvious.

I'll break it down into arbitrary categories:



**Touch:**
Touching anywhere can be actually construed as flirting -- the more unnecessary, the flirtier it is. Touching is usually far more flirty than your words or body language. More notable and obvious examples:

* Any sort of playful horse play -- punching/pushing shoulder, etc.
* Touching leg when displaying interest in the conversation
* Touching arm is the same but less intensified
* Legs accidentally touching under table, then not moving. Usually this escalates till it's pretty clear it's no longer an accident and is comfortable.
* Putting hand on guy's chest when listening, or in photos, almost like petting.
* Sitting on lap
* Tickling fights
* Leaning in on each other
* Pressing against the guy when the opportunity arises (e.g. doorways/comparing height/hugs)
* Comparing hand size, but touch
* Not withdrawing from the guy's touch. (Close distance in general)
* Hand on small of back 


**Body language:**

*Eyes*

* Eye fucking -- eye contact which definitely isn't accidental. Best from a distance which is too far to speak over.
* Alternatively, getting caught looking and looking away quickly / getting flustered / trying to hide it.
* Intense eye contact during conversation
* Intermittently looking at lips
* Increased blink rate (a general indication of some sort of mental pressure)

*General*

* Positioning yourself near the guy you're into (to hopefully induce a conversation -- guys will notice if they're into you too)
* Direction your body is facing. The more direct, the better.
* Laughing a lot and seeming happy/excited during conversation.
Nervousness
* Scratching hand/wrist.
* Cocking head, which displays interest (in general).
* Mirroring behaviour
* Wetting lips (anticipation of kissing)
* Making petulant back-and-forth faces against each other (e.g. sticking out tongue)
* Becoming flushed (relatively hard to fake)

* When sitting down, rubbing inside of thighs (Quite forward...)
* Rubbing thighs together (Even more forward. You want to fuck 
* Allow yourself to be talking together in relative isolation (i.e. no friends in your conversation).
* Putting hand over breast/chest while talking
* Touching neck
* Exposing neck
* Smiling suggestively, like in an inside joke in a conversation
* Encouraging sharing of drinks ""Here, take a taste""
* Exchanging items which will need to be recovered later/ensure future meeting, e.g. borrowing a lighter, or owing drinks.

*Verbal*

* Teasing in general. Challenging naturally allows you to assess each other's character.
* Pet names
* General flattery -- flattery of physical aspects is usually more flirty.
* General interest (i.e. interviewy type conversation. Not exciting but it still displays something)
* Exchanging contact details.
* Disagreeing but maintaining a happy vibe nonetheless.
* Asking what you're doing later
* Asking where you live
* Assuming he has a boyfriend
* Asking relationship status
* If the conversation dies, you try to reinitiate
* Offering to buy or asking for drinks.

* Double entendres (you don't need to be James Bond, or even make your own -- you can misconstrue the other's words and call the guy out as if it were deliberate, or it can just be subtext, e.g. talking about sleeping can hint things).
* Talking about sex and relationships
* Creating a 'we' relationship, e.g. we should get shots
* Doing favours.
* Kisses in text messages


I could literally go on for hours! But there's seriously room for creativity. Basically, touching and eye contact are excellent.

"FML


So a funny thing that happened today:

My best friend (who's straight) and I were in the car.  I was busy driving while he was talking.  Here's the convo:

Him: ""So, serious question...do I have a thick ass?"" (he does btw)

Me: ""ummm...""

*I pause for a bit, thinking about what to say without sounding too thirsty*

Me: ""Well..I mean..I definitely notice it. Maybe that's just me but I'm sure other people do to.""

Him: ""So even if I talk slowly you can still hear it?""

At that moment, I realized he said accent and not ass...fml lol."
"There is nothing wrong with waiting for the right person. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to take part in hookup culture.


And there's also nothing wrong with choosing to take part in hookup culture (please educate yourself about protecting your sexual health though!). There's nothing wrong with fucking anyone you want with consent if that's what feels right to you.  
  
However, I have been ridiculed, accused of being a ""slut shamer"" despite being incredibly pro-sex and pro-sexual health education, etc.  
  
There's this narrative that gay men slut shame one another and the issue isn't non-existent, but it's not as pervasive as some claim. What's been a far greater issue is the pressuring of men to be promiscuous against their wishes and to shame them when they aren't.  
  
As someone waiting to be in a committed relationship before having sex, I want to tell others that if you feel this is right for you and if you don't feel like hooking up is for you...do not be someone you aren't. There is nothing wrong with you and you aren't alone in feeling this way.  
  
And, of course, realize that our personal beliefs and the choices we make do not make us superior to those who do hook up a lot!  
  
I felt compelled to make this post after some recent comments made about me by some gay men. The fact that they didn't hurt me showed how much I've matured and how much more confident I've become in myself as I continue to grow older. I just wanted to share this wisdom here because many of you are in high school and college and may feel the pressures I felt to conform.  
  
Know that there is nothing wrong with you. "
"Boyfriend's cousin got robbed and her homophobic crazy aunt was here and unloaded on us. What a nightmare.


So my boyfriend's 18 year old cousin was in this robbery/assault situation. She was stupid enough to attack the thief and got beaten up as well as had her stuff taken. As he was the only family in town he went and picked her up from the police station and brought her here for the night. No problems here obviously he's just being a nice cousin. That's what I would have done had she been my cousin.

So at night we were all sleeping. She's taking the bed and I'm sleeping on the couch. The mom arrives at 3 am. Unexpectedly. She's ringing the bell continuously. I woke up and opened the door, she comes in and speaks so loud. She's on my face ""where's my daughter where's my daughter what have you done with her"". Yeah I ate her for dinner. I told her she's sleeping in the bedroom and she just goes in and wakes her up and wakes up my boyfriend too, her own nephew, and screaming at him why is he sharing the bed with her until she tells her that she asked him to because she was feeling a little scared. Now she's telling him just because he's gay doesn't mean he can prey on women! Called him a fag too. Said she always knew he wasn't a complete man. I mean what the fuck.

I then tell her that she needs to calm down we helped her daughter and she's insulting the person who dropped everything to go take care of his cousin and she tells me to mind my own business and know who my place. Then the cousin starts defending us telling her mum that we've been nothing but nice to her and she's being rude and she screams at her telling her to shut up and explain what happened. Now our flatmate and her boyfriend who have woken up from this all come out and ask what's going on and she screams at them to shut up too. And then my boyfriend tells her to get the fuck out of here and she takes her daughter's arm and tries to take her but she says she doesn't want to go with her. She tells her she feels safer here with us than with her and she kind of loses it and tells her if she really feels safer with a ladydude (referring to my BF) and mr fag (me) and Romeo and Juliette (our flat mates) than with her own mom and she says yes!

I just picked up the phone and pretended to call the cops and told them that we have an intruder in our property who doesn't leave and she gets scared and leaves.

Jesus Christ guys. 2 hours later I'm still in shock. I feel nothing but empathy for this poor girl. Growing up with that woman is worse than getting robbed every day.

"I'm[41m] worried that my son[17m] might be having an affair with my friend [48m].


Using a throwaway because my son is on reddit.  Someone said I should post here and ask you guys for advice.


 ""Michael"" and I met when we moved where we live now. He was one of the first neighbors who welcomed us to the neighborhood.  We've become quite good friends over the years and hang out a lot. I live with my wife and two sons and he lives with his wife but his kids have moved out. Our wives are friends as well so our families have spent a lot of time with each other.


I was helping him paint some outside furniture about a week ago and he seemed really distracted by his phone the whole time. I asked him who he was texting and he said it was just a co-worker. I've had a feeling he's been having an affair for a while now. He's often distracted by his phone and he doesn't seem very interested in his wife. I've never asked him about it because I felt like it's very personal and not really my business. 


After we've been painting for a while he goes inside to get us some drinks and I feel something buzzing next to my leg and I look down and his phone is in the grass and I can see who's texting him and it's my son. The screen shows the beginning of the text ""I couldn't really find...."". I thought it was weird but I didn't think much of it. Micheal comes back with a couple of beers and we keep painting. 





I didn't think much of it at first but I kept thinking about it and it just didn't make sense to me. Why would he lie about texting my son? And why would they be texting in the first place? I couldn't shake the feeling that something was up so when I got home I did something that I'm really not proud of but I looked through my sons phone while he was taking a shower. There was no texts between them on his phone and but I know that they've been texting so my son must've deleted them and that just made me more confused. 

Now me and my wife have been pretty sure our son is gay for a long time now and we talked about it a lot and decided to just let him come to terms with it on his own and make sure he knows we're pro LGBT+ rights and that we love him no matter what. I saw he had Grindr on his phone when I looked through it so that almost confirms it. 


There's a million things they could be texting about and there's a million reasons why they might not tell me about it but I just have a weird feeling so I went through my son's phone a couple of days later ( I know I shouldn't invade his privacy like that but I'm his father and it's my job to make sure he's not getting into to trouble.). I only found a few of texts between them from the nigth before.

My son: 7.00pm?

Micheal: Yeah. See you then ;)

My son: :)

The night before my son said he was going to a friends house but he obviously met Micheal and he wasn't home until around 11.00pm.

I know there might be a million explanations but it just seems off to me. The combination of suspecting Micheal of having an affair for a while now and my son most likely being gay and them meeting and texting in secret is just too much. Am I insane for thinking there might be someting going on between them? I haven't talked to my wife about it yet because I don't want to worry her but I need some advice on what to do now. I hate going through my sons phone and invading his privacy like that but I don't really know what else to do except for straight out asking them which would be extremely awkward and nothing would stop them from lying. 

The age of consent here is 16 so if there is anything going on they're not doing anything illegal and I don't care if my son is gay  but it would make me very upset if he's gotten involved with a married 48 year old that I consider to be a good friend of mine. 

**TL;DR:** My son and married neighbor has been texting and meeting in secret and I'm worried there might be something going on between them. What do I do now?"
"Your Mini-Guide to PrEP



There are often posts about PrEP and it seems like people are completely or partially confused about it. As a medical doctor, your posts have made me question my own knowledge. Now while I am an anesthesiologist and don't really deal with this on a daily basis, I like to have the most up to date knowledge on any subject. Luckily I also enjoy research so I went digging around for journal articles to make a comprehensive mini-guide to PrEP.

**1. Introduction**

New HIV infections remain a problem worldwide. In the US alone there are over 30,000 new infections in MSM (men who have sex with men) annually, especially in the young MSM and MSM of color populations. There is also a rise in other STDs, and syphilis specifically increased by almost 50% in MSM between 2010 and 2014. Rectal STDs increase the chance of HIV seroconversion by 2.7 times. The PROUD study found that 64% of men had been diagnosed with a STD in the previous year and 44% used drugs to reduce sexual inhibition. One study found that almost 50% of men have had unprotected sex in the past 3 months, and 8% have unprotected sex more than once a week. Groups that show a higher incidence of unprotected sex are young MSM and those in apparently monogamous relationships.

**2. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis**

The most commonly used drug is Truvada, a combination pill of two drugs - tenofovir and emtricitabine. The PROUD study showed that taking PrEP routinely reduced HIV infection rates by 86%, and the Ipergay study showed that infection rates were reduced by 86% in men who take Truvada before sex only. Other studies suggest that the protection may be much greater with only 2 men converting out of 657 in the PrEP Demonstration Project. PrEP users and physicians who prescribe PrEP are attempting to overcome a stigma potentiated by various individuals and even celebrities who have given rise to terms such as 'truvada whores' in people who wish to use PrEP. Studies of PrEP show such effectiveness that European and US medical advisory committees are attempting to urgently integrate it into regular protocols for HIV prevention. PrEP is free in many European countries and is part of several projects to accelerate its widespread use. Interest in PrEP among US MSM is very high, especially in men who are highly educated about HIV and PrEP and those who have regular unprotected sex.

**Official Indications for taking PrEP**

* MSM who engage in unprotected anal sex
* Individuals who take part in a HIV serodiscordant relationship
* Transgender individuals who take part in high risk activity
* Transactional sex workers
* Certain intravenous drug users
* Individuals who use stimulant drugs and take part in high risk behavior
* Individuals who have been diagnosed with an anogenital STD within the past year

**Dosing**

Daily dosing of Truvada leads to highly effective drug levels after one week. Rectal cells show high levels of Truvada after 7 doses with 94% protection. After stopping Truvada, drug levels persist but people who have engaged in high risk activity should continue to take it for another four weeks to protect themselves from lingering sources of infection. In the Ipergay study men used what is called demand-dosing and took 2 tablets 2-24h before sex, then one tablet 24 and 48h after sex. The average Ipergay participant used 16 pills per month, about half that of a regular doser. Intermittent dosing may be as effective as regular dosing but it is also likely that men who take intermittent doses (at least 15 pills per month) are more protected than men who occasionally take Truvada due to a quieter sex life. In other studies they found relatively good adherence with most men taking their pills regularly without missing a dose if they decided to take Truvada daily.

**Side Effects**

The most common side effects in the PROUD study were nausea, headache and sore joints. About 93% of men have some sort of mild side effect. About 14% of men get gastrointestinal complaints like diarrhea or cramps. 8% of participants found the side-effects difficult to deal with. Truvada is associated with a decrease in kidney function but it is non-progressive and reversible after stopping the drug (within 4-8w it is normal). About 18% of men experience these kidney changes. Doctors can draw blood to test kidney functions on a yearly basis. 17% of men get raised liver enzymes and these are also monitored, and Truvada does also not affect those who have active hepatitis negatively. For those of you who want natural kids one day, Truvada was found not to affect fertility in men. Truvada does lower your bone mineral density over time and there are concerns that it may lead to osteoporosis and easy fractures in your later life. This is still up for debate because long term data is lacking. One trial found that Truvada is about as safe as aspirin - however one should also appreciate that aspirin is an over the counter drug that leads to several potentially serious problems like gastric ulcers and bleeding, and therefore the trial is not saying that both are extremely safe but rather that both have occasional side effects.

**Resistance**

People are worried that Truvada will lead to resistance in anti-retroviral regimens for treating HIV infected patients. A study found that resistance is rare due to PrEP, is much more common in patients being treated for HIV, and that the benefits of PrEP far outweigh the dangers of resistance.

**Future PrEP**

Two drugs, Cabotagrevir and Rilpivirine are under investigation for injectable PrEP. Both have tremendously long half lives and can be given 3-monthly as a single shot. There are some minor problems being investigated in this area such as injection site pain and high volume. In a study of MSM in New York, 80% of respondents said that they would rather take an injectable than a pill.

**Summary**

* High risk practices and new HIV infections are high in many MSM communities.
* Other STDs are common in MSM and greatly increase the uptake of HIV.
* Truvada is profoundly effective as PrEP (upwards of 90% or more) but infections do still occur.
* Truvada can be given daily, or as a regimen prior to sex.
* There is a stigma around PrEP that needs to be addressed.
* Most medical authorities believe that PrEP should be widely available and encouraged in high risk populations.
* Mild side effects are common and serious side effects are rare.
* Kidney function may decrease and osteoporosis may be a long term issue with regular use.
* Drug resistance is not an issue.
* Injectable PrEP is on the horizon.

Guys I really hope someone finds this useful. Remember that your physician should be your first reference in all these matters not the internet.

tl dr - If you have a lot of random sex and if condoms sometimes aren't used, get PrEP.

"Found out my 14 year old cousin is gay, parents don't know


Bit of a long post sorry

This all started a few days when ago my aunt and uncle were going out of town on business trips and asked if I could stay over for a few days and look after my 3 cousins 16(m), 14(m) lets call him Dan and 10(m). One of my duties was to the usual morning routine: wake them up, make sure they have breakfast then drop them off at school. The previous 2 day's had gone to plan, however, on this particular day was certainly not the case. 

I made the cardinal sin of not knocking before entering Dan's room in the morning under the assumption that he'd still be asleep and I'd had to wake him up. Unfortunately he was well awake and working at relieving the typical teenager morning wood, he also happened to be watching gay porn on his laptop. Needless to say I hastily made my escape in complete silence whilst he promptly shut his laptop and covered up (I made sure to shut the door on my way out). Shocked to say the least I took a couple of minute to compose myself and thought it was best pretend nothing happened and proceed to wake his brothers (knocking on their doors first). The morning routine went on as usual except for the obvious silence and attempts not to make eye contact with me from Dan. 

I then went to uni and tried to not think about it and was dreading having to go back and pick them up from school in the afternoon. But I've got a job to do and suck it up. I pick them drive home and park in the garage, the two other boys jump out of the car and it just Dan and I. What follows is undoubtedly the most difficult conversation that I've had to date

Dan: hey.. um

Me: hey.. um, I'm sorry that I barged into your roo-

Dan: You won't tell them right?

Me: Who?

Dan: Parent's and brothers

Me: Of coarse not, look you don't have to be ashamed about anything that happened, it normal for your age (I was avoiding the gay porn)

Dan: No, you know what I mean

Me:(at this point I was thinking ""oh fuck"") Dan, you like what you like and no one should judge you for that (yeah, not the most eloquent line but it's the best I had)  
 
Dan: Yeah, but please don't

Me: I promise

I then heard my name called out by one of the other boys and I told Dan that we'll talk again later.

So this is where I'm at, I want to tell him that no matter what his sexuality is his family and friends will love him, however, being the 21yo cousin that occasionally comes over I just don't feel qualified to do so. I also want to tell his parent to get the burden of my back but I also couldn't live with myself if I did. Do you guys have any tips as to how I should handle this?

TL;DR Caught cousin masturbating to gay porn, don't know what to do/say"
