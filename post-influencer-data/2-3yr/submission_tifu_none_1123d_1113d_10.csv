"TIFU by pretending not to be Korean


So I'm Korean-Canadian but was born in Canada and have grown up here my entire life. I ""speak"" Korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny Canadian accent.

Fuck-up happened yesterday. I’m walking down the sidewalk and who I assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in Korean over a directory sign. I ask (in Korean) if they need any help. The dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks Korean. The girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" They’re looking for a nearby mall so I offer to walk them over there since the train station I need is nearby anyway.

The dad asks me where I learned to speak Korean so well. This is where the fuck-up begins. I'm pretty insecure about my spoken Korean, so when the dad asks where I learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it’s obvious I’m not “actually” Korean. It doesn’t help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and I want to impress her for some reason. So, I lie. Stupid idea. I say I’m actually Chinese and learned Korean on my spare time, changing my skills from “mediocre for a Korean person” to “impressive for a Chinese person.”

Alas, the dad immediately switches to Mandarin which I can’t speak a word of. This would have been the time to come clean. Instead, panicking at having been exposed, I do my best confused face and then pretend I misspoke and said the Korean word for “Chinese” (Jung-guk) when I in fact meant “Japanese” (Ilbon). Ha-ha, sorry, my Korean isn’t very good, right?

Of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited Japanese, which I also can’t speak a word of. I’m in too deep at this point and can’t tell them I’m Vietnamese or some other variety of Asian without making myself even more suspicious, so I do the only logical thing and say I am indeed Japanese but don’t actually speak Japanese (but learned Korean cuz lol I’m a traitor to my Japanese heritage).

We reach the mall and I’m all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect English – damn polyglots) what I do. I say I go to the local university. She excitedly tells me that she’s starting at the same university in September, and that she has just arrived in Canada from Korea. Her “dad” seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to Korea.

It turns out that the girl is actually Japanese but went to some exchange program in Korea for a few years, and that the “dad” is actually her Chinese-born Korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to Canada. So, not only did I pretend not to be Korean to two people who weren’t even Korean, but I pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man and have now convinced a Japanese girl that I’m Japanese.

So I exchanged contact information with the girl and we’ve been talking a lot online since yesterday. Turns out she’s super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. We have a ton in common too. We have the same major, and we’re the same age, though she’s three years behind me because of her exchange program. She seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn’t know anybody in Canada and has been talking to me a lot. I’m becoming increasingly aware that I can’t pretend to be Japanese forever to this girl and I need to tell her I’m actually Korean, but early on she asked me about my family and I went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from Kyoto (picked a random city), etc. I've done fucked up, Reddit, and I feel terrible about it.

**TL;DR:** Am Korean, pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man, then pretended to be Japanese to an awesome Japanese girl and am now her first friend in Canada (based on a dirty lie).


**EDIT:** OHHH FUCK I THINK SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT BUT I'M NOT SURE AND I HAVEN'T COME CLEAN YET HELP

**EDIT 2 (Night of the 2nd Day):** Thank you all for the sage advice. I have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. I'm sure she'd oblige me and do the beheading part.
Anyway, I do think we're going on a date tomorrow and I thought I should come clean in person rather than over text. Will keep you all updated (unless I die). I haven't even been on a date in over two years so that's already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. As some have pointed out, I am kinda concerned that she's only interested in me because she thinks I'm Japanese, but I think that's more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (Canada) when her first friend is a fellow Japanese person. Maybe I'm terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. In any case, I'll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there's no solving that completely). Wish me luck in as many languages as you can, Reddit. Gamsahamnida.

Also: they don't use Reddit much in Japan and Korea, do they? I'd hate to be busted via a Reddit thread Q_Q

**EDIT 3 (Still Night of the 2nd Day)**: OH FUCK GUYS I FUCKED UP AGAIN. I was afraid she might stumble upon this post so I asked her if she has heard of Reddit cuz I'm a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and I just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she's gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am I so stupid.

DON'T LIE, KIDS. LYING IS VERY VERY BAD.

**EDIT 4 (Still Night of the 2nd Day):** Okay I think crisis averted for now. She just went to sleep without any sign of having read this. I'm also going to attempt to sleep and hope I wake up Japanese. Will update. Sayonara, Reddit."
"TIFU by injecting myself with Leukemia cells


Title speaks for itself. I was trying to inject mice to give them cancer and accidentally poked my finger. It started bleeding and its possible that the cancer cells could've entered my bloodstream.

Currently patiently waiting at the ER.

Wish me luck Reddit.

Edit: just to clarify, mice don't get T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) naturally. These is an immortal T-ALL from humans.

Update: Hey guys, sorry for the late update but here's the situation:
Doctor told me what most of you guys have been telling me that my immune system will likely take care of it. But if any swelling deveps I should come see them. My PI was very concerned when I told her but were hoping for the best. I've filled out the WSIB forms just in case.

Thanks for all your comments guys. 

I'll update if anything new comes up"
"TIFU by drawing a magical sword during an important meeting at work.


Today there was a full team meeting at my company.  About 20 of us were gathered in the main conference room, with another office (and several ""tele-commuting"" workers) conferenced in on the flatscreen.  We were reviewing progress on some of our work, as well as discussing clients and performance.  It was an ""all hands"" meeting and fairly high level, with the CEO and CTO in attendance, etc.

Anyway - I have no idea why, as I haven't drawn one since I was in elementary school, but about halfway through the meeting I grew restless, turned the page of my moleskine notebook, and started doodling a sword - something I used to do a lot as a child (and haven't done in 30 years...). I have no idea why I did this...  I must have zoned out completely because the CEO had to ask loudly (and maybe repeatedly): ""What is that?""  When I returned to reality, I looked up to see the entire room staring at me, and the CEO asked again ""What is that?  What are you doing?"" and he started laughing.  ""Let me see that."" He said.  I flushed red and reluctantly admitted: ""It's a sword.""  The ENTIRE room erupted in laughter and borderline sympathetic cackles, and the CEO took my notebook and held it up for everyone to see, including the video-conferenced coworkers.  I shrank in my seat as someone pointed out the sun-sparkles on the blade and asked me if the hilt was jeweled. One of the newly hired kids asked aloud what its DPS was, which made the entire IT department erupt into laughter again.  I wanted to die, and quickly apologized... when the laughter died, the meeting carried on - this time with me at rapt attention.  However, I endured redfaced stifled laughter looks from everyone in the room for the duration of the roundup.

I'm 40, and again - I haven't drawn a sword since I was a kid.  No idea why I did this but of course when I decide to it's in the worst possible place with the worst possible outcome.

[EDIT: Wow, woke up to this exploding overnight... did not expect that.  Thanks for the love!  I feel (slightly) better about the situation now - and when the time is right I shall share this thread with the rest of the team here at the office... Really humbled, thank you, and thank you for the Reddit Gold!]"
"TIFU By attaching a suction cup dildo to my forehead. [NSFW]


My fiancée and I have gotten a couple new things to try out in the bedroom lately. One of them is a dildo with a suction base. Her and I also have the mental age of 10 and were waving around the floppy pink fun rod within minutes of getting it. 


The obvious next step was to try and stick it to things. The knee worked, chest didn't, and she had a failed attempt on her forehead. Being the one-upper I am, I proceeded to slap that fucker onto my forehead and show her how it's done. Suction was achieved.


After about three minutes of prancing around and slapping things with my dickhorn, I decided to remove it. As soon as I start pulling it off I can tell something is wrong. The rubber stick of love formed a special bond with my forehead, wanting to live out its life with its new best friend.


After some struggling I managed to pull it off with an  audible pop. My fiancée immediately had an 'oh shit' look on her face.


 ""babe, your forehead is purple.""


 I ran into the bathroom to look at it, and it actually wasn't too bad. I figured it would fade quickly.  I thought I had lucked out...


Fast forward one sex later, and my fiancée is again staring at my forehead. ""Oh my God, it's a lot darker."" I went back to the bathroom and yeah, that shit definitely bruised pretty badly. I now have a dildo-caused bruise on my forehead that I'm hoping goes away before I go back to work on Monday. At a bank.

"TIFU by accidentally making my employees think their supervisor had died


Always have loved reading TIFUs, never thought I would have to submit one...happened this week. 

Just for context, I work at a fairly large hospital (but small enough and old enough where mostly everyone knows each other) as a director.  I have a few managers and supervisors that work varying shifts. These supervisors directly oversee about 100 staff members all together. In our department, news spreads like wildfire. For example, I came in on an off shift recently and saw one employee when I walked through the door. 10 minutes later, the whole department knew I was in and everyone ~~got up from their hiding spots~~ was hard at work as I walked the building. 

One of the supervisors, Lisa, just couldn't handle the job. Things weren't getting done, didn't have respect from or control of her staff, etc. I had spoke with her on several occasions about these concerns and nothing was improving. Sadly, it was time for her to move on. Met with HR, wrote out the termination. Dreaded it all day. Finally it was time to meet with her and deliver. It went pretty well. She understood and thanked me for all of the support and working with her. Great! That is now over. Still a sad situation. 

We walked out. She said goodbye. I go back to HR just to debrief and HR suggested that I go around and inform the employees who are working of the situation. Typically HR is very ""walk a fine line-ish"" and obviously says I can't let them know the details or reason she was let go. Just told me to state something along the lines of ""she is no longer with the organization."" Blah blah blah. 

Here is the FU:

I think to myself, I should probably hold a quick huddle and let everyone know at the same time since this will spread after I tell one person. I would like everyone to hear it from me first instead of an out of control game of telephone
(In hindsight this would have worked out better). 

It was a long stressful day. I thought, what the hell, I'll just go and talk to each employee since having everyone gather for a huddle would be a task in itself and I really could use some exercise. Plus, I don't think anyone will take it too hard. 

1st person I see. 

Hey, how has your day been? How is your family, etc. Well hey, I'm just coming around to let you know Lisa **is no longer with us**

His response surprised me at this moment. He said something like "" oh my gosh, what happened?"" I obviously said I wasn't able to speak about it. He also stated ""I just talked to her yesterday"" shaking his head. Again, I thought nothing of this at the time. Multiply this conversation with about 25 others. 

Alright, phew. That is over with. Kind of surprised that everyone seemed to take it so hard. It starts to click as I'm driving home. They think **she died.** Maybe I wasn't specific enough. 

Maybe not. I'm just overthinking it. 

NOPE. Later that night I start to receive text from Lisa asking what the hell is happening. She is receiving texts from employees and friends now at this point. Employees have started leaving messages on her Facebook page saying RIP. This is seen by all of her Facebook friends.

She now will have to tell all of her friends and family that she was let go to explain this misunderstanding. I feel terrible about it. I've apologized to her, the staff, pretty much anyone I see in passing at work. 

TL;DNR: fired someone and proceeded to accidentally explain it to staff where they thought she has died. now she has to explain to everyone she knows that she was fired and definitely not dead


**EDIT**: Wow, a lot of comments I'll have to read through tonight! Just as an update, I did meet with the department and cleared the air. Obviously, everyone was already aware that she was not, in fact, dead. I have since talked to her again and she found another position! She was all shits and giggles about the whole situation. She said it made it easier in retrospect. 

I'm sure after I read through the comments I'll post an update to clear any questions up. 

Also corrected here to *hear* just so I don't have to read another comment about it.

"TIFU and caused £1.1 million in damages


A few years ago, I took on a part-time lab technician job. I spent a lot of my time in the Instrument Laboratory running a piece of equipment everyone had dubbed “The Bitch”. “The Bitch” when switched on, continuously pumped and drained water through herself, like a really weird fountain. 


I hated this machine. I’d obviously pissed off the Lab Gods somehow and “The Bitch” was sent in retaliation; it took forever to start-up, meaning I had to come in over an hour early just to switch it on and watch it decide whether to work or not. It would troll everyone by creating an issue one minute, magically fixing itself, then creating a whole different, unrelated problem a few hours later. It had even managed to set fire to the computer it was hooked up to. Twice. 


 One Friday morning, I started ~~preparing blood sacrifices for~~ “The Bitch” up and went to get my samples, etc for a fun-filled day of ~~swearing at “The Bitch”~~hard work and learning.  I forget what, but on my way back to the bitch’s lair I was asked to do some other task elsewhere in the building. So I went back to the rabid beast; started her shut down process and other protocols, turned off the tap, stored my samples, thanked the Lab Gods for their mercy and fucked off.


Monday morning comes and I am scheduled to battle “The Bitch” for the day, I was combat ready and first into Mordor. As I reached the hallway, I noticed some water on the floor. Not a little water, A LOT of water. My first thought was a pipe had burst upstairs and was leaking into the lab, but no. No, no, I’m not that lucky. After shutting off the power to the room and phoning my line manager, I punched in the code to open the ~~cage~~ door and scrambled out of the path of a surfing office chair. 


After re-gathering all my whats, I waded into a deleted scene from the Poseidon Adventure. The entire room was flooded, and not just 1 or 2 inches of water, oh no, there was over a foot (the water marks were even higher in some areas; apparently the lab is on a slope, who knew). Most of it had escaped down the hallway when I opened the door, but there was still half a swimming pool in the room.


I could see what had caused Waterworld: The Lab Edition from the doorway. “The Bitch’s” hoses had ruptured spraying arcs of water all over the place like the damn Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas. Ummm, remember when I said I’d turned off the tap? Yeah, apparently I hadn’t.


I’d left the tap on.


Full force.


For over 72 hours.

 
Oops.  


The place was a fucking mess. Plastic-ware, glassware and sample bottles, that had  bobbed along in the floodwaters, made a bid for freedom when I opened the door and were now partying it up in the hallway. All of the paperwork and file boxes looked like they had been rescued from the Titanic and the furniture was now much more Feng Shui.


We eventually found that “The Bitch” was dead; drowned and claimed by Poseidon, never to be resurrected (yay). Most of the computers had also been consigned to Davy Jones Locker along with most of the samples and paperwork. The water had caused problems in the walls of the room too, meaning the entire lab had to be moved elsewhere, and a lot of the furniture had to be replaced.


But that wasn’t the worst of it.


Not by a long shot. You see, “The Bitch” sat on one end of a long bench, with the sink at one side and a computer terminal at the other. At the opposite end of that bench; disassembled and being temporarily stored until its new room was built, was a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). 


Yeah, could someone revive all the scientists that just fainted, please? I’ll wait.


For those of you unfamiliar with this piece of equipment, all you need to know is that it’s a very fancy microscope and this particular model came with *all* the extras. Oh, and it was worth roughly 1.1 million GBP (alternatively, using today’s exchange rate for a few currencies, that’s roughly; 1.45 million USD, 1.88 million AUD, 1.3 million EUR or 1.85 million CAD).


And I drowned it. 
  

On a completely unrelated note, I don’t work there anymore.


**TL; DR: Left a tap on for 72hrs while attached to a piece of lab equipment, the hoses burst and drowned the lab and some very expensive equipment.**  


**Edit:** Firstly, thank you very much to everyone who gilded this post. Secondly, no, I was not fired. I left about 5 months later to focus on my studies.

 

I just want to clear a few things up that I don’t think I’ve explained very well:

**”The Bitch”**

* As I said, the bitch works by pumping water through itself. It connected by plastic tubing to an ordinary tap/faucet, with a drainage hose down the drain of the sink. You could very easily set this up in your own bathroom or kitchen sink. When the tap is on and the machine is on water continuously flows through the machine and down the sink.

 

* When the machine is **off** and the tap is **on**; water gathers in the machine with nowhere to go, the pressure builds and in this case the tubing split (inside the machine first but that didn’t release enough pressure so other hoses burst too). Essentially what I did was leave a tap on with a very expensive plug still in the sink.

 

* ""The Bitch's"" replacement works exactly the same way (though it has reinforced metal tubing) same set up, except now part of the shutdown protocol is that the machine must be physically unconnected from the tap. So now you can physically see if you’ve left the tap on (really hard to see through the tubing) and if you do leave the tap on, it’s just a sink with a running tap. I know this system isn't much better but this was ~6 years ago so the protocols have probably changed again by now (hopefully).


* I’ve mentioned in the comments that “The Bitch” performs Particle Size Analysis; I’m going to err on the side of caution and not saying what type of machine it is or what type of particles.



* I’m not entirely sure how “The Bitch” set fire to its computer that was before I started working there. As far as I am aware, some temperature sensor failed in the machine and it over heated (I don’t know why it didn’t automatically shutdown, that’s way out of my area of knowledge). The machine sort of melted/smoked which spread to the computer causing a small fire. The failed sensor was replaced, with another defective sensor (I was told that this turned out to be the suppliers fault) and it happened again.  

 

**The TEM**


* I have no idea who authorised the TEM being stored in that lab. It was meant to be there for a few days before being moved to its proper room. It was not set up and was not operated in “The Bitch’s” lab. It was however, out of its packaging I do remember that, again I don’t know why. Part of the reason I don’t think I was fired was because the TEM *really* shouldn’t have been in there, it was an active lab and anything could have happened.

 

* I’m pretty certain everything was insured, everything was replaced anyway, I never asked.

"TIFU by putting hair styling gel up my ass


So, I usually sleep naked during the summer cause I don't have an AC in my dorm room. Ever since I started dating my girlfriend, I've been having these weird experiences that I'll dub ""sexsomnia"". I sometimes get up in the middle of the night and do the craziest things to get off without control of myself ( kinda like sleepwalking), then when it actually happens I regain full control of my body and mind. So this time, I was sleeping naked, and i woke up at about 3:30am or so, walked over to my closet and blindly searched for my jar of moisturizing cream, grabbed a jar, and lay down on my bed. I took a wad and proceeded to finger my asshole. It hurt and burned and I don't know why I did it because a few minutes later I woke up with my asshole on fire. Turns out that the perpetrator of this arsical blaze was the jar of cream.
Because it wasn't cream.
It was hair gel.

So there i was, in the bathroom at 3 in the morning, wiping my asshole with wet paper towels and caressing my poor, now-stylish asshole.

TL;DR Tried to moisturize rectum, ended up styling it.

Edit: RIP my inbox

Edit2: It's been a great day peeps. Needless to say i will be sleeping fully clothed tonight."
"TIFU by pranking my boyfriend


Today I randomly learned how to change web text on my own screen using ""inspect element"". I thought it would be hilarious to edit some posts on my boyfriend's Facebook and send him the screenshots to make it look as though he has been hacked.

BF knows I know his password (I am his personal password reminder) so I had to make it seem legit or he would assume I edited his posts using his profile. I changed some of the comments posted by his brother -whose email and password I couldn't possibly know- using some very, very crude language. I took pictures of my fine work with my phone and sent them to BF via Whatsapp asking, ""what the heck is going on???"" As I expected he lost his shit. 

The unfortunate part is that I was distracted by a coworker and was unable to reveal myself on time. By the time I called him to confess my sins he had already sent the pics to his brother. He, in turn, had posted it on his profile to warn the community.

BF responded to my confession by hanging up on me and blocking me on Whatsapp. By now the pics have spread to the whole family, exposing me as a horrible, childish, crude troll. I was eventually unblocked and shamed for my childish behavior. I tried explaining that the ""edit"" could only be seen by me but the damage had been done. I am now hated by both my BF and his very religious family. 

Worth it :')

Edit: 1 I had to use a crappy phone app to edit the pics for, you know, safety. 
2 I mentioned in the post that I took the shots with my phone because windows + print page would mean id have to send to my phone blah blah. 
3 I warned you I'm offensive and childish, but in my defense all the fb posts said hackers post sexual stuff. And my point was to offend. 
4 I know how to spell swallow (but jokes about me lying are welcome)
Soo here are two examples of my fuckup. http://m.imgur.com/gallery/e1UfO"
"TIFU by making some ugly drawing on MS paint (and sending them)


So this happened a couple of years ago when I was graduating high school. I was just recently reminded of it so I thought I’d share it.

I had a sort of rival in high school. We would often pull “pranks” on each other. They were usually just small ones where no one got hurt or in trouble. It was pretty fun to do as we had a lot of classes together in grade 9 and 10. I didn’t see him as much in 11 and 12, but in the back of my mind I had already decided to pull a big graduation prank on him back in grade 10.

&amp;nbsp;

So finally grade 12 comes along. Exams were finished for us a month before graduation/ regular exams. For that month, I went on vacation to celebrate. While outside the country, I devised a “prank” that I could do without actually being back at school. I would pretend to be my rival and send an email to some teachers that had previously taught us. I wanted to make sure the prank wouldn’t get him into too much trouble so the email wouldn’t go on to say anything particularly bad. It’d just be a sort of funny email with some drawings using ms paint.

&amp;nbsp;

While creating the email, I decided the scale was too small. Just to the teacher who taught us? That’s so few. Lame. This is a graduation prank; I have to think bigger! So I expanded it to every staff member in the school. For parent-teacher interviews, usually they send a sheet with all the teacher’s names and rooms. I took that sheet and used it to type out all the teacher’s emails (as emails were generally firstname.lastname@school).

&amp;nbsp;

It took a while, but I finally had all the teachers in my mailing list. The email was basically a thank you note. I'll have a link at the bottom if you want to see it, but basically it thanked everyone in the school for their work and was pretty much devoid of anything offensive (though, I had this one really shit teacher and wanted to take a Jab at him so I sort of did. Also the librarians in my school were really annoying so…). And then I sent it at about the same time regular school classes were done. 

&amp;nbsp;

I heard from a few classmates that some teachers had a chuckle. I even received a reply from one of the vice principals commending my rival as a brilliant student (don’t forget, I was pretending to be him. In order to make it convincing, I created a new email address that was similar to his personal one and sent it from there)! Everything seemed great. My rival even said I got him good.

&amp;nbsp;

Jump to the day of the graduation ceremony. I get a call that wakes me up. It’s from the school. They wanted me to come in that day. So I did. Turns out, not everyone was happy about the email. Namely the principal, shit teacher, and librarian. My rival ratted me out for the guy who actually sent the email after he got called in first. (I also learned during that meeting the he tried to retaliate by send an email posed as me. He only sent it to a handful of teachers though). They lambasted me on impersonating another person saying it could be a criminal offense, as well as lecturing me on embarrassing my teacher and the librarian. Turns out the librarian had cancer or something, so it was extra bad to embarrass her? Something like that. They threatened to not let me attend the ceremony. Which wouldn’t be too awful, but it would be difficult to explain to my parents.

&amp;nbsp;

Well my mum was called in. And I had to apologize. I cheekily to my teacher said something along the lines of, “you are the best physics teacher I ever had.” A bit of a back handed compliment because he was the only physics teacher I ever had… so technically he was also the worst. I kept that bit in my head though.

&amp;nbsp;

In the end everything kinda worked out. My mum was a bit shaken up but we attended the ceremony. It was a bit awkward shaking the hand of my principal who had only just lectured me a few hours earlier. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: I sent an email pretending to be my rival to all the staff in the school. It had a few silly drawings. Embarrassed a few staff so got called into the school on the morning of graduation.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the email, if you’re interested in seeing the contents.

"TIFU by almost burning my house down trying to smooth out a 3D print


So this happened a couple of weeks ago...

I recently got myself a 3D printer and some filament and got printing.
Somewhere i had read that if you want to smooth out prints you can do an acetone vapor treatment in a closed container.
This would take a couple of hours at room temperature, but i also read that if you heat up the acetone that it can be done in just minutes.

So off i went to get some acetone from the local hardware store and put half a centimeter of the fluid into a large cooking pan.
When i told my wife that acetone was highly flammable, she had the bright idea to get the fire-blanket read 'just in case'.
I laughed a bit but thought it was a good idea anyway.

Then i hang my beautiful 3D printed Mario figure inside of the pan with a wire connected to a wooden spoon suspended on top of the pan.

Then i turned on the stove at its lowest setting as it was just a small layer of fluid to heat up and i didn't need it to get too hot because acetone is, again, highly flammable.

Ok so everything is going just fine, vapor is moving over Mario into the exhaust hood...
Just until i get the bright idea to make it even go faster...

I decide to put the lid on the pan to 'trap' the vapor in an effort to speed this process up.
So first i try a large lid, but it wasn't really suited for this pan.
Then i try the pan's own lid and right as i put it on, shit hits the fan.

I literally had created a rocket engine on my stove (no joke).
This is really what it looked like and how it sounded.

So i quickly grabbed the blanket that my shocked wife was holding and threw it over the pan.
This helped. For like 5 seconds.
I wet a little towel that we normally use to dry our hands with, also this just buys me seconds.

In the meantime i yell to my wife to open the yard-door because i am going to get the pan and put it in the yard.
nope.jpg the pan is way too hot and the flames too high, i risk letting it fall out of my hands onto the furniture and stuff.

But i'll be damned if i let my house get burned down by this TIFU.
So i open up the kitchen window and 'abort' the kitchen fire by throwing the pan outside trough the window.

Problem solved!

But no it's not.
The pan is now under a big conifer in the front yard, and it hasn't rained for weeks.
Everything is dry as fuck.
So yes, it starts burning at the bottom.
I'm like 'FUCK' and run outside and pull the pan from beneath the conifer onto the pavement.
by then the pan almost stopped burning because most of the acetone has burned up.

I don't know how but the conifer stopped burning before getting out of hand, maybe i was quick enough.

So yeah i almost burned my house down.
I got myself a new blanket and also a fire extinguisher the next day.

What happened to Mario? Well he just looks like a lump of molten plastic now.

Funny thing is, that i printed Mario with PLA plastic and that PLA doesn't react with acetone.
So my plan wouldn't work anyway x).

Oh and btw, i have it all on video.
It's footage from our security camera (low fps).
I have a link but the rules prohibit placing it here. Maybe i can post it in the comments.

TL;DR Don't put acetone on your stove, it will burn your house down.

Edit: I forgot to mention that in the process of throwing the pan out of the window all my arm hair from my right arm got scorched and when pulling the pan from underneath the conifer i burned my hands in 8 places. It took about 10 days to heal (no scars =D) no pics of the burns.

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold, stranger!"
"TIFU by accidentally suggesting an inappropriate acronym for a Christian camp and giving our church a bad name.


So this wasn't actually today as lots of these stories are, but anyway in January this year I attended a  Christian camp, called “leaders in training” or (LiT) with six other people from my church. The camp is aimed at late teens helping them to learn how to lead events in local churches and what not. Anyway the camp is pretty big and lots of different “types” of Christians were there, some who are very strict and conservative, others who are not as much.

On the first night our church group is sitting together in the main hall waiting for the main teaching/service to begin for the night. One of my friends mentions to me how he thinks the name wasn’t very well thought out. The camp likes to seem modern to the younger generation and had a large social media presence using the hashtag “Lit”. Upon viewing the hashtag half the results were photos of people at the camp, or posts concerning it, and the other half was of people smoking weed.

Here’s where I mess up. I respond to my friend that “I agree, the name is misleading and suggests something they no doubt wouldn’t like to be associated with, and even if you ignore that, the name doesn’t even suggest it’s a Christian camp”
Here it comes…
“It’s a bad acronym, they should have just called it “Christian Leaders in Training” instead.”

It took about two second before my friend and I realised why this wouldn’t be a suitable replacement. After these two seconds my friend bursts out laughing, arousing the interest of the rest of my church group (no pun intended).
He then explains the conversation to the rest of the church group. They were also amused, however one of my friends didn’t understand why this was inappropriate and says (quite loudly) “Clit? Why is that so funny? What’s wrong with Clit?”

The thirty or so people around our little group, who have just heard this question completely out of context, give our group some very upset and indignant looks.

So it’s night one and our little church group gets a bad rep thanks to my lack of thinking before speaking.

TL;DR Accidentally gave my church group a bad rep by suggesting the name of the camp should be changed to the shortened form of the word “clitoris”.

Edit: knew this would probably start a lot of religion hate, so far I'm relatively proud of the lack of chaos (Not a challenge). Also all these other examples of bad acronyms are great thanks for making me feel a little less stupid. Have a wonderful day people

Edit2: Yeah just removing the ""in"" would make a lot of sense for both the original name and my unfortunate suggestion

Edit3: My bad, to clarify bad rep wasn't just because people heard the word ""clit"", it was from the lack of context, essentially it seemed like I was telling dirty jokes and having a go at the name of the camp, instead of just our group laughing at my lack of thinking before talking. "
