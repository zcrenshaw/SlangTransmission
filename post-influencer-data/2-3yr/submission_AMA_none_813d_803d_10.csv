"Ex Lifer... AMA!


I am an ex-convict, having completed what is considered a life-sentence (of thirty (30) years or more) in Indiana prisons.  I received early-parole after having completed four (4) college degrees.  My crime: Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute Cocaine, as a Class A Felony, which, in Indiana, merely consists of possessing, or attempting to possess, three (3) or more grams of cocaine (the amount equivalent to one (1) sugar packet.  As a Class A Felon, my class of felony is grouped with felons normally associated with serious, violent crimes: Rapists, Murderers, Arsonists, Child Molesters, and Kidnappers.  I was facing one hundred and fourteen (114) years, but pleaded guilty to a range of sentencing of zero years, to no greater than forty (40) years.   The same judge who sentenced Mike Tyson to six (6) years for rape, The Honorable Patricia Gifford, sentenced me to thirty (30) for my first criminal conviction....   AMA."
"I can pop my eyes out of my head and won $2500 from Ripley's Believe It Or Not because of it, AMA!!


I'm a 28 year old woman who can and has been popping my eyes out of my head since I was in the 7th grade.

I entered a nationwide funny face contest from Ripleys and won, earning $2500.

If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them!

"(NSFW) All my lady parts are defective. AMA


Within the last 3 months I have been diagnosed with endometriosis, hematometra, polypoid fragments, vaginismus, vulvodynia, eczema of the vulva, and malformation of my external genital area. I have been unsuccessfully trying to get a hysterectomy to solve some of these issues but my doctors are making me jump through years worth of hoops because I'm 23, married, and don't ever want kids.  
Ask me literally anything.  
  
EDIT: Thank you everyone for the comments, I'm still going to reply as they come in but wanted to address something that comes up a lot.  
The oral/anal thing has been covered numerous times so I won't reply to those basic comments anymore. I tried anal and it didn't do anything for either of us, and I have an inherent repulsion to oral. When I say I rather be in pain than do oral, that should be enough to give you a picture of how much I DO NOT LIKE ORAL. I'm in pain all the time anyway, so having pain after sex is just par for the course. I can handle it. Stop asking."

I'm in SK and have been volunteering for about three years now. They tell me their stories, and I can share them with you as long as I don't use their names. Fire away."
