"The People in Zurich (state [and city] in Switzerland), where I live just voted with 80% against a constitutional declaration that marriage should only be between men and women!


I didn't think it would be accepted, but I was really surprised and happy about such a clear no!

If the people in your country could vote about gay-marriage, what would the results look like?"
"Guys, you won't believe this. A Republican anti-gay politician gets caught sexting a 17 year old guy


I can't wait until we catch Mike Pence doing this shit. 

**The right side of politics would be shook!** The GOP would probably avoid any harsh anti-gay politicians because of the history of them being secretly homo, the bad publicity could literally save our rights ironically lol

"A great guy I'm dating turned out to be my boss at my new job. Not sure what to do now.


I'm 21, just graduated and moved to a new city for my new job. I have zero experience in relationships, don't have any gay friends. I moved here about a month before work starts, and since no one knows me, I decided to have a little fun with Tinder. 

A few lame dates later, I got matched up with a 29 year old hottie. Despite the age gap, we had a lot of common interests and the five dates I've had with him were enjoyable. On the most recent date, we made out in his car and he wanted to take it further at his place. I was supposed to start work the next day, so I hadn't planned on staying out late, but because I really like him, I agreed. 

We did everything short of anal. I got cold feet and told him I wasn't ready. He was really nice about it and said it's ok, we'd do it next time. I spent the night there and the next morning I was a wreck because I was running late for my new job and had no clean clothes. He offered to drive me there and lent me his (rather ill-fitting) clothes.

Everything seemed to be going great - potential great boyfriend, had sex, heading for new dream job. Until he saw the address he was supposed to drive me to and said ""Hey what a coincidence, I work in that building too."" Thought nothing of it, but a little later while getting stuck in the traffic, he said ""you work in creative, don't you? But there's only XXX company there. You don't happen to work there, do you?""

""Why, yes, I do!"" 

You must be thinking how in our course of 5 excellent dates, we never once talked about where we worked. I ask myself that too. I think we must have broached the subject at one point because we do know we work in the same industry and that's how we realise we have common interests. Somehow we neglected to talk about the company we work for.

He dropped the bomb with ""Ah, welcome aboard, I guess. ""

Ok, no big deal, I thought, the company is large and we are bound to be in different departments.

We parted ways at the entrance, and I met the Human Resource person. We chatted a bit, she gave me an orientation of the place and introduced me to the people on my floor, and then my immediate colleagues. Guess who got introduced to me as head of our team?

I couldn't believe it, I thought this sort of coincidence only happens on TV. But it has happened, anyway. 

I spent the rest of the day feeling out of sorts in my two-sizes-too-big shirt, feeling that at least someone in that department must have seen it on their boss. Didn't help that every time I see my date-turned-boss walk out of his office and smile at me, I think of the embarrassing noob things I did last night and feel myself burning up. I was so distressed I made some unbelievably silly mistakes in my work. And when my colleagues asked me to join them for my welcome party after work, I told them I was unwell. 

So everyone now probably knows me as the useless anti-social new guy who can't even dress himself properly. It has been a nightmarish first day.

My date-turned-boss called me at night to ask if I'm ok and we had a little chat. He did most of the talking because I'm still confused as hell. He assured me that the company is LGBT-friendly and has no restrictions on employees dating. He is personally out of the closet but we can date discretely. He also said he really likes me (to the point of wanting to ask me to be his boyfriend) but will respect my decision if I want to end it with him. I've asked him about the possibility of me getting transferred, but his team is the only one with openings now. He said it may be possible in the future but he can't promise that. He can't offer any further insights as it's the first time he's encountered such a problem. He did crack a joke and say he'd work doubly hard and get promoted quickly so we wouldn't have to work closely together. That made me smile for probably the first time all day.

I feel torn. I want to continue my relationship with him and I can see us getting further. But I'm afraid that this will have a negative impact on my job. This is my dream company and I want to do well at my job. I really really want to give this a chance though. On the other hand I'm also afraid that after we go too far and discover that it can't work out, the repercussions and heartbreak will be far worst than if I end it now.

What are your thoughts? I've done a search on this sub and see that ""don't shit where you eat"" is a common response. I'm not disputing this, but I hope to find other perspectives, if any. Thanks."

"Ran into the guy I almost committed suicide for 3 years ago.


3 years ago when I was coming to terms of being gay I was seeing some guy that I went to high school with. We were the Gays playing to be straight (Example, we fooled around and then we would talk about our girlfriends). Unfortunately I developed really strong feelings for him, we used to ""joke"" about getting married and spend the rest of our lives together and while I am not sure what saying those things meat to him they did mean a lot to me. 

At some point I was able to come to terms that I was gay and also that I was in love with him. So long story short he was the first person that I came out to. It was a shitshow. He told me that I was crazy that we never did the stuff I was telling him we did (kissing, oral sex, etc). He rejected me and I almost couldn't handle it. That same night I worked a night shift and it ended at 1am. I was devastated and  I thought to myself that if the only person that I was able to be who I really was rejected me of course I was going to be rejected by everybody else. I became suicidal and I wanted to end it that same night. I live in south America and there's a lot of bridges out here and when I was driving back home I went to one of those bridges without even thinking about it. I parked my car there and turned the emergency lights on and I stayed there for about 20 minutes thinking to myself if that was the right decision or not. Then the police came. They got me out of my car and almost arrested me because they thought I was on drugs or drunk but then one of them kind of figured me out and told me that what I was about to do was not right and that there was a solution for everything. They were really nice and they took me home. 

That was a turning point in my life. The next day I came out to my 2 best friends and they were very supportive now 3 years after that all my family knows and they have been great I am really blessed to have all the support I have. 

So going back to today I was going out with one of my best friends for dinner and I got to this mall kind of early so I was checking some clothes in Zara, when I was going to the dressing room there he was with his girlfriend holding hands. He stared at me and I stared at him too I looked him in they eyes and he just stared somewhere else.  Next thing I know I was walking out of the store feeling like shit, I couldn't keep the tears I broke down and started crying I went to the bathroom to get my shit together. 

The rejection of this guy almost made me end my life and seeing him after all this time I can't even begin to describe how bad I feel, seeing him reminded me of the worst time of my life and also all of the amazing things I'd have missed if I had ended it right there. I have tears in my eyes right now and I don't know how to feel I guess I just wanted to vent.  :'(

"A message to everyone who worries about being single. Please, it's for you.


Seeing how many of you guys feel your life is not fulfilling enough being on your own, this is for you:

Please stop looking for a relationship, regardless of whether you've already been in one or not, regardless of how you think you look, regardless of whether you think someone will ever love you or not and regardless of how old you are.

You have so much love and affection to offer, but there's no one out there who wants them? Doesn't need to be. YOU are the person who should be receiving your love, YOU are the only one truly worth for yourself.

There is only one person who spends 100% of its time with you and you already know who it is. No one knows you better than you do and never will. 

Being self-content should be your number 1 priority in life. You first have to achieve that before ANYTHING else. If you don't have friends and/or find it generally difficult to form meaningful connection with people, then, sorry, you don't love yourself enough. An you are not ready to invest your time in other people until you do.

Let's say you don't love yourself enough but you still somehow manage to form connection with some people and/or even have a relationship. And now you feel so happy; isn't that everything you ever wanted?

No, it's not. You might think you're happy but in reality, your condition would be more alarming than ever. Engaging in a relationship when you're obviously not ready for one promotes dependence. If you do just that, you're dependent and vulnerable. There is another person who is responsible for your happiness and that person isn't you. If they suddenly change their mind for whatever reason, it's over, and you have to suffer the consequences. Alone.

Stop looking for happiness through interactions with other people, even friends. If you don't love yourself enough, how do you expect that other will love you? Now, I'm not saying to ditch people and wander off in the woods. What I'm saying is: achieve self-contentment before investing affection in anything else.

Ok, how do you do that? I really want to give you guys tips, but it's strongly individual. For starters, start investing time in something that you really like. It got to be something that doesn't involve other people but even if it does, their involvement should never be related to you enjoying the said activity. And you have to do it because you LIKE it and it feels your world with joy, not because you want to distract yourself from being on your own. In short, learn to enjoy your solitude.

Of course, you also have to keep improving yourself but the things you do have to bring you satisfaction in one form or another. Some people suggest that you should improve your whole image by eating healthy, going to the gym etc. I wouldn't strictly recommend that, however. Again, you have to do that for the right reason. If you're doing it just to have better chances on the dating scene, then I wouldn't recommend it.

After and only after you love yourself, you're ready to love others and be loved. Friends and boyfriends will come, trust me. You won't even have to spare that many energy to attract them, they'll just come. Because you won't be explicitly looking for them. That's how everything works.

And even if they don't, you will be ok. But only if you've truly achieved self-contentement.

TL;DR: All your problems stem from one single truth: you don't love yourself enough. If you actually believe your happiness depends on being with other people, you have a serious flaw you have to work on. Learn to be self-content first. Improve yourself and enjoy your solitude. After you love yourself, other people will love you. But please, read the whole post just in case, I didn't write it only for myself."
