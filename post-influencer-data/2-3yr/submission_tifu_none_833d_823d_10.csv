"TIFU by hiptossing my girlfriend.


Obligatory ""this happened a while ago, not actually today.""

On this particularly beautiful day, my girlfriend and I had decided to celebrate our recent move to a new town, and my new job. We went to the first place we thought of, Chili's. Why? I don't know. Don't judge us.
As I'm sure it happens with many of us, Chili's has a way of...cleansing the body. For whatever reason, it was not agreeing with me that day. Not even five minutes into the drive home, my guts dropped. Not just a little, either. I was about to burn a hole through my seat.

Sensing my urgency, my girlfriend decided that she wasn't going to play nice. To this day, I don't know what possessed her to impede my inevitable and foul journey to the land of porcelain, but she did. I unlocked our door and went up the steps two at a time, carefully managing the muscles in my ass to ensure that I didn't...give away my position. My girlfriend was also on her way up the stairs behind me, and I'm not trying to catch a manslaughter charge if she passed through a cloud of that.

I was two steps into the living room when she called to me, likely from the pits of hell in which she came. ""Judoka! Come back real quick!"" She hissed. Being the loving man that I am, I turned around. She made it to the top of the stairs and I watched her mouth curl into a smile. ""I love you!"" She cheered, way too excited for the situation. She wrapped her arms around me and hugged me.

""Alright. I love you, too."" I replied as I began to turn back towards the bedroom and bathroom door. She didn't let go. In fact, she tightened her grip. Why was this happening to me? ""Darlin, let me go. I have to poop. NOW!"" I said, with strong urgency in my voice. She merely laughed in response.

I've been doing martial arts for a long time. Taekwondo, Karate, Boxing, Kickboxing, Brazilian Jiujitsu, and JUDO. I was a cop and a correctional officer. I had to escape. How did I escape before my bowels did the same?

I tucked my arm in close and squeezed it up between my chest and hers, and quickly snaked over her arm and grabbed a hold of her tricep. As I took a step back towards the bedroom door, I pulled her with me. She was off balance, as is necessary for a good Judo throw, in this case, a modified tsurikomi goshi. My other arm went up behind her and grabbed her shoulder. I flared my elbow out to lift her arm and start some rotation, furthering her off balance. At the last second, I dropped my hips under hers and popped my ass backwards, completing the throw.

She landed squarely on her back, and I heard the air leave her lungs, but I didn't turn around. I had a mission to accomplish, and she made the unfortunate mistake of standing between me and my dignity.
Sorry, darlin. She didn't talk to me for almost a week after that.

TL;DR - I ate bad food, had an immediate need for bowel evacuation, my girlfriend impeded me, and was judo tossed to the ground for her infraction upon my dignity.

EDIT: Not that this is still relevant, but I would like to let everyone know that the entire point of this is that I hiptossed my girlfriend, which is wrong, and rightfully caused a brief period of strife between us. Let's calm down now and move along with our lives."
"TIFU by trying to remove a tick from my dog


This just happened, but here's some backstory:

On mother's day, we went to my brother's​ place up in the mountains, and his dog and ours went running through the woods.

Later, I pointed out a bug crawling across the floor.

""Oh, gross. A tick."" my nephew says, before smashing it into oblivion.

""Yeah, you might want to check your dog when you get home. They're likely the ones who brought them in.""

So we get home and scour our girl for ticks, because one of those little shits is the last thing we want. But dammit, dogs have a lot of fur! How the hell am I supposed to find one, even if it's there?

So we called it good, and figured if one shows up, we'll notice.

Fast forward to today.

As we were getting in bed for the night, I noticed she was licking a spot just inside her hind leg. Also, she had seemed more lethargic than usual lately.

I thought, 'Maybe we should do another tick check, just in case.'

Our room is kinda dark, so I turn on the flashlight on my phone, and have her roll over so I can check the spot she was licking. Sure enough, I see this little black fucker attached her belly.

Fuck.

I run into the bathroom and grab the tweezers. I go back to her, hold her down, and try as I might to pinch that bitch off. 

But, shit! It's embedded deep!

And my poor girl is yelling and crying and wriggling like crazy!

This sucks!

So I get her up on the bed and turn on the overhead light so I can see it better.

That's when I notice another tick.

Fuck!

And another!

And...another...

...and they're all lined up...

That's when I realize, they weren't ticks.

They are her nipples.

Fuck.

TL;DR was trying to de-tick my dog, almost de-nippled my dog.

Good thing dogs are forgiving.

Sorry girl.

Edit: To clarify, her nipple is fine, albeit mildly tweaked.

Also, I forgot to address the lethargy comment. She's getting older, and my wife and I started running outside again for the summer. I was just being cautious (maybe a bit too much so).

And yes, I know I'm stupid.

"TIFU by trying to popping a forehead zit and almost cutting my balls off


I'm coming out of the shower doing a bit of a dance to the cranked up stereo. It's Saturday and I've got nowhere to go and the day belongs to me, everything is awesome. As I'm heading to grab some clothes I do a little peacock preening in the mirror above the dresser only to discover a stress zit above my eyebrow. This will not do on my most awesome day of days. Quickly leaning in I fail to notice one of the draws is slightly open. As I lean in my knee pushes the drawer close, only problem is my dick and balls are hanging low.

Pain, instant pain, nothing but pain, inconceivable pain.

So an hour later I'm sitting here in front of reddit without pants (again) in the unusual position of trying not to swell up, icepack wedged between my legs. Feel free to come up your own moral for this story as I contemplate spending my most awesome day of days doing some serious day drinking.

TL;DR  Day drinking pantless is not as much fun as I thought it would be after drawer tries to bite my balls off"
"TIFU when my teacher almost called Child Services because of a pair of binoculars.


Like most Tifu’s, this did not happen today, but rather when I was younger. Perhaps 5 or 6. My dad was all too happy to fill in the details where I was lacking, because he thought it was “bloody hilarious.” 

So when I was a kid, I received a pair of binoculars for my birthday - a pair of cheap, plastic red ones that were actually rather powerful. I spent quite a lot of time looking into our backyard with them, picking out local wildlife and being awed by the detail. 

But alas, as with all children, a mix of curiosity and boredom got the better of me over time. So, while in the kitchen I flipped the binoculars over and a new, friggin’ world was born. 

Everything looked further away, condensed into tiny, distant versions of themselves. I walked all around our kitchen, banishing everything in sight to the nether regions of an optic void. 

My parents, who were sitting in the kitchen at the time, watched me explore happily…up to the point where I walked straight into a wall. The rims of the binoculars slammed into my face and I fell back, hard, with giant rings around my eyes. 

It hurt quite a bit, but after a bit of crying from me and laughter from my parents, I was all right. My dad decided I resembled a raccoon. 

Fast forward to the next day. School time. I mostly forgot about the state of my eyes as the bruising was largely superficial - just two, big purple rings around the rims, making me look like a goddamn trash panda.

When I went into class, my classmates started asking me what happened and, given what did happen, I lied. All they got were bits and fragments of a fight, possibly with a bully, perhaps a sibling. My teacher eventually picked up on it, seeing the other kids clustered around me and me sitting very still, eyes on my desk, very red in the face. 

We’ll call her Ms. Smith for the sake of privacy, and she was very caring. She told the other kids to go to their seats and then knelt to ask me what happened. 

As with the others, I only etched out a series of incomprehensible fragments. Accident, hit, eyes, parents, laughing, not too bad. Literally anything to avoid saying I’d walked into a goddamn wall because I looked through binoculars backwards.

For her, this came across as a textbook child-abuse case. She rubbed my shoulder and told me everything would be all right. Then she went about teaching class, making sure to check up on me throughout the day.

Towards the end class, I’d already begun to forget about the incident, my young mind wondering onto newer things. But when class let out, Ms. Smith gently asked me to wait behind. She sat me next to her desk and informed me that she’d called my parents, wanting to set up a meeting with them. 

I wasn’t sure how to respond, but sure as hell didn’t plan on bringing up the binoculars. So I just nodded and agreed to wait. 

My parents showed up about fifteen minutes later, probably fearing their kid had done something terrible. I remember the look on their faces when Ms. Smith sat them down and asked, very seriously, if they abused their child. 

My dad picked up on her implications immediately, seeing my bruised eyes, and he burst out laughing. My mom just looked appalled, just at the thought of child and abuse being mentioned in the same sentence. 

Ms. Smith, God bless her, retained her composure as best she could, but my dad’s constant cackling made her a bit prickly. She reminded him it was very serious issue, but my dad just kept guffawing until my mom intervened, finally realizing what happened too. 

She explained I’d walked into a wall, like an idiot, looking through binoculars backwards, and that that was why I had two massive rings around my eyes. 

In the midst of all this, I felt overcome with different emotions, and resorted to a sort of half-laugh, half-sob. Ms. Smith asked me if this was true, and I nodded numbly, sniffling. She gave my parents a look conveying her sympathy for their having a kid as bright as a bag of nails. 

My dad, of course, never let me live it down, and bought it up whenever he could, but I learned my lesson. Everyone agreed to keep it quiet for a little while, on account of my embarrassment, but it resurfaced eventually and now I’m telling the wonderful Reddit community about it! 

TL;DR I walked into a wall looking through binoculars backwards, got huge bruises around my eyes, was too embarrassed to tell my teacher why they were there, and she almost called Child Services. 

*Edit: And holy fuck, this thing blew up so now a bunch of you are privy to one of my biggest childhood embarrassments. Well...dealing with shame of childhood trauma is best done in the company of understanding Redditors, as they say, so thank you all. "
"TIFU by going Christmas shopping high and unintentionally roasting my dad


So this happened last Christmas. I needed to do my Christmas shopping and I figured “Why not eat an edible right before this. It will make the lines a bit more bearable.” I thought this was a great idea so I ate the cookie, hopped on the bus and was at the mall in no time. All is well so far and it starts to hit me just about 30 minutes after I get there. I get my mom a nice bath robe, my brother a sick Star Wars Poster and now all I had to do was get my dad a gift. I was thinking and then it hit me, “He could use a Bluetooth earpiece for making calls!” This was a great idea as he was constantly on the phone talking to his clients and I figured it would be nice if he didn’t have to hold the phone up to his ear the whole time. I walked into the store (I honestly can’t remember the name of it) and my baked mind was looking any sort of Bluetooth looking earpiece. I found one, grabbed and bought it. There! My Christmas shopping was a done. I get home, mindlessly wrap the gifts and I was so excited to give everyone their presents.

Christmas morning rolls around and I give my brother the poster, he loves it. I give my mom the fluffy bath robe, she loves it then I give my dad the supposed Bluetooth earpiece, he lets out a nervous laugh and than sets it to the side. I didn’t think much of it at the time because my dad has never been one to love receiving gifts so I brushed it off. Fast forward a week or two and I’ve noticed he’s still be making calls while holding the phone up to his ear. I was a bit bummed out that he wasn’t using my gift but it’s about the thought, right? In this case, I hope he didn’t feel that it was all about the thought and here’s why. 

Fast forward 6 months later to yesterday and my dad tells me to retrieve something from his drawer next to his bed. I retrieve it and guess what else is in there? It’s the Bluetooth earpiece but then it hit me. This was NOT a Bluetooth earpiece to make calls from a phone. It was a god damn hearing aid. I got my 57 year old dad a hearing aid for Christmas. 

Don’t get high and shop, kids. 

TL;DR: Bought my 57 year old dad a hearing aid instead of a Bluetooth earpiece for making phone calls. 


Edit: To anyone doubting my story, it was a noise amplifier similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0061F6QUG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_ma6gozbM3KPDZA). It had a hook around the ear and I thought I was buying something like [this](http://www.smartphonemag.com/old_blogs/media/H500.jpg)."
"TIFU when I tried to put my recently escaped puppy back in his crate at 3 am.


This happened about 10 hours ago. We got our pup, Ranger, a couple weeks ago. He is a black lab. He has been awesome, if a lot of work. The cat isn't a big fan, and does sometimes hiss at him and tries to stay as far away as possible, but I'm sure they'll work it out eventually. Anyways, he usually needs to potty at 1 am and then again at about 5 am. So I have been pretty sleep deprived lately. 

After taking him out at 1 am, I got back in bed and fell asleep. I wake up at 3, super groggy, not sure what's going on. I guess I had left the crate door open and Ranger had somehow wriggled up on the bed to snuggle with me. As he's not totally potty trained, I had to get him back in his crate. 

I pick him up, open the crate and try to put him back in. He starts to protest, but the middle of the night is no time for whining about the crate so I just shove him in there. At that point he has fully waken up. He hisses at me and frantically starts clawing everything in sight, including my arms, then shoots out of the bedroom at mock speed. Still pretty foggy and confused myself, I click on the light. 

There's Ranger, sleeping at the back of the crate. Outside the bedroom, there's Kit Kat, indignantly wondering why I woke him up in the middle of the night from a peaceful sleep and decided right then and there was a good time to lock him in 4'x2' crate with his mortal enemy.

The light also revealed long, deep scratches up and down my arms, bleeding all over the place. 

This pic accurately describes the first couple weeks: https://imgur.com/gallery/km4Gw

TL;DR. Puppy somehow got out of crate to snuggle at night. Groggy, I woke up and shoved him back in there, only to find I was attempting to lock the cat in with the new demon we had brought home. Cat didn't appreciate that and I have some bad scratches to prove it. "
"TIFU by peeing on my cat


As per usual, this was actually yesterday.


My cat is somewhat fixated about me using the toilet. Whenever i take a pee he comes rushing, stands up on his back legs, putting his front paws on the seat and reach his head just watch my fluids hit the surfice, excitingly waiting for the scarry flush to come, wich he is just barely brave enough to stare in the eye. Same goes with #2 wich he stubbornly tries to witness by jumping up on the seat just behind me, just to be chased away the very second he gets up to avoid the REAL disaster. He then just sits there, thoroughly examining the toiletpaper, where it goes, how and why. And then the great flush strikes again. Super interesting.

However.
After a long day of work i decide to relax a bit with a few beers, a pizza and some tinder-swiping. After an hour or so my bladder makes its presence felt, so i take a walk towars the loo, seeing the face of curiosity in the corner of my eye, stalking my steps. The beer has already taken me past caring, and as i stand up i realize the presure is greater than i anticipated, so with a bit of haste i unzip my pants, aim and shoot. 

Now, im a millennial, so im all grown up to adapting the toiletbreaks to the DEAD-time between rounds in video games, making sure im always prepared to pwn some noobs the moment i rezip, regardless the respawn time. I pee hard. I pee with force. I pee to win.

It's all in slowmotion. 
As my wrath is airborne i feel a tingle to my leg and i see the head of Inspector McKitty reaching up under my badonkadonk, streching that little head higher and higher to get a view of the full interior of the toilet and BAM.
The beam hits him dead centre in the back of his head, but he's still in motion upwards, denching his neck and upper back in well consentrated piss. The spalsh soaks the the cat, the room and me.

Suddenly time no longers move slowly.

Neither does the cat. Obviously considering this an assault on my behalf he runs away from me with fear into the livingroom, dripping.
Pissdripping cat in the furniture is bad news, so i run after him, scaring him up even more. Up on the sofa, dinner table, carpet, sofa again. As i get desperate to stop this sprinkler of pee, i yell higher, wave my arms more clearly making it worse. The chase goes into the the bedroom. 
ohgodnotthebed.jpg
In UNDER the bed for hiding. On the bed i see my powerpoint presentation-remote, with built in laser-dot. God bless.

Here kitty kitty. 
The predator sees its prey and leaps. The uncatchable prey made of photons takes its escape into the restroom, the dripping beast follows - into the shower and boom. The cat is locked in behind doors of glass. Finally. Time stops.


As i look down i see the sad face of a cat behind the glass door. I see pee in the entire restroom, a wet trail leading out to the middle of the living room where, judging by the formation and consentration of drops, most of it were shaken off, yet a small trail, initially accompanied by fading paw prints, goes a few laps around the room.

I burst into laughter, grab a rag and start the clean up. 



TL;DR
Curious cat puts his head in my pee-beam, gets soaked and in panic running around all over the place, sprinkling my apartment in pee. As i try to catch him i scare him up, making it all worse until i lure him back into the restroom with a laserpointer.

"TIFU by thinking I was dying and scheduled a colonoscopy. (NSFW?)


This actually happened a fortnight ago (it's kind of gross, and the rules stated that bodily discharge-related stories should wait until the weekend, so... I also tagged it as NSFW just in case it's too gross. Better safe than sorry?), so I've been in panic-mode every since.

A week or so ago I went to the toilet in the morning for my regular... y'know, bowel movement, and after standing up I looked down into the bowl and saw what can only be described as A BLOODY NIGHTMARE. It looked like someone had been murdered in the toilet. Like, there was blood. Red coloured water all swirling around in the bowl. Cue the start of my panic and stress. I decided to give it a few days and see if it happened again, and low and behold it happened the next day as well.

It was my day off the following day, so I planned to see a doctor, but that morning every seemed fine. Totally normal. No scene straight out of a horror movie in my toilet bowl. The week went on, and bam, it happened again. I went to the doctor. Totally, completely stressed. My doctor ordered a colonoscopy and I began the long process of working myself up into a state of stress.

Yesterday (four days before the colonoscopy), I was at work when I suddenly realised what I'd eaten the day before the first incident. BEETS. FUCKING BEETS. The thing is, beets aren't common at all in the country I live in, so I haven't had much experience with them recently. I ate a beet salad, holy shit! And after that beet salad I'd enjoyed them so much that I bought more beets from the supermarket. I was so happy with my beets.

I bought more beets yesterday and ate them, and yeah... it happened again. Now I probably have a stress ulcer from thinking and panicking about it constantly.

SO JUST A NOTE TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS BEETS - PLEASE DON'T FREAK OUT IF YOU NOTICE WHAT SEEMS TO BE BLOOD IN THE TOILET. IT COULD JUST BE THE DAMN BEETS.

Sidenote: I also had to go back to the doctor's office and explain what might have happened, so that was a fun and not at all embarrassing trip. The receptionist looked at me like I was a total idiot. Which I am.

TL;DR: I ate beets and didn't realise the dye would colour your poo, thought I was bleeding, freaked out, scheduled a colonoscopy, wept."
"Tifu by throwing a cigarette butt into some horse shit


Well this was actually last night but still worth posting. So here's some background. I live in the city so I'm not used to how dry everything is out in the desert where my mom lives. I went out to visit her for a few days to help clean up the horse pens and get her horses ready to be moved. She has a space set aside for all of the horse crap to go until it piles up then she has a tractor come to move it all at once.

 So I'm out there cleaning the round pen and I stopped to take a much needed cigarette break. After I'm done without thinking I flick the cigarette into the pile of dried out horse shit and get back to work. I finish up and go inside for some dinner and then go to bed. 
 
 The next morning  I woke up(being about 45 minutes ago) and went out to smoke another cigarette. I'm standing out front and I smell smoke. ""Who's BBQing at 4:30 in the morning"" I thought. And then I thought ""god that smells like shit, like litteral shit"" that's when it hit me that maybe it's coming from the backyard. So I went back there and sure enough 2 tons of horse shit is in a firey blaze smoke everywhere. So I spent the next 30 minutes spraying water on it and shoveling it around to put it out. 

 Long story short, don't throw cigarette butts into dry horse shit.

 TL;DR I threw a cigarette into some horse shit and almost burned my mom's house down"
"TIFU by taking the wrong medication


My life is full of fuck ups so I figure I would post another one on here. Obligatory this happened ten years ago when I was in high school.

I've had a problem with chronic migraines my entire life and occasionally before school I would take a dose of fioricet (basically a pain killer with caffeine used for migraines) and head to school pain free. I was up all night playing PS3 and only got a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My head was throbbing so I took my meds and drove to class. The teacher started her lesson when I realized I left my textbook in my car. I excused myself and walked towards my vehicle, and grabbed my book. 

Next thing I remember is waking up in the middle of the front office handcuffed to a chair. Belligerently mumbling and trying to rip myself out of the chair. I thought the security guard was attacking me and I began to scream and kick my feet at him. He started yelling in my ear ""What did you take, what drugs are you on?!. All I remember is yelling ""Fuck you, get me out of this fucking chair"". I stood up dragging the chair behind me as I tried to leave out the front door of the office. He grabbed me and stuck me in the principals office and stood in front of the door. They went out and started searching my car for drugs. He came in with my pipe and put it on the desk. An ambulance got called and they drove me to the hospital to have my stomach pumped. 

Fast forward to the hospital, they got me in the bed and have hooked up a bag of saline to flush the drugs out of my system. Out of no where I snapped back into reality. I started asking why the hell I was at the hospital when my mom showed up with a couple pill bottles. She counted them out and they realized that I had taken an ambien in my sleepy stupor instead of my migraine medicine. The ambien kicked in at the exact time I had grabbed my books. 

Next day at school, I was called into the principals office to discuss the incident. I was fully ready to be expelled but he was really cool about it. The conversation went like this 

""I'm just happy your alive, I have never seen someone try to fight a security guard. You know we found you standing in the middle of the parking lot with your book in your hand just staring at your car""

All I had to do was write a written apology to the security guard. He laughed about it and every time he saw me he'd be like ""woah watch out man, don't kick me alright?!""

TLDR : Wrong meds turned me into a ninja"
