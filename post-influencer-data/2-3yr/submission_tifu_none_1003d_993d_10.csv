"TIFU by giving a homeless guy $80


Preface: 
*Not trolling for money, thanks* 


So I'm a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I'm broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I'm working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best ""screw up"" ever, I suppose. I'll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.

Happy Holidays guy.

Edit: to whoever gave the gold... I'm so inexperienced with Reddit I had to look up what it even was. haha. Wow. Really didn't expect much response at all I'm honored. Thank you kindly."
"TIFU taking Reddits advice.


This happened last weekend, my parents were out of town and I was reading [this AskReddit thread when I got to this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5i5csd/what_is_your_i_know_it_sounds_weird_but_just_try/db5p4bk/) I realized I had one of these in my house but haven't used it for years. So I went upstairs, [got out the 1990's version of this contraption](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Teeter-EP-560-Inversion-Table-with-Back-Pain-Relief-DVD/23222244?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=3760&amp;adid=22222222227017193045&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=52308893535&amp;wl4=pla-79410631695&amp;wl5=9021618&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=113499840&amp;wl11=online&amp;wl12=23222244&amp;wl13=&amp;veh=sem), strapped myself in, and started to recline. The thing flipped me over pretty fast and locked in place, completely vertical. At first it felt really good, my lower back cracked in places it hadn't before, but since I was completely upside down, blood started to rush to my head quickly and soon it was time to flip back up. This is when I realized that I didn't know how to come back up, I was seriously locked in place upside down, hanging by my ankles. I struggled for a few minutes trying different ways to escape this contraption, but I couldn't do it. Then I started to panic, I'm thinking to myself how my embarrassing its gonna be when I die this way. Eventually after hanging upside down for a way too long, I decide enough is enough. I sat up, so I could reach my feet and yanked on the little spring loaded knob that was holding my feet in place. It popped open and I fell onto the hardwood floor, with all my weight, on my neck. Now my neck is fucked up, but at least I didn't die taking advice from Reddit.

TLDR: I tried to stretch out my back and ended up destroying my neck."

"TIFU by going home with young lass after a night of heavy drinking


Obligatory this wasn't actually today, but during my sophomore year as a newly initiated fraternity guy with a large ego and small alcohol tolerance. I've had to use a throwaway because this story (and the unfortunate pictures that go along with it) got pretty popular around my college and people will likely recognize the story.

We start out the night at the liquor store where one of my older fraternity brothers offers to buy me some booze if I buy him a six pack. Being around the age of 19, this was usually my only way to get booze for a party so I obliged. I had about $15 after his 6 pack of PBR, and as I was reaching for a 12 pack of Miller Lite, I see a neon sign warning me of their new special on boxed wine. I do a little mental math and realize I can get 5 whole liters of shitty wine for the same price as a 12-pack of beer. Impressed with my price per unit reasoning, I go with the bag of wine instead.

The night proceeds how you probably guessed it would for any 19 year old armed with 5L of wine and little to no experience with binge drinking. I drink about 3L of it and i'm spewing out of all ends as we leave the house party we were at. My friends were trying to drag me home but I wanted to stay. I am now drenched in shitty wine, and rolling around in the grass so my friends just fucking leave me there. Can you really blame them? 

I gained a second wind and somehow ended back up at the party, still covered in boxed wine and other juices I couldn't point out from rolling around the damp yard outside of a college apartment complex on a Friday night.

**Cue the young lass.**

Some backstory on her: She was a nice girl, but really really not my type and had been aggressively pursuing me all last year for a piece of the 5 inch prince but I wasn't really interested. Things changed on this night. 

She walked into the party and screamed when she saw me and came over and hugged me, ignored my dampness, and then sat down next to me at the party. Things progress and we're eventually making out and she's leading me away from the party towards her apartment.

She pretty much has to drag my toes up the stairs and then leads me into her lair to mate with me. She goes to the restroom and I strip down to my skivvies and slip into her bed to wait on what is to come. She returns from the bathroom and we start to do the kissing. 

After some light kissing and caressing of the 5 inch grinch she freaks the fuck out and screams at me to stop. I'm totally surprised at her total shift in mood, and was incredibly confused until she yelled at me to stop pissing in her bed. Sure enough, I look down and I have broke the levees all over her nice silk sheets. She's freaking the fuck out and me and pushing me out of her bed, and immediately pushes me into her restroom buck naked to finish pissing. I pretty much got it all out of my system on her 1000-thread count sheets but I figure i'll go along with the charade to keep up appearances. 

I sit down on the toilet, and that's all I remember until my 6'3 275 lb friend has to kick down the door to find me naked passed out on the toilet seat with my head resting on her counter. The girl had left her apartment after she couldn't get me to leave her bathroom and went back to the party and refused to deal with me (for good reason.)

I woke up the next morning in her apartment on the couch, in underwear that weren't mine, and her roommates (who I was still a stranger to) were giving me the worst glares of all time. I also reeked. Why, you ask? It wasn't the fact I was covered in cheap wine or my own urine. When I passed out naked on her toilet, I apparently decided to take a shit and neglected to wipe.

Don't be like me.

TLDR; Drank too much, went home with a girl, peed all over her and her expensive sheets, passed out in her bathroom, my friend had to come kick in the door to make sure I was alive, forgot rudimentary procedures while pooping."
"TIFU losing 3 pints of blood by sitting a steamless wine glass AND getting 300 stiches in my nose.


Warning it may get a little graphic.

Like the title states... had a few glasses of wine on Friday night and I wanted to play me some late night video games. Well got up glass in hand and put it down on couch and ran to the bathroom. Came back and sat right on the glass... Shattered the glass.  Total cut was about 5 cm wide and very deep. Yelled to my fiance to call the ambulance. It was a god damn blood bath. Almost hit an artery and my rectum... just barely missed. Thank god it could of been a lot worse. Over all avout 3 pints of blood were scattered around my house 

Speaking of worse. They stablized the bleeding in the ER on my ass and I was sent to a room for the night because I was scheduled for a rectalcolonospopy. I would be knocked out for it so not too bad. Could have even be released on Sunday! I kn9w I would be the butt of all the jokes...

Thats when I decided I needed to pee. looking back probably not my finest idea. I stood up and next thing I recall is being on the floor in a puddle of blood yelling for help. I must of lost conciousness when I stood up. I guess my nose wanted to get to get better aquanted with the floor. I wasnt scheduled as a fall risk ( 30s and healthy) but losing so much blood I should have been. I completely smashed my entire nasal cavity and spent 3 hours in surgery to repair both my nose and my ass... over 300 stiches inside my nose and upper lip. Not sure on my butt... all this because of a god damn wine glass. Really fucked up. 

Couldnt really link and tell story on my phone but proof of nose 

https://sli.mg/vydIT7 ... you'll have to take my word on the ass. 

**Edit:** Sorry for the title gore and spelling. I promise I do know how to spell. I kept the spelling shitty because I was/still am under heavy meds and on a tiny phone. I can fix it when I get on a computer. 

Some guy said the story is BS... added one more pic because this shit hurts https://sli.mg/lrX6mt"
"TIFU by getting fired as a volunteer Santa


I offered to volunteer as Santa once a week over Christmas. All I had to do was listen to the kids and hand them a present. One mother fucker ran at me and tried to jump in my lap. His feet landed directly on my balls.

I immediately bolted up grabbing my dick, the kid fell backwords over the chair and chipped his tooth. I slipped and fell on one of the fake reindeer and crushed it.

The kid is bawling. Some others in line start crying. I'm told to go home. As I walk out two women hit me with purses. And a father pushed me and told me he will ""Fuck everbody I love"".

The worst part is I had a drink with my friend before and forgot gum for my breath.  So I was ultimately fired because they thought I was drunk.

**Note**

There is a video. 
I'll be in touch soon about the clip! Thanks for the offers! Part of the issue is the video is over 20 minutes long, my friend was there taping his relatives. So a lot needs to be erased. And I'm finishing my teaching work term (yes I will soon be a teacher). So I can't have some of the faces of the kids I teach etc. in it. Or I feel like I shouldn't. 

Also, in regard to the drink. It was one beer and a burger I bought with a gift card. Relax! Ha

And should I post the video here? Or make a new post once I have it?

Love Santa"
"TIFU by giving my girlfriend a concussion.


2013

I was delivering pizzas during my final year of college.  It was the Friday right before winter break.  Most of the students had gone home already.  I was working a little that weekend and would head home in a couple days, or that was the plan anyway.

It was also one of the shittiest, coldest, iciest winters Michigan has ever seen.  I feel like I say that every year, but this one sticks out to me.

You see where this is going.  

It's about 8pm, very dark.  I'm delivering to the northern bordering town, so nowhere really near campus, and there are no street lights on this freeway.  The road is empty, which ended up being a good and a bad thing.  

It wasn't snowing, and there wasn't any snow on the ground, so it never occurred to me that there was a shit load of ice everywhere.  I was going about 60mph when I caught some black ice, spun out, and I remember this clear as fucking day.  As I'm spinning towards this guard rail, right before impact, I calmly mutter ""fuck.""

It was fucking lights out.  I'll never really know how long I was out for, I'm guessing maybe 10-15 minutes or so.  I remember coming to and being completely fucking delirious.  I shouted out my two younger brothers' names to make sure they were ok, but of course they weren't with me.  Then I yelled my girlfriend at the time's name, same thing.

Then I looked down at my bloody pizza shirt, and then it hit me.  I wasn't drunk.  I was delivering pizza to some poor hungry guy that isn't eating tonight, unless he wanted my mangled face goo all over it.

All of that took about another 20 minutes for me to realize what happened and to pull myself out of this thing that used to be a car.

I hobble onto the freeway and just start walking aimlessly.  I'm still pretty wasted from the impact, but I have no idea how I'm walking right now.  I just know that I need to get to a hospital.  Must have been the adrenaline.  Also I was wearing boots, like tight laced boots, and they were both missing, as if they had been thrown off.  I never found them.

Honestly, as soon as I got up, I saw headlights.  I ran my torn up zombie looking ass self to the middle of the road, which was probably real stupid too, and flagged this guy down.  He took one look at me and said ""holy shit dude, get in.""

I sat down, called my brother off of this guy's phone, but I couldn't remember his number for the longest time.  I was loopy from the head impact.  Finally got in touch with him, told him to tell mom and dad and my girlfriend, to let them know what happened.  Then the pain finally set in.  I had my affairs in order, and now my body decided to betray me in the worst most painful way.

Once flushed with adrenaline, I was rendered useless and motionless by the time we reached the hospital.  I had to be carried very carefully, as they thought I might have had a broken neck.  The right side of my face was so swollen and my right ear was bleeding from the inside.

I'm lying on this hospital bed, and then I get the pain meds.  I kinda nod in and out, and then I see my girlfriend come in the operating room or wherever I was.  She takes one look at me, I'm high as fuck at this point, I go ""whatsup dude,"" and giver her a wink, and she faints and slams her head on the floor.

I wake up later about an hour away, they were going to airlift me but instead opted for an ambulance to take me to another hospital that had a trauma center.  I was apparently really fucked up, internally bleeding, but somehow managed to not break a single bone.

I'm really sore, can't move, have a pencil width tube in my cock hole, and I look over and my girlfriend is sleeping on this shitty chair beside me.  

Doctor comes in almost right after I woke up, told me what happened and that I should be dead as fuck.  I mean, he really hammered that point home.  Said he'd never seen anyone survive a crash like that, let alone not break anything or have any major injuries.  I was just in so much pain.  He told me something along the lines of ""you must have a guardian angel,"" as he checked my catheter and saw my darwin fish tattoo on my thigh.  awkward...

I took a moment to myself, sobered up a bit, and had a little cry to myself after my brush with death.  The pictures of my car are pretty awful to look at.  The entire right side of it was completely smashed in from the guard rail, leaving just inches for me to fit.  Looking at it I have no idea where I fit myself.

I suffered from dizzy spells and extreme pain and anxiety for about 6 months, and didn't drive for like a year, but I'm all better now.  My jaw clicks a lot, that's all.

Anyway, my girlfriend got a concussion and it was all my fault.  She decided to marry me though so that's dope.

TL;DR

got mangled in a car wreck, girlfriend saw me on the operating table, fainted, now we're getting married.  got a newer, better pair of boots.  swag bitch.

"Tifu by drowning the company car


[Update] Sorry this is later coming out than I wanted. I have been on conference calls much of the day. The car does not start, but the mechanic thinks it can once he finds the fault. Probably water in the motor. Company policy has changed regarding driving during the night. We wrote a incident report, attached photos, and sent that in. That actually went over well and at least some people understood our thought process. Not fired for now. Thanks (most) everybody for the advice, well wishes, and chuckles.



So I was driving a developmental car on a predetermined route. These cars are not cheap, R&amp;amp;D cars doubly more so. The route has us take a road behind some houses. It is dark and had been raining. The road is not great and I am driving slow. There is a big puddle in front of me. My coworker and I get out, it looks like it isn't too deep, maybe to the undercarriage. Yeah it was more than that. The motor dies which takes electric down.  Bye bye breaks. I quickly put on the e-break but by then it was too late. Coworker gets out to push it back. Yeah not happening. Water is maybe knee high and by now the whole car is flooded. We were able to push it far enough that the engine compartment was out of the water, but all electronics were down. I am writing this as we wait for the tow truck. I am so fired.

Edit update: Thanks for the kind words. Since it is the weekend a mechanic from the company will look at it on Monday. Decisions will be made then. As for the spelling errors above I will leave them, but please know I am on mobile with autocorrect and was a bit emotional at the time (I still might be). Sorry I can't include pictures. I would be fired for sure then. "
"TIFU by kicking a child in the face whilst on the toilet...


Reddit, today (yes really today) I fucked up. I work on retail and unfortunately that means public restrooms. Now, as everyone knows, you do not tell the asshole how to do his job.....when he says time to go it's time to go. Now as I sit down for a relieving session I hear a couple of unaccompanied youths enter....they begin pulling hands full of towels, randomly flushing toilets and turning sink on. I don't care, not my job to care.
     
   Next one of the little shits (the kids....) bends and pops his head underneath the stall I am currently conducting business in, I simply give an inquisitive ""the fuck dude?"" and he sniggered and got away, guessing his buddy had to one up him and poked his head under, waved and greeted me.

Here is where I should pause to add, I've been seriously in a shitty mood lately...Due to life and the trials that come with it and I'm known to be a bit of an ass. I put my foot his forehead, and pushed him away (some, apparently call this a kick to a little kids face... Not me but some). This causes him to stumble and jerk away to try to catch himself, smashing his face in the wall causing a massive nose bleed......FUCK.

spent a few hours with management in conversation with HR and thought I would suffer some bad consequences (mom was not happy with me ""kicking"" her snowflake) but worked out in the end, management finally saw my side after they took time to hear me out....

Tl;dr kicked a kid in the face, made him bleed....Got away scott free"

"TIFU By eating a kiwi fruit, skin and all.


Yesterday, I was browsing /r/AskReddit, when I came across [this little gem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5i5csd/what_is_your_i_know_it_sounds_weird_but_just_try/db5hj8y/) So just about thirty minutes ago, I went into the kitchen, where we just so happened to have a few kiwi fruits, ripe for the taking. 

Que fuckup. 

I washed it, took a bite of it, and enjoyed every bit of it. Up until I finished the fruit, at which point I noticed that my tongue started burning, then stinging, all coming from the hairs on the fruit. Next thing I knew, I was over the kitchen sink, letting water pour into my mouth. It still burns. I'm here typing this with a burning sensation on my tongue, I hope it's not permanent.

TL;DR: Tiny hairs poked my taste-tentacle, now it burns.

EDIT:~~Obligatory~~ Huh, i posted this and went to sleep, next thing i know, i got my front page cherry popped. Thanks, /u/charlychuckle! I'm glad so many of you got enjoyment out of my misfortune. Now i know that I'm allergic to the skin of a kiwi fruit. I will now proceed to reply to most comments.

I'm also leaving Que there.

Alright, alright, i get it, I'm allergic to the nutsack of the gods. And no, i don't have problems with latex."
"TIFU by not mentioning my gender online


Actually goes quite some way back, but here goes: When I get to make a character online, I went for females. Now, before you ask, yes I am male, and no I am not making these characters due to my rampant homosexual desires or my suppressed desire to be another gender. It was simply because I felt that in games, men were portrayed as 'powerful', and women were portrayed at 'beautiful'. I never liked projecting myself onto the characters, and the male body seemed unappealing and over-bulked, so instead I'd spend my time making some barbie doll look nicer, if anything. You are permitted to laugh.

Regardless, I never had the intent to catfish anyone. I did do the occasional Role Play, but when it came down to everyone's identity, I easily confessed I was a guy playing the girl ""cause the curves are nice"". Hardly ever gotten any problems with this. Heck, it's still a common joke among a few of my friends.

However, this all changed when ~~the outdated joke attacked~~ I started playing a game called Uncharted Waters Online. Was a weird game, but I got to be in a ship. Being a captain was good fun, and I still sail to this day, albeit in actual ships now. Once again a female character, but I saw no harm. A bit of socializing here and a few broadsides there caused me to get a nice circle of friends going inside the game. However, one friend I made was a bit weirder at the time.

As someone who has been to and lived in quite a bit Asia before, I was happy to gain a friend in China. The guy was civil and friendly, if not a bit somber. Apparently in a rough patch in his field of study, and he felt like he didn't know what his next steps are. Naturally, as the 'sunshine in the room' (read: obnoxiously optimistic) I was all to happy to chat with him about his life and skills. Here is where the real fuck up happened. It was so normal for me to mention early into knowing someone that I was actually male, that when I talking these deep conversations with my Chinese Friend (who I will name Ling for convenience) I forgot I hadn't mentioned it. Now, a lot of people will follow the mantra ""There are no girls on the internet unless proven otherwise"", but the same could not be said for Ling.

Our friendship lasted for nearly half a year, with me knowing a lot about him and his life. When he asked about where I lived or what I did, I generally said I lived in some city in Germany. Technically, I wasn't too far off, since I lived in the Netherlands close to the border. I visited the town not too infrequently, so I knew my details. If in the end I wanted to meet someone in real life, those extra km wouldn't matter, but if the person tried to hunt me down, they'd never think to look across the border. To be fair, I think the fact that I didn't want anyone to know my personal details combined with the fact that I actually wanted to help him with his personal problems, caused this situation to escalate. Talking so little about myself allowed half a year to pass without either realizing the mistaken gender assumption.

Now at this point, I realized: He didn't think I was male. He honestly believed I was female. I don't know at which point I had my first suspicion, but I was sure of my case when he started sending me messages involving his reproductive system, my *obviously* humid reproductive system, and whatever happens when you throw those two together. Here I made my second big mistake. I back-pedaled, but I simply mentioned that I wasn't comfortable discussing such topics. I didn't mention I was male. I was deeply afraid that if he realized that his virtual crush was another guy, I'd undo all the confidence and progress I made on his life. So I played the part and tried to bring the heat down a few notches. Tried to untangle myself from the web, after which I'd vanish from his life, leaving behind a better man.

Until, at one point, Ling was convinced: I must have been some angel sent from heaven to guide him to the better path. Having heard of the German education system (which honestly is pretty sweet), he was convinced that he should move to Germany. Naturally, close where I was living. He knew I wasn't of age, but he was sure that we could at least get to know each other better until I was. After which, we would get married and he would take care of me until the end of days.

Sounds like a perfect plan, right? He had it all worked out. Despite his problems with his education, he never really had any problems with money. I was honestly convinced that in his eyes, he would do me a favor. The problem was unfortunately that I wasn't who he hoped I was. Where before I was slowly backing away, now I was running away screaming. Technically, at that point, I could have mentioned my gender, but I was stupid enough to hope that if I could make him calm down for now, I might find a better time to tell him, to make it less crushing. I flatly refused to tell him my address when he asked me, telling him I did not feel comfortable at all with such an extreme step. He told me he had patience, and would wait for me as long as I needed.

Here my second habit at the time came in handy. My father was a huge stickler for internet security. Having worked companies with rather strict NDAs, he had to make sure that there were no data leaks. He had me take up the habit of putting all personal data on a secondary hard drive. I can leave it near my PC, but don't plug it in unless I am going to transfer data, and always check your PC for viruses before you do. Don't leave any personal data on your PC if you don't immediately need it. His advise was ""Long term infection is rare. You'd need to ignore all the warning signs and payloads, and also actively ignore your anti-virus. The real danger are the ones which operate in a human's reflex time. A virus can do many things between the moment you downloaded it and the moment you realize it. Don't assume you are immune, because nobody is."" So I never kept data linking to myself on my PC.

As you can guess from my previous explanation, Ling tried to hijack my data from my PC. He was a software engineer, and in the half year I knew him, it wasn't uncommon for me to look at his programs he made and discuss them. So when he sent me a program after the incident, I thought it was his way of making up. When I ran it, I recognized the warning signs pretty quickly: He was taking every document and picture, and trying to download it all to his PC, just to find some personal information. However, there was almost nothing. Just a school report and some pictures of the game. But my name was under the school report. My name which happens to sound particularly non-female. Oh, and the report was in Dutch.

I wish shit had hit the fan right then and there, but it didn't. He didn't even seemed upset at first, and just asked an explanation. I explained my case, mentioning that it was originally never my intent to hide my gender from him. But he understood now. He had apparently gotten my IP already in the past, but thought I was operating through a proxy. After all, my IP was Dutch, yet I said I was German. He was desperate to find some way to trace me, or he wouldn't have used a virus. But with the IP and my name, he knew enough now. He said the sweetest yet scariest thing I had ever heard from a stranger:

""I honestly don't care how you look, how old you are, or even what your gender is. I didn't fall in love with your body, but with your mind. My love is not so fickle that I would not accept you knowing this. We can still get married in the Netherlands anyhow, so it's not as if the law will stop us.""

His tickets to Germany was set. All he had to do is book a bus to the Netherlands. I begged him not to fly, that I would not have a life with him. He told me he didn't care, he had to be with me anyways. I told him I'd go to the police if he didn't stop. He asked me to meet me half way then, somewhere in Germany. I asked him not to contact me anymore. He told me I'd change my mind once we met face to face.

The flight date came, but he never showed up. I had informed the police, and they were so kind to keep a look out for an Asian man of his description, but somehow I think he never made that flight. I think moments before the flight date, he realized the misery he was causing me, and just stopped his plans. He hadn't come online ever since. Some parts of me are glad, but some parts of me wonder if he's OK now. Maybe he actually is studying happily in Germany, and some day I'll get a mail from him, and we can laugh about all this and split ways again.

**TLDR: Accidentally catfished a stranger, who then became determined to meet and marry me. When I told him I was a boy, he told me he didn't care.**"
"TIFU by slitting my wrists for a cookie


Like all TIFU's, this happened a couple of years ago when I was in high school. In was in French class and there was a substitute, so every body was on their phones. My friend,(we'll call him Billy) had a mom who baked the tastiest sugar cookies, and he had pulled them out. I said to him, ""yo, can I get a cookie?"" Billy said ""Ha no their mine."". Now, when I said those cookies were tasty, I meant it. Mouth watering cookies, so I said, ""I'll do anything bro."". So him, being the sadist he is, told me he would give me the entire bag if i slashed my wrists with scissors. I said hell no, but he double dog dared me, and I'm not a pussy, so I said fine. I walked up behind the sub and grabbed the sharpest scissors there. I walked back to my seat and this is where the fuck up happened. Instead of doing it myself, I let Billy do it. He pushed down on my wrists and dragged it across. I shouted ""FUCK""  and the sub came running to see what happened, only to see bloodied scissors and me on the floor. The sub panicked and ran to the office and a couple minutes later the ambulance came. They took me to the hospital, and told me I was 2 inches away from slashing my arteries. I then had to explain to my parents what happened.


tl;dr i cut my wrists for some cookies and almost died

So last night my gf got a new dildo in the mail. It's her first one, and I've never seen one in person before. It's one of those suction cup dildos that you can stick on the wall or wherever. I decided to test it out, and being the 12-year-old I am, I stuck it right in the middle of my forehead. I was the glorious and rare Dildicorn! I thought it was so hilarious, and I even took photos. She didn't think it was as funny, so she pulled it off my head. Well good news: the suction cup works great! Now I have this HUGE bruise right in the middle of my forehead! This was like 14 hours ago, and it's still there! Now I have to avoid explaining to my coworkers why there's a hickey in the middle of my forehead.

TL;DR - got a forehead hickey from a dildo.
