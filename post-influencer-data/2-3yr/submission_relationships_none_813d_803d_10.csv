We've been solid for the past few months. He was the one who asked if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. We had some issues but always talked them out- he was nervous when I went overseas on vacation, has been paranoid about me cheating on him. He's been drinking a lot, and got a little obsessed with a video game, but otherwise was fine until a couple of weeks ago when his bag was stolen from his gym locker. It really hurt him, he was bummed out because he had a few sentimental items in it, and altogether it's always a violating experience to be robbed.

As per his request, I let him have his space to work it out, after comforting him/helping him do things like dropping him off at the DMV to replace his lost licence, etc. I felt a little alienated from him, but over the past week he seemed to get better, once his life was getting back to normal. I've been busy with school work, but we talked every day, hung out regularly.

This past Monday was my birthday, and he was great. He surprised me with a cake at my house, took me out for dinner yesterday, bought me three more surprise gifts. I felt close to him again, and it was wonderful. We live about an hour apart from each other and I'm in school/he works full time, so it was another couple of days until we saw each other. Last night, he went out with some friends like he usually does, I stayed in with a toothache and fell asleep early. The last text I got from him was him hanging out with buddies from work.

Today, we had plans for me to go to his place to do a goofy date where we celebrated his video game achievements, but he switched venues to mine at the last second because he had work done on his bathroom and he said he didn't want me to not have a place to shower. I was excited to see him regardless, so I said we could hang out at my place and have a cuddle night in.

He got there while I was on a run, and let himself in to hang out until I got there. When we went up to my room, he had put one of my surprise belated birthday gifts- a shirt- on top of a pile of clothes, played a little game where he asked me what was different about my room. I was really excited, and he asked me to try it on to see if it fit. After I kissed him to say thank you, he got a serious look on his face and said that he wanted to talk about something.

Out of nowhere, he said that he didn't think he could be in a relationship. We're lying on my bed at this point, I'm sweaty from my run and wearing the new shirt, completely shocked. He says that he's depressed, and that he thinks he's not over his ex- a woman who he's only described as crazy and abusive to me- she used to hit him. He talks about how he feels he's escaping into video games and drinking (which I agree with), and that he's just not happy. I immediately sit up and say that I understand- I'm hurt, but his feelings are valid and I care about him, so I listened to him vent for awhile longer, thinking about how to cope with the rest of the night.

He mentions that while he was out last night, he ran into an ex (not the one he said he was hung up on, the ""rebound""), and they started talking about why things didn't work out between them. He explained to me in detail what had happened between them- that she wanted a relationship and he didn't, and she had ended things. The detail is what got to me, the amount of thought he had put into it, how their conversation must have gone, how drunk he was...And it clicked that he probably had cheated on me. 

I knew he might, based on the heavy drinking he was doing- it felt like a time bomb until he did something destructive, and I had said as much. He started talking about all of the things he was paranoid about in our relationship, like the fact that I was still friends with my ex and his family on facebook, how he was afraid I would move away when I finished my degree, etc. He said that he wanted to cuddle with me, and that he was really hungover. He says he wishes I would hit him or get angry, and I recoil, saying I would never do that and I still cared about him, I wouldn't be angry over him not feeling like he could be in a relationship.

At this point I have no idea which end is up, aside from the fact that I didn't want him in my house anymore. We talk a little bit about the nature of break-ups, and I say I'd still be interested in being friends- which is true, he says passive-aggressively: ""until you get a new boyfriend"", I say ""yeah, or until you get a new girlfriend, that's usually how it goes"". I'm sitting up in the bed, trying to get him to move the conversation outside, and he is lying in my bed and just all over the place- talking about how he'll never meet anyone as good as me, how he's sorry, how he hasn't been good to me. I ask point blank if he cheated and he says no. He talks about the handmade gifts that were arriving soon for my birthday. I say that I'm not sure what he's doing, but I'm not interested in a boomerang relationship- my parents split up constantly as I was growing up, and it was always miserable for them both- and then I said if he had started with the issues he was having instead of saying he didn't want to be with me, it might have been a different story. I tell him I think it's best if he leaves, and he asks if we can watch a tv show that we've been watching together throughout the relationship- I say I don't think it's appropriate. I give him back a sweatshirt he left me, and we go downstairs. He says he feels like getting wasted or playing the video game, I don't say anything. He asks for a hug before he leaves, and I give him a quick, friendly one, and he stares at me for a long minute before he leaves.

I have been reeling from this. I was half-prepared for awhile now for something to happen, because of the way he was drinking, but he said he wanted to work on it, and I trusted him. The outpouring of emotions and blow hot, blow cold weirdness on his end made me feel shocked- and I still feel that way, eight hours later. I've told my friends, and my mom, I've been working on homework and doing chores, doing everything to keep my mind off of it. I blocked him on most social media. He texted me awhile ago, thanking me for being understanding, saying he felt like I knew what he was going through, apologizing for being unhappy. He says he wished he had more energy to put into being with me, and that I deserve better than him, and that he wishes he was as emotionally strong as I was. Then he said he wished the timing was perfect because I'm an amazing person.

He texted me again, saying that he still has some of my things, and he would bring them to me when my presents came in the mail so I wouldn't have to drive to pick them up. I told him no worries, that I enjoyed being with him, and that I hoped he found the happiness he was looking for. I then said we could meet up later on in the summer, that he was good to me, and that there's no bad blood on my end.

And there truly isn't, I've thought about it at length. We had a good relationship, I felt cared for, and I enjoyed spending the time that I did with him. This break up, though- his chaotic emotions, and strange behaviors- have really thrown me for a loop. I'm not sure whether he did drugs last night, or was still drunk, or cheated on me and felt guilty- maybe all three. But I just needed to get all of this out there instead of internalizing the weirdness, because I don't think there's any way to make sense of it, and dwelling on it isn't going to be productive. It's just so confusing because I haven't seen him act in such an unstable way before, and all of these issues must have been piling up for him for so long. 

So, that's my story. I'd like to start up a friendship with him after some time has passed, but I'm worried, based on his mental state, that it might not be healthy- I'd love some input on what to do next.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend broke up with me suddenly, maybe high, maybe drunk, maybe cheated, definitely bizarre. I'd love some advice on how to cope/ what my role should be in the coming months.

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all around for the wise words, helpful critiques and overall support. No contact has been implemented for the first 24 hour stretch, and I spent the day with two of my friends at the state fair, riding roller coasters and drinking lemonade and such (sometimes fun is the best mood reset button :)), who promised to come with me to get my stuff back when I'm ready in the next few weeks (I'm planning on waiting in the car). 

Coming back to see this was beyond heartwarming. I'll go through as many comments as I can before bed, and I hope that your days were as great as you helped mine to be &lt;3 "

Original post here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6h0hrl/27f_im_engaged_to_44m_and_my_best_friend_of_3/

 SO. I didn't get a crazy amount of attention on my last post but I still decided it deserved an update nonetheless. I'd like to thank you all for your comments, they really helped.

 First, I spoke to Burke that night. He came home from work and before he got too comfy I told him we needed to talk and then we sat down and spoke. I started by telling him about the start of mine and Trevors relationship because he didn't know how our friendship began. I then told him about how he confessed to being in love with me and how I have 0 feelings for him, I love Burke and only Burke and he's the man I'm going to marry.

 Burke didn't look too surprised. He said he had a feeling that something like this was going to happen because everytime Trevor, Burke and I are in the same general area Trevor always has this look on his face and seems annoyed and aggitated in general. He always assumed Trevor was salty about our relationship together. Apparently its common gossip around the workplace that ""Trevor wants a piece of Burkes woman""

 Burke also told me that he's kind of glad this happened in a way because part of him always worried that I had feelings for Trevor or was going to leave him for Trevor because Trevor is a bit closer to my age than he is.

 I messaged Trevor and told him that there was no ""choice"" and that I love Burke and I'm getting married to him next month. Trevor left me on ""read"" and removed me from FB almost immediately afterwards. I've seen him out in public a few times here and there but we never spoke, he wouldn't even look at me. 

 After about a week or two he texted me and told me that he's sorry things had to come to this, he was almost 100% certain that I still had feelings for him and that this was going to have a different ending. He told me he's kicking himself in the ass for dicking me around in the past and missing out on his chance with me, and told me if I changed my mind I know how to contact him. I never replied.

  I feel closer to my fiancee more than ever and we've both decided to try for a baby :) I've been thinking of asking Burke about starting a family for a while now but I wanted to wait until after the wedding so I wasn't trying to squeeze my pregnant belly into a wedding dress, and apparently he was having the same thoughts as I was.. I took my last BCP on Saturday and we've both been really busy putting in some last minute wedding plans and trying to make a baby.

 Thanks for your help Reddit! A piece of me still feels hollow because I just lost my best friend of 5 years and part of me wishes there was a different outcome, where I could have both my man and my bestie in my life and things could go back to the way they used to be but I know that's impossible. But I'll be okay in the end. I wish I could invite you all to the wedding but sadly we're already full. &lt;3

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Told my fiancee that my best friend confessed to being in love with me, my fiancee wasn't surprised because he had his suspicions all along. My best friend is on longer in my life, I'm upset about that but I'll be okay. I'm getting married in 3 weeks and my fiancee and I are also trying for a baby. "

"My [35F] SIL [25F] planned a birthday party for her kids on my daughter's [6F] birthday. Should I ask if we can make it my daughter's birthday too?


We have a tight knit family, at least on my husband's side, and have three cousins with birthdays within a week of each other: my daughter and her two cousins (siblings, 1 &amp; 3). A couple of years ago, the grandparents threw a joint birthday. Last year SIL didn't do anything because she was on bedrest, so only I threw a party.

This year, I had planned to ask if she wanted to do a joint party. The reason being that we have largely the same guest list and there are several family members who are elderly and it's kind of a big deal for them to travel (it's a pretty good drive). Before I had a chance to ask, though, I got an invite for her kids party. On my daughter's birthday. 

The way schedules line up this year, it's basically the only weekend we can celebrate her birthday (plus, that day is her *actual* birthday). We're faced with a situation where we're heading to a party where everyone we would've invited to *her* birthday party is going to be there. She knows it's *her* birthday. People are unquestionably going to be giving her gifts that day because they won't see her before then. But it's not her birthday party. She's singing happy birthday to someone else even though it's her birthday. Also, if we go to this party, we basically can't do a party for her because it's a weekend trip.

So what I'm thinking of doing is asking if we can make it a three way birthday. Frankly, it's the only thing that makes sense in a practical way because the alternative is staying home and eating cake and ice cream and having her question why her grandparents and all her cousins aren't there. I feel like they would also be offended if we didn't go (plus, I want to celebrate my niece/nephew's birthdays!) But the other part of me says this is such a major social faux pas that I'll never live it down. ""Hey, can we make this my daughter's birthday party too?"" just seems incredibly rude. 

What should I do?

"I(16M) don't want to change my last name to my stepfather's(47m) last name


So, my step father has been in my life for as long as I remember, mom got divorced to my biological dad when I was like 6 months old, stepfather came in when I was around 1 to 1 and a half, dunno. But he's been with us ever since. In the few recent months, my mother and stepfather have brought up the topic of him adopting me, only once each, and only the other day when my mom brought it up did I say I didn't want that, and she said so it would carry on the Smith* name if I changed my name, since my (step) aunt's daughters are both married. But the thing is, there are other Smiths I just realized as I type, making that a bit redundant obviously.


I've said to her I'm okay with him adopting me, but just not the name change, but she said that was a big part of it. My stepdad and I have a nice relationship, he's a decent guy, bit hardheaded, but fine, though I still don't really call him dad, since even he doesn't respond to that most times, needing to say his actual name. Mind you, I haven't spoken to my own father for about five years.


I don't want my name changed because my name is who I am, I don't want F. Smith, or F. Brown-Smith, I just want F. Brown, nothing else. I want to give something to my name, not just let the alcoholics and junkies (my brother and father) to define it.

TLDR: I don't want to change my last name to my stepfather's last name. Side note, these are completely unreliable for some posts, if not all.

Hi Reddit Relationships! I want to start by saying I love my sister and my family but they've put me in a situation that straining out relationships. I'll provide some backstory. (names are changed)

My mother and father have been married for 39 years, they are amazing and supportive of all their children. I am the eldest at 35, my brother Ian is 32, my sister Ashley is 29. When I was 19 my grandmother passed away and left her house to my father who never planned to return because of a past trauma. I was given the house (legally it is my house in my name) with the agreement that I continue paying the mortgage and utility on my own, I've since finished paying it off and began remodeling. Around the time I was 24 my brother Ian moved in for a year to be closer to his job, during this time he payed rent and bought food and house supplies, it was a great year of bonding for us. He eventually moved in with his girlfriend (now wife).

So now I'm 35 living in this house and I get home one day to find Ashley unpacking in the extra room saying she was moving in. I got no notice of this, I talked to my parents about this and they said ""it's temporary while she's at college"". This flustered me because she has always been very anti-college and preaches that you don't need a degree to get a job, that it just puts you in more debt, blah blah blah. I tell them that I'm uncorfortable with this and they just brush it off saying ""Ian stayed I'd be rude not to help your sister"", the difference is that Ian is a sweetheart and Ashley is sour patch, but they agree to pay her rent and assure me it'll only be a year and I try to let it go. 

The issues started literally the next day because despite my house being closer to her school it's still to far for her and she doesn't have bus fare so she DEMANDED I take her to school. After her whining I gave in and did it only to find out its fashion school! My parent gave me the impression that she was doing something to turn her life around and finding a career, I have nothing again the fashion industry but it isn't a stable path for an unemployed nearly 30 year old woman. 

First month goes by and its bill time, I lay it out (I didn't including the remodeling fees because I didn't think was fair to charge her for it) and she flips her shit starts screaming and crying that how dare I ask for money then calls our parents and throws the phone at me and walks away. They explain that they can't afford to pay for both her college and her rent and that she's my sister and I should let it go. Not only is she living in my house, but she's eating my food (she can't by her own), and wasting my gas for this bullshit class. They now give me 200$ and month to cover gas. 

I know I must come off as a bad person trashing my sisters career path but I feel like she doesn't have a future in this and her grades reflect it. She is incredibly negative and rude to anyone who attempts to help her, this includes her former teacher who had her transferred to a different class after an incident that she won't tell me about. She's also incredibly racist and homophobic, there's many black gay men in her school who in her words are untalented and only there because ethnic and gay. I should mention that I am a lesbian and her language is beyond offensive, she won't hold back with, ni***rs this f*gs that, even when I have company over and my friend politely decline my invitations now. 

She regularly, almost daily has tantrums about how she's being discriminated against, and acts like she's more stressed than medical or law school students. She feels as though her clothing is better than the grades she's receiving, I'm not a fashion expert but I think the criticism she receives is more than fair. Her cloths are generic and look like anything you could pull of a rack at forever 21 which wouldn't be a bad thing if she didn't keep trying say it's high fashion and couture. She also thinks she is single handedly responsible for bringing back chokers, pink hair, braids, ect. 

Wow this has turned into a book, but wait there's more! Even though I don't agree with her career choice I've tried to help her with marketing by making accounts on Instagram, DePop, Etsy, and Facebook. She deleted every account once they got so much as a ""looks cheap"", then said that Gucci and Versace didn't get famous off social media. 

What do I do Reddit? What changes can be made? I don't mind her living with me but she shouldn't be able to buy her own food? Would it be rude to tell her I don't want her around when I have company? Am I just being overly judgmental?  

TL;DR: Parents moved my sister in for college, she doesn't pay for anything and eat my food, is going to a fashion college but is rude-racist-homophobic, doesn't accept help or criticism. I need to make house hold changes, how?

EDIT: I'll be making a contract this weekend with a deadline for her get her shit together. I'll also address my parents but separate. What should be added to the contract/converation? I'll be presenting it to her Sunday and I'll update how it goes. 

EDIT2: I posted this in the comments but it should also be added here. 

""I've since payed more in repairs to the house than what half of the original mortgage was. I was essentially kicked out at 19 and told I could live here and pay it or find somewhere else. 

Also my siblings got an actual inheritance, I did not, they also got 2 vintage well taken of cars amoung other things from her estate that add up to much more than half the house. 

My sister immediately spent all of this money on who knows what."""
"My mother [54F] isn't speaking to me [23F] after I realized I can't support us both and got accepted for an apartment for myself and my dog [6M].


**EDIT: I want to thank everyone who has posted so far and if anyone continues to post. I really appreciate all the kind words and congrats. It means a lot more than you guys can imagine.**

**EDIT #2: Just a few pointers. My parents had a great marriage to my sister and I's eyes. My father cut it off. My mother is TRYING to get a job, she has been for years but she just can't land one. Maybe its her fault idk. And my dog is in my post history since you guys are asking for a picture!**

I guess I'll try my best to keep this simple. 

My parents divorced in 2014 and unfortunately, my mom was unemployed in the process. 

My mom hasn't found a job since. She's slightly picky, semi-disabled (can't do labor jobs only admin work), and she's not young. 

She does have 30+ years experience in executive/administrative roles. 

EDIT: I offered to pay for her trip(s) &amp; buy her a car to move to Florida with her best friend who offered (we live in NYC) and she yelled at me and turned me down. 

So, when they divorced my mom and I got a place together. During the 2 years I was with her, even though I made good money, having to support both of us ended up racking up 20k in credit card debt and even while working 70 hours a week I couldn't handle all the bills plus trying not to ruin my credit. 

I was depressed, I was suicidal, I was trying so hard not to ruin myself, my relationship, my job, it was incredibly difficult. 

We ended up leaving the apartment (end of lease, good terms). 

Fast forward to 2016, we moved in to a bedroom in my grandmother's apartment rent free. Legally we shouldn't be here, and neither can my dog. 

NOTE: Grandmother is my father's mother so it's her mother in laws apartment. But my parents were together 40 years so my paternal grandmother views my mother as her own daughter. She actually doesn't speak much to my father/her son as he's a bit of a scumbag. I also have a little sister who's 19 and lives with my father. My mom loves my sister, we get along well. My sister and I are close. 

My mom only works a small temp job two days a week. 

I've been looking for a place and I told myself if my mother finds a full time job, she can come if she puts in her fair share of funds. I did take her to apartment showings for apartments that fit us and she always had a problem with something about it. It drove me insane. Especially if she wouldn't have a job, like I'm paying for rent. You can't tell me what to do with my damn apartment. 

So, I ended up getting an apartment for myself and my dog! Great location, close to my job, dog friendly, I'm so excited! My SO is also so proud of me. I move August 1. 

I'm also credit card debt free now. I've worked hard to get out of this. I've been going to weekly therapy, my SO and I are doing well, my dog is also very happy. 

I actually got accepted to the apartment last Sunday. My grandma was ecstatic, my SO almost cried, he's incredibly happy. I took my mom out with me to walk my dog and told her the news. She asked me the basic where/when questions followed by ""good for you.""

She hasn't spoken to me in a week and has been horribly passive aggressive. She will not acknowledge me unless I speak to her. She will be in such a good mood talking to my grandmother and sister but then to me, she gets monotone and uninterested. If I want to go out or something and I ask her to walk my dog before bed she says no. When she used to have no problem doing it before and loves him. What the flying fuck. I'm upset as hell now. What do I do?

TLDR; Got accepted for an apartment and moving in a month. Couldn't see myself supporting for my dependent mother any longer and risk my mental health and financial stability by racking up more credit card debt to support us both. I just got out of a 2 year bout of depression she caused by having me care for us both and finally paid off the 20k in credit cards I had while living with her and covering her expenses. She's being passive aggressive and won't speak to me now. Going on 7 days tomorrow. Don't know what do to. "

Hi r/relationships. I have a huge problem and I really need help. My first time posting here, English is not first language, and will take any advice given. Throwaway in case. Names have been changed and thank you for your time and help. 

Relationship background - 

I am 24/F and have been married to my husband ""Josh"" for 3 years now. We married early in our relationship because I had no where to stay or go. My immediate family cut me off when I was 18 when we all found out I was ill. I have a tumor that has not been responding to treatment. I have since developed even more health issues. Just typing this out makes me very sad. We have no kids but instead 2 amazing dogs, and I live together far, far away from my friends (over 3000 miles away). I lost my job 2 months ago but have a few thousands in savings to get me by while I am job hunting. Josh works full time. 

Relationship issues - 

Josh makes about 3x my salary. We split our bills accordingly, but I have always found myself covering for more food. I also do 90% of the chores. I buy food, cook the food, clean up. I clean the house, take care of our dogs, pay for our dogs... food, treats, toys, vet fees (they are not cheap). Those are the main things I do, and he is only in charge of vacuum (I am scared of vacuums, and if I weren't I'm sure I'd be in charge of that too) that he spends about an hour every other week doing. Even with our salary difference I have always thought of this arrangement as unfair. I have expressed wanting to cook together or clean together, or do anything together and he has refused. He comes home from work and spends time with his friends on the computer. Maybe twice a month he will come with me after begging to shopping or eating out. But he will complain and want to come home. 

Present situation - 

I am unhappy with so many things, especially myself. I am not the outgoing cheerful person who I used to be. I spend my free time lying around resting. I have so many doctor appointments, and that is the only time I leave the house (or if I am getting groceries). I have no friends or family. My health issues prevent me from doing a lot of things - I am tired so easily and cannot keep a consistent schedule. I have not eaten my preferred food in so many months. Josh does not like the food I eat, and I am far too lazy and tired to make separate meals, so I usually make him food and not eat anything for myself. Or I will end up eating cheap boxed food... I cannot even recognize myself in this body anymore. I cannot sleep or eat, anything I eat will not stay down, and I am constantly crying. 

I don't expect Josh to save me, but I cannot stay here any longer. I know I need to work on myself, but I do not have the time. Sometimes he will get mad at me and I am so scared. Once he threw a bottle at me, and my stomach was bruised for 2 weeks. Other times he has grabbed my wrists or ankles and dragged me across the room. If I make too much noise he will scream at me. I feel like a kid at times. I also believe he is interested in other people. Our sex life has taken a toll and I cannot remember the last time he has given me a hug or kiss. 

My questions now -  

Where do I go from here? I have tried therapy when my parents left me, which has helped greatly. But I moved away from my therapist, and the 3 different therapists here have not been as helpful. I do not have the funds to live by myself... my health costs are too expensive to even think about (around $11k-$15k a year) and I have no social support. I am trapped and unhappy. I don't like to put the blame on others, but I wish I had parents to fall back on. I wish I had some family who would reach out and help. I wish my husband would realize I am hurting and need his support so badly. I don't ask for much, I don't think I do. 

Is there any way to convince Josh that we need to work on our relationship? A divorce is one of the last things I would want, but I don't know if he will come around. Is there anything that I am doing wrong? Is there anything more I can do? 

What can I do for myself? I've purchased a few things to start going to the gym... I try so hard to get up every day and apply to at least 6 jobs before sundown. But I cannot help but feel like a robot at this point. Is this really what life is like after school? How can I be happy and enjoy what may be the last decades of my life with my health hanging over me? 

Please ask if I have left out any vital information. I will take ANY advice, I need help. Thank you so much again. 

TLDR: I am very sick and unhappy. I have no friends or family. I need to get my life together, but I can't seem to grasp the necessary steps. I need more options, and most importantly I want support. 

EDIT: Hi and thank you all for the responses. I have been reading them when I have a chance and have some questions. Sorry it will take a bit of time to respond. You guys are great.

Sorry this took so long to update, but because reasons the transplant process took a lot longer to happen than I thought. Long story short, because we had longer we were able to get our financial ducks in a row, save up more money to cover DH's time off work, and mobilize resources within our community and other family to help with childcare and other stuff and didn't need to ask for monetary help from the ILs. The transplant happened last month and was a complete success. DH is still not 100% recovered but doing well and getting back to work soon. 


Thanks everyone and don't forget to sign your donor cards!"

"I'm [24 F] quite a loner by choice, but I can't help feeling like a loser for it


I have always been introverted as far as I can remember. I was a quiet child and loved reading and playing on my own. However I was also bullied and had an emotionally abusive mother so I was really lonely and isolated anyway. What I'm saying is, I didn't really have the possibility do try out NOT being introverted.


Now, I grew up to be quite a loner. That doesn't mean I never leave the house or talk to anyone, but I do a lot of solitary stuff and I like it that way. I have only one friend and a few aquaintances, I spend most weekends alone, I go to concerts and to the cinema alone, I go on vacation alone, I sit in my flat and read, and that's all fine by me. I am also a notorious single and live alone. Very rarely I go out with people or even party, and that can be fun too but afterwards I'm like 'alright that was enough for the next few weeks' and need alone time again.


I am also pretty private and put a lot of value on peace and quiet. I guess I can be a bit annoying since I lose my patience very quickly with people who are 'overly social' and/or loud. I can get easily irritated by that and get a bit grumpy with people.


Anyway. I feel like this is who I am - I'm a private and solitary person, whether or not I was born like this or my past shaped me this way. And I've mostly adapted my life to that, the way I want it. But I still often feel like this makes me 'wrong' or that I am in fact an asocial loser or something. Mostly because that's what my mother thought about me - she would go on and on about me having no friends, sitting on the computer all day, she made fun of me for not having a boyfriend yet, and even now that I live on my own she often subtly suggests that my life is soooo lonely and boring, like asking what I did on my weekend and then judging it. When I was a child she often compared me to other children who were much more 'social' and I guess I'm just generally a disappointment to her.


Other people have also reacted similarly, like being flabberghasted when I mentioned I went somewhere alone. 'Why would you ever go to a concert by yourself?? Didn't you have someone to take with you?'' or ""Are you single? Oh why don't you go get a boyfriend? Well maybe that's good that you do things alone, won't have time for that once you're married and have kids haha!"" Ugh.. 


But then sometimes I think: true, I did not have anyone to take with me. I will probably never marry or have children. I might end up like a crazy cat lady somewhere in a small house by the sea or something. And while that does sound kinda appealing, it feels like I'm doing something wrong and should want to change it. Like I can understand that my lifestyle feels sad and pathetic to some other people, and that makes me feel kinda bad about it too. I want to get over it and not constantly second-guess myself and if my life is really what I want, because deep down I feel that it is!

UPDATE: This thread (scroll down a bit to see original) catalyzed me doing something a little bit drastic and impulsive but that I feel is the right thing.

A few posters suggested that once we get to our new location that I just refuse to leave thereafter, and if he doesn't get another postdoc then he will have to choose me or another postdoc in another location.

I like the spirit of that advice, but the trouble is that I don't actually want to live in this very high cost of living area (unless he is pretty much immediately seeks out a ""real"" job). 

So what I have done instead is bought a plane ticket to that city, which incidentally is just 2 hours from my late grandfather's house in the mountains. My family lives close by and they maintain my late grandfather's house because it is a special place for my family. I am going to live there for a few months and start to think about getting things together for a future life in a place of my choosing that may not involve him. 

I've told him that if he wants to stay with me he is going to have to start seriously preparing for industry interviews right away and lining up interviews ASAP. He can send off his academic applications (he has done this 4 times now so getting those together is not going to take him long) one last time in October, but once those applications are sent off he needs to not look back unless he gets an academic interview. 

Basically, until he starts to take serious action to create a life with me that we both want to live and communicates this with real, concrete actions, I am going to keep preparing for my new life without him. 

I have promised fidelity unless we actually decide to divorce. 

I am not sure where this is going to go, but I know in my heart that this is where I am and I am secure in this choice. He claims that he wants to be together and that he will start going on interviews ASAP. We'll see.

Thank you very, very much everyone for the kind and thoughtful replies. 

**** end of update 

This is a throwaway account.

Hi reddit, I am looking for some honest opinions about how I should proceed with my life. I am really scared. 

In 2013 I became engaged to my husband who was finishing up a 3 year postdoc in a quantitative field. He was extremely confident at that time that he would have a tenure track professor position the following fall, and I naively believed him...

Fast forward to 2017, and he still has only had a string of one-year postdoc contracts. We have moved to 4 places and 2 different countries in Europe since we become engaged and subsequently married. Fortunately I work as a freelancer in tech, so I have been able to follow him around. It has been VERY, VERY stressful on me because my home is my sanctuary (and workplace) and it is not easy to pick up and start over every year. Don't get me started on the loneliness. 
 
This past fall when it became clear that he would not get a permanent job that (4th) application round, I told him that I could not support another application round the following year and that I needed him to get a regular, industry job (any job!)  in a place where we could make a home. He (begrudgingly) agreed. 

One of the reasons for my hard line is that he has refused to start a family until he has a permanent job. Before we got married we were both in agreement that children were a top priority for us. 

In any event, now here we are in June and my husband has accepted a new one-year postdoc position in a new place, which means another international move. I actually supported his seeking out this position because it is in a major US city, and it would serve as a launchpad for him to pursue some kind of non-academic employment. 

However, now that this position is a reality and we've been discussing timelines, apartments, and other logistics, it has become clear that he is no where near the mental shift of leaving academia. His promises about going into industry are pretty much empty. He expects me to stay on this ride of uncertainty again. I feel betrayed and yanked around. 

I am really at a loss. I don't know what to do.

I love my husband, but I don't have any of the things I want out of life and no realistic path to get there. I empathize with many of the worried, sad feelings he must be having, but I am not willing to gamble my life anymore on a dream that is likely never to come true. 

His making empty promises to me and living in what I perceive to be a delusional mindset, I have lost a lot of confidence in him, and as I said above, I am very scared. 

Please help me out reddit. What should I do? 

  **tl;dr**: I told my husband I can't be a trailing spouse anymore last year. He has not worked to change the situation. "
"Me [29 M] with my Dad [60 M] went to visit and was disgusted by his comments about my Fiance and her daughter.


Recently went to my home country with my fiance and her daughter to visit my dad and have a vacation.  This was the second time my dad met my fiance (30/f) and first time meeting her daughter (13/f). The trip at the time I thought was great, it was two weeks we got to see a lot and do a lot.

On the final night he asked me to look at his phone when I noticed a text message conversation going on with his ex-girlfriend, one stating ""Now they need to fuck off"" and another stating ""You can't choose your children's partner"" this really hurt to see and I really had to process a lot. 

I decided to type out an email and planned to mail it once we had arrived at the airport that he was dropping us off. I sent the email and boarded my long flight with my phone off.

When we arrived at our destination there was a new email from him saying how terrible my fiance is and how her daughter has no respect for us and so forth this hurt me to see and I decided to cut off contact with him.  

I guess my question is am I justified, it really hurt seeing this. My mom loves my fiance, my step dad loves my fiancee, my uncle and aunt love her but my dad had to say these terrible things where I lost respect for him that he could even say it.

"Is the way my (23F) boyfriend of two years (32M) treats me normal?


My boyfriend  has communication issues. It's not  that he doesn't communicate much, but he doesn't communicate at all. 

Sometimes he'll come home angry or frustrated at something. I'll say hello and he'll just ignore me. I ask him if something is wrong. He ignores me. I'll ask him if I did something wrong? Usually more ignoring. But last night he just told me to go away.

He ignores me a lot. He denies it, but has a pretty funny definition of ignoring. To him ignoring is not hearing someone, so, since he heard me, it's not ignoring. It's just ""he has nothing to say"" or, my favorite, what I say ""doesn't merit a response."" This happens OFTEN. He expects me to listen about his work or hobbies, but he ignores or cuts me off when I talk about mine.

Yesterday I approached him a couple hours after one of these episodes, telling him the way he treats me isn't normal. I tell him that if he wants to be alone, say ""I want to be alone"" instead of ignoring me or saying ""go away."" He asks why. I tell him because it's not nice and it's disrespectful. He says he doesn't have to be respectful or nice.

Today he talked to me like normal. I told him I was still upset with him for saying he doesn't have to respect/be nice to me. He says that was my interpretation. It wasn't, it was verbatim. He concedes and says ""I wanted to be alone.""

He's really good at making me feel like I'm over reacting or being crazy. I feel like that one crazy girlfriend that's always freaking out over dishes or something.

TL;DR:
My boyfriend ignores me and tells me to go away. He's making me feel crazy for being upset about it."
