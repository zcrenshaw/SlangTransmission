"AirBnB has become a problem in my building. Anything the landlord can do about it?


Brooklyn, 5-unit building. One lease-holder has the first 3 units and runs all three as AirBnB spots. I and my upstairs neighbor are the only actual residents.

There are presently 12 AirBnB customers in the 2-bed garden apt. The building's front door is constantly left unlocked or propped open. I'm frequently chasing tourists off my fire escape. The revolving door of ""guests"" is a security concern.

Is there anything I or the landlord can do about this under NYC law?

Thanks!"

"What's your go to sandwich to order at a bodega/deli?


This city is peppered with delis and bodegas that sling the boar's heads meats and cheeses on different types of bread. Was curious what sort of custom sandwiches/wraps/panninis people order at their respective bodegas/delis. "
