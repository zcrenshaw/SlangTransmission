"My girlfriend brought back ""Jack and Jill"" from the video store. How can I go about leaving her?


She decided to get some groceries and a movie rental for tonight, and asked if I had something in mind - I said ""anything good"".. She is now in the living room with a copy of Adam Sandler's *Jack and Jill* ready to go for later. 

I just want to get out of this whole situation now. I don't even know her anymore. She's clearly capable of some reckless and dangerous decision-making and I want to be sure I do this safely. Please help me."
"Where do you stop shaving down below?


Hi,

I'm 17 and rather inexperienced in the whole thing of manscaping. I'd say that I am rather hairy down there and not entirely sure where leg hair stops and pubic hair begins. I drew a diagram of the effected region (https://imgur.com/a/cunPh).

Cheers

Edit: Well i'm going to bed because it's Midnight here in the UK. Cheers for the responses lads, I'm willing to do highly detailed biological diagrams for commission.

Edit 2: Basically the only time scorched earth tactics work is the German retreat from eastern europe. Keep it trimmed instead."

"A guy has told everyone that he has been having sex with my girlfriend. All I have is her word against his. What do I do?


For those of you who would like a back story, here it is. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 and half years. We were going to move in together and everything but she told me she wasn't ready, and she told me a few days after that, that she wasn't happy and didn't know what she wanted. I think she suffered some depression and anxiety due to some medications.

So we took a break. I know, a break is never a good thing. But I love her. I didn't want to end things, at all. So I told her to take some time to think about it and if you really don't want to be together anymore that's fine. 

So we took about a month break, we talked a little bit here and there, but she came back to me very apologetic, ready to start over. So of course I took her back, I love her.

But she told me that while we were on a break, and at her best friends house, her friends cousin was there and he ended up getting my girlfriends phone number from her friend. He starting texting her and talking to her. She admitted to texting him and said she was nice to him but that's it.

So eventually he developed feelings for her and wanted to hook up. She told him she didn't feel that way about him, and didn't want to take it further. He took it badly and began threatening her and took it further and sent a Snapchat around that said he had been fucking her for the past month.

So here we are. She swears it isn't true. And I believe her. What bothers me, however, is that this took place when we were on a break. The problem, is that there is no evidence ethier way.

TLDR; my girlfriend and I were on a break. She was texting a guy and he developed feelings for her. When she said she didn't feel the same way, he we t ahead and told everyone  they were having sex.

EDIT: let me make one more point, I believe her because of how much effort he has put forth in retaliating against her and trying to exploit her. I saw the Snapchat. It was very mean, it was your typical response if someone had just gotten rejected. 

EDIT 2: after a little research and asking around. I have found out that this guy has issues. He has abused girls before, and tweeted nasty things about them. I don't know if it makes things any clearer. "

"Best-friend died in accident 2 weeks ago, really struggling with the grief right now, any tips?


My best-friend was hit by someone who ran a red light 2 weeks ago.  Talking to people about it only does so much, but the grief and reality of it is really starting to hit me and I'm really not sure what else to do about it.  I've been staying pretty damn busy which helps as well as hanging out as much as possible with other close friends.  I've dealt with loss before (been to 5 family members funerals), but I've never felt sadness and loss at this level before and man it's really starting to fuck me up.  Not trying to receive sympathy, only looking for advice about how to deal with the grief on my own.  


EDIT:
Thank you everyone for all the responses and ideas, it helps to know there are strangers on the internet who can empathize with me.  I'll definitely look into grief counseling of some sort and just try to keep staying busy.  Once again thank you to everyone who commented trying to help, it really does mean a lot."
"What's a Reddit phenomena that you have never seen in real life?


Just finished reading a thread about all men get accused of kidnapping children if they so much as look at one wrong. Now, I'm a dude, and I love kids. I have a twin brother, so when young kids look at us together, they **stare**. I wave, say hello, and am generally friendly. I'm also a huge black dude in the deep south, and I babysit my 6 year-old niece all the time. I have never, ever had any parent object to my interacting with their kid or say anything when I'm playing with my  niece. I'm honestly confused when half the website basically relates to something that is completely foreign to me. So Reddit: what's something that seems to happen a lot to people on this website, but you personally haven't experienced?"
"What are some common fuck-ups I can avoid for my first job?


I start my first full time job next Monday and I am both nervous and excited. This is for an electronics design position for an automotive company right out of college. 

Edit: thanks for all the responses guys. I did not expect all the advice and I will try to read all of them. 

The most common things that I've read to do are ask questions, be reliable, don't gossip, and be humble. "

"How to deal with a copycat cousin


So I have this cousin who for as long as I can remember has tried to do a lot of the things I do. What I wear, what I say, the hobbies I have, how I get my hair cut, I also dyed my hair and he had it done the exact same colour. Hell, he ever changed sporting teams so he could support the same team as me. This probably seems trivial to you guys but it irritates me so fucking much. I would understand if he was a kid as they can be quite impressionable but we're the same age (20). Whenever I had these thoughts I believed I was being egotistical until other family members started to bring it up as well.  My mum tells me that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery but I don't feel flattered, only annoyed.  I brought it up with him and he just used deflection tactics, he's family and he doesn't have any friends so I can't stop talking to him either. "
"Street smart men, what would your advice be to someone growing up in a sheltered area?


My boyfriend is from the Belgian countryside and doesn't seem to have metabolized the idea that peaople are kinda dangerous. He doesn't know how to read the vibe of a bloc and will sometimes do things like: 

open his wallet in the middle of the street and show me how much money he has when I asked if he had cash on him

 or 

want to hold hands and be sweet when we have stumbled upon a clearly sketchy area and what we should be doing is getting the hell out of there.

among other things

I'm not even from a sketchy part of town, I was just raised in Mexico City in the 90's. it's kind of second nature to me to be mindful of my surroundings, so other than my standard reaction of what the hell are you doing, put your phone back in your pocket, close your face and look like youre going somewhere, I don't really know what to tell him. 

I'm wondering if there's someone who would be better at verbalizing advice than I am. We're going to be moving to Brussels and while I don't think it's necessarily more dangerous than DF, I'm honestly worried that this will end with him getting mugged in broad daylight"
