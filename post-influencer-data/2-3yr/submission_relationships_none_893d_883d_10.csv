Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ylr0k/dad_48_m_is_really_into_pokemon_go_and_i_18_f_am/

Hey Guys! It's been a while, but I remembered this post by chance yesterday and decided to follow up.

A lot of people in the original post said that he would likely lose interest within the next couple months. Well, here we are 7 months later, and he's still playing. The thing is, he got my mom to start playing with him! I pretty much never play now, but they have a great time playing together. My mother started in December, but she's already passed me in level and I think she has more Pokemon registered in her pokedex than my dad. I also haven't heard her complain about her foot pain in a while, so I don't think that should be an issue now. He has also stopped asking me so many questions and wanting that to be our only conversation topic, but that's probably also because he is now as experienced in the game as I am, if not more.

Over the weekend, we all went out for dinner, and were walking around the outside mall while waiting for our table to be ready. My mom whispered a little ""Omg!"" and showed us that there was a Tyranitar right across the street. For those who don't know, it's an extremely rare pokemon, and I think the most powerful one in the game right now, barring a legendary. We were all able to catch it :)
That's really all there is to say, and I think I was just worried that it would devolve into something addictive and unhealthy. But I see now that it's a fun little activity for the both of them, and I am glad we are all able to bond through it.

tl;dr: Dad still plays PoGo, got my Mom to play too. Now they're having fun together and working to catch 'em all."

Sorry it took so long to update you!

First of all, thanks for all the advice. Since it was the first time this happened to me in such a blunt way, I tried to handle it the best I could, but I was kind of lost about what to do. So thanks again, your advices really helped me.

Following your advices, I got home yesterday, asked my wife to sit down and told her what was going on. I showed her all the messages and explained to her in details what happened.

She was really concerned, didn't get mad or anything, she was just worried that - using her words -, ""that bitch would ruin your carreer and stress you out"".

So I told her I would talk to my boss and the HR next day, and so I did.

I arrived earlier, scheduled the meeting with HR and my boss (he went pale went I told him I'd like to talk with him and HR together - later he said he thought I would quit, haha!).

I sat down with them, asked them to be prepared for a mexican soap opera, and them showed them all the messages and explain to them all that happened.

I told them I'd like her to be moved to another desk, and that I trusted them to discipline her, so she would stop harassing me.

They listen very quietly, nodding between the sentences and doing quick question when in doubt.

After I finished telling my tale they said they would call her in to talk and address the subject, and that I could rest assured they would take all reasonable measures.

I went back to my desk, got to work (I was going on a business trip to Ciudad de Mexico following week, so I'm pretty busy), then I heard the BSCC phone (short for bat-shit-crazy-coworker) ring. She looked at me with suspicious on her eyes when she got up and went to talk to the HR, I tried to avoid eye contact and didn't express anything.

One hour later she comes back crying, get her purse and leave.

Everybody in the office was ""wtf just happened?"". My boss then call me into his office and told me what happened.

They told her I told them what was going on, then she made a whole dramatic shit show, telling she was in love with me and was fighting for what she thought was right, etc etc etc.

My boss and the HR person dismissed her silly arguments and told her she would need to keep things professional and move to another desk, otherwise they would have rescind the work contract.

And she prefered to get fired, so from now on she no longer works with me.

It has been 2 weeks and so far nothing related to the subject happened, so I guess my life is back the way I like it: just peace and quiet.

So, thanks again for all advices! I think my thoughts were kind of clouded by this shit, you guys made me think clearly, so thanks!

**tl;dr:** Told my wife, she was awesome. Told boss and HR, they were awesome. Crazy bitch was fired, which is awesome. I have my life back: peace and quiet.

---

**Edit:** I know this subreddt only allow one update, and I waited 15 days to post this, but this is important so I guess an Edit won't hurt anyone. Mods, please let me know if this is not cool.

Just got a call from her husband. Apparently she was crying all weekend and told him on monday why she was fired. 

He told he didn't buy her version of the facts, since the contradict herself in several points of her story.

He told he called the company to clarify what happened, and now was calling me just to make sure. 

I told him everything and offered to show him the messages. We are going to meet in an hour in a coffee next to the office.

He sounded hurt, but very clear minded.

Just told my boss, HR and my wife that I'm going to meet him, and my boss offered to go with me.

Man, I'm surrounded by good people.

**Edit2:** Just came back from the meeting with her husband. It was all very quickly.

I arrived with my boss, he was waiting for me. I just showed him the messages in my phone, answer some questions about what happened, and that was it. He said he just wanted to be sure, 'cause she deleted all of her messages.

He said this was not the first time something like that happened and apologized for everything. 

He said she was seeing a psychologist in the past, but she had stopped going recently.

I just said I didn't want nothing to do with it, that I came to meet him just to make clear I didn't want any of this to happen, wished him the best and left.

He just nodded and apologized again as I left.

I'm surprised with his reaction. Maybe he doesn't seem to be angry because they passed through something similar before, I don't know and really don't care. I'm just had enough drama and I'm glad this wasn't another one.

So, let's hope this is the end.

Thanks for your support and advice on this."

"Me (28F) with my twin sister (28F) just had her first child 7 months after I miscarried my first child. Struggling with jealousy towards her now


I (accidentally) got pregnant last year with my boyfriend of 6 years, and although it was definitely a surprise we were both pretty happy about it. I'm extremely close with my sister and told her and my mother straight away, and they were both extremely excited for me. When I was 12 weeks along my sister came to me and told me she was pregnant too with her husband, around 5 weeks at that time. Obviously this was extremely exciting, we've done everything together our whole lives and this was just beyond perfect timing! We started making birth plans, and what nursery designs we wanted, and it was generally just so lovely to be expecting at the same time.

Unfortunately, when I was 16 weeks, I started bleeding very heavily with a lot of pain, and ended up miscarrying. It was awful, an extremely traumatic time for me and I did struggle with the loss for quite a while. My boyfriend and my family were extremely supportive and loving, and I got into grief counselling within a month. It was tough, but I did honestly feel a good bit better until my niece was born.

My sister gave birth in March and it's absolutely destroyed me. I had struggled a little bit seeing my sister's belly during her last few months of pregnancy as we're identical and I couldn't help but think ""that should be what I look like"", however, it doesn't even come close to how I felt seeing her with my niece for the first time. I don't even know how to begin to explain how I feel. Just pure jealousy, even a bit of hatred towards her. I know it's not her fault that I miscarried but when I see how beautiful my niece is my rational thinking goes out the window and it just bubbles up inside me. I've managed to hold it in around her for the last few visits but I'm honestly frightened that I'm going to snap and scream at her. I've only held her daughter twice since she was born and I think she's starting to notice that I'm not comfortable around her since she's given birth.

Can anybody please give me advice on how to handle this? I really love my sister, and I know that she needs my support right now. My niece is a fussy baby, and she's struggling, and I really want to be there for her but I honestly just don't think I can handle it. I've booked a session with my therapist but I have to wait for my appointment. Has anyone ever dealt with these kinds of feelings before? How did you get past them? Please help me before I damage my relationship with my sister.

TL;DR: Had a miscarriage last year, now struggling to be around my twin sister and her newborn child with feelings of jealousy and loss. Need help moving past these feelings."

"Me (35m) with my wife (31f). After years of her seeming uninterested until she was ""in the mood"", my brain has finally got the memo and I don't feel sexually attracted to her. I'm freaking out.


I guess our sex life was centered around her libido, and if I were to initiate when she wasn't feeling""in the mood"" she would just turn away and mostly ignore me until I gave up. That seemed to me like she didn't want me, and after years of this, it feels like I started to put up guards against rejection. Over the last year I gradually stopped looking at her in a sexual way, and now it's constant.

I mean, our sex life is great, but in the days between having sex I can't approach her sexually or she'll act annoyed or something. Now she's initiating and I just don't feel anything.

I've talked to her about it but she doesn't know what to do or how to change. We live in a very rural area and have no one to talk to about it, and have no counseling available in the area and are stuck here for months.

I just don't know. When we have sex, everything is back to normal and we seem fine - playful and happy, until she kinda turns cold or disinterested, and then my sex drive turns off and I feel nothing when I look at her. It's lasting days and even weeks. I have no desire for sex with her. It feels like I'm protecting myself from rejection.

What do we do? Is this normal? I ache to be with her, but I can't feel anything sexual towards her when I look at her. She can get all handsy but I still won't feel anything. It's like I want to have sex, but can't bring myself to think of her like that because of all the rejection.

TL;DR : I don't feel anything sexual towards my wife even though she's really hot."

"Me [30F] with my husband [32 M] 3 years. I just found out I was the other woman in my husbands first marriage


When I met my now husband he told me he was in the middle of a divorce...which I found out this week was not completely the truth.  He wasn't in the middle of a divorce the divorce hadn't even started. But there was a break in their marriage because he had moved out 4 months prior to us ever meeting, so when I met him he was what appeared to be a man living alone, while trying to iron out all the complications of a divorce. They had a kid together so it also seemed logical that he was in contact with his ex during this time, and spending time at the house. Turns out she was still under the impression that their marriage was intact, that the move out was just him needing some space for the time being and he strung her along for those 4 months he was living on his own, as well as an additional 2, almost 3 months, into our relationship. They would make plans together (he would cancel last minute because he was with me) She would try desperately to be a good wife to him (probably hoping he'd come back) send him I love you text...to which he'd respond back with a ""love you too"" or the dreaded ""luv ya"" She'd offer to make him breakfast before work or dinner after work to get him to come by the house...sometimes he would go most of the time he wouldn't. He was pretty much using her while he tried to figure out what he wanted. And there were other things like we took a weekend trip about a month in, and had one of the best weekends ever, we still talk about it to this day...and he had sent her flowers during that trip. Probably because of his guilty cheating conscious. 

Well one day social media does what social media tends to do and it got him caught up. He never used Facebook but did have an account, which made him tag-able. We went on a trip with his friends and during that trip his friend tagged him in photos of us together, his mom commented on the photo pretty much calling him a POS for what he was doing to his family. I was like WHOA...what am I mixed up in? He had told me before his family had turned on him and did not approve of his divorce so he had pretty much cut them out of his life, so again I had a reason as to why his mom was so irate over seeing him with someone else. And again, divorce is messy so none of it seemed that suspicious. Well it turns out that was the incident that actually ended his marriage, because THAT is when his ex actually filed for divorce. 

Finding all of this out actually made things much more clear for me, I was always treated like I broke up their marriage but I always thought I had nothing to do with it, from my perspective they were done months before I ever met him and were just handling legal things. That was not that case. 

So here is my dilemma now, what do I do with this information? There is:
1) do nothing, it was so long ago, there is nothing to gain from it. We have such a great marriage and relationship, what's the point? I was really mad when I found out and now I don't know how I feel. I,too, have been in limbo in a relationship, where things are done but you're too scared to pull the trigger, so you just end up being a shitty person till the other party has had enough of you.

OR

2) Bring it up. He was technically cheating on me too. There are so many moments in the beginning that are now tainted or would have never been had I known the truth. I would never disrespect another woman or a marriage like that, and yet I did. And because of the position he put me in, I had to take years of being treated like scum by his family. And I also wonder, had he not got caught, how long would that have gone on?

We all live in the same town, but in different houses. My mom spends time with her too and the 3 of us have spent plenty of time together. But the other night she actually came knocking on my door, telling me that I spend way too much time with *her* granddaughter, that my niece preferred my company to hers because I spoiler her (I have no idea what this means), she had rights as a grandma, etc. I don't know what spurred this and she didn't respond when I asked. She said it was time we made a visitation chart, in which she got to see her more because she was the adult and it was HER granddaughter. I was stunned and apologized and she left.

"A guy[24M] I[20m] go to university with came to me with some information regarding my father[43M] and I am seriously confused as to what to do next


A few days ago I received a fb message from a guy that I've seen before on University since we both go to the same one. We hung out before but it was in a larger group and never just the two of us so I found this a bit strange but he told me that he'd like to talk with me about something, in private and not online. That was even weirder but I said okay, let's see what the fuss is about. 

And boy oh boy, did he had something to tell. Essentially and very shockingly, it turns out he might be my half-brother. We met and went to grab a coffee and he showed me an old picture of what he said was his dad whom he never met. His mom told him that his father left the country shortly before he was born and that's it. He only had this picture of him, his entire life. Up until a few weeks ago when he found my fb profile and saw pictures of my dad on it. 

And yep, it's the same guy. I can definitely confirm that the picture he showed me is my father but he was young, maybe like 17 or 18. I do know for a fact that between the ages of 18 and 20, my father and his family lived for a short while in a foreign country before coming back and going by this, I can see similarities in what Tom(fake name) said about his dad. 

Now, this whole thing took me by surprise and I am still quite shocked to know this. Honestly, never before I spotted any similarity between Tom and my dad but dear God now that I look at Tom, he is a carbon copy of my father. Facial structure, nose, eyes, everything. But this isn't why I am here. I am here because I don't even know how to bring this up with my dad, or should I ever bring it up. I mean, I should probably talk with him about this but I don't how to, especially after recent events. 

My dad has been depressed for awhile and it really was hard for our family during this time and only recently he started coming back to us. I fear that if this turns out to be true, it will throw him back in the same spot again. How can I best approach this situation?

tl;dr A guy I go to University with might be my half-brother. He showed me a photo of his dad that he carries with him all the time and I can confirm it is, in fact, my father. I don't know how to talk to my dad who has suffered from depression for awhile and only recently showed signs of improvement. "

I live overseas with my fiance. It's been a awhile since I've seen my mom who lives in another country. On top of that my mom has mentioned many many times how she wishes she could visit, wishes she could afford to travel, etc. 

For her birthday we thought a nice gift would be a round trip plane ticket. She could choose the date and we'd take care of the cost. We're lucky that we've been able to save up enough for this. We sent the offer in a birthday card. 

I waited, and then I waited some more, worried that it had gotten lost(totally plausible) I sent her a message. Didn't get anything back so I sent another one. She finally answered and thanked me for the card, no mention of what I had written inside. So I asked what she thought of the message inside. All I got back were the words ""I need to think about it"". It's been a week now, I can't get ahold of her. 

Have I done something wrong? I'm feeling kind of hurt right now and really quite confused. I also don't know how to broach the subject with her because she gets her feeling hurt easily. 

TLDR: bought mom a plane ticket, now shes not talking to me.

Edit: She's not destitute, she doesn't work so she doesn't have to take time off. She has a passport already. I forgot to say she would be staying with me if she wants to and that was in the card. "

"Me [30F] with my boyfriend of 5 years [29M] texting his married coworker [25F], I snooped in his phone and don't know where to go now. Please help.


Ok so here goes, this may be a long one. My boyfriend and I live in a fairly remote location, we have been together for 5 years (lived together for 4) and don't really have any friends, couple friends or otherwise. He has a few male friends in town he hangs out with and I'm mostly a loner but it's ok. For the story ME= me, BF= boyfriend (obvious sorry), and CW=cheating wife.

A little over a year ago, BF got a new coworker, a young mother, married to a guy he knew from high school. For the first 3 months they worked together, I knew nothing about her, then BF told me we were invited to her place for a party. It wasn't a party, just us and them and their kid. It sparked a small friendship between CW and I. But BF would always act weird whenever CW and I would hang out. 

Then came the day that CW told me how she nearly cheated on here husband and had an extensive emotional affair with a coworker at her previous job and how she was forced to leave said job by her husband because of the emotional/nearly physical affair. Now CW works with my BF. This story came straight from CW mouth and made me instantly have ill feelings towards her. 

We hung out as a group a few more times, most notable was the night we all hung out and got drunk. The second her husband went upstairs for bed, CW leaned her back against my BF's knee for the next 45 minutes until I insisted we leave. 

About 6 months after this incident, I had basically stopped hanging out and talking to CW at this point. We picked her up from the airport about 4 hours away from where we live. No way was BF going alone to get her, so I got stuck with a crappy roadtrip. CW had gone home for a month to visit her family, she did not reach out or text me once during her time away. But the entire roadtrip home from the airport every sentence out of her mouth was ""Oh BF, did you get this message or picture I sent you?"" My blood was boiling. And I demanded BF give up the friendship. He refuses. 

This has continued, he doesn't see her that I know of, but texts her on the regular and works together far to often for my tastes. Three days ago I broke, his phone went off constantly all night, so after he checked the messages in the morning, I took his phone while he showered. Input the password and read our demise. 

The messages are so unfair to me. They are clearly in a text relationship. Every other message is about how one misses the other. Cute pictures back and forth, constant updates on how the others day is. Funny things, silly things, a perfect text relationship. 

Something I had tried to have with BF since the beginning of our time together. I used to text him I missed him after not seeing him for a day, I'd get told that a day is not long enough to miss someone. I used to send him silly pictures, I got told I was just wasting his data, and I can show him when he sees me. Worse yet, I used to try to tell him my day and he just wouldn't respond. BF and I barely text, we really only use it to find out if the other needs something from the store. 

So after reading through his text relationship with CW, I am heartbroken. BF always told me he wasn't good at the cute things in relationships, hates texting and doesn't do it much. None of that seems true, just true about me. 

It all makes me feel like I'm not good enough, like he doesn't truly want to be with me, not if he is good at being exactly what I am craving but with CW. Not me. 

So do we break up? He threatens to break up with me every time I speak ill of CW. But he also still says he loves me. But also refuses to discuss future plans. 

I just need advice, has anyone ever been in this situation? Would you just pack up and leave? There are so many things I still love about him, so many ways we fit, but these stupid little things that have been missing since the beginning for me, are really really hurtful being seen happening with CW. She's freaking married, let her own husband miss her...I just want BF to miss me sometimes.

TL:DR- BF has had a text relationship with a married coworker for over a year, snooped and read the messages, he has the perfect relationship on paper with her, refuses to be the same way with me. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thank you ALL!! This blew up and I don't think I've ever seen so many redditors agree! Thank you for your clarity, for your kind words and for making me feel way less crazy. I spent the night bawling my eyes out, but things look brighter today, the sky is blue and I'm ready to send out my newly revised resume and see what the next adventure brings...
I will go through and try to respond to any further questions, but you all are right, I must get out. Last night he sent me a text message (from work, I wonder if she ended it?) that he's finally ready to move out of area with me. Good luck buddy, I'm leaving...you can stay. "

You can't sleep at night. And then there's the social stigma. You can't tell anyone because they'll think you're unclean, but in reality these bugs didn't even come from us. We bought some products to spray until the exterminator comes, but our landlord has been less than helpful. Someone is supposed to inspect the apartment Friday.
In the meantime, my room mate is losing her mind. She's in her room sobbing right now. She doesn't sleep. I told her to stay with her boyfriend but she's too ashamed to tell him what's happening. I don't know how to console her, what to say because I know this is her nightmare.

Tldr: room mate has a phobia of bed bugs and we are living her nightmare

"Should I (18m)talk to my little brother (14m) about sex?


So our father, sadly, passed away when we were young (me - 8, him 5). He was a good guy, a great dad, great husband, and we miss him every day. Sad, I know. But I'm not here for sympathy. This obviously led to us both missing out on some things a father and son usually do. I'm not saying I'm my little brother's father-figure or anything, but I do try to look out for him/advise him/help him, with things our dad might've done.


We're close. We get on well. We're different in alot of ways but we don't clash at all. We're something of a double-act really. We bounce off each other quite well. We're not like most brother-brother relationships I know of.


Being the older brother I, naturally, have went through things, done the trial and error (sweet lord Jesus in heaven the innumerable errors), and had time to reflect on them before he did. Shaving, taking care of his skin and his hygiene, social worries, future fears, etc... the basic teenage-boy shit, I've tried to help him with. I've tried to guide him, advise him, and help him, while holding in mind that he ain't me and some of his shit he has to work out himself. I accept that, at 18, I'm not really a fountain of knowledge - more of an empty cup really, but I try.


When it comes to sex I, like most of the internet, am obviously a handsome, muscular, experienced stud rocking a ten-incher. Or maybe I'm a fairly normal, fairly horny kid who maybe started too young. You'll never know. But seriously, it isn't something I'm a complete idiot about (listen to me brag). Protection, consent, communication, etc... I'd say I've a fair understanding of most of these things, and could probably rely it to him through embarrassment.


Now I obviously know my little brother has an intrest in sex. Yeah, disgusting for me to know, but he does. There's reasons I'd never use his laptop. Cracking dirty jokes, getting wandering eyes on hot girls, obviously try to be noticed by the ladies, etc.. Totally unlike me, who was/is subtle and smooth at all times/s.


Recently, he's started going out with his first real girlfriend. I know, adorable. I have been enjoying playing the part of the brutally teasing older brother through this experience (as well as a part-time chauffer, learn to ride a bike you little shits). But seriously I'm proud of my bro and the girl seems nice. It's funny watching him so sweet on the girl and vice versa.


Call me insane, but I think sex is a possibility. Fourteen, I'd say is a fairly normal age. They like one another. Yeah, it's my little brother and that just makes it so odd to me, but looking at it objectively - it might happen.


I'm not sure if I should talk to him about sex (things like consent, protection, expectations, etc... I'm not about to give him a play-by-play) or if I should just give him a condom and a wink. It's one of those things our dad might've done, our mom sure as hell ain't doing it (nothing against our angel of a mother, she just won't), and it's something that probably would've helped me if I'd had it.


I'm leaning towards having it, as you can probably tell. But advice would be appreciated. Or do you think it would honestly be better to leave it unless he come to me directly? 


TLDR - Dead dad, mom won't do it, I think I should talk to my younger brother about sex. Unsure if I should, leaning towards yes. Advice appreciated."
"My [24 M] girlfriend [22 F] doesn't seem to get what I view as inappropriate encounters


So my girlfriend has always been kindof oblivious to guys' intentions in an almost comical sense. In the past she has accidentally gone out with what other guys thought were dates all of the time - movies, dinners, etc. thinking she was just going with a friend.

We recently had a long discussion about this after a newer guy friend of hers asked her to a concert together. I tried to outline that, while I trust her and everything, he would probably have viewed that as a date.

This led to me having to explain the social norms of what is an ""inappropriate"" type of encounter while in a relationship. Things like going to movies with random guys, grabbing 1-on-1 drinks late at night, going to concerts alone, going over to watch netflix alone, etc. Just in general, things I assumed most people just don't go out of their way to do when in relationships.

I thought she understood, but the other day she comes home at 1am and I found out she had just been over watching movies at this guys apartment all night who I had never met. I don't even know where to start.

Am I just being jealous and should trust her judgement more? Is there a better way for me to communicate that this makes me uncomfortable?

"I [45F] am getting extremely sensitive by the age difference comments about my SO [38M]


Back story here:

4 years ago, my ex husband [48M] cheated on me with his PA [26F] and then wanted to reconcile claiming mid life crisis. It's the oldest, most boring story in the book.

I decided not to take him back as our kids had grown up and I didn't see a future in the marriage. When I told him I didn't want to work things out, over text, email, voicemail and in person, he called old, unattractive, washed up, used up, past my prime and tried me to make me feel like no one would ever want me again. One time he did this in public, at a family event, at my son's birthday party. My son, being a better man than his father, left the restaurant with me and didn't speak his father for over 2 months because of it.

I wasn't even going to tell my kids why we were divorcing but my ex told them himself in an effort to get their sympathy and then got surprised when it backfired. 

To him, he's some victim of a mistake and I didn't given him a second chance after nearly 20 years of marriage.

Rather than make me insecure, it made me furious and I was never more sure of my decision to divorce. He then turned all sweet and charming and said he was lashing out because he was afraid of loosing me. 

I didn't believe him then either. At that time, some of it was insecurity- if he can get a 20 something to have sex with him, why on earth would he want me? It didn't feel real. 

Then he moved in with his PA, got married the moment our divorced was finalized and then that marriage crashed and burned 1 year after it happened because she cheated on him. He tried coming back to me then as well, but it didn't work.

During that time, I was transitioning from a SAHM to getting back into the workforce but through connections, I found a job in a not for profit and am doing well now. I also suffered a huge blow to my self esteem because of my ex husband and there were times I felt so worthless.

I started going to the gym, looking after myself, finding hobbies, travelling etc and turning my loneliness into solitude instead. I was very determined not to be that bitter 40 year old woman who's life revolves around bad mouthing her ex. This seemed to make my ex husband more angry but I realized he was always trying to get a rise out of me so I would pay him any attention at all. My age in particular was the butt of make of his jibes which is maybe why I'm so sensitive to these comments.

About 1 year ago, I joined a hiking group on Meetup and I met my SO doing that on a doing a 22 day trek that was wildly out of my comfort zone but I felt great once I'd done it- I'm nearly 50 after all! And we really bonded over that.

I'm aware that there's an age difference but it's only 7 years as we are at the same stage of our lives- he's also divorced with kids (his wife cheated on him), he's got a very good career (as a director in a company), we share a lot of the same values, experiences and I feel like he respects me and is attracted to me despite my age.

It's not like I'm preying on someone half my age or who I have power over. 

My friends and family though, always make jokes about how I'm dating a younger man and tease me for being like my ex for chasing a man in his 30s and how I'm a cougar or cradle robber.

Now I get the cradle robber just is just funny because well, he's 38 so I can laugh at that but the comparisons to my ex hurt the most.

When I defend myself they just tell me I'm joking and then I feel like an idiot for being overly sensitive.

To me though, those comments are inappropriate but I always feel like a wet blanket if I point them out. The only people who haven't batted an eyelid are our kids funnily enough.

  **tl;dr**: How do I make these comments hurt less? Or handle it with better grace?"
"My dad (70M) is not speaking to me (24F) over a tattoo


My dad's visiting me from out of town.  We're pretty close, get along well.

I have two small tattoos, one on my ankle and one inside my elbow. My dad hates tattoos so I've been wearing a long sleeve and long jeans around my house even though I live in the desert and it's ~80 degrees. This morning I went to grab some laundry and had shorts on; he saw my small ankle tattoo. He couldn't even see what the tattoo was from that far away but was immediately livid and wouldn't even talk to me. He went outside to mess around with his car and I asked what he was up to today. He said he couldn't even talk to me and that he's so pissed off, that I'm trashy and that he has nothing to say to me. I pointed out that me having a tattoo affects his life in no way, and he responded that he's entitled to an opinion. True, but I don't see how what I put on my body is in any way personally offensive to his life.

I went to work this morning and just got home (7PM) and he isn't here, hasn't texted. Probably hanging out with his buddies in the next town but normally sends a text at least. I think his behavior is dramatic, I'm 24 years old and a graduate student, it's not like I'm covered in tacky tattoos and have no future. I have no idea how he'll act when he gets back to my house. I'm irritated that I have to feel stressed about this idiocy and roast in hot clothing in my own home. Also, I'd like to have a nice visit with my dad without him ruining it over something I see as 100% insignificant. I feel like he's entitled to disagree with me having a tat, but I don't think it's fair for him to act like I somehow wronged him.

Any advice?

EDIT: Dad just came back to the house and just went straight into his room. I'm getting kinda pissed, I didn't do anything wrong and I don't have to live my life according to his beliefs. I really hope he doesn't decide to ruin our whole visit with this crap. My mom is coming into town tomorrow so hopefully her presence will help the situation.

tl;dr - Dad acting dramatic that I have a tattoo, what can I do to move on from this situation?"

"My wife [32F] of 5 years wants to name our son after me [31M], but I hate the idea. She seems to be taking this personally even though I've told her she shouldn't.


It doesn't have anything to do with me not being happy or proud to be experiencing this with her. I'm very pleased that she soon will be the mother of my child, but no matter how I feel about her or the baby I am just not a fan of having a namesake. I think our son should have his own name, and I also think I should be entitled to keep mine. The whole thing seems hokey to me, especially when there are many great names we could pick for him, but I am flattered that she would want to honor me in this way. 

Obviously I have discussed this with my wife, and she has pushed back quite a bit, which surprised me at first. I'm not sure why this means so much to her, but for whatever the reason, this is something she seems to want badly. I'll give her credit. She has mentioned over the years that she thought it would be a cute thing to do, but I never really thought she was serious until she told me that she wanted to give our son my name. Saying something is cute is not the same thing as telling me she for sure wants to name her future son after me, but she insists that she told me in advance and I agreed, even though no such thing happened. That has become sort of a side argument and conflict here. She seems to think we already had agreed on this, but I don't think it's reasonable for her to claim we had an agreement when all I said was I thought it could be cool. That opinion has changed though.

I'm in a weird position here. I don't think my reasons for being against this are particularly persuasive, so I'm having a hard time making a good argument that this is a bad choice for our son's name. I think that (plus the hormones) is contributing to her feeling that my resistance here is somehow connected to me being ashamed of her or our baby. It seems crazy to put it into writing, but she has admitted she's struggling to understand why I'm fighting her so hard on this. 

So I think that really is the problem here. I need better reasons to try to persuade her against this, and I also need some ideas for how I convince her that this isn't anything that she should view as a negative against her. I'm not even sure how to address the fact that she thinks we previously agreed on this issue. 

Another thing I'd like feedback on is whether I should have the final say here since this is my name. I sort of am of the view that if one parent wants to name their child after the other parent then the parent who will share the name should get a full veto no questions asked. To me a name is a very personal thing and it's not right to try to force me into this situation. She also disagrees with me that my opposition immediately cancels this as a possible name choice.

"My GF [28f] has zero self worth. It's exhausting and Im [33m] leaving her. Help me do this right. 2 years together. 8 months living together.


This may go long but there's some juicy tidbits in there for ya. 

My girlfriend and I have been fighting a lot recently about sticking up for ourselves. She never does it. I have a stronger personality than her and she simply thinks its something I was born with. No. It's work to stick up for yourself. It's a conscious decision. I feel like she simply sits around and waits for life to happen to her. She doesnt take action. For instance, a big bomb in our relationship was when her and her sisters found out about a secret half brother. Her dad cheated on her mom and had a kid. Not good. But none of them will confront him on it. They simply wallow in unhappiness and fake it when he comes around. To me, in my family, that's absolute craziness. Everyone is on deck to be called out for shitty behavior. And people make mistakes. Its ok. The mom forgave him. But the girls just let it fester and the wound just gets worse. 

Consequently, our relationship pays the price for dad's infidelity AND her ex's manipulative behavior. Shes suspicious of everything I do. She gave me a dirty look for touching her sisters shoulder when she had these spiky gold, well, spikes on her shirt. I introduced her to old friends and she asked all these questions about the girls, but none of the guys. A guy is excited to see me for the first time in years...just my buddy. A girl is excited to see me for the first time in years...I'm obviously cheating on her with all of them lol. I asked her about it and she claims she doesn't remember any of the jealousy parts. Before, she even held it against me that I had another quick date before our first date. I never even knew her yet! But she uses that as evidence that I'm not to be trusted and I'm going to abandon her. 

She just doesn't understand that she is worth sticking up for. Her life goals are worth making a fuss over. If she wants something she should work with people to get it, not just take what people give her. If you let people walk all over you then you're at their mercy. That's how she feels. Powerless. At everyone's mercy. I feel like this is a basic difference in how we view life and how we achieve our goals. I'm not even sure she has goals because she doesn't think she could ever achieve them. 


Conversation:

GF: I'm worthless *crying*

Me: What do you do that makes you feel worthwhile?

GF: I do things for you. I do things for my bosses. 

Me: No what do *you* do for *you* that makes you feel good?

GF: I told you. I do things for you. I do things for other people.

Me: You're not understanding the question. Name a thing you do that you like to do.""

GF: Hang out. Make you happy. 

Ugh. That's an oppressive responsibility to me. Her self worth is based on my happiness? I dont want that. Nobody but a psychopath wants that. I don't want to be the sole shareholder of her entire sense of self.

I just dont think she understands the concept of self love and building a sense of self.  It's like she's simply a victim of whatever everyone else thinks of her. In her world, there is no discussion. Whatever other people think or say about her, they're right. It's almost like whoever speaks first gets what they want. I know Asian culture and Southern Baptist culture is very obedient to your elders, but I'm not an elder. I'm her equal. She's an adult now. Her parents are equals. Her cheating dad. Equal. But how can I be her equal when she thinks she's nothing? 

She won't get therapy. I've tried that game. Speaking about her feelings is overwhelmingly frightening for her. Please help. What can I say?

As for me, I truly don't feel close to my girlfriend. I connect with people through conversation, same interests, building something creative together. For her, its simply occupying nearby space. No emotional or mental connection is necessary, in fact, that's actually a lot of effort for her. It's exhausting just to try to have a conversation. It's like a game of catch where I throw the ball, then she throws it halfway back, so I have to walk over, pick up the ball and throw it back. Then she throws it back again halfway. So I walk over, pick up the ball...you get it. Eventually you learn to stop throwing the ball. That's where we're at. It's miserable because she's miserable. How do I get her to go to therapy? How do I get her to put away her mean ex bf and her cheating father? Our relationship pays the price for other people's mistakes. I'm not mean to her. I never cheated on her. But I'm not trusted anyway. Thats not right to me. 

I'm leaving her. Help me let her down easy. I'm expecting a nightmare of tears and low self esteem. But I feel like my strong personality is a shield she hides behind. She doesn't have to develop her own means of self protection and self worth because she can use mine. I worry if I break up with her she's just going to do the same thing with another bf. I want her to be strong and confident and willing to accept love. But its just not happening. I can stick it out until the end of our lease together if it means she'd be ok and not in a dark place afterwards. Please help me help her.

"My (26f) bf (27m) broke up with a long-term girlfriend (27f) over her drinking. She's now clean and wants him back. Feeling terrified.


I met my bf about a year and a half ago through friends. He's funny, handsome smart, you know the speil. Basically we've been together since and it's been bliss.


I knew he had recently gotten out of a ltr (I think 6 years from 19 to 25 counts as long term? :s) with a girl when we met. ""Alice"" (not her real name, oc). Alice and he had been friends from a young age, eventually going out when they were nineteen. According to him it was good, but in the last year, she started drinking all the time. And not a ""nearly every night"" kind of all the time. At least two times a day everyday until she passed out before he finally left her.


He and she both come from families where alcoholism is an issue (he says this is likely why she fell into it). He says he wasn't about to live like that, or be with an alcoholic and drew the line. The break-up, according to him, was a tough one that involved completely cutting away from her.


He has said that he is totally over her and in love with me and I believed him. He never mentioned her unless prompted/neccesary. There was no contact with her. I'd never even met her. As far as I was concerned, she was his ex and that alone. He wasn't hung up on her. I wasn't a fallback option.


But recently a series of posts on facebook made the rounds amongst his friends - basically a book apologising to him, telling how she got clean, how him leaving woke her up, etc... If I'd been reading it as anything other than his gf, I'd have been cheering her on all the way. But obviously I wasn't.


This has honestly terrified me to my core. I know it's so early and it's so cringey to say but I imagine my bf in my head as ""the one"" now. The one I want to be with for the rest of my life. And this has me feeling like I'm just something in the way of his true love. I feel like the antagonist in their love story.


I told my bf this, and he says he's spoken to her and made clear that we're in a relationship and while he's very happy she's clean and he'd like to become friends again, it's me and him now. He says Alice took it hard but accepted it.


I hate this girl for making me feel this way, and I hate myself for hating her when she's done nothing wrong to me. I'm always worrying that my bf is going to leave for her, or I'm going to find something between then on his phone/social media. They knew each other so long, and they went out for so long, and went through so much together. I just can't not be paranoid about this girl.


Hating everything rn... Not even sure wether to post this here or on /r/offmychest. Is there anything I can do to get over this?


Tl;dr - Bf broke off a LTR with a girl because she was an alcoholic. She got clean largely due to him leaving and now wants him back. Worried he loves her more than me and will leave."

This guy Colter from my swimming class asked me out about two weeks ago, he seemed ok and I was bored so I said yes. First date wasn't bad because it was a movie, second was awful as he's just one of those people who talks about himself constantly and just doesn't seem to get the hint that the other person is either bored or not interested at all. He tried to kiss me at the end of the date. I sort of ducked out of the way and said I was flattered but that I really wasn't interested in s relationship. He made a snide remark about why did I let him pay for dinner then and I reminded him that I paid for the movie and snacks so if anything we were even. He tried to play it off like a joke and said fair enough and we said goodbye.

Since the beginning of this week he is EVERYWHERE I AM. He sees me between classes and wants to walk with me, he just ""happened to be"" in my assigned parking lot (his is a shuttle lot, literally across town) and about two minutes ago even though he doesn't live on campus he just happened to be In the union dining hall because ""he does that sometimes"" (this is my second year living on campus and I've never seen him in here). He always wants to just chat and catch up...but we literally have nothing to catch up about because NO KIDDING I've run into him 30 times since Monday morning. 

He's harmless and I'm not afraid of him but he's annoying the crap out of me. I'm not a mean person and I kind of feel bad in telling him to leave me alone and I guess technically he's allowed to be on campus wherever he wants...so how do I end this?
