"""But you're here, that means you're open.""


I work in an electronics repair shop that does all kinds of work, mainly cell phones, and accessory sales for most of the stuff we fix. People just die when they don't have their phones, so customers are either thrilled with the short (usually less than an hour) turn around time, or upset that it takes ""so long.""  Employees get there 20 minutes before the store opens to take care of opening duties, normal for any kind of job. That means that sometimes we have people waiting at the front and only door when we get there.

I noticed someone riding my ass on the way into work one day, a silver SUV. When I got over to turn into the back parking lot, surprise surprise, the SUV turned into the store front lot... And was parked outside of the front door. I don't acknowledge anyone outside like this before open unless they come to me, and if they're just asking if we're open I'll have them wait inside and usually take care of the customer a bit early.  Well this lady, L for short, followed me in as I was disarming the security alarm, and tried to put 2 iPads in my hand. This is how it went.

Me: I'm sorry, but we're not open for another 20 minutes, you'll have to wait until then.

L: But I just need to drop these off, I work at 10.

Me: If you'd like to wait inside, that's fine, and as soon as I'm done with opening duties I can check you in. (I haven't even turned the lights on yet)

L: but I'm here now, I can't wait that long.

Me: ma'am it's going to take me about 20 minutes anyway to test your devices and create tickets, and I need to open the store first. 

L: But you're here, that means you're open

Me: ma'am the store doesn't open until 10. (I gesture to the open sign)

L: Oh it's close enough, just hurry up, I don't have time for this. (She's getting annoyed)

Me: okay, give me about 10 minutes, I'll go as fast as I can to open up for you. (Because iPad screens are pure profit. Just a lot of glued glass shard peeling that takes a while for labor)

L: what? No, do it now. I need to drop these off. 

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but no. If you would like to wait, you can, and it'll be about 10 minutes. Otherwise you will need to come back when the store is open.

L: But you're HERE NOW. YOU ARE OPEN.

Me: (okay. Snarky bitch. Fine.) Ma'am, the store is not open until 10 o'clock. I've offered you a space to wait and said I'd ring you in early. You refused. I can't help you further at this point, please leave.

L: NO. You can't throw me out. You're open.

Me: No, we're not. Please leave.

L: Fine, whatever. (Huff)

Big surprise, she came back later....... Wait for it.... 30 minutes til close with the same 2 iPads. My coworker helped her this time. He took her devices in, offered her a discount for bringing in multiple repairs, and then I hear THIS from up front.

Coworker: alright, the total on pickup is $182.43, they'll be ready for you by early afternoon tomorrow.

L: oh no, I can't come back, I was going to wait for them.

CW: uh... Ma'am these will probably take a couple hours each, we're only open until 7.

L: It's 6:30.

CW: We leave the shop at 7 ma'am.

L: Oh, no, I got here before close. I'll wait, it's okay. (Tone of complete ignorance)

At this point I tell the Man(ager) that it's the lady from this morning, and the Man goes up front.

The Man: ma'am I overheard a bit of the conversation, it's going to take about 4 hours for your repairs, and I'm not making my techs stay until almost midnight. We're leaving at 7 and you will need to leave then, too.

L: (she knew. Immediately entering a customer rage) Your SHOP is a WASTE of my TIME. I'm NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!! (Left without her iPads.)

She didn't come back to pick them up for two weeks. She paid in full, didn't make a peep on payment. I feel sorry for her family."
"""Discount?"" ""No."" ""Please?"" ""No."" ""Do you treat your mother this way?"" ""Yes.""


LTL:FTP

Working in retail, you will always get people asking for a discount. This is normal. Most will grumble a bit, but accept it. This couple, however, refused to believe I would not give them a discount.

Some background: I work in a department store in cosmetics. My department is the only one that without fail will never have a discount. This is due to the fact that we are technically venders. My store doesn't pay me, my vendor does. So, despite the fact that my store literally prints coupons for the customer at every opportunity, I know without looking at a customer coupon that no, it won't work here.

Now, I am just going to post this as a conversation. I don't think you would get the full effect otherwise. 

Me = me
TH - the husband 
TW - the wife

TH - "" I am a card holder, do I get a discount?""

Me- ""sorry sir we don't offer discounts here.""

TH - "" I shop here, why don't I?"" 

Me - ""sorry, we don't have a discount."" 

TW - ""you can give us a discount.""

Me - ""no, sorry.""

TW - ""we have a coupon, we can get a discount.""

Me - ""coupons don't work here, sorry.""

TW - ""you can give us 20%?""

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""10%?""

Me - ""No."" 

TW - ""5%?""

Me - "" No.""

TW - ""its for my daughter?""

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""You are very pretty."" 

Me - ""Thanks.""

TW - "" discount?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""If your mother came in, and was going to buy this perfume for you, would you give her a discount?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""why? She is your mother!"" 

Me - ""No discount.""

TW- ""Can I get that bag?"" (Some brands send bags to give away with their products. The perfume she wanted did not have a bag. You also cannot get a bag with a gift set.)

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""Why not?""

Me - ""You are buying a gift set. Bags only come with single bottles.""

TW - ""so if I get the bottle I get the bag?"" 

Me - ""No.""

TW - ""Why not?""

Me - ""That bag is not for this brand.""

TW - ""Can't you give me it?""

 Me - ""No.""

TW - ""please. It's for my daughter. ""

Me - ""No.""

They finally conceded and followed me to the cash register.


And promptly saw that we offer a discount, that applies to cosmetics, if you open a credit card. so despite the fact they already had a card, under the husbands name, they opened a second under the wife's name.

To save how much? 22 dollars

The thing is though, I could've given them a bag, i wouldn't lose my job over it like giving them a discount, but at that point I had transcended to the point on emotionless retail robot that I wanted them to have nothing. 

TL:DR : ""No.""

"Sales Bring Out The Worst In People


This happened the other day I just didn't have time to post. Sorry about the length!

So my store had a sale on hand soap. Buy one get one and you get a couple thousand points. Not a bad deal and the points can be saved up for later. Well good sales usually bring the worst types of customers into the store. The coupon crazed, middle aged women who firmly believe that their expired $0.60 off coupon is worth more than the jobs of whatever poor retail slave gets stuck ringing them up. 

Now our website does this cool thing where it tells you what store is closest to you and how much it has of whatever product you're looking for. It updates it's numbers every night after the computer runs its closing programs. Unfortunately we sold all eight cases of that particular soap within the first hour we were open. Apparently our sale coincided with a coupon for $1 off of 2. Since our website hadn't updated yet we had couponers coming in all day demanding hand soap or they would call corporate. 

So we're ten minutes from close, praying that nobody else comes in looking for that dang soap when a woman walked in. You know the type: yoga pants, motivational saying emblazoned across their chest in rhinestones, one of those binders filled with coupons and the ""let me speak to your manager"" haircut. 

She zoomed back to the soap aisle where she was met with an empty shelf and the signs we put up stating that we were out of stock. She came back up the the register, where I had already sent my cashier to start her closing duties, and demanded a manger. I informed her that I was the closing manager and that I would help her if I could. 

She shall be CL (Coupon Lady-for obvious reasons)

CL: Excuse me but your website says you have 96 of this Brand Soap. Your shelf is empty, so I need you to grab the rest from the back for me. I want all 96 of them. 

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but we've been out of them since this morning. If you had come in earlier-

CL (interrupted): Earlier? How could I come in early? I had to clip 96 coupons for this soap because YOUR WEBSITE SAID YOU HAD IT!

Me: Please don't raise your voice at me. We get a new shipment later in the week. The sale will still be running then, if you want to come back--

CL: NO. (Bangs coupon binder on counter for emphasis) you will go get me my soap. I know you have some you're just keeping it for YOURSELF! 

Me: I asked you not to raise your voice at me. Ma'am it's now past closing time, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. If you want you can call the store tomorrow to talk to the Store Manager he might be better able to help you. 

CL: You best be getting him on the phone RIGHT NOW. You ain't a real manager and I AIN'T LEAVING UNTIL I GET SOME HELP. I CUT COUPONS ALL DAY AND YOHR WEBSITE SAID YOU HAD 96! I'm not leaving until I have 96 soaps! 

At this point she was slamming her binder into the counter with each word she spoke. Because that is how reasonable people communicate I guess. 

Me: If you won't leave I'm going to have to call the police. I'll ask you once more to leave and call back at a time when we can resolve this to your satisfaction. 

CL:  F*** YOU B**** I'LL SIT MY A** DOWN RIGHT HERE AND I AIN'T GOIN NOWHERE. 

She then yanked open her binder and started throwing the previously mentioned soap coupons onto the counter. I called the police and she was still in the middle of her adult tantrum when an officer came in. 

As we went through the standard ""what seems to be the problem"" more police cars show up. His little radio thing on his hip starts squawking. After he answered it his whole demeanor changed. He asked her to come with him outside to answer some questions about the car she was driving. 

She turned and bolted but didn't get far before he caught her. My cashier and I watched as he led her to the police car outside. Five other police cars were parked in a semi circle around the truck she had driven. Several other officers were asking her male companion to step out of the vehicle. 

My cashier and I watched from the window (officers told us not to come outside) as they tried for 20 minutes to get the guy to leave the truck. They had guns pointed and everything. 

I heard from the store manager later that the car she was driving was stolen and the guy she was with was her dealer and he had drugs on him. Apparently she was going to pay him in soap? I don't know how that works. It was a roller coaster of a night. 

TL;DR woman freaks out about coupons until I called the police who arrested her and her dealer for driving a stolen truck.

"This was on the clearance rack for 9.99


I hear this excuse all the time. 

A customer brings up a shirt with no price tag on it. They tell me they found it on the clearance rack.  I tell them ""without a barcode to scan I can't give you a clearance price"" 

It hardly bugs me. People are cheap oh well they'd rather pay 8.99 than a whopping 9.99 for a shirt.  

Well today it actually made me mad.  

&amp;nbsp;

We sell designer brands (North Face, Calvin Klein etc) for discounted prices but still pretty expensive. Normal shirts are 9.99. Designer shirts go for $30 and up. 

Today this lady brings up a designer shirt to me without a price tag. She sees me looking up the designer price on my register and she practically yells ""OH THAT WAS ON THE CLEARANCE RACK FOR 9.99""

Already Knowing she's full of it, I say ""can you go grab another one then because without a price tag I can't give you a clearance price""

""That was the only one back there""

Normally I keep my cool and bury my emotions at work.  But this lady triggered me so bad with her stupid lying. I gave her attitude. ""If it's the only one back there and there's no price tag on it then how do you know it costs 9.99??? This shirt is 30 dollars."" 

She called the manager over and told him I was being rude.  Luckily he likes me, and he saw it all for himself. He says to her ""well he's right how do you know it's 9.99 if there's no price tag on it and no more on the clearance rack?"" 

She threw her bags on the counter and stormed out.  

I'm so sick of people who lie.  Do I really appear to be so stupid that I'd think a Calvin Klein shirt costs 9.99 when I've been selling them for two years priced at 30 dollars? Even when they get marked down the lowest they ever go to is to 20.99. 

*Forgot to mention that we don't hang up signs or anything that says ""all items on this rack $10 and under!"" There's literally nothing there that would say the shirt is 9.99 unless she just grabbed a shirt next to it and looked at that price and assumed that was the price. "
