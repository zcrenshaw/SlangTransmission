"I [29 M] am not able to forgive my parents [47F/55M]


I am a 29 year old male who was living in a 1st world country for over 5 years. I come from an Asian country where the culture revolves entirely around family. I had a really good job in 1 of the best cities of the world. But my parents always kept on emotionally blackmailing me to take up a lesser job in my home country because they couldn't imagine a life alone. My dad retired early like at 45, (mostly because his business was not good) and never took care of the family and I have been meeting the financial needs of the family for the last 8 years.

After years of resisting the emotional blackmail, I finally accepted a job in my home country and shifted back, though to a different city from my original city. My parents moved in with me in the new city within a week of my shifting back.

Culturally I am now supposed to take care of them, show them around, create a life for them and make them feel awesome. But the sacrifice has taken a toll on me. I didn't know anyone in the city before moving back and somehow the desire to socialize has died. I just go back home and don't even interact with my parents let alone showing them around.

There is a huge anger inside me that a 47/55 year old couple who can't create a social life of their own (not financially as I have been paying their bills and much more since a long time) wants to live a parasitic social life off their sons social life and that anger is preventing me from creating a social life of which they will be a part of.

How do I forgive them and accept the new reality?



  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Parents emotionally blackmailed me to move back to home country to live a parasitic social life off my social life. Anger preventing me from creating a social life for myself. Need advice to be able to forgive them and accept new reality.


Edit: Thanks everyone for the inputs and really appreciate all the support. I did think over it and its a huge decision. I do agree that my parents were selfish but its not 'entirely' there fault. The Indian culture is to blame as well. I am planning to sweat out the next few months and prepare to move back to my old job while continuing to financially support my parents from abroad."
"I (29/f) am concerned about PPD and ""doing it all"" when my husband (28/m) just lost his dad (UPDATE after 6 months)


It’s been a while, and I wanted to provide an [update from my post six months](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/59iugz/i_28f_am_concerned_about_ppd_and_doing_it_all/) ago detailing my PPD and loss of FIL. You guys had been extremely helpful, and I know I PERSONALLY like seeing happy updates. So here is mine.

However, before I get on to the update, I wanted to clarify one thing: My husband didn’t actually know ahead of time his father was sick or going to die. I don’t want to get into too many details, but he was okay, then things went downhill instantly, and then a few days later he was actually gone.

Now off to the update! First off, I took a lot of advice to heart. I’m going to do a list so I don’t talk your ear off!:

* I insisted on talking this out with my husband. I explained my concerns, grievances, and needs, and he picked up his portion right away. He has not slacked off since. He took me on a really fancy date shortly after. We have regular dates where I feel like his *wife* again.

* MIL came home, and we now had two possible babysitters.

* I brought up my issues with my therapist, and we’d utilized CBT for other issues I had, so this was a no brainer. We meet weekly. I also brought up the martyr like way I handled everything, as someone pointed out. Because they were right.

* Pysch upped my regular dose of antidepressant and added something temporary for anxiety. We meet monthly.

* I paid for temporary maid service.

* I went back in to work. That has helped a LOT. Sometimes my husband and I meet for lunch for babysitter-unnecessary dates, and other times I meet my own friends for lunch. I am excelling at work, which makes me work harder. I feel in my element. She is in daycare, and she also loves that. She has a favorite teacher already.

* I insisted sex be more “mutual.” He was on board. When that happened, other self-care routines returned. I get my hair done, wear nicer clothes, and make sure my makeup is done.

* I dropped the hurtful friends. Not in hateful or dramatic ways, but slow fades, blaming the (admittedly true) lack of time in my life.

As a result, my husband and I feel stronger than we had in a while. I feel like an individual, a wife, AND a mom. I’m also bonding better now with her. I’m delighting in seeing new skills just click for her, and her smiles/chatting/laughs bring me joy.

Thank you, Reddit.

  **tl;dr**: I love my husband dearly but find myself competing with the memory of a manic pixie dream girl of his. What can I do to change the situation or change my mindset?

---

I met my husband three years ago on match.com. I'm a quiet and caring person that naturally blends into the crowd and have never been noticed much by boys all my life. Did the whole online dating thing for almost a year before finally meeting John, whom I married two years later. To me, John is the most wonderful and special person I've ever had the pleasure to meet. We love each other dearly and tell each other so every day. 

When our relationship became serious after a few months of dating, John read me a story he wrote about a previous love of his (Taylor), because it is an important part of him that he wanted to share with me. They met about 5 years ago during a once in a lifetime volunteering experience and spent the most amazing summer together in a beautiful place.

The story is about the special moments they shared together, things Taylor did for him on his birthday, group adventures they attended together where John only had eyes for Taylor, the nights they stayed up all night by the bonfire talking about life, and a lot more. This happened five years ago although the story was wrote shortly before John and I met online. I should mention that Taylor and John had an amicable breakup and kept in touch, but John stopped replying to Taylor after we got married.

The thing is, John and I never had many such special moments together. We used to and still do go on date in nice restaurants, frequent the west end, occasionally escape into the countryside over the weekends, but it was never something wild and magical. On our birthdays we buy each other nice gifts and spend quality time with the parents, but we don't disappear into the woods for a whole day and shout each other's names from top of a mountain.

I don't have a single thing to complain about our life together and John tells me everyday how happy he is with me. And this is what confuses me so much: I find myself comparing the way John treats me, to the way he used to treat his old love. Just a few examples: John can never remember what I got him on his birthdays and other holidays but can write down in great detail about the one birthday he got to spend with Taylor (she did ten cute things for him/with him). He wrote about the Taylor's look on the day he last saw her in great detail but can't remember what I wore the morning after our wedding. I occasionally get too excited to sleep, he says to need to get up early the next morning and just kisses me goodnight and goes to sleep himself, which only reminds me of him working 12 hour days while doing all he can to stay awake so that he could talk to Taylor all night. I know this all sounds immature and petty but I just can't help but feel...a little less special. I've never been the most special person in a group but I had hoped I'd be the most special woman for my husband.

I have talked to John about this, but he says it was all in the past and he is too content with his life with me to even think about Taylor now, although I find it hard to believe, given the 10k+ words story he read me about Taylor. I want to be the woman he writes about and tells his kids about when he gets old, but I have a feeling this is not going to happen. I also feel a bit guilty when these incidences come up, because I fear that they are the proof that Taylor is John's true love but he is subconsciously suppressing his feelings. I don't want to get go of him because he is the most special person for me, but I may not be special enough for him.

"Me [30F] with my best friend [31F] of 10 years told me I can't bring my SO to theme park.


This seems petty, but I’m not really sure how to respond. I’ll try to keep it short but give context. 


Backstory: I’ve been friends with Liz for nearly 10 years. She was my closest friend since we met in college and when we graduated, we lived 2 hours apart from one another. About 4 years ago, she moved to another state with her SO, Chuck [34M]. She visited her family a few times a year since she moved, and I would drive the 2 hours to see her. Even when she was away, we’d talk or text daily. 


Since she’s moved away, as her life has progressed, so has mine. I’m very happy for both of us. I met my SO, Marshall, and have been with him for 2 years. We currently live together. I have a really great group of friends here, and we all hang out as a group with our SOs and even with our single friends. Marshall and I do plenty of things together, but we also have a lot of time with our friends separately. 


Current Situation: Liz and Chuck got married almost a year ago. Chuck got a job in my city, so he and Liz moved about 30 minutes away from me and Marshall. We were very excited. I have gone out to dinner, shopping, spent time with Liz without Marshall or Chuck. Although I care for Liz a lot, when she moved, I think she expected things to go back to how they were before. 


Marshall and I decided to purchase year passes to a theme park, and they are quite expensive, but Marshall is paying for mine. This is something we enjoying doing together and with our friends.  I suggested that Liz and Chuck get some, too, and we can all go together. She then told me: “Chuck hates theme parks. So if I get one, Marshall will have to stay home when we go. Is he going to be okay with staying home?” 


This bothers me, not because I have to bring Marshall everywhere with me, but because she felt the need to tell me what I need to do or that she felt the need to say it at all. Marshall and I are very welcoming to our other friends and their SOs. We want everyone to feel welcomed. As adults, we feel like this is normal to spend time with our SOs as a group. What do I even say to address this? Or am I wrong for being annoyed?
  
**tl;dr**: Best friend told me I needed to leave my SO home when attending a theme park with her. What should I say to address it, if at all? Should I be annoyed?"

"My [21F] boyfriend [22M] of one year is reacting weirdly about my sister [20F] breaking up with her boyfriend of six months [20sM]


My boyfriend, Aaron, and I have been together for about a year. My sister, Katie, had been dating Brian for about the last six months. It was one of those relationships where Brian was great about 3/4 of the time, but the other 1/4 was bad enough that the other 3/4 wasn't worth it. A few months ago, I told Aaron I was hoping Katie would break up with Brian, because the relationship was so unhealthy and I could see how stressed Katie was. He told me that was a terrible thing to say, and that I should be more optimistic. I figured we would just see what happened.

Katie ended up breaking up with Brian like I figured she should, because she was sick and tired of always having to go behind his back and think two steps ahead of him to strategize and avoid him getting upset over nothing. For instance, he was extremely paranoid, and was convinced that some of Katie's friends hated him. They do hate him now, but only because of how rudely he treated them. He would get upset when Katie would want to visit these friends, so she would have to either argue him down to shut him up or go behind his back. It was really unhealthy.

I do need to say to be fair that I understand why Brian acted the way he did. His parents were horribly unreliable growing up, and he had a very unstable life. But in the end, he would make all these promises to change, then go back to his old ways within a week. Katie gave him plenty of chances.

The reason why I'm posting is that I'm worried about Aaron's reaction to Katie dumping Brian. He keeps bringing up Brian's background, and saying that we don't know if his behavior was malicious or if he was just that messed up from his bad childhood that he didn't know any other way to behave. When Katie told Brian that he should get counseling, Aaron said that was cruel thing to say, but I think that was a real suggestion. 

What is also weird was that his sister once dated a really controlling guy, and he encouraged her to break up with him. He said that was different, because that guy was ""just a dick"" but Brian had some real issues. He's been saying how relationships take work, and it's not right to leave someone for things that aren't their fault. 

I'm hoping this will blow over after it's been awhile since the breakup, but I'm worried about why he seems to feel the need to defend this guy, who he barely knows. I've asked if there is anything else he is worried about, but he insists he just thinks Brian was treated unfairly.

I'm worried about why he seems to think behaving badly is okay as long as you have a good enough excuse for it. Do I have a good reason to be worried? Is this a red flag?

"My family is angry at me [24M] for letting my girlfriend [20F] come with me to my grandma's house as she was on her deathbed.


My grandmother was 92 when she passed away. In the early morning four days ago, I got a call from my dad [70M] that my grandma was at the hospital for a minor cold. He said that I shouldn't worry about it. The next day, my grandma was discharged from the hospital. 

Two days ago, I was out walking in the park with my girlfriend of a few years. This was in the afternoon. Suddenly, I received a call from my brother [34M] telling me to come over to our grandmother's house. Her cold had come back and it was more severe this time.

I asked my girlfriend to come with me for support. By the time we arrived, my whole family: parents, aunts, uncles, brothers, cousins were in the house and hallway. I knew something really serious was happening. My gf stayed in the hallway as I went into her bedroom. My grandma looked really unwell and my dad was crying. I said some things to her. I don't think she heard me but she was holding my hand the whole time.

Two hours later, she passed away. This whole time, my girlfriend was in the house consoling me. She was very supportive and it helped me a lot. But I noticed that she was the only non-family member in the house. 

She left sometime after my grandma passed. I spent the night at the house with my mum and my brothers and uncle/aunt, supporting dad and grandpa. In the morning, my uncle pulled me aside and told me that I should not have brought my girlfriend with me during such a personal family tragedy. He lectured me and said that it was disrespectful to my family to let a stranger come in uninvited, and reminded me that my older brother didn't bring HIS girlfriend over. He thought that it was disrepsectful how I let a ""stranger"" see my father crying and in his most vulnerable moment.

My uncle said that my dad ""probably"" felt the same way and that I should apologize to him. I didn't mention this conversation to my father because he has a lot on his mind right now. My uncle says that other members of our family who were present also think that letting my gf accompany me was very ""unorthodox"".

I asked my mother whether I made a faux pas and she just said that she understood and that we all need somebody to comfort us in difficult times. She thinks my uncle is overreacting.

I don't know what to think...my family has always been very traditional and ""exclusive"" in this sense. For example, we used to spend every Christmas at my grandma's country home. My brothers and I were never allowed to bring our girlfriends/friends over for those things. Even my eldest brother couldnt bring over his GF (now wife) until they were engaged. 

Should I apologize to my family for bringing my girlfriend in during that intimate time? Were my actions rude? Or was what I did justifiable under the circumstances.

TL;DR: Brought GF over to my grandma's house when she was dying. Later my uncle (and presumably other family members) think that her presence was rude and unnecessary..."

I'm not sure what sub this belongs in, so apologies if this doesn't fit. 

I When I was a child my mother and father both beat me when I was 'naughty' even when I didn't think I was misbehaving. Beatings included being backed into a corner and repeatedly kicked, me and my brother having our heads banged together so hard I'd have a lump for days, my father would always wait at the bottom of the stairs screaming at me to get to my room and as I walked past he'd kick me in the back so hard I'd scream and fall forwards and I always remember being so sore afterwards for a long time. I remember a lot of them very very vividly, I have a good memory and remember things almost like video clips that I can replay whenever I like. 

It seems silly that for many years I never really thought about it but now as an adult I find myself thinking about it more and more frequently, replaying them over in my head and getting very upset. I'm crying as I type this now. I get on well with both parents now although we're not a close family and they've been divorced since I was 15 or so, I don't see either of them often. 

I need some advice from people who have been in similar situations maybe. Do I speak to my parents despite me not wanting to ruin the civil relationship I have with them now or how can I try get over it? 

TL;DR haven't thought about being beaten as a kid for a very long time but I'm finding it's affecting me a lot now. How do I move forwards? "

"throwaway obviously, I (23m) am pretty slight of build, and have a higher pitched voice but I'm hetero. Pretty much every one thinks I'm gay at first, but my new boss (50sM) refuses to believe me and won't stop hitting on me. He's about a year from his pension and I don't want ruin anything.


So yeah throwaway obviously. I've been mistaken for being gay since I was little, but I'm very much into women. 

I just graduated college and got a job for an awesome company. There's an older generation of workers who are on a defined benefits plan so they get a set pension when they retire. My boss is one of these people and he's worked for this company since he was 16 years old and retired in one year. 

Well he literally hits on me all the time, at first I thought he was like a ""macho I'm hetero but smack my buds on the ass in the locker room"" guy but then I found out he's Gay and that all his talk is serious. I've told him i have girlfriends and he says he doesn't believe it. I told him directly in writing he makes me uncomfortable. But for example, He told me today he's going to ""drag me out of closet with his mouth and I better hope he doesn't leave teeth marks."" 

I've had an off the record talk with our HR department and they said if I file a complaint he'd be fired and after a board hearing, would almost certainly lose his pension. I don't want to be the one to ruin 40+ years of his life and his future by squealing.

Honestly, I can take it for another year but I feel like I should do the right thing...I don't know what the right thing is.
