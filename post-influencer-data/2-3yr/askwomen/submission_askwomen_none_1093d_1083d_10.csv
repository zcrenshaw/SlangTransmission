Hi women of reddit! I'm in my early 20s and I have trouble with self-esteem. I was wondering if anyone has noticed whether it appears to get better as you get older. Has anything helped you? 

Thanks girls â™¡

Edit: I would just like to say thank you for all the kind words and encouragement that everyone has posted. I hope we all have taken something from this and feel a sense of community also. I definitely have felt a lot better about being myself and embracing who I am after reading all of your posts."
