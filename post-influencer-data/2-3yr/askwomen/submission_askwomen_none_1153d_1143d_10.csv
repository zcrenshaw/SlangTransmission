I know this is generally a thread for guys to gain some insight (EDIT: I was wrong), but I'm a 19 year old girl behind the curve.

Most threads that cover this feature very clipped comments like ""Step 1. Sign up for Tinder/any dating site/whatever...Walk into a bar...Exist Step 2. Sex"" or ""Basic hygiene. Don't be hideous."" which is about as unhelpful as anything could be.

So, I guess: how do Tinder interactions go? Who messages first? What's IN a first message? How do you suss out who you'll sleep with from Tinder? How do you suss out who you'll sleep with in a bar? What does that interaction look like in a bar? Do you literally just go to a guy's house/apartment/cardboard box/whatever? How are you not embarrassed? What do you do after? God, what do you do with your HANDS?

Maybe this would be better off in r/ExplainLikeImFive, ha."
