0,"Asked little brother (8) if he knew I was gay. Got the cutest response.


Just a bit of context for you, my parents don't really talk about the whole gay thing with my brother. And in schools, they don't teach him about sexual orientation. So, he's heard the term gay before, and I didn't think he really knows what that means.

So just the other day, curiosity got to me, and he was watching TV. So I sat down on the couch and I asked him, ""you know I'm gay right don't you dude?"" And he looked up and said ""yeah?""

So I asked him, ""what does that mean?"" And he said, ""you date boys."" So I really wanted to see if he truly understood, and I asked, ""mommy dates boys. Does that mean she's gay?"" 

And he said, ""no."" And I asked him, ""why not?""

He replied, ""because mommy's not a diva, like you.""

Took me a good half hour to stop laughing."
1,"I've killed my boyfriend's miniature rose bonsai tree he's had since he was 14, and he's coming home tomorrow


He's been on an extended break with his friends for the last 3 weeks because he's been saving holiday from work and his Uni term ended a while ago. He asked that while he was away I stay in his apartment and keep his masses of plants alive (4 bonsai trees, 12 potted plants, 3 moss geraniums, 2 marimo, 7 tiny cacti and 3 air plant geraniums he hangs from his lights), I said it was fine because most of his plants are pretty low maintenance. He said I was okay to have friends over, but specifically asked me to be very careful around the bonsai because they're delicate.

I feel the need to push that this thing is his *baby*. He's 21 and so has had it for *7 years*. He carefully prunes away at it every morning, spritzes it with water constantly and is always checking it's okay throughout the day, talking to it even. He's a typical doting plant owner.

Last week, I had two guys around to drink and play video games, and we ended up getting a little too drunk. I tripped over while getting up to switch a cartridge, and ended up knocking the bonsai over. The pot smashed, dirt went everywhere and one of the branches snapped. I wasn't too concerned at first, I clipped where the branch had snapped, replaced the pot and just carried on watering it as usual.

A week later, it's dead. 100%. It's shed all of it's blossom, all of it's leaves, the ends of the branches are curling up and it's roots are all turning black. I don't know what to do. 

I obviously have to tell him it's died before he gets back, but I don't know whether I should tell him it's my fault or if that's going to make it worse. What do?"
2,"Help me understand. Conservatives tend to hate guys being feminine, but Trump is like the biggest diva ever.


I really don't get it. Trump is a bigger diva than any of my feminine gay friends. He's really obsessive about his looks, his feelings are easily hurt, he needs all his stuff to be super shiny, he needs constant validation by huge numbers of people. I'd say he's one pocket dog away from being Mariah Carey, but Mariah seems like way less of a diva.

Why are conservatives making such an exception for him on something they usually hate?"
3,"Is it just me, or has Reddit been regressing when it comes to homophobia, racism, etc. over the last few years?


When I first joined Reddit around 2012, the site seemed decidedly progressive. It seems mostly to have been nerdy, socially liberal college kids or graduates. However, I feel like over the last two years or so,  I'm seeing a whole lot more anti-gay and racist sentiments expressing on posts that reach the front page. This precedes the current US election and the rise of /r/the_donald. 

Earlier this week, I saw people defending conversion therapy, arguing that homosexuality is a mental illness caused by childhood sexual abuse, and claiming that because recent polls show we only represent 3% of the population, we are a ""vocal minority trying to impose our lifestyle on the majority."" Thes are views that I never would have thought I'd see on Reddit outside of certain corners of the site. 

Has anyone else noticed a decided shift in recent years on this site?"

5,"Is being gay ""not that big a deal"" for you?


Hopefully this doesn't get *too* much hate, but I was wondering if for other people, being gay isn't really a big part of your life or isn't ""that big of a deal for you."" For me, it's like other things like ethnicity, height, foot size, eye color, etc that is a ""physical/biological"" (for lack of a better word) *fact* about me, but says nothing about me as a person (personality, hobbies, etc). To quote Connor Franta, ""it's a part of me, it's not all of me,"" and if I would write a list of how I would describe myself or my ""traits,"" I don't think that it would be in the top 10 (similarly with height, eye color, etc). I'm pretty sure that there is a wide spectrum of how ""relevant"" it is for different people, but it always feels weird that for me, it seems almost irrelevant, and especially when I try being more a part of the ""community,"" a lot of times I feel like I don't really belong. "
6,"This is not really a question,but sometimes I hate being a gaymer.


I hate to say it because I am thankful that I am attracted to men and I am very proud of myself being gay.

But I do.

I played dota 2 for a while,and I've heard the word faggot and the phrase 'eat shit and die homo' so many times I'm almost used to it.I don't know why people do that.I really don't.I guess it's just part of being straight.

Also I tend to mod the game a lot before I play them,and sometimes it's really tiring trying to find mods that I like.For example,When I tried to play fallout 4,I had to look very hard to find mods that were for male characters.When you browse websites like nexus mods,it's all boobs and pussies and hairstyle for female characters.

And you know they are all for straight guys.There are like 2 or 3 mods in the ocean of 'more hairstyles for females' and 'vivid pink vagina and absurdly huge tits'.I'm not saying that I need the same mods for male characters because I don't really need sex content in video games.

But I swear sometimes it's almost exhausting being a gaymer in a world filled with straight guys.

I'm not sad,I'm just tired."
7,"My Ex just came out, and I’m pretty upset.


So a few years ago this guy messages me on Facebook with a compliment. I noticed we had a mutual friend, so I kept talking to him. At first I thought he was just a friendly guy, but as he started messaging me daily, I figured maybe he was interested in me romantically. I’m not one to beat around the bush, so I straight up messaged him asking if he was into me that way, and he didn’t reply for like a whole day, but when he did, he basically said yes. We decided to meet up at a restaurant, we got to talking, and it became obvious that this guy was deeply buried in the closet. But I was very attracted to him, and he had this childlike innocence about him that made it difficult for me to think rationally. We started seeing each other in secret, and I was falling very hard for him. I then started putting a little pressure on him to come out, because I wasn’t enjoying the secrecy thing at all. Whenever I brought it up though, this guy would literally cry to me about how he just can’t do it.

Well after about a couple years of hiding, I ended things because I couldn’t do it anymore. A month after breaking it off, this guy decides not only to come out, but to parade around his new boyfriend. I’m hurt, but more than that, I’m pissed. I feel like I'm owed an apology of some sort. I wasted 2 years of my life on the asshole.

8,"Anyone else prefer stories to porn?


As per title - I'm not into lengthy erotic literature, but I find that /r/gaystoriesgonewild usually does *much* more for me than, say, /r/broslikeus or /r/gaygifs. Read a lot about how men are very sexually visual, but that doesn't seem to be the case for me - anyone else?"
