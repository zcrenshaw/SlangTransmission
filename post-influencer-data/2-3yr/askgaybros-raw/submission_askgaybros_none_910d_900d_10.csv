2,"[UPDATE] Realizing I have feelings for a good friend... he thinks I don't like him though.


I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/60lh6l/realizing_i_have_feelings_for_a_good_friend_he/) yesterday.

I sat down my friend ""Adam"" last night. He responded to my texts finally and he wasn't really upset with me for what I said at all. He just thought he was annoying me with his relationship woes so he wanted some space.

I go to pick him up and we get to our usual coffee place. We really get lost in our conversations in person to the point where we forget there are people around us. We were holding up the line. This lady told us the line was moving and I don't know why or how but I subconsciously grabbed his hand as we moved forward. I didn't even notice I did it until he brought it up. I didn't even flinch or reel it back in. I literally felt it when I let go of his hand. Fuck.

We ordered our coffee and got our stuff and continued talking. I wanted to kiss him right there and then and seal the deal but I couldn't find it in me to do it.

Someone mentioned just kissing him in the comments. I was going to do that but I kept holding back. It wasn't until he asked me what was up that I just spilled over that I have feelings. He was like, ""oh we all do."" I said, ""for you.""

It was awkward for a moment. He was deep in thought. Adam's the type of guy who's extremely thoughtful. He can be a bit slow to the draw but that's the way he thinks. It's not linear by any means, I could see him putting two and two together. His lips tracing together silent thoughts until they shaped together a smile (I'm so sorry for the descriptions, I get artsy when I'm in love.)

We just keep talking. I'm relieved and he's lit up. He briefly asks me when and how I started feeling the way I did before taking back the question for himself. He says he's liked me since a long while ago before we reconnected and that I was his high school crush (which shocks me because we never interacted all that much.) Then it's back to Star Wars fan theories and chit-chat about work.

As soon as we get back to the car, it's ON. Before I could even get my seatbelt in, Adam lunges at me for a kiss. We made out for 10 minutes straight. We get home and ~~fuck each other's brains out~~ get some rest.

Now it's 1 in the afternoon, we're headed out for brunch. Luckily, we're roughly the same size in clothes. He really needs to wear more casual clothes.

**Tl;dr**: In usual r/askgaybros fashion, I probably should have just told my friend I liked him. I did. We fucked. I feel like shit though because this ordeal felt like a common sense thing. Thanks!"

4,"Evangelical Christians more anti-gay than Muslims, Survey Finds


According to a 2014 Pew Research Center study, American Muslims are less disapproving of homosexuality than American Evangelical Christians. This is in response to a post I saw earlier about how the Muslims are ""out to get us"". There are way more Evangelical Christians in the US than Muslims, and they are more anti-gay. Let's stop generalizing Islam.

[Is mostly this](http://imgur.com/a/fnhBp)

I mean not all of it. That's like 30-40%. The other 60% I'm sure most of you understand, like getting hit up from guys who are like 4000 miles away or people who just wanted to trade/collect pics and never do anything else.

But holy fucking shit if I get one more message like this...

I guess it'll just be like another Tuesday or something. Please don't do this to other black guys, people. Unless, I guess, you find those specific guys who are advertising for it. It's fucked up."
