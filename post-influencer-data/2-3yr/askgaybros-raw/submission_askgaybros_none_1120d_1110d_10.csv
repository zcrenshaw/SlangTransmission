0,"""Fags don't lift weights.""


About two weeks ago at my gym an older man got upset with me because I was super setting on two pieces of equipment at once. While I was mid-set on barbell shoulder press, he started to yell at me, call me a punk, etc. He used several curse words so I decided to grab the manager. When he saw the manager come over, another old man who was not even involved in the initial altercation runs over and starts telling the manager how I am the worst guy in the gym because I hog all the equipment, and all the old men agree that I should be kicked out.

Well I decided to tell the old man who decided to get involved to lower his voice and stop shouting because he was causing a scene and everybody was looking. The old man then says, ""What are you even doing at the gym? You're a fag. Fags don't lift weights."" I was taken aback because I have never really encountered blatant homophobia right in my face before. The manager was standing right next to me when all this happened, and he asked the man to leave, but the man refused and was allowed to stay.

I called corporate and told them the story and two weeks later the gym's general manger has finally gotten back to me. In the meantime this same man has called me a fag for using the gender neutral bathroom and has threatened to beat me up twice, claiming he's a martial arts instructor and professional fighter who makes 100 thousand dollars a year. Keep in mind I am pretty muscular and can bench 350 and squat 450. He can't even do unassisted pull-ups.

I told the general manger I am not comfortable with him at that gym and that they can have his membership or mine. I think I am going to tweet the corporate Twitter handle to make them aware of what happened. Am I doing the right thing, or should I just change gyms and move on?

To;dr: got told by an angry old man that fags can't lift and corporate won't revoke his membership. Should I launch a social media crusade?"

2,"Boyfriend of 2 years has AIDS and knew it


My boyfriend had been sick for several months. He went to the doctor multiple times and they couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, he got so sick that I took him to the emergency room. This was a month ago. The doctor in the emergency room ordered an HIV test without asking him and it came back positive. My mind was blown. He had told me that at one of the doctor visits a week ago, they gave him a test and it was negative. I didn't ask him to get a test when we stopped using condoms because he told me he was tested three months before we met. We lived together for 1.5 years. I just didn't understand how this could be true. The next day I got the bill from that doctor's visit and there was no charge for a test. I later found out that he actually declined an HIV test and told the doctor he had been recently tested. At this point, I start to get suspicious so I spent several hours looking through his phone. I saw the most disgusting things you can imagine. My hands shook as I looked. I found out he cheated on me with strangers from Craigslist, traded dirty pics with guys he worked with, grabbed a guys junk at a store, and much more. I also found out that he had been to bathhouses before we met. He had told me he had never heard of a bathhouse. He hooked up with guys that had boyfriends on a regular basis before we met. He had even told me he had never had anal sex but there were videos of him getting fucked without a condom. The story just gets worse.  I recently found out that he infected an ex boyfriend. The ex said he assumed my boyfriend told me that he is positive. The ex also said that my boyfriend knew he had it when he gave it to him too. Strangely, the ex has forgiven him and they are still friends. Maybe that makes it easier to deal with, but I can't forgive this. I have been through a roller coaster of emotions. Rage. Hatred. Sadness. Empathy. I can understand him being evil and selfish and putting my health at risk, but why he would put his own at risk and not take a pill? I just don't get it. He is still in ICU and I haven't even been able to speak to him because he has been on a vent for the last three weeks. Now that he is off the vent, he has delirium from being in ICU for so long. I feel like I need to talk to him to get closure. He thinks I've been there when I haven't and is very confused. I am told that the confusion will go away when he gets out of ICU. My point of writing this is to warn you all that you can't trust anyone and you should make absolutely sure that person has been tested.  Use condoms.  Always. Get on PrEP.  I don't know how I will ever trust anyone again. 

Edit:  I forgot to add that I am negative.  We haven't had sex in four months.  I took two OraQuick and one blood test. Thank god he is a bottom. Also, we didn't have sex much.  That was the only problem I had with our relationship.  Now I think he might have been trying to protect me.  So strange.  "
3,"My husband is BFF with my sister. Her new boyfriend told me to tell him to dial back stay away.


So me and my now husband have been together for 5 years and we married earlier this year. He is a very effeminate guy and likes to do girl things with girls. Very quickly he became friends with my little sister and I'd say in the past 3 years they've been BFFs. They hang out, go shopping, spas, watch movies, etc together all the time.

I always liked and encouraged it. My sister has always struggled to make close trusting friendships and this has been very good for her, and as for my husband I very much like him to be BFFs with my sister than someone I can't know anywhere near as well.

So my sister's new boyfriend (6 months or so) came to me and told me that he feels threatened by my husband's friendship with her and he wants me to tell him to dial back and stay away from her for a while. I told him that I don't control my husband and their friendship is between them and suggested that he should talk to his girlfriend instead which he told me ""he doesn't wanna seem like a controlling insecure jealous guy"" which is funny as he was expecting me to be just those things! He also said ""your husband will listen to you if you tell him to do that"" which I didn't like. I gave him a no answer and ended the conversation but I don't know if I should do anything else, like give my sister a heads up or something. "
4,"My buddy just showed me his boner


Asked if he could ask my honest opinion after he offered me a back rub and took off his pants while we were chilling last night. I said sure and in that split second I knew I was about to a dick. Sure enough he thumbs out his giant thick uncut dick right in front of me and I just stared at it speechlessly. Then tells me it's ""not even hard"" which I could definitely tell was a lie. He got a little weirded out and put it away, told me not to tell anyone and we kicked it for a while longer. His bulge was still fucking huge. Now I'm hard as shit trying to figure out what the fuck to do lol. I wanted that D. He's asleep in my bed and I'm hard in my garage smoking cigarettes and could use some advice

This is my first ever post on reddit "
5,"Just came out to my mexican dad


It was fucking horrible. Before i decided to come out, i knew that there was going to be a 99% chance that he was going to get mad and upset, and i expected that. Our culture tends to be very reserved and close minded and very religious.Btw, Im a 24 year old guy who just became a nurse. 

Before I started, i told him that what I was about to tell him might upset him and that I didn't want him to get mad. I told him that I was gay and that I didn't choose to be this way. There was a slight pause from him and he basically said ""What kind of bullshit is this, what that fuck is going on in your mind? You are fucking stupid and disgusting. Is this what they teach you in school. Is that why you have friends. What are you thinking?"" 

I started fucking crying and tearing up. It was so hard for me to get any words out. I told him he should be proud of me that I graduated school and that I am the first in the family to do something with his life. He ended saying that I'm a disappointment to him. He then shouted and asked what was the point of me telling him. I replied, because I respected him and wanted him to find out from his own son rather then from someone else. Then he proceeded to say that If i respect him that I should just pack my things and get the fuck out of his house. 

At that point I balled my eyes out and went to my room. That hurts so much to have to hear that from your own father. I was furious. I started packing my things, but my mom told me to stay, she said that If i leave shell be heartbroken. 

Im sorry I'm just ranting an venting. Its a really crappy feeling to be going through this. I didn't realize it was going to be this hard. :("
6,"Boyfriend of six months cheated


Hi AskGayBros, I need some insight on how to cope with emotions from recently being cheated on. Yesterday my boyfriend and I were doing final preparations for our three day backpacking trip and I unplugged his phone to put it in a plastic baggy as it's supposed to rain one of the days we'll be backpacking. My thumbprint unlocked my boyfriend's phone (at request of my boyfriend, he wanted me to have one) and it opened to some text messages. I skimmed the words ""want you wrapped in my arms"" and did a double take. I read a paragraph describing what this guy wanted to do to my boyfriend. I'm at a loss for words and I hear my boyfriend walk down the stairs.

I ask him who this person is and my boyfriend just stares at me. After asking him twice more, I find out it's his ex from a year ago. This ex lives 800 miles away in Florida and cheated on him over a year ago - they had a long distance relationship and met online. Long story short, I confirm that he's cheating and immediately tell him ""We're not going on the camping and we're no longer dating. You have two hours to move out."" I grab my keys and go outside for some air really quick. I come back inside and tell him I deserve closure and want to read the texts. He tries to say something, but hands me his phone. 

I open his phone not even ten minutes after breaking up with him he sends a text to his ex saying:
&gt;""So-and-So saw all the texts. We're not dating anymore. I'm all yours.""

I stare at the screen and scroll all the way up, finding out that they've been texting since Sunday and that it's the reason my boyfriend has been staying up late. The texts consist of nudes from his ex and my boyfriend-now ex telling him he loves him. It sorta just hollowed out my insides. They talked every single night and day since Sunday.

So he calls his friend and moves out. I ask him what lie he's going to tell people when they ask why we're no longer dating. He says, and I quote ""That you saw texts from my ex. I don't lie."" I laugh and ask him if he's serious. I've been noticing that he's been annoyed recently and that something seemed wrong, so consistently for the last few days I was asking him if everything was alright and if he wanted to talk about something. He told me that everything was fine.

I feel gutted. I don't know how to handle these emotions. It all feels so personal and I really liked the guy. It doesn't make any sense to me as he was telling me how amazing our relationship was and how much he liked me the night before I found out. 

What do I do? I really liked him and it was an incredible relationship in my eyes.

TL;DR: Boyfriend cheated, I broke up with him and kicked him out, he sent a text  right after to his ex that cheated on him saying ""So-and-So saw all the texts. We're not dating anymore. I'm all yours."""

8,"Boyfriend can't wait to date the ""love of his life"", got shot down and now wants me back, ""love of my boyfriends life now interested in me


My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years now and have been living together for one. Everything seemed to be picture perfect. It was like one of those gay relationship success stories you tell, but all of that changed.

My boyfriend comes home and sits down with me to share some ""Wonderful news"". The ""love of his life"" has become single and he wants to try and date him

Here's how the conversation played out.

BF: ""so he's single now and I want to give it a shot and see if he would date me""

Me: ""so we're breaking up""

BF: ""NO NO NO! Only if we date and things get really serious between us would I break up with you""

Me: ""you know how insane this sounds right?""

BF: ""No, everyone has a love of their life, don't you?""

Me: ""Well I thought I was looking at him"" 

BF: ""awe that's sweet, but I mean someone you've always wanted to date""

Me: ""I'm with him right now""

BF: ""who me? Wow!""

Me: ""so we're breaking up""

BF: ""no, maybe I don't know, I have to see if we wants me, he's so perfect for me"" 

After that I walk out of the room and cry in shower (sue me, my boyfriend was a twatbag)

About a day later bump into my friend, who is coincidentally the ""love of my boyfriends life"" friend too.

Friend: ""so BF tried to ask out LL""

Me: ""yeah he told me he would""

Friend: ""LL shot him down, like hard""

Me: ""Good""

Friend: ""are you gonna stay?""

Me: "" I don't know, probably not""

Friend: "" leave him, you don't deserve that""

After that conversation I come home to find my boyfriend looking typical and we begin to talk

Me: ""so I heard LL shot you down""

BF: ""yeah, had to try I guess *nervous laugh*""

Me: ""you know what? I'm really glad you did that""

BF: ""Me too, because I realized you're the one for me and I want to spend my life with you""

Me: ""oh no not cause of that, it's because I saw your true colors, anyone who does what you did to their boyfriend shouldn't be dating""

BF: ""why are you mad!? He rejected me""

Me: ""the damage has been done. scumbag""

I then begin to move my stuff into the second bedroom of our apartment and tell my boyfriend I'll be moving out by October. He starts sobbing, getting on his knees and apologizing. I'm surprisingly unfazed. 

A couple of nights later I'm out at the club with my friend I mentioned earlier, he wants to introduce me to someone, I hesitantly agreed. It turns out to be the famous LL. Who tells me how much of an asshole my boyfriend is and I deserve better, standard lines and all that shit.

Then this happened.

LL: I'm surprised he'd want to leave someone as beautiful as you.

Me: ""yeah but no matter how pretty you are guys can be scumbags""

LL: ""he's a dumbass for losing a great thing, but his loss is someone else's gain""

We sticked close the entire night, I can't believe it, this guy was attractive, amazing, and I can't believe I'm with him instead of my ex ... Wtf?

Things actually got hot and heavy between us and we decided to take it to the bedroom, he wanted to go to his place but I insisted mine

So, the next morning, after our fornication, my now ex boyfriend opens the door to MY room, unexpectedly, and he finds myself and LL. He immediately goes to the bathroom to cry, I follow him.

BF: ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME!?!?!""

Me: ""yeah, he's actually interested in me instead of you, go figure""

BF: ""unintelligible blubbering""

Me: ""Karma is a bitch ain't it?""

After that LL and I go out for lunch and my ex boyfriend is blowing up my phone, threatens suicide and I text him a number to the suicide hotline.

LL says he has ambitions of dating me and I tell him I'm excited to see where things go.

How in the fuck do I handle my ex?

TL:DR :Boyfriend can't wait to date the ""love of his life"", got shot down and now wants me back, ""love of my boyfriends life now interested in me
