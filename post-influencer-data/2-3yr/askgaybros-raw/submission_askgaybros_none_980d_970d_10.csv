0,"I'm so fucking happy and i need to share it


Met my boyfriend a year ago today. We celebrated our first anniversary and it was incredible. Had a great dinner, saw a great movie, it was so much fun. At the end of the night he told me he couldn't think of anyone better to spend his year with.

I know 2016 was a bad year for many, but so far it was the greatest year of my life, because I got to spend it with him.

Hes next to me sleeping right now. I never thought I'd get this far with someone. God I love him.

Have a good night, everyone!

Edit: why exactly am I getting downvoted for saying I'm happy and just had an amazing anniversary day with my boyfriend?

Edit2: well now my first edit just looks foolish ðŸ˜…"
1,"[Rant] Some of you younger gaybros need to get your shit together.


Seriously, being an 18 year old virgin is not the end of the world. You don't need to be drunk texting people on Grindr looking for some hot str8 masc guy to come fill your hole. Stop being so careless and use protection. Most of you aren't even looking for sex, what you're looking for is attention. Attention that you aren't getting since you went off to college and moved out of your parents house. "
2,"Last Words on Obama.


Obama is about to sign off in 15min. When Obama was first elected I was a super closeted black kid in the middle of Kansas. Frankly, I felt I had no hope. Then this guy pops in the picture. A guy who look like me. A guy who was eloquent, strong, and intelligent. A man who told me that the attribute that my family and friends told me was evil and disgusting was actually a piece of me that deserved to be celebrated, appreciated and most of all respected. In my estimation of his presidency he had mistakes, but I truly believe he tried to do right by America. I will always thank him for instilling in me, like he instilled in many Americans, a lasting courage, a lasting hope.  "
3,"How did you pursue your boyfriend?


I usually get coffee near campus if I'm going to study and I usually don't pay attention to the baristas, I'm kind of socially awkward . But one day I saw a cute guy and I was taken aback. I didn't even know if he was gay or not. I decided I needed to grow balls and score a date somehow( at least try). 

So I started to go more often and I would always tip him and then after a couple times we had small talk while I ordered. He got a haircut and I told him that I liked guys with tose haircuts and then I started noticing the discounted coffee.  then one day his coworker (he wasn't there) told me that I was hella thirsty and I told her she was just mad I wasn't flirting with her(shut her up quick) 

But all the macho bravado was a cover i was really nervous because I'd get butterflies around this guy. So I asked my best friend what to do and he said (verbatim): stop being a little bitch"" so I stopped being a little bitch ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚that same week I went and got coffee and he asked me how my day was and I said it was bad because I wanted to go paintballing but had no one to go with ðŸ˜œ(cue puppy face) hehe and asked if he would go with me. 

So of course I picked him up and went paintballing( I was super touchy and protective on the date) and then fucked him in my dorm like two weeks later( after teasing him) . I felt like such a man after that day. now we're celebrating our anniversary soon. 
How did your relationship start?"
4,"Caught boyfriend in bed with best friend


We're WERE in a monogamous relationship. I come home this afternoon to find my best friend balls deep in my boyfriend. I was tipped off by the sound of my boyfriend screaming. 

They just stared at me. The ex boyfriend said ""oh shit"" and the best friend grabbed his clothes and left. 

I asked the cheater what possessed him to go find a dick that wasn't mine and he was mad at me for not putting out in two days. He is now at the club, getting plastered and said he doesn't know if he can be faithful if I can't provided every time he wants it.

His name is not on my lease and we just moved in together. I'm thinking of shipping him back to his parents where he previously resided. "

We don't want to out you, but I'm genuinely curious how many people here are view-only? 

Go ahead and make a disposable account if you have to, but for the record you're safe... You can use this as your first step out of the closet."
6,"MY DAD WHO DOESNT KNOW I'M GAY JUST CAME HOME WHILE I HAD A RANDOM GRINDR HOOKUP OVER FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK


literally the first time I've ever hosted ever and my dad pulls in right when we start fucking. Had to make up some bullshit story about how its a friend from school and I didn't even know the guys name. Not even sure what to tell the grindr guy this is so weird god fucking dammit. "
7,"Everyone's forgotten I'm bi


I'm definitely bisexual but I lean more towards women. I came out to my family and friends a year and a half ago, and they took it really well. Now I'm thinking they were just humoring me

Last weekend I told my parents I'd like them to meet my boyfriend and they just stared at me wide eyed and mouth open with confusion. My mom asked since when was I gay and my dad just told me to stop playing games. 

They claim to have no recollection of me ever coming out as bi. Same story with my friends. It's frustrating but I can partially understand why. I came out right after getting out of a long term relationship with my girlfriend at the time, and then I got into another relationship with a girl soon after. 

Even then it still amuses me that everyone I told has forgotten. I don't think I could forget a friend or a sibling coming out as gay or bi. I literally sat my parents down and told them. I invited my friends over and told them while they were all sober. 
Yet somehow no one remembers. "

10,"[UPDATE] Met my long distance boyfriend for the first time.


https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5d3mya/hopefully_this_will_work_out/?st=IXT1JHS0&amp;sh=58096161

I wrote a post awhile back about me being skeptical in a long distance relationship. 

A little background: we started connecting in mid October through Scruff. It was just a random thing. He's in the Midwest and I'm here in Florida. He found me and decided to say hi. We text and FaceTime daily until last weekend he flew to Florida to meet me for his birthday. 

We connected very well over the phone. I can confidently say that we carry that same connection in person. He spent 4 days with me. We did beachy and couple stuff. Lots of cuddling and chatting. Maybe a little more than cuddling, but nothing beyond BJs. He couldn't keep his hands off of me for the most part (love a man that doesn't afraid to show affections). Since he works in retails, he can't get holidays off. However, he plans to see me again for Mardi Gras. 

I will probably do another update post when we see each other again! Thanks for reading. Have a cheerful day!"
