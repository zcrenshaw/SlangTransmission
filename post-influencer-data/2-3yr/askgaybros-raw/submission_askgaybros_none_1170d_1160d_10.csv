0,"My buddy got murdered


This is my first post on Reddit (I always read this sub, helped me a lot, thank you), in fact my first post in English, so I apologize for the mistakes. I don’t have anyone to speak about it, because I’m in the closet and after this events I am more reluctant to come out. 

I am a 20 years old man, who lives in South America, recently I moved to a big city and because of my personality I did not make any friends. I’m a very quiet guy, my hobbies are listen to obscure indie music, hit the gym, go running, reading, playing MOBAs; anything that I can do by myself.

A few months ago I was jogging at the park when I saw a guy with a really cute dog, so I started petting the dog and some casual conversation with this guy. At that moment I guessed he was gay, and we had a really good talk, he was from the same city that I came, so I gave my number to him and we spend weeks talking to each other.
We started to go jogging together and it was really nice, one day he invited me to go to his home and I agreed. We became more than friends, that was new to me and I was enjoying it, I never ever been this intimate with a man. He gave me a cute nickname, it was so great when a I saw new messages from him, I kept waiting them like a fool.

We didn’t have so much in common: he was a 24 years old short guy out of the closet, with a lot of friends and a very promising career; I am kind of lost, just working to pay rent and doing my best to be fine. But we both liked travel, and he had plans to move from the country and one night while I was his big spoon he invited me to go with him, I didn’t take it seriously but I thought “Yeah, that would be nice, in fact, THIS is nice.” I was happy.
Last time I saw him he was distant, said that was worried about the trip, he was going back to our city to his brother graduation. I didn’t understand why, I just hugged him all the time that I could. It was very weird; I am not the kind of clingy guy, but that day I just wanted to keep him safe in my arms. We said good bye and I kissed him on the forehead and said “I call you”. But I didn’t. I was ill all week, and I knew he was having a good time with his family so I was focused in getting better. 

Yesterday I got a call from one of his closest friends and he told me that he died. He was stabbed in a party. I couldn’t believe, I just turned off the phone and checked the online newspaper. For a moment I didn’t find anything, I was so relived.  Then I saw his picture; it was like being punched in the stomach.

Today I went jogging alone and was awful. The trees are there, the fucking people there, everything looks normal, but something is wrong. I saw his face again, again and again on the newspapers around the city, and made me feel sick. Now he is a statistic, people are just arguing if it was homophobia or not. 
I just don’t know what to do. The cell is ringing, but I know this time it's not him."
1,"Tonight I burned my suicide note.


Its time to let go of my past and continue to live. I can't keep being scared of what may happen when I do come out to my family. Tonight my Bf and I got together and I told him I want to burn my suicide note. He smiled and said ""lets do it and now I know you are truly happy"". I'm going to get myself through college and find my own place. I'm going to face every trigger that my PTSD tries to stop me with. I'm going to defeat my shadows that create this depression.
I have a mother who loves me unconditionally. I have a loving boyfriend who reminds me that I am not alone. I have friends who tought me that its okay to trust again. I have a roof over my head. I have a cat who can be loving and bitchy at the same time. I have a working car. I'm going to the college of my dream. I have two legs, two eyes, and a healthy body. I still have my dad in my life. I have people who love me. 

I am thankful for everything that I have and I just want to tell some one else who is struggling with depression that you are LOVED and you are not ALONE."

STOP PURSUING YOUR STRAIGHT FRIEND. IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND PROBABLY CREEPY."
3,"Am I the only one who thinks the extension of our community acronym is getting ludicrous. LGBTTQQIAPP? SERIOUSLY?


Also, it seems every day people are making up a new sexuality. It's almost as if some people just aren't happy until they feel 'different' to everyone else. Demisexual - come on that's not a thing? It basically just means you don't like one nights stands!

5,"Sex with straight crushes only leads to more misery


The thing is, when it does happen, you're rejoiced. I know I did my best to please him in every way. The problem happens when  he goes berserk after the deed, like he sacrificed his manhood and he no longer knows who he is. it ruins the image of the guy you swoon over. 

I wouldn't recommend to anybody. I don't know about anybody's personal experience. Mine was: The guy you sleep with isn't going to do a 180, come out as gay and be your knight in shining armor. Instead he'll cross you as a mistake, probably never want to speak to you again and you're left crying your eyes out.

I had to stop being immature and realize there are gay men worth fighting for instead of wishing for something that will never happen. "
6,"An Open Letter to /r/gaybros


Perhaps this is the wrong venue for this, or maybe I'll find that most of you disagree with what I have to say, but I thought it was worth saying:

On the front page of /r/gaybros this morning, you may have seen a post decrying the type of content that gets upvoted on /r/gaybros.  Many of the participants there noted their distaste for how news on activities such as ""drag"" got more attention from the populous than other more masculine activities, such as sports and shooting.

Many of the people argued that the sub was founded exclusively for the ""masculine"" portion of Reddit's gay male population, noting a lack of a space for them in other LGBT-focused subs.  While I am not sure if this is true, arguing the values of that quickly turned one user to call me a ""~~fucking~~ faggot,"" receiving multiple upvotes.  Other people in the thread were quick to label other feminine gay men with labels like ""fairy"" and ""rainbow gays."" Some users even noted that these people have not even been shown masculinity in their lives and this sub had the duty to show it to them-- whatever that means.

My message to that sub, and this one as well, is that these are not the kind of divisions we should live behind.  In fact, it's almost exactly the same kind that have been kept between the gay community and the rest of the world for decades.  The illusion that there is some kind of division between ""us"" and ""them"" to the point where ""masculine"" gay people feel like a different breed seems almost silly to me.  Masculinity is so incredibly subjective that we could spend hours upon hours trying to quantify it.  This distinction is almost completely in our heads.

The name-calling and berating does absolutely nothing for the cause.  While some may disdain the concept of a ""safe space,"" a subreddit called ""gaybros"" should at least command the respect for every person's sexuality. Yes- that means ""faggot"" and whatever other words were thrown around in junior high are still slurs and have not lost any facet of their meanings.  Being gay does not absolve you of being offensive or an asshole.

For the main problem that the thread was dwelling on, I offer two solutions.  The first being that this users simply reclaim their sub.  You like video games?  Make a post about.  See a cool post about guns?  Upvote that.  There's plenty of room on one subreddit for all of your interests.  The gay community, although it may not appear so on the outside, is diverse beyond imagination.  You are not alone in your interests.

My second solution is to look outward.  There are plenty of other, non-LGBT subreddits that harbor those same interests as well.  There are most certainly gay people there, as well.  But if you want to have a subreddit made for gay people to discuss the interests of gay people, don't get defensive when people with ""gay"" interests decide to join the discussion as well.

TL;DR: /r/gaybros is big enough for everybody, ""masculine"" or otherwise. There is enough room for some respect, too.

Edit: You're right. It was ""faggot"" not ""fucking faggot,"" although ""fucking"" was in the sentence. I don't feel any meaning has been lost here."
