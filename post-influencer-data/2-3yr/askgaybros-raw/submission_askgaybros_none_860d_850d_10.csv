Good to see the French weren't dumb enough to fall for the email shit."
1,"My father disowned me after I came out BUT..


I am financially independent and too bad he has already fully paid for all my very expensive elite education and unpaid internships etc, so I am now free of chains, debt-free and with a very good job in a nice city. 
Now I can enjoy being myself and I have bargaining power with him, he is the one to need me, not the contrary. 
Get a good degree, move to a good city, and then feel free to be yourself. You might miss 5 years of fully open gayness, but you might get a radically better life in return. 

JUST WAIT TO COME OUT
UNTIL YOU DON'T NEED YOUR PARENTS' SUPPORT !!!!
DON'T RUIN YOUR LIFE
DON'T BE A FUCKING IDIOT 

I hope this can be useful for some younger bros that feel that their homophobic parents will immediately convert to nice liberals. They probably won't, but you can still get something from them, that can help you build a life without them, so wait and SHUT UP. 


Edit: this whole thing is more controversial than I expected, let's clarify a couple of things:
1) I am not shaming those that come out, the fault is still on their parents for not accepting them, I am giving a practical advice that served me well because I saw many different paths ending up very badly. I am not using politically correct jargon because I would like this message stick in some teenagers mind. I was a teenager not long ago, I know how many unreasonable decisions you can take out of false hope and illusion. 
2) if you have accepting parents that's obviously not your situation
3) My opinion is that you should not play with your life just to have the highest moral ground being completely sincere. If you want to be a 'martyr' than it's your choice, but I guess teenagers should think about what's best for their actual future. You have a whole life to be yourself. 
4) I think parents in the long run will be happy that you managed to have your education, you just prevent them from ruining your life in a way that they themselves would regret. In my case I know my father, I know that with a lot of time he will be able to process this, I just didn't want that time to be fatal for my ambitions, that would have made forgiveness much harder"
2,"I came out to my Asian parents last week and it went horrible


And I mean... really horrible. I had my parents sit down with me at the dinner table to have a serious talk. But before I could even open my mouth, my dad blurted out in his language ""Let me guess, you're gay? GTFO of my house, faggot. You're a disgrace to the family"".

He pushed me out of the house and locked the doors. I couldn't believe he would do something like that. I was in disbelief. And if it already doesn't sound bad, it was raining hard that day, too. I was soaking wet as I walked to a nearby park by myself to take cover. I slept on a bench overnight. It was lonely... and the one thing I needed was a hug. Nothing else mattered in my life at that point."
3,"He likes me too!


Today was one of the best days of my life!

So there's this guy I've liked for awhile, but I assumed he was straight. He's the quarterback of our school's football team (cliche, I know) and he's also very good looking and buff. Just like all the standard straight guy stereotypes.

But weirdly enough, we had become friends after we discovered we lived near each other and he would give me a ride home. (I had recently moved because my parents divorced, blah blah, long story, living with just my dad now.) And eventually we started hanging out a lot and going up to the city together and just horsing around like bros do.

But lo and behold, my feelings got the better of me and I felt myself falling for him.

Well last night at a party (that someone weirdly threw on a Wednesday night) we were there together. We got pretty drunk and just sorta hung out on the couch, just talking and like leaning on each other. We just stayed there for a long while and everyone had mostly left (except the hostess and a few of her friends but they were in the hot tub).

THEN, all of a sudden, he looked over at me really earnestly. And in this weird tone of voice he hoarsely whispered: ""lonelyafblonde, how would you feel about being kissed right now?"" And I felt kinda awkward but so excited and I was like, ""Uh, by whom?"" And he was like, ""Me."" So I was like, ""Yeah, yeah, I'd be down.""

SO WE KISSED.

It was amazing and magical and everything I could've hoped for. Like electricity and ASMR and orgasm and a really nice high all at once. So good.

After that, we just talked and made out and talked and made out. We're not sure how quickly we'll move forward or whether or not we'll come out or whatever but I'm so happy. It was the best night of my life. He was at practice all day today so we couldn't hang out or talk, but he just texted me some hearts and kisses emojis, and I'm just glowing and flying!

Just had to share this with you guys lest I explode!"

5,"He loves me.


While we sat together in our usual spot he kept looking at me nervously. We were talking about the usual nonsense but it didn't feel as relaxed as it usually did. He became silent and it looked as if he was about to cry. I asked him if something was wrong and he began to weep. I didn't know what to do so I hugged him and told him he could tell me and I'd try to help him. 

Then those three words came out of his mouth that broke my heart: ""I love you"". He had been wanting to tell me this for years but had never been able to. He has been through so much: depression, abuse, homophobia and loss. Our friendship had always felt quite different. It was never just friendly, it was always something more. And now I realised that we had both been lovers even if we hadn't realised it. 

I took his face in my hands and kissed him. 

Today we started our life together as a couple. He still has a lot of issues, he still has to fully accept himself for who he is but he will get there if I am there for him. 

I love him. He is my love."
6,"Gay Europeans,have you ever had problems with Muslims ? Is the media exaggerating?


Islamic homophobia from immigrants or their descendants became a hot topic here lately. I want to hear your experiences if any?
I am also going to share my point of view. I'm Canadian. I haven't had any physical confrontations with anyone concerning my sexuality since coming out ,Muslims and non Muslims alike. I am not denying homophobia still exists here,but at least it isn't openly encouraged.

 The most ""open"" homophobia I have seen from Muslims is in my college's anonymous confessions page. This gay guy from a muslim family posted that he is struggling with his identity. Then this Muslim commented that ""homosexuality is not promoted"" in Islam and he needs to get rid of his sin. The commenter got bombarded with angry comments from my fellow students saying he can't expect society to eradicate anti Muslim hate if he wasn't willing to let go of his anti gay bigotry and ""If you don't like it,fuck off from our country"". I was never this proud of my University and my peers, we haven't been brainwashed by SJW bullshit yet despite being a major University with liberal leanings."
7,"I am HIV positive - ask me anything


I have been subscribed to this sub for quite some time now and I have seen a lot of comments from people who don't know much about HIV. In an effort to help erase the stigma surrounding the virus in the gay community, I figured I'd step up and answer any questions you may have. Hopefully I can help sway your opinions on HIV and the people who live with it every day (remember, we are still human like the rest of you).

So, /r/AskGayBros, **ASK ME ANYTHING**.

**EDIT** - It's now midnight and I am going to sleep, I'll answer any outstanding questions in the morning. Thanks for all the questions so far guys! :)

**EDIT** - Awake! Going to spend some time answering your questions now."
8,"My 14 son just told us he's gay


On one hand, this wasn't a huge surprise to me as I've seen signs that I thought might indicate as much. For my wife and I, we let him know how much we love him and it changes nothing about how we think of him. He is a great kid but is sensitive and worries about other's feelings over his own. He has 3 older sisters who are all very open minded and we've encouraged him to share with him so they can support him too. 

The biggest thing I told him was this is part of your identity and not to put too much stock in anyone who can't accept that. Essentially, I know he will face certain crap from ignorant people and I don't want him to live in fear of those kinds of people.

My big question is this: he's technically my stepson (we don't really use that label as I've been in his life since he was 3), and his dad and stepmom who he lives with half time are way more conservative than we are. I'm hopeful they will surprise him/us with acceptance but my fear is they will try and make him feel wrong in his feelings. I encouraged him to have a conversation with them and tried to prepare him for that possibility.

But what else can we tell him and how else can we support him?

EDIT: You guys are an amazing community and I'm so glad I posted! Tons of good advice and it keeps coming in. Thank you so much to everyone who has made positive comments, like most parenting stuff, we're doing our best and trying not to screw up too bad before they're adults."
9,"17-Year-Old Gay Teen Pushed Off 9th Floor Balcony By Uncle After He Was Outed By Chechen Family

&gt;The Prophet, Allah's blessings be upon him, cursed effeminate men (those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, ""Turn them out of your houses ."" The Prophet (ﷺ) turned out such-and-such man, and `Umar turned out such-and-such woman.

10,"Went out a walk with a guy and it went well.


I recently posted about finding it hard after being abused by my ex to trust someone. I asked if I should start dating this guy. Well this morning he surprised me as he was waiting for me after class to go a walk and get some lunch. We chatted about dorky things and politics (we are both studying politics) and we had a great time. He is really cute and lovely but also dorky like me. 

Our politics differ but of course that just makes it more fun when we have nothing to do we can argue about politics. 

Thanks for the advice. I will be going to a counselling session on Thursday for the first time and I hope to beat my own fears.
