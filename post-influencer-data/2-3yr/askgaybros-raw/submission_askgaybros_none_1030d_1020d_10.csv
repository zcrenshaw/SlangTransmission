0,"My partner of 5 years just passed unexpectedly.


Yesterday, I lost my best friend, my partner, my everything. We have only known each other for 5 years, but it felt like a lifetime.

Yeah, we've had our ups and downs, but we stuck next to each other through thick and thin. We had planned to travel the world and experience new things together.

When I took you to the hospital, it was only for flu like symptoms. You were suppose to come home on Sunday.

I miss you so much!

You were getting better, I didn't think this would ever happen. I was by your side the entire time! I spoke to you. I promised to you that all will be okay.

I failed you.

You truly were my better half, and today, I lost you, and now I'm no longer whole.

You are loved and missed by many friends and family, but most of all, by me.

Joshua, I will always love, cherish, and think of you.

I love you forever.

-Michael

1,"UPDATE: Outed myself and got kicked out. Any advice?


[deleted]"
2,"I came out to my older brother


Dunno why I'm posting this, but I figured I would tell you guys as it might help someone on anything.   
So yesterday my family saw me after I came a bit late to home. I had hickies all over my neck (They feel great at first and full of regret later on). My mother saw them and acted like it was nothing, but was honestly shocked, but my brother was intrigued.   
I'm not known to have sex a lot or go out with anyone or showing any interest in women.  He assumed that it was the doing of a girl and persisted into knowing how I got to know this girl.   
After he noticed how avoidant I was about the subject ( guys usually tell those things naturally) and how I generally not interested in women. He said I know what you have and I would honestly not expect that thing from you, but if it's true, then I will support you 100% . You are my closest brother and my friend, and whatever you say to me will be a secret between us.   
So in that moment I decided to come out to him and he was nothing but supportive. He even asked what type of guys I like and such.   
I decided to come out to him because no harm could happen to me, and I advice anyone who would to prioritize their safety of course. "
3,"/r/AskGayBros Guide to 'Should I Come Out?'


This question gets asked all the time, so here is the consensus:

If you are not financially independent, *do* ***not*** *come out*.

Here it is in chart form:
http://imgur.com/a/Qs4tV

* Your **Safety** is our number one priority.

Some possible results:

* If you are not financially independent, living at home, and get kicked out you will be homeless.

* If you are not financially independent, not living at home, and your family cuts off financial support you will be homeless.

* If you are not financially independent, are going to college or university , and your family cuts off financial support you may not be able to continue your degree. This will make it more difficult to become financially independent.

Staying in the closet sucks. Yes it sucks to lie to your family every day. Yes it sucks to be 'living a lie'. You will likely be a good liar once you're financially independent. This is for your own safety. Your safety is our number one priority.

Maybe your family is different. You may be one of the lucky ones who has parents who truly love and support their children no matter what. Do not bank on this; the majority of your life is what we are discussing with this question. If they love and accept you once you're financially independent then that is great.

These people were temporarily homeless, or still are. These people suddenly had to figure out where they were going to live and how they were going to pay for food, water, and electricity. /r/AskGayBros will always be a place where you can come and ask for advice, resources, and help; that being said we would prefer you never need to ask.

This post is not meant to make you fearful or anxious about coming out. Your coming out experience will vary based on the prevailing culture and laws for your region. This is a recommendation to make sure you can support yourself, or have a plan towards doing so, should the worst happen. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. 

I may be convinced to write up a more complete guide and reasons why this is the usual answer from here. Maybe I'm not the right person to write this, but something along these lines should be stickied or in the sidebar. "
4,"UPDATE: My BF Lied to Me About His Age: He's a Minor. I'm 27


Ok. We finally had a good long conversation about this. And things are much clearer know about his parents and how he got here. He will hopefully find a job soon because there is lady that I often meet at the park who needed a dog sitter but I'm helping him apply for other jobs as well. I also had a long conversation with my mom who after everything I told her said: ""A high school diploma at 16? Your boy's got beauty and brains"". Anyway, she and my stepdad will be sending me monthly money for him so he at least has some sort of income to be able to do more when I'm at work. Also, his parents couldn't afford college anyway so my parents offered to help me get him into college because I know that that's what he really wants. And then there is also finding theraphy because apparently he spent two weeks on the streets and his parents are worse than I thought. So, at least he will be kept busy during the week. Also the dog is sleeping with him on the couch and really likes him. I told him that I loved him I guess and asked him if he wanted to continue with ""us"" and explained to him that nothing would change and I'd still be there for him if he said no. He said yes. I just don't want him to think that people will only help you if you offer them sex and obv meant what I said.

The bad news is I called some juvenile law firms up. They told me that he isn't allowed to live with me legally because he is a runaway. His parents haven't filed a missing report but the person I spoke to said if they do so before he turns 18 I might be getting in trouble. To avoid this we have to get legal permission from his parents allowing him to live with me. This seems highly unlikely because they are homophobic and them signing a contract allowing allowing their 17 y/o to live with a grown gay men is probs equivalent to signing a deal with the devil. Or else we have to get emancipation which  is hard and is barely done. Also his mom texted him and asked him to go home for thanksgiving. He didn't reply yet. Right know we are still waiting for the attorney to get back to me and still not sure about what his parents can and will do."
5,"Boyfriend Lied to Me About His Age: He's a Minor (I'm 27).


He is 17 but for the past five months I thought that he was 22 because he told me so. He looks like he is 22 and acts mature. He makes dinner when I get from work, cleans the house, we have deep conversations. I discovered that he is 17 after we got pulled over on the road, he made a whole effort of getting out the car but when he got back in, his license fell out of his pocket. When we got back to my place, we had a huge fight. I told him that I don't want to have sex with him, don't want him to message me and that he should leave my house. He started crying and said that his parents had kicked him out because he is gay and that he is not safe with them. When I asked him why he just didn't tell me, he couldn't answer. I don't know what to do know. Don't know if he liked me in the first place or just needed shelter. I just feel like a massive creep for sleeping with him and kissing him. Right know I told him to sleep on the couch. What should I do? I didn't ask to be turned from daddy to dad but don't want to put him in danger either.

***EDIT: I'm sorry but I can't answer ever single reply but I do appreciate it. We talked but not much, I asked where he is from and about his parents. He is from a small town in Pennsylvania, which I've never heard of but the internet tells me it exists. About his parents, ""they're racist, homophobic redneck trump supporters"".These are his words. I'm not going to post the whole story of how the hell he got in Boston in the first place, but I'm the only person he knows. 

I have to work tomorrow but guess I have to stay and figure this out. I can barely sleep knowing he is lying there on the couch. Just knowing his age, regardless of he age of consent makes me uncomfortable. My stephbrother is his age and I never planned on dating somone 10 years younger. Also I'm his first, not many 17 y/o want to settle so this looks like it won't end well.

My worries are his well being and at the moment I don't know if I can give him the support he needs. Also I had a crazy ex boyfriend in the past who tried to blackmail me. He was so obsessed with my dog and demanded custody as if we had birthed it together. It ended with my dog biting him and hin leaving.

Of course I won't kick him out but he is afraid to go back to his hometown due to stuff his parents said and right know I don't feel comfortable acting all coupley. Especially knowing his parents are from Philly and the consent rules they have there."
6,"I'm being accused of being a HOMOPHOBE...That stupid...Right?


**A close girl friend of mine has a gay bestfriend, his name is Andy.** We've all known each other since high school but Andy and I, just never....clicked. No hate or issues between us, we just dont hang out like that. 
-

**First lemme say, Andy is very smart, has style for days &amp; is VERY goodlooking** *(he has Blues eyes you just get lost in).* BUT If I'm being honest...Andy is obnoxious *as fuck.* He has a constant need to be the center of attention. He says the most offensive things to people! **And NO ONE is off limits for his harsh remarks.** I think... he thinks, he's funny or something but he's not. He's just rude and even a bully half the time. **He thinks its funny to mock overweight &amp; ""ugly"" people. He even tries to out people he thinks is gay** And I've always been very clear when I'm not cool with his shit. I roll my eyes at him or flat out tell him to chill when he crosses the line but he'll just smile and say ""whaaat?"". He even started calling me ""St. Mary"" b/c of these exchanges. He literally leaves me FB &amp; IG comments calling me St. Mary.

_

**Last Saturday, shit hit the fan.**
-
 Our mutual friend had a mixer at her house and, of course, Andy was there. **I came with my boyfriend, who is half Korean.** Andy hadnt met him before and as we all sit down Andy says something to the effect of: *""Damn girl, all this time I was feelin' bad for you. I mean, you know what they say about Asians. But he's GORGEOUS, I see why you taking that little sausage.""*

**Well...That was the last straw. I went OFF.** I told him a few things about himself. Then told our friend not to bring his disrespectful ass around me anymore. Thats when Andy chimed in, claiming I've NEVER liked him... **because he is gay.**  To which I said ""Boy, BYE! Get out of my face with that BS."" 

_

**Andy started screaming/crying** about how I've always looked down on him for being gay. That I think I'm better than him.... Even said I judge him for using Grindr. *(I think he's referring to when I urged him to stop having unprotected sex with those strangers. I even sat him down and read him HIV stats. And I was very clear it was out of genuine concern.)*  **That night, Andy makes an IG post.** Saying *""You'll never be good enough for some people. But just remember you're beautiful the way you are....Flaws &amp; All""* I commented: *""unless you're fat or have bad skin, right?""* He deleted my comment Hahaha xD. IDK if he's trying to say being mean goes hand in hand with being gay but I'm not buying it.... BUT I guess because his parents dis-owned him when he came out. **My friends are pressing me to Apologize.**

_

**TL;DR:** 
-
Bottomline, I don't give a shit who ANYONE is fucking or dating. **If you're an asshole....you're an asshole.** Personally, I think he's full of shit. He's been saying AND doing fucked up shit the WHOLE 8years I've known him. *As soon as I call him on his shit...the throws a tantrum.* I really dont feel bad....BUT my girl friend keeps begging me to apologize... **WHY TF DO I NEED TO APOLOGIZE?**

**EDIT:** Yeah, I realize left quite a bit out.... We grew up in Palos Verdes, CA. Its a pretty affluent neighborhood and when he came out Senior year he had to stay at his aunts house in Pasadena, CA the rest of the year. Its been 5 years and his parents still wont really acknowledge him. I mean, his siblings still adore him but...His parents are the elitist types, you know? Like they have real strict views on whats good enough for their family. They're also kind of racist, their oldest son, Declan, brought home a black girl once and they cut him off financially until he broke up with her. **Admittedly Andy has been through A LOT.** His parents are shitty, he's in debt up to his eyeballs b/c his parent refused to pay for college... and he's made a decent career for himself as a stylists ALL ON HIS OWN. **I dont know what to say about our circle of friends.** They party and go to events together....Thats just not my thing. I travel and I'm a writer. They spend WAY more time with him than I do..."
7,"My brother revealed he is a white supremacist after the election and it's tearing our family apart.


We still talk, but there is a rift in our relationship that I don't think will ever mend. The kicker: I am half filipino and we have different fathers (he is white). He is still friendly with me and we've had long heated conversations about race relations and politics in the past, but this goes so far beyond getting a little upset about health care policy. The only reason he still speaks with me is because ""I'm not a nigger"" because ""Asians are genetically superior to blacks and I'm still half white.""  
  
I am at the point where I want to cut off all contact. This is...frightening. Our parents aren't aware of his beliefs, and I'm not sure if he'll bring them up with them. He supports the alt-right, has told me he's considering participating in the KKK, and he believes in a separation of races. He also came out to me as a redpiller and said some terrible things about his wife and daughter...  
  
It seems like an easy decision: cut ties with him. But a part of me still feels guilty. The fact we've known each other for the 20ish years of our lives makes things complicated. But his presence (literally) makes me sick to my stomach.  
  
Edit: title says tearing our family apart, but I guess I just mean our relationship. If this was known by more of our family I think it would be even worse of a shitshow. Especially since my father (a lawyer) has sacrificed much for him. Paid entirely for his college education, been a second father to him because his dad was never around, etc.  
  
He sends me links from various websites and I almost feel like it's similar to Muslim radicalization propaganda/brainwashing. I don't know who my brother is anymore."
8,"I’m 35, Gay and Terrified I’ll Be Single Forever.


Honestly, I can’t believe I’m sharing this with you – let alone typing it on my desktop. There’s no easy way to do this I guess but just blurt it out.

I’m a 35-year old gay man who is terrified of being single forever.
That may seem like a silly thing to say. But reading it on my desktop now makes it even more real. Honest to God, with each passing day, it feels like my worst fears are coming true.

I guess what sparked my anxiety is a recent comment a friend from yester-year made to me when we ran into each other at a bar. “I can’t believe you’re still single!”

Has anyone ever told you that? Did it make you feel like crap? I’m sure there was no malice intended behind those words but they cut like a knife just the same. My mind translates it into: Why haven’t you got your s*hit together yet?

The older I get, the more alone I feel. Whenever I look around, another one of my friends is getting married. And if they aren’t getting hitched, they are at least involved with someone.

Some are gay and some are straight but all of them have somebody.

All of them – except for me.

Please don’t think I’m whining. I kinda love my life. And it’s not like I don’t put myself out there. I totally do!

I’m on OK Cupid, Match, Hornet and even a few of the hook up apps for good measure. I go to gay related charity events and am no stranger to the bars.

But it just seems like each time I start seeing a guy, it goes nowhere. Oh sure, we might go out on a few dates and have some laughs. But after a while, things fizzle out.

A lot of the guys I meet are just flakes – looking for “someone better” I guess. It sucks because I’m one of those gays who truly wants to be in a relationship and build something special, like a family, you know?

I don’t think I’m ugly either. I'm not the white ripped man stereotype,  I may not turn everyone’s head when I walk into a room but I’m not hideous. Just an average looking gay man who tries to take care of himself. I don't go to the gym but I eat well. My weight is normal 80 kg - (183 cm height).

Is it just me or does it seem like once you get into your middle 30’s, the pressure to couple up starts mounting. Kind of like a ticking alarm clock that you know will eventually go off and scream: Times up!

I guess my biggest fear now is that nobody is going to want to date an aging gay who has little history of “being” with someone.

You want honesty right. I’m giving it to you.

I’m also tired of hooking up with men who are sexual robots; men who wouldn’t know real passion if it hit them on the head. I want a man who wants love. A man who can be vulnerable. Someone who wants to love back.

Maybe it’s me. Perhaps my expectations are just messed up. All I require is authenticity and a desire to let someone in. That’s what I try to do when I’ve met other men.

But it’s not turning out that way.

All I keep finding are guys who are looking for “the one”. They have it in their mind that it’s got to be a “match” on the first date – period.

Doesn’t it take more than just one cup of coffee or one meal to get to know somebody?

In a few weeks it will be my 36th birthday. In gaydom, that doesn’t make me “ancient” but I am creeping towards “older”. What’s sick about it is that in the straight world, 36 is considered young.

WTF am I going to do if I’m still single at 40? Will other gay men think I’m toxic because I’m still “available”? Deep inside, I kind bet that’s exactly what they’ll think. I feel deep inside there is something wrong with me, like I'm broken or damaged somehow.
I'm doing well at work but I don't get the point? 
All my life has been about fighting for my right to be myself defending myself against my homophobic parents and relatives. At this point of my life I thought things would be better.

I mean, what is the point of working and fighting so hard if at the end of the day there's no one to share those victories with?
I really don't get it,  everyone around me have someone, I know all type of men: slim, fat, muscular, 'straight acting', 'effeminate', black, white, in monogamous and open relationships. All of them have someone. Of course, not every relationship is real or perfect but at least they're trying. That is better than nothing.

I often get compliments from people at work, they like my clothes and perfumes, I'm a introvert, don't like to be the center of attention. People who know me thing that I am educated and smart because I was a really good student.
I read a lot and do my best to dress according the situation.
Gosh, I even speak 3 languages. I read about technology, politics, science. I swear I've done my best to be my best self (not there yet) but I try not to be a jerk, BUT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING'S ENOUGH.

Perhaps the error has been reading too much instead of hitting the gym.

Sorry, I'm just trying to find out what's wrong with me before is later...."
