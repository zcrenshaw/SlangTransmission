0,"How do I tell my dad I know he's gay (update)


Here's my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/65gpcp/how_do_i_tell_my_dad_i_know_hes_gay/

Anyways, I decided to talk to my dad after we had lunch Sunday when he was in a good mood. First we started talking about mom, how she would feel about things now, and about the past. Then I started mentioning how I wanted him to be happy no matter what. He was kind of confused about where I was going with the conversation but he went along with it.

Then I mentioned his assistant. I could tell that made him really uncomfortable and he started saying that he was trying to be a friend to him since he had had a bad home life or something. I could see that he was deflecting so I dropped the conversation for a while. We didn't really talk for about an hour, the whole time we just awkwardly watched tv. Finally, I brought up the night I saw them on the couch together. Immediately, he started saying they were just tired and that he must have been doing everything in his sleep. He saw I wasn't falling for it.

Then he started tearing up. I've never actually seen my dad seriously cry before so I knew there was something going on. He started saying that he didn't want to be a disappointment to me,how he didn't want me to think he was a bad person and all (which is obviously wrong, I love him to death). I hugged him and told I would never think that. 

He pretty much completely opened up after I made it clear he could be honest with me. He told me he had struggled with himself his entire life. He said he had been hurt in high school when he fell in love with a friend, how he didn't want to be a ""pervert"" (a different time I guess?). He married my mom thinking it would make him ""normal"", how happy he was when I was born because he thought he could live a ""normal"" life. Of course it really hurt me that he felt that things had to be like that.

He went on about how he took painkillers because they made him just ignore his feelings. He said that while he loved my mom, after I was born they never did anything again. She knew about him but they stayed together because they just really enjoyed each other (which is true, they never argued, they were never cold to each other, and it devastated him when she died). Then he admitted he was finally, truly in love for once with someone now. I told him that was okay, there was nothing wrong with it. We went on and on like this for god knows how many hours. 

Finally, he actually called up his assistant and told him I knew about them. He had actually been trying to tell my dad to tell me about their relationship for a long time. I told dad he didn't have to keep secrets like this. Whatever made him happy would make me happy. It was like a weight lifted off of him when I said that. He got excited like a kid describing their relationship (his assistant got him to quit smoking which is pretty impressive since he's tried every treatment ever, encouraged him to go back to school, helped him with exercising and dieting since he's kind of pudgy, etc.).

I'm glad I did this because now dad seems so much better. I feel like we've gotten closer since  that there's not a giant gulf between us about his feelings. I don't know if he'll come out to the rest of the family (let's just say they're not very open-minded), but I'm hoping now things will be easier for him. Thanks for reading and the support guys, I've really appreciated it.

Edit: wow, I never expected gold from this. I just hope this post has helped any of you guys (whatever your age or circumstances) out there who feel like they have no options or are totally alone. There are people out there who care, there are people who want you to be happy. Just hang in there. Once again, thanks guys!"
1,"Life works out


Was in love with my best friend in the 70s. Felt he had feelings too but never did anything. I hated who I was and did all the manly things to be straight. Sports cars etc. I overcame it in college and met my soulmate. We were together 30 years. I lost him in a car accident and was devastated. 
My friend married in college. We grew apart but he knew I was gay by my early 20s. Didn't seem to bother him despite his Mormon upbringing. 

His wife died last year of ovarian cancer and he was devastated. Saw him around town from time to time and we'd talk briefly. 2 weeks ago talked and was having a rough time. I recommended a grief counseling group I'd been to. 
He called me last week and thanked me. Then asked if I'd have breakfast. 

Subject came up as to how I met Ken, then he asked me when I realized I was gay. I blurted out when I met you. His head dropped and I felt terrible. I apologized and he looked up. He had wet eyes. Smiled and said ""we fucked that up""

I was shocked and confused. We left soon after not speaking. In the parking lot he took my hand leaned over and lightly kissed my lips. ""We should see if we can fix that""

We went on a date Saturday. It was incredible. We ended with a long passionate kiss. Haven't felt this good since Ken passed. Seeing him tonight and we have talked and texted for hours every day. I'm like a teen again. We are going slow, I've never slept with anyone but Ken, and he with only Diane. Needless to say we are both a little jittery. 
Just wanted to share!"

3,"How do I tell my dad I know he's gay?


I don't know what to do about this. My dad (52) is a great guy and I what him to know I support him but he's gone to pretty great lengths to hide his sexuality from me so it's pretty easy to tell that he's insecure about himself. On the one hand he's a very conservative, devout Catholic (voted for Trump and thinks that Pope Francis is too progressive) but on the other hand he's mostly open-minded about people and he's never been homophobic in any way (he once met one of my gay friends who's very open and was very respectful albeit a little hesitant around him). 

I know he's gay because after my mom died he's never dated for my entire childhood they had separate bedrooms (he claimed he didn't want to disturb her because he's an insomniac). The real kicker, though, is his ""assistant"". My dad has a construction company and works with a lot of Hispanics but spends most of his time with a young guy who's pretty much my age (he's 24). They go to dinner every night, he comes to our house several times a week and spends the night (because they're working on ""projects). One night around 3am, I went down to the basement where we have an entertainment room and saw them on the couch snuggled together with my dad rubbing his leg. 

I love my dad and want him to be happy. I would hate it if his sexuality is making him miserable because he's always been my role model throughout life. I know that he's kept secrets from me before and he's been very good at it (apparently he was addicted to painkillers pretty much my entire life up until I went to college... I never knew the entire time). With this it just hurts me any time I see him trying to cover up his feelings so how I can I go about talking to him about this?

Edit: Thanks for all of the replies guys! As I wrote below, I'm going to try to talk to dad Sunday since neither of us work. Wish me luck and I'll try to write a follow-up if anything happens."

http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/15/ireland-just-became-the-first-country-to-introduce-a-national-lgbt-youth-strategy/

IRELAND IS TO  become the first country in the world to carry out a national LGBT youth strategy.
The strategy aims to address the challenges faced by young members of Ireland’s LGBT community.
Young people around Ireland are being urged to get involved and share their views over the coming months, with events organised around the country.


Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone is today launching the online questionnaire for the strategy at Facebook headquarters in Dublin.


While consultations are taking place online, a meeting for all young people who want to get involved will take place in Dublin on 6 May.


Young members of the LGBT community are encouraged to attend roadshows in Sligo, Dundalk, Waterford, Galway and Cork in the coming months.


The programme plans to consult young people between the age of 15-24 about all aspects of their lives so as to provide key recommendations in certain policy areas.


“Today we invite young people across Ireland to be part of history. Through Facebook Live and an online consultation with Spunout.ie they will help form the world’s first LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy,” said the minister.

I look forward to hearing the views of young people. Their input in the coming months will directly impact our policies, regulations and laws in terms of equality, fairness and justice for all."

6,"[UPDATE]: A Hook-Up That Won't Leave?


EDIT 2: [Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/672xxo/final_update_a_hookup_that_wont_leave/?st=J1UVLYHO&amp;sh=99221a1f)

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/65famx/a_hookup_that_wont_leave/?st=J1J78MYQ&amp;sh=0b06feb8)


Alright so a few people wanted me to let them know what ended up happening with my Grindr hookup or whatever he is. There was more interest in this situation than I was expecting so I'm still trying to reply to comments and stuff. But anyway, I think at this point it probably makes more sense to just go ahead and post an update so here goes. 

Last night he texted me around 9:00ish saying he was sorry but that he'd ""accidentally"" left a few things at my place because he overslept and had to rush out to work. I said it was fine and he asked if he could come get it in a couple hours. I said yeah and then he said he could bring food if I wanted it. I didn't know what he was planning on getting if he was coming that late but I said he could try if anything was open.

He ended up getting to my apartment a little before midnight and somehow  managed to find both pizza and vodka, so I was fairly impressed. 

After we ate the pizza I made us drinks and we pretty much just hung out watching tv. Eventually I managed to gather my liquid courage to have a talk with him. 

I basically just said that I'd never had a Grindr hookup that lasted this long. 
(In reality, I have 0 Grinder hookups to compare with this one but he doesn't need to know that lol). He just laughed though and said he's never had one last this long either. 

So then I was like ""yeah, I mean, I just realized you've come over every night since Tuesday, which is okay, but I was thinking this was gonna be a one and done situation based on what you said you wanted initially."" 

Now I really tried to phrase that well so he didn't get the wrong impression but after I said that he got super quiet. So that made me think I probably just screwed up whatever it is we've been doing for the past week. 

So when he didn't respond I was just like ""it's alright though, I get it."" (In reality, I didn't get it at all and don't even know what I meant by that. I just didn't know what else to say honestly). 

So then he asked if he could share something with me. I said okay, but at this point I'm panicking a bit bc so many people commented under my last post saying he might be homeless 😩

But he ended up telling me he just went through a bad breakup with a guy he was with for 4 years and he just ""wasn't looking to jump into anything new."" He didn't give much detail about what happened, but he said he's ""really used to being in a relationship"" and ""it's just hard to get used to sleeping alone."" But then he was like ""that's not really your problem though, so I'm sorry if I've invaded your space."" 

So at that point I felt so bad I almost cried. He sounded so sad and almost embarrassed which obviously wasn't my intention at all in bringing this up. So I just said ""no it's okay, I was just surprised by it, that's all"" and then I told him I'd actually like to see where he lives and maybe get to know him better. 

I guess that was the right thing to say bc he kinda brightened up then and told me, if I wanted, I could come over his place and he'd try to cook something. I said that would be nice and tried not to show how relieved I was that he finally asked. 

Anyway, he ended up saying I can come by tomorrow night bc that'll give him time to clean up and buy food or whatever he's gonna do. 

Sooo that's the plan for right now. 

Honestly even though this is pretty much exactly what I wanted/asked for, for some reason I'm super nervous. I guess it's kind of dumb to be scared  because we've already been having sex but this just seems like a bigger step, maybe? 

Then again he still hasn't really said how he feels about me or anything like that, and he didn't actually call this a date, so we'll see :p

Anyway, feel free to still leave comments and tips or whatever. I'm hoping things go smoothly and that I can keep my natural awkwardness in check, so pray for me on that lol.  

TLDR; Our talk was (kinda) successful and I'm FINALLY gonna see his place tomorrow 😳😳😳"
7,"Rape fantasy : update


I did it. I didn't die. I enjoyed it and had fun. Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6686s9/rape_fantasy/

Per the advice of the sub, I wanted to get to know the guy a little better. It wasn't enough in general but I talked to him for about 45 minutes over two phone calls and texted more, for a few days. Not good enough I know. *It's incredibly important that you know and trust each other otherwise major problems will happen.*

I let him know I was apprehensive and he was willing to back down the scene or totally do something else if I wanted to. I still wanted to participate in the scene, so he just made it clear that at any point, the safe word would be stop it all. 

I parked down the street and walked up to his place. He was sitting on the stoop outside his house so I walked up. I introduced myself and told him I was the guy interested in buying his TV. We kept this dialog going, but before we walked inside he paused and asked, ""are you sure about this."" I nodded and said yes. 

He motioned towards the bedroom so I walked up the stairs with him bringing up the rear. I walked in and walked over to the TV, started asking typical questions (how long have you had it, etc). 

Almost immediately he came up behind me, hand over my mouth. He held a knife to my throat and growled at me not to make a noise. He ran the knife up and down my throat, and used his free hand to loosen my pants. They dropped to my ankles and he dropped his pants in turn. 

He lowered the knife, so I made a break for it. I made it one step before he'd grabbed me by the shoulder and tossed me on the bed. He was on me in a flash, I was facing him now. Knife against my throat, he told me not to do that again, he looked pissed. 

He grabbed my skull and shove his cock in my mouth. He was uncircumcised and slightly bigger than average. He immediately got it in my throat and started ramming my face. I was starting to whimper by this point. He was calling me trash, whore, slut, etc. He was barely letting me breath, I was starting to get low on breath. 

He pulled his cock out of my throat and flipped me around so I was doggy position on the bed. He had lube somehow and shoved his cock in immediately. I cried out in shock, so he pushed me down flat on the bed and shoved my underpants in my mouth. He told me not to spit it out, or he'd hurt me. (hint I could spit it out and say the safe word easily) . 

I bit both lips because of how rough he was. I was moaning and begging him to stop which pushed him harder. I was trying to get out from under him, but he was way too big for me. As I squirmed under him he grabbed my hands and wrenched them behind my back. He'd gotten handcuffs from somewhere and slapped them on really really right. It hurt a lot, especially with his weight on me. 

I was now gagged, cuffed, and bent over his bed as he railed me. He was calling me garbage still, commenting on how hard I was and how much I wanted it. This went on for a couple minutes with him fucking harder and faster and pushing my face further into the bed. 

He came and groaned loudly, still slapping hard against my ass. He slowly pulled out and walked to the bathroom to wash his hands. 

After a minute, he took the underpants out of my mouth, unhandcuffed me, and pulled me close next to him with my head on his chest. He asked some questions and told me how I was such a good boy and did very well. He caressed me and was very sweet, and I fell asleep on him. 

We hung out for another two hours and then split. We'll meet again soon.

Edit: I've been hearing comments and pms of people saying I should remove this because it promotes bad behaviors. I disagree, because while I screwed up badly, I think it's more valuable to share my fuck up and discuss it. "
8,"Have you ever started crying when holding your boyfriend's hand?


I was with my boyfriend this weekend on a two-hour train journey and he started holding my hand under his coat while we watched a movie. We also rested our heads against each other.

However, whenever the train door would slide open or if someone would get up from their seat etc, I would sit up straight, without resting my head against his, and I would get very nervous.

I almost felt like a criminal ... For holding my boyfriend's hand.

And it just got to me how messed up that is. I shouldn't feel like a criminal. It's a completely normal thing. If we were a straight couple, there would be no need to hide it.

It just really hit me how broken society is, and I began to think about all the homophobic sh*t my family put me through. And my eyes began to fill with tears.

Has this ever happened to you?"

This morning I woke my husband up for sex in a subtle way. After sex, he explained what he thought was happening at first.
In his dream he was standing in line at the bank, and suddenly he was like ""why is there a cock in my hand? It's a very nice cock, but still, why is there a cock in my hand?""

What's the funniest or weirdest dream you've had while being woken up for sex?"
