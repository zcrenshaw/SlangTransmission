1,"Hey, can we please stop attacking the guys who post here with loads of internalized homophobia? They need help and support, not to be downvoted to hell and ridiculed.


Thanks 

Edit: many people seem to think I'm talking about masc vs fem drama. I'm not. I'm talking about guys who are actually struggling to accept that being gay is OK. Sure, IH sometimes manifests as overcompensation in gender expression and distaste for fem guys, but that's not the point"
2,"In good news, same-sex marriage has correlated to a drop in the LGBT suicide rate in the US.

When far right conservatives talk about overturning Obergefell, they should have this thrown in their faces. "
3,"France‚Äôs Marine Le Pen quietly pledges to end same-sex marriage.


Front National leader Marine Le Pen is currently leading in first-round polls ahead of France‚Äôs Presidential election.
Le Pen‚Äôs party previously maintained strong ties to the anti-LGBT lobby.

But despite any ‚Äúreforms‚Äù, Le Pen has now quietly confirmed plans to end same-sex marriage in the country, burying the policy announcement in a list of 144 pledges released last week.
Buried midway through the lengthy document at number 87, Le Pen promises to create an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù form of civil unions in the country to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù the equal marriage law passed under the current Socialist government in 2013.

The policy plan specifies that the changes would ‚Äúnot be retroactive‚Äù, sparing Le Pen the legal headache of trying to unpick or downgrade thousands of existing same-sex marriages, but the replacement plan would close same-sex marriage to new couples ‚Äì meaning gays would once again only be able to enter civil partnerships.

As well as plans to tamper with equality laws, Le Pen also outlines plans to restrict fertility services, ending assistance for gay couples wanting to have children.
Ironically, the plans were snuck out under a sub-heading claiming FN would ‚Äúallow everyone to find their place‚Äù in French society.
The policy shift is surprising given the FN‚Äôs recently attempts to court gay voters, playing down reports of homophobia and taking advantage of fears over homophobic Islamic extremists.

she will likely face either centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron or Republicans right-winger Francois Fillon.
Macron, the only supporter of LGBT rights among the top candidates, has faced ‚Äògay‚Äô smears in recent weeks from Russian state media outlets.

Hopefully this disgusting bitch loses. Bigly

5,"Made my boyfriend cum hands free!


Just wanted to share, I've posted here previously about some of my insecurities as a top so I was pleasantly fucking surprised last night when I watched the look on my boyfriend's face as he came just from me fucking him! Felt really good to tick that off my sexual bucket list. 

What are some sexual accomplishments you've achieved recently? "

8,"Getting some karma from the gaybros universe today.


Hopefully. Haha.

I'm just super happy I was able to help out one of my friends/gaybros. We're the same age and went to the same Master's program and he has been struggling for 6 months to find a job in the entertainment industry after his last one (that he hated). He was at the point where he might have had to move back home if he didn't find something soon. I found a solid job at a really great company in the industry 2 1/2 years ago, and it killed me that I couldn't do anything to help him, because to be honest, I would look around at the people I worked with and know that he was smarter/harder-working/more talented than a lot of them.

Anyhoo, my job finally opened a posting that he applied for, and HR normally sends an email out to the company to ask employees whether we know someone who would be good for the job. He actually applied for it and was *rejected* at first, because a lot of his experience was elsewhere. But then they asked me about him and I sold him hardcore to HR and they decided to take his app out of the rejected pile and bring him in for an interview.

They liked him immediately and he was one of the last 3 being considered. Today they're offering him the job! (On another note, it makes me sad how many potential great employees could be left behind just because they don't ""know someone.""). 

Either way, I'm super happy I could do what I could to help him out (and the rest was totally him)...and then I found out that any employee who recommends someone who ends up being hired is also given a bonus! Had no idea, haha. So I'm happy for both of us.

And I've got a gaybro to kick it with at work now. Just wanted to share the story, since my life has been clouded with a lot of shit recently. But this was a good thing.

Happy Tuesday y'all!"
