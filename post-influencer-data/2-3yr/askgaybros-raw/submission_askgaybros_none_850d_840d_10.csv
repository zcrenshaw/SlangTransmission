0,"I accidentally outed my ex to his family


This just happened and I feel like trash. 

I dated this guy for a little bit earlier this year and I just didn't feel the spark so I ended things. I still liked him as a person so we remained friends. He kept asking me to go to his glee concerts and I said I'd go to one. 


I kept putting it off but today he graduated from Norte Dame and this was his last concert, so I went and got a ticket. There must have been two hundred people there so I find my seat and sit down. 


This woman next to me asks why I'm there, I say a friend is preforming. She asked who and how I met him. I said who he was and that we dated a bit. His parents were seated right in front of me. I had no idea. 


During intermission I told them I was pulling a prank on him to get back at him for doing the same thing to me. His mother started crying, hugged me and was thanking god her son isn't gay. I said I had to leave and that I'm sorry, the prank went too far. 


I don't think his father bought it. I text him everything after I left. He luckily read it before he saw them. I have no idea what's going to happen next and I feel horrible. "
1,"My roommate came out to me


He said he's bi and that he's never told anyone.  And his date tonight is actually with a guy.

It's funny, I'm usually the one doing the coming out.  Fucking stoked that he chose to tell me first.

That is all."
2,"Update: My landlord has rented out our spare room to a trio of Italian bodybuilders in town for a competition.


Since many have requested an update on this, I didn't want to disappoint...well, some will be disappointed anyway, as there are no gory details I can share. Nothing relevant really happened, apart from two of them passing in the hallway in their undies on the way to/from the bathroom and one of them using my scale to weigh himself (he was a whopping 260 pounds of muscle). 

They were just nice to me and that's it. Although I have now more respect for bodybuilders, since the level of commitment they put is amazing. They went to the kitchen 5/6 times a day and swallowed massive quantities of food, counting their calories.

For the doubting Thomases around who think I am making up stuff, that's one the pics of the two hot ones (faces covered for obvious protection of their privacy): http://imgur.com/CHzyeUJ

3,"Was sick, got treatment, found out I was gay: My story.


Growing up I knew I was different. I was always super social and loved being around people, but I was hiding something. I had mind-numbing fatigue that never went away. This all started right as I hit puberty. My pediatrician was a joke and took none of my symptoms to heart, so I suffered through it.


So at the end of my sophomore year, almost 7 years after I started feeling my symptoms, I had enough. I went to my student health center and refused to leave until I had some sort of answer. Got a full blood test assay, and I got the answer I was looking for. Low testosterone, incredibly low. I had to get another blood draw a couple weeks later and EVEN LOWER. It was at this point it was IU Health's policy to give me a brain CT followed by an MRI. They found what was up. I have a brain cyst, the size of a pea, in my pituitary gland that almost completely shut off the signals from my brain to my testicles (they are healthy, pituitary gland isn't). My endocrinologist doesn't know for sure if this is the exact cause, but the only way to find out is surgery and luckily my cyst is in no way life threatening. So I will just live with it. 


Everything made sense and people took me seriously for the first time ever. I started on a couple different testosterone treatments (Axiron first, then testosterone cyp, then Clomid (had to stop due to estrogens), and back on test. cyp for almost a year and now permanently). 


I've lost 65 pounds since then, almost all my fatigue is gone for the first time ever (YAY), I have facial hair and something much more important than I thought. 


Throughout puberty, I never had sexual desires. None. I Googled it and assumed I was asexual. I masturbated, but only to feel normal. I just did it to do it. I also was afraid my nuts would just shrivel away. What I found throughout all of this is that I have been missing out my entire adolescent and the start of my adult life. 


I experienced sexual attraction to someone for the first time when I was 21 years old.  Since then, I found out I am gay. It was like a light switch. Not only am I gay, but I feel like maybe my body is making up for missed time so I am almost always horny haha. 


I have now had 1 bad relationship experience and 2 really good ones. My life has completely changed and I am definitely ready to move on to this new chapter of my life. I just graduated in the healthcare field of my dreams. I am coming out to my mom and sister this weekend and I know they will support me. They know the shit I went through and I want them to know a side of me that I didn't even know I had until less than 2 years ago.


TLDR: Severely fatigued, no sexual desires since age 13, now 22. Doctors found brain cyst. Got testosterone replacement therapy and now I am happy, healthy and gay. 

This sub has been there for me multiple times and I really wish everyone on here the best of luck. You guys literally helped save my life.

4,"Gay guys that constantly make a point about disliking ""gay culture"" and how they don't want to be associated with it.


What's the deal bros? And why is it that they're usually guys who just have a chip on their shoulder? Bonus question: Do these guys put aside their objections when they're getting a good banging? "
5,"I was having a hard day at work, boyfriend did the best thing ever for me. What does your boyfriend do for you?


I had gotten into a confrontation with coworkers. Nothing too serious, regular kind of stuff. Vented to the boyfriend. I got home and he surprised me by handing  me pajamas and a chocolate milk (he was already in pajamas) and he held me close from behind while we watched Futurama. He ruined my bad day completely, I almost started crying. He's the best :)

I want to get him back, any ideas or personal experiences?"
6,"Do you like your own dick?


Despite being just 5' i like mine. I like the way it looks. Its not curved, it doesnt have a big head, or a weird shape or anything.
I would suck it anytime, if I could. "
7,"Close friend committed suicide last night


Nobody saw the signs, and now it's too late. But it's not too late for anyone else who's dealing with depression.

If you know anyone who is suicidal or in a psychological crisis, there are resources for you out there! Anyone can call national suicide prevention hotlines, including concerned family/friends.
