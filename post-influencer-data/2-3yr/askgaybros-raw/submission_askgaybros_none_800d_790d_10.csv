0,"Just Proposed to my BF


I didn't do anything fancy. Just told him I couldn't take it anymore not letting him know how I feel. He said yes! We haven't told anyone yet, but I'm so excited and wanted to share"
1,"If a hot guy bends over, do you check to see if his underwear is showing? I almost always do. If there's also a butt crack flash, that's the icing on the cake.

2,"Maybe it Southern culture but if i hear one more Christian straight dude say that gay relationships are about lust right after thinking God for their smoking hot sexy girlfriend i'm gonna scream...

3,"A year ago


I couldn't even tell myself I was gay... 10 minutes ago I came out to my parents. I've been a longtime lurker on this sub, thanks for helping me out."
4,"What do/did your grandparents think of you being gay?


My dad was an abusive man. More so to my mother but if I ever acted 'like a faggot' he'd hit me or just start to taunt me about my supposed (I was pretty young) homosexuality. He's now in prison. 

If you had ever met my father and seen how he behaved you would guess he came from an abusive father or a broken home. Nothing could have been further from the truth. My grandparents were warm and loving. 

My grandpa was a veteran of the Vietnam war and my grandma was a teacher. Both were faithful presbyterians and were pretty religious but never judgemental. 

When I came out to my grandpa (at this point my grandma had passed) I was worried. He was loving but spdue to his age I expected a bad or a less warm reaction than I hoped for. Nothing couldn't have been further from the truth. He was shocked but he said he accept s me and he loved me. He said he hopes I find a guy who loves me as much as he did. He actually emailed me when same sex marriage was legalised and congratulated me. 

He pass d a couple of days ago. It made me wonder about other people's experiences. Please tell me yours. ðŸ˜Š"
5,"Somebody accused me of being homophobic.


I was arguing with someone regarding a proposed bill in my country, giving stiffer penalties to pervs who share nudes of women and children without consent.

I was saying, that men can be victim too, why not a law that protect men and women equally, and she was saying, women don't share photos of nude men, and women are more opressed and stuff, so people deserve worst penalty if done to women. And then i was saying, men can be victims by perv men too, it's not about men vs. women, 

and then she goes, sure it happens, but I'm saying it because of my internalized homophobia.


Im gay


EDIT:

the article i read from cnn specifically said women and children and then left men out, but this fb page seems to clear my concern. thanks!"
6,"Does anyone else think the letters after LGBT are unnecessary and possibly make people see LGBT as less valid?


I get LGBT+ is the norm but don't the other headings like pansexual just mean bisexual but slightly fussy? 

Why does someone have to be queer? Why can't you pick something like gay or bi or trans or lesbian?

Why does asexual have to fit into it when as far as I am aware they don't want or like sex?

I'm not trying to shit on anyones identity but when I see LGBTQASSXNG it makes me feel like LGBT has been cheapened. 

I don't think all the new genders should be added to the LGBT platform unless they are happy as being part of the + because I feel it makes us seem like we have just made up how we are feeling. Why aren't all the gendee dysmorphic people happy being called trans or male or female?

Can anyone tell me what the + is for please?

I'm planning to come out this year but noticed these extra letters getting added and wasn't sure why. I definitely want to be inclusive and don't want to cause offence to my fellow non straighters, I just want to protect the sanctity of LGBT(+)."
7,"I seriously can't believe I came out last night, anyone have any happy coming out stories?


I'm 16. I was feeling seriously depressed the past few months and I figure out how to cure it. Last night I swore to myself that I would come out to my dad so I went into the living room with him and we listened to music for most of the night. My favorite song was playing when I told him, Starman by David Bowie. I don't know why it was so hard for me to say it but it took me until midnight to do so. He told me that he fully supported me and I spent the next hour filling him in on all the stuff I wasn't able to tell him all this time and he told me that he was also bi and that I shouldn't tell my mom because she didn't react well. I'm glad I told him first. I'd really like to hear your good stories about coming out to parents."
8,"Cute gay guys are making me question myself?

9,"I'm 25 and about to go on a date for the first time in my life.


I'm scared, but excited too. Any advice?"
10,"Askgaybros succeeds where it's important


I, like most others here, can become quite cynic to most everything posted on this subreddit. It's very easy to quickly dismiss posts and roll our eyes at the naive notion most questions/posts raise.

BUT - I think we should recognize that this subreddit accomplishes its most important job: giving LGBT members a glimpse of light in the darkest spaces. Let me explain.

We frequently have posters who seek advice from hostile environments. Whether as a result of their area or of their immediate family/friends. Each time this happens I am amazed at the outpouring of support and advice in an otherwise silly subreddit. Realize that this community has saved people from suicide and self-harm on many occasions. For that I think we should celebrate."
