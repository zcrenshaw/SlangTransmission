0,"I think I've figured out your guys problem with dating....


A lot of you don't seem to understand when it comes to dating it's like a business merger. When two dateable guys meet each other and hit it off it's because they both recognize the other's worth as a person. Too many of you settle in a pot of self hate and expect some guy with his shit together to swoop in and save you. THAT'S NEVER, EVER, EVER GONNA HAPPEN. 

When a guy with his shit together is out dating he's looking for an equal, essentially ""hey I got good shit, you got good shit we should combine it"" not ""hey I've got good shit going for me, you want half with nothing to contribute to it?"" 

If you're depressed go to therapy, if you hate your body go to the gym or idk get a sex change or SOMETHING. All this woe is me shit I see here is ridiculous. I understand it's not easy to force yourself into self improvement but if you want happiness you HAVE TO. You can't be a mopey self hating piece of shit forever and wonder why good stuff doesn't come your way. You HAVE to be proactive in making that shit happen and it seems like a lot of you teens, 20 yr olds and even some dudes my age (30) or older have never figured this out somehow. Stop choosing to be a sad sack and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT."
1,"It's ok to not want to date fems. What's no OK is to insult them. Do you agree?


There's nothing wrong with saying you're not into fems. But saying ""dating a fem is no different to dating a girl"", ""be a man"", ""these fabulous gays give us a bad name"", ""I find them really annoying"" etc. and all of this dumb shit that people say demeaning effeminate or gender non-conforming men is just being an asshole. Preferences are one thing, but being really vocal about how much you repudiate a group of people is another.

I'm not your typical camp gay guy, however I am GNC in a lot of ways, and I'm not gonna stop being who I am to make masculine gay guys feel comfortable because you have a chip on your shoulders because you blame us for perpetuating the gay stereotype. Nor should anyone else."
2,"There is nothing wrong with wanting companionship


I think this needs to be stated on this board despite it being an obvious fact. Lately I've seen various commentary about single men pursing relationships. At the core the advice given is solid and should be taken, but I think there is a lack of empathy that frustrates many guys here, myself included. 

This post is for those frustrated by their relationship prospects or lack thereof. I'll reiterate there is nothing wrong with wanting companionship. 

I think many men need to realize the situation at hand for many of us out there. As gay men we don't have the numbers on our side. Finding compatible mates is not going to be easy, for some it will be an uphill battle.

If you've gone a lengthy period of time without any dates, sex, or attention it starts to get to you. You see other couples straight and gay hooking/meeting up and you begin to wonder why hasn't this happened to you. You think something is wrong with you and the advice is always to better yourself which in a roundabout way tells you something needs to be fixed before you're deemed desirable. When you take these steps and nothing comes to fruition it hurts. 

All you want is companionship not Mr. Right, not Number one, but someone who gets you and can share experiences that are going on in your life at the time. After a while it feels like there's a part of life closed off to you no matter what you do.

At the core you shouldn't be desperate for a relationship. I get it. A relationship is not a band aid that will fix all your problems. I think most guys know this but many confuse desperation with excitement.

If you've gone so long without any attention and you finally meet someone that appears to be a match; I can see how that excitement would take hold and come across as desperation; thus ruining any chance you may have had. It sucks but we need to realize this. 

The point of this post is to show an alternative point of view about how some guys may be feeling. I realize what I've stated does not apply to everyone. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think they're those out there who would like to see this sentiment out there with the other advice. "
3,"If you have to be a slut, be a safe(r) slut: The guide you didn't learn in sex ed for reducing (not eliminating) your odds of acquiring / transmitting STDs.


You love sex. And you love having it with a lot of different people because variety is the spice of life. The advice you've received about the incompatibility of many sex partners and safe sex doesn't appeal to you. You aren't willing to give up *the spice of life*. But you harbor anxiety that your behavior is putting you at risk for acquiring an STD. Here is a meet-me-in-the-middle guide to being a safer slut because our community cannot afford to be cavalier with regard to STDs.

**First meet policy**

You're on Grindr, thinking purely with your dick and your phone is being inundated with dick pictures. All of the sudden that super cute guy you had a steamy conversation with a few weeks ago messages you. ""Hey! My roomies are all out for the day. I can finally host! You free??"" Ha! Even if you weren't you'd free yourself up from pretty much anything for this guy. ""Hell yes! Location?""

Don't be afraid to negotiate for safety. ""I love giving head, but I haven't really gotten to know you yet and I'd prefer to just do hjs the first meet."" These could be the very words that spare you from getting an STD. 

**Handjobs:**
If you are meeting someone for the first time, see if he would be interested in a handjob. With lube and the right care and expertise, these can approach, meet and exceed the pleasure level of blowjobs (if you don't know what edging is, learn). And there is virtually no risk involved. Agreeing to only handjobs in advance also serves as an insurance policy in case the guy's picture is deceiving or he has an ugly pp. At least your mouth isn't on it. 

**Prostate massage:**
Do you want something in your butt? Does he? It can be a toy or your finger. It doesn't have to be a penis. If the dude you're talking to wants anal, see if he'll go for a prostate massage instead, especially on the first meet. Experts in tantra testify that there are no greater heights of pleasure than the prostate massage. Instructional videos and articles abound online. Get googling.

**Blowjobs:**
You've heard people say use condoms. You didn't listen. You're not going to listen. I won't belabor that point here. But you can space bjs out! If you got or gave spontaneous, random head, wait 6 weeks. Any symptoms? If no, that's a good sign. It's not dispositive evidence that you have nothing. But it's better than not waiting. A lot of STDs will create symptoms within that timeframe. So before you switch to a new guy, wait 6 weeks. If you develop symptoms during the 6 weeks, or at any time for that matter, a sore, or fever, or cold symptoms, do not do oral during this time and go to a doctor if symptoms persist. Inspect his penis with an eagle eye before putting it in your mouth. Don't brush your teeth before you give head. Again, handjobs can also be fantastic. You'd be surprised how much of a thing they are for some guys. 

**Rimming:**
Pretty much the same advice as for blowjobs. But think about it, tickling a butthole with lube on your finger feels a lot like a tongue! If you were blindfolded, do you think you could tell the difference? Also, with rimming, cleanliness is paramount.

**Anal:**
Condom. Every. Time. With or without PrEP. If you are not on PrEP and you are all about anal, get on PrEP and still use a condom. It's not like preventing pregnancy. Pulling out is not enough. . . yes, I know you saw what I did there.

**Kinks:**
The good news is that a lot of kinks are safe! Go find yourself some nice feet. Go dress up in an anthropomorphic wolf costume. Go get a big old booty spanking. Go get your nips twisted. Go be someone's servant boy. When this becomes too hot to handle and you need to get off, handy, or footjob. 

**Nonsexual activities**

**Massage:**
This is a great alternative to having sex with someone on the first meet. Featherlight touch, deep tissue, oils and candles--there are so many ways to make these better. And it's the perfect activity to do before a handjob. 

**Cuddling:**
Very fun alternative to risky sex on the first meet. If you're not into the guy, dodged a bullet! *May lead to reach-around handy.

**Kissing:**
Meningitis is a big problem for our community these days guys. There should never be pressure to make out with someone if you don't want to. Just give a handy instead. If making out is non-negotiable just be vigilant about the symptoms of meningitis. 


**Conclusion/TL;DR**
If you follow all of this advice, you can cancel out *a fuck ton* of the risk associated with promiscuous sex and give just as many guys just as many orgasms. If all gay men followed this guide, we wouldn't be the most at-risk group anymore. How amazing would that be?

EDIT:

P.S. ""But this guy is way hotter than the ones I usually get"" is not a good excuse to cave on safety. Negotiate from the same place of strength that you would if the guy were meh.

EDIT 2:

Number 1 post in the sub. This is quite an honor gentlemen. Thank you for reading. I hope it's useful. It has certainly provoked a useful conversation. I'm proud of *you* that this is so well-received, because this is important shit. You're a bright bunch. Thank you for your input. 

EDIT 3:

Following this advice is not a substitute for being tested regularly. 

EDIT 4:

If there are some parts of this advice that rub you the wrong way or that simply wouldn't do anything for your enjoyment, ask yourself if there are any parts that would require very little sacrifice on your part. This isn't a guide I'm holding up and saying ""thou shalt follow this guide and this guide only."" This is also an exercise about thinking statistically about your own behavior. 

EDIT 5:

I have been accused of slut-shaming and being judgmental. I cannot agree with these characterizations. Sexual behavior is linked to physical health in good ways and in unfortunate ways. Because we are MSM, we are in the same boat. We have a shared epidemiological interest in promoting sexual safety. The safer other guys are, the safer you are. For the people who will not take a single piece of my advice, I still love you and would be friends with you and I wouldn't shame you or judge you. If you think I'm shaming someone, I want to know why.

4,"Awkward gym exchange


At the gym yesterday after a workout I spent about five minutes in the sauna.   Another guy was in there.  Had some small talk about nothing and hit the showers.   When I came out of my shower, he was coming out from his.    Back at the lockers, I toweled off with my back to him.    He said ""is it weird if i compliment your tattoo?"".   I said thanks and looked at my arm.   He said no your other one.   The other one was on my hip/ass cheek.   Then he turned and clearly had a boner and smiled.   He said it's a shame to cover that up as I put on my underwear and blushed.  

I may have been interested in this guy but in my mind he was pretty aggressive.   Am I being too hard (no pun intended) on him?    Should I just stay polite and ignore the situation when I see him again?"
5,"When straight people make you roll your eyes...


What are some things that straight people say that makes you want to roll your eyes?

Here's some:

*""My dating pool is so limited!""*

*""I wish I could date the same sex, it'd be so much easier!""*

*""I bet all the guys want you!""*

*""I wish I could be gay so I didn't have to put so much effort into impressing women.*""

""*I wish I could go around having sex without the risk of pregnancy.""*

6,"I just got out of prison recently AMA


*Hey thanks guys for all the great questions feel free to keep asking away I'm going to sleep I'll be back in the morning

**I'm back!"

Have you guys done this before? Agreeing to hookup on grindr, met up, but just said ""no"". Care to share your story?"
8,"Told my friend


Hi I don't know if any of you guys care and I cant post on gaybros but I told my friend that I was gay today and I feel really good about myself. I told her through text because I thought it was best and she totally understood and supports/love me no matter what. I'm just really happy and I feel like I'm taking a big step into the life I want to live :)."
