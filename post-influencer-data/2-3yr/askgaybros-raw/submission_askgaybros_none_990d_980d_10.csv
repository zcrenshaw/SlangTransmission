1,"First time with another dude was pretty amazing + I came out


Hey guys

I just came out to my best friends a couple days ago and it was probably the best response I could've gotten. We all live together in an apartment (they are 3 straight guys) and we were all just hanging out chillin and I don't know what came over me, but I was drinking so I had that liquid courage flowing and some hot guy came on TV and I was just like man I would fuck the shit outta him. Lol they all looked at me and were like what? And I was just like yea man he's hot as fuck. One of them was like you're gay? And my cockiness kinda faded now lmao and I was just like... yeah... And they all jumped on me and they were happy for me and 2 minutes later it was like nothing happened. It's hard to put it all in words but it was fuckin awesome. 

So still high on all that, I downloaded grinder to start meeting other gay dudes or at least see who's out there. I messaged a few guys and I talked to this one guy for hours. He's hot as fuck and he almost seemed too good to be true. He asked me to send him a few pics of me (not nudes) so I did and he almost thought I was sending fake pics lmao. So I guess he thought the same thing about me and it was kind of flattering really but he was like lets send a new pic and ill send u a word to write down and u send me one and we hold it up. So we did that and it was legit. We've been talking non stop since and I finally met up with him yesterday on Christmas Day at night and we just smoked a little bit and chilled and he asked me if I'd wanna fool around. I posted on here already that I have some shit I needa work through and I wasn't really looking to hook up at all, but I had told him about some of my ""reservations"" I guess youd call them and he was cool with it and said he could relate and we didnt have too if i didnt want to and all this other shit. Feel like I really connect with him so I gave in even though my heart was beating fast as fuck. I don't know how to explain it but he made it really easy and I felt comfortable as fuck with him. I said something about never sucking dick before and he told me the first time he sucked dick he used his teeth a lot and that eventually it gets easier with experience though he said hes only been with a gew guys. And he said how hes only been out for less than a year so a lot of gay stuff is new to him too. But yeah I ended up giving him head for a little bit and jerked him off and eventually he did the same to me and it was really fuckin hot. He has a roommate too, but I ended up sleeping over in his bed and we sort of cuddled and it was nice. I went home early and showered and did some stuff for work and we hung out again today and just talked and laughed and it feels like I've known him my whole life. Still too soon to talk about dating I think but hes mad chill and I just thought I'd share some positive news. Hows everyone doing?"
2,"Patterns of attraction: Results


Guys guys guys,

I’ve been blown away by the response to the [survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5lfn3p/patterns_of_attraction_who_attracts_who/) I posted just a couple days ago. I was expecting a couple hundred, tops. But you amazing, curious, helpful people really came through, with *4,412 responses*.

So I’ve been collating most of the day and all of the night, and am now thoroughly sick of spreadsheets.

I’m by no means a statistician, just a slightly geeky person, so please, for the love of god make a copy of the sheets and improve on my no doubt amateurish analysis - and share back with everyone!

Importantly, this shows you some stats that are mostly only useful in relation to each other. As in, the sheet on say, bottoms, will tell you a bit about them, but it’s far more informative to compare it against tops. In this example, you might look at the bottoms sheet and conclude that bottoms are really often white people! But no, it’s because most of the respondents were white, and both tops and bottoms were white people.

The juicy stuff will come from picking apart the *comparisons* between demographics.



Here’s how the sheets work:
The first set of sheets called “blah stats” have numbers and charts on all the aspects explored. The second set of sheets is the raw data backing them. The last sheet is all the responses put together. For the geeks, the second set of sheets are filters on the last sheet, and the stats sheets use the indirect function to refer to the data from the filter sheet.


Some very interesting/unexpected things:

* Tops were much more likely to be attracted to a vers partner than bottoms (bottoms were more likely to want someone further on the top spectrum)
* Bottoms were less likely to be muscular, but were strongly attracted to muscular men. Tops were too, but more preferred “athletic” types
* The body type results are interesting. E.g. most “curvy” (overweight) people had a preference for “average” body types, while “thin” people preferred “athletic”. As expected, muscular preferred muscular, and athletic preferred athletic. Very muscular men were not especially often chosen as an ideal partner’s body type.

There’s much, much, much more than that. Let us all know what you find!

Sheets for you:

3,"[NSFW] [UPDATE] Had sex for the first time last night with told older men, went really well!


[Link to previous post about the hookup] (https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5ji5dq/will_likely_be_losing_my_virginity_to_two_older/)

When I first posted about meeting up with these two men in their early 40's, I got a lot of responses that kind of told me to reconsider. I am very happy to say there was nothing to worry about, it went really well!

Before I even get there, they tell me to be careful on the roads and to let them know when I'm leaving. They greeted me very warmly, took my coat and hung it up and all were just all around great hosts when I met them. They showed me around their house (really nice house, gave off a very...warm and comfortable feeling?). They have three nice dogs that they adopted from shelters (someone owning a pet from a shelter gives me a positive impression of them). I learn that they have been together for about 15 years. They have threesomes once a year if that, but after last night, they wouldn't mind more with me. Even just to hang out. If I wasn't concerned about being seen with two older men, they wanted to take me to see the new Star Wars with them.

I sit between them on the couch watching The Hobbit that was on when I got there (they're both into geek stuff yet are very masculine men, perfect). We talk for a while, I have some water, and they just make me feel comfortable. After a while, the one guy asks me to move a bit closer to him. He kisses me on the cheek...then goes to my mouth. And we make out for a minute or two. My first real kiss, and it was the hottest thing ever. I get on him and straddle him. He was a little aggressive with the kissing, some tongue even, but I had 0 problems with this. I wanted this for too long. Through this entire process, he is asking me and making sure I'm comfortable and that I'm OK with things. Made me feel safe and comfortable. I do the same with the other guy, although he is less aggressive with the kissing. 

Eventually, we get to undressing ourselves with a small game of strip poker. I feel like I read all the time that you shouldn't expect to have sex with men with large dicks like in porn. Well, these two guys were the exception. They told me they were 8in and 7.5in, but I was pretty shocked to see them. They were both large and thick. I sucked both their dicks...It was great. Again, they didn't want me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with, but once again, I was so into it that I was perfectly ok with it. They suck me as well, I hold off on cumming though.

Then, we move out into the hot tub, still all naked. We make out, the one guy eats my ass a bit. I'm still feeling really comfortable and am very much enjoying myself. Both guys are into me as well. 

Soon enough, we leave the hot tub and move into the bed room. We make out more, suck more, eventually the one guy makes his way to my ass and eats it, plays with it, all the while I'm on top of the other guy kissing him, sucking his dick. So this is what a threesome is like, huh? I was so turned on and hot. 

Once the guy who was playing with my ass felt I was ready, he pulled out a box of butt plugs with small/medium/large sizes. He bought these and a bottle of lube just for me! He lubes me up and the plug up, and starts inserting it, making sure I'm comfortable and wants me to tell him if its hurting me. We take our time and gradually do this until I can handle the largest size. All the while, we're making out and all that. They also coach me with breathing techniques. 

Then, when I'm ready, the guy with smaller dick puts on a condemn and slowly enters me, I'm on my back, taking it missionary style. It hurts a little, but its the ""hurts so good"" feeling? Of course, I tell him when too much is too much, but eventually my ass gets used to it, and then he really gets into it. It's pure ecstasy. I start moaning a bit, and start to really ask for it. We change positions and I'm on top and kissing the one guy, while the other guy (with the small dick) is taking me from behind and on top of me. It hurts a little, but I feel very good and comfortable. I feel myself start moving my ass in rhythm to his thrusts. Soo hot. Eventually, he cums. It was great.

They're not done yet though, as the other guy (with the bigger dick, also the one who initiated this whole thing) has yet to take me. This time, I ride him. He is a bit large, it hurts a little, but after a while, I my ass gets used to it. I ride him and then lean down to kiss him as he thrusts. He really gets into it. I move my add up and down his dick. The other guy comes over then and sucks me dick until I orgasm from his sucking and from the other guy being inside me. 

I have never felt such an intense and pleasurable feeling before. It lasted much longer then if I masturbated. The guy fucking me though still hadn't reached an orgasm. He flips me on my side and fucks me on the side for a while, then flips me on my stomach and holds me close, I'm loving this close intimacy and feeling him inside me. He could tell I liked this, and eventually he cums from this.

Afterwords, we kiss a little, they offer me a shower, and then I get dressed and they order pizza. We eat pizza and watch a movie together. I cuddle with the guy who initiated the whole thing, kiss a little and he gives me one last blowjob before I leave. I wanted to stay all night, and they were totally cool with that too, but being home on break with at my parent's, I had to get home at a reasonable time (told them I was hanging at a friend's house). As I leave, I'm told to text them when I get home, they wanted to make sure I got home safely (it's been icy lately, plus cops being out for the holidays).

Overall, this was perfect. Nothing at all to worry about as this couple was caring, comfortable, kind, passionate, and all around great human beings. When I'm free and back and school without parent's asking where I'm at, they want me back again, and this time I'm staying an entire night.

EDIT: I was expecting my ass to be sore, but it's not. It feels perfectly fine. They knew what they were doing.

EDIT 2: Wow guys, um...I'm glad you guys enjoyed this post going by the likes and comments. If you try hard enough, I'm sure you can find the right guy/guys to do this with. Really, I just got lucky and made a smart choice.

4,"Self Improvement in 2017


Happy New Year gay brothers.  I’ve enjoyed getting to know lots of you here in askgaybros in 2016, and think it’s a fucking awesome community and discussion forum full of great info and perspectives.  Figured I’d take this opportunity to share some nuggets of wisdom that I’ve picked up over the years, in case it might help anyone here in the coming year with ideas for self-improvement.  Something I’m always trying to do too.

I’m a happy, healthy, successful 44 yr old gay guy, have dated a lot and been in several relationships, and feel like I know a few things about a few things.  I don’t have it all figured out, nobody does or ever will, and I have my flaws just like everyone else.  

Take what you want from this, or nothing at all, up to you.  But if anything here speaks to even just one person and makes a difference in their happiness, it would already make *my* 2017 better:


- We each are responsible for our own happiness, nobody else is responsible for your happiness.  If you find yourself in a shitty situation, look at yourself and the choices that you’re making, not for somebody else to blame. Being able to do this is the number one difference between being a boy and being a man.

- No matter what you look like or what your ethnicity is, lots of people find you attractive.  May not seem like it, but it’s fucking true.

- Social media addiction causes anxiety and depression.  Just like drugs, alcohol, food, or sex, too much of something is a really toxic thing.  I keep all push notifications turned off, and check it when I choose to.  Not when my device squawks at me for attention.

- People aren’t paying attention to those things you’re insecure about as much as you think that they are.  People are so busy thinking about their own stuff, that they very often don’t even notice or care if you’re a skinny guy working out at the gym, or have a scar on your body.

- My 20’s were confusing as hell, and I wouldn’t wish them upon my worst enemy.  The idea that gay death occurs at 30 is ridiculous and untrue.  It was at age 30 that I first felt comfortable in my own skin, and life has only been getting better and better literally every single year.  And I bag just as many hotties now at 44 as I did when I was in my 20’s.

- People are good, and the world is not a dangerous place.  Don’t be fooled by the false perception that the media creates.  The world portrayed in the news, on Facebook, on Instagram, and even here in askgaybros, is a hyped-up and sensationalized version of the actual world that you and I are living in day-to-day.


Be bold and courageous, make a move on that cute guy and don’t wait for him to, actively create the world that you want to live in, know that people love you and care about you no matter what, be the type of sexy, horny guy that you want to be with, dicks are awesome and delicious.

Cheers gaybros, have a fucking kick-ass 2017."
5,"Anyone still use incognito mode even if they're the only one who uses their computer?


If I die, I don't want my family to unlock my PC and see my porn habits. "
6,"My dad is gay


My dad was in a 20 yr relationship with my mom before he came out as gay. Now let me explain a bit further, he and my mom had been divorced for years and he had been living with his boyfriend (who I described to all my friends as his roommate) for most of those post divorce years before he came out. I was too young to really understand, about 8 when my mom and dad divorced, the situation and it was something I didn't give a lot of thought to. But as I grew up and I went to high school and I would invite my friends over they would quite ruthlessly explain to me that my dad was gay. For the longest time I would deny it. He hadn't come out yet and I, being as naive as someone could possibly be, refused to believe it and I would deny it. High school was kind of rough. I was known as the son of the gay guy, completely unbeknownst to me. My house got TPed and egged. My friends (one of who would later come out as being gay) would make fun of me for it whenever I was being a dick. It would become my soft spot.  You wanted to get to me? you made fun of my dad. What could I do about it?

This led to me resenting my dad. I blamed him for the hardships I felt I had to endure on his behalf. I was not nice to him. I can't really explain how bad I feel about some of the things I said and how bad I think I made him feel. I was in high school and angry at the world because my life wasn't perfect. I still am ashamed at myself for some of this. 


As time has gone on my dad and I mended our relationship and have managed to stay close. Him, my sister and I regularly have a get drunk and hang out night.  We've spent so many hours talking and discussing all of our feelings that at this point in time we couldn't be in a better place.

Last year, his husband was diagnosed with HIV. The doctors think he may have had it for the last 15 years. I did not handle this news well and I got very angry with him. I said things I am ashamed of. Instead of respecting the gravity of his situation of being diagnosed with something as serious as HIV I was blaming him for risking my dads health. My dad's test results came back negative to my relief. It's now over 12 months later and his husband is the leader of a group dedicated to helping other positive people in our state.



I don't know if this even belongs in this subreddit as I'm not even asking you gaybros anything. I've never written or spoken about this, whether it's been anonymously or publicly. I might even delete this later because it's so personal but I wanted to share my story.


"
7,"Came out to my mom and now I'm going to a church psychologist, need advice.


I came out to my mom over the holidays and she said we should go to her psychologist to discuss if I was for sure ready come out to everyone. I agreed seeing as it would be nice to have someone to talk to with no filter. 

Well, I find out on the drive over (he's in another state) that he's actually a church psychologist from the video I had to watch. It was an hour long video about what made me gay over my lifetime, it was scary accurate with the points it made. 

My thing is that before watching the video I was sure in myself, I had finally accept that I would never have the traditional family. After watching the video the promise that I can be ""fixed"" ignited a false hope in me again momentarily.

Well even if I did do what was recommended it would be like the last 10 years of feelings in my life were a lie. The amount of work I will have to do almost doesn't seem worth it to ""fix"" me. Also, being fixed according to this program is just replacing the urges with love of God, but they would never leave.

My mom was getting frustrated with me saying that I've been fighting this alone for so long, and that with help I can overcome it. She was saying I was selfish for not wanting to giving this a chance and that I can still be normal. I'm starting to feel bad, and that I should try every measure before coming out to the world just so I know for sure.

Also my mom is really doing what she thinks is best, she's had a week to process this, while I've known for half my life. So, I don't really blame her even though she's not doing a good job.

I'll be seeing the dude in a few hours, I'll keep you guys updated.

TL;DR: Came out to mom. Promised unbiased psychologist, but I am now going to a church dude who will pray my gay away in another state. Feeling guilty for not trying wanted to do program that will ""fix"" me.


***The update was put in the comments, sorry I didn't know you could edit posts.***

8,"Smoking


Just an appeal to younger gay guys on this subreddit: Please, don't ever start smoking. 

I've been thinking about it in the wake of Carrie Fisher's death. She smoked heavily for years, and it's probably why her voice had become so gravelly, not to mention her heart problems. My best friend is ~50, about ten years older than I am, and he's already having blood pressure issues and other health problems. I have the sense that he's probably going to die from it in the next ten years. Another friend who smoked for years suffers from COPD. She eventually stopped only because she had to. My uncle died a nasty death from cancer from years of smoking. 

Don't make your friends and family watch you destroy your health. 
"
9,"It's official, just came out to my mom (22)! NYE


I have finally got the guts to tell my mom that I am in fact gay. Her response? ""It's okay, I already knew. I still love you"".

One thing that I didnt understand however was how she kept on saying ""Just keep women as an option too - dont restrict yourself to men""

I knew deep in the back of her head she wanted me to marry a women by her saying that...But i just agreed to compromise with her even though I know I like guys.

I finally feel better. Like a weight off my shoulders. Now I can tell my parents (well mom) whether or not if im going on a date or not. 
2017, IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT YEAR!

10,"Patterns of attraction: who attracts who


************************
UPDATE: [RESULTS HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5llicn/patterns_of_attraction_results/)
************************

Are tall men more likely to be tops? Are buff guys more likely to be feminine? Are Middle eastern guys more likely to prefer other middle eastern men?

In order to learn what kind of guys we are statistically attracted to, I made this fairly in depth survey, and I'd love you guys to answer. 

https://goo.gl/forms/WUJHGXRWiHfdbLy22

Totally anonymous, and I'll of course share the results.

Please suggest any alterations, and please answer honestly! 

The patterns should be pretty fascinating!

Edit: there was another survey a while back, but that one focussed mainly on masc-fem perceptions and attraction. I'm hoping to get a lot of interesting data about a lot of aspects of attraction.

Please share with your gay friends, and thanks for taking the time


Edit: it's past 4 am here so I'll be back with results tomorrow, some analysis and the full results. Keep sharing and answering! Here's some early teasers:

* Wow you guys are **white** and young!

* Broad spectrum of top/bottom, as well as lots of love for masc and fem

* 50% attracted to muscular men, less than 5% identify as muscular themselves

* Most popular ideal man's role is 100% vers

* ""Very muscular"" men are as attractive as ""very thin"" men

The most interesting stuff will be the correlations, e.g. **who** likes **what** but that'll take some analysis."
