0,"Retail worker I've wanted to ask out (update).


A follow up from yesterday's post (link below)...

https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5167ie/attracted_to_a_retail_worker_at_a_local_store_and/

I can't explain how excited I am right now! The guy got in touch with me through Instagram about an hour ago. I used my credit card yesterday to purchase the gift and he obviously looked me up using my full name (lucky for him, it's not very common).  My insta also has quite a bit of evidence displaying my sexual orientation so after seeing it he probably just went for it. He sends me a message and the conversation went like this:

Him- ""Hey dude, I'm the guy who works at ________.  I know I'm taking a big risk here and I've never done something like this before, but I wanted to say that you're cute and seem to be a really chill guy.  I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime and get to know each other some more.  If this is too weird and you're not interested, I understand.""

Me-  ""Damn it, I should've paid with cash! Hope you didn't take down my card number either ;).""

Him- ""I tried, but it wasn't the number I was looking for..."" 

Me-  ""Well I found the number 10 both times you were in the store. Guess you haven't looked hard enough, but maybe I can help you next time I come in :).""

Him-  ""Or perhaps when we go out for some drinks...My number is ___________""

Me-  ""Id like that.  (Gave phone number).""

And from there we've been texting and planning to meet up this weekend.  Didn't think this would ever happen, but it looks like it is.  Lot of weight off my shoulders, too. "
1,"My first gay love


Lady here. I ended up at a gay bar tonight after having accompanied a gay coworker to a wedding. I don't know if I could say I've ever felt one particular way about gay men before tonight; its always been a fully neutral opinion since I don't have any long-time gay friends or out family members. I mean, I take a liberal stance politically because I'm not dumb enough to think there's a human rights separation, but, you know, point is I've had limited personal interaction with the gay community at large. 

Anyway. My coworker was smashed and on the hunt for the D so I found myself mostly in solitude at our table on the smoking patio. We actually joined a table of two guys who knew each other due to a busy Friday night with limited space. One was also wasted, and the one I was next to appeared wholly introverted with full-on bitchy resting face. I prodded him a bit for conversation out of boredom, and he opened up rather quickly. He was kind -- deeply kind -- if not mellow and solemn. But he had these eyes you just trust, you know? 

After some preliminary conversation and more drinks, we get really comfortable with each other. By now he's complimented my dress and told me I look beautiful, and I'm feeling like a million bucks and just telling him everything. We reach the topic of my single-woman status and he asks why I'm not out there. I'm so relaxed at this point I go full-on honesty like he's my damned therapist or something, and I explain that I'm 37 and barely beyond my virginity and I have trouble with sexual encounters because I'm on the cusp of asexuality with a huge preference for personal connection over orgasm. He doesn't act shocked. He doesn't judge. He doesn't pry for more information. You know what he does? A sloppy drunk straight man comes up -- I swear to god, right in the middle of that topic -- and gets touchy-forward with me. My new friend doesn't miss a beat, he grabs the man by the forearm and goes, ""This is my girlfriend, have some respect."" The shocked man apologizes and retreats immediately. 

At this point I've known Mr. Fantastic for no more than 15-20 minutes. That's how quickly I opened up. And in that little time, he takes me under his wing, respecting me and my sexuality even within his bar domain of prominently homosexual sanctuary, and protects the shit out of me. 

It was an extremely meaningful night for me in terms of my exposure to the gay community. I've never experienced that kind of selfless, calm generosity and respect from a man in my own sexual community. I'm having trouble finding the words to describe my gratitude. All I know is that I will spend the rest of my life trying to return the favor by protecting my gay brothers (and sisters) when they're walking in my shoes as an ""outsider"" in my ""domain."" No one will ever hurt you while I'm nearby and get away with it. "
2,"24 - Returned to my hometown - High School Straight Crush Just Sent Me a Snap, ""Want a cuddle buddy?""


I love reading true stories like this, so I'm just here sharing mine. 


I moved to Chicago for college and then Los Angeles for work, but now I have returned to my small hometown in north central Illinois. I only really talk to one friend from High School, but there are a few that I randomly keep in touch with or run in to. 


One of those being ""Tom"". Tom is a few weeks older than me. Blonde hair, blue eyes, blonde scruff (my kryptonite). He was the kicker on the football team, as well as a member of the basketball and track teams. Plays the guitar. He's a babe. 


We didn't keep in touch during college, other than running into each other over holiday breaks. Our friendship always remained the same after I came out.  He is a cool dude that I have always respected. He's always had many, steady girlfriends. I have never really had the inclination that he was gay/bi/curious. And as us gay dudes know, gaydar is real and almost always right. But he has never set off any signals. 


He now works as a budtender (legal cannabis dealer). We haven't hung out at all for months. About a month ago, he hit me up to see if I wanted to chill and smoke. I'm not a big smoker, and right now I'm a prospective employee, so I said ""I'd be down"", but in actuality I've been avoiding it, because I don't want to smoke and then have to drug test for a job. I didn't hear from him for a couple weeks until last night. 


I woke up at 2am to pee and on my phone was a snap from Tom. He had sent it about an hour ago. It was a black screen, clearly in a dark room with the text that says, ""Want a cuddle buddy?"". HOLY FUCK - *Did I read that right?* *Blood rushing* :O 

I responded with black screen, ""Yes.""


It's now the morning after and he just opened it. No response. Which is understandable since no one wants to low-key cuddle in the morning. 


But now I'm questioning it all. Did he send that to the wrong person? I don't think so. If so, he would have noticed and sent another clarifying the mistake. Was he high? Probably. But does that matter? 

What is a cuddle buddy, anyway? Just casual spooning? A little action? A lot of action? Honestly, I'd take any of it. 

Well the weekend is coming up and I'll keep you updated on any further developments. 


P.S. - Apparently I'm the straight-guy-whisperer. If any of this develops into more with Tom, I will have successfully messed around with all three of my straight high school crushes. Hopefully completing the trinity will unlock the gates to Valhalla. WITNESS ME.

3,"Homophobic tourists


I live in New Zealand, and my BF and I enjoy going to this park that's fairly popular with tourists. The only problem is, we've had tourists stare at us non-stop. Especially Arabs. I don't stare at you for wearing a burqa, so why are you staring at me for being gay? If they don't like the level of LGBT rights here, they can just leave."

5,"A word of advice to all ""bros"" frustrated in their search for Mr. Right (or Mr. Right Now)


#IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.

Did you have a good date with a new guy and are frustrated because he hasn't texted you back yet? Did you have a bout of enthusiastic texting back and forth yesterday but today you haven't heard from him yet? Did he have to cancel your plans and now you're feeling suspicious?

Remember kids--the guy you are into is a real person. He had a life before you two started talking, and part of that life involved being an imperfect, flawed human. And furthermore, remember that if you're only just talking or starting to date, *he has no obligation to you*. Maybe he turned his phone off for work or a movie and forgot to turn it back on. Maybe he's tired out after work and needs time to himself because it takes energy to devote to getting to know a person. Maybe he saw your message, told himself he'd respond at a more convenient time, and simply forgot to get back to you. Maybe he's just as nervous as you are that he's going to get hurt and has no idea what to say back or when is the right time to message you again. 

I see a lot of people get frustrated when they feel like they are being ""played"" with, but try to keep in mind that everyone is the hero of their own story. The guy on the other end of your interaction is, in all likelihood, probably *not* maliciously seeking out romantic hopefuls like yourself so he can fuck with your emotions and have a laugh about it. He's probably just, you know... not perfect!

Be empathetic, bros. We're all quite capable of being ""that guy,"" so instead of taking it as a personal affront, take a moment, breathe, and remember that you are dealing with a real person. 

Oh and for goodness sakes, give up on the fucking straight boys."

7,"Girls usually aren't nice to me until they find out I'm gay. Anyone else experience this?


I experience this a lot at school and at work. Girls (obviously not all, but a lot of them) are very unfriendly until they find out I'm gay. After that, they're really nice to me and will sometimes act like we're friends, even though I hardly talk to them. Does anyone else experience this? I know that a lot of girls feel more comfortable around gay guys, but I want to hear everyone else's thoughts and experiences."
8,"Straight guy here feeling confused after a gay experience


I (m26) live with a friend (m28) and we have been living together for sometime, I know he is gay and it has never been an issue, we each let the other know if we are bringing someone home and we get along fine.

He has never made a pass at me or flirted with me before now and that's part of what has me confused.
I was lying on the couch watching TV a few nights ago when he arrives home and sits beside me, we chatted about random shit for an hour then he suddenly mentioned how good I was looking.
I thanked him and before I could say more he kissed me.

I didn't stop the kiss and openly encouraged it, I hadn't felt like that before but I enjoyed it.
He then started undressing me, I helped and before I could say anything to stop him he was sucking me, after that I couldn't say much and he kept going until I came.

Then we curled up on the couch for the night and eventually he went up to bed.
I enjoyed it and I don't know why, I have no interest in guys, never have, but already I'm wondering whether it will happen again or if we will go further with it.

Has anyone else gone through this?"
