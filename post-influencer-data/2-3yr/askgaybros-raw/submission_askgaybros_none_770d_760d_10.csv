1,"Update: Need some advice. My son is 17 and seeing a 24 year old man. How should I proceed?


I saw all your messages about my previous post and got a lot of good advice. Multiple people mentioned that I should arrange a meeting with my stepson's boyfriend. Today in the morning my wife and I relayed the advice I got from here. We talked to our stepson and how we wanted him to be happy, but we were also concerned for his safety. Our son admitted to us that he didn't want to say anything because of the age difference, but the boyfriend was very nice and they haven't even had sex yet. My stepson is active in his school's LGBT club and a friend of his in the club introduced him to his older brother, which is the 24 year old. We got down to the business about him moving in with the boyfriend and he said that he was only considering moving in with him once he got a job. Our stepson isn't sure about his post-high school plans and was just juggling around his options. We asked to meet with his boyfriend and he was able to come over to our house for an early lunch. His boyfriend is an actuary and lives within reasonable distance of our neighborhood. He finished up his education and basically just works right now. The boyfriend was polite and seemed like a decent guy. Thank you for all your advice and now my wife and I are glad we met him and got to properly introduce ourselves."
2,"The 4 Worst Things the Bottom from Grindr Said to Me Yesterday During Sex


In order of how much they shrunk my dick:

> Fuck me all night!

It was 4:30 pm.

> Oh God, my pussy! Ow, my pussy!

Putting aside the problematic use of pussy, the way he would talk about his didn't make me feel strong or virile, but made me legitimately question if he was hurt. I had to say while fucking him, ""Please don't say that.""

> Your dick is so big!

My dick is like 5-5.5"" and not especially thick. I'm perfectly happy with what I'm able to do with it, but come on! 

> I love you.

Aye aye aye. "
3,"The number of young men only wanting to bareback is alarming


I live in a college town in California so there's a decent number of young guys 18-30 who like to fuck. I've met so many tops and bottoms alike who simply refuse to do it with a condom. It's kind of scary. I know prep is supposed to be great but I don't know if that's a good enough reason to fuck strangers bareback. Have you noticed more and more young guys going bareback only? "
4,"Help/ I walked in on my son watching gay porn


I am a single mother with one son who has just turned 15. Just last night I walked in on him watching gay porn in his room. I am pro LGBTQ and has always been, and I feel like I speak openly about it infront of my son, which is why I am upset that he didn't talk to me earlier. Not only that, but I can tell he's avoiding me which gives off very awkward tension. I'm not sure how to talk to him about this issue and I know some of you had a similar issue with your mother and I want to know how she/you fixed the situation. I did not know where to go for this answer, so I figured a forum page would be the best. I cannot stand him avoiding me so I really need to figure out how to talk to him about it! Should I tell his father? Or should I talk to my son about it?"
5,"What are your favorite Grindr translations ?


Mine would definitely be after asking ""What are you into ?"", the guy goes ""I'm into anything really"" which just translates into ""I want to see how you answer first because I don't want to reveal I'm a power bottom who likes getting his ass eaten just yet."""
6,"Jay-Z's mom, Gloria Carter came out as Lesbian in his song Smile



This is his verse on her:

>Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
>Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
>Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
>Society shame and the pain was too much to take
>Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
>Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
>I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
>Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

This is her verse:

>Living in the shadow
>Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
>In the shadows people see you as happy and free
>Because that's what you want them to see
>Living two lives, happy, but not free
>You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
>The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
>But you live with the fear of just being me
>Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
>No harm for them, no harm for me
>But life is short, and it's time to be free
>Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed
>Smile

I was just casually listening to his album and it took me by surprise and gave me goosebumps. I almost cried listening to those 2 verses. I hear coming out stories all the time, but never of a middle aged, formerly married, black lesbian whose son holds a high status in today's society. The lyrics were so simple and powerful.  

I just thought it was cool and would like to share it with you guys "
7,"Do you ever just want gay friends?


I know most of the topics here cover relationships and sex but what about friendship? I mean if you're with a bunch of straight people all the time you become a bit of a novelty especially around women i find. My guy friends are fine. We mostly talk about random politics. They're not the type to talk about relationships which is good. Still sometimes it would be nice to have more guys that can talk about gay stuff right? Or even just to relate on some level about mutual similarities. What do you think?"
8,"My mother kicked me out for being gay yesterday, advice?


I'm 19, living in a moderately sized southern town. Yesterday I receive a phone call from my mother telling me she can no longer ""put up with my lifestyle"" and doesn't want me to ""influence your siblings"" and that I'm on my own. This is bullshit for several reasons, I haven't so much as alluded to any guy's I've been with let alone spoken to her about it. And my younger brother and sisters are all above 10 at this point and still haven't even the slightest inkling of my preferences. I can't say I really understand her decision, it's been a year since I came out to her. Only 8 months since we'd discussed the possibility of her having a relationship with any boyfriend I may eventually have. She's chosen her beliefs over me, I suppose, even then, she is sleeping with her boyfriend out of wedlock. NOTHING MAKES SENSE. I don't have any family here not just as religious/spiteful as she is. Not sure what to do.

The icing on the shit cake is that I had just moved back here to live with her for a time while I saved up for a better car, so for a while I've been out of a job and basically broke. I had actually just found another job an hour before she broke the news. However, I don't start till Monday. I do have a pretty old car I can sleep in with some level of comfort. My current plan if you can call it that is to keep couch surfing until I can get lucky with Craigslist, currently no such luck, I don't have the money for a large deposit and first month's rent. I'm in a bit of a jam, I'd appreciate any advice. 

Edit: I appreciate all the responses guys, really. I feel better knowing that there are some options out there for me that I didn't originally consider. Last night I laid awake for hours thinking about everything from ""where does one buy a solar powered heating stove?"" to ""being a male prostitute surely isn't that difficult"". But now, I feel more secure in that something will come along, thanks again. "
