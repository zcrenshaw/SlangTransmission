0,"Bottomed for my bottom after 5 years of topping. Very glad I did.


I'm a top. Always been a top. Tried bottoming at various times and never kinda worked for me. With my partner everything's been perfect since he's a complete bottom and I'm a complete top. Everything else was perfect too. We got together 5 years ago. Married 1.5 years ago. Best thing we ever did.

So a couple of weeks ago he comes to me at night and tells me out of the blue that he wants to fuck me. I was surprised. Honestly what came into my mind was that is it possible that he's not sexually satisfied? He always seemed to be. We talked about it a little, he told me that it's something that he needs at this point in our relationship and it's not about sexual pleasure. He didn't want an immediate answer, just asked me to think about it.

Well. I couldn't think about anything except it. On one hand I'm not a bottom and never enjoy it, on the other hand this is what my husband needed and I have to make sacrifices to give him what he needs. I struggled a little but it eventually came to the fact that I'd do anything for his happiness and if it's what he wants, then sure. Last time I bottomed was 7 years ago and I didn't like it at all. Maybe things had changed, maybe not. What's the worst thing that can happen? I tolerate a little discomfort for the needs of my husband. I'm sure he's done it for me. I'm not delusional, I know being a bottom is much more difficult than being a top. It needs preparations, diet, it has after effects, hell, I'm not the one with cum in my ass after we have sex. He does all of that every time. Now that he wants me to do it just once, how the fuck can I say no?

So I told him about a week later that I'm ready whenever he is. He was happy. We finally did it last night. I was nervous but was ready to tolerate a horrible experience for his pleasure and joy. It wasn't a horrible experience, just not that great. Honestly the sexual experience was as bad as it was all those times. I'm not a bottom, that's for sure. But he enjoyed it. Very much. It was actually a pleasing experience psychologically. Seeing him enjoy himself a new way alone was worth it. But it wasn't just that. I was getting dominated by the person who's always submissive to me in the bedroom and that felt good mostly because I knew he was feeling good. He came in my ass, a first for me. He loved it. Now he thinks we've fully ""coupled"" since we've both came in each other's asses. Not sure why coming in mouth didn't count towards that since he's come in my mouth many times. But that's irrelevant. He later told me that he really needed it and thanked me extensively for it. Told me that he knows it must have been difficult and he'll never forget it. Well. Anything for him. He said he doesn't need it often, just every once in a while is enough. Maybe once every few months. I can certainly do that for him.

Now a day's passed and I'm so happy that we did it. Such a small price to pay for making my partner happy and comfortable.

I wasn't gonna write about it. I was curious what people might think about the subject and search around a little and found a few threads with people having similar experiences with their partners and things not ending desirably. So I thought I add my perspective. If you're in this position, just do it guys. Don't think ""I'm top/bottom, he knew it when he chose me so why do I need to change, he's unreasonable"". People change. Sometimes they want to experiment, sometimes there's a psychological need, sometimes they just want to see if you're willing to come out of your comfort zones for them. So show them that their needs and their happiness is more important to you than what makes you comfortable at the moment. It's a small price to pay to ensure your relationship remains healthy and caring."
1,"Orlando club shooting


I hate when these things happen, and don't even have much to say. But it deserves to be mentioned here. And yes, it's a gay club. 20 dead, more injured, gunman shot and killed by police. 

http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/index.html

Edit: The above info is from the first report I saw. At this point I'm not going to edit or update the numbers as I think it's unnecessary. I haven't read any recent updates from news services because, frankly, it's too painful for me, and so I'm not yet ready to try to find more recent, accurate info. But I'm sure you can find it. "
2,"Is it irrational to be pissed off at the highjacking of Orlando by muslims?


When fifty members of the LGBT community die because of a man's religious beliefs, I dont want to hear about how the ""real"" problem is islamophobia and how this will affect peoples perception of islam. I don't fucking care."
3,"Today, I completely tore down the closet.


Today, I ripped the band-aid and told everyone that I'm gay.  While the Orlando shooting was easily one of the most horrible stains in American and LGBT history, I decided that one of the best ways to counter whatever negative feelings I had in the last 48 hours with something I should have done a long time ago.  To be visible and to show that members of the LGBT community comes in all shapes and sizes.  To show people that ""yes, you do know someone who is gay"".  To show that not only am I gay, but also many other things that define who I am -- a man, a son, a brother, a friend, a confidant, an engineer, a traveler, and, more importantly, a human.

 


Maybe it's because I can sympathize with the victims and families being a Navy Yard shooting survivor.  Maybe it's because I didn't want to be angry, frustrated, or helpless any more.  I don't have the power to bring people back even though I wish.  I think I did it because it is the smallest gift I can give to counter this giant movement of hate.  If I can start with my small group of friends, especially since now I live in a somewhat rural, conservative area here in Maryland, I hope my coming out will give them a moment of empathy to show that us gay folks and folks who don't fit the typical gender norm are still people.  If one person can view the LGBT community more positively because I came out, I did my job.

 


My apologies for not asking a question.  To meet the criteria of this , I have one question to make sure that this post is legit -- what is your favorite flavor of ice cream?"
4,"I just came out to my parents!


Long time lurker of /r/askgaybros here. 

Honestly I didn't even plan on coming out to my parents. They're fairly conservative people, and often talked a lot about how I was gonna find a girlfriend, have kids, and all that jazz. I've been talking to them a lot about LGBT issues/news recently (before today), and a lot of their responses were very lukewarm or rejecting. Needless to say, this wasn't the plan.

Fast forward to today, and we're eating dinner. I'm just kind of talking with them when suddenly my mom asks me if I'm dating anyone. She starts pressing me then finally asks ""are you straight""? My face got so red and it had that weird tingly feeling I usually get when I'm super nervous about something. I told them I was gay, totally expecting them to just be super disappointed or mad.

Instead, I think they took it pretty well! They told me that they loved me no matter what, and although I think they'll need the time to process all of it, I feel just... a lot better!?!? I had only come out to a few friends before them, but ughhhh I was so nervous about this.

(Still shaking) Oh my god. At this point, I don't know if I'm just super happy or if I just want to sleep.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this out aaaaa"
5,"Difference in support after Orlando?


I want to start by saying that I'm not the one to be SJW-y. BUT I have noticed over the past day or so that many of my friends who posted on social media and changed their profile pics after things like Paris and Sandy Hook have been largely silent about the attack and I can't help but think that it's because of the location and targeted victims. I've really only seen my gay friends and very committed allies say anything about it at all and while I'm not personally slighted I feel a bit disheartened. I'm not saying my friends are homophobic or bad people but they seem to be less willing to talk about an event that affected specifically the LGBT community.

Am I alone in feeling this way?


EDIT: Also the fact that the GOP politicians can't even acknowledge that gay people were targeted makes my blood boil."
6,"The divide here is really heartbreaking


Lately on this subreddit (and various others honestly) there has been this us vs them in regards to the Muslims and us being part of the lgbt group. Its been a bit sad really.   I guess I just don't see the point in broadening the finger of blame or wondering if they support gay marriage or lgbt bodies in general. 

I just feel that in the wake of this tragedy, I personally, wouldn't want to spread hate further.  The only person I blame is that man who did all this. He made a choice, he deserves whatever consequences he gets."
7,"Piss play saved someone's life!


I do sometimes like to engage in piss play, especially if the other guy is into it as well. A few days ago, I got in touch with another guy who I have messed around with a few times before. We are kinda fwbs but not exclusive. Well, I found out that he was also secretly into watersports/piss play. So we met up and we did it. He pissed in my mouth and his urine was actually really sweet! 

Like it kinda tasted like McDonald's Southern-style sweet tea! 

This was very abnormal. Urine isn't supposed to taste this sweet.

I asked him if he had eaten anything really sugary prior to this, and he said no, he never eats anything before sex. So I joked with him and told him to go to the doctor because he might have diabetes! 

He did go to the doctor today and he was diagnosed with new onset diabetes. He has just texted me this. He says he had a sugar of 560 and he is in diabetic ketoacidosis! He had to stay in the hospital.

Any similar stories?"
8,"Brother just came out. What can I do to support him?


Sorry if this question gets asked a lot, but I'm hoping for some advice here. Also if this is the wrong place to ask, my apologies.

I come from a very conservative Christian background. I have a brother who is much younger than me and we have never been terribly close -- mostly because of the age difference. My parents, who are great people, really, and were wonderful parents, are very conservative politically and religiously.

So I got a call from my mom today that basically said to call my little brother because he was ""going through something"" -- her words. He lives in a different state than I do. So I did. And he shared that he is gay, has always been gay, and has been in a relationship for quite a while with someone whom he loves very much.

I told him that I loved him and supported him. I told him that I would always be happy to talk to him if he had problems with our family, who apparently have already been non-supportive and somewhat ostracizing.

I don't think that I've ever been a good big brother, really, partially because of our age gap, I suppose, but I wanted to let him know that I am here for him. I worry that he'll feel estranged from his family because of their beliefs, but I want him to know that I am his family too, and I am happy for him and love him regardless of what anyone else may say. Me keeping the peace with the rest of my family because I feel this way -- that's another story.

Anyways, I hope I've done the right thing so far, but I was hoping to ask you all what the best thing for me to do for him could be, if there's any other way I can tell him that I love him and that regardless of what shit is coming down the pipe from my family, that I'm here for him and I accept him, as well as his current relationship. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you!

Edit: Thank you so much everyone for your advice. It's all great and very helpful! I feel like I can be a better brother now."
