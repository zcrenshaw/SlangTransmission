2,"Republicare will cut back access to PreP - increase spread of HIV. Thoughts?


http://time.com/money/4693379/healthcare-hiv-prep/

Fuck you if you continue to support Trump and the Republican party. If you call yourself Republican, Conservative or Libertarian then you're a fucking moron, straight up. Not only are you duping yourself and ruining the lives of millions, you're holding back progress in ways that will effect you directly! You might not need the government's help getting Truvada, but the next guy you fuck around with might and... Oops! You guys caught HIV as a result.

The GOP does not give a shit about you if you're gay, stop lying to yourselves. They don't really value conservative economic policies, stop lying to yourselves. They only care about enriching the already-wealthy and they use conservative and religious rhetoric as a means to that end. That's the fucking truth.

Such a god damned shame."
3,"""Am I the only one who ..."" questions


No you're not. 

Just stop.

If you can find people who are into getting pooped on, then I am pretty sure you can find other people who ""are into chubby guys"" or whatever."

6,"He surprised me.


I've had the longest two weeks ever, 50+ hours a week. It's been nuts, today I come home from work and he's sitting on the couch with a ring box. I open it to a beautiful ring with 3 diamonds. He said that since we're getting married soon, he wanted me to have diamonds, not the gold band he gave me 5 years ago. I'm not trying to humble brag, I'm just melted that he thought to do that, it's not his style. Have faith fellow gaybros, your prince is out there. [ring] (https://imgur.com/gallery/wC72E)"
7,"[UPDATE] I proposed to my boyfriend with a little plot twist... ;)


[More than a month ago, I asked you if I should propose to my boyfriend, even if we can't get legally married in our country...](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5ouvu2/should_i_propose_to_my_boyfriend_anyway/)

I was scared that he may think about this as a joke, or that it'll be just cheesy.

With your encouragement, I actually did propose to him, two hours ago, during our anniversary dinner...

#He said yes.

But what's the plot twist? Well, some of you may know my fiance as u/CIaptr4p!

Thanks to his favorite subreddit, I could learn what he thinks about my idea, without ruining the surprise.

Thank you, r/askgaybros!"
8,"BF Embarrassed of Wealth


Hey there. Long time lurker but first time posting. 

About two weeks ago, my bf invited me on his family vacation to Hawaii. I was super excited and left all the planning to my bf given this was his family's vacation. We got to Hawaii a couple days ago, and little did I know we were not staying at a hotel but rather at his parent's vacation house overlooking the ocean. I ended up looking up the house on Zillow and seeing his parents bought it for $6.3M a few years ago. 

My bf lives a very modest life. He drives a pretty basic car, lives in a basic apartment, and is a doctor for low income Americans so his salary is relatively low. I think it is fair to say, I had no idea his family's wealth. 

It is just really weird for me now why he never mentioned that his family is worth 10s of millions. I get the vibe that he is somehow embarrassed by the degree of his family's wealth. Anyone have similar experiences and if so, how do you deal with it? 

EDIT: Ended up talking to him over lunch today. Basically told me he doesn't consider the money to be his, rather he just got lucky. As a result, he doesn't like to talk about it/use it because he feels he wants to work on his own rather than rely on his parents. He also told me when he does inherit half of the money, he wants to build some type of charitable foundation. Got to see a new side of him today and makes me pretty happy."
9,"Do hot straight guys ever take advantage of you?


I was thinking how its funny how straight men let attractive women get away with things,

but I realized maybe gay men let straight guys get away with things too.

MY friend (he's gay) lended $8 to another guy he thinks is cute and always gave him rides when his car broke.

anyway, weeks later when my friend needed a ride, the cute straight guy didn't want to help him cause he didn't wanted to wake an extra 10 mins to pick him up in the morning.

I asked my friend ""why aren't you pissed?
he said ""nah its cool, he's a cool guy""
I'm like ""you mean a *hot* guy, you wouldn't let him get away with this if he was some random guy or chick""

thoughts?"
