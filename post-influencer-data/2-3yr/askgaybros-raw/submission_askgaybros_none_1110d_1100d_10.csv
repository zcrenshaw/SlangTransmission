Then I was born.

1,"My platonic brotherly love for a younger friend has turned romantic. His reaction to my confession (sort of) is confusing me.


UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/50s53o/update_my_platonic_brotherly_love_for_a_younger/

&amp;nbsp;

Alex (my love interest) and I have known each other for 5 years. I'm 24 and he is 19. We're British, for context. His sister is one of my best friends and I met Alex when I went to their house for her birthday party. Unexpectedly, Alex and I hit it off right away geeking out over a book he was reading at the party (we're both massive bookworms).

&amp;nbsp;

Subsequently, we hang out quite often because we have many similar interests and I really enjoy his company. He was the first person I came out of the closet to and he was absolutely cool and supportive of it. It has always been completely platonic and I loved him as the little brother I never had.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to this year when he got accepted into a school near my apartment. He was looking for a cheap place near his school, and I offered my spare bedroom for free. He accepted it happily and in return, offered to do the chores and cook my meals.

&amp;nbsp;

I can't say when it started exactly, but at some point of time, I started seeing him in a new light. I fantasize about him being my live-in boyfriend. I stopped looking for dates online and in bars, and instead, looked forward to going home after work in the evening to sit down to dinner with him. It doesn't help that he is attractive in appearance and personality, and he's a great chef. I think of him when I jerk myself off. He has fallen asleep on my bed a few times after a late night of reading together and it always makes me stupidly happy to stare at his beautiful sleeping face and fall asleep next to him.

&amp;nbsp;

Up to this point, I don't know his orientation. He hasn't been seeing anyone, none that I know of. For some, 19 is still pretty young to figure out this stuff I guess. I personally only figured myself out at 20. In any case, I'm in too deep so it doesn't matter.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday evening, over dinner, I commented that he's probably got all the girls falling over at his feet because of his culinary skills. He laughed and, after a sort of dramatic pause, said  ""yea, I'm gay though."" My heart did somersaults. I'm happy that he's gay and maybe my fantasies will stop staying as fantasies. I managed to congratulate him for being out of the closet blah blah blah, then blurted out something stupid like ""How did you find out?"" He blushed and said there's a guy in class that he has a crush on. I'm jealous but I'm trying to play my role of supportive buddy, so I asked, ""Are you going to do anything about it?"" He said, ""No, he already has a girlfriend."" Awesome, I thought to myself, then asked him what kind of guy he is into. He described someone who sounded suspiciously like me, especially the ""someone who likes books as much as I do"" bit. My poor heart was on a roller coaster. Maybe this was the big moment we were all waiting for.

&amp;nbsp;

""What do you think of me?"" I asked.

&amp;nbsp;

""Huh?"" He looked at me, confused.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm the one who's confused. I thought he was dropping a hint on me.

&amp;nbsp;

""I mean, your ideal guy sounds an awful lot like me. So, what do you think of dating me?""

&amp;nbsp;

""But, you're my brother.""

&amp;nbsp;

The angels stopped singing and my heart plummeted.

&amp;nbsp;

""But, I'm not?""

&amp;nbsp;

""I've always thought of you as my older brother."" he said, really, really awkwardly.

&amp;nbsp;

Then he blushed and looked at his food and I didn't know what else to say so I stopped talking and looked at mine. There's awkward silence except a lot of slurping from Alex who suddenly looked like he's trying to set the world record for being the fastest eater. Then he got up, announced that he's going to rush a project tonight and ran to his room and shut the door.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought that was that and I spent the night sleepless, maybe weeping into my pillow a bit to mourn my unrequited love.

&amp;nbsp;

I managed to sleep somehow and woke up late to find Alex getting ready to leave the house. Things are still awkward, he won't look at me and we don't banter like we usually do. He looks really tired too and possibly hasn't slept all night like me. I go to the door because I want to see him off.

&amp;nbsp;

And, here's the kicker. As he's about to step out of the house, he suddenly stands on his tip toes and plants a kiss on my cheek, which is something he has never done. Naturally, I was all ????? I was completely taken by surprise and he's gone by the time I compose myself.

&amp;nbsp;

What was that about? I'm inclined to think that he wants to return my feelings but is too shy to say it. I can picture him doing that. Or am I being too optimistic and it's really a ""no matter what happens you're my brother"" type of kiss? I'm so confused. I have this text typed out on the phone ""What's that kiss about?"" but I haven't sent it out. I'm worried about making this situation worst and possibly reading too much into it. He's coming back in about five hours and I'm all anxious. I don't want to do something that scares him away. I've never been in a situation like this or cared so much for someone. What do I do next? 

&amp;nbsp;

I apologise for the wall of text. Got carried away and did not realise how long it was until it got posted. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a tl;dr : Met my crush 5 years ago through his older sister. It was purely platonic until he moved into my apartment this year. He came out of the closet last night and I asked him if he'd date me after he described his ideal guy which sounds incredibly like me. He says he thinks of me as his older brother, then kisses me on the cheek this morning. ?????

&amp;nbsp;

UPDATE: Overwhelmed by the interest, concern and advice. Thanks! It is morning and I'm just out of bed. I thought you guys deserve a quick update because I'm going to be busy for the rest of the day. After Alex came home, everything went on like normal. I didn't do/say anything stupid. Instead, I did something pretty smart if I can say so myself (which I'll elaborate on when I can do a proper update) to dispel the awkwardness so that we're talking and bantering like the bros we are. We had dinner, watched tv, then did some reading on the couch. We got into a debate about our reading material. I gesticulated with my hand in the air, and when I brought it down on the couch, it fell conveniently on Alex's hand (It was purely an accident, I didn't see it there). His palm was facing upwards, and I acted on my instincts and squeezed his hand. He was looking at me when I was talking but at that instant, his face coloured and he looked back at his Kindle and I thought, well, I screwed up again in record time. Naturally, I withdraw my hand, and then, I realised I can't, because he has interlocked his fingers with mine. I looked at him and he was still staring intently at his Kindle. There's a faint hint of a smile on his face. Before I could think of what to do, he pulled his hand away and said he's going to bed. He pecked me on the cheek and ran off to his room. We're spending the whole day together later (got advanced tickets to a play). I hope we'll be able to talk and I'll have more substantial stuff to update. Will answer the questions to this thread that I haven't answered too. I'm glad I don't have cardiac problems. My heart is working overtime and I haven't slept in 2 nights."
2,"In regards to the ""why are so many gays leftist"" post...


What's sad is the downvotes will be used as a talking point to say, ""See, you can't express any conservative thought here without being downvoted to hell!""

I actually upvoted him when I read the title and the post. It seemed like an interesting conversation to have. When he started being deliberately obtuse to everyone who answered, then I downvoted.

You can express a conservative thought here and not be downvoted, but don't pretend that reality isn't what it is. You can't say the Republicans haven't embraced the religious right when they so clearly have, and you damn sure can't pretend that you don't realize gay people are a minority. And don't ask someone to list their reasons for their opinion when they just did so in detail.

But no, we just all hate conservatives."
3,"[UPDATE] My best friend is in love with me and I love him too


Hi, bros! This is an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4zbvo5/my_23m_best_friend_23m_just_admitted_that_hes/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4znwk9/update_my_best_fried_admitted_that_hes_been_in/)

-----

Since I have a key to Andre's apartment, I waited there for him to arrive. I planned what I was gonna say. I had a script prepared in my head. I also got him tulips (his fave) and made him some pesto fettuccine.

He was supposed to arrive at around 10 PM, but it was close to 11 when he did. The whole time I was waiting for him was pure anticipation. I had so much butterflies in my stomach that I felt like I was gonna explode.

When he got there, he didn't seem really surprised to see me. I said hey. He said hey back. Then there was some awkward silence which was even made more awkward when I gave him the tulips. Then he laughed and asked what the tulips were for. That time I was ready to tell him everything. I was going to pour my heart out, but my nerves got to me. I couldn't talk so I just hugged him and tried to put into that hug everything that I wanted to tell him. It took him some time to hug me back, and when he did it felt like everything fell into place.

-----

We spent the next hour talking about everything that happenedâ€”his admission and my breakup with Tony, among others. We also decided not to start dating right away because didn't want to rub it in Tony's face. He said that he's waited forever; what's a couple more months of waiting.

And just in case any of you is wondering, we didn't do any nsfw stuff. Well, unless you count kissing as nsfw. Hahaha. BTW, our first kiss was  awesome. His lips were so soft and we were smiling in between kisses. We also cuddled until his arm started to cramp. Then I kissed him one more time and went back to my place. Even though it was around 2am, I still decided to leave because I know what would happen if I didn't. Can't trust myself. LOL.

So that was it. No big romantic gestures. Nothing overly complicated. What I did was not rocket science. It was just an act of love.

-----

tl;dr: Finally told him I love him, too.

P.S. I'll post photos of us (from our childhood to this day) as soon as I finish the imgur album. :) And oh, I'm going back to his place for brunch."
4,"""Haha you're a fake gay""


Here's the thing: I'm pretty bi. But I'm about 99% gay. I get a total turn on for guys. However, maybe it's nyc, maybe it's the fact that I grew up in Staten Island, maybe it's that guys think I'm some guido muscle douche. But honestly, it's a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation.

I'm not big on the gay scene. Never been. I go with my buds to gay sports bars or bars. But I'm not the type to be ""part of the culture"". I don't watch Drag Race or worship BeyoncÃ© (or Queen Bey) and Lana del Rey. That's not to say I judge those who do. Anyway, I've been taught to respect those you come in contact with. Here's where my annoyance and dilemma begins. 

I met a guy from Chelsea on Grindr. We decided to go on a date. When I told him my hobbies and interests he seemed interested but joked that I'm ""just a confused straight boy"" and ""I'm too butch"". Too butch? 

I didn't make any comments on how he presents himself as a masculine muscle jock online. Yet he ""looooves Britney and Riri"" in person. Live and let live.

My question to you bros is: what's the deal with gay men's subtle dislike for guys who aren't ""part of the culture""?

It's not the first time it's happened to me. But this is the straw that broke the camels back"
5,"[Serious] More of a rant than a question: I regularly have to break it off with guys because their dicks are too big.


People are gonna say I'm trolling, but look at my post history. I'm a dude with a history of having a hard time bottoming. 

I want to be vers but every time I meet a guy and hit it off, he ends up being huge (the smallest has been 7 inches. The rest are 8-10 and thick like a redbull can). Because it is so tricky to find a good guy, I tend to try to make it work, which basically means I become an exclusive top. For the 7"" guy I managed to bottom, but only with like months of trying, tons of lube, patience, a set of graduated plugs and dildos, and lots of praying. I am sick to death of sex being such a chore and I never want that again. It kills the spontaneity and I hate it.

Obviously the world average is around 5-6 inches, and the fact that I have never seen a dick under 7 inches in person defies those odds. I have to conclude that porn has set unreasonable standards and all you &lt;7"" dudes are hiding.

**SO**, I need to shout out the under 7 inch club. Please don't be shy because of what you're packing. Is there a guy right now that you're afraid to chat/hook up with because you think he'll judge your D? Fuck him if he does. Please know that there is at least one dude (me) out there who is outright craving you. 4 inches? Amazing. When I finally unzip a dude's pants and see a dick I can take, I'm gonna lose my mind on it.

Just needed to get that off my chest. Go proudly into the world, under 7"" club. When I find you, you'll know it's me.

6,"[UPDATE] My best fried admitted that he's been in love with me for five years


Hi, bros. First of all, thanks for all the advice and kind words. This is an update to the events that transpired [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4zbvo5/my_23m_best_friend_23m_just_admitted_that_hes/)

-----

So I went to Tony's place last night with a heavy heart. I had come to a decisionâ€”one that wasn't easy for me to make but still one that I had to.

When I got to his place, I felt like Tony already knew what was coming. I told him about what happened over the weekend. He listened to every word I said and every time I looked at him, it felt like I was breaking him into fragments. When I told him that I realized that I have always been in love with Andre, tears rolled down his face. It wasn't easy seeing him in so much pain, especially because he didn't do anything wrong. It broke my heart when he held me, cried, and begged me to stay. It was a very painful moment. I love him, but not as much as I love Andre. It sucked having to end our relationship like that. We had a great year, but it wasn't fair to any of us if I lied to him and to myself.

I didn't want to be the guy who left his boyfriend because his best friend admitted he's been in love with him. But I also didn't want to be the guy who stayed with his boyfriend knowing fully that the circumstances made him realize that his heart has always belonged to someone else.

-----

Is everything fair in love in war? Maybe, but that doesn't mean that it's any less painful especially when you have to choose between two people you love and who love you.

-----

tl;dr: I broke up with my boyfriend after I realized that I've been in love with my best friend.

7,"Do girls you meet become friendlier to you once they find out you're gay?


It just seems like everywhere I meet women, be it work or school, they always seem kind of cold and distant from me when I try to be friendly which is totally understandable since it might be interpreted as flirting. But once they find out I'm gay if I casually mention my boyfriend it's like they change completely and drop all their walls around me. 

Does anyone else experience this? It's just annoying when women always think I'd be flirting with them when all I try to do is be friends"
