1,"What do you think about this garbage article outing gay athletes in Rio?


[This](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/11/i-got-three-grindr-dates-in-an-hour-in-the-olympic-village.html?via=desktop&amp;source=twitter) article published this morning in the Daily Beast features a straight, married ""journalist"" trolling Grindr for gay athletes in Rio.  Is this as shitty as I think it is?

Edit 1: The Daily Beast has completely removed the article.

Edit 2: Rio: it is time to revoke Nico Hines' press credentials."

Yes, this is stolen from the front page, cause most of the top answers were either jokes or from women."

What makes you feel good about this sub?"
5,"Is anybody into being naked in nature?


So I used to streak and skinny dip with friends when I was younger, but as someone in my later 20's I've had to cut that out since most people I know my age aren't really into that stuff anymore, plus the reality of getting arrested for indecent exposure is scarier as an adult with a perspective. So it's something I haven't indulged in for awhile, and I mostly forgot how much I enjoy it.

But then yesterday I was going on a bike ride and decided to stop by a national park nearby that I've never been to before. It was in the middle of the day and there were some people there but not a whole lot. I went walking through the main trails which were pretty wide but I eventually came to a much more narrow set of trails that seemed more isolated. I even had to push some brush aside as I went so it obviously wasn't a popular trail.

After a few minutes of walking on this narrow path I got the good sense that nobody was near. Suddenly, I had the urge to strip down and walk the path completely nude. I fought the urge for a few minutes, considering the consequences if I was caught, but eventually decided that if I was smart and cautious then I could easily get away with it.

I took off my shoes and socks and hit them by a tree that I could come back to on my way back. The path was mostly just dirt so my bare feet could handle it. Then I took off my shirt, boxer brief, and shorts and held them in my hands as I walked. I kept an ear out for any noises nearby as I went. I figured if somebody was walking I could hear them coming from enough of a decent enough of a distance to quickly slide on my gym shorts and looks like I was just taking a shirtless stroll.

And boy, did it feel great being naked in nature. It was so free, so raw and natural. I loved feeling of the nearby plants and trees brushing up against my smooth skin as I walked. It gave me such a rush, partially because being naked outside is just something that is hard to do these days. Was it dumb of me? Of course, but it was so much fun and I think the risk of running into someone was low enough that it was worth it. I probably won't do it again at that park just because I feel like this sort of thing is like Russian roulette and I'm bound to get caught eventually.

Anyways, has anybody else ever done something like this? Anyone have similar nudist tendencies?"

7,"My best friend found out his deceased father was gay


Hello bros. I'm a girl. Yesterday, mi friend tell me he just found out his father was gay. His dad passed away several years ago. I never meet him. Right now my friend is devastated. Yesterday he keep crying telling me if his dad was happy even once in his life or if his dad lived a lie. My friend really really LOVED his father and can not stand the idea of his dad being miserable or frustrated all his life. His father keep the secret and only a couple of people knew. He did it for his family. He never cheated on his wife. My friend keep saying ""my father never had a plenty life"" ""A closeted man can be happy?"" He blames himself. I don't know how to help, he came to me for comfort. I told him ""It was your father's decision"" and ""You don't know if he was unhappy"". ""He loved his family very much"" I don't know what else to say, i really want to help. He is my best friend. He is an only child and a good son. I need some advice please."
8,"I just got a new job and my boyfriend is mad I won't pay off his credit card bill.


He says: ""If you don't share your money now, how can I be sure that you'll share it in the future?""

Am I going insane, or is this incredibly tactless of him?"
