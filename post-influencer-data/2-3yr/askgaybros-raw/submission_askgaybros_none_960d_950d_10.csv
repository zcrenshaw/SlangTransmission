0,"What is the smoothest way you've ever been picked up or witnessed a pick up?


I'll start.  Gym I go to has a lot of pretty hot gay guys.  One guy was wearing a bluetooth headset, listening to music, working out, and checking out this really hot guy (guy #2).  Guy #1 puts his phone down by the squat rack when guy #2 isn't looking.  Guy #1 goes to the water fountain, then starts wandering around other machines looking around them.  He finally walks up to guy #2 and says, ""have you seen a phone?""  Guy #2 shrugs his shoulders looks around his machine, says, ""no"".  Guy #1 then asks guy #2, ""hey, could you call it for me?""  Guy #2 gives guy #1 his phone, and guy #1 calls his number, hears it over by the squat rack, goes over, fetches his phone, returns the phone and thanks #2.  Starts chatting with him.  I'm watching this go down and I realize, holy shit, Guy #1 just got Guy #2's phone number.  Brilliant.

TL:DR.  Guy pretends to lose his phone in gym, gets hot guy's number by asking him to call his phone to help him locate it."

Thanks!"
2,"I had a blind date with a white boy


I’m Asian and gay. I’m 20 a pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating so my friend set me up with this guy who my friend said was a great guy. He was very cute so I said yes. When he turned up, I walked up to him and said “Hey, I’m Calvin” and he looking shocked said “your names Calvin” paused then said “that’s weird you have an American name” and I said “I am American” and he just laughed and said yeah (not in a mean way but kind of like it was a joke). 

So we walked around a little, playing Pokemon Go (Don’t judge me) and he goes “Where are you from originally”, I said “Houston” (I’m playing with him now) and he goes “no like what Asian culture, I just want to know what your Asian name is and how would you say my name in Asian” (Asian, like we all talk Asian). I just sort of ignored him but it was so awkward. He’s a college student and he acts like that what hope do I have dating? PS he also told my friend, that I was being weird, me!!!

Have any other Asians experienced this? I still can’t believe he asked me how to say Aaron in Asian! "

5,"Does anyone else find guys legs the most insanely attractive thing?


So I've thought about asking this a few times, but just thinking out loud and wanting to validate my thinking... 
I've not got a foot fetish or anything (just getting that out there) but I find seeing guys in shorts and just trainer socks one of the hottest things! no idea why but I drives me nuts! 
Bring on summer! "
6,"Do you ever look in the mirror and think, ""Damn I'm a fuckin stud?""


Because it seems like a lot of people on here have *really* low self esteem. The best advice for anyone who thinks they're ugly or worthless or have low self esteem is to fake it til you make it!! Tell yourself how fucking sexy and awesome you are until you and everyone you know believes it to be true. 

If you're fat or have other ""flaws"" put the work in to change them. Unless you are butt fuckin ugly inside AND out, you can make it in the gay world!! And the real world too!! Everyone has insecurities but the hottest people don't dwell on them, they do what they gotta do to fix that shit!! And if it's not something you can fix, then own it. You have a big nose? Make a joke about it! 

Confidence is the second sexiest trait in a guy behind a good fuckin sense of humor and they actually go hand-in-hand. Be confident guys, do what you gotta do, and guys will literally swarm to you. Trust me. 

PS I'm not a narcissist i swear "
7,"My friend is in denial that I'm gay


The first time I came out to my best friend, it was back in high school. He pretended not to hear me and did a good job of ignoring it for 3 years. We kept on being friends. He was the one to suggest we apply to the same colleges and room together.

When we got to college, his denial got worse. He kept setting me up with girl after girl after girl.  When I say I'm gay he'd say I'm not. It was frustrating. 

I got a clever idea from another friend to play gay porn out loud to infuriate him until he talks to me. I did it, he got pissed, then we had an honest conversation. 

He basically told me that he doesn't hate me but hates that I'm gay, and he'd prefer it if I didn't bring it up again. 

How do I proceed from here? Apart from how he treats my sexuality, he's a great friend. Helps me out financially and in other ways.

8,"All gay children


My brother recently came out as gay (21) and my parents didnt really disown him they just kind of brushed it off like its some kind of phase. Keep in mind that my brother didnt go to college and just works low end jobs. Whenever my dad is talking to me about how my brother is ""lost in life"" he always brings up how he is gay and thats why he is unsuccessful. I know that isnt true but i dont want my parents to associate that with me. I am 16 in high school and i have had a 4.0 gpa this far and will most likely continue to. My biggest concern is that they will be devastated to find out that their only two children are gay. So do any of you guys who are gay, have gay siblings? And how do your parents feel about it?

Edit: neither of my parents have ever been abusive. While my brother was ""turning into a teenager"" my dad had stage 4 throat cancer and was almost never home. My dad sometimes blames himself for my brother being gay because ""he wasnt there for him during his important times"" and i can only imagine how he would feel when i come out."
9,"[Update] Well, I had sex. 90% sure I did a trillion stupid things.


I literally just got dropped off back at my home by him.

Um. Wow. I think it's kinda funny/sad that I'd post here immediately after tbh but w/e.

How to sum it up? ""Holy shit"".

#So breakdown:

#Before the dinner:

I spent Saturday morning/early afternoon trying to calm down and get mentally prepared for last night. I expected it to only be like a quick hour or two long thing after movies/dinner. But the whole like ""preparation for sex"" part and reading all (and yes I read all of them) the tips/suggestions.. I took them really to heart. A few really really stood out as game defining aspects.

-First off, I am probably not ready to bottom. I haven't evne used toys at all.

-Secondly, be aware of all the red flags. A few people indicated that him slapping my butt and a few other things were ""off"". 

-Thirdly, realize I can always say no. (Mindyou I was raped so sadly this ... while I took it to heart, I know it would not possibly, could not possibly stop him from taking it from me. He's literally 6'5 and weighs at least 260 and is extremely muscular. He could absolutely break me if he wanted to. Saying no wouldn't change shit.)

-Fourhtly, and ultimately what ended up having the largest impact: I am probably not really for the full sexual act. Top or bottom, or whatever. Best to touch his dick and go home.


#Dinner:

-He was amazing

-Food was great and we were in a private booth setup in the corner. It was not ""stupid crowded"" but it was fairly busy. But I could still totally hold an intimate conversation with him.

-We talked about like skiing, how he does muay thai and some other MMA (which if anyone followed me on my last account-- that is a major turn on), more hockey (that ones is so coming down...), more hockey, a little bit about my knee injury (blew out my knee a few weeks ago), and like a trillion things.

-He was silly and put a bit of food inbetween his teeth and I ate it from his mouth. Stupid, ridiculous, idiotic. But I laughed so hard and so did he. It was funnier because he literally got sauce all over his scruff.

-Overall 10/10 would do again.

#Movie:

-Movie was shit. I authentically didn't like it tbh lol

-But I giggled at parts and it was obvious when he was gigggling while looking at me for a reaction. Which I totally did laugh back and ended up kissing him. We were in the back so no we didn't put on a show &gt;_&gt;;

#He took me back to his place:

-I haven't been in his place/ to his place. The guy literally lives in the nicest fucking tower in the entire goddamn city. Like, to walk in there was really surreal. It's a condo so it's one of those like luxury condo places. Like, jfc I saw the damn tower from university now for ages. Always looked at it as a like ""Dream goal to have"". Welp, ends up he is on the fucking 30th floor. (or 28th? I can't remeember). So BAM. I was instantly intimidated.

-Pre sex was the most awful thing ever. It was like, how to describe... awkward because I was honestly scared. And I was going to back down. I legitiamtely almost walked out and was terrified. Then he sat down with me on his couches and we snuggled up watching a little bit of TV. We got a little flirty with checking out eachother's butts, dicks, etc. He let me play with his chest a bit (which I know sounds stupid but it's like these massive muscular pecs) and we ended up kissing.

-Tongue kissing is strange and weird and I literally felt his tongue like licking my molars (wtf why). I don't know how to feel. I expected it to be better. It was horrendous.

#About 30 minutes into a GoT episode me and him both watched before (the one where The Hound and Brienne fight). He brought up sex a little more and I asked him if it would be okay if we didn't do it. He said it was totally alright if we didnt' do it and he didn't want to pressure me into doing anything I didn't want to. He said he wanted me to be comfortable.

Then I knew it, at that one stupid moment when he said that-- I actually lost my inhibition that was making me say no. I wanted to have sex with him. 

-I did the dumbest thing ever. I literally asked if I could sniff his butt.

Before people face palm so hard fucking Saturn is knocked out of orbit: I was hyper. I was horny. He has a massive butt. And he was just being flirty and I have a kink. So yes. I fucked up. But yeah.

-He looked shocked when I asked to sniff his butt and then he laughed and kissed me and said he'd better shower before we do antyhing with his butt. (HE later said he did a #2 at the movie theatre. During which time yes I thought he bailed and left me there alone... WHATEVER. POINT IS HE SHOWERED).

#Do you have any idea how much ass a massive muscular 6'5 guy has? I literally was amazed when he bent over.

Like stfu before anyone laughs ""of course theri ass is big dumbass"". But like, his ass was like sooooo fucking huge it was like wtf wtf wtf wtf. I mean I get it, he's tall and big and buff and w/e. BUT THE FUCKING THING WHEN BENT OVER SPREAD NAKED IS LIKE HOLY SHIT WTF HOW DOES THIS EXIST.

I mean of course I've watched porn before with zeb atlas and whoever before but in real life in person... like a single butt cheek was like the size of my chest (not quite) wtf.

-So anyhow he let me go to town. I have never licked an ass before lol. But it was funny and weird. I liked it, moreso because of how intimate/tabboo it is. I also liked the fact that he literally could sit on my face with it. But w/e. Like. It was crazy. And he seemed to really like it because it kept going on for 30 mins and he became a bit aggressive with his butt like shoving it down on me and w/e else.

#Also butts smell weird even after showers. I did not expect that. Nor the fact that I was aroused (pheremones?) 

-So I got even more into it. I asked if I could top him. Dude, the look on his face was 10/10 priceless. Like somewhere between shock and disbelief and being told Santa Claus isn't real. His reaction? After like 5 seconds of him thinking he literally like smirked and said hell yes.

#Little did I know what was next.

-Prettymuch he literally stood up and grabbed me (seriously. literally grabbed me) from where I was and threw me over his shoulder (I'm 5'8 but I am not fucking petite) and tossed me onto his bed. I did, in fact, shriek like a schoolgirl that dropped her mcdonalds.

-Makeout session 101. I hate tongue kisses. But him literally like spreading himself against me pinning me down making out with me was cute. 

#Then the asshole smirked after he kissed me and said something like ""You want to top me but I have a different plan in mind"". 

-K my heart froze and I litterally was ready for it. I was about to get raped for the fucking third time. ""I have a different plan in mind"". Nope, all emotion was gone. Literally for a split moment I basically died.

#Then literally in the same sentence he said ""I'm going to pwoerbottom you"".

Like... in teh same sentence like time froze and seemed like an eternity before he gave his usual smartass remark about it. Me and him literally have the same dick size so I used one of his condoms (which is funny because I still haven't bougth a condom pack before... literally... not even once :/). He even put it on + all the lube. 

-K being powerbottomed by a 260+pound 6'5 guy is both the most amazing thing ever and the most painful. I literally have brusies on my legs, no joke. First thing that came to mind was (1) holy shit he is heavy (2) holy shit his butt is big... (3) and that I came in literally his like 10th or so hip movement.

-Is cumming by the 10th movement .. bad? I feel really fucking insecure about it. He didn't seem surprised and actually laughed at it and I apologised for my shittiness lol. But yep... I have absolutely 0 freakin endurance whatsoever. 

#But during it he actually farted. Like no joke, let out a big rip when riding me. We had a good laugh about it, it was like his 3rd movement thing? Hip gyration? Thrust backwards? idk. Whatever the fuck its called. 

Is that normal? I mean I get he eats a shitload of food but still lol... is it a bad sign he farted on me? &gt;_&lt; 

But once he got off I literally did notice shit on the condom. Like idk. It's not that it bugs me, really honestly, but it was just weird to see. I'm trying to not make a big deal over it, but it was weird... that + the fart. Was he like ...? I don't want to really say it lol...

#We ended up cuddling after he got off and wiped the cum off. Apparently cum rags are actually a thing. I thougth they were a joke :/

-Cuddles and laughing and more cuddles and more laughing and joking and playing with eachother for like hours. It had to have been like 4:00 in the morning by the time we finally passed out.

-It's kinda crazy because I literally basically fit into his armpit area and used that to lay on like a pillow. 

-I also fell asleep ontop of him, which is shjocking because breathing really really was kinda disturbing and movement-causing and awkward. But I legit fell asleep with my head on his chest.

-He farts during his sleep which is funny.


#And then we woke up at about 11:00am.

-He took me out for breakfast at this fancy restaraunt downtown and omfg the everything was so good. The eggs were godlike, the bacon was godlike. I LOVE breakfast and honest to goodness I've never had so much good food. 

-Basically we spent the day after that at his place talking about video games, him and I played dark souls and like... it was amazing. Nerdy as fuck and amazing.

-It was all amazing.

-He power bottomed me a second time. Which I didn't last longer sadly. But he farted..

-More making out and shit. Idk



-Now I'm at home and feel sad. And I kinda miss him. A lot actually :/


I really don't know what else to say... I am really tired, exhausted, will probably fuck up everything tomrorow because I am so tired. But it's all so... weird? Just a month ago I wanted to actually just get hit bya  bus and now this... I feel so blessed. I honestly feel so fucking blessed I could cry. 

#Misc Notes:
1: Also wtf he was like a furnace. 

Like I get it ""I love how warm you are &lt;3"" but screw that! Cuddling him was like cuddling a water kettle. 

2: Butts always smell funny lol

3: Butts end up being bigger than you expect

4: Apparently after literally a lifetime of thinking I am a bottom I am more of a top. I honestly... am shocked. :/

5: I need to go to that restaraunt for breakfast more."
10,"Gays over 30, what is your life like?


Are you happy?  
In a relationship? Have a family?  Good set of friends?  
Do you live in a gay-friendly town/city?  
Are you where you expected to be at your current age?  
What are you looking forward to most this year?  
  
  
I am turning 30 this year, and I'm not at all where I expected to be.  Losing my hair, not really happy and no real friends that haven't moved away.  Just curious what other guys are experiencing.   
  
  
Popularized portrayals of gays in media are always young and hot or older, successful and hot.  And on this sub, so many posts have ""OMG my life is awful"" when the OP is 17 years old.  I don't really see many ""I'm 32 and things suck right now"" or ""I'm 39 and things sucked for a while but I worked it all out"".  I guess I'm just hoping for some perspective.  "
