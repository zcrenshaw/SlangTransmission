0,"Being asked on a date at a dog park


Hey bros! So, I was at the park yesterday with my dog and this guy was there with his dog. I've seen him more and more the last few weeks and turns out he moved into the area recently. 

We got to talking yesterday after making small talk on previous occasions about our dogs and the rest of it. So last night, it was just the two of us and a few other dog owners who were scattered away and he began to ask leading questions. Things like, ""are you single"", ""do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend"" yada yada. I replied that I was in a relationship but he was a fucking prick (which he is) and that we are no longer together. He sounded a little more enthusiastic and replied that he also broke up with his boyfriend a few months ago. 

He definitely doesn't come across as someone who likes the same sex. 110% macho. Tattoos, deep voice, tall and very very muscly. I jokingly said this to him and he let out a chuckle, saying the same to me. He then said that he was wanting to ask me out on a date for a while, and if I'd be interested sometime in going with him. I looked at him in disbelief and kinda started laughing and asked if he was serious. He said he was and would've asked me sooner if he really knew I was into guys. So we exchanged numbers.

I said yes to the date and we agreed on a time and place. We are going to have dinner tonight and then go to a light show in our city (neither of us have ever been to). Kinda excited to be honest. We've been in contact today and last night, and he seems to be excited also. Just wanted to share my story. Too many sad stories on here. Hope everyone is having a nice day/night ðŸ˜Š"

He said no. Just like he did three years ago.

Edit: This is supposed to be a joke"

Considering homosexuality was decriminalized in 1993, Ireland has come a long way. Gay marriage passed in 2015 through a referendum(Referendum is needed in Ireland to change the constitution)The grip the Catholic church used to have has been dying for decades, this would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.

7,"Sense8 got cancelledðŸ˜­any thoughts?


On the first day of pride month (also my birthday) Netflix cancelled probably the gayest show in the world.

But it probably makes sense because of the insane budget (each episode from season 2 cost over 9 million dollars. GoT's first season was around 5 millions per episode) and underwhelming performance. They had to fly the entire crew to multiple countries and shoot some scenes multiple times and the editing must have been a pain in the ass. Season 2 alone took 2 years to finish, so I guess a short wrap up season is not gonna happen either even if it ended with a huge cliffhangerðŸ™ƒ

Anyways, I'm extremely sad bout this piece of newsðŸ˜«"
8,"Uncomfortable and sort of homophobic family gathering


Something weird happened to me this last weekend. I was present at the family gathering with the extended family and I haven't seen some of these people in a few years. We've never really talked about my sexuality since it's none of their business (but of course they know now) and they let's be honest - they are not really the most liberal group of people. My grandparents totally ignored me for the entire afternoon because of my ''alternative'' lifestyle. Okay, no biggie, I can live with that. But imagine my surprise when my aunt asked me in the kitchen (it was only the two of us) if I enjoyed getting fucked in the ass. She asked this with the most idiotic and vile smug on her face. Thank God I remained calm and answered that I loved it although not as much as her husband. I excused myself and left after that. Why do some people have to be this stupid? They hear the word gay and all they think about is sex. It's rude and creepy. "

10,"""To be a gay man is to be a chameleon""- Article on Huffington Post


http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/jordan-whelan/what-its-like-to-be-a-gay_b_16879626.html?utm_hp_ref=canada-living&amp;ir=Canada+Living

To be a gay man is to be a chameleon, shapeshifting across corporate boardrooms knowing your financial livelihood is on the line.

To be a gay man is to lower your voice on business phone calls knowing masculinity is a virtue.

To be a gay man is to walk at night with paranoia, suddenly regretting your outfit choice or hairstyle. Because we all know someone who paid the price.

To be a gay man is to know there are parts of the world you may never visit and that millions of people in this world want you dead.

To be a gay man is to lower family expectations, accepting that Dad really is OK with you being gay when he asks you not to mention it to anyone at Christmas.
