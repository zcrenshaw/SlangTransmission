0,"Would anyone be interested in an /r/AskGaybrosOver30 spin-off sub?


Up front, thinking of this as a sibling to this sub, not a replacement.

So, I've found some really good discussions on /r/askMenOver30 and /r/askWomenOver30 lately and wondering if there would be any interest in a 30+ version of this sub. The topics that show up on the other Over30 subs tend to be refreshing in their own way since it filters out a lot of questions we stress over when we're younger and gets into topics that are on the front of your mind more after you finally start to feel like a grown up. It's not necessarily better, it's just different than usual on Reddit and sometimes provides fresh topics.

Those other two subs are just a handful of discussions per day, so I'm guessing the show up would be fairly low for us. However, I feel like even a thoughtful number of guys in the dozens could make for at least a couple good discussions per day. Also, subs at smaller numbers can have a tighter community feel early on. 

Anyway, I think that life starts to get different enough from our straight peers at 30 that we would have room for things to talk about that are unique to the 30+ gay experience. It could also be a place younger guys could drop a question if they want answers from older guys for whatever reason. There's a bit of that on AskMenOver30 and it seems like a nice way to give back and be helpful. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: Heh. This post has about five people saying they're in, but is sitting at zero upvotes. If you like the idea, throw an upvote at this post for another measure of interest and for the sake of getting it more visibility for more feedback. I promise I'm not trying to scam post karma by sucking up to the fraction of the 30+ crowd we have here.

EDIT 2: I went ahead and reserved the sub's name to prevent it getting trolled or taken. Feel free to subscribe or post, but won't have time to flesh it out until this evening. Very welcome to thoughts on how it should be run. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30

EDIT 3: So, that was more upvotes and response than I expected. The sub is live and some initial discussions have started. I'll do a more official announcement in a day or so when we have more on the sub. For now, adding quality posts and just responding to other guys is the best way to contribute and help make it a good community. Thanks for the interest and feedback."

That I know on certain days our insecurities can get the better of us. But I still think you're beautiful. And handsome, and remarkable, funny, sweet. I think you can put your mind and accomplish whatever you want. I think you're capable and I think you're amazing. Doesn't matter what you identify as, where you come from, what you believe in.

5,"Update: mother's boyfriend offered me 40k to only date women


Thank you everyone for giving me your take on this weird situation. 


I talked with my mother about this. She doesn't see any issue with him offering me the money and when I said I'm not going to accept it she asked me if more money would change my mind...


She doesn't get why this is a big issue for me. I told her I'm not taking any amount of money to not be me. I tried explaining I've spent enough of my life in the closet but she interrupted me to say I'm being immature. I hung up and she tried calling again, I ignored her.

6,"[UPDATE] Boyfriend thinks I'm too flamboyant




[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6erfm1/apparently_my_own_boyfriend_thinks_im_too/?st=J3HDMNG3&amp;sh=a648649b)

Okay - first of all RIP to my inbox! I honestly didn't expect so many people to care about a long whiny post about my boyfriend lol. But I appreciate all the encouragement! 

Alright. So tons of people asked what happened and wanted to know if my bf and I made up - so I'll try to recap that. 

I didn't speak to my bf for like a full day after he called me out on (supposedly) being flamboyant. 

The silent treatment wasn't to punish him. I do care about him a lot. He just hurt my feelings and I can be sort of mean sometimes when I'm hurt. So I've just learned to just not say anything until I've calmed down.

I guess he had a hard time with that because he's used to constant communication. (We usually text all day when we're not together). 

So when he finally ended up coming over, the first thing he said when he got here was ""are we broken up now?"" 

I told him I wouldn't just dump him without telling him and I just needed some space.

I also told him that I don't think he realizes how horrible he made me feel the night of the party. I was already nervous meeting his friends and then I left feeling good. But then he had to go and make me feel like I should be embarrassed about just being myself. 

So after I said that he seemed to *finally* get it. He said he was really sorry and he said he knows he ruined what would have been a really good night for everybody. 

I asked why he mentioned the flamboyant thing at all then. He said he didn't know, he just got worried that I wouldn't be able to hang out with his friends like he could hang out with mine because of the ""contrast"" between everybody. 

But then he said he doesn't actually want me to change... 

I don't really understand that  because it sounded before like that's exactly what he wanted. But that's good, I guess? 

Anyway, I also didn't really get his point about the ""contrast"" thing (I mean it should have been obvious before this party that I'm nothing like his friends?). 

So then I asked what his friends actually said about me (a few people on here commented that maybe his friends  made fun of me or something and that's maybe what made my bf uncomfortable). 

But my bf said his friends didn't say anything negative and it was really just his own observation that me and his friends have nothing in common. And he said that made him frustrated with *me.*

So then I honestly got kind of irritated. I mean how am I supposed to deal with someone being frustrated with something like that? So that's when I asked what in the world he expects me to do about it. 

That's when my bf was like ""well, for example when ""J"" asked if you liked football you could've just said yes or no instead of talking about the time you secretly dated a college QB."" 

(Alright. I left that out of my post bc I genuinely forgot that I even said that - that happened way earlier in the night and everyone was talking at once and I was sort of buzzed. But it's true. I did say it. I mean...there was some context too, but whatever. That's unfortunately my only connection to football so I guess I just blurted it out). 

So then I actually *was* gonna say sorry to my bf at least for that part because it wasn't in great taste. But  I didn't really get a chance because he just kept talking was was like ""it's fine though because  it turns out they all think you're really funny, and no one had an issue. And that makes me feel bad because they were probably nicer to you than I was, and I'm the one dating you.""

So that was pretty nice to hear and I feel more okay now. 

Aaaaand that's basically it. Hopefully this is the last argument we have about this topic and we can move on now. 

TLDR; we talked it out and we're both okay now.

7,"PSA: Being attracted to masculine guys isn't an attack on the gay community


What gets you hard isn't political, why is that so crazy to understand

I'm not talking about the guys who are assholes to fem guys. (Or vice versa). But it's not about politics, and campaigning or writing articles about this isn't going to change people's attractions"
8,"My mother's boyfriend offered me 40k to only date women


He's made the offer before but I thought he was joking, but now it's serious. 


He is my mother's high school sweetheart and they are really good together. He's been going through some rough stuff with his ex wife but he is a pretty nice guy. 


My mother was never good with me coming out (I'm bi) but she's been getting better about it. She has been living with him for the last year and she's about to buy a house. The plan was for them to move in together but he just told her the other night he's not moving with her. 


Now he is offering me $40,000 to only date women. He has a contract written up and everything. I flat out refused him. Now he doesn't understand why I'm pissed and is saying he's not moving in with my mother because the family doesn't like him. 


Other than this he has always been a good guy and he's the one that talked my mother into apologizing to me after her little break down when I came out. 



Just venting..."
9,"I've been lying to my BF for months about something really stupid. Now I'm about to get caught and I'm scared he'll dump me for it


[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6gwqy8/update_ive_been_lying_to_my_bf_for_months_about/?st=J3V6MEE4&amp;sh=0318be56)

So I met my bf on Grindr almost a year ago. I didn't have my age on my profile. But in my bf's description thingy it said ""21+ only"". Well I was only 20 at the time. 

We started messaging each other and I asked about his age requirement. He said it was because he's 26 and not interested in dating someone too much younger. He said ideally he would want someone his own age. 

He also said he likes to go to bars and stuff and doesn't want to have to deal with the hassle of dating someone who can't get in. 

So I ended up saying I was 22. I have a really good fake ID that I use, so my bf never figured out my age. 

Okay. Fast forward. 

Now my bf is 27 and studying for the Bar. (He just graduated law school). 

Meanwhile, my 21st birthday is coming up in a few days. And all of my friends are planning this big celebration since it's a milestone. 

Now the obvious solution would be to tell my friends to cancel the whole thing. But I just feel like eventually my bf is going to find out the truth?

And I'm really scared because, I mean, he's going to be a lawyer and he's a really ethical person. And I've technically been breaking laws and all of that and I've also been lying. 

I talked to my friend about this and he thinks it's no big deal bc everyone has used a fake id and I should just tell my bf. 

But I feel nervous still? I feel like he's gonna be pissed that I've been lying this whole time or think I'm crazy or something. 

And what if he doesn't wanna date someone 6 years younger? He already calls me a ""baby"" even though he thinks I'm turning 23 instead of 21...

Anyway I know I messed up. So I'm wondering what I should do now. Would you all dump someone over this? Or just let it go? And how should I bring it up if at all?
