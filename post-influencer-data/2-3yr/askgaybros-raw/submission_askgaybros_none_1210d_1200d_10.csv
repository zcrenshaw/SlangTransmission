0,"I'm not your freaking fetish.


TLDR: If someone is different from you, treat them like a human being.

I'm a black dude, I'm 5""10, and I'm 160 pounds. Lifting weights since 7th grade for track and field has helped make me muscular. (Plus being on the shorter side.) Life isn't too bad I guess.

But one of the problems I have now is being some ignorant person's fetish. ""Oh, look at that muscular black guy! Does he have a big dick? Is he a thug? Has he ever ROBBED anybody?""

I mean some of y'all might think that it's a compliment and it should feel better than being called ugly cause you're black or having racist slurs thrown at you because you're black, but that's not it AT ALL. It actually is just as bad, if not worse.

It's bad when people don't see you as someone who could be friendship or relationship material and they just see you as a ""cool black guy"" that they wanna hang out with, smoke weed with, and then suck ""his big black dick."" And does dating other black guys work either? No, because the majority of them are obsessed with white guys.

One of my friends is Chinese and I've asked her if she's dealt with it. She has. Once she dating a guy that said that he loved ""orientals"" and had tons of knockoff Chinese furniture that he kept all around his house. Everyday he would ask her to make a new ""exotic, Asian dish.""

He was a guy from Britain. And yes, people like that do exist.

So, to end my rant I guess I'll just say this. I know a lot of y'all like dating people that are the same race as you, but if you ever do date some that's a different race, please treat them like an actual person. Don't do that bullshit where you call them exotic and ask them ignorant questions and make them only feel like your dirty secret. Thanks

EDIT: I wanna clear up what I meant. I don't mean that people can't have a type. I don't have the right to tell people that lol. 

If someone likes black guys woohoo that's great. Just don't be ignorant and say stereotypical things that you think are compliments, but aren't."
1,"Get consent


I can't believe I have to post this, but a post earlier today which is now deleted caused me to write this fun nugget:

&gt; Congrats throw away account! You've just committed sexual molestation! Your friend didn't give you any sort of consent to sexualize or touch him as he was sleeping! But don't worry it will only haunt you for the rest of your days and it only cost you the trust and friendship of your friend!

Holy fucking shit. If you think your friend is gay, talk to them. If your friend is touching you in ways that make you comfortable/horny/uncomfortable or whatever talk to them. 

DO NOT try and fool around with them while they're sleeping. Do not try and get them drunk and fool around with them. 

Get fucking consent before you touch them sexually. If you do not, you're molesting them. It doesn't matter if they like it or if they don't, ask them first. 

Edit: Also if you're in the middle of the act, and they say stop. YOU FUCKING STOP. People can revoke consent at any time. "
2,"Popping the question Wednesday!


Tried to post this on gaybros but got booted for low karma. Well la-de-freakin-da.


Long time lurker here. Love this sub but I've never had anything to contribute until now. Me and my BF have been together for three years and a couple of months. We've never discussed marriage very much, even when it became legal. 



Since our three year anniversary I've been doing a lot of reflecting and I've been a goddamn fool. I've always looked at marriage as unnecessary. Neither of us wants kids, has money or anything of value to pass on, or plans on dying anytime soon. And we both have jobs with benefits. I wasn't against it I just didn't see it as benefiting us in any way.
Yeah, fuck me. 



I'm also the partner kinda still in the closet. I've never raised the gay flag but everyone pretty much knows. We've lived together for two years so when we are around my family (daily) and they treat us as a couple even though I've never treated him as anything other than a friend in front of them.



I realize I put this relationship on autopilot and it makes me sick. He is my entire world but I've been taking him for granted and just enjoying the ride. As for him he seems overjoyed. He told me that he's thought of marriage often but assumed the reason I never brought it up was that I hadn't planned on spending my life with him (even though I've told him that many times). Yeah, fuck me jesus. I want to show him and everyone else that I love him enough to give him my life.



I brought it up with him last week. I told him I was dedicated to spending my life with him and that i intended to ask him to marry. I told him to be ready with his decision but not to tell me now. But he can't help himself and he's been dropping hints like crazy.



I asked him for a date on Wednesday at 5:30. We will be meeting at the exact time and place and weekday and, I hope (haven't asked the manager yet) the same Fatz table. This time I won't be too shy to ask him to come home with me. I could have lost him that night before i ever knew him. Fuck me again. 



When we get home there will be flowers and champagne and a marriage proposal waiting. Neither of us enjoy public spectacles and we both know we will probably cry.




I have a ring. Simple little tungsten thing until we can ring shop. About a year ago he gave me a ring engraved with the line from Casper ""Can I keep you?"". Since there is really no answer in the movie this ring says ""Please keep me, (BFs name)"".



It won't a perfect or over the top proposal but it will be honest and true. Hopefully just like our future."
3,"came out to my dad at 45


So I finally did it today, told my dad I was gay at age 45. I accepted the fact at 16.

Why did I wait 29 years? Well.. after telling my father on the phone, he replied with ""*sigh* ... you're going to Hell"" and hung up. I don't know how long it will be before I speak to him again, if ever. He is 80 in poor health and still smokes. Being realistic he has until 83 max.

 He may be a homophobe but he's still my dad, this is really hard. If I had told him as a teenager / young adult he probably would have beat me up and thrown me out of the house as soon as he legally could have, coming from murica bible belt central &amp; a household where church was a twice or thrice-a-week occasion. 

My mom died a few years ago and had the same attitude towards basically anybody who wasn't white, ""christian"", and straight. I never told her because of the possibility of her going batshit, for all of his faults my dad is a lot more chill in his bigotry if that makes any sense. 

Luckily I live very far away from the hateful place where I grew up, and have an amazing boyfriend and a network of great acquaintances in personal and professional life. I just can't get over how I may not see my dad until he's dead."
4,"Cute ""straight friend"" story in r/relationships that I thought you'd appreciate.


Did any of you see this post today in /r/relationships? I thought some in this sub would appreciate it. 

In the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iowpi/me_22m_with_my_roommate_of_1_year_23m_im_worried/) a couple weeks ago, the author was worried because he'd started having a negative reaction whenever his gay roommate had a guy over, feeling angry and disgusted. He was afraid he was becoming homophobic against his will.

And in [today's update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kz72i/update_me_22m_with_my_roommate_of_1_year_23m_im/), he'd figured out, after a talk with his sister and lots of introspection, that it was jealousy, not homophobia. ""Plot twist: it turns out I don't have any problem with Alex kissing guys if it's me he's kissing."""
5,"Porn where the guys look happy?


So weird question: it seems to me that gay porn is largely catering to semi straight guys who want to be dominated and ""hurt"" in the actual act of penetration - hence a lot of the language (""hunk destroys twink "", etc.) Nothing wrong with that, but it's not my thing. 

I was wondering if anyone has examples / sources of gay porn with a lighter touch, where it looks like the guys are actually having fun with each other?

To be totally honest, my desire for this has brought me to furry stuff, since the animators there are often very good at portraying gay sex as fun and blissful and graceful and even kind of cute and innocent (which is how it makes me feel), rather than painful and  forced. I want that, but in real porn. "
