"How to fix a laptop that won't boot in under a minute


Last year, Help Desk got a call from a user complaining that the laptop we issued him would not read DVDs.  He was one of those ""I'm a very busy and a very important man, and I don't have time to follow your troubleshooting steps over the phone.  Just fix it, dammit."" kinda guys, so he said he would get someone to drop off the laptop at our office and pick up a loaner.

&amp;nbsp;

We received the laptop a couple days later, there was a note attached saying that now it wasn't even booting into Windows anymore.  Sure enough, he was right - it didn't even attempt to load Windows, and instead we were greeted by the ""Non-system disk or disk error"" message.  It sounded and looked like the PC was trying to boot from the DVD drive instead of the HDD.

&amp;nbsp;

We opened the disk tray, and saw the culprit.  There was a DVD in there, all right - but it was placed upside down.

&amp;nbsp;

We flipped the disc over. 

&amp;nbsp;

He was trying to watch ""Dumb and Dumber""."
"HALP! I can't email donotreply!


**Me:** Service Desk

**Caller:** You need to help me right now!

**Me:**...

**Caller:** *HELLO!*

**Me:** Help you with what please... you need to explain your issue

**Caller:** EVERY TIME I EMAIL SOMEONE FROM &lt;EXTERNAL COMPANY&gt; I GET A MESSAGE TELLING ME TO NOT REPLY. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? PLEASE FIX THIS!

**Me:** Well if this is an external company I suspect there's not much we can do. May I remotely connect and take a look?

**Caller:** Whatever just fix it

... connected remotely ...

**Me:** Okay please show me the messages that you've sent and received...

... caller brings up her sent box with about 50 messages sent to donotreply@&lt;external company&gt;.com and then her inbox with about 50 automatic replies saying she has contacted an unmonitored inbox ...

**Caller:** SEE! YOU NEED TO GET THIS RESOLVED ASAP *RIGHT NOW*!

... at this point I'm rapidly exceeding my BS tolerance ....

**Me:** You're sending emails to a do not reply address. This is why it's happening. As you can see from the multiple emails they've sent back to you - you should be using customerservice@&lt;external company&gt;.com *NOT* donotreply@&lt;external company&gt;.com

**Caller:** DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? STOP AVOIDING THE ISSUE!

**Me:** Can you see my mouse?

**Caller:** *YES!*

**Me:** Can you see *this* address in the to field?

**Caller:** *sigh* *YES!*

**Me:** What does it say?

**Caller:** donotrep...

**Caller:** oh

**Caller:** *click*

Yes, goodbye caller - you have a *fantastic* day now!"
