"TIFU by ignoring testicle pain


So this happened a few days ago.  Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had just gotten home from work (I work from 9-3) and I decided to take a nap for a few hours before I had to make dinner.  As I was starting to fall asleep I rolled over and then felt a weird pain in my left testicle.  It didn't feel like it had been hit, but rather like it was being squeezed.  I assumed I was laying on it or something and rolled again, but the pain stayed.  I wanted nothing more than to sleep and I knew if I had laid on it the pain wouldn't just go away instantly, so I tried my best to ignore it and managed to fall asleep.  This would turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life.

I woke up 2 hours later and I felt like my dick and I felt a pain greater than anything that I've ever felt.  My left testicle felt like it had been attacked by a cobra, and was having it's life slowly squeezed from it.  I knew right then something was wrong, I've been hit in the balls before, but this is something else.  I reached down to feel it and the whole thing just felt weird. My parents weren't home (I'm 17) and there was no way I'd be able to drive myself to the hospital, so I had to call my neighbor who rushed me there.  The pain was just getting greater as time passed to the point where I threw up out her car window at one point.

The first thing they did when I got there was give me some morphine.  This helped me a little, and I was able to stay still long enough for them to do an ultrasound.  While they were comparing my balls, the doctor told me that I was most likely dealing with testicular torsion.  For those of you who have only heard of that from Cards Against Humanity but have no idea what it actually is, basically it's when the spermatic cord twists, and cuts off the blood flow to the testicle.  If it isn't treated soon enough, the testicle could die and have to be amputated.  The doctor gave me a lot of crap for going back to sleep instead of taking the pain seriously, because I was really cutting it close time wise and they weren't completely sure if they were going to be able to save it.

I learned that the way to fix it would be to perform a surgery where they cut open the scrotum and manually untwist the cord.  They put me under, and I went to sleep praying that they would be able to save my testicle.

They couldn't.

Today's the first time I haven't been heavily medicated since the surgery, and I want to use this TIFU as a PSA.  If you think something might be wrong with your balls, TREAT IT LIKE IT'S SERIOUS.  I already have a low sperm count, and the doctor told me it's very unlikely that I'll be able to have kids now that I can only produce half as much.  Please guys, take care of your testicles.

TL;DR: Decided sleep was more important than my balls, lost half of the Juice Crew

Edit:  Holy shit gold!  Thanks for the support everyone.

Edit 2:  Anyone wondering how I know I have a low sperm count I did a test last year.  There's a history of infertility in my family and I took a test to know if having kids would be a possibility somewhere down the line"
"TIFU by flicking my hair


So this morning I jumped in the shower and decided to wash my hair. I have very long and curly hair that reaches midway down my back. However, once its wet the curls straighten out and my hair almost reaches my bum. 

So hair is wet, shampooing done and I just need to rinse. I tip my head back and flip my hair over my shoulder ala shampoo adverts everywhere. And feel something brush against the top of my bum. Being the mature and logical gal I am, I came to the one and only possible conclusion. 

Spider

With a scream a howler monkey would be proud of, boobs flying and looking like some sort of demented mermaid, I attempted to flee the shower stall. And promptly acquired a new skill; the ability to do the splits.  

This in itself was a spectacular feat of physics as there isn't actually enough room in my bathroom for a toddler to do the splits, never-mind a 5'9"" half drowned rat. As a result, when my leading foot came into contact with the toilet pedestal my body was launched back along the floor towards the shower. This  left me wedged between the toilet and the shower tray.

Where I was abruptly bitch-slapped by the shower door.

One trip to A&amp;E later and I have a sprained ankle, a fractured ankle, two broken toes, a beautiful rainbow of bruises in some interesting places and a partridge in a pear tree.

**TL, DR: Upon learning that my hair now reaches my bum I; preformed gymnastics worthy of Rio, made the laws of physics my bitch and took a guided tour of the local hospital.**  

**UPDATE:** So because I’m a special little unicorn my broken toes and fractured ankle are on opposite feet therefore I’m now rockin a bitchin new wheelchair (well not new, it’s the NHS and its Scotland). Also my flat is upstairs so it might as well be on Everest, so I’m at my parents bungalow until my sprain is well enough for me to find another way to fuck it up.

I’ve had the wheelchair for about 6hrs now and have bounced it off every door frame in the house and scuffed two of the walls (don’t tell my mother). After about 2hrs of me bouncing around like a ping pong ball my mum got the shits with me and told me to go and annoy my younger brother, who is playing xbox in the living room. So after letting him have a go on the chair and basically pissing about, he says 3 little words that have resulted in this update.
 
“Do a wheelie”

Fucking challenge accepted. I give it a go and end up tipping the chair backwards, arse over tits (which I’m sure would, again, be flying if they hadn’t been secured in a locked and upright position) and cracking my head on the fireplace. I’m now on my back doing the world’s worst impression of an upside down turtle with a cast and now a head wound. My 19yr old, apparently adult brother is trying to crawl to the bathroom before pisses himself laughing.

So now I’m back in A&amp;E waiting to get glued back together.

**TL, DR: Was challenged to a wheelchair wheelie which resulted in; me becoming gravity's bitch again, a grown man almost wetting himself and a second guided tour of A&amp;E.**  

UPDATE 2: No I haven’t injured myself again. So after seeing the same Dr I saw during my first trip in, I thankfully don’t have a skull fracture or concussion. I’ve just split the skin which was fixed with glue and tape because apparently medical and art supplies are the same thing. I’m also back in the wheelchair as the very wise Dr felt “crutches would just be asking for it”. He’s not wrong I full admit I would have attempted to swing from them and/or use them as pirate swords.  Though most likely both.

So I thought I’d check Reddit on the way home and holy shit. I was not expecting this response!! I just thought a few people would stop to point and laugh at the clumsy twat and move on. I caught wee bro before he left for work and showed him, he told me “you need to tell them the freezer story, that was just fucking insane”. So after I’ve caught some sleep, read all the comments etc, I may write that one up if anyone is interested.  So to all of you who took the time to read this and those of you who commented thank you.

Also, thank you to the person who gilded this I have no idea what that means but I’m fucking excited about it. As soon as I figure out how to figure out who did it your name will be up here in shiny lights, or black and white at least.    

EDIT: I've been given two reddit gold? I didn't know you could have more than one. So I'd like to thank /u/i_pk_pjers_i for one Reddit Gold and I'm still trying to figure out who my second came from. Also I promise to write up my escapade with the freezer once I've had some sleep.

EDIT 2: Holy shit batman, I can not believe the response this has gotten. Seriously people thank you, I've read through a good majority of your comments and some have made me peeing myself. I'm not sure if I'll be able to respond to everyone but I will try. However, before I do, I just have to thank /u/mariusbalaban and /u/HaikuSorrow as well as two others who are currently anonymous for the reddit golds. 

Also for those who are interested I'll be posting my freezer story as soon as I finish this edit.

"TIFU by accidentally waterboarding myself.


So this fuck-up took place last week, at my nephew's 6th birthday party. 

We were having this party at my parents house by the lake, and we have this floating divingboard thing like 10-15 meters out from the 'beach'. So people were swimming, diving, generally just having a blast.

My nephew's favorite thing is Spiderman, he fucking loves Spiderman. So I dressed up in a Spiderman-looking morphsuit. You know the green tight suit 'hilarious' guys wear, yeah, that kind.

So I suited up, and after a while I decided to go swimming in said suit. I swam out to the floating divingboard, climbed up and got ready to jump. 

Dived into the lake, swam 3-4meters underwater, then resurfaced. When I came up for air, I quickly realized that the morph suit drastically looses its ability to let air through the breathing points when it gets wet. The thing is, the morph suit is really hard to take of, it unzips at the back of your head, which is a tricky spot to reach when you're basically drowning. So I tried to remove it by taking my hands behind my head, which resulted in me sinking into the water. I repeated this process of going up trying to breathe, and sinking from trying to take of the morph suit. 

Eventually I had to be rescued by my older brother. 


**TLDR: Dived into a lake with a morphsuit on, couldn't breathe, had to be rescued by my older brother.**

**EDIT: Rip inbox, thanks to everyone telling me how fucking stupid I am. I wholeheartedly agree..**

**EDIT 2: I appreciate every condecending message trying to teach me about waterboarding, and how they wished I had died.**

**EDIT 3: YES, I know this wasn't a case of Guantanamo Bay waterboarding. YES, I know I wouldn't last two seconds with real waterboarding. YES, I'm clearly a pussy and you would destroy me. Get the fuck out of here with your guerrilla warfare training.**

**EDIT 4: I'm aware that waterboarding is a highly sensitive/touchy subject, and at no point did I try to make fun of waterboarding as it some of the worst shit you can do to a person. I'm not trying to make jokes,  this is /r/tifu  not fucking /r/funny. Realise that.**"
"TIFU by destroying a friendship in a most spectacular fashion.


Good god. I can't believe I'm actually about to type this out. This is literally the worst thing I've ever done and it was completely on accident.  It's gonna be a long one so buckle the fuck up.   
  
Some quick context: I'm in my mid-30s and so are the other people in this story. Making friends outside of work in your 30s isn't impossible, but it's very strange and uncomfortable and most dudes avoid it. The gentleman that this story revolves around is one of the very few real friends I've organically made in this stage of my life. I've changed the names of everyone involved.   
  
Alright. Here we go.   
  
Last week I gave my buddy Craig a ride home from work since we work in the same building and got off at the same time. He wanted to stop by the bar that both his wife and our friend Nate work at. It's right next to their house. Nate and I had become real friends about a year ago after him and my wife had a heated debate about Star Wars Battlefront. We've been BFFs since. Anyway, Nates's bartending and we sit down and shoot the shit for a few.   
Now Nate had just moved into a new apartment right down the street. Apparently he had noticed his hot water heater leaking before he went to work and was concerned since he was working an evening into graveyard double. Because Nate is a good person and trusts Craig and I, he asked if we could go check on it for him to ease his mind. We say sure, take his key, and walk down the street to his apartment.   
Once inside, my propensity for harmless mischief overtakes me.   
""This place is nice but could really use a few dicks"", I say to Craig as I whip out my Sharpee. Craig rightly suggests that instead of permanently applying ink to both personal and rented property, I should instead draw dicks on tiny pieces of paper and hide them around the apartment. I agree that is much better.  
I begin looking through Nate's drawers for Post-Its or something similar but found nothing. He's a single dude in his 30s living alone in a one bedroom apartment that he moved into 6 days ago. There's just not accumulated junk around like I'm used to.   
In the tiny chunk of counter next to his stove, however, there's a smallish yellow piece of paper that looks like a carbon copy of a receipt with some little orange tabs stuck to it. Next to it is the ring of a milk cap and a crumpled Del Taco receipt and I remember realizing there wasn't a trash can and chuckling to myself about how if I didn't have my wife to literally keep me alive, I too would have forgotten to buy a trash can when moving in somewhere and would just deal with it rather than rushing out and buying one.  
So I take this yellow piece of paper and start tearing off tiny chunks (maybe an inch by half an inch) and begin drawing dicks on them. Craig and I are giggling in a way that only grown-ass men doing something incredibly childish do - manically and incessantly. Each dick is funnier and veinier than the one that preceded it and the hiding spots around his apartment become more and more obscure. We hid a dick between his couch cushions. We taped a dick on the underside of his kitchen cabinet. We put a dick inside his shaving kit. We put a dick inside a shaker of oregano so that someday while he's cooking spaghetti and the oregano isn't coming out the way it should, he'll unscrew the lid and find a tiny dick staring back at him. Our goal was to make sure he'd be finding these for months, if not years and smile whilst cursing our names.   
After about 20 dicks, I got sick of drawing them and started writing little inspirational messages like ""Jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" and ""Vaccines cause autism - wake up sheeple"". As a double whammy, we taped one behind his shower head that has a drawing of a dick ejaculating but the puddle of semen says ""Bush did 9/11"".  
It was a masterpiece of whimsical fuckery and we laughed all the way back to the bar.   
Upon our return, we told him of the gifts we had bestowed upon him and we laughed and laughed and laughed. Nate laughed too but in a ""you guys are dicks and I can't believe you're my friends"" kinda way.   
I've been drying out to curb what was becoming a pattern of self-medicating problem drinking so I didn't really want to stick around the bar for too long. I decided to take off and went home and fell asleep still quietly giggling to myself about the hilarity of the thing that we'd done. Nate had been pretty depressed for the last 6 months or so and I loved that for the next year or more, he'd be finding little love notes from Craig and I to remind him he's not alone. It was a gift that would keep on giving.   
   
Okay. Here's the part that's really, really hard to type.  
  
The next morning around 11am, I get a series of texts from Craig, which is odd because he's never awake before 2pm. He tells me that we've fucked up and we've fucked up big time.   
  
Turns out that carbon copy receipt I tore up wasn't just a carbon copy receipt. Nope, it wasn't that at all.  
On the back of it, which I never bothered to look at, was a goofy love letter from Nate's girlfriend.  
Nate's girlfriend - who was hit by a drunk driver on the freeway and killed 6 months ago.  
  
I walked into a man's home, picked up one of the last physical reminders of his dead girlfriend, ripped it into 30 pieces, drew dicks on those pieces, and hid them all over his house for him to find for the next year.   
  
If I had spent a month in seclusion manically plotting how to hurt Nate in the worst way possible, I could have never come up with something so utterly fucked up. It was like a precisely focused laser beam of flamboyant disrespect.   
 
Of course I immediately texted him as I knew there was no way he'd accept a call from me. I sincerely apologized while offering no excuses and accepting full responsibility, imploring him to not blame Craig as it wasn't his idea. I didn't want their friendship to be ruined as well; plus Craig's wife works with Nate every day and she is the sweetest person ever and I couldn't deal with him lumping her in on this and ruining a work relationship as well. At the end of the day, it really was 100% my fault and those two awesome people shouldn't suffer for my horrible mistake.   
  
As I'm sure you guessed, Nate has never responded to my texts and that's to be expected. I'm sure he has written me off forever as the worst person ever and he's not wrong. I've never done something so unforgivably awful to another person in my entire life and it will haunt me to the grave, I'm sure. I haven't slept for more than 2 hours a night in the past week and when I do, I dream that Nate has either forgiven me or revealed that it was a joke and it really was just an old carbon copy receipt. Every morning I wake up relieved and then reality sets in and I hate myself a little bit more.   
  
What I did was completely unforgivable and I don't expect him to ever forgive me. I hope he does someday though. Until then, the image of him finally getting home at 7am with a begrudging grin knowing the goofiness that awaits him inside and instead finding his momento torn asunder and suddenly and horrifically putting the pieces together while openly weeping alone in the tiny kitchen of a 400 sq ft apartment will haunt me for the rest of my natural life. I did that to a person and I did it trying to be funny. Nothing's been funny to me since. 

I haven't really told anyone about this so thanks for reading.

"TIFU by faking appendicitis and getting my Appendix removed.


Back in 1985 I had just returned from the US as an AFS student. After school was out for the summer, I had no real plans, and had not a lot of money. I found this interesting advert in a newspaper for a youth camp in DDR in East-Berlin. It said, work 2 weeks of solidarity work with students and have one week of bathing vacation by the Baltic Sea, for a small sum of about $100. 

It was organized by the Friendship organization Norway-DDR. I got excited and wanted to see the other side of the iron curtain, since I had just spent one year in USA. It never hurt to see the world, and DDR was not a typical tourists place one could say. I signed up. We were traveling by train, and I was the only boy in a group of 10 people. It was me, and 9 girls. We also had an adult chaperone who was a teacher at a high school and in his 50s. 

The whole trip was surreal, and I could write a book about the whole experience. We were greeted by Youth Pioneers in blue uniforms and a marching band. Since we were only 11 people and not the 100 they had hoped for, the whole thing was rather embarrassing and cringe worthy. They set us up in a camp with military style tents, and I notice that most of the other participants in this ""solidarity camp"" were female.  One huge tent for showering and it was unisex to my shy surprise. The idea of the camp was that students filled the workers jobs so they could have a vacation. The work consisted in digging down a cable along the railroad tracks outside Potsdam. We were driven in huge military style trucks every morning, the kind they transport troops in. The third day, we had wine and a little party with some of the girls in the neighboring tents. I was 17 at the time and had only tried alcohol once before. I drank Sekt, a type of bubbly wine. A lot. 

The next day, I woke up to my second hangover ever. It was awful. We drove the trucks, I got sick, and puked in the truck, out of the truck and just everywhere. Not wanting to look like I could not handle alcohol, I said I had a stomach pain when we got to the work place. I got to lay down, and I continued to fake the pain. Although I must admit I was feeling pretty bad and sick, but had no pain. After an hour, one of the translators came over to me and said they were going to take me to a doctor. He worked for STASI, I later found out. Since we were guests of the DDR government, they wanted to show that they took good care of their guests. We drove about half an hour to the doctors office. The female doctors ( not nurses) with strange white hats, lead me in to a bed behind some screens and gave me a rectal thermometer. 

They left me and  said they would check on me in a few minutes. Not wanting to disappoint them, I put the thermometer on a lamp, and it soon showed I had a low fever.  They came back and pressed on my stomach and I politely screamed. They then decided to move me to a hospital by ambulance. The same procedures were done there, but I left the thermometer to long on the lamp, and now it showed me having a high fever. Things went fast from there. Before I could protest, my German was not very good, I was given pre surgery medication and some strong pain medication into my arm. I was put under before I could tell them I was lying. When I woke up, I screamed "" Ich hat kein schmerz"" ( I had no pain) and discovered they had removed my appendix. 

The next 4 days I stayed at the hospital was awful. I got something called Bitter Wasser I think, to get my bowls moving. I got sent home on a plane, and they never admitted that my appendix was not infected. I did not either. So now I have a scar that reminds me that I should never ever lie about serious medical conditions, but on the other hand, I never had to fear Appendicitis if I took a long hike in the mountains... I was young and stupid. 

TL;DR  I faked stomach pain to cover over the fact I was hungover and got my appendix removed.

Edit a bit for spelling. First post, so sorry if I do it wrong. 

I promised some photos. Will not post identifiable pix of ppl, but here are some B/W pictures I took at the camp

Oh, and I never said I did not have sex... BTW, I never put the thermometer in my ass after heating it. I never dreamed that they were going to operate. I was still hungover and did clearly not think straight.

"TIFU and tested the temperature of candy with my finger.


When I was fifteen, I made the brilliant decision to make my own caramel candies. Having had no candy making experience whatsoever, I told myself ""how hard can it be?""

I gathered my sugar, milk, water, and got to cooking. Now I personally prefer my sauces on the thicker side, so I significantly diminished the amounts of milk and water called for. After maybe twenty minutes I have not caramel, but a thick brown gunk in the pot. It looks more polyjuice potion than caramel. And worst of all, it's not visibly cooking. It's just sorta sitting there.

Being a stupid, stupid teenager, I take this as a sign that mixture is cold. I stick a spoon in and pull it out. The stuff is thicker than syrup, but still somewhat fluid. I decide to test the temperature the easy way.

FU 1. I drizzled a large clump of the goop onto my finger.

Here's a fun fact: caramelized sugar can reach temperatures of up to 338°F. For you normal people, that's 170°C. (Thanks for the correction, chefs!)

The sugar is that special kind of hot. So hot that it feels blistering cold, and my body immediately rejects it. I lost the ability to scream, to think rationally. All I can focus on is the hell that's unfolding on my finger. I clawed at the goop violently and yanked.

Somewhere between the yanking and the rip, I felt a sort of hardness. I assumed this was a chunk of solidified sugar, and it was this chunk I ripped at.

FU 2. It wasn't a piece of hard sugar. It was my fingernail.

I can honestly say I've known pain so intense I vomited. This was that pain. I spin around to the sink and after a few moments, empty what remains of my lunch. Then, I think to myself ""some water would sure help my finger!""

Wrong. Half my nail is gone, meaning my nerves are exposed. Meaning that touching even lukewarm water is like shoving my finger into a damn newborn star.

For maybe a second, I blacked out. Long enough to fall, but short enough that I awoke before hitting the ground.

About this time, my sanity kicks in. My finger needs medical attention. So I turn off the water, the stove, and head to the hospital which luckily is only five minutes away.

Long story short, I got taken care of (thank scientists for morphine) and spent the next few days in haze of pain meds. I got second degree burns on my finger, and permanent nerve damage to my finger.

I learned my lesson. I haven't tried to make carmel to this day.

TL;dr I put hot caramel on my finger and got burned for it. In the throes of agony, I ripped off half of my own nail.

Edit: Whoa! Didn't expect this to be so well received. Thank you all! I've gotten a few questions so here are the answers. 

-My parents were not present. My dad was in another state, and my mom working. The hospital called her shortly after I was in, and she came right over. 

-Yup, the pot had to be thrown away. RIP my favorite boiling pot. 

-My skin and nail grew back. I've lost most feeling in the finger, though. 

-No idea why it's a question, but I'm a girl."
"TIFU by asking my wife for a blow job...

"TIFU - Preparing for the wife!


So today I fucked up.  Tomorrow is our 10-year Anniversary night.  We've dumped the kids off at Mom's and tomorrow we're heading back to England for a week.  She's British, wants to spend a week in England.  Cool. 

The wife has meticulously womanscaped her area for me I know, because that's the only time she takes 2 hour long showers.  So I think to myself... well.. Maybe I'll return the favor.

So I sneak out to the hell that is Walmart to surprise her by doing some serious manscaping.  I keep the area nice, but I'm gunna go full retard and napalm the area.  I spend ten minutes awkwardly standing in the aisle looking at the hundreds of options for waxes, hair removal cream, etc.  I end up going with Nair for sensitive areas.  I figure that's the best choice.

So I get home and carefully read the directions.  Apply liberally to the area, wait ten minutes and wipe with a towel, the hair should go with it.  I ignore the warning about applying directly to genitals because I'm a man.  Hear me fucking roar.

So I apply this cream thick.  Real thick, everywhere.  I wait the ten minutes and wipe it off, nothing happens.  Fuck.  This didn't work.  So I try again, liberally apply the rest of the bottle back onto the area, put my boxers on to hide what I'm doing from the wife; it's still a surprise... and sit on the couch and fire up some Youtube.  I figure I'll wait 15 minutes this time and try again.

Nope. 

I wake up 5 hours later.  My junk is numb, very numb.  I stand up slowly and I can feel cracking, I can feel things falling down my pants leg.  As I slowly penguin over to the bathroom, a trail of crusted pieces of Nair falling to the floor behind me, I gently pull my boxers away from the skin, and pieces of what looks like skin are coming with it.  This isn't good.  The nair has dried and has adhered to my skin.  

I run a cold bath and jump in, letting the water re-hydrate the nair so that I can gently wipe it off.  Slowly the water is turning red, I realize, red with blood.  This is where the panic sets in.  As I painstakingly remove the nair, feeling starts returning.  My testicles are on fire.   I begin to sob like a bitch.  I slowly make my way out of the bathroom, saddle-walking like you've never seen, searching for something to sooth the hellfire that is between my legs.

Baby oil.  That will do the trick, I think.  You put baby oil on babies to keep their skin nice, surely that will sooth my hot balls of fire.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

I've never cried so hard in my life, it was as if cthulu had fisted my frank and beans with a flaming iron bar.  Apparently you don't put oil on burns.

I now have a severe chemical burn on my junk, it's blistering, and I have to be on a plane for a 16 hour flight in a few hours for a very sexless anniversary vacation.

Worst part?  Most of the hair was still there, somehow.  I don't understand it.  As I said previously, I set out on a mission to go full retard and napalm the shrubbery and all I managed to achieve was to scorch the earth.

tl;dr Fell asleep with Nair on my balls.  Then soothed it with baby oil.  Blistered testicles suck, day before 10 year anniversary.

*****************************UPDATE****************************************

After having sat in the tub for a few hours I did heed your advice and head to the ER after little blisters started forming.  And I'd ran out of ice in the house to sooth the area.

And my whiskey bottle was empty.

The pain had mostly subsided by the time I'd gotten to the ER.  Well, I lie.  It still fucking hurt, but it was nothing like the hellfire I'd felt the moment I decided applying baby oil to a burn would be a wise idea.

Hobbling into to ER they were looking at me funny, demanding I sit down in a wheelchair.  The last thing I wanted to do was sit, can't spread my legs far enough apart sitting down in a damn wheel chair, needless to say skin-to-skin contact was the worst, I needed to let my jewels breath.

I did ask to speak to a male nurse; they all assumed by the way I was walking I'd broken my tail bone I think.  It took a while for them to find a guy for me to talk to, for whatever reason I just wanted to talk to a dude about my medical emergency.  The guy couldn't keep a straight face, and thought I was joking.

So after an excruciating two-hour wait in the ER I finally got a room and got to see the doctor.  They had me take another shower and sponged the area clean.  I've never been uh; cleaned before.  By someone else.  I'm sure they were just trying to ensure that I'd removed all the cream, but by that point between the wife and I, I'm fairly confident we'd gotten it with the 3 hours I'd spent in the tub. Not the most pleasant experience.

Showing me how to gauze the area was probably the worst experience, though.  It seems like they were trying to figure it out themselves.  It took them a few tries before they had the technique figured out, and as I stated previously; all of this still hadn't removed all of the fucking hair.  I can say that most of it is gone now, the amount of times they taped gauze down and then decided it didn't look right and peeled the tape away.  I should have just waxed, that's how most of it seemingly came off anyway.  Not fun.

Long story short, I've got a second degree burn.  They've given me a big tub of some cream called silver sulfadiazine to apply to the area during bandage changes and a prescription for antibiotics.  It should heal up in a few weeks with no permanent damage.

On another note, American Airlines was willing to adjust our flights due to the circumstances.  I'm not looking forward to being crammed into an airplane tomorrow.

tl;dr went to ER, had bad experience."
"TIFU by going to the emergency room.


So, after reading [this fuck up](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4um48z/tifu_by_faking_appendicitis_and_getting_my/) I knew I had to post mine. 

Back in March, I woke up on a beautiful Saturday morning to a terrible stomach ache. After a couple of hours, it was almost unbearable. I called the hospital and they told me since the pain seemed like appendicitis, I should treat it as an emergency and come in, so I did. 

I shouldn't have.

After being poked with IV's, having several blood tests done, a CT scan, and the rest of my day being spent in the hospital, the doctor came in with the results.

I had to poop. That was all. I've received over $7,000 in hospital bills because I had to take a shit. I could have easily bought a cheap over the counter medicine. I don't think I'm ever going to the hospital again.

TL;DR: Went to the hospital thinking I had appendicitis, just had to take a shit. I'm still getting hospital bills. "
"TIFU by shutting a door.


I was just fitting a door. I trimmed the door to size then chiselled out all the hinge rebates and fitted them, it swung really nicely and fitted perfectly.

So I moved on the the latch. Drilled a nice deep hole for it without going off line, chiselled out for the faceplate and screwed it all together.

Then I swung the door shut again to test it. Click! Perfect. All going well.

Now open the door again ready to put the knobs on. Oh.

How the hell do I get the latch to release when not only are there no knobs yet, there isn't even a hole in the door to get at the latch mechanism...

I think I'll just stay here for a while.

"TIFU by being naive after a car accident


Got hit by someone on the way to church today. Got out, and immediately APOLOGIZED for the accident taking place. He takes advantage of it, tries to convince me it was my fault, and almost gets me to pay for paint remover for him, even though my car had *far worse damage. I leave, and only afterwards do I learn it was not my fault at all, that I am a complete idiot, and that I should have called the cops immediately and gotten all of his information instead of being an apologetic wreck and being afraid to demand for his info because I thought I was somehow at fault. 

tl;dr I am too naive to be an adult, please help me

Edit: This is my first post to get anywhere near over 100 up votes to my knowledge, so this is blowing me away a bit. Thank you all for your kindness and advice, I will take it to heart and make sure to keep my head level in a similar situation in the future! 

Edit 2: I am not Canadian! I was born and bred in the southern US, currently residing in Louisiana :) 

*For all wondering how bad the damage actually was, it turns out that I had panicked and thought the damage was much worse than it was. In the end I am just left with a gash where the paint is gone in my bumper, but beyond that it isn't broken or dented (like I thought it was). I am incredibly blessed that that was all it was! (For the record, though, my car is still worse for it than the other guy's!) "
"Tifu by providing a spit sample


Obligatory this wasn't today. 

Posted a while ago but deleted instantly as per no posting bodily fluids during the weekdays rule. 

I'll keep it short without all the theatrics. 

Basically incredibly sick with a really high fever, my gp sends me to the hospital. Hospital decides to keep me overnight as my condition wasn't getting any better. I had been sleepless for a few nights and this night at hospital was no different, especially being checked on by nurses every hour. 

Morning comes and I finally manage to fall asleep, only to be awoken by yet another nurse I hadn't met before. I'm still in a drowsy haze and he hands me a small cup and says ""I need you to shit in this"" I think, huh? I respond ""can I do it later?"" thinking I don't need to make any bowel movements right now. He says that's fine and leaves. I fall back asleep. I have a great sleep and when I wake up I am reminded of the small cup on my bedside. I realise how ridiculous it is I need to provide a stool sample in something so small and how will I manage. 

I go over to the toilet and try for a very long time to push something out. Lucky for me I pop out the perfect sized little nugget and I catch it with the cup. I put the lid back on, wipe up and proudly go back to my bed and buzz the nurse over. Nurse takes the cup and leaves. Short whole later nurse comes running back into the room and is holding the cup up, shaking it going ""what is this? Is it your spit?"" I say ""umm, no it's my shit."" I start laughing uncontrollably realising I had misheard the request for a spit sample and thought he had asked for shit. He seemed amused but more embarrassed than me and explained how the people in the lab opened the cup and were wondering why my spit had solidified before they thought maybe it's something else. I was given a stool softener and discharged two days later, but oh boy everyone on the ward knew what had happened and I was incredibly embarrassed my entire stay. 

Tldr; nurse asks me for a spit sample,i misheard and tool it to the bathroom and provided a shit sample."
"TIFU by opening the freezer door


So as promised, the freezer story.

 So back in 2009 I left high school and had the summer before heading off to Uni. Since the majority of my friends were going to scatter across the globe come September we decide on a group holiday to one of the Canary Islands.

Holiday is going well with no major incidents. I did get dunked once in the pool; panicked, could not find up and propelled head first into the floor of the pool. You know standard stuff. At some point about three days before we were to fly home most of us were running low on funds, so we bought a bunch of foodstuff to cook for ourselves instead of eating out. Now the fridge/freezer combo in the villa had the larger fridge section at the bottom and a smaller freezer area above. Since 10 of us were trying to cook at once both the fridge and freezer sections were constantly being opened and closed. 

Have you ever left a freezer opened for an extended period of time, closed it, then tried to reopen it? Yeah, the jaws of life struggle. So I go to open the freezer and it’s had enough of being opened and closed, it’s tired, it’s grumpy and it’s fucking staging a sit in. Negotiations broke down fairly quickly, as the freezer already had hostages. I, with my false sense of bravado decided, the fuck am I being beaten by a freezer door (spoiler alert; I was beaten by a freezer door). So I braced my foot against the fridge door and hulked out on the freezer door. The door, not expecting a full frontal assault by a wannabe member of the Avengers, opened.

 I was not prepared for this.

 As a result, the freezer door swiftly punishes me with a jab to the face. I dropped like a sack of spuds. Luckily or unluckily, it walloped me in the forehead and the bridge of my nose at an angle so I didn’t actually break my nose. Though it bloody felt like it. A few hours later I look like a cross between a demented panda and cat women. Both my nose and forehead felt like the nerve ending were re-enacting the entire skirmish, and the swelling meant my eye was being swallowed by my face. So two of the guys decided that the hospital was the next tourist attraction on my list and off we went. Explaining to the doctor was fine, though he was confused at first, until one of the guys with me mimed the saga out on a medicine cupboard. Then it was just bloody hilarious. I think the nurse thought the bigger of the two guys with me had hit me. Doctor gave me care instructions and a bottle of pain killers. Though hindsight suggests they were not painkillers. We called a taxi and I popped two of the pills and got in the car.

 Guys I don’t know what those pills were, but I don’t remember anything after taking them. Nothing. Apparently I was screech/singing the opening lines of The Lion King in the backseat of the taxi. For the whole 40min return trip. I was also told I made a beeline for the pool claiming “It’s ok, I’m half panda now. I can breathe underwater”. I took all the books off the bookshelf and hid them in everyone’s pillow cases, I also hid beneath one guy’s bed. There is also video (that will never see the light of day so don’t ask) of me slow dancing with a deck chair while screeching The Righteous Brothers, Unchained Melody. I don’t remember a damn thing; all I know is I woke up the next morning on my bed, fully clothed, without shoes and little daisy like flowers had been place between my toes. 

**TL, DR: Lost a fight with a freezer door resulting in a hospital visit and a prescription resulting in memory loss.** 

&amp;nbsp;


**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned how quickly I went from taking the pills to Disney show tunes. All I can say is that everything I wrote about after getting in the taxi is second hand, my friends told me what I’d done, though there was some video. For all I know I was perfectly fine for the first 20mins of that taxi ride before things got Disney and they just said “yeah, you were doing xyz for the whole ride”. I basically just told you what they told me. I hope this clears things up for some people.
A big thank you goes out to /u/DanRowan, who took the time to edit my spelling and grammar. Also a big thank you goes out to whoever gilded this post. 


 **Video**. I will definitely not be posting the video. Right now I feel safe knowing I am faceless and nameless, no one could pick me out of a crowd, which is especially comforting after receiving some rather mean PMs. If I post that video, the feeling goes away. There is also the fact that it contains rather a lot of identifying material and I don’t have permission to post it from the other people in it.
I’ve had more than a few nasty PMs regarding my writing abilities, which to be honest has shredded my confidence. I am not a writer; my job field is not even close to anything resembling creative or comic writing. This started out as sharing a few funny experiences with the world and has just rapidly descended into a shit show. It isn’t fun anymore and I now feel a little uneasy checking my messages on Reddit. I agree, is entirely my fault, both for posting grammar and spelling mistakes and for letting things get to me. So, no more stories for a while, I’m going to take a break from posting.

"tifu by locking a baby bear in my garage


I was woken up at around 3am by some rustling going on outside. I knew right away a bear was making a mess somewhere near by. I look out my window and sure enough a black bear has managed to lift my garage door and has made an awful mess of my garbage. So I do what I usually do when a bear is in my yard and run outside yelling profanity grasping a broom and banging it on the siding. Sure enough the bear has had enough of my yelling and fucks off. 

Now here's where I fucked up. I closed my garage door. Now I can hear this fucking bear making an awful lot of noise off in the distance. Sort of like a deeper more menacing dog cry. I open up the side door and sure as shit there's a little black bear cub deep within the mess of my garage crying away. And I can still hear mom crying away in the distance. So I bolted inside and called the non emergency line for the police. I just need some help getting my garage door open (it won't open from the outside) so this cub can get out of my garage. Well apparently there's no one on duty at 3 am so I'm stuck here listening to this awful crying outside. 

TLDR; Scared a momma bear out of my yard and locked a baby bear in my garage by accident. Now I can't sleep due to bears 
crying.

Edit; here's the photo the police took for me http://imgur.com/JLaB3Vq

Edit; the baby bears are gone now! I'm hopeing they rejoined their mom to go and destroy more garbage cans and roam around the neighborhood. Thank you all for all the help and advice!"
