"Update- My husband tried to close our accounts and kick myself and the kids out of our house.


Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us.

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone."

"UPDATE - Me [52M] As a Single Dad found out my [16F] daughter goes to Narcotics Anonymous Meetings





OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5563d5/me_52m_as_a_single_dad_found_out_my_16f_daughter/

Hi everyone! 

I am incredibly thankful for everyone’s comments and suggestions. Since my first post, things took a bit of a turn from her progress, but today she is back to 30 days sober!We have not proceeded with rehab, but here’s what has happened since then. 

2 weeks after my first post, my daughter came home from her work and asked me if she could borrow the health savings card and pick up her medication the next day. I said no, I would get it for her myself as I usually do. She protested for a minute or so but I was firm. She left it at that. 

For the rest of the night she was unusually quiet. She’s usually quite talkative with her grandparents who live with us, or myself and her sister. Not that night. This was slightly concerning, but I didn’t raise any questions. 

Fast forward to around midnight, my daughter came to me and spilled A LOT of details about her drug past. It was a lot of information to take in at one time, and finally she got to the point that she relapsed and needed the health savings card to get detoxed. After my momentary shock passed, I told her that I loved her and that I would go with her to the detox center, and that she didn’t need to hide things from me. I didn’t tell her about how I found out she’s already in meetings, I figured that could be my little secret or it can emerge when the time is right. 

After that, she got detoxed and all was well for a while before she relapsed again. She was much more straight-forward about it that time, and since that detox, everything has been going smooth. She is back into counseling and takes a 4-day a week class for getting her high school diploma. Today she is 30 days sober and is celebrating her sobriety / birthday with some friends. 

I appreciate every single comment! Thank you everyone for their kind words and advice. I feel good about the approach I took, although I would go back and change some things, she is getting the help she needs and we have a more open line of communication. She is more lively, is getting back into her passions, and is much, much happier. I’m still feeling guilty that I didn’t pick up the signs of addiction soon enough, but she assured me she has forgiven me and that I don’t need to worry about it at all. 

Happy ending! Thank you everyone!

TL;DR: 30 days sober today, and all is well after a few hiccups!"

Three years ago we had an argument and she told me in the middle of it that she regrets not aborting me and it was the greatest mistake of her life. I was really hurt and stopped talking to her. She apologized a few weeks later in a voicemail telling me that she only said it in the heat of the moment and didn't mean it but it looked like she did. She's said similar thing in the past too, like ""if you weren't born I could have gone to college and had a good career"". I think she really meant it.

Now almost everyone including my dad, grandparents and siblings tell me that I'm allowing something trivial to tear our family apart and I should forgive her. But I'm still hurt for what she said.

"How do I [32 MtF] say thank you to my (foster) parents for being so amazing?


I was placed with my foster parents when I was 12 because my biological mother died from an overdose when I was 5 and after she passed way and my ""father"" abused me. I have no contact with him.

I'll refer to my foster parents as mum and dad though.

I never felt right in my body but I couldn't articulate why- I preferred ""girly things"" which my dad hated and as soon as I started to hit puberty I become extremely depressed. 

I was withdrawn, anti-social and my mum didn't understand why. When I was 14 years old I figured out I was trans and tried to kill myself. My mum walked into my room just as I was trying and then I broke down and told her I was trans and gay to boot.

She held me for a very long time told me none of those things were a problem and then the both of them pretty much threw themselves into research about transitioning, what to do etc, puberty blockers, hormones and even found me a therapist who specializing in transgender children - it was and hour both ways and they'd take turns waiting in the car while I was in my session.

Mum took me shopping, taught me how to apply makeup, gave me books, dating advice, bought me a sewing machine when I expressed interest in sewing. 

Both of them fought with CPS to have me change schools when I went through an awkward non-passing teenager stage when I was bullied. Went to meetings with me, dressed down teachers and other parents who didn't understand. Financially helped me out with surgery.

Basically supported me all the way.

No matter what they did, I was depressed. But I feel like it had been anyone else, I'd be dead by now. I was depressed but I found the strength to keep going sometimes for the only reason that I didn't want to be ungrateful for all the effort they were putting in but some days, I was really hanging on by a thread.

I was pretty bad at some stages, I'd written myself of as a lost cause, and the feedback to them at that time probably wasn't encouraging. I wasn't cheerful, social, even doing that well academically, had behavioral issues and a chip on my shoulder and at one stage when I was 18 I nearly had a drug problem but somehow pulled myself back before it became a fully fledged thing.

I tested the limits of their affection a lot. 

Now I'm 32 years old, fully transitioned, starting a PhD, lecture at a uni and I've been in an amazing relationship with an amazing woman for the last 5 years. 

We're currently looking to adopt a child and as a result I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that my parents have sacrificed for a kid that originally wasn't even theirs. 

I've always thought about it but now that we are looking into the kind of sacrifice, time commitment, lifestyle change etc that having a child involves, I think about it constantly. 

They never once were obligated to do anything that they did for me. 

I was probably the reason why they didn't take on another foster child-I was a handful all by myself. I've maybe denied another kid out there who needed support from parents like these because of how difficult I was.

I want a way to thank them, I see them often (weekly) and talk to them almost everday, even just for 5 minutes and they tell me/I tell them I love you pretty much every time we talk- it's a habit I got into after I left for college and realized how much I missed them. 

But I'm looking for an over and above type thing- if that even exists - not in a money kind of way but just gratitude or something if it even exists. 

I'm not trying to ""pay them back"", I really just want to show how much I am humbled and appreciate everything they've done now that I'm starting to get even just a glimpse of what they've done for me which I wasn't mature enough to realize at the time.

"I [27m] have a flexible work schedule, and my girlfriend [26f] does not. She always pretends to be sick when I have the day off, and it's getting annoying. How do I talk to her about it?


Using a throwaway, and I'll try to keep this short.

My girlfriend Sarah and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and we currently live together. We've talked about marriage and I'm very sure that I want to get engaged in the next year or so. However, a recent issue has been cropping up and I'm not sure if it's a ""red flag"" or not. 

About 6 months ago I got a new job at a tech company in our city. It's one of your typical tech jobs — I get lots of perks, can work from home whenever I want, and I get unlimited paid time off. On top of that, they let us work flexible hours and are great about giving us company time off (on top of the unlimited PTO). In short, it's a great job and I'm very happy with it. 

Sarah works a corporate job and is has been unhappy there for awhile. Her job is the opposite of mine...she gets 2 weeks vacation, limited sick days, and I'm pretty sure her company would give her no vacation days if they could. Everyone works long hours and there's absolutely no way she could work from home. To summarize — she does not like her job. 

So, my issue: Whenever I have time off and she doesn't, or I take an actual sick day, or I work from home more than 3 days a week, Sarah always ends up ""getting sick"" and calling out of work that day. I can see right through her — she's not actually sick, but she's jealous that I get so much time off and she wants to spend time with me. *Which is fine*, I get it. 

The part that bothers me is that on top of her taking sick days, she expects me to take care of her and dote on her. She often wants me to spend all day in bed with her, or order her food, or whatever. This has become an annoying habit of hers for the past 6 months, and I'm sick of it. 

Also, to be completely honest, sometimes I would like that time for myself *without* her. I appreciate my independence and while I love her and want to spend time with her, it's not fun when she's laying in her pajamas all day and asking me to order her Indian food. Sometimes I'd like to spend that time the way I want to. 

I see a few other issues within this behavior as well:

* Sarah doesn't like her job and needs a new one, one with a flexible schedule at least. As much as I've tried to get her to apply for jobs, helped her with her resume and cover letter, she can't seem to be motivated to look for a new job. She loves complaining about her job, but seems too complacent in it to actually do anything about it. 

* With the amount of time Sarah takes off at her current job, she has a large amount of ""negative"" vacation hours and sick days. This gets in the way when we want to plan for trips, because she often isn't able to take time off because of how many negative days she's accrued. 

* I feel like she's also become complacent in our relationship, and just expects me to take care of her when she's sick. Which would be fine, if she wasn't ""sick"" every week. At this point I feel like she's making excuses, and I struggle with being that asshole boyfriend that doesn't take care of her or just tells her to get over it. 

So I guess I'm wondering, what can I do? Her behavior has been such a turn off lately, and I'm struggling with how to tell her that I know she's faking being sick and that I'm over it. I *don't* want to accuse her of faking it, but I know she is. How do I bring it up delicately and getting my point across?

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR - Girlfriend pretends to be sick every time I have a day off or take a sick day. Makes excuses and it's become a bad pattern of behavior. How do I bring this up to her gently?

I have difficulties opening up and don't really have anyone I can turn to for advice, so I'm hoping that this is the right place.

My father &amp; only family died suddenly in 2011 when I was doing my last year in high school. The death caused me to lose my scholarships and friends, I have been on my own since then working like crazy to pay bills and get myself through college, having no time to make friends or even being relatively comfortable to open up to anyone.

I have been working with the same company for the past 4 years, switching multiple positions and departments just to chase that higher dollar. During these switches I have bumped into a coworker who looks and acts exactly like of my late father. Let's call him Peter.

Peter is a lovely older man, he is the maintenance and landscaper guy of the company. Peter is such a gentle soul and extremely hard working just like my dad, he walks and talks and laughs exactly like my father, he even looks like him in height and face, it's driving me crazy, making me believe that he's come back to life when I know that this is a totally different person! He is so much like my father that I can't even act normally anymore, I have suppressed the feelings so much over the years that I just don't know how to behave. 

*A few weeks ago after work, my old car was having troubles and I had to pull over on the main highway in our city. Peter saw me and pulled over, he helped bring my car back to life just enough to drive it to a shop. When I got to the shop with Peter following, he offered to help me find a better car that wasn't so old, even let me borrow his second car that his son doesn't use anymore... His kind words and helpfulness made me start to bawl right in front of him at the shop, things became awkward &amp; he thought I was crying because of my car issues. But in reality I was crying because I really wish that my dad was here instead &amp; that he could be here himself to help me out, made me think how much different the world would be if he was still alive.

Fast forward to now, I have been awkward/embarrassed and avoiding Peter whenever he tries to check up on me with my car issues or even bumping into him in the building. I know that he knows that I'm avoiding him, I don't mean to be rude but I just don't know what to do/say after such a unexpected meltdown, I just want to cry alone in my office. I am now realizing that I may need to talk to a therapist due to all these closed up emotions, but I just need to know what I can do now to not be awkward &amp; not bawl my eyes out at work.
  ---   
 TL;DR: Working with a coworker who is a copy/paste of my late father, I thought I was over his death but clearly I am not. I don't know how to handle my feelings or future encounters with this coworker without bawling my eyes out.

"Someone's been pissing on the men's room floor at work and I [31/M] think I may have identified the culprit. What should I do?


Needless to say, this is absolutely disgusting. It all started about a month ago, which makes me think it's someone new at the office. There's only one urinal, and beneath it is just tons of piss. It's impossible to avoid, your soles end up all sticky and the whole room just reeks.

This morning, I was making my morning constitutional and heard someone come in and use the urinal. Right before he left, another guy came in. When I emerged from the stall, the second guy looked at me and was like, ""Dude, any idea who's been pissing on the floor?"" So I asked him who it was who left when he walked in. He replied it was the new guy in finance. 

Bingo!

Granted, the new guy doesn't seem the type, but then again, no one really seems the type. What kind of person pisses on the floor? Which leads me to believe that perhaps there's some sort of odd medical condition that may account for this: uncontrollably shaky hands perhaps or a stream that's somehow ultra-pressurized. Either way, it's made trips to the bathroom very unpleasant and I have no doubt the custodial staff shares my disgust. Obviously, I have no smoking gun evidence it's him and it would be pretty unfeasible and undoubtedly fireable to attempt to get it. What should I do?

TL;DR: I think I know who's been pissing on the men's room floor. Now what?

EDIT: Thanks to the person who commented that it could be a leaky urinal. I wouldn't have thought of that. While I don't necessarily believe it is a leak, it provided me the opening I needed to email our custodial manager without making it seem like I was accusing someone."

My school has block scheduling. We have 2 days, and half of our classes on each day. Hence, homework assigned Monday is due Wednesday.

Today, I had some leftover homework assigned yesterday to finish for tomorrow. I did it, and it took me a few hours. Then, I took an hour's break. My mom came into my room and screamed at me for 48:56 (taped it, if you're wondering why it's so specific.) minutes. She screamed about how I have no extra skills in life besides school (so I don't know things about cars, computers etc. like my much more knowledgeable brother does), that I don't have any skills besides academics (or else she wouldn't care so much about it) and that it's not like I can act or be a model. 

She also yelled about how my work was crappy and how my teachers find errors when they grade my papers because I don't read the over. This was when she finally got around to addressing the paper I was actually doing today, which was a bunch of questions about a document that everyone else always hand writes. They answer in a page, maybe front and back, and I do it in 5 typed pages. Still, my work is not that great, and I need to do better or else I will end up a leech upon someone in the world according to my mom. Also, my work takes too long and I need to go faster, I lie all the time, and the only thing I'm interested in is watching TV. It apparently started so that I could fit in social but now I'm addicted to it and I always run to it and I act like she's the one making me study when I picked my classes. She wants me to drop all my classes from AP to CP (2 levels down from AP) at my school so that I can handle it.

There was more of that and then she takes my phone and computer and makes me sit in her room while she sleeps with the light on to monitor me. She said she wont be able to go to work or do well there tomorrow because I was keeping her up since I wouldn't do work unless monitored. So I moved to the work that was due Thursday. Then, she tells me that from now on until I go to college I must surrender my phone and computer and do work in the kitchen so that I am monitored in a public space. I can only go to my room when done and never have anymore TV or fun time with my tech. She will tell me to study for my SAT subject tests from now on after homework. This is until I graduate college.

To be fair to her, I do take a while to do homework, I did spend 2 hours of free time instead of homework, and couldn't account for those hours and I do need to eventually have time after hmwk to study for subject tests, even though they are in May and I have a while to study. 

To be fair to me, My GPA is 99.16 and my QPA is well over a 100 once my APs at factored in. Also, all the homework due the next day was done by 9. I really need some relaxation time or I'm going to be stressed. I'm also too addicted to reddit and TV not to have 1-2 hours of it a day. I don't know how to do better, or if I'm the problem or my parents are. Help.

Tldr; my parents took away TV and fun time until I go to college because I didn't do my homework as fast as they wanted. How can I go faster without loosing some free time or am I not the problem?"

I'm not really sure what I can even do in this situation. I've already told my brother it creeps me out but he's been on some weird pretentious kick since him and his wife divorced. He thinks his kids need to learn to respect him more. 


If they forget, which kids do, he seems like he's too hard on them. They get punished even if they apologize and correct themselves because he thinks it's been too long for them to not be in the habit now. Often ending outings and taking them home because they ""can't behave themselves in public"" or sending them to time out while the rest of us continue without them. Other kids don't call every adult sir/ma'am with every breath and their mother doesn't require it so it's pretty confusing for them to suddenly be treated like brats over it. 


He also tells me I can't take them places if I won't enforce his rules. I don't stop them from calling me it because it's already confusing enough for them to switch back between mom and dad but I'm not going to discipline them over it if they forget. It's really fucking embarrassing to be around him in public when he's chewing a kid out for disrespecting him. He sounds like an abusive, insecure, controlling dickhead. 


Our parents hardline told him they're ""grandma and grandpa"" not ""Sir and Ma'am"" and now they're not allowed unsupervised visits. I love my nieces and nephew and having them constantly ""sir""ing me is awkward and makes me feel slimy. Is there anything I can say to make my brother see reason?


**tl;dr:** After his divorce my brother has insisted his kids call adults ""Sir and Ma'am"" every time they speak and punishes them if they forget. It's uncomfortable and causing family tension. Is there anything I can do?"

"Me [31F] with my Husband [31M], about to announce our pregnancy, my BIL [32M] keeps making negative comments about how clueless we are with kids


Hi guys,

Not sure if this is the best place to post this (long time lurker, first time posting) but I could really use your advice! Throw away because I don't want any family to find this.

Hubby and I together for 8 years, married for 2. I'm nearing on 3 months pregnant, so the 12 week scan is coming up and if everything is looking good - we'll be announcing soon to our family and friends! Exciting! Nobody else knows.

Only issue is... my BIL is extremely obnoxious and competitive, and I'm not quite sure how to deal with his behaviour, which I suspect is about to escalate.  

To paint the picture - he and his wife [30F] have twin girls [1.5F]. We were very happy for them when they fell pregnant, have babysat, done our best to give them really thoughtful gifts for birthdays and Christmas, helped entertain and watch them on family outings, and things like that. But the truth is, neither of us have felt 100% comfortable with the little ones because generally, BIL and his wife are very self entitled, judgemental and critical. It just feels like you have to walk on egg shells around them in life, and it has been this way even before their children were born. It's just this general unease, and as a result maybe we don't fuss over the girls as much as they would like.

BIL has previously been really aggressive and demanded that my husband come around and ""clean his house"" because he's done ""nothing to help since the girls came along"" (which is not true) and has made some other fairly outrageous demands which hubby has pretty much ignored due to them being ridiculous. Whilst I appreciate that being new parents and having twins is challenging and they are under a lot of stress, it was their decision to have kids, and they seem to think that everyone else should be altering their lifestyles to accommodate their kids too. And they aren't without help - the grandparents are always around assisting. They've said we're ""not ready for children"" because we ""clearly aren't interested in their kids"". They've gone around saying this to a lot of people, which is really hurtful in general, particularly as I feel neither of them have bothered to get to know me as a person and make such a claim.

BIL constantly makes comments such as, ""I can't wait until you have kids so you see how hard it is"", ""just you wait"" and ""you guys have no idea"" in a pretty nasty, condescending tone. These comments are always unprovoked. We have never commented on their parenting ability, and we are super accommodating and understanding of their routine and schedule, etc. We always do all we can to not make their lives any more complicated.

I think BIL went into their pregnancy pretty uneducated in general, and I think a lot of his frustrations stems from how unprepared he was for the lifestyle change. I think he is projecting.

Hubby and I are generally really passive people and choose to ignore it for the most part, or awkwardly laugh it off. I've spoken to him about this, but he thinks ignoring his brother's temper tantrums is for the best.

Basically, I just want some help in handling some of these comments, and the fact I think they'll escalate once the pregnancy is announced. He's been shaming us publicly for awhile in front of family and family friends for not ""understanding"" how hard it is having kids, and I'm a bit tired of feeling like a doormat. I understand his comments stem from his own frustration, but often his wife joins in, and I just find it really unnecessary and like a slap in the face given how considerate we try to be. We're pretty confident that things will turn into ""oh just imagine how hard that is with TWO"", and I feel like it is only going to get worse from here on out. It's not a competition, this is a happy time, and I'm just sick of them shitting on the both of us. I don't want this to extend into him comparing his children to ours, or worse.

Any advice on how I can shutdown these comments in a graceful way? Or is my hubby right, should we just continue to ignore their behaviour? Writing this out it just seems so petty compared to some of the other posts on this sub, but I'm tired of listening to the same comments again and again.

  **tl;dr**: About to announce pregnancy to family and friends, but BIL keeps publicly making comments about how we ""aren't ready"" for kids, and how ""clueless"" we are about how hard it is, when we've given him no reason to think/say this. I believe these condescending comments will escalate and he will constantly be trying to one up us because he has twin infants. I'm tired of hearing it. How can I shut this down gracefully?"

"My upset mother [39] wants me [20 f] to loan money for her rent but I refuse because I know she won't pay me back


Pretty much the title says it all. I'm a college student on winter break, came home for the holidays. I have money saved up for my rent. About 3 months worth. I could loan her the money if I truly wanted to but I don't. 

My mother works as a childcare provider from home and at Target. While I understand that her income may not be enough for her, her husband, 3 remaining children (10, 17 and one who is 23 and doesn't pay rent) and my uncle (who occasionally lets her use his car since she doesn't have one anymore) to live off of but there are more than enough adults living here that can contribute to this household. My older brother works but doesn't give her money and she doesn't enforce that he should. Her husband, however, contributes absolutely nothing. He doesn't work or anything. They don't have a car so they just sit around all day. Not sure how that works but if it doesn't bother her, so be it. 

Ever since we all got our first jobs, my mom has asked us for money. After loaning her money from our pockets and even from other people like family or close friends then finding out where it went (or didn't go), my family and I had come to the conclusion years ago that she is financially irresponsible. She still owes my older sister $800 for utility bills. It's not really a secret that she's not the best with money. 

So now, I go back to school in 2 weeks. She used all of her extra money to buy a bunch of gifts for my younger brother for Christmas. Gifts I didn't even know she could afford such as the Xbox One. My brother somehow tricked her into getting her card info and bought a few games which put her in the bind she's in now. Her rent was due on the first. I knew eventually she was going to ask me for money but she didn't do it immediately so I thought I was in the clear and that she, a grown woman with a husband, came up with the extra money or thought up a plan. Apparently not. 

Her landlord gives her a 5-day grace period to pay rent. When we deny her money, she calls any friend that'll listen or our father or grandparents to complain to them. My grandparents are old and tired. They only have enough energy and money to take care of themselves so they're tired of lending her money. At this point, they try to get us to give her the money so they don't have to. My father doesn't stand for it and it mostly leads to either a brawl or my dad simply hanging up on her. 

I'm the easiest one to cave in and one of the more financially responsible in the family. She usually gets really upset when we refuse to hand over the money just like a few minutes ago. We were just in the car (my uncle's car) when she says ""You're gonna have to give me some money."". When I said no, her demeanor changed entirely. She was whining how her kids never want to help her, how she's going to stop helping us and telling me she should kick my ""ugly a#!"" out the car now. I said nothing but put my headphones back in. She goes on these rants every time she doesn't get her way with us. When we got home, she slammed the door in my face before I could walk in the house. My uncle talked to me and assured me that he was going to give her the money and have my brother help out but he isn't mad that I'm standing my ground because he knows how my mom can be. 

I'm really considering staying elsewhere for the duration of my visit because I don't like the tension she's created. My mother can erupt from the smallest of things when she's upset and sometimes it can get violent so I keep my distance. But I didn't come home for all of this. I came upon the request of my mother wanting me here since I'm away at school 99% of the year. I want to take care of my parents someday but when I'm financially stable myself. Am I supposed to just give her money upon demand though? Do I just cut my break short and go back home? I know she's my mom but it's not my responsibility to make sure she's financially set when she and her husband are fully able to fend for themselves. 



Tldr: my mom wants $300, I can't just give her that because of adult things, she's pissed, this is ruining my winter break 

UPDATE: She fixed me snickerdoodles, hugged me, tried to sweet talk me into giving her the money, I stood my ground. She told me she'll never help me with anything, ""fuck you"" and she said she ALMOST wants me to leave now. I'm gonna pack my things and head to my grandparents house for the rest of my break. 

SECOND UPDATE: Packed my bags, was trying to clean guest room before I left, mom confronted me, called me disrespectful for not telling her I was leaving, told me she's going to get my dad to stop paying for college and then demanded I take my crap and get out. Somberly, my uncle and brother helped me get my things into an UBER, got to grandparents house, I'm content. Probably gonna cut my stay a tad shorter and head back home a few days earlier than planned. "

"Guy (19m) who I (18f) rejected in high school is showing up at my house randomly and stares at me at the gym. Is this harmless behavior or is getting closer to stalking?


Hey reddit, I normally lurk on here more than I post but I have a bit of a problem.

There's this guy, let's call him Dean, who I went to a small high school with. The staff caught him doing weird stuff (going into details would be kind of mean and unnecessary for the story) and it got spread around the school, so a lot of people made fun of him. My friend group would invite him to sit at our lunch table sometimes since he was usually alone and seemed like a harmless guy. He was generally pretty quiet and would make the occasional joke or comment.

Something to keep in mind here as you read the next few paragraphs is that he is autistic, I figure it might help with some context of his behavior. Also- this wasn't what the dealbreaker was for me, my current boyfriend is actually autistic, I just frankly don't find Dean physically attractive or compatible to my personality. Sorry if this sounds defensive, I got criticized in high school for not ""just giving him a chance"" so as unnecessary as it sounds, I feel the need to explain myself.

I was one of the few single girls in the group who was nice to him, and because of this I think he got a little attached. He started telling people he had a big crush on me and it being a small school, I heard about it quickly. He asked me out later that year and I turned him down. For the next two years of high school, he would try to ask me to school dances or to go see a movie at least once a year. Each time, I would try to be polite but would tell him no, I wasn't interested in that. I just wanted to be friends.

He would also give me a rose every valentine's day, although to be fair this eventually expanded to one for every girl in our lunch group. It got to the point that in senior year, I pretended to already be going with my friend so he wouldn't ask me to prom like he was telling people he wanted to.

He also joined every club I was apart of during these years. One of these was film club, where he made a suggestion that my character strip naked in one scene of the film. I sometimes felt as if he was trying to pressure me into dating him by making passive-aggressive comments about how no girls like him (this didn't make me more attracted to him, obviously). One memorable moment in senior year was when he told a ""joke"" about how he would commit suicide if a girl didn't go out with him soon and then gave me a pointed look across the lunch table.

We both started our first year at our college last fall. We're in the same major program, so I see him around campus from time to time. He's also gotten to know my boyfriend since they're in the same campus autism counseling group. I figured that since he knew I had a boyfriend now and he was meeting new girls outside of our tiny high school, his crush on me would fade. I'm not so sure now.

A few of my friends ran into Dean on campus during the first semester, and apparently he asked all of them where my dorm was and what room number I had. Luckily none of them gave it to him, but I thought it was strange. He also started texting me a lot more. He's invited me to parties or to go out to eat around midnight on school nights, and then says something passive-aggressive if I didn't answer (usually because I was sleeping or studying). He joined a club on campus and would ask me to come to every meeting on Friday, and although I was genuinely interested in the club's topic, Friday nights were my only night free and I usually spent them with my friends or boyfriend instead.

I finally felt bad about blowing him off for so long, so when he asked if we could study together, I invited him to join my study group for finals. He came to a session and it was fine and he wasn't acting weird around me, so I assumed he was trying to reach out in friendship but just wasn't sure how. I wasn't really interested in being close friends with him, but I tried not to think ill of him.

But things have gotten weirder this winter break. The dorms are closed and I'm staying with my parents (which is a whole other emotional can of worms, but I'll save that for another post). Dean texted me ""how's your break going?"" before Christmas, but I didn't answer because I was just so swamped. Then on the night of Christmas while I was setting the table for dinner, the doorbell rang. My sister opened it up and sure enough, it was Dean. He'd driven to my house in the rain (we live in the woods on the edge of town) on Christmas?? I was so shocked.

He came into my house, gave me and my siblings each a hug, and asked how everyone was doing. Then he asked my mom for her phone number. He asked if I was planning on having a holiday party because he wants to help me throw it. I said I wasn't, but thanks anyway. I asked him if he was just in the neighborhood and he assured me that he drove all the way to my house. He said we need to catch up and then left. (Btw, it's worth noting he knows my address because he came to my house for a club thing a few years ago, he didn't just look me up).

It was a weird encounter but I hoped it was a one time thing. He texted me after and I ignored him. But a few days after Christmas my mom was driving out the neighborhood and she passed Dean's truck coming down the road. She asked him what he was doing and he said he ""needed to talk to [my name]"". My mom said I wasn't home at the moment, and he can't just drop by unannounced. He apologized and said that he doesn't mean to intrude, but I never answer his texts. He told her next time he'll text before he comes over.

Since then he's texted my mom that he's here for her if she ever needs help (??) and tried to call her a few times.

But there's also another issue. I live for my gym time and go there at least 4/5 nights a week. Lately I've been working out at the on-campus gym, but since it's the break, I've been going to the one in town my family has a membership at. Dean's family also has a membership there. I see his mom there all the time but recently he's been going as well. Since we both go at night, I've bumped into him a few times through the past year but it's not a big deal, I just try not to make too much eye contact because he will try to get me into a conversation and I prefer to have my work out time to myself.

But now the last 3 or 4 times I've gone to the gym, he's been there at the same time and I feel like I'm being watched. He was there yesterday and also tonight. Tonight's incident really freaked me out because he texted me in the morning asking ""what's up?"" and I didn't reply because I was busy. Then my mom told me she saw him driving through the neighborhood but didn't get a chance to stop him and ask what he was doing. I was home at that time and didn't hear the doorbell ring, which means he just drove past my house to see if I was there, I guess. (Like I said before, our house is very out of the way of town. No one just drives through here as a short cut).

Then when I went to the gym tonight, he was there and I was careful about not acknowledging him, like I have the last few times. I swear that he moved up a row of treadmills while I was doing weight training, because when I looked behind me he was closer. I was there with my sister and she said he stared at me on and off the entire hour we were there. A few times I caught him doing this, so I know she isn't messing with me.

I felt so uncomfortable the whole night I could barely work out. I hate feeling watched while I'm in what used to be my favorite place. I had to stay on one side of the gym for half the night until he moved to a different machine and I could finish my weights and squats without feeling his eyes on me.

He's harmless and would never hurt me, I'm sure of that. And I know I shouldn't judge someone before knowing all the facts. But I'm starting to get a little creeped out. Do I have a valid reason to be upset here or should I just let it blow over? If I do confront him, what do I say?

**tl;dr: We're in college now, but a casual friend from my high school who asked me out a few times over the years has started texting me a lot, showing up at my house randomly and staring at me while I'm at the gym. He knows I have a boyfriend so I'm not sure if it's still romantic interest or just misguided friendship. He's also autistic if that factors in, and I'm not sure if I should be handling this more firmly or let it blow over.**"

"My BF (25M) thinks I'm gaslighting him, I (23F) think he's just forgetful


My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and overall have a good relationship. We have had our issues but overcome them.

One of the biggest issues we have is thoughtfulness. By nature, I am very aware, empathetic and thoughtful and remember small details about people. He, on the other hand, is forgetful and doesn't notice things around him much and is also more hyperactive and impulsive. He also has the textbook signs for ADHD (hyperactivity, lack of restraint, impulsivity), which he has agreed with me and acknowledged. He even set up an appointment with a psychiatrist to get tested, but had to cancel because he no longer has health insurance under his job. (He is still planning to go once he gets it again, until this conversation). 

Because of this, things will come up in day to day conversations where I say, remember we have X on this day. To which he replies ""you never told me that!"" After several minutes of me reminding him when/how I told him this, he will remember and go ""oh, yes, now I remember you telling me!""

Anyways, things like this happen often where I say something, he claims I never told him and accuses me of lying, and then he remembers. However, recently he has told me he thinks I am gas lighting him (???). We have had some issues recently, and I think he is shifting the blame to me to avoid taking ownership of his part. I personally think it is on both of us, me for my intermittent negative/ annoyed reactions and him for his ADHD/ forgetfulness. He is adamant that I am manipulating him into thinking he is forgetful despite the past evidence.

Am I actually gas lighting him without knowing? I honestly think I am coming from a genuine place in trying to encourage to get treated for his ADHD, but now he is spinning it back on me. Also, does this sound like ADHD or just a maturity issue? I am so confused. Any help is greatly appreciated.


Also to add- he has also struggled in school and college with attention issues. This is a huge reason why we both think it may be ADHD. In addition, his dad passed away when he was in middle school, which was the beginning of his emotional/ educational issues (he never went to counseling for this loss).



Tldr; boyfriend is forgetful and has agreed he may have ADHD. Now he is saying I'm manipulative and gas lighting him. Help?! "
"I [40 M/F] initiated a 2 week trial separation with my wife [37 M/F]. Tomorrow is the last day of the separation. It was awesome for me, not for her, but she wants to keep trying to work on this. Advice on if I should just give up?


I have been with my wife for 10 years, married for almost 9. She is a strong-willed person, employed, very motivated, goal oriented, and a good mother to our child (8 yrs old). She is opinionated, but very insecure, has some anxiety (partially caused by me maybe, idk). She complains A LOT. She criticizes A LOT. Not complaints about my looks or personality, which she says she likes, and she says she loves me, but she is extremely confrontational about everything from what I do with my spare time, to who left a dish on the counter.  I am hardworking, easy to get along with, and overall I feel like I'm a pretty decent guy, although I've made one major mistake in our relationship in the past (infidelity, 5 years ago -- we've been in counseling ever since). 

Her complaints are nonstop. It's not a question on if or when she will complain -- she's at ""full steam ahead"" with the complaints, how unsatisfied she is with the rug, how dirty her car got today, how white trash the neighbors are, that she asked me to take the trash out 2 seconds ago and why haven't I done it yet?  I feel like I can't win and I live my life walking on eggshells. My friends and coworkers don't understand this spell she has on me, and neither do I. Why do I put up with it? Why don't I leave? I even look at Christmas or anniversary cards, and can't with good conscience even pick one out for her from the ""wife"" section because I don't truly ""feel"" any of the words and messages in the cards. My friends don't even want to come over because they are stifled by her mere presence. She's pretty and outwardly nice, but there's this negativity that hangs in the air and nobody can truly be themselves. I've given up all my hobbies, and she doesn't even allow me to be out of the house after 9:30 because she says she doesn't like not knowing where I am. She doesn't trust that I am where I say I am, because of the event 5 years ago. 5 years ago!!

We have not interests in common, except all of the work she wants done around the house (inside and outside, mostly manual labor, beautification, and improvements). And we have out daughter.

We get in weekly arguments, her calling me out on why I haven't done something, or why won't I have sex with her, or why do I have a shitty attitude, and I tell her over and over I can't have sex with you when I resent you (maybe that's atypical for a guy?), and my attitude is shitty because I feel stifled and unhappy. 

So 2 weeks ago, I suggested a 2 week separation. She didn't want to because she said she wouldn't like not knowing what I'm doing. I pushed it because I needed the space. It was the most AMAZING 2 weeks. No stress, no conflict. I spent it reading, catching up on work, changing my oil, watching football, relaxing, still did household chores and kid duties but eliminated all nonessential contact with her. I didn't go out and socialize, I didn't go looking for a girlfriend or go on a drinking binge like she thought I would. It was such a good time. 

Now I have to go back and have a discussion with her on how the 2 weeks went, what I learned about myself, how we might move forward in a better way, etc. She still thinks I need to 'fix' myself, and wants to move forward together. We've already had two arguments today about how she feels the separation was stupid. 

Should I just give up already? 5 years in counseling, totally lost myself and who I am, and I feel like a punching bag. I'm sorry if this was a rambling post, but I'm really at a loss for whether I should even keep trying. I was so happy for 2 weeks. 

Edit to add: The things that keep me second guessing this are the financial aspect (I'd be better off even paying child support because she's a SPENDER, but my daughter would lose her home and have to move because she can't afford the house in this school district on her own). And then there's my daughter, whom I do not want to harm.

TL:DR I initated a trial separation from my wife for 2 weeks. Based on the past and the recurring negative cycle she gets into, is it worth even continuing with the relationship?
