"Me [40M] with my Wife [40F] of 10 years, disappointing anniversary gift.


[removed]"
"[Update] My brother [27m] does some really creepy stuff and I'm [21f] done with him.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fz0bc/my_brother_27m_does_some_really_creepy_stuff_and/

I talked to my parents and told them I was tired of my brother's behavior and that they should do something, otherwise I wouldn't be going home anymore. They said I was being too ""extreme"" and that he would stop eventually, but that shit has been going on since we were kids and I knew he wasn't going to stop, so I gave them an ultimatum. They would talk to my brother and my brother would stop or the 3 of them could have a nice life.


My parents talked to him, after all. My brother refused to get evaluated at first... he was really upset. He went over to my dorm and tried to choke me. He screamed at me, then he tried to choke me, then he realized what he was doing and started crying and apologizing. Someone called the cops because my brother tried to kill himself afterwards.


Anyway, everything is ok now. I mean, not everything. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He didn't get a full-written report because it's been a week and it takes time, but that was the feedback and diagnosis. I'm going to be ok.
I just wanna say thank you for the advice and stuff, you know. I appreciate it (a lot). &lt;3


tl;dr: my brother ended up getting arrested for trying to choke me then kill himself then he got evaluated and now he's going to be ok, hopefully.

"[UPDATE] I [23 M] found my girlfriend's [23F] fake instagram account where she follows my exes, past flings, hookups, etc.


Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/)


So I decided to try to talk to my girlfriend casually about the account. 


I told her that when she was letting me use her phone (I logged her out of Instagram and was going to log into mine so that I could post a photo directly from her phone, and saw the other account as an option) I noticed the other account.


She looked horrified at first, but then without any prompting at all she confessed that she had a super insecure day after exactly the incident I was discussing with other commenters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g5f6u/i_23_m_found_my_girlfriends_23f_fake_instagram/dapmmqk/?st=iw8j5cz5&amp;sh=51581fcc)  (so thank you very much for making me introspect, reddit). She ranted to her best friend about how she was feeling, and the two of them made the account. They crept the accounts that accepted the follow requests, her friend helped her boost her ego a bit with some girl talk, and she completely forgot about it. 


She said she was having a really hard time when I was depressed, but felt like she couldn’t complain about it because my pain was “worse,” so she just sort of let a whole bunch get to her over time. 


She told me that she felt her poor handling of certain things this summer (her words), and the massive insecurity she felt, was an indicator that she probably needed to talk to someone and work through some things, and she’s actually been seeing a therapist every other week or so for the past few months. This wasn't just due to the summer, as she felt she's needed to do this for a while, it was just sort of what motivated her.

This shocked me, and she apologized for not telling me. She says that she felt like she couldn’t complain to me about her mental health when she knew I was going through so much. And then when I started to get better she didn’t know how to randomly bring it up since some time had past. 

I had no idea how hard my depression was on her. I feel so selfish that I didn’t even notice, but she says she completely understands, and she know how preoccupying depression can be. 

All in all, she apologized profusely for the account, deleted it in front of me, and we promised to try to get back to being the good communicators we were before my depression hit. 

TL;DR - Talked to her. She was embarrassed, had forgotten about the account, and revealed why she made the account without any prompting. She took trying to support me during my depression harder than I realized, and we're going to try to be better communicators. "

"My [38F] husband [45M] cheated on me and left me for [26F]. His side of the family is accusing me of turning our children [13M&amp;14F] against him. They chose to not talk to him after I got full custody.


Sorry for mistakes. I come from Ukraine and I live in America now where I met my ex husband. I have two children my son, Artem who is 13 and my daughter, Olena who is 14. They are honestly the two things that have kept me going. They are really good to each other. 

My husband had an affair with a young intern at his work. I had no idea until he told me he was leaving. He told me he has been seeing some other woman who made him feel young again. He told me that we are to be getting a divorce. He did this while the children were at school so at least they were not home for the argument. Time has passed and I have full custody of the children. 

They were talking not very nice things about their father. I have never said anything until the custody battle was done. They hated their father throughout the whole thing. They told him he ruined the family and they have both blocked him on Facebook. My children and I moved away to another state to start fresh. Financially we're fine, the lawyer made sure he was going to be legally forced to pay everything he had too. I have good job as well. 

His side of the family who I thought we had a good relationship with has been saying things. They have been saying it's my fault my children hate their farther. I can't raise two kids by myself. How horrible I am for moving away even though they could not wait. The children are happy in our new home and have made lots of friends. Do my children and I stop talking to them as well? My children told them I had nothing to do with it. It's all that they're father left us for a 26 year old.

**TL;DR: My children hate my ex husband. They hate him by themselves for cheating on me and destroying our family. His side of the family is blaming me for the reason they hate him.**"

So last month, my girlfriend got in a fight with another girl. The other girl was wearing a ring and got my girlfriend right in the eye and scratched it. It ended up getting infected so it had to be removed. Ever since then she's been avoiding me, even though I saw her right after the fight and saw what she looked like when it was basically at it's worse and I still thought she was beautiful then so why would I think she's ugly now? She won't answer my texts, except for one to tell me that she's sorry I have to be with someone as disgusting as her and if I broke up with her she'd understand. I don't want to break up with her, I love her to death. 2 eyes, 1 eye, or none, I couldn't care less. I want to be there for her and she just wont let me. I know she needs her time but I'm worried about her. So should I keep trying to talk to her or let her come to me?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fa8v8/my_crush_32f_asked_me_32m_out_but_im_so_nervous/

I know my post didn't get that much attention, but I wanted to post an update anyway. 

Maria and I went out for a walk on the beach (cheesy, right?), which is the most romantic thing I've ever done in my life, and it was better than I could have ever imagined. She held my hand and we ended up walking for hours and talking about everything. I even told her everything about my past and how I felt about her, and how I was nervous...and she was so understanding and supportive! I was afraid that she would not want to spend more time with me, but instead she thought it was really cute.

Then we had dinner together, and some drinks, and spent the evening in a dreamy, romantic haze. I don't know where this will go, but right now I'm on cloud nine.

Thank you so much to everyone who commented and told me to be open and direct! By telling her about how nervous I was, it took away all the tension and made me feel really wonderful when she was understanding and supportive.

"UPDATE: Discovered my [38 M] wife [38 F] of 17 years has been texting another man for 1.5 years and hiding it from me


For those who read it, here is a link to the original post from 2 days ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5gu19m/discovered_my_38_m_wife_38_f_of_17_years_has_been/

First, I'll start by apologizing again for the wall of text.  There's a lot here and it may not be interesting to some, but it's cathartic to me.  Second, before I start, I want to sincerely thank all those who commented on my post, but especially those who mentioned the iphone recovery software.  I owe you a huge debt - you're why Reddit is great.

Ok, we left off Monday night with her admitting to an emotional affair with another man for 1.5 years, but saying that was it.

After I posted on Reddit and people mentioned the iphone recovery software, I phoned to tell her not to use her phone and that I was going to recover the information later that night. She immediately admitted to sexting the other guy.

I got home and tried to run the software.  For whatever reason (probably human error), it didn't work well.  It only pulled up portions of 350 texts and none of them seemed relevant.  I decided not to pay $70 for the whole install and dropped the idea.

I went out with a friend (who had been the victim of adultery) for drinks at 7 to discuss and he thought I should give my wife a second chance, as long as she had never met the other guy.

I got home around 9:30.  She was sitting with her best friend in the sun room talking.  I said an awkward hi to the best friend (who I am sure knew) and went up to my office.  My wife came up 10 minutes later (when her friend had left) and immediately started yelling at me - telling me that I basically needed to get over it and that she wasn't going to feel like she had today for 6 months.  I kind of flipped out, noting that I had known for 30 hours (and was only receiving trickle truths during that period).  After we finished yelling at each other she left (she went into my daughter's bedroom to comfort her - I assumed she left to text the other guy) and I finished up my work and went to bed in the guest room.

I woke up about 1:30.  I went into the master bedroom and grabbed her phone.  I scrolled through the texts and emails, but there was almost nothing there as anything older than a day or so had been deleted.  I felt horrible.  I felt like I needed to be able to trust her, but continued to firmly believe she was lying to me and that there were things she wasn't telling me.

I put the phone back in her room and then went back into the office.  I googled iphone recovery software and saw a couple results that looked interesting.  I went back into the room and grabbed her phone again.  This time she woke up and followed me into the office.  I paid more attention to the software this time.  I turned the phone into airplane mode, I disabled iTunes autosync, I closed all the programs, etc.  I ran the free test and it came back with 3,500 results, the sixth of which was from the other guy.  I paid the $50 for the software and ran the full program.  It took about 10 minutes, during which she continually tried to convince me not to look at it.

Once I had the results, I started going through the texts.  The good news was that there was nothing that suggested she and the other guy met.  I had been in Europe from Monday through Thursday of last week and there were lots of recent texts.  A lot of them were sexual, but none suggested they were meeting.

Which gets to the bad news.  I asked when they started sexting - she said October.  I looked through the texts (they're not really organized by name just file size, so you kind of have to look through all of them) and found one from July.  It was clearly from someone else anyway (the style was very different) and was very sexually forward (I can't wait to see you naked, I'll wear anything you want, etc.).  There was also discussion of meeting up.

So she trickle truthed meeting up with 2 other guys from Craigslist.  She said she ""fooled around with"" one of them, but that they met at a park, so they didn't have sex.

At that point, I honestly felt like a huge weight had been taken off my shoulders.  All of the doubt that I could trust her again became irrelevant and I knew I could move on with a clean conscience.

Later that night, she trickle truthed sleeping with the other Craigslist guy (one time).  Last night she admitted to sleeping with another guy in Alaska when she went there alone on vacation a year and a half ago.  I do believe her that she didn't meet the guy she was texting continuously given the texts I read (although given the way the texts were progressing, I firmly believe it would have happened eventually) and that nothing seemed to happen when I was out of town for a week, but it doesn't really matter now.

You can guess the postscript.  She's been crying her eyes out and begging me to give her another chance.  I plan on sticking together through the holidays for the sake of the kids, but will be moving out come January.

tl;dr**: Wife has been cheating on me.  Thanks to reddit, I busted her."
"My [30f] wife is trying to keep me [29m] away from her gym break up party


This weekend coming up is my wife's gym break up party, in which they all get drunk and celebrate being fit and shit. They held one of these events just over 2 months ago, and I attended with my wife and her friends, the night was a standard drunk night out, we all had fun. Her friend did keep making fun of my wife for having a crush on her 'The Rock' lookalike personal trainer though.



These jokes didn't bother me on the night, and I even joined in myself. It wasn't until the next few weeks, my wife claimed to be going to some free PT sessions to help train one of the new ones. I believed her at the start, until week 2 or 3 I noticed withdrawals from our account of the exact amount a PT session with The Rock would cost, taken out about 10 minutes before she was due to start.  I also noticed her texting him later on those days, either saying thanks or booking the next weeks.



I have no idea why she needed to lie about these, but it happened anyway.  It wasn't until I was doing our tax, I questioned her on the withdrawals, but she still claimed they were free.  At this point I also suggested he was a rip off, as $80 for one hour of training is a lot of money.  This resulted in her not really talking to me for 3-4 days (lol).



When she began talking to me again, I was told she was changing to 'group training' which was half the price of a 1 on 1.  I seemed happy with this, until I noticed the same amount of money being taken from the account, or a build up of withdrawals during the week to cover a 1 on 1 session. I've let this ride until this week, which is now her break up party.



I asked last week what the go was, what time and where we are going etc.  She said she was bringing a girlfriend who went last time, and that she wanted to catch up with her at the break up party, and pretty much uninviting me from the event. 



This is where I unfortunately checked her iPad with her messenger open, and checked out the chat between my wife and her friend.  The main parts I got from this conversation were that my wife was one of her PTs favourite clients and that she had been invited to predrinks at his house, her friend also offered to be her 'wingman' so she could chase The Rock on the dance floor later in the night. So this is why I was uninvited I guess.  



I don't really want this to become about me checking through her messages, but I will if I have to. I don't think she is cheating, he has a lot of girls chasing him looking at his insta, and I don't know why he'd bother with a married woman.



Part of me wants to leave this be, part of me wants to confront. Any advice on how to approach this?

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5alqz3/my_boyfriend_29m_of_6_years_cheated_on_me_26f_he/


I got a couple messages asking how its going so I thought I would write a quick update on the situation. Before, I start I just want to thank everyone for all the really kind messages – at the time it felt really nice to be reassured by total strangers that it would be ok.


I left him and I am currently staying with my parents. It’s not an ideal situation because they live ~3 hours away and me and my mom do not have a great relationship. But I am super grateful that they are helping me out as I couldn’t have done this without them. My son is in pre-k a couple days a week now and I have got a part-time job in a hotel. 


It is hopefully not permanent - I’m planning to get my own place. I think my parents would rather help with rent then actually have me live them with them as it puts less strain on them and will stop me and my mom killing each other. In the long-term I would like to finish school but we will see what happens. 


So my ex. When I left, he was calling me all the time begging me to come back, apologising etc. One day I went back to get some of my stuff and when I got in he was really aggressive with me, asking why I was there and wouldn’t let me past the door. I pushed past him and the reason he didn’t want me there was because she was there. So the whole time he was begging me to come back and telling me it was over with her, was a total lie.


Honestly, it made it a whole lot easier for me to leave him when I realized he wasn’t sorry at all. I originally had this idea we could be amicable because of our son but I don’t think that’s going to happen. He has said some really hurtful things to me and I’ve probably said things to him I shouldn’t have. We have at least kind of arranged visitation/child support but I think we will maybe need to see a lawyer, especially if my relationship with him deteriorates even more


Overall, things are ok. It’s not been easy but I am just grateful we have some kind of stability over Christmas. In the new year I plan to really do this by myself but I want my son to have a good Christmas as he will probably this year so I don’t want to make any more big changes until then.

My wife and I are from conservative cultures but we are not having grown up in Australia. We dated for 6 months (short I know) and then got married 3 years ago. 

My daughter was born and I can honestly say it was the best day of my life. I've always wanted to be a dad. 

When my wife decided to go back to work after a year off, I took 3 months off (2 paid from saving up and 1 unpaid). My daughter is a complete daddy's girl. When she's sick, she'll cling to me more than her mum, I take her everywhere especially on weekends, I do her hair, give her a bath when I get home on time, change diapers, dress her, play dolls or whatever she wants- you know be a parent.

The problem is my wife's family. Traditionally the men do NONE of the child rearing especially when it's a daughter. As a result my wife is not close with her dad. 

Then there was the comments when my daughter was born- the ""better luck next time"", ""maybe you'll get a son next time"". I lost my temper and told my in-laws they couldn't visit and see my daughter with that attitude but my wife was exhausted from labour etc and didn't want trouble so I told my in-laws they could visit as long as they kept their trap shut.

Now they made/make fun of me for changing her diapers, combing her hair and when I was wearing a baby sling with her in it, they made fun of that too. 

On top of that- and this is really what kills me- they keep asking when we're having the next one so that we can try for sons. They want us to do certain prayers and stuff to increase the chances of a boy. They also consult some quack traditional herbal remedy moron to give us foods and rituals to increase the chance of a boy. 

I really want to cut them out and I'm this close to issuing an ultimatum to my wife over it.

My wife keeps begging me be more patient because it's how they were raised, they're not used to it- and they don't listen to her when she does speak up. 

I feel like we need to do more to protect our daughter but she still wants her family. 

I wouldn't care that they made fun of me if they didn't think my daughter was less because of her gender. It's vile. I'm almost contemplating divorce over it just to get my daughter away from them.

"I [21 F] want a guinea pig, my boyfriend [21 M] doesn't want one. We live separately. What do I do?


First of all, I feel like I'm being pretty whiny and a bit bitchy about this all, but I want to know how others view this. (I had a messed up childhood so lots of times I don't know if I'm being reasonable ore not).

My boyfriend, Peter (not his real name) loves playing video games, A LOT. I spend most of my time after school at his house. We pretty much never go over to my house, because my bed isn't that comfy (it really isn't) and his computer isn't there. Also, his house doesn't allow pets so the piggies would be living at my house. 

 Anyways, I've been wanting a guinea pig for AGES. I had them as a kid, I've had bunnies, I know how to take care of them. My roommates are okay with me having a piggie or two, as long as they get to have free cuddles and they get to name them. My boyfriends argument for me not getting them is that I wouldn't be spending much time at his place because of this. However, he plays HOURS upon HOURS of video games and wants me there while he plays. This makes me SO annoyed, because I don't have much to do and want to do my own thing. If I have plans with friends, then all is good, but I just HATE spending time in his room while he's playing games. He doesn't want me to leave and go to my place if he does. He also rarely makes plans with his friends. I know it's a hobby, and I know he loves it. I know he's allowed to play them and its not a biggie, but it still bugs me because I feel like I can't do anything but watch Netflix and sew (and who want's to do that for 3-6 hours a day?).  I think having piggies will help me mentally, would give me things to do while he goes playing his games and wouldn't make me angry at him all the time and we only live down the street from one another. I could take care of them and spend time with them while he plays games. I think this makes perfect sense, but he wants me with him 24/7...even if he's not spending quality time with me and vice versa. 

Pretty much I feel like I'm always waiting for him to be free from his video games and it makes me antsy and frustrated and I KNOW that just going down the block and spending time with the guinea pigs would make it all work out for me. He also tend to blame me (unless he's actually played for over 6 hours) for being annoyed when he plays. 

I just thinks this would solve everything, give me a bit more time to be my own person and not have me be annoyed with him when he plays games. How do I convince him that we would still be speniding time together, even if I were to have piggies? Should I just go get them without debating it more with him? Am I overreacting? What do I do? 
  
Thank you!

He is unaware of what has happened because my BIL is not telling his family yet. How do I handle this? It's going to be awkward to be around my BIL going through a divorce.

"My boyfriend [22m of 8 months] suddenly started smelling like.... ammonia?! What do I do?


My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now. We are both in our 20s and attend the same college.

When we started dating I loved his scent, he just smelled like a guy, nothing strange or abnormal about it (and no I was not, and have never been on hormonal birth control or hormones of any sort, and I am not pregnant).

A few weeks ago he suddenly started smelling like ammonia! Sometimes more strongly than others. I first noticed it when he came over for a night and hugged me. I thought that maybe he was using a new, weird lotion or had been to a friend's who has a cat (but I don't think any of his friends own a cat...). The smell wasn't offensive in the way that others can be, but I definitely found it unpleasant.

Later on that week it was either gone, or fainter.

Then, I slept over at his place this time. Normally his room smells fine. The smell was really strong! His room has a general guy funk and weed smell, but he was the only thing in there that smelled like ammonia. Now my hair smells like if from sleeping next to him all night!

I asked my roommate if she could smell it and she said that it smelled like ammonia hair dye, but that it wasn't that strong on me.

The smell is not of cat pee or anything, but he smells like.. a clean litter box? I don't know!

I googled it and there are some possible medical conditions that can cause someone to smell like ammonia. I really don't know what it could be.. but I can't really stand this anymore.

It definitely isn't a hygiene issue because he showers every morning.

How do I address this with him? He's the kind of person that does t really think anything is a big deal and probably wouldn't take me seriously if I suggested that there could be a medical reason.

I need to do something asap because it's really hard to kiss him and/or stay the night!



**EDIT:** WOW. I did not expect this post to receive SO much attention. Thank you to everyone who commented. I didnt realize that it could be something as serious as what has been suggested, I still hope that it isn't. I will definitely talk to him.

**tldr:** my boyfriend randomly started smelling like ammonia and I don't know how to address the issue."
"My (25f) coworker (24m) no longer wants to be friends and is threatening me and demanding I pay him back for Christmas gifts


Hi everyone. Sorry if this is a bit long, I'm lost on how to proceed with this situation, I'd really love your insight  .. I have worked at my job for about 6 months in an office above the warehouse for a large company. Not sure if this is relevant, but everyone in my office is older, ranging from 40-60+ 

I had been battling with an abusive ex boyfriend after breaking things off prior to working there, which I confided in one of the office ladies about (60f). She asked me one day if there was anyone in the warehouse I thought was cute or would consider dating, and I named John. She tracked him and got him number for me (without me asking). Her husband had worked very closely with John before retiring.

We end up texting, hanging out and kissed. I met with him later that week to explain I wasn't interested in dating and I needed to step back from whatever this was as my ex was still bothering me. We decided to be just friends. 

He asked if I'd like to do a Christmas gift exchange and I agreed, but only if we set up a price limit, which he said no don't worry about price. I figured $50 maximum! During that time I asked him to glance into a store window on his way home from work for a Himalayan Salt Lamp because I was pretty sure I had spotted them at that store. My plan was to wait to hear if they had them and drive out there to buy one for myself. I don't hear from him. He buys me a lamp for $45. I was bummed because I really wanted to pick my own out. I thanked him for it and told him I'd keep it as my Christmas gift. He said no it was a nice gesture from him.

He then bought me a $70 sweater online and got my name printed on the back of a hockey jersey as my Christmas gifts. So now I'm feeling like this has gotten out of hand. I barely know this guy and he's spending so much on gifts for me and I feel obligated to match the price on my gifts back. He tells me he'd also like a salt lamp $50 and a Blue Jays jersey $120

While all of this gift madness was going on, we had made plans to hang out after work one day. I started feeling sick and left work 3 hours early. He called me that night and told me he was coming to drop the lamp off for me, I tried to tell him no as I was sick, but he insisted. Literally would not take no for an answer. He invited me to his house last Saturday to watch his dad play music, but I had already made plans for a friend's bday. Then Friday comes along and we have plans to go for dinner. I get a call from my brother crying saying his girlfriend of 4 years broke up with him because she found out she can't have kids. I cancel plans with Johns to spend the night with my brother.

John tells me he's done trying to hang out with me because things keep coming up when we have plans aka me being sick and having prior commitments... I tell him I'm sorry and that if he doesn't want to be friends then I'll have to respect that. He gets upset that I'm preoccupied helping my brother and asks for the lamp back, then tells me to ""actually keep the stupid lamp"".. losing it over text.

Anyways... last night I miss his call. I text him ""busy what's up"" and he then tells me we need to talk. I respond saying there's nothing really left to say, and that I'd bring the lamp back on Monday. 

John: ""if you bring any tension or drama to work I will expose you, Your hoodie for Xmas just got processed so it's non-refundable now. There's a jersey I can't take back either. Could you get me a salt bowl and an Aaron Sanchez jersey like you promised?""

Me: ""John I'm trying to be nice and civil. Sorry it's gotten to this point. You asked me for the lamp back and I'm going to respect that and bring it on Monday.""

John: ""What the hell do I do with your other gifts I can not refund tho? Can you get me those things to offset it or pay me 160$ please?""

Guys... I barely know this person. I don't know what threatening to ""expose"" me even means. I looked up the return policy for the hoodie's website and he can request a return as it hasn't even shipped yet.
I think giving the lamp back is enough because he can return the sweater or regift it to one of his female friends? He's the one who said he's done trying to be my friend.... what the hell do I do?

**tl;dr my coworker got upset because I cancelled plans, told me to friends off, wants his gift back and for me to pay him for the Christmas gifts he got me** "
"I [F55] just met my boyfriend's [M55] ex girlfriend [F37] and I'm shattered.


Older than your average here, I'm sure, but my daughter suggested when I didn't want to delve into relationship details with her. Thanks for listening.

I'm a 55 yo divorced woman and I've been seeing my boyfriend ""Russ"" now for almost three years. We moved in together earlier this year. He's also divorced, I've met his ex wife and grown kids and no issues there, so this is why I'm stunned the ex girlfriend hit so hard.

Long story short, he started dating this woman ""Amber"" right as he separated from his wife. It's a little cloudy how that went down, friends of his saying the divorce was already happening, friends of hers saying Amber was the nail in the coffin. Anyway, they were a couple through the divorce and broke up a year or so after it became final when she moved to a neighboring city. Again, I'm a little fuzzy how the breakup went down. He says it was mutual, rumors say *she* left *him*.

I know they talk, he's never hidden that from me, but there's something about her that still carries this air of, I don't know, mystery. He's offered to introduce us when she comes to town but I've always avoided it. I don't know why.

So last night we all end up at a holiday event. Amber is there, in fact she texted Russ ahead of time to let him know she would see him there. He puts on the nicest suit he owns. Favorite tie. Cuts his hair that afternoon. For the hour we were there before she arrived he was scanning the room nonstop. Finally she shows and (of course!) she's ridiculous stunning. They weren't flirting by any conventional standard but the chemistry was running off of them. Maybe I'm being dramatic but they looked like the most connected couple in the room, not touching, just in sync?? To be fair, I watched her with other people that night and she's the type who can charm anyone in a conversation, but how my boyfriend looked after her was not like he's ever looked at me.

I feel like I'm the relationship he thinks he should have, but she's the one he CRAVES. 

I finally point blank asked a friend why they split and he said because the ex wife had the kids so convinced Amber caused the divorce that they wouldn't accept her and she refused to be in the middle of a ""pick me or pick the kids"" scenario. Now she's married, his kids have figured out the truth of sorts, and I feel like he regrets letting her walk away.

I don't want to leave because of another woman he'll obviously never get, but can I stay knowing I'm the second choice?
  
  **tl;dr**: My [F55] boyfriend [M55] obviously is still very much in love with his ex [F37]. He can't have her so I'm not worried about him cheating, but how do I get over knowing she was ""the one??"""
"My friend (29F) has never been in a relationship, crushes on people after one date and doesn't take no for an answer. Perpetually heartbroken, a little creepy and I don't know what to say as I listen to her problems.


Title is quite explanatory.

I have a friend, who is very loyal, fun to be with and mature in general. However, when it comes to men, she acts like she is a 12 year old fan girl.

She has never been in a relationship, which may partly explain her behavior. She would go on one date and is either a) not interested even remotely or b) completely in love. Lastly, she went on a date with a guy who she fell in love so deeply that she has been completely heartbroken and unable to function for the few months. She still cries at least once or twice a week. They went on two dates. On the second date the guy broke it off saying that he isn't feeling ""the thing"" but likes her as a person, nonetheless. She, on the other hand, felt that they had a connection beyond words. Then, I guess she got stuck in the ""but he likes me as a person???""-part.

So after this, she has a) stalked him everywhere, both online and IRL (eg looked at the events he goes to through FB and goes to the same events) b) blocked him, then unblocked him and apologized and blocked him again from everywhere c) tried to persuade him to give her a chance and then being pissed for him being such an asshole that won't give a chance to a nice girl like her, every time they ""bump"" into each other in these events. I guess she is pretty much the female version of ""Nice Guy"". Based what she's told me, he has always been cordial but she just goes nuts at him, after which he always apologizes for not feeling the same....

I like her for other reasons the what I've stated above (obviously), but I'm getting worried of her. She wants to have a family and all that jazz. Outside of this, she is really completely normal, she doesn't ""hate all men"", and she doesn't suffer from any other mental issues. She is actually very stable or so it would seem. But her behavior in the dating scene is completely off and scares people. Even with guys that have liked her back (in the beginning), she gets absolutely way ahead in the relationship (in her head) so the guy runs away. Hell, I'd be scared to date her.

Anyways, how could I gently communicate to her that a) I cannot listen to her heartbreaks because they make no sense b) her actions are direct reasons why she hasn't met anyone yet.


TL;DR: My friend is a Nice Girl."
"I [17F] will get a family tattoo once I get 18. Boyfriend [18M] doesn't want me to and is very upset that I will still want to do it.


We have a little family tradition that at 18 you'd get a special tattoo. Everyone in our family does it and I want to do it too. When I told my boyfriend about it, he said he doesn't like tattoos and he doesn't want me to do it. I explained that this is tradition and it's important to everyone in my family and I've been wanting to do it for a very long time but his response has been ""you don't care about what I think.""

And he's been distant ever since. We've been together for 1 year and we like each other. We didn't have any issues until now.

"My[28m] family[56f] [60m] [30f] is expecting expensive Christmas presents from me, yet have been condemning my lifestyle and my choice in women for the past 5 years.


 My family are first generation Indian immigrants. We came to America when I was 5 years old. I am letting you guys know this because of the cultural differences. In school I studied hard, and I ended up getting a very prestigious job in a great field. My older sister on the other hand, didn’t do that great, and now doesn’t make a lot of money. My father works as an administrator in a company (doesn’t make much), and my mom she now works as a tutor. 

For me, I followed my parent’s life style for a long time, and well I longed for more. While the whole Indian culture and work ethic was great for helping me reach a good job, it doesn’t do much beyond that, my social life especially was lacking. When I started making good money, I decided to make a lot of changes, I bought expensive clothes, went to a good hair cut place, joined a gym etc. And well I look a lot better than I did in college. 

Life for me, really started to change in a positive way. I already had a good income, and now I would say “above average looking” (not trying to be cocky). I did really well with women, and I have been really happy with my life style. I make more than 3x what my dad makes and more than 5x what my sister makes, so I have been the bread earner or so to speak for the family. For example, I come home and I see my parents are sharing 1 car, because the other is broken. I will go fix it. I pay for a lot of the family subscriptions, and I usually buy everyone expensive gifts for Holidays and Birthdays. 

However, my parents and sister have become extremely condescending towards my lifestyle, saying that I have betrayed our culture and a lot of stuff. Mainly this comes down to the fact that I tend to be attracted to White women. And honestly it seems to be a big point of contention. They have been extremely mean saying that I date White women because I am embarrassed of my culture. I think brown skin is bad so on and so forth. Really this is just insane. They bring up that before I was “cool”, I had Indian girlfriends and now that I am a big shot I forgot about women of my own race. 

MY family in a lot of ways is Americanized, and have loved a lot of parts about American culture, yet they seem to get angry at this one thing I do. I don’t see why it should matter. I feel as if my sister is the one spear heading this because she is upset because she hasn’t found a guy to settle down with yet, and somehow this is Indian men’s collective fault. 

They are all expecting me as usual to buy them nice gifts. I was thinking this year to buy them all just $50 Target gift cards. I am tired of being the son that does all this for his family but is despised by them. Is this a good or bad idea? Am I being fair here? 

 **Tl;Dr- I do a lot for my family, yet my family is angry and upset with me because I tend to date White women.**

"My [16F] boyfriend [16M] and his brother [17M] are well known football players around my school. They have a freshmen brother [14M] who comes here. The coach just called him ""The useless brother"" when he said he can't sign up because of his .


Hi, so I am on my phone at the moment. I'm currently at school. My school was having this weird thing for freshmen. It was like a information session on athletics. I don't know why of all times they chose to do it now. I was there talking about volleyball to some of the girls because that's what I play. 

Now I don't know what exactly is wrong with his brother, the medical name for it. But he broke his neck 2 years ago and had surgery preformed. You would never know anything was wrong with him when you look at him, he appears perfectly normal. It's when he's home you really start to see it. He just seems to have trouble doing things like putting shirts on and lifting heavy things. 

The Coach Mr. J walked up to him and asked is he signing up for Football in the future. I heard him say he has a bad neck and can't play football, doctor said under no circumstances. Which I also see around their home, his brothers are not rough with him like they are with each other. 

Mr. J then looked around I'm assuming to make sure no other teachers were there and said ""To bad, I had high hope for you. Guess you're the Useless brother"" and literally walked off. I just stood there and it's like did this dude actually just say that. 

He walked out and I assume he went home. He took his bag, did not listen to a word I said and left. 

I want to know what to do in this situation.

"Pregnant and handicapped sister [24F] upset I won't change my [20F] social life for her.


I have two siblings. I am closest with Mike [25M] who lives and works in Australia. He graduated at 17, went to community college, applied to an Australia university and has been there since. He is dating someone and they plan to get married in four years. I have been to see him twice since he moved 3 years ago. I absolutely love the area.

Mike and I were talking about some issues I am having with our half-sister Jen [24F] [same absent father, different mothers] and how I wanted to get away from town for a loooong time. He offered to let me stay with him if I wanted to take a year off. 

I worked it out and I leave in June. 

So here is the real issue and one I kind of want to work on before I leave. I feel like time away from Jen will be good for *both* of us, but I am not sure if this is true. Maybe I am hopeful the issue will solve itself magically while I am gone and I can return home without issues. 

Just to add: Mike and Jen do not really talk. Mike has pretty much limited their contact to every three months. 

---

*Background* 

Growing up, my Mom [45F] made a lot of effort to keep in touch with Jen's Mom Clara [50F] so Jen could be in our lives. It worked for the most part, I was close with Jen until 2015 when she was in a car accident. 

It has been almost two years and Jen has yet to accept she is likely handicapped. Or limited. I am not sure what the right word is, especially because Jen won't accept any implication she is not 100% at all times. This includes aggravating her issues by attempting to go for long walks. Then she has to call someone to pick her up and take her home, because she forgot her cane and refuses to admit she tried too hard. 

I am not even sure the full extent of everything because she clams up and doesn't talk. I know sometimes she can't get out of bed, her knee is fucked up. She was in a car accident because her boyfriend, at the time, decided to drive a car with bad breaks. So she has been through a lot. Her boyfriend [30M] was injured and broke up with her afterwards. He is fine now, he has no long standing issues [I know because Jen cried about it for months.] 

I am sorry if I am coming off rude about Jen. I had sympathy for her, until she started to blame me for everything. I go to the beach, she calls me to scream about how I never include her. I do anything and she turns it into a sign I don't love her. She wants to work out with me, but gets pissed off I want to do more than ten minutes of slow, painfully obnoxious conversation with her about how she doesn't have to do all the work I do to look hot. 

I work out a lot, I run, I hike, I go on long trips with friends. All of this makes Jen fume. She tries to ruin the trips by pretending she is hurting when she is not. I got played twice by that and now I don't even talk to her about anything. Even breathing pisses her off. 

I think she actually hates me for everything. I have a boyfriend, she hates me. I don't have a boyfriend, she hates me. I lose ten pounds, she hates me. I gain ten pounds, I look like a heffer and she still hates me. I am at a loss.

I don't know what to do with this. I hate her attitude and wish she would just stop calling me. But then I feel bad because she has driven everyone but her mother away. 

What do I do? 

**TL;DR** Injured sister is miserable I am happy and I am not sure if I end the relationship or not?

"My mother [51F] has decided that she wants another child. I [31F] worry that in the event of her death, there is no obvious person to care for it other than me. I am also planning to move away before too long.


My parents divorced after I was born, and my mother always wanted a second child. However, she was always looking for the right guy, and never found him. 

She recently announced during a dinner party at her home that she has been working with a fertility company and will be using a surrogate to carry a child.

Mom's only living relatives (other than myself) are in their 70s or older. Most of her friends are older than she is, as well. I do not have any siblings. In short, I believe that if something happened to her, I would be the obvious person to care for her child.

This concerns me because Mom has had a number of serious health issues including three hospitalizations and two surgeries in the past five years.  She has continuing health concerns.

I specifically do not want children myself, and I do not want to raise a child. While I hope that my mother will live many more decades, the reality exists that she is getting older and health concerns are likely to multiply.  My husband feels the same.

In addition, I suspect that even if her health is mostly good, raising a child will require some help.  I am not opposed to occasionally helping out, but I worry that the level of help may exceed what would be able to comfortably provide, especially because I don't expect to live in this area long-term. My husband's family lives in another state and we have discussed my requesting a transfer at my company so that he can take over his father's business within the next few years.  I can provide love and support from a distance at that point and travel back here for emergencies, but I won't be here on a regular basis.

I want mom to know that (a) she should have a plan for who will care for the child in the event that something happens to her, and (b) that she should have a plan for what to do if she needs day-to-day help.  (I have told her before that we expect to move out of the state at some point, but I don't know if it has crossed her mind with respect to this.  I also help her with day-to-day things now occasionally, so she may anticipate that will continue).

I believe I should tell her these things. However, I don't know how or when to have this conversation. I don't believe this would affect her decision to have a child, but I worry that she will take it negatively or see it as me being intentionally unsupportive.

  **tl;dr**: My mother is having another child. She is in her fifties, and I am the only logical person to take the child if something were to happen to her, but I do not want to have a child. I also plan to move away within a couple of years and worry that she may be expecting my day-to-day support long term, which I would then not be able to provide. I am not sure how to tell her these things (or if I should just not).

EDIT: I should add that I had already tried to discourage this and presented alternatives (this has been a topic of conversation for several years before she came to this conclusion), but it's her decision. Advice to convince her not to do this isn't really going to help me. You may be right, but it's her life and I can't prevent her from doing this."
