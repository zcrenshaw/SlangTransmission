"[UPDATE] How do I [32 MtF] say thank you to my (foster) parents for being so amazing?


Original here:

https://nr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5mb7li/how_do_i_32_mtf_say_thank_you_to_my_foster/

Sorry for not responding to any of the original comments. Reading the comments ended up being very emotional- full throat constricting, tears and I had to take breaks because I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the advice. 

I did take many people's advice and sort of made it my own.

I took a week off work and read /u/Palavras and /u/riendlymarmite suggestions in particular about a memory jar and childhood milestones. Thank you guys and everyone else who mentioned a letter/adoption etc. 

I ended up writing a journal that was addressed to them. Once I started I had a really hard time containing how I felt so the letter became quite long. So being the over the top person I am, I ended up on Pinterest, found a tutorial on making your own paper/ 101 book binding and basically wrote a mini journal/letter and then bound it. I also put photos in as well. 

I would post pictures but it's a bit unpolished.

I didn't want to commission art work or a quilt because I wanted to do it myself but my SO does embroidery and she says can do a little pixel persong a cross stitch portrait  so we're looking into that too - after our children enter the picture!

I gave them the journal last weekend. They spent Friday/Saturday reading it, we had a very emotional dinner on Saturday especially after I asked them about adult adoption and changing my surname. They were thrilled! They had thought about it too but didn't want to feel like they were taking something of my identity away or pressure me. Cue more tears to the point of my SO joking about gluing tissue boxes to her person. 

This has been a very dehydrating week. Thank you so much reddit, I am so glad I posted here! This was seriously an amazing experience.

"Update: My wife [30 F] has given up alcohol for good and I [31 M] am finding it difficult to deal with.


Today, I happened to stumble across this throwaway. Furthermore, I noticed that it happened to be the throwaway's cakeday so I think *someone* is prodding me to do an update on this!

I posted a year ago about how my wife had [given up alcohol for good and how I was finding it hard to deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40im59/my_wife_30_f_has_given_up_alcohol_for_good_and_i/).

I'd like to thank everyone that commented on the original thread. I did read everything even if I didn't reply to everyone. There were people who thought (as I expected) that I was selfish, that it shouldn't matter that my wife was making that decision and that I likely had my own hidden drinking problems. There were others, though, that understood and could see my point of view.

The TL/DR of my original post is that my wife had decided to give up alcohol for good, had told me she thought she was an alcoholic and so was going to quit. She was not an alcoholic in the 'traditional' sense i.e. she didn't get drunk all the time, wouldn't drink in the day but she did have two or three glasses of wine pretty much every evening after work. A lot of people do that. When she told me she was quitting booze for good, it was a complete shock to me and I felt a very real sense of loss. I really felt heartbroken because I felt like there would be things we would 'miss out' on in the future together - sharing cocktails by the pool on holiday, sharing a bottle of nice wine over a romantic candlelit dinner, popping a bottle of champagne on New Year's, toasting to our (currently non existent) children on their wedding days. I felt like that had all been taken away from me. I knew that this was small fry compared to what others went through and what she could be going through but that didn't stop it hurting. Everyone's problems matters to *them* even if an abstract observer can clearly see that one person's problems are much worse than anothers'.

When I googled for help and advice on the matter, nothing really came up so I want to keep my original post up and supply an update to let others that might go through the same thing that they're not alone.

As I mentioned above, some people were adament that my wife's decision to not drink ever again shouldn't affect me in the slightest. Basically, it had nothing to do with me and if I felt like it affected me then I had my own problems. A year on, I can defiantly tell those people that they are wrong. In a marriage, at least in the kind of marriage I believe in, you and your partner's actions and choices are intertwined. The whole point of a marriage is to *share* the rest of your lives together. I had expected and hoped for a long future together, sharing experiences that typically included alcohol. Our society, as a whole, is intertwined with booze. We first met when we were both tipsy at a student bar, pretty much all the social occasions we've ever been to have involved some alcohol - that's just where our society is. Drinking was, in some ways, a 'shared interest'. If you met a partner through rock climbing and you climbed together several times a week, got married, carried on climbing together all the time then suddenly your married partner said ""sorry, I'm never going to climb again"", you would feel hurt. Like something core to your relationship had been taken away.

So, what have I learnt in the past year? Well for one, your parter giving up booze really doesn't matter. You just adjust. I'd be lying if there were times that I miss us sharing a bottle of wine together but those thoughts are few and far between. It's far more important to me that she's happy and feels much better about herself. She's healthier, has a better outlook on life and when we are out togheter, we actually spend more 'quality' time together. I've never been a big drinker so if we were out, she'd get tipsier way before me so in a way, we weren't on the same conversation level by the end of the night. Now, we can talk 'properly' throughout. There are lots of benefits too, we spend much less on drinks now, of course - especially at home. We do, however, spend more on food. That's something I get more enjoyment from anyway though.

We've been on holiday, we've been to weddings, we've been out to loads of dinners, we've had Christmas together. It's all been fine. I always knew it would be - other people don't really judge much once you just say 'you don't drink'. As long as you don't make a big deal about it. My wife still doesn't tell people that she's an alcoholic; the story is still ""I gave up for dry January and found myself really liking it and felt better about myself so I gave it up for good"". It's just easier, makes less of an issue of it and draws much less attention. We're probably happier than we were before (although we were plenty happy then too). I love my wife and I love spending time with her.

For what it's worth, I do still drink. I didn't drink much before she gave up and now I do drink less. I'd share a bottle on nights out before but hardly ever drank at home. I'd say I had, on average, 2-3 units a week. Now I'm more at 0.5-1 units. I.e. Once every two or three weeks I might have a couple of beers. I hardly ever drink when we're out together. Only if I *really* fancy it. When I just 'quite fancy' it, I'd usually choose not to out of solidarity with my wife.

One change I have noticed is that I judge the shit out of restaurants that have a crappy soft drinks selection or lack of non-alcoholic cocktails. High end restaurants tend to have several great options and will go out of their way to cater to you. Other restaurants do seem to judge you for not getting a bottle of wine, likely because they make a healthy profit off of alchohol. Annoyingly, we're not doing it because we want to be 'cheap', we'd happily pay for an overpriced mocktail that's basically just tonic water with a cucumber in. I do enjoy being 'prepared' for my wife now though - i.e. if we're at a function where they're handing out champagne and nothing else, I will do what I can to get her something else; I'll happily be a bit of an arsehole if a place hasn't thought about providing non alcoholic drinks. There are plenty of people that can't drink for a number of reasons after all - religion, health pregnancy etc. Places really should be prepared.

I've rambled on for a while here, it's a bit disjointed as I wasn't planning on spending loads of my day writing about this! I'll happily answer any questions others may have. What with it being 'Dry January' for a lot of people, this could be something others might be thinking about.

I'd like to thank a few people from the original post for their comments; /u/gravityline and /u/Spectrum2081 for making me realise that it could have been a *lot* worse, she could have opted to go vegan instead which would have been bloody *awful*. u/lofwt and u/ShelfLifeInc for their points of view as non/little drinkers and for giving substitute suggestions. Also u/gooberfaced for saying that our life probably lacked any 'real' problems. That really made me laugh and see the truth in it!! There are many more that commented and helped in my original post but I can't list them all. Oh, also a shout out to r/stopdrinking; I got my wife to sign up to reddit for that sub and she's found it really helpful several times over the past year. :)

TL/DR: My wife decided a year ago that she was quitting alcohol for good as she felt she was an alchoholic. This was a shock for me, I didn't think she was and I felt feelings of loss at the thought of a future where we wouldn't drink occasionally togehter. A year on, everything's been fine, we're happier, she's healthier and still doesn't drink. It hasn't been a big deal. I still feel some feelings of loss but they're so insignificant now and I realise that. Life is great."
"UPDATE: I [23f] really like a coworker [23m] but can't tell if he's just friendly


Hey! This didn't get a ton of attention or anything but I'm updating anyways.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54tq2d/i_23f_really_like_a_coworker_23m_but_cant_tell_if/

Original post above! Tl;dr my cute coworker and me, wasn't sure if he liked me and if it was appropriate to ask him.

So over time I still liked him but had moved out of the intense crush phase. It didn't seem like he was interested. It made me a little sad, but wasn't devastating or anything. Still would have been over the moon if he had just spontaneously asked me out, but it wasn't as much on my mind anymore.

So we were hanging out and talking about another coworker/friend, who just started officially dating a guy she had been casually seeing. (Not trash talk, just like ""wonder how it's going!"") I had already told him about my past relationship, and he had alluded to dating people in the past but very much in passing and with an air of not wanting to elaborate, so I hadn't asked. But we are fairly close friends now, so I figured I'd ask him directly since I felt sure he would just tell me if he didn't want to talk about it.

To my surprise, he's actually dating a ""friend"" from college he's told me about in the past (i actually met him once at a lecture we went to after work)! The only reason I say I'm surprised was that for some reason I thought my coworker had said that this friend had a girlfriend. But it turned out I had just gotten confused about which friend he was talking about. But the second he said it, everything made much more sense. He and the friend (actually boyfriend!) went to lunch every now and then during the workday since we all work near each other...I thought it was sweet that they had such a tight friendship but it's even cuter now that I know they just have a really close relationship!

I'll admit there was a part of me that was a tiny bit sad when he first told me, but I'm being totally honest when I say that that only lasted for a moment. I'm queer as well, so we had a really good heart to heart (he had pinged my ""gaydar"" as being queer, but wasn't sure if he was bi or whatnot), and honestly I feel like we're closer now than ever now, but with none of those butterflies in my stomach from earlier, just really honest friendship.

Also, we have another gay coworker and friend who is very flamboyant and we are planning on trolling him by telling him he no longer has the gayest study in this lab (we're scientists). His face will be amazing.


Tl;dr he's gay and in a really cute relationship, and we are bros



EDITED: fixed some typos/minor grammatical errors for clarity.

Also, I truly did not expect this level of response! My original post had a couple of comments, but I wanted to share this anyway, since it's interesting that this is one of those times when I had a sudden paradigm shift, and also an example of a situation not ending in a ""good"" way (ie, oh he likes me and we're dating!), but in a way that's actually somehow better (great bonding moment with a friend). I'm touched so many of you have responded to this with your stories and support. Thanks!"

"Me [26 F] with my husband [27 M] wants to have a baby together, but won't drive


This may be a little weird? I don't know, I'm just looking for some advice on the issue. 

My husband grew up in a city environment, and never had to learn how to drive. I did when I was younger. When we started dating, I had to drive everywhere, which wasn't a big deal at the time and he always said he wanted to start sometime.

Now that we're married, I have to do EVERYTHING. Drive to friends houses, to the gym, get groceries, basically everything and I'm getting irritated. Now we're talking having kids, and I don't want to be the only one that drives in the house. What if the baby has an emergency and I'm not around? I hate having him dependent on me getting anywhere.

He says he doesn't want to start driving in case he kills anyone while driving, and he's scared of it. Which I do understand, but he hasn't even tried being behind the wheel! I don't know what to do, this has been our biggest argument lasting months. Can anyone give me advice? Anyone with kids where one spouse can't drive?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband and I want to start having kids, but not until he starts driving. He doesn't want to drive, says it doesn't matter if he can drive. Idk what to do.

EDIT: Hi everyone! I just woke up and will try to respond to you guys, thank you for all the advice! It really has been half people agreeing with me and half people siding with my husband, so at least I got to see the other side of things, haha. I showed him some comments on here and he agreed so take driving classes, if he is super scared he'll see someone about the anxiety, and I'm taking him on a golf course soon to help practice! And people asking if he can use public transport, where I live it's basically walk, drive or bike. So really not an option. Thanks everyone for your stories, really helped solve the situation :)"
"My (25/F) boyfriend (28/M) of five months spent the night at his ex's house.


They were together on/off for three years and they broke up officially around this time last year. I'm still friends with one of my exes, so I didn't really think anything of it  when he told me he was still friends with one of his. They don't hang out alone, they only hang out with their close knit group of friends. I've met them all and they're really nice people. I've never had any reason to doubt anything he's told me. He has been cheated on (by this particular ex) and it really shook him up, otherwise they'd probably still be together, so I don't think he would ever cheat on me or anyone else. He's just not coded that way. 

That said, he and I were supposed to hang out last night after work but I couldn't get a hold of him. His phone was either turned off or the battery was dead. Either way, my night was put on hold for *hours* until I finally decided to just eat out by myself. I was already dressed and ready to go, so I just left, grabbed some pho by myself and came home to find zero texts/calls from him. I left my phone at home by accident. He didn't get back to me, nor did he stop by the apartment, according to my roommate. 

On a whim, I popped onto IG to see what he was doing, if he had posted anything that day. I was partially worried that something bad had happened to him, and partially suspicious. I've never had any reason to feel suspicious of him before. As I scrolled through IG, however, I noticed that his ex had posted something. For whatever reason I follow her and she follows me. The photo was taken at his favourite restaurant. She took a photo of her dessert, and you can clearly see him in the background, seated across from her, his elbows on the table. 

She made the post hours before he and I were supposed to hang out. And in the image description she mentions having a movie night ... *with him*. One of their friends (whom I've grown close to) commented on the photo with a question mark. There was no reply. 

I was kind of numb at that point. I wasn't sure what any of it meant, but I knew he was doing something he shouldn't have been, and that he had blown me off in the process. Again, this was completely unlike him. It could have been that he had simply forgotten our plans. We organized it a week prior, which is long enough to forget. That said, I'm his girlfriend. He should remember. He should at least make sure he's reachable. 

I went to bed last night feeling sick with worry, and then when I woke up this morning, I found five texts from him saying the following:

""Hey, I'm so sorry! I forgot we had plans.""

""Cathy and I marathoned Westworld and I fell asleep. My phone died. I'm an idiot. Please forgive me."" 

""How about I pick you up tonight and we go to that new sushi place on Main?""

""Just you and I.""

""I love you."" 

I don't really know what to think. He has always made a point to never hang out with her alone. He hasn't made any promises to me in any explicit words, but when he and I first got together, he told me things between him and Cathy were completely finished, and that he had no desire to hang out with her alone anymore. He said the only reason they still *occasionally* see each other is because they're part of the same social circle. It's the same with my ex and I, except I've never hung out with him one on one post-breakup, and I don't plan on it. 

I replied back asking if anything happened between them and he said, ""No, of course not. I would never do that to you."" 

But he would make himself unavailable for hours without even thinking to say hi to me all day? Our plans were for eight o'clock. Unless he's had a rough day at work, he usually stays up much later than that, except he didn't have work yesterday, so I don't understand how he would magically fall asleep so early in the night. 

I trust him, but at the same time, I feel betrayed.

**tl;dr** He forgot we made plans, and instead hung out with her alone. They were apparently maraonthing a tv show, and he fell asleep there by mistake. His phone was dead according to him, and that's why I was unable to reach him. He has never given me any reason not to trust him in the past. He told me nothing happened, but this whole situation still looks really bad.

Throwaway because I know some of the people involved use Reddit. This is a very weird story and I'm sorry for that, but I'm going to try and elaborate as best as I can. I just want this to be over. 

My boyfriend was shot and killed a week ago. We had been together for 3 years. I will absolutely admit that our relationship was not perfect. About a year in, he began to severely emotionally and mentally abuse me. He had a mental illness and would not treat it. I do not know why I stayed with him. Nevertheless, his loss hit me very hard. It was sudden and tragic and, being close to his family, I wanted to be there for them. 

I few days ago, I was contacted by three different girls who claim to have slept with my boyfriend while we were together. They all claimed to not know I ever existed. They provided photo evidence. I always knew he was cheating on me in the back of my mind, but the revelation of these facts after his passing has been devastating for me. I thanked all the girls for their honesty and then blocked them on social media. I didn't want to see them anymore, nor did I think they needed to see him. I want to put this entire chapter of my life behind myself. Only one of the girls, ""R"", acted kind of hostile toward me. I messaged back to her nothing but ""fuck off"" and blocked her. That was it. 

I then started receiving harassing, cruel messages from fake Twitter accounts. The messages claimed my boyfriend and I were NEVER together and that I'm merely seeking attention (I was in his sister's wedding... I was in his obituary... All of his friends know me... He simply lied to these girls in particular). They attacked me personally, including my line of work and the school I agree. The wording and insults were almost exactly like the ones R had thrown at me. I did not respond, blocked all the accounts, and set my Twitter to private. I then messaged one of my boyfriend's friends, ""H"", who knows her slightly, and asked that he please tell her to stop. I just want to be left alone. I unplugged from all social media. 

The messages stopped. But now H has contacted me saying that R's mother has been speaking to her (???) and that R is being threatened and harassed online. R is accusing me of doing this, but I haven't had any words with her since I blocked her actual account. R showed her mother the ""fuck off"" message and said that I'm a danger to her daughter. R's father evidently works in the police department and says he will track my IP address and prove the messages are from me (they absolutely are not) and will have me arrested. R told H that even without proof, I will be at least reprimanded because her dad can ""pull strings"" (????)

I just want to grieve in peace. I don't understand why this needs to continue and I never ever tried to initiate any kind of conflict. I want to move on with my life and from this terrible relationship I was in. Now I'm nervous about police showing up at my door. How can I mediate this situation?? I've tried ignoring it, but it does nothing to stop it. 

Edit: I'm so sorry. I forgot to mention that his family found out about the infidelity and kindly ask that she not attend the viewing. She did so anyway, high, and with a group of friends. They laughed at his casket and were asked to leave. The harassment began after this. 

**TL;DR: My late boyfriend cheated on me. The other girl is now threatening me with police action for 'threatening messages' that were absolutely not sent by me. How to proceed?**

"UPDATE!! I (21F) feel like my roommate (23M) is trying to take my dogs for himself?


ORIGINAL: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ow0hm/i_21f_feel_like_my_roommate_23m_is_trying_to_take/

Hello everyone! Firstly I want to say thank you so much for all your help. I read very single one of your comments and I couldn't believe how great all the advice I was getting was! So thank you all so much.

I spoke to Max yesterday. I tried to keep things calm before immediately moving out because I was afraid of making an irrational decision. My BF gave me the go ahead for me to move in with him, and it seems like in the next few months that could be a possibility - YAY.

I talked thinks over with Max and explained, thoroughly, why certain things he was doing were not okay and why I wasn't allowing him to do them. For example, I explained all about why he shouldn't be walking my dogs (they try to get away, they pull a lot, and they're just very energetic) and he understood. After speaking for him for a few hours I could tell he was just genuinely interested in my dogs and asking a ton of questions about pretty much all breeds and what it's like to own a dog. At first I felt very paranoid and thought OH SHIT he wants to steal my doggies! But that wasn't the case, obviously.

As some of you pointed out, he just apparently really wants a dog for himself. I then went on to explain the basics and how it really isn't easy nor is it always fun, but he's still saying he just really wants his own dog and that's why he was 'smothering' mine. I guess it makes sense, but I'm a little worried. I'm not sure Max would be such a great dog owner right now.

SOO, I told him if he's serious about all this and he really does want a dog and won't be giving up after a year, I said I'd help him get into dog-owning so he doesn't go in on his own and clueless. I've decided to give him 'classes' where we can practise important things that he'll need to do with his own dog. I said the dogs for now will still be locked in my room and garden while I'm out because I'm not 100% trusting of him just yet, but when I get home some evenings we'll be doing some training.

I'll be teaching him how to walk them, how to clean up after them, bathe them, what food to buy and how to know, how to play with them and how to properly call them if he wants their attention. I also advised him not to get huskies as a first pet because they can be tough (some of you will know!) and I'd much rather him have a smaller dog which will be easier to take care of. If you have any recommendations on small, easier dogs to care for, Max and I would appreciate it. Though he's got his heart set on a Westie.
I guess that's it for now! Tomorrow we'll be walking my doggies together and I'll be teaching him the DOs and DONTs until he decides he's ready for his own pet. At first I was incredibly apprehensive when he told me he wants his own dog, but I'm no one to stop him and it seems like he does really, really want one. He's been searching up dog breeds on Google and spending hours researching on which breed he'd like.

That's it for now, guys! If you still have any advice I'd really appreciate it. I'm not expert in training so we could all use some help! 😛

Thank you, Reddit!!

TLDR - I'm going to prepare Max for getting his own dog, since that's what he's wanted since the very beginning and that's why he's been smothering my dogs, apparently. I feel worried for him, so I'm going to try my hardest to make sure he can be the perfect dog owner. I'll be giving him daily lessons on DOs and DONTs. I also explained in depth why everything he was doing with my dogs was not okay. He seems to understand now."

"Me [26 F] with my now ex-fiance [26 M] after being together over 10 years; any very long-term relationship breakup survivors out there? [breakups]


My ex-fiancé and I started dating in high school. Our values and dreams always seemed to align, even way back then. We went to different colleges, had rough patches here and there, but always knew we wanted to end up together. We saw the distance as integral to us being independent people coming together as a team. We took jobs in separate states after college for a year, but then moved in together and have been living together ever since (3+ years). 

He was my best friend. We fought here and there, but always had fun goofing around, traveling, and being creative together. We talked about being married, growing old together, having a bunch of kids. We weren't in a hurry for any of it, just excited knowing that could be the future. 

I lost my full-time job in March 2015, later finding out that undiagnosed ADHD was the mystical curveball that had been causing a rift in my productiveness throughout grade school and office jobs. I struggled through applying to many many jobs before settling for a couple part-time positions until I found something full-time. He was always supportive, but I could sense that he wasn't proud of my career (or lack thereof) anymore. Eventually the fall rolls around and I have two promising job interview processes in the works. We're both excited.

He proposed November 2015, we were thrilled, families were thrilled, friends were thrilled. It felt natural and right. I got two job offers shortly after, and started a new and great full-time position in January 2016.

I got to planning the wedding. He didn't have as much input as I thought he might, knowing how creative he is, but I attributed that to a general disinterest in wedding planning.

We fought as often as most couples fight. The fights were often about his increasing lack of communication. Sensing that wall between us, and coming from a loud family, I tended to raise my voice during arguments. This was a natural but bad reaction. This caused him, coming from a family that does not talk about feelings, to shut down more. It was a vicious cycle. 

He kept shutting down more and more. And I kept trying and trying to get him to open up. His business trips got longer and more frequent, going from 25%-50% travel. I would say I missed him when he was gone, to which he would respond "" you know i'm doing this for our future so I don't have to travel as much then."" His workdays got longer, no longer waking up for a morning cuddle session or to play with the dogs, but waking up and immediately heading to the computer or phone. Working, texting, calling until 9 or 10pm at night. 

I couldn't hold his attention for longer than a minute at times. I would be interrupted mid-sentence during our only conversation of the day by him answering a phone call, only for him to forget he was talking to me and never come back to finish the conversation. Every time I tried to talk to him about these concerns, I got ""I am too busy to talk about this now."" So I would bottle them up and  we would never find time and they would eventually come out as a yell during a fight. 

But I was still holding on to what we were before the engagement, and onto all the dreams we shared for the future. He proposed after all, we had talked about getting married for years and years. He knew I and our families were planning our wedding. I attributed a lot of the fights to the stress of wedding planning. Everyone said it would be stressful. 

The last two months he was home for probably a total of ~10 days. We went to our hometown for Christmas and my family noted that he seemed disconnected and off, but didn't say anything until present time, after the fact. 

Before New Year's, I drove to a nearby city where his company was having a conference. We goofed around during the day together, having fun like we hadn't had in a while. Later in the evening we have beers with his coworkers. I sense something happening with one of his coworkers. Being drunk, I addressed it in a not-so-sensitive way. We fight. He makes me feel immense guilt for accusing him of emotionally cheating. We fight badly. He confesses that he is not happy, he doesn't want this wedding and he didn't even want to propose. I am floored. I drive home the next morning not knowing how to process. He says he'll be home in a day and we can talk.

For me, I saw this as the time we finally sit down and talk through these issues, plan for some counseling, bridge that connection again. But he tells me he doesn't know if he even wants to try. He doesn't see me as his best friend, and he doesn't know if he's in love. He keeps saying, ""I just want something extraordinary."" I can't understand why he can't see that we were extraordinary, we can be extraordinary if we get over this hump.

Two weeks go by of him not knowing if he wants to try. Saying things like ""I'm not sure I believe that there's happiness down the path with you."" 

And then I find out that he has feelings for his coworker. The one he guilted me over. I tell him it's done and NC when he tells me that his coworker asked him on a date and he wanted to go. Via text message, because he doesn't want to say it over the phone. He says  that he's too scared of my love for him, because he can't give it back. He goes on a date with her the night of our breakup. 

The past few days I have been feeling the full gamut of grief stages. Lots of disbelief, lots of anger, lots of sadness. I'm living on a twin mattress at my sister's apartment with 1 of what were our 2 dogs, dreading going back to the home we shared to try to figure out what's supposed to be mine. 

I don't know where to go. I have never felt so lost. I sobbed so hard during my commute today that my stomach cramped up for an hour. I'm not sure if i have a very specific question, I just want someone to relate with. Is there anyone out there? Advice for getting over my love for someone who apparently got over me so long ago?

If you read through all of this, thank you. It became somewhat of a venting session.

"My(25m) dad(50m) is angry with me for wanting to change my last name.


I'm the child of a white father and a black mother(49f). My dad's parents never approved of my parents' marriage and they've never been shy about it. They're pretty well off and a little stuck up in my opinion. They always felt that he married way beneath him and could've done a lot better. I remember as a child how my cousins on my dad's side would get all these cool birthday and Christmas presents from the grandparents and we(myself and older sister(26f)) would get nothing. One of my older cousins actually convinced me as a child that he too was born mixed race like me and he spent a full day in the bath tub and emerged white. So desperate to fit in I was at the time, I actually did what he said and needless to say, it didn't work. I laugh about it in retrospect though.  Every time we'd spend time at my dad's parents' place the vibe would always be extremely cold. Like they were just tolerating us instead of loving us as their grandchildren. There is an old family photo album in their house with some really old pictures of some ancestors who were slave owners. 

As we got older, we spent less and less time with my paternal grandparents and more and more with my mom's side of the family. My mom's parents are the coolest people I know. All the grandkids loved (and still do) it there. They've taught me the true meaning of love and family.

For the reasons stated above, I've decided that I want to change my last name to my mom's maden surname. I sat my parents down and told them this yesterday and it hasn't gone down well with my dad at all. He's incredibly upset with me and hasn't spoken to me since I broke the news. I tried to explain that I'm my own man now and I want to have my own identity that I feel comfortable with but he refuses to see this. I love this man with all my heart but I feel so strongly about changing my name just because I detest everything that those who we've inherited it from stand/stood for. I'm not going to back down from this but I also don't want to fall out with my dad. I feel like I'm standing between a rock and a hard place right now. Is there anyway I can have this cake and eat it at the same time?

So i'm seeing this older guy and earlier this week he says he might want to hang out sunday night (today) and I said cool. I got off of work at 6:30 pm today and he never mentions hanging out so I don't think anything about it and take a shower and lay in bed when he knocks on my door.

Girls. This is a new man and you have no makeup on, your apartment is a disaster and you're wearing just a towel with a hair bun. I open the door tell him i'll be 30 minutes then close the door. So he's pissed I left him outside (he left because of it) and i'm pissed i can't get a 10 minute heads up call. I work and go to school and my apartment reflects that and its embarrassing to have company over so when i do I clean up. 

Also, he's been cheated on before and makes a point to always check over my shoulder when i text and now he's showing up announced probably to test me. Give it to me straight.

"I (M28) asked for a raise at my company before the holidays and received a much larger one than expected. Now interactions with my bosses and higher level employees (M&amp;F 40+) are very awkward.


I have been at my company for 4 1/2 years now (in a professional construction-based field). I enjoy the work, but at times it can get very boring. For the past 2+ years I have really been busting my ass and working hard and long hours (~10hr days, more than 90% of my company) mainly because I am a perfectionist and everything has to be done exactly right. However, before that, for about 8 months, I was in a huge slump and not very productive. This was because I felt slighted for several projects I had been passed over to work on, and had been basically farmed out to other areas of my company to jump around to help them complete these irrational deadlines each week. This lack of productivity (which I personally acknowledged) was brought to my attention by my boss, and I shaped up. Like I said, now (for the past 2+ years) I really get stuff done and am on top of my game.

Before the holidays I requested a meeting with our HR director to discuss a possible raise because I have been getting lots of offers from other companies, as well as getting hints from my colleagues that I am probably underpaid for the vast amount of work that I am in charge of now. The HR director suggested that I come talk to her about this after a few of us politely aired grievances as the stragglers sitting around at the end of our company Christmas party. She suggested that I ""sell myself"" if I wanted any kind of change (which is never something I would normally do - I would rather be rewarded for hard work as an acknowledgement, rather than have to ask for it), but that is what I did, layed it all out in black and white, as well as followed up with an email highlighting all the points I discussed with her.

About a week ago, I was pulled into an office and informed by the HR director as well as the CEO of the company that I received a very large raise based on my talk with her and follow up email, etc. The principals (owners) of the company are the ones that determine compensation for employees, however they do not really interact with any of the employees like my actual boss etc. does with me. I am obviously incredibly excited for this to happen, but ever since it has, my relationship with my boss as well as other higher-ranking employees (all who would know about it) has been very awkward. I cant help but get the feeling that they think I should not have gotten such a sizable increase, and that they all associate me with the slump I was in almost 3 years ago. I just get the vibe that everyone is judging and knows that I asked for a raise, which is something I would normally never do. I just had a meeting with my boss about the raise I received and he could not even look me in the eye while talking about it, which made me insanely uncomfortable almost like he thought it was unmerited. Am I reading into this too much and just paranoid? Or how can I make this feel less awkward? Because I was encouraged to discuss and ask for more compensation, I feel like I am having to prove myself once again, rather than already proving my worth and being rewarded for it. 

**TL:DR - I was advised to ask for a raise at my company if I wanted it, and I received a much larger one than expected. Now my work relationship with my bosses seems awkward knowing that they know I asked for more money (and received a lot) almost getting the sense that they may think it is unmerited. I may be overthinking.**"

"My husband [30/M] told me he hates me [30/F] after 2 years of marriage


My mind is so overwhelmed right now. This will be long and I am sorry.

My husband and I have been together for 5 years, married for 2. We have always been compatible and got along well most of the time. He is a very moody person and has pretty bad OCD. He is very OCD about the kitchen being clean. Before we got married, we lived together for a year and he would always ""inspect"" the dishes and the counter tops when he got home from work and would flip out if I didn't clean them enough. On a few occasions, he called me lazy and worthless. However, he would always apologize and be perfectly sweet and loving hours later.

Fast forward to getting married. Things started out great and we bought a new house. However, he started drinking a lot more and things got bad at times. He got a new job and started working with some people that I didn't care for. He would go straight from work to the bars and stay out until midnight most days of the week. 

He started coming home drunk and getting mean with me. One day he texted me and told me he was going the bar near our house after work. I was off that day so I thought I would go there to meet him for a few drinks. Well, when I got there he wasn't there. When I called to see where he was he lied to me and told me he was at that bar. (I was there and saw that he clearly wasn't)

After he came home that night drunk as hell, I confronted him and he called me some names and finally spewed off that he ""hates me"" and he ""never loved me"" and ""didn't want to even marry me in the first place."" I was so shocked I didn't know how to respond. He staggered into the bedroom and went to sleep. I slept on the couch.

The next day I decided to go stay with a friend for a couple of days. He texted and called crying saying that I am the only thing he ""wants"" and that he was sorry. So I went back.

For about a month, things seemed to be going well. Then he went out of town on a business trip for 2 days. I called his cell phone the night he got there to see how he was doing and a woman answered the phone. What the hell? She also said he was drunk and not able to talk. I said I didn't give a fuck and wanted to talk to him immediately. He answered slurring his words and said a lot of BS that made no sense.

When he got home, I confronted him again and asked why a woman had answered his phone. He told me that they decided to share a room with 2 beds to save money (mind you, the company is paying for the room). This woman is also gorgeous, I have met her a couple times. I told him how it made me feel that he shared a room with another woman. He immediately started yelling at me and told me I was overreacting and that it hurt to know I didn't trust him. I told him that I wanted to go to marriage counseling and that I would set up an appointment if he would go. He told me there was ""no way in hell"" he would ""see a shrink."" He told me again that he hated me and just thought he was meant to be single and that the married life wasn't his thing. He stated several times he wanted a divorce.

The next day I didn't speak a word to him and went to work like normal. He texted me and told me he had been thinking and that he would consider seeing a counselor. I called and set up and appointment the next evening. 

I showed up at the appointment at 5:00, right after both of us were to get off of work and he never showed. I called to see where he was and I could tell he was in a bar. I was humiliated in front of the counselor. I came home and he showed up about an hour later apologizing again. I told him I couldn't take it anymore, so I packed up some clothes and a toothbrush and drove to my sister's house in my hometown about an hour away.

Well as you may guess, the next day I was yet again bombarded by texts and voicemails saying he was sorry. He also called my sister and one of my friends and told them to try to talk to me and that he couldn't stand life without me. So again, I went back and he gave me what seemed like a sincere apology. 

It's been 4 months since then and he has been sweet as pie. He's been doing a lot more for me and he hasn't been drinking as much or saying hurtful things to me. In the back of my mind though, I am worried it will happen again.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I am asking. In the back of my mind I know I deserve better. I am a decent person and I know there is someone else out there who would probably treat me better, but I am so in love with this man. It's hard to talk to friends and family because there is some bias. I guess I am just trying to sort my thoughts out there anonymously and see if anyone can provide some insight or thoughts.

UPDATE: I am gone finally.

"MY [34M] son [5M] is really possessive of my GF [32F] and I feel bad, but also concerned, and I can't tell if I'm reading to much into it.


My wife died about two weeks after giving birth due to some unfortunate complications. It's been very hard, but my son (I'll call him Tommy) and I are very close and we've found a way to be happy together. I haven't dated much, just had a few casual relationships and flings. None of those women ever spent time with Tommy, except maybe a trip to get pizza or a day at the park. They were introduced only as friends to him.

Anyway, last spring I met a woman (I'll call her Erica) and I have fallen I love with her. She's kind, loving and supportive-- and she has fully accepted and loved Tommy (which was one of the most important things I was looking for in a spouse). she's the perfect addition to our family. 

Tommy and Erica have absolutely hit it off. They're close and affectionate towards one another, they spend lots of on one all the time together. And I can tell Tommy loves the 'maternal attention' Erica has given him. However, recently Tommy has become sort of cranky about me being around as well. I'm hurt because I love my son, and I hate to think he doesn't want me around... but I can't figure out what the root of all of this is...

 I mentioned I was coming with them to go get ice cream and he got mad and demanded I stay home. When he and Erica are chilling on the couch he makes me sit on a different couch (however I never give in).  He's more than happy when it's just us, so I do t think he actually doesn't like having me around. 

I don't really buy into the whole Oedipal complex, so I don't think it's that. Especially seeing as he knows Erica is not his mom. I just can't for the life of me understand why he would treat me like this. Erica doesn't think it's a problem, and my mother thinks that it's him just basking in having 'mommy time' for the first time in his life.  Is this what it is? Is it just that simple? 

Erica and I have been open and honest-- within the next couple of years we want more kids, marriage and a home together, even though we haven't been together all that long (which is why we are giving it a bit more time, even though I'd do it now if we could). I'm not worried about him getting to attached only for Erica and I to break up.  I just don't think I can live my life as the third wheel to Erica and Tommy, but perhaps that's just me overthinking and being dramatic. 

Another note-- I think a lot about my wife  and her family and how they feel about Erica and Tommy, her dad and I are still close and he's met Erica a few times, he likes her, but I can tell he's concerned about Erica replacing her. Which I think is a whole other can of worms, so I'll digress. 

Can you help me straighten my head out?

"I [39f] get upset when my husband [35m] won't let me leave the room or restrains me during an argument. Is this abuse?


This is a lot of information. DH didn’t grow up in the best home life. I don’t know. I want to give him space to get past this, but it seems to be escalating. Here’s a very lengthy description of what is going on. We recently moved and I don’t have anybody local. Can the Reddit community help me see some clarity here?

During previous fights dh has restrained me to keep me from leaving the room to cool off. This would only make me angrier and make me feel vulnerable. I have no ability to overcome him, he is half a foot taller and weighs twice as much as I do. There are also times when he won’t let me out of a hug if I’m angry. And once he wouldn’t let me up off the bed because I was sad and emotional and wanted to gather my thoughts and feelings before talking to him. I have a history of needing time to process and get my thoughts together before having a confrontational conversation. He gets upset with this and wants to deal with things right then and there. Sometimes with children in the room/next room. Blended family, only the baby (15 months) is shared. Other kids are 5 (mine) 7 (his) 13 (mine) 16 (mine). He is 35. I’m 39. We have been together 2 years.

On Saturday January 7th dh and I got in a verbal argument. The three youngest children were nearby and I didn’t want it to escalate and things be said in front of them. I tried to leave the room. dh blocked me. As I tried to leave he would physically push me back using his body, not his hands. After he cooled off and apologized I told him that he had to stop physically detaining me. I told him it really upsets me.

January 16 2017

At 6pm I took my 5 year old upstairs for a bath and I took a shower after she was done. The baby was on the main floor. I was playing with her before I went upstairs. She did not seem cranky or tired, she seemed to be having fun playing and trying to communicate with me. I have previously asked dh to not let the baby go to sleep between dinner and bedtime as it makes it very difficult to get her to bed.

Texts:

Me: 6:53 - Baby Awake?

dh: 6:53 - Nope

Me: 6:54 - Fun night ahead

dh 7:15 - Don’t worry I’ll stay up with her.

dh woke the baby to come up for ice cream at 8:21. The baby was very cranky and took about 10 minutes to calm down.

I watched tv, ate ice cream, nursed the baby, then played with the baby on the floor until it was time for me to head to bed at 10. dh took the baby down in his basement office, his usual place to try and get her to sleep (he plays video games and watches Netflix with the baby on his lap).

I got ready for bed in our second floor bathroom. I could hear the baby screaming from the basement. It is unusual for her to cry loud enough to hear on the second floor when she is in dh’s office. She didn’t calm down after 10 minutes

Texts

Me: 10:12 - She’s so sad :(

Me: 10:16 - Just bring her

dh: 10:24 - [she] was sad because I put her butt on the floor

Me: 10:24 - Why are you so mean?

At this time dh brought the baby to me and went back to his office. For the next 20 minutes the baby wouldn’t settle down in the dark bedroom. She rolled around, reached for toys from her co-sleeper crib, nursed off and on, and smacked my face to try and get me to play with her. I was angry and sent this text:

Me: 10:45 - This is real fucing nice. Guess I will start showering in the morning. Because fuck playing with her so she doesn’t go to sleep between dinner and bed. Way easier to just let her sleep.

dh then comes up to take the baby. However, I didn’t want him to take her back downstairs to let her cry herself to exhaustion as he had done earlier in the night. So I told him that I would keep her and please go away.

At this time dh tried to take her out of my arms. I asked him again to go away, that she would stay with me. At this time dh painfully grabbed my wrist to limit my movement. At this time the baby was wailing. I told dh “Let me go right now or I will leave you.” dh said “Go ahead, leave.” He held on for another 10 seconds or so and let both me and the baby go. I took time to comfort the baby and let her nurse to calm her down.

dh was immediately regretful and his demeanor changed. He again asked to take the baby downstairs. I refused. He sat on the side of the bed and played with the baby for about 10 minutes. I mentioned that I was upset because my arm still hurt from where he squeezed it. dh went downstairs and turned off his game and then went to bed. He apologized twice, but I did not respond. The baby struggled to fall asleep, she finally went to sleep around 12:00

The next day (11:30 am) there is faint bruising and pain in the area where I was held.

**TL;DR! I am tired of not being able to leave the room during an argument or being physically restrained. Last night it escalated to him forcibly holding my wrist in anger. When is enough? Do I help him through this? Do I leave?**

"Me [31 M] with my Wife [33 F] of 8 years, It's time for babies and I'm having a hard time getting enthusiastic


[removed]"
"My [33F] husband [36M] is discouraging me from losing weight


I am coming up against a ton of opposition from my husband regarding wanting to lose weight. I'm 33, 5'3 and 160 pounds, so I'm pretty overweight for my height. When I met my husband, I was 135 pounds and that's right around what I'd like to weigh again, give or take a couple pounds. I don't think it's unreasonable - it's a healthy weight range.
  
My husband, however, is being really difficult about it. He doesn't tell me outright not to lose the weight, but refuses to be encouraging or supportive. He has gone so far as to accuse me of not caring what he wants and that he thinks I look good fat, basically. We have had full-on fights and he claims that he's just worried about my health and worried I will get an eating disorder (there is no reason to think that I would; I have lost weight before in a healthy way but gained it back due to babies). Then, he'll start going on about how he doesn't like 'rail thin' 'skinny women.' 135 at 5'3 is not 'skinny' or a 'rail' but he refuses to listen to reason.

He also does what I feel is intentionally sabotaging my efforts at eating healthier - buys a lot of sweets and baked goods and acts hurt if I don't eat it and claims he was just 'trying to be nice' if I point out that it's really unfair to bring in food that he knows I have a hard time resisting. He hates most sweet foods so it's not for him at all, either. He likes to make jokes about how he loves having a fat wife, too. 

I feel like this is becoming just as abusive, I guess, as a man trying to make his wife LOSE weight. I think that he's seriously overreacting but I have no idea how to get through to him at this point. There is a history of heart disease in my family and I am already at risk for diabetes. This isn't just a self-esteem issue for me, though it IS one of the factors. It's also health. It's also affecting our sex life because regardless of how HE feels, I loathe the way I look naked and my self-consciousness is affecting my sex drive. I have no idea how to get through to him, though. I've told him ALL of this. It's so disheartening and so much harder not to have encouragement.

Since it might come up: he is naturally very thin so he doesn't understand at all what it's like to struggle with weight or image issues after weight gain. 

edit: I know people rush to find 'feeders' but as I mentioned a few places below, we're open enough about kinks that I know that isn't on his 'list' and I am aware of one unconventional one so it's not like he's pretending to be vanilla. I do know obesity repulses him. He isn't trying to get me to gain MORE but sabotages if I alter my diet with the intent of maintaining my current weight. So, not really a fat fetishist or a feeder, but a chubby-chaser. He wants me to be exactly like this.

As an aside, I have in the past done paid work illustrating fetish material (for fetishes I don't have) so there is no reason for him to think I wouldn't be open minded about the concept (just not wanting to be obese myself, I don't care if you want to think about it and fap to it), or draw myself obese or what have you if that's what he wanted. I am myself very vanilla but I'm quite open minded and non-judgmental.

  **tl;dr**: My husband is actively discouraging me from losing weight and sabotaging my diet. Is this the same as a man who tries to get his spouse to lose weight? Is there ANY way I can get through to him that this is inappropriate?"

"[Dating] I [26F] hate texting people all day, every day. Is this a requirement in the dating world?


As the title says, I'm not a big fan of never-ending text conversations. I don't like having to be glued to my phone at all times. I prefer talking on the phone or meeting up in person - I just find it so much more enjoyable and it's so much easier to get into interesting conversations that way. For the record, I am definitely an introvert but not to an extreme. I like a balance of socializing and alone time. 

A few months ago, I made my first foray into online dating. It was a lot of fun! But it got exhausting after awhile, and my least favorite part of it was that once they got my number, pretty much every guy wanted to be texting from morning til night. I just dealt with it but usually only replied every 1-3 hours. 

See, I don't mind short text conversations if we actually have something interesting to talk about. But I find it fricken tedious having to answer ""how's your day"" 5000x a day. And having to wrack my brain to find topics to bring up to keep the conversation going. I would rather just go about my day in peace and save the chat for when we see each other.

Is there a non-awkward way to bring this up? It feels weird to bring up on its own early on out of the blue. Once someone has started texting me a lot, I feel like just stopping replying conveys a lack of interest but saying ""hey, btw, I don't like texting every day"" could be taken badly too. Does anyone have experience with this? If you're someone who enjoys constant texting, how would you feel if someone you were interested in said to you that they don't want to text all the time? 

And am I a rare breed? Am I going to seriously limit my prospects if I try to find someone that also doesn't want to be constantly texting?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I find constant small-talking over text exhausting and don't like being glued to my phone in general, but everyone I date seems to want to have never-ending text conversations. What's a good way to bring this up? Or is it something I should just deal with so I don't severely limit my prospects?"

"My [26M] girlfriend's [25F] twin brother disappeared 6 years ago. She's still looking for him. I think she should move on, but is it my place to say something?


About 6 years ago, apparently one day my girlfriend's brother goes out and never comes back home. They did all they could to find him but there was nothing. They looked for him themselves, hired private investigators, and did everything humanly possible but he has just vanished...

During the two years that I've been dating my girlfriend, she's still looking for him. She still calls hospitals and morgues and any place that he might show up. She still hopes that he would come back. Her own parents have accepted this reality and have moved on but she hasn't. I don't think there's a PI in the state that she hasn't hired yet.

I can see that she's suffering and it's not good for her. The reality is that her brother would have been found by now if he was to be found. He's most probably not alive anymore. I understand that she doesn't want to accept that but that is the reality. I don't have siblings myself, I don't pretend to understand what she's going through or how difficult it is however it is time that she accepted the reality and focused on herself, gets help to deal with grief and other feelings that she might have. That's what her parents did and they're better now, and she needs to move on as well.

I don't know if it's my place to breach the subject to her. I'm afraid that I might be overstepping here. Should I do this? And if so, how?

"My [24F] bestfriend [24M] told me that my past relationships didn't work because I like sex too much.


So I dated 3 guys. One from high school and the two from college.

1st guy took my virginity. I was also his first. We were both 18 that time. Whenever we had sex, I always initiated it. The relationship lasted for 11 months. We broke up when we started attending different universities.

2nd guy(we were both 19) lasted for 10 months and again, I initiated all our sex acts. We fought a lot because he was complaining that we have sex too many timesWe broke up because of misunderstandings and issues we could not resolve. 

3rd guy (we were both 21)lasted for 1 and a half years. There are times when we fight because he doesn't want to have sex but I wanted to. Often we fight about sex. We broke up after graduating college.

Yesterday, I had a long chat with my best friend. I've known him since we were kids. He is dating the same girl for 6 years. That's why I think he is a relationship expert.

He told me ""guys don't like it when girls are too horny or even hornier than he is. It's a big turn off.""

I asked him what he meant by that.

He told me ""All your relationships didn't work out because you like sex too much.""

I was devastated when he said that. My relationships were not based on sex. I admit, I really like sex and I'm always horny but sex is not the reason why I was with those guys. I only slept with 3 guys. As much as I want to hookup with someone, I can't possibly do it because I'm too scared. But I know my sex drive is higher than most girls I know because I masturbate at least twice a day.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if what he said is true.

"An asshole coworker [?M] sent my [36F] husband [39M] an inflammatory text during a work even. Now he's threatening leaving me.


There was an after work event this week. A coworker was leaving for another job and we were going out for light food and drinks. I don't drink btw. I didn't give my husband details because he usually doesn't ask nor appear to care that I attend these occasional outings which usually end by 6-7pm. 

Here's kind of a text log to get an understanding of what happened. 

Husband 6pm: You have that thing tonight right?  Need dinner after?

Me:  Should be out of there by 8 and fed, no worries about dinner. Times are estimates. 

Husband: Ok. 

Note the following I didn't see until the train ride home at around 11pm. 

Husband 930pm: Hey baby, everything ok?  What's your status

Husband 1005pm:  All good?

Husband 1030: Hey, give me a ping getting worried. 

Me 1033 (sent by asshole coworker): Hey buddy, chill the fuck out. She's in really good hands, I can assure you ;). 

I left my phone at the table and asshole coworker took it upon his drunk self to send that text. Yup my iPhone 4s is not password protected.  I didn't see any of my husbands texts because his notifications had been cleared when asshole coworker opened up messages. I saw it as soon as I got in the train and texted him immediately. 

Me 1105:  Babe, sorry that was not me!  See you when I get home. 

No response from husband. 

When I get home he is in bed, I give him a kiss on the cheek and he doesn't reciprocate. I ask him what's wrong and he says he doesn't want to talk because he's afraid he'd say something he regrets. 

The next day was totally ghosting. He finally approaches me tonight and says that he felt extremely disrespected and is suspicious of my inattention. He said he wasn't keeping tabs on me but making sure I way okay since most of these wrap up by mid evening. 

I profusely apologized and tried to defuse. He wasn't all that receptive. He said he's not sure what to think. He had total trust in me but thinks something nefarious must have been happening for this guy to have my phone and feel bold enough to send that text. Him and I, back and forth, no improvement. 

He finally dropped a serious bomb. He says he doesn't know what to think. But he said that if there's any hope of him believing this was as I say (as actually happened) that I can't be in his words ""the same fucking room with that fucker"". No after work events, if there's a work meeting he wants me to notify HR that there's a personal conflict.  He's heated and said if I can't meet these demands then I can either look for another job or a new husband, my choice. 

Everything is happening so fast. I know he's over reacting, but he does have his reasons. I have bitched out the asshole coworker. Told him off and told him if he touched anything that belongs to me again I'm going straight to the police.  What my husband is demanding is not practical. 

I guess I'm asking if I should risk waiting this out for cooler heads to prevail. Or meet my husbands demands. Or if there's something I can do otherwise.  I am pretty sure he thinks something happened that night. I think if he was assured it is what I say it is he'd move past it, but I can see from his perspective it looks like shit. 


Tl;dr: Out at a work function, running late. Husband was trying to get ahold of me to no avail. A coworker picked up on this and used my phone to send husband a text that seemed as if I was dissing him at the least, fucking around on him at the most. Need advice on how to proceed.
