"Me [15F] with my dad[46 M] married my school bully mom, and now our relationship is totally broken.

"Me [17F] with my step family, moving into their house which is no wheelchair accessible.


*NOT

My dad is marrying his girlfriend of 2 years, Cindy and she has 2 kids which means that we will be moving into their house soon. Her house is much larger and in a great spot between the schools that my brother and I attend and her children attend. Our house is small but its just the 3 of us and is already set up for my wheelchair, open concept, ramps etc. The problem is her house isn't and there has been no effort made to do so.

It is a ranch style home with no large steps but the front and back doors have a bump which is very difficult to get my chair over, often I need someone to push/life me over. The 2 bathrooms are very small and have no support bars or room for my chair, I can go alone but its VERY difficult and timely.  The flooring in between rooms is bumpy, very narrow hallways etc. I can barley reach the kitchen sink unless I put my brakes and lift myself up to wash my hands, the cabinets are high up I need someone to get me dished down etc

Minor accommodations can be made to fix some of these issues but there will need to be big ones like the bathroom but there has been no attempt and we are moving in a month or two. My father idolizes Cindy. She is the love of his life and I feel he puts her first but that could just be me. He is a great father to us and always has been, when our mom died and he was alone for so long until Cindy came. She isn't much of a ""mother"" but she is nice person and seems friendly enough when she is around us but my brother and I feel like we are slowly being pushed out of the family and replaced by Cindy and her two children, they seem to dictate what we do, where we go, always something that want etc.

Dad argues that we had him for years growing up and since we are both adults the younger kids need him more then we do. Which is fine I'm moving out next Sept 2018 for college anyways and its nice to see my dad finally happy.
The problem is until then I will be living in Cindys house and I keep telling them they need to make changes but nothing has been done. They don't want to do all the repairs because her house is already really nice and it could be pricey renovations. Like redoing a bathroom just for me when i move out in a year.

But I already struggle when I'm there, I need someone to help me constantly. I can barley use the bathroom without it fearing I'm doing to fall or get stuck. Im not sure how to approach this or maybe I should just move out early on my own..

  
  **tl;dr**: Moving into my step mom's house, it is not wheelchair friendly and there have been no attempts made to do so. I struggle but feel I am pushed to the side and viewed as high maintenance.

"UPDATE: My mom (50sF) won't tell me (23F) who my father is


(original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64ndrd/my_mom_50sf_wont_tell_me_23f_who_my_father_is/)

First, I want to thank everyone for their advice, especially those who shared their personal experiences. I didn't reply much, but I read every comment, and you all gave me a lot to think about. I truly appreciate it. As for the update...

I had a feeling that confronting my mom or threatening no-contact wouldn’t go over well, so I wanted it to be a last resort. So to start, I took one person's advice and decided to look around my childhood home for any clues.

I live in my hometown, so I drop by my mom’s house pretty regularly. A couple of days ago, while I was visiting, she ran to the store to pick up some things. It seemed like as good an opportunity as any.

Her bedroom seemed like the obvious choice, so I started there. I’m not proud of the snooping, but I did it anyway. Within ten minutes, I found something in a drawer by her bed: a driver’s license that expired in 1991, mixed in with a bunch of other papers.

It belonged to a man I didn’t recognize. His address was listed as our house—and as I mentioned in the original post, my mom had told me that my father lived in this house, at least for a while. I can’t know for sure that he’s my father just based on the presence of his driver’s license, but who else could he be? Why else would my mom keep that license?

So now I had a name and a date of birth. I also had the guy's next of kin (a sister), because there was some type of organ donor card attached to the back of the driver's license. It was a place to start, anyway.

Naturally, I tried looking him up on Facebook first. No luck so far. I haven't found any obituaries, so for now, I'm operating under the assumption that he's alive. I did find a record on the state department of corrections website that shows he was in prison at some point and was released in '97. (The full name matches, and so does the date of birth, so I'm pretty sure it's the same guy.) I don't know what he was in for, but apparently, you can formally request copies of records. I'm thinking about submitting a request. Beyond that, the logical next step will probably be to look for his sister.

So that's pretty much where I'm at. Even if I locate the mystery guy, I don't know if I'll ever contact him. I guess I just like the idea of it being an option. And if I do try to contact him someday, I'll probably come back here first, asking for more advice. ;)

Thanks again for all your help, everyone.

**TL;DR:** I snooped around my childhood home and found an old driver's license that I suspect belongs to my father. I haven't located him yet, but I did find out that he was in prison at one time, and I may request additional records. If I do find him someday, I don't know if I'll contact him."

"Update: My [29F] boyfriend of two years [38M] won't leave the apartment his husband died in. How do I convince him that this is no longer healthy and is stunting our relationship?


[Here's my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65xn4x/my_29f_boyfriend_of_two_years_38m_wont_leave_the/)

_______________

I took a day to come to terms with all the realities you fantastic group of people helped me see and sat down with Matthew last night. I told him, first and most importantly, that I loved him and that I wanted him to be happy and healthy and taken care of. We talked for a while about how his therapy has been going and he agreed that he needed more, and that it would be beneficial for us to go together. He also came to the conclusion himself that he needed to move out of the apartment and had been putting off doing so because he hadn't been ready to let go of Hei yet, but that I had helped him move forward and that he was ready to build a life with me.

We're going to see a therapist together starting next week and he's ready to look at apartments when his lease is up in August. We talked vaguely about marriage once I'm finished with my degree and he reiterated that he was in love with me because of me, not because Hei is gone and he's lonely. 

I just want to thank this community for the tremendous amount of compassion I was shown with my original post. I believe that we're on the right track to make healthy choices for ourselves and our relationship, and this sounding board is a large part of the reason why. Thank you again. Love and light to all of you.

tl;dr My boyfriend of two years is ready to move forward with his life, and is seeking counseling and looking at new apartments for us to share together. All was well.

"Me [57M] with my PhD student [20sF]: I am concerned she is suffering from anorexia. How can I help her?


""Katie"" has been my PhD student for nearly a year now (I am her supervisor). Katie is a great student; she is very responsible, hard-working, and reliable. I have no concern with her academic capabilities, but rather her health.


At the start of her PhD, Katie looked fairly healthy (140lbs at 5'8""). As the months went on, I noticed she was looking thinner and thinner. I attributed this to stress, as her PhD program is demanding. Currently, Katie is extremely gaunt. I would estimate she is 85lbs at 5'8"". Whenever we have lab meetings that include lunches, Katie states that she has already eaten and refuses to eat. If other lab members pester her, she will eat and then disappear to the bathroom for 20-30 minutes.


I am concerned about Katie's health, but I am unsure if it is my place to say anything. She meets all my requirements when it comes to her school work. She gets all her work done before deadlines, and her work is of high quality. She appears lethargic all the time and I see her struggle, but her alleged illness does not interfere with her work (yet).


My question to Reddit is: How can I approach Katie about her health? She is rather quiet and reserved, and none of her lab peers are close with her. She is also very professional, so I would not describe our supervisor-student relationship as ""friends"".

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [32 M] dating 5 years, found a mystery apartment key and fob on his desk.


Throwaway because his friends know my main account.

I'll try to keep this brief, but a little backstory is needed to justify my concern.

I've been dating my current SO for around 5 years, been living with him for 3. So far, our relationship has been great, save for a bump in the road we hit in November. 

He'd stepped out to answer a phone call, and had left Skype open on his laptop. Normally, I'm not a suspicious person at all, but for some reason while walking by it, I felt the need to glance over at the open chat window. In his contact list were just the names of his business partners and a friend or two that I knew, but at the bottom there was a woman's name I didn't recognize. So, against all better judgement, I clicked on it.

Turns out, it was a woman in China who he had been having extremely explicit conversations with for the better part of a year. She had been sending him pictures of herself in various bras/ nothing at all, while he provided commentary, sending her all sorts of compliments I'd certainly never received from him. I didn't scroll far enough up to see how long it'd been going on; I just packed up a few things and disappeared to a friend's house for a couple of days. He, of course, was incredibly remorseful, and begged to reconcile. After a very long, emotional, and apologetic conversation, I decided to forgive him with the caveat that we work on our relationship. He deleted her off of Skype, allowed me to look through his computer whenever I felt the need, etc. 

This brings me to today. My SO is currently away on business, so I've been puttering around our apartment cleaning and dusting. Well, I was dusting his desk, and sitting there is a key with a very fancy silver fob attached, from an apartment rental service I'd never heard of before (it definitely was not from our apartment, that's for sure). I Googled the company, and they offer apartments everywhere from about an hour away, to across the country (one of the provinces was somewhere he'd been recently on a business trip). Since they only offer residential apartments, there's no way it could belong to any of the sub-contracting companies he's been interfacing with over the last couple of months. 

I know it's possible there's a logical explanation for this, but due to the past history, I'm having a hard time coming up with one. 

I sent him a Skype message earlier today, asking him about his trip, then bringing up the fact that I'd found a key/fob, and was wondering what it was for. He has not yet responded.

Am I just being paranoid? Is this something to worry about? Is there an explanation I'm just not seeing here? Why would he leave it lying around if it would incriminate him for something?!

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

"I [36f] am planning to leave my SO [35m]. Scared to death, don't know how to do it.


Ugh this is going to be long so I apologize in advance. I have gotten myself into a HUGE mess with this guy and I don't even know where to begin to describe the shit-show. We've been together for a year now and it's been an awful year full of pain, lies, gaslighting, and emotional/financial abuse on his end. The problems started about a month in, he was wonderful at first like they all are but then I started to see the red flags popping up. Bad temper, flirting with other women, criticizing me left &amp; right, yelling at me, raging. He was addicted to porn, looking at pics &amp; videos all the time no matter where we were. I even caught him looking ta porn while we were visiting my parents once. I don't forbid porn at all, I just asked him to keep it private and not look at it right in front of me or out in the open. He was also a member of all kinds of porn and dirty adult chat groups on social media. He would flirt openly right in front of me as well, with all his female friends and any cute girl he talked to. His best friend is his ex and he tells her he loves her, calls her babe, tries to convince her to leave her husband, but then tells me I have nothing to worry about. Whenever I would try to voice my concerns about these things, he would blow up and call me insecure, too sensitive, jealous, a prude, etc. Every discussion would devolve into him yelling at me for having feelings and me apologizing for talking about them. 

Every instinct was screaming at me to get out, but I stupidly stayed, partially because he managed to convince me that I was just mentally ill, any issues I had were solely my own, and I needed to work on myself if I didn't want to feel sad and hurt all the time. So I put up with the excessive porn, the flirting, catching him talking to other women on social media, and a bunch of other BS that I can't even begin to list here. I swallowed my feelings and told myself they were just a manifestation of my ""mental illness"". I have cried more in the past year than I have in my entire life and I am a shell of the strong, confident woman I used to be. I'm so angry at myself for letting things get this bad. He's never hit me, but he gets up in my face and shouts, and once when I caught him talking to an ex and being secretive about it, he slammed on the brakes in the middle of the highway and threw his phone in  my direction screaming ""Here! This is what you want, take it!!!"" He makes ""jokes"" about how he almost bought the supplies to kill his exes and he always says stuff like ""I know you won't ever leave me, you love me too much plus anyone you dated after me would suffer"". He tracked my phone for months as well, illegally by using police software. He talks shit about my friends, my family, makes fun of my middle school-aged sister's appearance, etc. Every time I hear his car pull up outside my stomach drops and the anxiety starts up. There's just so much to tell about what a nightmare this relationship is, but you get the idea. 

I know this is abuse, no one needs to tell me. Even though he's not horrible all the time, I've been reading dozens of books on abuse over the past couple months and I KNOW this guy is dangerous and I need to leave before it escalates into physical abuse.

Problem is- I have no idea how to leave. I am terrified of him. We live together(lease is in my name, thank god), and about 4-5 months ago he asked me to marry him and I said yes cause I was too scared to say no. We combined our phone plans and finances(stupid stupid stupid I know) and I shut down my bank account. He spends so damn much money though that I can't manage to save anything. I did open my own account last week with the help of my best friend, who also helped me get a new phone that's not on my SO's plan with a number he doesn't have. I rerouted my direct deposit to my new account, and it should hit this friday so I'll at least have some money that he can't touch.

That said, when he doesn't see my paycheck in our account he's going to know that something is up and I am so, *so* scared. He's going to flip out and the shit is going to hit the fan. I'm almost crying just thinking of how angry he's going to be. He has screamed at me red-faced with spittle flying over much smaller things than this. He thinks everything is fine with us and I'm happy, probably because I just stopped talking about the things that bother me a while ago so he would stop getting mad, so the breakup is going to come as a complete surprise. I don't plan to be alone with him when it happens, but he has a key to the apartment and I'm afraid he's going to come back and trash the place and/or hurt my pets. 

I have told my friends what's going on along with a few coworkers, so I do have plenty of support. He is pretty much nuts though so I have a bad feeling he won't just let me leave him quietly. Should I lay it all out and tell him exactly why I'm leaving or should I just be out of the house and send him a breakup text? I'm so lost. Someone please tell me everything is going to be okay and I'm going to get out of this in one piece. 

TL;DR- Relationship of one year has been miserable the whole time. Dude is a possible psychopath. I'm planning to leave, I have almost everything in order to do so, but I'm terrified of his reaction. Please advise :(

**EDIT: WOW!!! I am simply blown away by all these responses. People talk a lot of shit about reddit and about this sub in particular, but you guys are seriously amazing. I'm near tears from the outpouring of support I've received here. Thank you all so much, I'll be following your advice and I will post an update when all is said and done!**"

"As a non-med school student, I [M27] am having trouble attending my GF's [F24] med school social events because all they talk about (understandably) is med school and each other


My GF of 6 years is a med school student, living about an hour away from me. I am currently working full time as an engineer. I see her most weekends and usually once during the week. I’d say we have a very strong relationship.

She is very close to her classmates because they spend all of their time in class, studying, and living together, not to mention the “shared hardship” thing of being in med school. Med school is pretty consuming, so when they hang out together socially that’s all they talk about – their classes and each other. Their conversations are either a flurry of acronyms and medical terms that I don’t understand, or gossip about people that I don’t know. The only way I can participate is to ask questions that everybody else already knows the answer to- like “What is a reticulocyte?” or “Who is “George”?”. Conversations tend to be on the larger side with 6+ participants, so any question I ask often ends up feeling like an interjection or a non-sequitur – quickly answered by somebody before the conversation moves on. 

On top of that, med students have a tendency to date each other, so there aren’t often other SO’s in the same situation. I’m usually the only non-med student. 

I have talked to her about this. Her thoughts are that she doesn’t want us to have two separate lives. That if I’m a part of her life, then I need to hang out with her friends too. “Like are you just never going to go to any of my med school/doctor functions because you’ll think it’s awkward?”

She’s been in med school for two years, and I’ve attended 100% of the events that she’s asked me to with zero complaint (overt or otherwise). I want to be a part of her life. I don’t have a problem attending events with something to do (watch a movie, go on a hike, etc.), ones with other non-med students, or smaller ones without a “group dynamic”. The events that are the hardest are those that meet all of the following criteria- (1) centered around drinking (I don’t drink), (2) no other non-med school students, and (3) 5+ people that all know each other very, very well. 

I’d like to get reddit’s input on whether or not I am being reasonable, and any advice for these situations. Thanks!

**Tl;dr**: My GF’s med school friends only talk about med school and other med students, and I (as a non-med student) am having trouble interacting with them socially.

I am absolutely destroyed at the moment.  My initial reaction was the immediate onset of a panic attack.  Luckily I have had a few in the past and knew that eventually I would be okay and able to breathe again.  

The attack lasted about 2 hours, with it ending just before typing out this post.  I am not sitting here completely numb.  I saw no signs of this coming, I mean NONE.  Our day went well she left in the morning for work, she worked the day shift, and I worked at night.  I got off a bit earlier than expected, she had just sent me a message saying she was excited for our day off tomorrow together. 

She had said if I was off early she would be cutting the night short to come spend some time with me. Once I came home I gave her a calll to see if this was still the plan.  She said she was going to to go to a friends, I asked if I should come meet them somewhere.  She responding by saying ""No, I don't want that"".  Red flag.  The conversation was then full of unenthused answers, to any of my questions.  I asked if something was up, did not hear a response,  repeated my question, no response again.  She just wanted to get off the phone. I made a mistake and asked if she wanted to tell me something, no answer, so I asked the ultimate question.  ""Are you breaking up with me?""  Her response ""Yes"". Me ""for real?"".  Her ""Yes, I don't know.""   

The panic attack started, I told her about it. She didn't seem to care. Haven't heard from her since her one response "" Staying at my friend _____'s house"".  

I likely will not get any sleep tonight.  Wishing I had someone by my side to talk to.

"My [27F] boyfriend [28M] of 3 years is socially unaware and I'm feeling very isolated after our move.


I have been dating my boyfriend (hereby known as BF) for about three years. We met through a mutual hiking / outdoor / climbing club while I was in graduate school. We hit it off really well. We liked the same books, the same movies, and we shared a love of travel and outdoor activities. He's very smart and I really enjoyed discussing just about everything that I could think of with him. When I graduated, we decided to move in together. We had a very happy honeymoon phase for a while and then things started to go down hill. 

To paint a stereotyped picture of myself, I am the female Chris Traegar from Parks and Rec. I love to be outside, I love to be constantly doing things, I love, love, love to interact with people. I work in very people oriented fields and I'm still ready to hit the ground running when I get home. Superlatives that I have won in my life include ""most likely to literally kill you with kindness"" and ""most likely to put the energizer bunny out of work."" So, I acknowledge that I have my flaws and can be intense. Human interaction and physical activity are very important to me. I do require some alone time, but I'm pretty happy with only 1-2 hours alone per week. 

BF, by contrast, is introverted. He is also fairly socially awkward. The extent of this I didn't totally realize in graduate school because I had my new relationship blinders on and truthfully, I was trying to cram 80 hours of activities into my week - so I didn't notice a lot of things. My problem isn't so much that he is introverted or awkward (which are absolutely separate things) but rather how he treats my friends, my family, new acquaintances, and me as a result. This was something that was medium-aggravating when we first moved in together but it became a major problem when we moved to a new city - his home town - about a year ago. 

BF has frequently expressed that he dislikes my friends. I can't really identify a pattern because he feels this way about male friends, female friends, friends that are older than us, friends that are younger than us, you get the picture. Generally, he says they are: (1) talking down to him, (2) full of bullshit, or (3) are trying to hard to impress others. From my perspective, I have only noticed one particular friend being condescending and I called that friend on it on the spot. To BF, there is something wrong, weird, or off about seemingly every person he meets.  He particularly dislikes one friend (male friend, married to another close friend of mine) that  I made in college who happens to live where we just moved. This is particularly frustrating for me because I was excited to have two good friends in the area. BF is also an asshole towards this friend but gets very angry when I point out that he is being condescending, talking over said friend, and stuff like that. He will actually say ""you're acting like FRIEND'S NAME"" as a derogatory statement if he doesn't like something I am saying or doing. 

BF rarely meets with friends of his own since moving. He might go out once or twice a month. On the rare occasion that I am invited, I am left out of the conversation. He'll interrupt me, talk over me, and make fun of what I say or switch the topic back to something he and his friend(s) have in common that I cannot really talk about in any detail. I feel frustrated because I go out of the way to introduce him to my friends, my acquaintances, and include him in activities where we can both meet new people. I also try ridiculously hard to make sure he is included in the conversation even if I am meeting with a friend I haven't seen in six years. He doesn't do the same, even though I point it out. A couple of his friends have made efforts to make me feel included, which I truly appreciate, but BF will steer conversations back in directions that I cannot totally follow. 

When I bring BF on outings to try to meet people, he picks a fight. Every. Time. Not with the other people, just with me on the way there. It could be because the laundry wasn't done or I left a single fork in the sink - whatever. But the result is, I feel two inches tall by the time we get to wherever we're going, if we even get there. 

I've also tried to go out to meet with current friends alone. BF will complain that I'm abandoning him and excluding him. For example, a female friend group of mine goes hiking about once a month. We also sometimes have a secondary ""boyfriends / partners too"" hike. He always finds a reason not to go to the ""everyone is invited"" outing but gets really upset when I want to leave to go out with my female friends. 

We fight all the time now and it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough. When we started dating he was very free spirited and all about equality in relationships but recently I feel pressured to take on a very traditional (think 1950s) role. I can cook a bad-ass dinner but it won't matter because I somehow missed a fork in the sink. I've tried bringing up numerous times that while I'm happy to chip in and do my part - or slightly more than my part (I love cooking), it's not my responsibility to clean the entire house. This turns into an argument about ""well I make more money than you.""

We don't really have engaging discussions anymore. There are a handful of topics that he hyper-obsesses over and repeats like Adele's Hello on the radio. The information doesn't change and sometimes it just feels like he's looking to fight with me. 

Finally, he never misses an opportunity to talk about how my parent's divorce has ruined my family beyond repair. I literally cannot talk about a single negative thing happening at home (I'm the oldest in a large, large family). It's hard because I enjoy sharing about the good things happening but I feel like I can't talk to him about anything negative happening in my life. 

So r/relationships, do you have any advice? I love him but I also am aware that we can't move forward if things don't change. How can I tactfully discuss this with BF? Do you have any similar stories or words of wisdom? Thanks! 


Also, there is a stinkbug flying around my bedroom. I  wanted to share that with someone.  It has now landed on my bed and my dog is looking at it like he found God. 
  
  ---   
 TL;DR: BF finds something wrong with almost every friend of mine that he meets. BF rarely invites me out with his friends and when he does, I have to actively fight to be a part of the conversation / to participate. I feel very excluded. He gets jealous when I go out with my female friends &amp; seems to sabotage any attempt to go out to make new friends together. I'm not sure if he's socially unaware or an asshole. How do I tell? If it's lack of awareness, how do I address this?"

"My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of 1 year is obsessed with photography, and it's killing me


I've been dating this girl (let's call her Jamie) for just over a year now. Everything is great - we have matching sex drives, are both studying the same thing at school, and have a lot of other things in common. I’m quite inexperienced though – she’s my first romantic and sexual partner (while she’s had a few boyfriends and partners before me).

I really love this girl. She’s sweet, smart, kind, caring, and absolutely beautiful. However, she shows a lot of signs of anxiety, particularly having to do with photographing and recording a huge majority of her life. 

As an example, not long ago I was out with her family for Easter dinner and her birthday and the entire day she wouldn’t stop taking photos and asking other people to pose and take photos which got on almost everybody’s nerves, including mine. A few months ago, she came and stayed with me in my hometown, and the whole time she was pestering me about photos – I brought her out to a nice quiet area by the ocean and she kept yelling at me to hold poses and take photos of her which drove me insane – I couldn’t wait for her to leave. Her father is exactly like her too, constantly obsessing over photographs and making sure that they’re properly stored and safeguarded. She may have picked up this behavior from him.

Jamie is totally obsessed with photography. Shortly after I started dating her (about a few weeks in), she slowly started to reveal this behavior. I thought it was cute at first, but it got really out of hand quickly. She won’t stop taking photos on Snapchat (for example when I say “cute things”, she’ll take a photo of me and write down what I said, sometimes freaking out about writing down the “exact thing” that I said, asking me over and over to repeat exactly what I said). She’s constantly doing this 24/7, even at 3 a.m. when I’m trying to get to sleep next to her which is extremely annoying to me. 

She constantly talks about and obsesses about taking photos – with her phone, her digital camera, and her polaroid camera. She also constantly talks about posting these photos to social media – Facebook, Instagram, her Snapchat story and what caption to put on these photos. She’s super caught up with all of this, oftentimes ignoring school and other responsibilities in her life to focus on this obsession.

Overall, all of this has impacted my life quite a bit.
If she can’t record something or if she regrets not taking a photo (or taking the “wrong” photo) or posting the “wrong” photo or the “wrong” caption on a photo, she’ll break down, often to the point of tears and sometimes screams. 

In addition, she oftentimes will stay in her house all day, “working on sorting her photos”. Last time I checked her laptop, she had over 80,000 photos stored on there and I wouldn’t be surprised if her collection of photos was in the hundreds of thousands.
I’ve also been reluctant to go on dates and do exciting things with her, particularly on “important days” where I know that she’ll want to take a lot of photos. The thought of going out and doing something with her makes me feel uneasy, because I know that all she’ll want to do is go and take photos, and worry incessantly when she’s not able to do so or when she feels like she’s missed an opportunity for a photo (I’ll often hear about this for days if it occurs).

I think that she may have some form of anxiety or OCD, but she refuses to go see someone to talk about it, claiming that therapists haven’t done anything for her in the past (although she’s agreed that this behavior impacts her life at a few points). Talking to other people who know her, she’s apparently also been like this for years, and apparently it’s gotten worse over time.

I don’t know what to do about all of this. I really love Jamie, but I’m also sick of her obsession with photographs and “recording the moment” as I feel that this oftentimes prevents me from living in the moment and enjoying my time with her. When I go out on a date with her, I want to enjoy my food – I don’t want to wait 5 minutes for her to take photos of it. I don’t want to spend my nights helping her choose a filter for an Instagram post. I don’t want to be forced to post things to my Facebook and Instagram page to make her feel happy. Quite honestly, if I didn’t have any photographs of me or my past I probably wouldn’t care too much.

I don’t want to lose Jamie though – I’m very in love with her, and she’s so amazing to me in many ways. Every one of my friends and her friends think that we're a great couple. I feel like I may also be a bit possessive of her since she’s my first ever romantic partner – the thought of her being with anyone else makes me angry and for this reason I don’t want to leave her. But maybe this is because she’s my first love and I’ve got these rose-tinted glasses on or something.

What should I do? I’m clueless about what to do in this situation. I want her to change, but at the same time I know that a behavior so ingrained as this one will be difficult or impossible to change, especially as she doesn’t want to change it. I’ve tried talking to her about this and how I feel about it, and she’s broken down crying, blaming and insulting herself. I don’t know what to do!

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend won't stop taking photos and recording things, posting to Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, and worrying about not having taken a photo or not having posted the right photo. She knows she has a problem but doesn’t want to take any steps to change anything. This is seriously impacting my life in a number of ways and I don’t really know what to do about all of this.

**EDIT** I forgot to say that I'm moving away from her at the end of this month (I'm done school and she has two years left of school) so we'll be long-distance (300km one-way) for the foreseeable future. A positive outcome of this is that she'll have time to work on herself if she chooses to do so. On the other hand, maybe it would be in my best interests to move on from this relationship."

"Our (25f/27m) neighbors (40s?) keep parking in our driveway. How can we get them to stop without damaging relationship?


We just bought a house that has potential 2 back to back off street parking spaces, but most houses have on street parking and one off street spot. Our neighbors have a garage and small driveway that would fit their car, but it would be back to back, not side by side so not effective.       
         
When the house was vacate, apparently our neighbors parked in our driveway to ""make it seem like someone lived there"". I don't understand that because it's a good neighborhood where you wouldn't expect break ins and the houses are super close to each other.           
             
Our house is being completely renovated by my boyfriend. We are currently living with his parents, and he will go there from 1-3 days a week depending on work schedule to work at our house. We told our neighbors they could continue to use the spot until he started working there. He does not want to be liable for breaking their car accidentally while he's swinging things around and throwing stuff out. Or like a nail getting dropped on the drive and they get a flat tire.        
         
We also needed a huge dumpster for the old stuff in the house. He told them about a week before to stop parking there because we need the spot for the dumpster. He went to our house on that Monday, when the dumpster was arriving and they were parked there. It took several hours to contact them and a pissed of delivery guy to get them to move the car. He told them again, do not park in front of the dumpster because he will be throwing things in it and he didn't want to break their car. They continue to park there. Also, they explained that it was the wife's birthday Sunday night and they got too drunk and forgot.
             
           
The dumpster man was supposed to pick up the dumpster 3 weeks ago. It is still at our house. I believe it's because he came to pick it up and their car was in front of it. My boyfriend told them keep the car out that day but I don't believe them that they did.            
          
My boyfriend isn't sure what to do now, he does not want the neighborly relationship to be damaged by telling them off, but I'm done caring. I really don't mind telling them off but he thinks we have no ground because we have our toilets sitting in the backyard and that annoys the wife apparently. But their house is pretty trashy, one of the worst on the street. Obviously our is bad because of renovation but eventually it will be a nice middle class house, but they have a dead tree in their backyard that falls on to our yard that we don't complain about.              
             
How can we politely buy firmly get them to stop parking in our spot?        
              
**tldr** told neighbors to stop parking in our parking spot because we are renovating and they continue to park there."
"My mother [43 F] has deluded herself into thinking a situation is happening that isn't, and is mad at me [22 F] for it.


**UPDATE at the end**

Reddit, guys, I really need some advice here.

**Background:**

My parents got divorced when I was 10, and while they got along at first, my dad got remarried and they couldn't agree on anything after that. They fought for custody of my brother [17 M] and I, and since I was the oldest I was constantly put in the middle. I went a long time thinking my dad was a terrible person for all the things my mom told me he did, and I hated him for a while. 

My senior year of highschool, I found out my mom was pretending to be me on my Facebook account, talking to a woman who had taken my senior pictures for my dad and telling her I didn't like them, didn't have fun taking them and didn't want to be tagged in them (because she only wanted Facebook to see the pictures she had taken, not my dad's). This woman was pretty hurt and had no idea it wasn't actually me saying these things. I immediately texted her and told her that was a fucked up thing to do, and changed my password since she violated my privacy and pretended to be me. She reacted by taking all of my money out of my bank account for a made up debt I now suddenly owed her, and I went home, packed up all my stuff, and moved to my dad's.

This made me spiral into a depression, because I had realized i'd spent most of my life thinking my dad was awful and my mom never did anything wrong and didn't deserve any of it, but after that I realized she was pretty messed up too, and I didn't know who to believe anymore. I couldn't wait to turn 18 and move away so I wouldn't be a part of their drama anymore, and could love them both from a distance.  

Fast forward to now, I now live 1,000 miles away from my parents. I decided to forgive all past transgressions on both sides so I could have good relationships with them both, separate from each other, and my mom never understood this despite my trying to explain it. My mom would continue to try and tell me things my dad did to hurt her and my brother, and I've told her several times that I have zero interest in anything that goes on between them and not to talk to me about it. As far as i'm concerned, when i'm talking to my mom, my dad doesn't exist, and vice versa. (It's important to note that not once has my dad ever told me anything my mom had done, and doesn't mention her, ever.)

**Current Situation:**

My dad is finally able to come and visit me next week for the first time since moving here 2.5 years ago. During the time he'll be here, my brother will be turning 18. The plan was for my dad, brother, and step mom to all come visit for a couple days. I didn't mention it to my mom because I figured she already knew and there was no reason for me to mention it to her anyway.

Yesterday I got a text from my mom that read:
&gt; ""So, not one soul told me about this trip to (state) for (brother's) birthday. Not only did I have no idea I wouldn't get to spend my son's 18th bday with him at all.....but we made plans to go see Jeff Dunham in (another city) that night so he could spend the day with dad. I'd prefer it if you stayed at dad's when you come visit in May (for my brother's graduation). I'm not doing this anymore.""

So, my initial reaction is: wtf? 
After talking to my brother, it seems he forgot to tell my dad he had made plans with my mom, so my dad, thinking there were no other plans in the way, decided to come and visit me and take my brother so he could see me, too. He bought everyone plane tickets. 

This is what I sent back to my mom:
&gt; ""Idk why you're mad at me. I didn't know you had plans with him and I didn't know that you didn't know he was coming here. It's not my responsibility or place to tell you things like that. It's not my fault (brother) forgot to tell dad about your plans and it's not my fault that you and dad can't communicate with eachother efficiently so that this entire situation could have been avoided. Now (brother's) upset that he's letting everyone down and i'm upset that somehow i'm STILL being thrown into the middle of shit that doesn't have anything to do with me even when i'm 1,000 miles away. We will stay with one of our friends in May.""

After my mom flipped out, my brother told my dad he wasn't going to see me anymore since he felt bad that he made plans with mom first and forgot about them, my dad called me to tell me my brother wasn't coming and he honestly had no idea why he wasn't coming. 

My brother listened to my mom on the phone with one of her friends, and from the way she was talking, she truly believes that I knew that she didn't know about the trip, and that she's convinced herself that my dad planned this all out just to fuck with her and make her not see my brother for his ""very important"" birthday. She told my brother directly that I ""attacked her"" in that text message. After all this, my brother decided to come on the trip. He said ""i felt bad for her because I fucked up, but if she's going to slander you and dad then she doesn't deserve it.""

And now we come to the true problem. This is the next and last thing she's said to me so far, and I have no idea how to respond or go forward from here.

&gt;""The FACT that you are still blind to what he is doing &amp; his motives is literally astounding to me. &amp; yea it does have to do with you because you keep allowing him to use you to hurt me.

&gt;WHY would he make plans for an 18 year olds bday &amp; not ask him what he wants to do &amp; where he wants to go?! Who does that?! And never say a word?!!

&gt;No one thinks it's strange to go to (my state) just weeks before you are coming here? No one? (Brother) would rather go to New York or someplace he hasn't been. But instead of discussing it with his now adult son, he makes his own plans with his own agenda

&gt;I won't believe for one second it never crossed your mind it was weird.

&gt;(Brother) should be upset! Upset he is being used as a pawn at 18 years old without his permission!!!

&gt;Just like you allow him to use you. I send (brother) over there for all the holidays, mine or not! I went out of my way to ask (brother) what he wanted to do for his birthday &amp; made sure dad also had time with him! I don't behave the way ya'll do!!
And this is it!!
I went over there to see you in Sept. &amp; I've never felt more unwanted &amp; unwelcome anywhere in my entire life

&gt;But i'm SURE dad won't feel that way when he is there. You'd NEVER treat him like that.

&gt;You honestly think had (brother) been given the options he would have wanted this?! Absolutely not.

&gt;The game is still being played, &amp; i'm the one being hurt &amp; YES.....you ARE still allowing it. So stop lying to yourself. You don't care

&gt;No reason to worry anymore, we haven't been close in the last year anyway. 

&gt;I'm fine.
Enjoy""


Reddit.

I think my mom is crazy.

Literally all of this is in her head and none of it is happening. My dad made a plan to come see me, made sure it was ok with me and my boyfriend, and asked my brother if he wanted to come. My brother said yes, forgetting all about his plans with my mom, and so my dad bought plane tickets. 

When my mom came in September, she didn't ask but instead told me she had bought tickets. When she was here, she somehow got it in her head that I was mad at her, and despite me trying to assure her that I wasn't mad, she acted like a child, refused to believe me, and stayed in our guest room the entire rest of the time she was here, which was like 2 days. I made efforts to try and invite her to go put put or bowling or anything at all, and she would decline and stay in the room. Then went home and cried that I had treated her like shit and didn't want her there. 

Idk what to do. Idk how to respond. My mom always makes herself the victim, no matter what it is. I was depressed and cutting myself? No, I was faking it just to hurt her. I was quiet at lunch because I was tired and had a lot on my mind? No, I hate her and don't want her to be here.

I'm pretty hurt that she thinks I would intentionally conspire with my dad to hurt her, especially since I've told her over and over I don't want anything to do with what goes on between them bc I mentally could not handle it anymore.

What should I do, reddit? The only response I can think of is ""you're crazy, get some help"" But somehow I don't think that'll go over too well.

**- Edit**

I woke up to a long text about how she feels.

--She says my father and I ""stole her son's 18th birthday from her, after she's spent years fighting to not miss one (They fought over full custody the whole time - she says she was fighting for equal custody, and he wanted full with no visitation. I believed this growing up.) ""Then legally have been forced to miss more than any parent should ever have to.""

--Then she talks about how when my brother was born she was under ""nightmare conditions"" because she had just found out my dad had an affair (unsure if it was emotional or physical) and even though she was mad at him, she still allowed him to be in the room when his son was born, because she ""chose not to deny him the birth of his son even though he didn't deserve to be in there and had every right not to allow him"" And says how she never denied him the right to his children. Then that child grew up, reached his big 18 milestone and it was stolen from her not only by him, but ""by the daughter who spent years of her life watching her mother go through enormous pain &amp; sacrifice... it's a betrayal I never saw coming.""

--She goes on to say more about how I should have known that she didn't know, and won't believe I didn't. How she would never do this to my dad, and that my dad isn't even planning this trip for my brother, he's planning it to hurt her, and doesn't care about my brother's birthday. She says my dad and step mom go on vacations all the time, so why didn't they bring my brother on those instead of this one, when I was already going to see them next month anyway? 

--She says I could have told him it wasn't a good time to go. (It was a great time for my dad and my boyfriend and I, plus I was happy to be able to spend a birthday with my brother who I haven't spent a single ""so important"" birthday with in years.) and I ""could have done what you did to me when I've tried to go up there"" (I told her no, it wasn't a good time.) But instead, I chose sides and hurt her. Choices have consequences, and now the consequence is our relationship. Dad's goal has finally been obtained: taking her kids away. 

I decided to respond, told her I would only say one more time that I wasn't a part of some plan that doesn't exist, and that I was sorry that she felt as though we stole something from her, but the reality is that, that isn't the case. I told her she wasn't entitled to our birthdays or anything in our lives since we are both now adults, and the day is about him, anyway. I told her about how she acted when she was here, and that her constant victim playing is exhausting and I'm concerned for her. I told her I loved her, that I wanted the best for her, and when she was ready to let go of the past and move on, and can stop making everything about hurting her, then she could call me. She's the only thing standing in the way of her happiness.

She sent 2 more long messages (we don't really talk on the phone much. Neither of us ever call the other). The first one saying how it's amazing how we're the only ones who think this, but all her friends ""see the truth"". She even had to go sit with her pastor because she was so heart broken and even he told her it wasn't right. It seems my brother told her that he thought she knew about the trip, didn't realize the timing of the days, and forgot that I would be here for his graduation. She says this is my dad's manipulation. She's not gonna explain anything to me anymore because it's clear that I view her so negatively, and view my father so highly (To be fair, guys, my dad put myself and all of my things outside for my mom to pick up because they thought I was my mom's spy, and I bought into what my mom was saying and didn't like my father. We didn't talk for a yearish after that.) She says I don't love her, I know what love looks like because she's demonstrated unconditional love to me my entire life, and this isn't it. I'm lying to myself and i'll regret this forever. 

The next one calls me heartless for talking about my problems and not having empathy for her own. She says how she went through so much with her mom abusing her, fighting with my dad during and after both pregnancies, have that same man spend years trying to take her kids from her, then her daughter grows up to be just like him. She's been in more counseling hours than I could imagine, dedicated her life to Christ because it's the only way she wouldn't have ended her life years ago, and that I know nothing about true depression. I know nothing about her except what I chose to believe. She asks how I could call her a victim, that sounds like my step mom. She has many friends who've seen things with their own eyes and wouldn't call her a victim. I've placed misplaced blame on her for my own pain growing up because her only other option was to give us up and that was never an option for her. I abuse her because it somehow makes me feel better about myself. She doesn't allow pain to turn her into someone who hurts those who hurt her, including how I treated her while she was here. I'm blind to who I am. I never send so much as a card for holidays (I got her a birthday present, and mother's day card, and a Christmas present last year, as well as a call for thanksgiving. I don't participate in any other holiday.) but she sends me all kinds of things for all holidays, never let a single one go uncelebrated. But this is how I feel, since she has no right to be in my life &amp; this is how I treat her after she moved me to (snowy state) in the dead of winter (I originally wasn't planning on taking her up for my move, and could have easily done it without her company, but decided to invite her because I knew she was sad I was leaving), then that's fine. No more relationship for us. She loves me as her daughter, but doesn't like who I am and won't allow that in her life. This is how a nonvictim behaves. She prays for me, and says ""I pray that you always know how much you are loved even when everyone around you is telling you all the reasons why you aren't loveable"" Until the healing of God brings us together again, she releases me.

I'm not going to respond, I guess. I'm sad to know she isn't going to be a part of my life anymore, but at the same time I can't deal with this shit. I hope one day she figures out that she's the problem.

"I[23M] don't want to have sex with my Girlfriend[25F] because of her insecurities during sex and nagging post sex. What should I do?


 I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year now and things for the most part have been great. However, lately things in the bedroom have become frustrating and have really been turning me off from wanting to have sex with her and I don't know what to do.


The sex is usually very good for me and I always make sure she is enjoying it as well. She never turns me down for sex and is always up for it when I initiate sex with her. The bigger problem is after we are done having sex she always complains. Sometimes its little subtle comments like ""well if we didn't have sex all the time I could have gotten this done"" or just flat out saying ""I'm tired at work all the time because we had sex"". It's extremely frustrating because she never complains and never turns me down before sex yet complains after.


**edit**: We got into an argument a few weeks back and her big thing was ""I always give you sex and I'm always tired or can't get things done when I need to because we were having sex"". When in reality we only have sex a few times a week(sometimes only one or two times). There have been a few occasions where we've had sex during the day and needed to do errands that had to be postponed because of it. She seems to stick to those few times and forget that... well it was just a few times and since she complained about it the first time I've never done it again. Now she sticks to those snide comments every chance she can get after we have sex. It's beyond frustrating to hear.

Plus my girlfriend has gained some weight over the year we have been dating and it has made her really insecure. I don't mind it and I still find her as beautiful as the day I met her. It's just that lately when we have sex she gets upset about her body and tries to hide away from me by keeping most of her clothes on to shield herself or forcing me to turn out the lights... 


This has been turning me off so much. I have sat down and tried discussing with her, but she just Stonewalls me and says snide/rude remarks about how I'm always demanding something. Then when I get fed up with dealing with her acting like that she breaks down and cries apologizing and nothing ends up getting done.


**edit2**:I've asked her to please not be so negative before, during, and after sex. She tends to berate/put herself down because of her looks and or body image. I've asked her not to feel obligated to have sex with me and to turn me down if she wasn't feeling in the mood. 

I've told her that her lack of initiation or enthusiasm when it comes to anything sexual makes me feel like she doesn't want me.  I've even told her all the things I've listed in this post.

I've asked her what's wrong if anything on my side that I can change that would make things better. 

I'm a very direct person and also I've been raised to be an open person and have never been afraid to say whats on my mind. I've told her everything I'm posting here in this thread and even some of the things people are recommending me as I've thought about this subject before.

Nothing really seems to work. She just gives me this look its a deadpan look. It's one of those looks where you know the other person really isn't paying attention. However, she is quick to pick out one or two words from everything I've said and throw them back at me like I was trying to insult her in some way.

I don't want to break up with her because other than this I think she's great but... lately I enjoy masturbating more than even bothering with sex... Is there anything I can do?

**edit3**: I'm very conflicted after reading some responses. I feel like breaking up is the easy way out. I've always been raised with the ""diamond in the rough""(is this the correct saying) type mentality. Where If do my best and try my hardest things will play out perfectly in the end. However, I can't honestly tell if it's me thinking negatively and things in this relationship are better than I think they are or they're really as bad as I think they are and I'm telling myself everything is going to be alright.  Sucks. 

  ---
**edit4**: We went to dinner earlier and had a good time. We took her car because she wanted to take me to a restaurant I've been wanting to eat at for weeks. After we are heading back and get in the car she looks very upset. I was surprised because I didn't know why she was so upset we just had a good dinner and a good time. I ask her if she is alright and she says shes fine and just doesn't feel good and that her clothes are feeling ""tight"". It was depressing because I was just having a good time and then she starts cold shouldering me and acting upset. As we are driving her phone is going off a lot and she looked at her phone and seemed even more upset. I asked her if everything was alright and who she was talking to because I was worried something came up. She ignores this for a bit and then shows me its her friends texting her. I asked her if everything was alright and whats going on to which she snaps and said that I'm being nosy and that it's none of my business what her and her friends are talking about. I told her I was honestly just worried about her because she was looking at her phone and seemed even more upset afterwards. 

She told me that she didn't like the way I was talking to her and that it's not fair that she takes me out to eat and then I get upset..(I wasn't even talking most of the way). So I sat down before she dropped me off and told her that we had some problems that we needed to talk about and they are making me feel depressed. I reiterated a lot of the things I've said in this post and some mentioned comments. I did however leave out any sex talk as I didn't feel it to be an appropriate time to talk about it as the issue here was her negativity about her body causing her to lash out at me.

She told me that she didn't want to talk about anything and wanted to leave. I told her that until she was willing to talk things out with me and have a proper discussion with me about our problems without getting upset I think we should take a break. She drives off taking my phone and wallet with her(which she just returned everything intact).  Then messages me saying that she ""can't believe I did that and that she never wants to see me again""  and she drives over to my place to drop of my phone and wallet and looked to be dressed up and had her friends in the car... figured she is going out and partying I guess(which she never does with me).

Surprisingly once I got started and the words came out of my mouth I felt a lot better. Her response and the way she is acting makes me feel better because I know that I tried everything I could and that it's out of my hands at this point. I feel quite calm and relaxed right now... I am not sure how long this feeling will last but for now I don't feel as bad as I thought.

**edit5**: I in response to /u/Spektor0925 comment of ""She was cheating on you, or planning to, guaranteed.""


When we got into that first fight that I mentioned in my edit. I saw that she had unblocked her ex's number from her phone and he tried to call her while I was there. I asked her why she unblocked him and started talking to him to which she said that she was upset and angry at me and that she figured that by unblocking him it would make me upset.
I highly doubt she cheated on me thus far. Actually that is the only thing I'm confident she hasn't done. What I do agree on is that she might have been planning to cheat on me. After seeing her going out tonight I have a feeling that she wants to get back at me. Don't want to think about it much because I know it will get to me.


**edit6**: She lives down the street from my house and I know she went out with her friends so I went over to grab my stuff because she is very possessive with my stuff and I know I wont get them back If I didn't get it myself.

Her mom was home which is weird since she doesn't live there. In the over one year we have been dating I've only had two conversations with my GF's mother (she lives out of town at least 10 hours away from where we live) but I've met her quite a few times just never talked much. She asked where my GF was and I told her I wasn't sure and that she went out with her friends. Conversation continues in a friendly manner and I inform her that we were taking a break from each other at the moment.

Her mom then informs me that there are some things about my GF that I should know.

She said that my GF is very stubborn and has always throughout her life been unwilling to compromise about anything. She said that she herself has always just let my GF have her way when doing things because otherwise it makes her extremely upset. She told me that my GF has always has body issues since she was younger and that she tries to make improvements to herself but gets upset when she doesn't see the results she wants. She her own mother said that she tries to avoid her sometimes because she feels that she tends to get easily upset and lash out when things don't go her own way.


I am not sure how I feel about this. Her mom told me that the only way to deal with her is to let her have her way all the time. She told me she thinks I'm a good boyfriend to her and that she can tell I've been extremely patient with her and can tell I've been taking care of her. She asked me if I would continue to be patient with her and work things out. I didn't really respond much after that as I packed my stuff and left...

"I [27M] gave what I thought was anonymous donation to my ex's family [25F] but she apparently knew and just texted me


To make a long story short, this girl CRUSHED me. The 3.5 months we spent together felt like the start of the healthiest, most organic, and loving relationship I'd ever had. She was romantic and extremely giving and heavily invested herself in me and my family and I in hers. She wheeled me out to meet various family members and then dumped me out of a blue less than a month after I met her grandparents. And it wasn't a situation of not getting along with her family, because they all loved me and she's already expressed to me that her mom missed me.

Her grandmother was dying when we met. And then she passed. My ex left for a week when it happened and came back afterward to tell me that we were through. No conversations. No explanations. Barely any emotion. Just gone.

I've avoided contact. I've been investing in myself. I've started dating again. I've been coming to terms with her as a person and that she probably wasn't in the most mature place for a relationship. History of bailing whenever things get real. Never having been in love. Just ending a presumably good relationship out of nowhere without even trying to resolve problems. I'm still really sad about her leaving, but I've been making steps to move on and that's just how it goes.

But her family joined a charity for the illness that took her grandmother. I gave a donation to them under 'anonymous' with only my billing information tying it to me. But I guess her family could tell where it came from because she texted me this morning to thank me for it.

I haven't talked to her in weeks. I didn't want to talk to her. This wasn't supposed to be a means of communication. It was just something I did because I care about her and her family and it felt good to do. Of course I want her back, but it isn't going to happen. Talking to her isn't good for me. And now I feel like I've been thrown back into it.

Advice?

EDIT: *sigh* I gave a polite response and she asked how I was doing. I sat on answering for a while and then was curt at first, but felt bad a few hours later after getting out of the gym. So I elaborated a little bit. She responded curtly. This is pretty much what I was trying to avoid.

-----

tl;dr I gave an anonymous donation to a charity that my ex's family is sponsoring for their deceased grandmother (who I met). They apparently knew it came from me, because she texted me this morning to thank me for it. I've been avoiding talking to this girl because she crushed me and I don't need to embroil myself in the pain that comes from dealing with that. I just wanted to do something nice because I care about her and I care about her family. But her sending me that text has put my foot back into that emotional spiral I've been distancing myself from this past month. It isn't like I don't want her back, but I'm trying to not entertain that fantasy. Advice?"

"My [29F] boyfriend of two years [38M] won't leave the apartment his husband died in. How do I convince him that this is no longer healthy and is stunting our relationship?


My boyfriend, Matthew, is an incredibly sweet and hardworking man. We've been together for two years and have been friends for nearly ten years. Five years ago, Matthew's husband (Hei) passed away after a brief but intense fight with cancer. Our friend group was devastated by the loss; we all loved Hei and we loved them together, and for the first few years, Matthew didn't grieve in what most of us, myself included, considered to be a healthy way. He slept with Hei's clothes, talked to him as if he were still in the room, and often times carried his ashes with him to do everything. Now, I understand that everyone mourns in their own way and none of us ever dared to say anything, but needless to say, we were relieved when Matthew finally had Hei's ashes interred and started going to therapy.

About three years after Hei died, Matthew and I began casually dating. I am a graduate student working on my doctorate in education and I don't have a lot of free time, but we know each other very well and it was easy to be together. Additionally, we both have a very intimate knowledge of the other's grief and that removed a lot of the delicacy surrounding Hei's presence in his life. Not that this should matter at all but more as a matter of propriety: the fact that Matthew is bisexual and was previously married to a man is a nonissue for me.

Fast forward two years and we've developed a very strong, incredibly healthy relationship. We spend our time very wisely, are very much in love, and are so happy together. The only sticking point, and it's becoming a bigger one as the possibility of getting engaged one day looms, is that Matthew refuses to leave the apartment that Hei died in. He's had three opportunities now to end his lease and will not do so. He's gone as far as to state that, in no uncertain terms, he will die there too because it's where Hei died. My fear is that this last holdover will never go away and I will either have to move into the apartment with him, which seems like such a mar to Hei's memory, or we'll have to break up because we can't live together. 

If what he needs and wants is for me to live there with him, I would do it in an instant. He means the world to me and he is happier than he has been in nearly five years. I am okay with not being the love of his life; I would never want to pretend like that wasn't Hei. What I am not okay with is the idea that he's so attached to the apartment because of what it represents that he'll never be able to heal that last little bit.

Reddit, I just want what's best for him. Is it indelicate for me to voice these concerns to him? Should I just accept that it's not going to change and move in there with him? To be clear, I'm not ""weirded out"" by it or anything. I just don't want to tarnish my friend's memory is all.

Many thanks if you've gotten this far.

EDIT: u/DiTrastevere suggested that I include this information and made a good point regarding its importance. Matthew used to have terrible anger problems. He was violent to a fault when the least bit inconvenienced, very quick to retaliate, and very hateful. Hei brought a calm and guidance to his life and I'm proud to say that none of us have seen the least bit of a regression since Hei's death, but I believe that Matthew associates his own goodness with Hei. It is possible that he is holding onto the apartment as a means to ensure that he has that cornerstone to his serenity and is worried about regressing to being an angry person. I had not considered that and am grateful for the insight.

"My [30M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years wants to instigate a weekly out-of-the-house date activity when we're already very busy.


I love my girlfriend very much. We’ve been together for 3 years, have lived together for 2 (no kids). In the last year, we’ve moved to a different city where we don’t really know anyone. We’ve attended a few Meetup groups and met a few new people, but nothing major. We both work from home, so we’re around each other a lot—but also, we don’t really go out and do things that much because we’re both pretty much workaholics. When we go out to dinner once a week, we talk about work a lot. We go on day trips when we’ve got a spare bit of time. We really enjoy travelling together and often do weekends away every other month or so.

I’m a bit of an introvert and she’s more of an extrovert, so I understand her wanting to get out and do more stuff together. We both travel a lot for work together—since January, we’ve both flown out of the state at least once or twice a month, which tends to be very exhausting.  

I’m not against us doing more things together—in fact, I think it would be great to get out of the house on a regular basis and get to know the city more. However, I’m not sure about the frequency and the types of activities. We’re both very busy and I think a weekly activity might be too much. (I should probably specify that she doesn’t want a weekly “go out to dinner and see a movie” type of date—she wants us to do more elaborate activities like rock climbing or bowling or going to shows, etc.).

What I’m trying to get at is, how often do you guys do a specific weekly activity with your SO? Planning and booking things is time-consuming and I don’t really have the imagination nor the desire to sift through Groupon and bicker about things to do. I offered we could maybe take a fitness class or something together (we've both kind of been skipping the gym lately) but she doesn't seem convinced. She’s really set on the idea that we need to do some sort of crazy fun activity every week. Am I being unreasonable in thinking that’s too much?

So basically, /r/relationships: what’s a good, regular date night routine for two people who work from home and are always busy? Should I give in to this idea of a weekly date activity? Is it sustainable? Right now we're talking about it maybe being every two weeks. (I argued that if we'll ever have kids, we won't have time to do a weekly date thing, and she replied that's exactly why she wants to do this now).

It would be great to know what other people’s date night routines are like—I don’t want her to plan all these crazy things and then be disappointed when we get too busy to do them. 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to instigate a fun weekly ""date"" activity when we're already crazy busy and travelling a lot--what's a good compromise?

EDIT: Wow, thank you all for your amazing advice and comments! I've read through them all and will try to reply to as many as I can, but right now, I just want to thank you all for taking the time to listen to me whine and help me understand why date nights represent a lot more than just planning activities--I guess I had my head too far up my ass when I wrote this post. So, thank you, Reddit--I will have a talk with my girlfriend today and spend some time organizing some quality time! :) :) :)"

"My [22F] boyfriend [24M] thinks I'm not being supportive of his hobby. Am I being unfair?


Josh and I have been together for 4 years. We recently moved to a state where marijuana is legal and he started smoking weed. I had no problem with this -  I used to smoke a lot of weed, it doesn't really appeal to me anymore but I don't judge people who smoke.

But after a few months of smoking he's started to consider himself sort of a ""weed connoisseur"". He likes to sample different strains of weed and write reviews of them on his blog, which means that he spends most of his free time smoking weed. He spends a lot of money on it too, he once bragged to me that he ""only paid $70 for an eighth of this dank shit""  and to be honest it was really shitty looking weed. I wouldn't have smoked it if it was free. 

I should note that it hasn't affected his work or finances. He has a creative job where many of his coworkers smoke, and it pays well enough that he can afford to buy tons of weed. But it's putting some strain on our relationship. When he gets high all he wants to do is lay in bed alone and browse the internet or play video games. We used to do a lot of fun things together but now, as soon as he comes home he gets high and ignores me.

I brought these concerns up to Josh and he got defensive. He said it's a hobby, like wine tasting or being into coffee, and I didn't understand how much it means to him. He also claimed that writing reviews on his blog is basically like scientific research - I've read his blog and there's nothing scientific about it, it's just pages of rambling about how ""dank""  and 
""fire"" the weed is. But some other things he said stuck with me. I'm worried that I'm judging him too much and putting down something that's important to him.

I guess my question is, am I being unfair to him? After all it's his money and he can afford to buy the weed, it isn't impacting his professional life, and I guess it's a bit selfish of me to want him to give up his hobbies to spend more time with me. But I do think his habits are getting excessive. Even when he's not high all he wants to talk about is the ""terroir"" and ""mouthfeel"" of the latest strain or whatever.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Am I being too harsh on Josh? If not, how can I get through to him without sounding dismissive or insulting?

So I posted a mini update in that thread and thanked everyone but I want to thank everyone *again* for some really helpful and really kind comments. 

Now...

I got my money today. :) But I had to really push for it. 

What happened was... just last night I got a speeding ticket while I was heading home after class. It was the only time I've *ever* been pulled over and the only time I've ever gotten a ticket, but it was a good excuse for my mom to scream at me and tell me how irresponsible I am and that she'll be driving me to and from school from now on. 

I know it's not good to get a speeding ticket. I should've definitely been paying more attention. But it felt like such an overreaction to me. Driving me to and from class because I got *one* ticket? So I put my foot down. I told her she can take me off her insurance if she wants but that I wasn't going to be treated that way when I've never done anything wrong before and that I wanted my money because clearly the car was a problem. 

First, she tried to tell me she isn't going to *give* me a car for no reason. I reminded her that that money wasn't something *she* gave me and it's mine to use as I need. 

Then I just locked myself in my room so I wouldn't get yelled at for crying. Then today I reminded her that I was serious about the money and that I wanted it. She tried to brush it off but I kept pressing. Then, she told me that I need to pay for insurance (I know) title and registration (I *know*) and that I can't pay for a car. I told her that either way I wanted the money and she told me that if I want it so bad, I can pay for everything else myself and to never ask for anything again. Pads, food, whatever. 

So. We went to the bank. It was less money after my school laptop and then she took out more for a credit card she *let me* use and had said before I didn't need to pay. 

But at least I have what's left which is about $7,600. It's not a lot, and I think I'm still going to go through with the car thing but first I want to find a job (seriously, 100% considering stripping at the local place right about now...) so I know I can pay for gas and other expenses like oil changes and basic necessities.

TL;DR: Got the money! :) Still need a job. Mom is still less than nice. "

"UPDATE: My (23F) boyfriend (23M) of 3.5 years put an offer on a house without talking to me


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/667xoq/my_23f_boyfriend_23m_of_35_years_put_an_offer_on/ 


So, after we had this fight, we both kind of apologized even though I was still upset and then he revealed that he was upset with me for not being excited about him putting an offer on a house, which he didn't get btw. 

Well a couple days went by and a lot of you had it right. He broke up with me. But here's how he did it. He called me earlier today while I was at work, and when I didn't answer, he decided to write me a letter which he then emailed to me. He explained why he was breaking up with me, which was mostly because neither of us can fully follow our dreams and still be together without being long distance, which I guess he doesn't want to do anymore. 

Which isn't necessarily a bad reason but here he is making decisions for both of us like he always did. And an email? after three and a half years? I mean come on. He wrote at the bottom of the letter that I could call him if I want but what do I even say? 

I'd like some closure I guess but I don't want to get overly emotional on the phone and let me him know how much he hurt me but I also feel like my relationship can't just end like that? Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? and also how to get over such a long relationship where I'm living alone in the city I moved to for him?
