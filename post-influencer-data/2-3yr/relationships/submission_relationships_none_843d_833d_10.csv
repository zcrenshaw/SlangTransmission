"I've [F25] returned from a month long trip and my roommate [F22] has moved all her things into my room and has been living there, with no intention of switching back.


Hi there. I'm writing this on a throwaway because to be honest I never thought I'd need to post here but what can you do.

So I moved into this flat about 8 months ago. I met ""Lana"" online on a roommate website, and we clicked well. She's a bit younger but seemed mature. We quickly agreed to be roommates (both of us were under time constraints to find a place to live) but have got on really well so far (up until this).

Our flat is a two bedroom, and to be frank, my room is clearly the better one. It's bigger and has built in wardrobes. When looking for the flat, I found the place first on my own and put down a deposit to take it off the market while I found another roommate. The flat was perfect, cheap rent and my aunt manages the property, so I was keen to snap it up before anyone else did. The area it's in is popular so I wasn't really worried about not finding someone to room with.

Because of the above and that I was there first, I took the bigger room naturally. When showing potential roommates (including Lana) round, I was sure to show the smaller room and say ""this would be *your* room"".

We moved in 8 months ago, and it's been happy families. Never heard Lana complain about her room. Because I have about 6x the wardrobe space that she does, I told her she's welcome to store her off season clothes in there, or whatever she wants to store, as long as she's not popping in every morning to get dressed. She was happy with this.

Just over a month ago, I went travelling. Now I'm not the biggest fan of having people in my room, but I told Lana if she had someone stay (her sister, friends from home) they could sleep in my bed. She said thanks, and as she's been such a great roommate and rarely has guests except her boyfriend, I didn't worry at all.

I came back yesterday. I was exhausted from the flight and travelling, and just wanted to shower and sleep. As I walked in Lana was in the living room with her boyfriend. We said hello and hugged, had a very quick catch up, blah blah. Then I dragged my suitcase to my room, opened the door and found it full of stuff that was not mine. I kind of yelled ""what the fuck?"" and briefly thought I was so jetlagged I was confused, but opened the door to Lana's room and saw all my stuff.

I walked into the living room and asked Lana what was going on and she said ""Oh sorry, I forgot to mention, we put my stuff in your room just because it's bigger and you weren't here and you said I could use it."" I was honestly so tired I could have passed out then, so I probably wasn't in the best state, and told her to move it all back immediately. She said they were in the middle of making dinner and I looked tired so I should have a sleep. Her boyfriend then said ""And anyway, you pay the same rent so isn't it fair that you both get the big room at some point."" I was getting really frustrated and could feel tears welling up (hysterical from lack of sleep) so I just said ""We'll deal with this tomorrow, and it's getting moved back"" and then I went to sleep in *not* my room.

I've woken up now and I'm so pissed off. Lana's at work so I can't talk to her but what should I do when she's home? I feel like this is going to turn into an argument, I don't think it'll be as simple as ""okay let's swap now you're home.""
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I went travelling for a month and told my roommate she could use my room for guests if needed. While I was gone she swapped all our stuff and moved into my much bigger and better bedroom. Never had a problem with her before but she doesn't seem like she's planning on swapping back. What do I do when I speak to her after work?

EDIT: I've taken the advice of most people on this thread and moved my stuff back. It's taken hours and I'm knackered but I think if I left it another night it would be a real problem. I sent her a text when I was almost done (incase she kicked up a shitstorm and came home) to say ""Hi Lana! Hope you're having a nice day at work. Just to let you know I'm moving my stuff back into my room, didn't want you coming home and walking into the wrong one! :)"" (Yes I'm petty.)

I'll be talking to her when she gets in because this is out of character for her, to the point of it being *bizarre*. She's never been anything but a model roommate, so I'm gonna give her a chance before we're donezo. If she wants to be reasonable and have a chat about rent portions I'm happy to do that. She's never had a problem with the rent before, and honestly I've never had uneven rent amounts in any place I've ever lived (whether I had a bigger room or smaller room) but a lot of people here are saying it's the norm so I'm open to talking about it if she's not ridiculous.

EDIT 2: Lana should be home in a bit. I'll update when I can.

**EDIT 3: Hi everyone, I've got about a million messages asking for an update but last night was a bit mad and I'm still pretty jetlagged so sorry but I went to sleep. Anyway, here we go.**

**So as you know, I text Lana to tell her I moved my stuff back. She didn't reply to me, fine whatever, but she didn't kick off so I figured we were okay. I told my Aunt what had happened, who was as baffled as all of you, and I told her it was probably all sorted, just keeping her in the loop. I also told my boyfriend, who works about 5 mins down the road. He offered to come round, incase Lana's boyfriend came round, but I told him not to because then we're ganging up on *Lana*. He insisted on going for a ""coffee"" with his mate a couple roads away incase we needed backup. Which is a bit ridiculous but very cute of him.**

**So I did get myself a glass of wine while waiting for Lana, not because I was nervous I just like wine, and she came home. I was sat in the living room and gave her a very cold ""hi"" when she walked in. She sort of froze, bag in hand, and her eyes darted between me and my/not her/our bedroom door. She blurted ""did you do it!?"" and I said ""what, move the rooms back? Yeah of course."" and her eyes went all wide and she dropped her bag and ran into the bathroom. I could hear her talking on the phone so I was like yipeeeee I guess Tom's coming round fuuuuuun!**

**I  heard the door unlock and I was about to go full hulk on how psycho she is, when she came out of the door and stood between our bedrooms. Their doors are adjacent and she just stared between them both, breathing heavily? It was really odd. Then I noticed she was crying and getting a bit panicky, so I asked what was going on.**

**She burst into tears and said ""Omg he's going to kill me"" and just sobbed so yeah it was the boyfriend's idea completely, as a lot of us suspected. She's honestly always been a perfect roommate, which is kind of why I came to this sub. If she was generally an arsehole, I would have known how to act, if you know what I mean? Anyway Lana has a bit of a breakdown, and it turns out POS Tom has always been a bit of a POS, very jealous (which I always saw hints of, but Lana never mentioned so I didn't), and has amped up his POSishness while I've been away. When I left he just finished school and basically moved in unannounced, and when she'd mention he hasn't been home in days, he'd give her the ""what, don't you love me, I treat you so well, you're so selfish, blah blah"" shit and refused to move. She showed me the texts he send her, absolutely horrific stuff, things like ""ring me in the next five minutes or we're over"" ""send me a picture of you at your desk with something showing todays date so I know you're at work"", just abusive stuff.**

**ON TO THE ROOM: As we guessed, he moved it. He did it while she was at work, which is actually a bit gross thinking of him going through my stuff, and I'm considering somehow implying I have crabs or something he could catch just to make him squirm a bit, but I'll work on it. lana came home and said what are you doing, he made out it was just temporary and that I wouldn't mind (such a gentleman speaking on my behalf) and he would move it back, and he was doing ti for her and she was so selfish etc. When it got a few days before I came back, Lana suggested moving it back, and he completely denied he said that and told her it was her idea to move it and he only did what she told him but it's staying now or she'd be sorry.**

**So basically Tom is a prick and Lana sobbed and apologised and cried and I fed her wine. She didn't want to see Tom (who obviously assumed he lived there now) so I text him from her phone saying our Landlady (my aunt) was coming round for an inspection and staying for dinner after with my family and he couldn't come over tonight. He sent a lot of begging, whiney texts, and then went on the offensive and called Lana a liar, so I rang my aunt, *explained everything* and had her write us a fake landlord email mentioning the visit and how she was looking forward to fajitas (because she's an absolute babe and I make good packet fajitas), which we forwarded on to Tom. He left her alone for the rest of the night, apart from a few texts.**

**I'm not entirely sure what we do about Tom. Lana sounds like she wants to break up, judging from her crying and screaming"" I hate him, I hate him, I hate him"" into her wine. I think she's scared to though. I checked with her and he doesn't have a key, so that's a relief. I've told my aunt everything and she said she is happy to ban him from the flat, but Lana would need ot break up with him first and get all that sorted.**

**Thanks everyone for the advice. I know it wasn't the most popcorny update, but hopefully Lana will be okay, and we're going to be doing some girly shit this week and avoiding Tom and yeah, god knows what will happen.**"

"Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [29 M] of two years, he's in Vegas with his coworker [32 F] and didn't tell me she's there


My boyfriend of two years recently left for a trip to Las Vegas with his mom and two sisters. I was not invited, but as I far as I know neither were his sisters' boyfriends so I didn't think much of it. 

Yesterday his sister shared a video on Instagram, and in the video you can clearly see him in the background hanging out with his female coworker. He never mentioned anything about her being there, so I'm feeling a little uneasy. I though I'd wait a while for him to bring it up in case he just happened to bump into her down there, but he still hasn't said anything, even though he's been texting me about other less important things this whole time. 

I've met his coworker a couple times and she seems like she has a bit of a crush on him, and they text each other pretty much 24/7 which has always made me feel a little weird. I've never said anything about it because I hate to come off as the jealous type and I really don't mind if he has female friends, so he shouldn't feel like he has any reason to hide her being in Vegas with him. 

I don't think he would ever cheat on me, let alone in front of his family, so I have no idea why he's hiding this. Am I overreacting? Should I confront him?

"Me [26F] with my boss [4???M], his wife yelled at me and made me uncomfortable


 Hi everyone. I've got a fairly urgent problem and I need some advice from people who don't know the individuals involved because I don't want people taking sides or anything. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have a corporate job that's pretty grueling and has a lot of hours put in. Don't get me wrong, I love my job but we go into this knowing that we need to be reachable and in touch at all hours. Which is why we have corporate phones. Last night I was trying to call my supervisor (let's call him Ben) because he asked me to call him when a document came in so we could discuss next steps (he of course went home because perks of being the boss etc, and I stayed at work). At about 8.30 I received the info we wanted and gave him a call on the company phone. His wife answered. I introduced myself and asked to speak to him. She asked what it was about. I told her that it was a client matter, and she started asking about the client and basically interrogating me. I told her that I couldn't answer her questions, and asked again if I could speak to Ben. She hung up. 

I sent Ben an email explaining that the information had come in but that I couldn't reach him. He called me back and we discussed work. I did not tell him about my encounter with his wife. Now, I've slept on the matter and I'm wondering if I did the right thing. Should I have said something to him and to that end should I tell him? Should I involve HR? I have had no issues working with Ben but I've been thoroughly discomforted by his wife's behavior, and I'm not sure if I should be covering my own ass on this or if I even need to. I could really use some advice.

"I (25F) am getting incredibly frustrated with the sleeping situation now that I live with my boyfriend (25M)


My boyfriend (25M) and I (25F) have been dating for a year and a half and have been living together for 6 months. Everything has been going well except for our constant fighting about sleeping. 


The issue is pretty much that I cannot sleep in the same bed as him, due to multiple reasons. 


When I first moved in I found the mattress to be incredibly uncomfortable, so I slept on the couch until I caved and bought us a new mattress and bed frame. I thought that would solve the sleeping problem, but after a few days of sleeping in the same bed as him his snoring would keep me up and I couldn't sleep. We did sleep together in the same bed at my old place when we had sleepovers before I moved in but his snoring has gotten significantly worse since then and it is now louder and unbearable. I believe it might be due to weight gain and how much he eats before bedtime, and he has a couple of drinks in the evening, but he refuses to do anything about any of those things so it is what it is. 


So due to the snoring I was getting incredibly frustrated and sleep deprived, so I set up an air mattress in our second bedroom (which is also used as our storage room) and have been sleeping on the air mattress for basically the past 6 months. 


In addition to the snoring issue, he needs the bedroom to be toasty warm and dead silent, whereas I need the room to be an icebox and I need a fan or a white noise machine going. We really weren't meant to sleep in the same room together lol.

I am sick of sleeping on an air mattress and I can feel myself getting snappy with my boyfriend all the time now because I am just so angry all of the time! I have never been like this before, I have no idea why I am getting like this. 


I have told him that I just want to sleep on a real bed for a full night but he refuses to sleep on the air mattress or the couch because they aren't as comfy as our bed and he can't get a good night's sleep. He says he absolutely needs a good night's sleep because he can't perform well at his job without it. I am getting resentful because it's like his sleep is more important than mine. I've mentioned that I want to put our new bed (which I paid for myself) in the second bedroom for me and he can sleep on the old one (we still have it, it's just sitting against a wall because he didn't want to throw it out) but he says that won't work because there is no room for a queen sized bed in the second bedroom. He's right - because the second bedroom is mostly taken up by all of his ""storage"" stuff which he won't get rid of. 


I am not sure what to do. I am so frustrated and I feel like there is no solution. We can't move to a 3 bedroom apartment because the cost of living in our city is outrageous and we can barely afford the 2 bedroom that we have now. After re-reading what I wrote I know I must sound like a salty unreasonable person, but I can't help but be mad and frustrated at not being able to sleep in a real bed. Am I being unreasonable here? Is there any solutions to this issue? Help!!

**[Update] I told her and she took it very well! She said that it's not a big deal to her. Even though she does want kids one day she said she's fine with adoption or visiting a sperm bank.**

**She had some questions about testosterone levels, performance those kind of things. I explained that it's not a problem for me and everything is fine in that department.**

**Then she asked me something I never prepared for. She said ""So, do you have an implant down there?"". For those who don't know, you can get pseudo testicles if you lose one/both. They put them in, tie them in place and Bob's your uncle, similar to breast implants after a mastectomy. I always knew it was an option but I have never really cared about levelling my lopsided equipment. Thankfully this was just a curios question and not a deal breaking one. I told her I don't and she said ""It's okay, just don't be surprised if I start making jokes about it"" I told her that's fine because I do the same thing, we shared a laugh and that was that, life went on as normal.**

**Thank you everyone who commented with advice and sharing your similar experiences, they were all very helpful! You collectively gave me the ball to tell her, and I thank you all :)**

Edit: Throwaway because my friends and family know my main account

Edit 2: Thank you very much for your helpful comments, I only replied to a few but I read all of them. I have decided to tell her tomorrow morning as it's 11pm here in the U.K, she's asleep and I'm quite tired myself. Again, thank you for the comments they were very helpful.

I lost a testicle when I was 12 to testicular torsion (I'll leave you to Google it. Just don't look at the images) the doctors didn't get to it in time so it died and needed to be removed. Other than the pain, I didn't really care. I wasn't happy it was gone, but I wasn't sad either. I had more of a ""Shit happens"" approach to it. And life went on as normal.

Fast forward a few years to 19 year old me and I get a call from my doctor, it turns out that when this happens they usually do a sperm count after the healing process but because I hadn't started puberty it got postponed. The results came back and it looks like the fella is even lonelier than I first thought, he has no swimmers either, I am his only friend. 

Lucy (Not her real name) is a very sweet, kind, gentle hearted girl. She's always cheerful even on her bad days, has an amazing and sometimes dark sense of humour and I love spending time with her. We just click, as soon as we meet we're laughing and having a great time within seconds. I'm really committed to her and I'm afraid that she may want kids one day and I won't be able to provide that for her, it's tearing me apart. 

Btw I call him the lone wanderer. 

**TL;DR**

 lost a testicle when I was 12 due to testicular torsion, doctors waited until late puberty for a sperm count, turns out I have billy no mates between my legs. Not sure how to tell the girl I'm dating."

"[UPDATE] Me [24f] with my i-don't-even-know [24m] of 4 months, spending a week in a remote cabin, help??


original post is here: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/687bms/me_24f_with_my_idontevenknow_24m_of_4_months/

this is really late on account of how impossible it is to get wifi but oh my god. thank you all so much. I wasn't expecting the outpouring of ass-kicking and goodwill that you guys delivered. and it WORKED.  I'm a little emotional. ;_;

basically i followed your advice, put on my big girl pants, and had the best vacation of my life. the cabin was AMAZING. I never thought it would go that well. chopping wood, baking bread, home cooked stew every night, hot cocoa, wool sweaters, fires, long walks in the woods, the whole ~cozy domestic~ nine yards. we could see our breath indoors the whole week, so getting out of bed was a challenge. 

speaking of bed: now that we didn't have the logistics problems that we had at work, things were...considerably better. to put it mildly. if you want a spicy detail, let's just say that tying knots is normally my job.

Basically we went on a honeymoon. I know people who have done exactly what we did for their actual honeymoons. I didn't have The DTR Conversation at the end of the week but...I don't care? The next time I can feasibly see him is in six months, so we're staying in contact and I'm not going to ask anything more of him. 

I guess that vacation was comparable to taking mushrooms--awesome, but it feels like almost cheapening the experience to immediately crave another dose. Sure, I'll be torn up if we never see each other again, but I'm just glad we were able to share that time together.

"I [30F] found out the real reason why my dad [51M] ""couldn't afford"" to give any gifts for my newborn daughter, and he might be cheating on my stepmom...


So my husband [30m] and I just had our first child a couple weeks ago. Our families were really happy for us. He and my mom divorced when I was a kid and I lived mostly with my mom, seeing him a few times a year for visits. We've never been that close but not on bad terms either. He married another woman (I believe she's 40-45 y.o) maybe 8 years ago. They ended up moving a few hours away so I don't see them much now except some holidays. 

He had told me apologetically before the baby was due that he probably wouldn't be able to afford much for her/us because he'd taken a pay cut at work and they were struggling with having enough to pay bills each month. At the time I thought this was weird, his job doesn't seem like the sort where that happens but I believed him and said I understood and it was fine, just come and see the baby at some point after she's here. I also offered to help him financially if he needed but he declined.

Now today something happened that made me realize he was lying. I have a friend who lives in their city and she sent me a screenshot of something on another girl's Facebook page. It was a picture of that girl with a guy and the caption ""The amazing man who's helping me upgrade my chest lol"" or something like that. My friend was asking if that was my dad and it was (but he doesn't have an FB). I asked what was going on, she said this girl she has on her FB had been posting over the past few weeks about getting a boob job and how excited she was. Turns out my father knows her and is paying for it. Oh and she's also apparently 21 and in college.

Sooo I was pretty grossed out and pissed, he's got enough money to throw on this but somehow can't afford a small thing for the baby. And looks to be cheating on my stepmom. I showed my husband and he suggested I call my stepmom and figure out if he'd lied to me about the paycut, that way I'd have more evidence. So I did and when I mentioned it she had no idea what I was talking about, his job is fine. She also said he'd told her he bought gifts for the baby and was mailing them to me in both their names. Obviously I never got anything. She didn't know why he'd lie to both of us but apologized and said she would ask him about it. 

I guess that would have been the time to tell her about the picture but I just didn't know how. I know it sounds dumb and shitty and I know she deserves to know if he's cheating. But how do you break something like that to someone. And I feel just kind of stupid like my evidence is a picture someone posted on Facebook? It could be someone he's friends with joking around or something. I mean I know there's PROBABLY something going on but… I keep second guessing myself.

So anyway we just ended the call after that and now I'm struggling with whether I should tell her and if so how... Or should I confront him first?

I'm also still just feeling upset that he doesn't seem to care about me or his granddaughter. He's only called once since she was born. It's not about getting gifts as much as him not showing any kind of interest. But apparently that's because he's more interested in buying some college chick a new rack. 

How do I handle this stupid shit?

TL;DR my dad lied and said he couldn't give anything for my new baby because of financial difficulties but he's not in any financial hardship, he's instead paying for a much younger girl's boob job. I have some evidence but I don't feel like it's a hundred percent solid and am not sure if/how I should confront him or tell my stepmom what he's doing. I'm also just mad and disgusted."

    He was up very late last night. I didn't think anything of it and I went to sleep. When I woke up I was grumpy that he had woken me up very early despite going to bed very late. He got mad that I pushed him away from me and blurted out that he found my ""old Reddit username"" on ""sub related to work"" and read every post and comment that I had made. Keep in mind I post almost daily, and comment on A LOT of posts. He referenced posts/comments that were made 4-5 months ago and I have hundreds of posts/comments. I feel so violated and he keeps calling me stupid. Saying I'm dumb for being upset. Isn't the premise of Reddit being able to post anonymously with judgement. He keeps mentioning things that he read and it is making me more upset as the day goes on. I could understand if he had a bad feeling that I was doing something inappropriate and searched for me but literally every post revolves around work and has NOTHING to do with him or our relationship.
  How do I explain that this is a huge violation of trust and is not okay? Also we are ""friends"" with our employers and I wouldn't put it past him to get mad at me and show them my posts which would be devastating. How do I wipe the account so he can't do that? Do I have to individually go through and delete each comment/post?

TLDR SO lurked Reddit until he found my username so he could read my posts and make fun of me. Need advice on how to explain this is NOT okay and need to know how to wipe the username.
EDIT: now I am worried he has lurked into my devices. I'm getting password notices on all of my devices except the one that he did NOT purchase. 
EDIT: you have all confirmed my feelings that I am in an abusive relationship. We live together. Have our whole lives intertwined. Idk what to do. I have asked him to find another place to live but responds by saying ""I will never leave"" despite him being unhappy. 
 

EDIT: he just urged me to change all of my passwords because someone is trying to hack me. I said I would wait until tomorrow and he said I should do it now on his iPad or extra phone (he has 3 phones) because I am at risk of being hacked NOW. Hmmmm...
EDIT: so many edits so sorry! So he just got home from a looong day of work. This morning was a super stressful morning. He had some business transactions that weren't going as planned and was already at a high level of stress when the Reddit comments were made. He walked in the door, happy as a clam. It is his birthday. He's had a nice dinner and drinks out with his business partner. I was already in bed with the lights off. He is being especially quiet and respectful and asks if I am awake. He asks what is wrong and I tell him. He laughs and says I completely misunderstood him. His ENTIRE demeanor has changed. I don't know if it was the stress from earlier but even his voice is different. I tell him I'm still upset. He asks if it's about the business transactions, I say no. About your Reddit comment and for calling me stupid for being upset. He said that is not how he meant it at all. That he got curious because I always talk about this particular sub and am always posting in it and he wanted to see what it was about. That he scrolled through and found me by the name and the way I spoke. He said he was so proud of me because normally I am very shy and don't speak up for myself but am very good at my job and it's great to see me have a support system of other people who have been in the same situations that can give and take advice. He is still pressing to change the logins for my accounts and devices. This whole situation was definitely not just a one off. It is representative that his moods are very erratic and unstable, and not fair to me. Living together is not working. We are in a very small place and I will further push to fix the living situation.
EDIT: SO I TOLD HIM THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE and he threatened to go to my employers to ""burn me down"" get me fired, share confidential information. Refuses to leave. Says he gets mail here and I have to give him a 30 day notice. In between being hateful and mean he then breaks down and begs me to take him back. All while threatening to take my phone away because the line is in his name. I am so lost. I don't know what to do. "

"Me [21F] with creepy dude [23 M] during internship


I just started a 10-week summer internship in a city 2000 miles away from home. I am not very good at making friends but soon established a small friend group with about 10 of the other interns. 

There was this one dude who just didn't fit in, he was kinda weird and invasive and nobody really felt comfortable around him. But I didn't want to be mean so I tried to include him in conversations and be nice to him. 
The first time we ever hung out I was talking about my boyfriend a LOT so I know he knows I have a long term relationship, but he sent me a private message saying how he ""wished he had met me when I was single"" 

I ignored that message and didn't talk to him until he asked me if I wanted to go watch the sunset with him. I told him no and that he was starting to make me feel uncomfortable. 

The next day he sent me a private message asking if we could talk about it over coffee and I said no because #1 he is really starting to give me bad vibes and #2 he's not the kind of person I would ever really start a friendship with naturally. 

I thought this was the end of it but this morning I woke up to a 2 paragraph message where he accused me of ""sending him signals"" that he read as me wanting to hook up with him. As I mentioned before I am not good at making friends and maybe a little socially awkward but I am 100% sure I was not intentionally sending him ANY sort of signals (and I also talk about my boyfriend quite a bit).

I still have 9 weeks left in this internship but now I feel trapped because this dude is making me SO uncomfortable. I want to have fun and hang out with my friends but he seems so delusional that I feel like if I hang out in the same group as him he'll think I'm ""leading him on"" or something.  I really don't think I was leading him on in any way but it makes me feel dirty just knowing that he thinks that. 

What should I do? Should I just ignore him? Talk to the other interns? Talk to the intern director? I'm trying to get a full-time job offer from this internship so I don't want them to think I'm starting a lot of drama, but I also just don't feel safe around this dude anymore.

"UPDATE: My (F 30) cousin (F 23) is cheating on her husband (M 25) and I don't know what to do!


Original here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dm6e8/my_f_30_cousin_f_23_is_cheating_on_her_husband_m/

So my cousin, Jane, flew out to see her husband, Brian over the holiday weekend. Turns out: Brian had the receipts! Apparently Jane left her social media accounts opened and Brian reached out to the guy Jane slept with, Alex (lets call him that). 

Apparently Brian and Alex were very good friends. They all worked in the same area, remember? So Brian texted Alex, Alex confirmed it straight out. 

Brian said he needed space, which is perfect since Jane still had to return to my state for more training. However, Brian had some rules to help their marriage heal, primarily that  she needed to delete Alex, along with some other guys Brian found questionable (with good reason, she was flirting with others) from her life. 

Jane has returned now and is 1. Indignant about Brian's invasion of privacy. 2. Did NOT delete ALL the guys, she just named the couple she kept female names. 3. Thinks Brian is ""giving up on the marriage so easily"" (EXCUSE ME?!) 4. Is looking for revenge on Alex because he did not warn her that Brian had contacted him. She wants to make him suffer like she is. 

She also did not to Brian she slept with Alex this most recent time. You know, the one after Jane married Brian.

"I (31m) think my fiance's (33f) new work environment is toxic for our relationship


So long story short we've been together 3 years, living together a little over 2 years, and engaged for about 9 months. We have a great relationship, never fight or argue, and get along great. 

Except for the last 3-4 months.... My fiance got a new job where she works in an office with 3 other women, all of whom appear to completely hate their husbands. These women do nothing but bitch, bitch, bitch about anything their men do. At first she would come home and tell me these stories, and how crazy the ladies are.... But now she's best friends with the manager, who actually does seem to have a pretty terrible husband. Dude sounds like a dick. 

Fast forward to now, and the past few months. She's suddenly complaining about me and everything I do, to me, and sounds almost just like the girls at work. Who at first she said sounded ridiculous.. pointing out every little tiny mistake, or problem, or thing I forget. It's like suddenly I can't do anything right although I was so wonderful for the past two and a half years... I don't get it. 

Don't get me wrong I know relationships change, people get complacent and maybe get new habits.. and I'm not perfect. I know there's things I can be better on. But I do almost everything at home. I'm like the man of the house yet I also pay the bills and I'm a stay-at-home mom because I work from home.. I make breakfast every morning. I take the kid to school, I pay the bills, I take out the garbage, I clean the house, fix things, run ALL the errands, I do almost everything.. everything. Honestly I don't think most men would do as much as I do. Not to brag. 

Honestly I feel like the girls at work are rubbing off on her and she's​ starting to nitpick everything I do. 

How do I bring this up without causing an issue, or sounding like I'm arguing her points. Some are valid yes, but most are not.

Tl:dr girls at my fiance's work all hate their husbands, and their negativity seems to be rubbing off on her. She's slowly starting to nitpick everything I do. After having a wonderful 2 1/2 years prior with no issues.

"I [24F] went home to visit my mom [50s]. My formerly abusive father [50s] wouldn't let her spend alone time with me. I don't think I can keep visiting her if it means seeing him.


My mom has been cat sitting for me for a few days, and the original plan was for me to come pick my pets up late afternoon today. 

However, circumstances changed, and I ended up having an opportunity to come into town last night. As soon as I knew it was possible to come into town earlier than expected, I called my mother and asked if that would be okay. She enthusiastically said yes.  

My mother and father are married, but I don't have the best relationship with my father. He is a severe alcoholic, and when I was growing up he was abusive to me, my mother, my adopted sister, and even an ex-boyfriend of mine. My mother has forgiven him for a lot, but I haven't. He hasn't physically abused either of us or had a drink in about a year, but my relationship with him is strained at best. When I visit home, I go to see my mom. My dad and I are cordial, but don't spend any time together alone. 

Now, when I still lived at home my mother and I used to go to garage sales together on Saturdays. It was our own special time to spend together, but since I moved a few hours away around 5 years ago, we haven't had the opportunity to spend a lot of time together. Since it turned out I would be coming into town Friday night, I asked my mother if she'd like to go to a few garage sales together the next morning. She seemed excited and said that the weather forecast was calling for rain, but that she'd love to go if weather permitted. 

So, I drove into town after I got off work last night. I came with only the clothes on my back, since I had other weekend plans and was only planning on spending a few hours with my mom the next day before heading back home. When I woke up this morning at my parents house, my mom was already awake and dressed. I asked if she was ready to go to some garage sales.

My dad answered for her. He told her no, she wasn't going because she needed to help him with yard work. I tried to point out that my mom and I had made plans the night before, but my dad said the only way she could come with me was if I volunteered to help with yard work when we got back. 

Reddit, the only clothes I had with me were business casual work clothes. I was wearing a silk top, long black slacks, and ballet flats; not the kind of clothing one does yard work in. I tried to articulate this and say that if I had been asked in advance to help with yard work, I would have packed different clothes. My dad's only response was that he hadn't decided to do any yard work until he woke up that morning. 

My dad ended up yelling at my mom about having a lazy, selfish daughter and told my mom she wasn't allowed to go anywhere with me since I was ""refusing to help.""

So I left. I gathered my cats and drove 2 hours back to the town I live in now, without having spent any time at all with my mom. 

As I was leaving, she tried to apologize to me. She said she was sorry she wasn't able to do anything with me, but that she didn't have a choice. 

I left in tears, angry at both my parents. Angry at my dad for being controlling, and angry at my mom for letting him control her. 

I love my mom with all my heart, but I hate my father just as much. It's getting harder and harder to fake getting along with him when I go home to see her, and I don't know if I can do it anymore. I'm afraid now that any time I go home my dad can make up some reason to keep my mom from spending alone time with me. What can I do?

***TL;DR: I had an opportunity to spend some time with my mom this weekend, but my abusive dad wouldn't let her because I wasn't able to help them do last minute yard work. I don't think I can keep going home to see my mom if it means having to be around an abuser. What can I do?***"
"I [24f] am a nanny to two wonderful kids [10m, 9f] with divorced parents [m/f late 40s?]. How can I politely and professionally get these parents to stop calling my phone to contact their kids?


The title sounds a bit weird. Let me elaborate...the kids parents are divorced, with the kids going to their dads every other weekend, and at their moms the rest of the time. The mom and dad have an amicable relationship, but there is definitely some tension between the families. When I am with the kids at one parents house, the other parent will usually call *my* cell phone and ask to speak to the kids, at which point whichever child I hand the phone to disappears into their room anywhere from 15-45 minutes to talk to the parent calling. And then the parent wants to talk to the other child, which is another 15-45 minute conversation. This habit has really started to bug me. The mom is especially bad with this. On Fridays when the kids are at their dads she usually calls me at the worst time (i.e. when I'm in the middle of cooking dinner and need my phone for recipes) and proceeds to talk to the kids for usually 30-45 minutes (the dad usually talks for about 15-20 mins). Both households have landlines, as well as both parents having their own cellphones, and the step parents have their own cell phones (99% of the time at least one parent is home when I'm there, if not both). The kids even have their own iPad and iPod that they can use to call or Facetime! The dad usually calls 2-3 times during the week, and the mom always calls on Fridays when the kids are at their dads. 

Do you guys think I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal? Should I just let them use my phone? Is there a way to professionally and politely ask both parents to stop calling my phone to talk their kids unless its an emergency and they can't be reached in other ways? 

Thanks in advance for any advice :)

"Me [28/F] with my roommate [31 M]. He invades my personal space, hugs me, and is too needy.


Hi reddit! Throwaway because I don't know if my roommates use reddit. I've never posted before so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.

I moved in about six months ago, and my new roommates seemed awesome ([30 M], [31 M])! Let's call them Justin and Alex. Justin has a girlfriend and spends a loads of time away, and Alex is single. I'm in a serious relationship, and have been for 4 years.


Alex is very huggy and seems very unhappy with not having found anyone. He complains about everyone else having a partner. Recently he has taken up the habit of hugging me every time we see each other. I don't mind hugging but he does it repeatedly and seems to enjoy it too much. You know the kind of embrace you'd like to break but that just goes on for a few secons too long. He always hovers around me telling me how he loves having me home, and constantly engages me in conversation even if I'm busy or want a moment of peace and quiet.

Justin's cool. He gives me the personal space I need and when it's only me and him, we can go about our own business without problems. Alex, on the other hand, needs my active presence, and constantly wants to interact with me.

Here are some examples of his behaviour towards me:
We work in the same building and occationally have lunch together, also in the presence of mutual collegues. Usually when we get up to leave, he hangs back and kind of corners me. Once he breafly placed his hand on my lower back to kind of lead me through the doorway. On another occation, he even kissed me on the cheek as a reation to me sayiing how glad I was to have found such a cool appartment. Both times I got really unconfortable and didn't know what to say or do, especially because of our colleagues being there as well.

After these two situations, I did confront him once (in the presence of Justin) saying his hungs made me uncomfortable (putting most of the blame on my need of personal space). After this, he has stopped hugging me as much but I see it's a conscious battle every time. He still hovers around me as usual.
  

I don't think he has a crush on me, he seems more the desperate type (he comments on my girlfiends' and even my sisters' appearance and keeps asking me if they're single). I really like him as a person and would want to know how to go about the problem. I need my space but would not want to move out. How can I put an end to his behavior without upsetting him and losing a friend? Please help me reddit!

"My parents [50s M/F] don't approve of me [27F] living with my boyfriend [30M]. It's causing a major divide in my family.


So to start off. I'm an only child and am incredibly tight with my parents. We've always had a dream relationship, so this is hitting me harder than it would for some people.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. In that time, we've fallen head-over-heels and agree that we'll probably get married someday. While we're not ready to be married yet, we know it will happen. Over the last few months, we floated the idea around of moving in together, and finally decided to take the plunge and do it. We're so excited to start this new adventure together.

My parents, on the other hand, are not as excited. They've always loved my boyfriend, in fact there's a running joke that sometimes they like him more than they like me. They also are firm believers that a couple should not cohabitate until they're married. For this reason, I didn't tell them we were talking about moving in with each other until the decision was final a few days ago. They were blindsided. My mom is a bit more understanding than my dad, she sees why I've made this choice and is trying to understand my rationale and beliefs as they compare to hers. However, my dad completely shut down when I broke the news to him. He is now saying that he didn't realize that he raised a daughter that has so little respect for herself, and that he will never enter my boyfriend's and my new apartment because our values don't align with his. He doesn't see why we couldn't just get married and do this first, when I've tried to explain to him that I believe that this is a relationship step before marriage. My mom is caught in the middle and I see how it's destroying her to see my dad and I at odds like this. 

I'm at a loss. I feel like my dad has completely turned his back on me overnight, and I don't know how to salvage the relationship. I understand you can't change people's opinions, but I wish he could understand mine like I understand his. Further, it's breaking my heart to see what this is doing to my family that, before this week, was amazing and close and pretty much perfect. I feel more alone than ever, and all I want is to run into my parents' arms when I'm not welcome there. What was supposed to be a happy week of new things is turning out to be the exact opposite. Is there a way to bounce back from this and help my dad see my way of thinking, or even just salvage what's left of our relationship?

So my dad grew up really wealthy and has never worked a day in his life since high school. He spends most of his time laying around playing video games with my younger brother 14m and as he jokes making babies with my mother. He has a few hours of the day 1-2 where he locks himself in his office and spends time to himself. my mom always has different explanation as to why he does this ""he needs time to himself, he has work to do, he is talking to family."" When he doesn't get this time he is very agitated and is off for the whole day. My dad is also very dodgy about his parents who live only a few towns over and who we are not allowed to mention or ask to meet because my dad gets extremely agitated and angry when we do.

My mom is a helicopter mom and constantly makes sure that me and my two siblings 14m and 13f are doing our homework, keeping up with studies and socializing with friends. None of us go to private schools our dad insisted public school were fine and even bought a house in a town with a good public schoolthat we barely ever go to. Whenever I want to hang out with friends we must hang at that house and I cannot bring them to the house we actually live in because ""it's private.""
 
In the past when my friends dad's have tried talking to my dad even go out of their way to invite my dad to ""hang out"" my dad tends to make up excuses and dodge interacting with anyone. One time my close friends dad was just trying to have a conversation and my dad cut him off and told him ""this conversation isn't going anywhere and I have a lot of important stuff to do"" he proceeded to just get into the car and leave. I felt awkward the rest of the day and came up with some half lie about how much work he has (he doesn't even work!) 

I'm just really worried about an issue happening at this party most of my friends parents seem to get along really well while my parents seem to seclude themselves. My mom is much mor social and outgoing and she says my dad is as well but his attitude seems to show otherwise. 
 
Tl;dr: my dad will be taking me to a birthday party and he seems to hate interacting with people. Is there anything I can say to him to make the day easier on both of us and to try and avoid any bad interaction between him and other parents? "

"Pet crazy neighbour (f50's) is threatening to call someone about my gf(f26) and I(m26) abusing our pets


I live in an apartment with my gf and right next door we have very nosey and grumpy older lady who loves to tell us we are abusing our animals.
We have an older dog and a cat.

Right next door to our apartment is an off leash dog park that the neighborhood dog lovers have kind of agreed would be a leashed dog park when there are other dogs around(rare).

I took classes with my dog so we can go to off leash dog parks and throw a ball around without me worrying about my dog running off.   He is very well trained so I feel I have every right to have my dog off leash when no other dogs are around so he can chase a ball.
My neighbour HATES this and constantly complains about it to us and the apartment managers.   They don't do anything because it's an off leash park.

Now the next issue is that my gf likes to occasionally take her cat to the grass on a leash.
My dog is old so his before bed time walks consist of us going to this field and letting him do his business and walk around and graze through the grass for a bit before bed.
This is about 11 pm every night when there is nobody around so my gf will occasionally bring her cat on a leash( I can literally spit on the dog park from my window so it's not far) so that cat can walk around and lay in the grass.

My neighbor hates this too.  She said were trying to make an indoor cat an outdoor cat and it's going to kill the cat etc.  
We just ignore her and move on.


This brings me to today's incident.
My gf and I have work schedules where it keeps our dog at home for 4 hours by himself everyday.
When I get home, I will sit down on the couch and take my boots off to put on flip flops or running shoes so I can take my dog to the park and throw the ball around.  

Well today I came home, dog was super excited I was home.   I sat on the couch to undo my boots, my dog jumped up on the couch with me and next thing I know I'm waking up 2 hours later.
Dog is passed out with his head on my lap.  
I get up and take the dog out and when I come out of my apartment, my neighbor swings her door open and starts screaming at me that I didn't take my dog out right away and that I'm abusing him etc.  She said she s going to call someone to have my animals taken away blah blah.

At this point, I'm just sick of her bullshit and wondering how to handle it.  Do I call the cops saying she's harassing me?
I'm not sure where to go from here but it's driving me crazy.
