Link to the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ekb9g/i_27m_told_my_friend_30m_that_his_girlfriend_27f/

Here I am again with good news. 

I went back to the pub and told the manager ""yo I really need that surveillance footage mate. My buddy's girlfriend was making out with another guy and you need to help me, ya know?"" 

He of course agreed and asked me on a date afterwards - I'm taken so I obviously said no, but I did show the footage to my friend who dumped his girlfriend.

Just kidding. I went back to the pub and politetly asked the manager for footage of that night. He agreed to show me (!!!!!!!!!!) and then I showed it to my friend. I left a really big tip and I wanna give a shout out to u/reelniggaonehunna for the idea. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!

My friend was devastated, of course. He had been dating Candice for 8 years. But he said ""I knew you weren't lying, I just couldn't accept it"". He also apologized deeply for bringing up my sexuality and after a long talk, I decided to forgive him because I understand that he was in a bad place. He dumped his gf. 

Thanks for all the advice, r/relationships. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 

tl;dr: I showed the pub footage to my friend and he dumped his gf.

"""UPDATE"" My [24f] boyfriend [25m] of 8 months is starting to police my eating habits and I'm tired of it.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53jjzt/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_of_8_months_is_starting_to/ 
  

So in case anyone is wondering turns out my (now) ex's mother and two sisters had him convinced I had some kind of eating disorder and would nag at him about it and make him feel like crap for ""letting"" me hurt myself. All three of them are obese so idk why he weighed their opinion on nutrition so heavily. I pointed that out (with more tact) and we had a much better conversation about why he needed to lay off on how I eat. He did make a lot of effort to keep his opinions to himself but could never completely let his worry go. 


Officially this isn't why we broke up but it was kind of like the shattering illusion from HIMYM that kind of made me start noticing how he's quick to be arrogant, condescending, and patronizing when he thinks he's right and how he buys into every dumb thing his family tells him without question. Stuff like that.

"My roommate's [29M] girlfriend [2?f] told me [22F] to dry my clothes somewhere where my roommate can't see them, bc it makes him uncomfortable. Help?


I've been living with my roommate Marco since January. We met on Craigslist and we're good friends/roommates, but not bffs. We hang out when we're both at home but are good with respecting each others space and bringing up household issues when the need arises.

Our apartment is loft-style, and has two floors. On the upper floor there's my room and the main bathroom/washer and dryer, downstairs there's Marco's room and the kitchen and living room. For as long as I've lived here, Marco and I have both used the railing on the upper floor to air dry our laundry. I usually only put things that shouldn't be machine dried (sweaters, cheap f21 shit, bras, etc) on the railing, and use the dryer for everything else. The clothes on the railing are usually left overnight and then put away in the morning.

Marco has been seeing this girl Tiffany for a few months now - I've only actually met her a handful of times, but from what I've seen he seems really happy with her.

Last night however, Marco and her came in when I was doing laundry, and I came downstairs to say hi. When I went back upstairs to put another load in, Tiffany followed me into the bathroom and shut the door. She then said ""I didn't want to say anything about this, but it makes Marco really uncomfortable that you hang out your lingerie for all the world to see. It's really inappropriate and you should keep them in your room."" I kind of awkwardly apologized (I know) and she left, and didn't say anything to me for the rest of the night. 

Now that I've had time to reflect on what she said, I'm thinking that was super weird and inappropriate. Besides the fact that the only things drying when she came over were ratty sport bras and wool socks, she has no right to tell me where I can hang my clothes. No idea if Marco actually feels uncomfortable (he probably would've mentioned it outright, though he dries his boxers on the railing too so idk if he'd have a leg to stand on) but I don't know how to deal with this when I see Tiffany next. Do I just ignore her? Say ""thanks, but I live here and I can dry my clothes wherever I like""? Bring this up to Marco? Please help.

**EDIT:** I want to thank everyone for the support once again :) it's been much appreciated. I'm going to stick around on this account for a bit because my now ex knows my primary account and I want to fly under the radar. I'll stay anonymous on this account but feel free to message me if you need any advice and I'll be on subs like r/anxiety and r/ADHD and r/chronicpain :) 
 

I'd like to thank everyone for all the support and advice the other night when I posted the question. I decided to wait until this weekend because I was supposed to do something with his family and his family was nothing but sweet to me...or so I thought.

Tonight gave me the perfect opportunity to break up with him. I was supposed to go to his house tomorrow night and when I asked him what the plan was, he told me ""Eat dinner before you come because we're eating together as a family. Maybe you can get some Chipotle before you come over."" I asked him ""Why am I not invited?"" and he said ""I don't know, but I'll ask"". He texted me that ""My dad said we don't have enough food or space for me."" 

It was lovely to know that his family has been two-faced to me this entire time and that they don't want to welcome me, but that's beside the point especially since I don't give a shit anymore. I told him ""All I wanted was to feel welcome and accepted in someone's life. I'm done dealing with all of this and I deserve someone who respects all of me and who will stand up to their family when something isn't just."" 

He got pissed about how ""I am disrespecting him"" and how ""standing up to his family would disrespect him."" Then he went on about how ""they pay for the mortgage so he can't tell them what to do."" I told him ""Yeah, like you don't pay my rent like you shouldn't be telling me what to do."" 

He asked why we can't just be peaceful? and I told him to stop texting me and leave me alone. I haven't heard from him since and I feel relieved finally. I'm a bit sad, but it's more disappointment it didn't work out. I know that I'll have a happy life and find someone who will love me eventually.

"My brother [27m] does some really creepy stuff and I'm [21f] done with him.


Well, hey Reddit. I'm desperate.

My brother is really really creepy. Like really fucking creepy to the point where I look at him and I have serial killer thoughts. Then I realize what I'm thinking and I feel guilty.

Yesterday, for example. He picked me up at the uni and was supposed to take me to the mall, because I needed to buy some things. I realized the route was different and I asked him where he was going. He didn't say anything. I kept asking where we were going because I knew we were far away from the uni and he was driving faster and faster and I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. Then he casually went back to the mall, I got out of the car and said he didn't need to drive me back. He just went away.

Sometimes on holidays I'll be alone and he'll stand behind me and scare me. I told him multiple times to stop and he didn't. He's been doing it since we were kids. Sometimes I would wake up and see him standing in front of me while I slept. Last Thanksgiving I was sleeping and woke up to him sitting on the edge of my bed, speaking french (?????????). 

Sometimes he'll show up at my college and ask to talk to me. I'll get off class and then he'll just say it was ""nothing"" and go away. Sometimes I see his car parked at my boyfriend's house. I don't understand it. I'm done with him. What can I do?

tl;dr: my brother is creepy as fuck and I'm done"
"How do I [22F] tell my nephew [3M] that his father [26M] died? My family left it up to me because he likes me the most


Hi Reddit. 

My brother died while drag racing his friends last night. I know he's an idiot for doing it in the first place. He has a history of it and it caught up to him. My brother has a son and his mother has been out of the picture for years. My nephew is going to be living with me and the whole family is on agree with that. He's staying with. sleeping right now actually.

"[UPDATE]My(26F) fiancé (27M) lied about his past crush to keep her as a close friend, should I give him a second chance


Hello again my fellow redditors, more than half a year ago I posted this question when I was on the verge of breaking up. All of your responses and PMs have really helped me and now I'm finally ready for an update. 


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4eamhk/my26f_fiancé_27m_lied_about_his_past_crush_to/


So, back to 7 months ago, after avoiding his calls and texts for three days and reading all your analysis many many times, I decided to talk to him. One of the comments really stood out to me is that the incident - and I quote - ""reveals a lot about this man's problems with emotional intimacy too, which is so unattractive"" and I was going to focus on this point that truly bothers me, rather than debating on whether or not he was telling a white lie.


Ben looked like the saddest and most frightened little animal when he came up to my hotel and begged me to let him speak first. Basically, he said that he had a crush on Pia when he was lonely and going no where in life and romanticised the idea of her by proclamimng Pia to be the dream girl to his friends, because he desperately wants to have something worth mentioning in his letters. He has since got a really good job in his field, met me who he not only has the biggest crush on, but also want to spend the rest of his life with. He kept inviting Pia because she has been part of the gang for a few years now and he genuinely thought she is good friends with everyone so it would be rude to un-invite her. As to why lie again and again about the crush, he thinks he was really lying to himself because it reminds him of that desperate and unconfident version of himself who he no longer is. Then he apologised again about the confusion and pain he brought me in the past year and begged me to stay.


I didn't think he'd came to that conclusion himself and thought it's both humiliating and kind of brave to do it. I do love this man, especially knowing that he has had some tough years, I have always been proud of who he is right now. So I decided to stay, and observe, while working on my own self esteem and jealousy issues.


We called of the wedding saying that we both have very demanding careers in the coming year (true) but stayed engaged. Ben made an effort in showing me how much he loves me, leaving me notes and little gifts almost every week. He also stopped initiating contact with Pia and has so far received one Facebook msg from Pia wishing him a happy birthday. He mentioned it to me when he saw the msg last month, and started to blame himself again for trying to make Pia more special than she is and hurting me, but I stopped him right there. I must admit that I've been on edge and constantly angry for the first few months after the incident, but no more. None of us is flawless and I'm glad that we get to grow together as a couple. 


Last night's event was what prompt me to post this update. Ben loves to write and he has read me the short stories he wrote 3 or 4 years ago about another major crush/almost girlfriend of his, whom he met while volunteering abroad in his early twenties. He has very found memories of the volunteering experience and spoke highly of her. This particular girl contacted him yesterday arranging a meet up in our city. I didn't tense up like I used to and didn't feel insecure or jealous. Ben went on to say that he has politely declined and wish to spend the weekend with me, and want to take me to a nearby Christmasy town, as we've both been very busy recently and haven't been on as many dates.


So that's it I guess. No more lies and doubts, just communication and understanding. I want to write down this update to let people know that it's possible to rebuild trust, just be honest with yourself and with each other. It's ok to be vulnerable in front of each other and if you can help each other through it, you will grow stronger together as a couple.

"Wife [36] of 12 years suddenly wants kids. I [37] don't know what to do.


Been married 12 years and we've been together for 15.  I have never been unclear about not wanting kids since day 1, and she whole heartedly agreed.    It was actually one of the things that helped us bond at the beginning.  She grew up the younger sister of a severely disabled brother, and was basically forced to be a caretaker for as long as she can remember.

Earlier this year she made some comments about ""if we had kids"" and we laughed it off, but then the comments started happening more frequently.  She finally told me she has had a change of heart and wants them now, before we are too old.  Well, I have not had a change of heart.  In fact, I'm more against the idea than ever before for many reasons.  

I don't blame her, and I'm not mad at her for it, but I am at a total loss of words.  Our marriage is great, our house is almost paid off, our plan to save as much as possible, retire early, and travel around the planet is currently 2 years ahead of schedule.  Everything is/was going so well!

The idea of divorce seems so crazy, but I feel like she has put me in control of her destiny.  If I deny her, then she will resent me forever.  If we divorce, she'll be sent out into the dating pool as a 36 year old woman looking for someone to start a new life and family with.  I'd assume (hope) that would add a few more years into the equation, if not more unless she was just looking for a sperm donor.  

Ugh, what do I do?

"My best friend [27M] of thirteen years is bringing home his new fiancee [21F]. I [28F] want to make sure she likes me and feels comfortable!


My best guy friend from high school is bringing his fiancee to our hometown for the holidays. She seems like a really cool chick and I'm so excited to meet her! However, my relationship with my best friend is a little more complicated than I would expect her to be 100% comfortable with. After high school, we fooled around for a little while - a purely FWB relationship. It was like we were just two buds who also happened to be getting our physical needs met from each other, and I think it actually ended up cementing our platonic relationship in the end. Like, we knew we just weren't into each other as boyfriend and girlfriend and there was a very natural transition to friends without benefits. 

Presently I have a handsome husband and two young kids, and I love my family dearly. I have no attraction to my best friend. It's been about eight years since our last little fling, and I'm not sure if she has this information or not. Obviously, we're not going to be talking about it. But, in her situation, I think I might feel a little weird or uncomfortable either way. I don't want to give her bad vibes. 

I really want her to like me and I really want her to be comfortable with my friendship with her fiance. I'm worried she won't approve, though I realize that that is her prerogative and I'm not going to overstep my boundaries if she doesn't. However, this is my oldest and favorite friendship in my life. What are some ways I can welcome her to our hometown, make her feel comfortable, and make sure I get to keep my friendship? 


Some other points to consider:

*I am friends with her on social media. I can see from her Facebook statuses that she is a little bit dramatic and has some issues with jealousy and insecurity. I think it's just because she's young (not bashing or trying to be condescending - I just remember how much less mellow I was myself just seven years ago). 

*When he last came to town, they had this big video chat where they went from having an open relationship to him not being allowed to hang out with another girl alone. I'm not sure if this was because of me or not. My friend didn't think it was about me, and he thought hanging out at my house was fine because my kids were always with me, but I made sure we only met up at public places (even though I can't kick his ass at Smash at parks and restaurants and his family's houses).

*My own amazing husband is super-chill with the situation; he was even giving my best friend advice when he and his lady first started dating.

*I'm very close with my friend's family and I'm sure we'll be hanging out at his mom's and brother's a lot (like we usually do when he's in town). I don't want to eclipse her blossoming relationships with them by being my usual boisterous and rowdy self and acting like I'm family. Do I tone it back a bit?

*She's from a Central American country and by the tone of her Facebook messages, I can tell she's a little bit frightened and angry (understandably) about how certain people in our country are treating our Latino neighbors. I live in a redneck state where everybody flies Confederate flags even though we were never part of the South, but I want to show her I can be a good advocate for minorities.

*She speaks Spanish and my friend has learned her language. I understand Spanish really well from working in kitchens my whole life, and I can speak it a little. Do I need to disclose this info? I kind of thought it would be cool to figure out how she was feeling about me and shift my behavior accordingly, but I don't want to be sneaky.

Thanks for reading my long post!

First off, big thanks to everyone who supported me. Thank you to everyone who has messaged me, thank you for everyone who commented. I read through your posts multiple times, including one final time before I sent my final text to ""Jessica.""


Yes, I broke up with her tonight, not even an hour ago. After so long, I finally did what had to be done. And it sucks. It sucks even more than I thought I would, and I knew it was going to be one of the hardest parts of my life so far. 


I feel a lot of things right now. Sad. Happy. Angry. Exhausted. energetic. The whole range. I miss her already, but the barrage of texts she sent me after words solidified my position more than any advice. And it followed no reasonable narrative either. She would just switch from bitter attack to sweet talk. 


It is going to be a long, hard road. I know that, but I'm glad I've made my decision. Again, thank you so much to all who commented. You came to me when I was completely broken and helped give me the strength I needed to do what had to be done.


It is funny.... In the final moment all I could think of what the scene in Game of Thrones where John Snow says, ""I'm tired of fighting."" I have no idea why that stuck out and became so poignant in my mind, but it did.


Again... Thank you, thank you, thank you. I can't think you all enough.

Previous TL:DR My sister in law and her family moved in our house with us and I can't take it anymore !  
  
Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/588hon/we_57_m_and_51f_empty_nesters_let_my_sister_inlaw/  

Well it all finally came to a head about a week after my previous post.  On a Saturday when I wanted to mow our lawn,  my wife asked my sister in law to pick up the dog poop.  Sister in law texted my wife back and stated that she picked up about half a grocery size bag up and told my wife that she should get the rest.   This reply really upset my wife and I so we decided their dogs had to go.  My wife phoned my brother in law and explained that we had enough, it was getting to hard to have 3 dogs in the house and to make plans to move the dogs elsewhere ( we where on our way to meet my daughter and son in law at a restaurant about an hour from home, they had just announced they were expecting there first child, our first grandchild.)  

Five minutes later my sister in law calls my wife back asking what's the problem, etc and they get into an argument of what was going wrong.  It ends with my sister in law telling my wife that if that was the way we were going to be, she was moving her family out of the house as well.  She than texted my wife that living in our house she came to believe that she didn't like the way I treated my wife, and she noticed it but that my wife was blind to my treatment of her.  Now this upset me even more, I was through with my sister in law. 
 
When we got home from our dinner out, the dogs where gone and so were they.  My wife was upset, but we were both relieved they were gone, finally some peace and quite in the house.  

They ended up taking there two dogs to my brother in law's parents house where they were constructing their new home.  Now my brother in law lives at his parents house with the dogs and the oldest teenage son.  My sister in law at first moved into her parents two bedroom townhouse with their youngest son, and traveled between the two locations.  So now they have spread their inconvenience to both their elderly parents and their kids just because my sister in law was to proud and lazy to pick up after herself and her dogs while in my house.  
 
My wife asked her why this was better than just keeping the dogs at one of the other houses while keeping her family together at our house and not spread their troubles to two other households but she didn't have an answer.  
Now in the mean time, they have finally sold their old house and my brother in law has finally got a full time regular job.  Most of there junk is still in our house (my wife moved most of it to one bedroom) and they are in no hurry to move there things out yet.  Construction on their new place is still going on, no ideal when it will be completed yet.  

Thanksgiving dinner at my mother in law's house was very uncomfortable with my SIL and BIL there with there kids and both sets of parents.  I have nothing to do with my SIL now, nor do I want to since she stuck her nose in my relationship with my wife with her comments to my wife about me.  My wife's parents are trying to stay above it and not pick sides but it's wearing on them.  My wife and her sister do still talk to each other now, but the relationship is now very cool.  
It was tough, but at least we have our house back and we are now trying to get it back in shape after our ""visitors"" left.  I'm very happy but I know my wife is still hurt and things are uncomfortable with her family.  

TL:DR My sister in law and her family finally moved out of our house when things came to a head but relationships have been damaged!"

[original post](https://redd.it/5e8b1t)

First off, thanks to everyone who responded to my post (and I mean everyone, no matter how harsh you were with me), but especially thanks to those who shared their own stories with me. Putting your own experiences out there, no matter which side you are on this, takes guts, so thanks. I read all your responses and tried to comment until the post was locked (not to sure why that happened.) I thought about everything you guys wrote, which ranged from me being a blameless scapegoat in a family of a-holes to me keeping my head in the sand about what a heinous abuser I was to my brother. Like most truths, the answer seems to be somewhere in the middle. 

After I posted I spent the next day or two thinking back on my actions as a teen and how they may have affected D. A lot of what was written in the responses didn't really fit, honestly, I never hit D, I rarely teased or yelled at him. None of my angst was directed at him, but a couple of people brought up that the tense environment I created still could have affected him. So I focused on that, and sat down and wrote an email. I apologized for being unpleasant, and creating a nasty environment at home. I apologized for dragging his name into my rages at my mom (things like, ""why do I have to do xx chore, when D doesn't?"" since he was always getting ready for some practice or game.) I apologized for calling his sports dumb and useless and comparing them to the Roman circuses to distract the masses. (yeah, I was so ""edgy"" as a teen.) In my email I told D I had been reflecting on our past and felt bad about how I treated him, and welcomed him to talk to me if he ever wanted. I didn't bring up A or B, I didn't make excuses, and I didn't bring up the wedding or why I wasn't going home for Thanksgiving. It seemed short and light, but I did feel better after I sent it off.

Then I confirmed that I was still welcome at my gfs house, bought flowers to bring my gfs parents and sent some to my mom to apologize for missing out on Thanksgiving. At my gf's family's house, I had a great time meeting everyone! It was so nice, and I think a pretty big step in our relationship. So that was all good.

But then, yesterday, B calls me up and asked ""did you hear what happened?"" I said no, that mom had called to see how my time with my gf's family went, but she didn't say anything about their weekend. So B proceeds to tell me that when the family was eating pie, my dad asks where I am (thanks for noticing I'm gone Dad!), and my mom reminds him that I'm at my gf's family, and that maybe I'd be home for Christmas. Then D brings up that I sent him an email apologizing for being terrible during our teenage years. Mom (trying to be neutral, I guess), asks if he is going to respond. Before D can say anything, D's fiancée (F) chimes in with ""well, she's still not invited"". My mom agrees that they can invite whoever they want. And F continues on about how they only want ""people who bring them joy to be at the wedding"" and I ""wouldn't be comfortable there anyway since it was a dressy occasion."" (this is news to me that I'm allergic to dressing up, since I dress up all the time for work and going out). And then (some of you guessed it) F finishes her speech with the fact that ""most of the people at her parent's church wouldn't be comfortable seeing me and my gf there."" My mom expressed how sad she was that there were still intolerant communities out there and that I and my gf would always be welcome at her house, and left the table to do the dishes. So there it is, I honestly had no idea F felt this way. Maybe she doesn't, and it's her parents or church community she's appeasing, but still, I was pretty floored when B told me this. 

At this point in the conversation B stops and says ""can you BE-lieve it?? F hates that you are a lesbian!! That's why they don't want you there!"" I stop her and say ""wait, I thought I was a toxic person?"" B says ""that doesn't seem to be the issue, huh?"" I say ""you said you didn't blame D for not wanting me there, and that I was awful to him, what did you mean by that, how awful was I?"" B doesn't really give any specifics and just says ""well, you were pretty bitchy and rude back then."" Then B tries to steer the conversation back to F, snarking about how dumb it is that F ""only wants people who brings them joy"" at the wedding when F is so intolerant of others. At this point, I ask B why she's telling me all this, and B says ""well, I thought you'd want to know how F really feels about you. I'd want to know if someone hated me."" This is all giving me a bad feeling, so I thank her and end the conversation. 

Where I'm at now: 

D: Clearly my email meant something to him since he brought it up in a non-derogatory manner at their Thanksgiving. I do hope we can talk sometime. I'm thinking what happened was, in the course of talking about his childhood while he was getting to know F, he brought up how tense I made things, and that was enough of an excuse to write me off from the wedding without going straight to the lesbian thing. 

B: My sister is a very unreliable narrator, and I think she just wants to gossip and relishes in the drama. When the family headline was ""D hates me for his childhood"" she was so quick to pile on with the ""I don't blame him"" line. Then it comes out F doesn't feel comfortable with me and my gf, and she dials it back to ""you were a little bitchy, but not bad"" and switches to ""it's crazy F hates you!!!"". I'm glad she told me, because it definitely gives me insight into the whole situation. But I don't think she was telling me to reassure me that I wasn't toxic, but rather to see how I reacted to F's opinions about me, maybe mining for more drama? 

A: I guess I could ask A about how she thinks I acted as a teen, but according to B, A and B's response to my email to D was ""when will you apologize to us?"" uhhh....yeah, I don't know about that. If they are just going to blame me for being awful, and use this for gossip and drama, well then I don't know if I really owe A and B an apology. 

Anyways, thanks for reading, sorry its another novel. Hope you enjoyed this update and have a little more insight into all my family dynamics. I know I do. Now I can go to Christmas without fear of being the ""awkward unwelcome one"", and instead be on the lookout for instigating behavior from B, or passive aggressiveness from F. "

I don't know if some of you remember my post. I was very surprised to see all the reactions, I hadn't expected so many people to react on it.


After long consideration, I tried to break up with Ela 2 days ago. I went to her place and we talked, I told her that recently I had been really sad, because I was thinking of what my ex did to me and also because my feelings for Ela weren't the same anymore.



She cried,begged me to stay, told me she had never loved me, that she just 'liked' me, then she grabbed me and held thight so I couldn't leave, she didn't let met take my stuff, she begged me again to stay, told me the alarm on her phone didn't work so I had to stay. She also used the personal thing she told me against me 'I told you this, you were the only one'.



I told her I needed a break from her, and yesterday I went back, to find er very calm, she had written down things she was sorry for, and I gave in.


However, when she initiated to have sex with me it felt so bad and uncomfortable. I realised that this was the ultimate proof that it was over.



I told her this morning that despite her changes in behaviour, which I had appreciated, I didn't feel it anymore. I assured her that the personal things she told me had nothing to do with this, and that if ever she needed me she could contact me, but that our relationship was over.


She accepted it. Thanked me for the wonderfull time she had had with me and that she knew she would 'never find someone' like me again, but that she had ruined it herself. She told me that she loved me but that she wanted to see me happy, even if it wasn't with her and that she would never forget me.



I hope one day I will find someone who treats me well (all the time), I'm still young, hopefully I will one day. Right now I will try to focus on my studies and working on myself in therapy, I need to learn how to set boundaries and remark red flags.


So, despite the fact that I feel like a jerk and that I am surprisingly sad, I would like to finish this post by thanking you all for your reactions. 
It meant more to me than you guys will ever know and touched me a lot. I hope that your reactions will help others the way it has helped me.

"My [66M] wife [61F] is taking care of her aunt [86F] and it is killing our marriage.


My daughter uses Reddit and is helping me type this today. I am at loss in what to do in this situation. 


My wife's aunt became a window two years ago. She came to live with us because she was afraid of staying alone. Since we had extra rooms and that she was perfectly healthy and fine, we decided it was okay to let her stay with us. 

Over time she grew more and more attached to my wife. She wouldn't want her to go to work because she'd miss her, she didn't want her to go shopping because it was always too long, she would follow her to parties and events even if she didn't want to go because she didn't want to be without her. I told my wife that it was becoming unhealthy and that her aunt should talk more to her friends and try to meet with them ( she has a couple friends around her age). My wife always told me that I was exaggerating and that there was nothing wrong. 

Recently, 6 months ago or so, the aunt caught a bronchitis and then another viral infection and some type of spine pain. She became very dependent on us to move her. That's when things started going really bad. She required my wife's attention almost 24/7 and would cry when my wife wasn't around. She wanted my wife to sleep next to her, feed her, talk to her constantly, not go out, not go to work, etc. 

After a week I complained to my wife about not spending any time with her and that her aunt was taking ALL of her. My wife dismissed my worries and told me that she would get better soon. After two months of her aunt acting like a baby and constantly complaining about pain, I suggested we go consult. The doctor said she was perfectly fine, nothing wrong. We had trouble believing it so we consulted different specialists and they ultimately said that if she keeps up her good health, she'd could live another 10-15 years. We met with a psychologist and he said that the aunt needs more tests to determine what she has but that my wife and I clearly need to focus on us and not her her aunt affect our marriage. 

Since I am retired, I told my wife that we should finally go take THE vacations we always wanted. I booked tickets to go on a cruise around Alaska. I even planned everything and asked my daughter [35F] to take care of her aunt. A week before going, I couldn't keep the secret anymore and told my wife what I had done. My wife was clearly happy and amazed. I finally thought we could have some alone good time. When she let her aunt know later that night it was a major catastrophe. The aunt cried, threw tantrums, called all her friends to let her know how awful we were to leave her ""alone"", she even threw herself on the ground. 

I told my wife it was time to put her in a home for elders and that she couldn't stay with us anymore. My wife refused. She said she wasn't going to abandon her and that it's hard to be old. She also cancelled our vacations and said she's sure I'd understand. It hurt me, a lot. I did end up going with my daughter instead and we had a great time, but that's besides the point. 

Now, we are selling our house. It's too big for us. The aunt has a say in all this... She requires a room with specific details such as dimensions, views, number of stairs to come into the house, etc. My wife is actually listening to her and it is making me more and more unhappy. I retired to spend time with her, our kids and our grandkids but it feels like she's only spending time with her aunt. 

We are in couple counselling, it is not helping us, I have been married to her for almost 45 years, I don't want to give her an ultimatum as she is the love of my life and I certainly don't ever want to be without her. I just want to spend quality time with her.

"Coworkers [40sFs] are pressuring me into multiple holiday gift exchanges I can't really afford to participate in [32F]


Sorry if this is long, I wanted to give the full details. I understand if you want to skip to the TL;DR.

I've been at my current job for about 4 months now, so I'm still the new girl. 

A little background; the office employees are all women, there are about 25 of us and I'm the youngest at 32. There are 4 managers. Most of the women are in their 40s or above, with semi-wealthy, retired husbands and you can tell they don't really have to work if they don't want to. Many of them go to the same church and all are extremely religious, so I'm already a bit of an outcast here.

I make just over $9/hr, and my financial situation has been very tight this year. My husband lost his job and I lost mine (we both worked retail and the company reorged), so we have both had to take pay cuts in our new positions, basically starting from scratch at new companies. He makes little more than me, just over $10. 

Between our car payments, insurance, and rent we can barely afford to feed ourselves. We applied for food stamps and were denied because we have about $4k left in our savings account that was supposed to go towards the purchase of our first home.
(we have already had to dip into it multiple times over the past 4 months just to keep ourselves fed and our bills on time) We are trying really hard not to spend it because, like I said, it was supposed to be for our first home.

Back to the work situation:

It started with an email. One of the managers was collecting money to get a gift for the HEAD manager, and instructed that the money be left for her in an envelope on her desk with our name clipped to it. 

A few days went by, and I did not contribute anything because quite honestly, I don't have anything. The manager sent another email reminding everyone to contribute and came to my desk before I left for the day, again reminding me that I hadn't contributed to the gift. 

I said, ""Listen, can I talk to you for a second,"" and I explained to her that money has been tight and that I wasn't able to contribute. I expected understanding, but instead she got kind of huffy with me and said, ""Well just so you KNOW, we do this every year and (manager) does something for each employee in the office."" She left before I really had a chance to discuss it with her further, and I sort of feel like I was being told I am expected to contribute. 

Since then, similarly ""mandatory"" collections have started for gifts for the other three managers, and a gift exchange is being done by all the workers on my shift.

We were sitting at our desks when one of them said jokingly ""I hope you all are getting me something nice this year because I just picked up your gifts today."" And they started discussing what day they wanted to exchange gifts. I kept quiet, until one of them called on me by name and asked if that day was good for me. 

I said, ""Oh, it's okay, I'm probably not going to participate."" They all got quiet and the one from before said ""But I already got you something."" and another spoke up and said, ""It's only $10 a person.""

Note: There are 5 others on my shift so even if we are doing $10 a person, that's about $50 that I do not have.

There was an awkward silence until I said, ""ok, thanks"". 

Since that happened, no one has really spoken to me. 

Now, to be honest, I was planning on quitting this job anyway, because as you can probably tell from this post it's not the most pleasant place to work. There is a lot of passive aggressiveness that goes on and I've already started looking for other jobs. However, I just don't know if I will be out before Christmas. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm dreading going to work and am having all kinds of anxiety about the holiday. We have already embarrassingly had to explain to our family and friends not to expect much more than a card this year because of our financial situation, and now I'm being gulited for not wanting to participate in five, yes five, gift exchanges at the office this year.

Even though I'm planning on leaving, it's no fun being the office pariah. How can I handle this situation with some dignity? 

**TL;DR: Coworkers are making me feeling guilty and refusing to accept no for an answer when I try to get out of holiday gift exchanges. I simply don't have the money this year. I am embarrassed and frustrated, how can I get out of this without making everyone hate me?**"

The issue I brought to you all wasn't very exciting, however things have taken a severe drop quite quickly.

I drove down to ""Jim's"" dorm on Saturday after letting him know I was coming down to talk. When I arrived and explained everything to him, how I had been asking him to give me more of his time and attention for our entire relationship, nothing had changed, I didn't believe anything was going to change, and I was ending things.

He did not take this well at all. The following two hours consisted of him asking me why over and over again, saying his life was ruined, punching things, grabbing me, promising me to change, asking why I didn't love him, the whole nine yards.

Eventually I was able to leave, and after I drove home I decided to spend the night at a friends house. Unfortunately I had forgotten that I had left my location services on (we turned these on early on in the relationship when we were making more frequent road trips to see each other in the event of a car accident or whatever), so he decided to check up on me and freaked out when he saw that I wasn't home.

I turned the service off, which prompted another emotional meltdown, and I reiterated that I needed him to stop contacting me.

Meanwhile, his mother had begun messaging me about how she hoped Jim and I will work things out soon and she deleted all the ""featured photos"" on her facebook profile except for the one of Jim and I.

Now, today is when the real excitement starts. Upon leaving my physics class this morning, I saw that I had received a message from Jim's father. The summary is that if I love Jim, I need to please give him another chance because everyone is very worried about him. Fuck that

Anyways, it made me a bit uncomfortable so I pulled up Jim's location and the crazy asshole decided to drive down to where I live and was chilling at a Walmart about 7 minutes from my house. He's also been texting my family all day, so my mom decided to meet up with him to get him to calm down.

They're currently talking and I am hiding at a Starbucks.

All in all, I'm glad I got out. I don't think this is a healthy reaction, and I don't appreciate his family trying to manipulate me into reentering a relationship I don't want any part in. I guess there's nothing left to do but ride it out and call the cops if things get really bad.

"My (21M) family just had an intervention with me regarding my GF (27F) of two years. I am so broken. I know what I need to do, but I lack the wherewithal to do it.


Before I start, sorry for the monstrosity of a story I'm sure this will turn out to be. I've got a lot on my chest. I've been dating ""Jessica"" (not her real name) for two years. It has been a rough two years. This is my first relationship, and when it began I was not in the most healthy of places. Too keep things sufficiently vague, I come from a background of death and abuse. One of my guardians, the only one that really loved and cared for me, died when I was a child. The other was abusive, really abusive. I ended up running away in my mid teens and was taken in/all but officially adopted by a former friend's (now brother's) family. I had all kind of crap that I had to work through, and I was starting to make significant progress when I got into my relationship with ""Jessica.""


She was seemingly everything I always dreamed of. Intelligent caring, empathetic, beautiful, you name it and she had it. We ended up dating when I was 19 and she was 24, and I was and am utterly devoted to her. Looking back now, red flags abound, but at the time I couldn't see any of them. There were throwaway comments about how all of her exes' families hated her because they felt she was taking away their child, how she wanted to be loved in an all consuming way, the jealousy of my family whenever I spent time with them and the guilt trips for not spending every second I had with her.

I was not (and am not) without my own problems. I mainly had problems communicating and problems with anxiety due to the fact that I didn't know if I was capable of having a healthy relationship, but this relationship was the final push for me to get better. Therapy, intense self reflection, and an overwhelming desire to finally be unbound from my past drove me to a better place. I left my darker self behind around three months into the relationship, shed that skin finally. The freedom and joy I felt upon burying those horrible habits and obsessions over the pain of my childhood, a process that took almost four years... I can't even explain it. It was beautiful, and I took this new found energy and passion and drove it all into the relationship.

It almost seemed that as I got better ""Jessica"" got worse. Her jealousy ramped up to the point that I was getting phone calls randomly throughout the day to verify where I was. She would go through all of my stuff. I was constantly accused of cheating, of falling out of love, of planning to leave her. This culminated with her hands around my neck, later claimed to be for attention because she thought I was cheating on her. I was shattered. I didn't know what to do. So I called my adoptive mother. She told me to wait until ""Jessica"" was at work, take a day off school, and pack up my stuff. I went along with this, but instead of that I ended up talking to ""Jessica."" I confessed everything to her, and she got upset with me for breaking her trust by talking to my mom. We agreed to separate living arrangements, but we both mutually wanted to continue to work through our issues. I started seeing a therapist to try to solve my cowardice and inability to confront her.

Later it became apparent that she was still going through my stuff. I confronted her about it, and she agreed to go to therapy. She quit shortly after without telling me until months later. Things have gotten better, baby steps. But the constant paranoia and every other problem are still there (besides physical violence) in slightly smaller doses. Despite all this, I love this woman with all of my heart. I would do anything for her, and I have. I've moved across state, changed degrees, done everything for her.

I recently went down to see my family. I only get to see them a couple of times a year, and ""Jessica"" refuses to go. She says that I ruined any chance of her having a relationship with them. My family has been a constant source of strength for me. They've never directly told me what to do, just given advice. This was the first time they directly confronted me. My sister was almost in tears about how I almost never see or talk to them anymore, how they think that if I continue this relationship they will fall to the wayside. My mother said that she can't tell me what to do, but that I better never start a family with this woman for the sake of any children. My father said that she'll drive me to an early grave, just like my horrible guardian did to my loving guardian. My brother said I've got to let her go for her own sake, that I am enabling her and stopping her from actually getting better through not manning up.

I know they are right. I've known that they and all my friends have been right for ages, but it has taken be over a year to get to a place where I am confronting her about the crap she pulls only about 60% of the time. I just seem to have this emotional block. I can't finish it; I love her too much and can't hurt her. I know its stupid. I know its ridiculous. I know that in reality it is ridiculously simple, that I just have to do it. But none of that is helping me actually do it. Like I said, I am in therapy and am trying to work through stuff, but I thought I would try to post to Reddit to see if anyone has been through something similar. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

"My [31F] husband [31M] wants me to stay in the kitchen throughout the long holiday weekend. Need advice.


Hi /r/relationships! 

I stayed up late so I could get some time to write up this post before I head off to bed here. Basically, the title of my post is the issue I am having with my husband right now. We spent a bit of the evening arguing about this issue, and I need some other ammo to direct towards him tomorrow on this. So, my husband ""Jerry"" (fake name/I was watching Seinfeld early) and I have been together for over 5 years now, but we have been married for close to 2 1/2 years now. I love him a lot, and we have never had any major issues. Expect, for this issue that I am facing with him right now. 

Both my husband and I have had most of this week off from work. My husband only worked on Monday, while I work from home, but I tried to get some of my projects done by Sunday night so I could prep for thanksgiving. We had a wonderful evening hosting thanksgiving for both of our families for the very first time. It was awesome! It was nice to see both of our parents and siblings come over to our place and celebrate with us. I really enjoyed making food and dessert for everyone to eat, even though both of our parents brought MORE food to the dinner. It was such a fantastic evening! 

Now, the problem lies after everyone left, and it was just me and Jerry cleaning up everything. Jerry started going off to me how he wants me to make this and that, for the rest of our guests that are coming through this weekend. Our close friends and their SOs are coming over tomorrow night for dinner. On Saturday night, my husbands friends from college (with their SOs as well) are in town and want to have dinner with us. Jerry wanted to host them at our place (keep this in mind for later). Finally, Jerry has some of his cousins coming over for football Sunday, which he hasn't seen in ages. 

Yeah, you could say we have a busy household. Anyway, Jerry was asking me if I could make meals, make snacks, and help keep our company satisfied, fed, and hydrated (laugh). So, I told Jerry that I had no problem helping out, but I wanted him to help me out too. It was bad enough that Jerry told me last minute (Monday night), that his college friends and their girlfriend/wives were coming over for dinner. I told him that he needs to help with the cooking, grocery shopping, and buying alcohol. I told him that it isn't fair for me to bust my ass all week long with constant cooking, baking, buy groceries, and constantly running out to buy alcohol. 

Regardless of everything I just mentioned, we got in a pretty heated fight for around 20 minutes or so. Back and forth, nothing was accomplished in the argument. My husband wants me to stay in the kitchen and take care of all the ""assets"" we need. I mean, it's not like I have a life here or anything?? We had to cancel plans this Saturday night, where my best friend and her boyfriend invited us over to party at her place. I know his college friends that are in town don't come in that often, so I wanted to be fair to him. But, I'm getting tired of doing everything for him without getting any help. I want him to help me, but he says that he is ""too busy"" entertaining our guests.

God, I'm just so frustrated right now. Can someone give me some thought out advice to tell Jerry tomorrow? I need something substantial that will make him consider; ""Yeah honey, you're right, I will try and help you out a little more"". Both of us are on our own roads it seems. Guess what? I'll probably end up doing all of this stuff by myself because I care about our guests, and I love my husband. I just wish I had some help...

Any advice on how I can approach my husband? 

Thank you

"Me [43M] with my wife [21F] 20 years - I did something stupid at the start of our relationship and never said a word.


Edit: Title should be 41F, not 21. 

Yes, I'm a cheater and I don't quite know how to handle this situation now. I feel I have to own up, but I'm not sure how after all this time. I left my own country and came to a city in hers with a job offer in 1999 not speaking a word of her language (she spoke English just fine, we originally met in my country when she was on holiday)

The city I was in was far away from hers and we were in a long distance relationship for two years seeing each other perhaps every month, it wasn't the best situation but we made it work until I did something stupid on New Years Day 2000. There was a huge expat party I attended. I was being flirty with a girl not expecting it go anywhere and, well, it went somewhere. I woke the next day with her in my bed and felt like shit, I felt I had to tell my girlfriend I had betrayed her. It was completely my fault and I'm not trying to absolve myself of that. I started packing, started deciding what I was going to say and how I didn't really want to be in this country any longer because it made me do things I would never have done at home. I felt lonely and tired and trapped.

However she called me up the day after and told me her mother was having a cancer scare - she had to go to her hometown right away and needed me with her for this. I agreed, thinking we would talk at some point once this scare was over. Well, days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I stopped drinking entirely (my last drink was in 2000), was much more self-aware around people. I learnt the language, made some local friends, dropped my old friends who were there for the easy money and my wife helped me through everything. She kept saying how she thought it may not work at the beginning but she saw this change in me, wasn't sure where it came from but was more in love with me than ever. 

So I buried it, I buried it at the bottom of my soul for 20 years and haven't given it much thought until recently because otherwise the guilt would kill me - which it now is. I want to tell her, but I have no idea where to even start... I even asked her if she'd want to know if I did anything and she told me no. See, the culture here is all about face and losing it or causing someone to lose it is a huge no. I know her family would pressure her to stay with me after I told her, even if she didn't want to... 

I also know I've robbed 20 years of life from my beautiful wife and never revealed what a bastard I could be.

"My [29/F] fiance's [32/M] ex-girlfriend [35?/F] texted him ""Are you sure you want to get married?""


OK, so I'm going to throw out all the relevant details so buckle up.

Background:  My fiance and his ex were together for 4 years.  During their whole relationship she had some mental health problems that prevented her from working, living independently, or driving.  They were long-distance until one day she showed up at the apartment he shared with a college buddy and moved herself in.  Since she couldn't work, he now had to support her in addition to himself; also, being home alone working all day, she started complaining a lot of being bored and lonely.  In addition, since she couldn't drive she was calling up his friends and asking them for rides any time she wanted to go somewhere.  After a year of this, he got tired of her being what he calls a ""moocher"" and asked her to go move back in with her parents.  At that point she started saying that they should get married, but they ended up breaking up shortly after that.  A few months later she started seeing another guy, and she married him two years later.  

Meanwhile, he met and started dating me a year after they broke up.  We've been together for 4 1/2 years.

Fast forward to this year:  we got engaged in February.  A few months later she texted him ""OMG are you engaged?  Congrats!  Your fiancee is gorgeous.""  A few days later she sent me a friend request on Facebook.  A few days after that, it seems, she was hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency.

Fast forward to yesterday, when I found out that a few weeks ago they had the following text conversation:

Her:  Hey can you call me when you get out of work?
Him:  Sure.
[a few hours go by]
Her:  Are you still at work?
Him: Yeah I get out a little late
Her: Oh that sucks
[a few minutes go by]
Her:  Are you sure you want to get married?
Him:  Yes I'm sure.  Did you still want me to call you?
Her:  No

What the hell?  She was her own husband, so I'm more than a little bothered that she's barging into my relationship.  I understand that she seems to be still mentally unwell, and that this is a manifestation of that (and I sympathize, because I have my own mental health struggles and I don't always act right) but this is not OK.

I don't know if I should do anything, and if so what:  should I message her and tell her to stop?  Tell my fiance to tell her to stop?  Ignore everything?  I have a fantasy of calling up her husband and saying something like, ""Tell your wife to leave my fiance alone.""

"My [26 M] girlfriend [26 F] has been spying on my facebook for years without telling me..


Apparently, she has been logged into my facebook account for the past 2-3 years without my knowledge.  I recently found out about this fact and in retrospect, it made a lot of things make sense.  I never cheated on her or did anything shady but I feel a severe violation of trust has occurred and I am thinking of breaking this relationship off.  I can't see myself marrying a person that would do something like this.  Am I overreacting?

tldr:  GF hacked my facebook and has been spying on me for years.  wat do"
"I [29 M] just refused to bring along my FIL [62 M] to a festival my wife [28 F] and I are attending


I think I should start by explaining the festival. It's at night with live bands, food stalls, art expos and such. Think of a toned down music festival. It's in a fairly large space and we'll usually walk around for hours.

So now my FIL wants to tag along. I know (and understand) that he can't walk for a long time. And we can't just leave him on his own, he can't text and calling us would be useless because of all the noise.

Basically I feel that if we bring him along, we'll have to spend all of our time hanging out with him. And he's not fun to hang around with. We have to withhold a lot when he's around. He is judgy in general, so my wife won't smoke, drink or even eat non veg (FIL is vegetarian) when he's around. Heck, even I won't.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I preventing my wife from spending time with her father?

**tl;dr**: FIL wants to attend a festival with us. I refused, but now I'm wondering if I was unreasonable.
