"I'm [28M] never had a relationship with my sisters [35F]/[31F] because of the way my culture views gender. Is it too late?


I come from a conservative Indian background that values men more than women. As a result I never really had a relationship with my sisters because we never really played together as kids and I went to separate schools. 

As the youngest kid and as the only boy I was quite spoiled growing up and it's only now that I'm starting to realize how much.

For example

- My grandparents always compliment me on my achievements, my sisters just get asked when they're getting married.

- My dad spent time playing with me but not my sisters growing up.

- My sisters know how to cook and clean but I don't because my mum does it for me. My wife had to teach me. 

- I went to a good private school, my sisters only to a public school because we could only afford to send one of us to private school and they assume my sisters would get married and leave the family. Their grades are as good as or better than mine. Both of them have PhDs, I'm just a chartered accountant. 

- My parents hated it when my sisters stayed out late due to work, they wanted them home by 7pm. Every time one my sisters want to go out late, it was a fight. I on the other hand, came and went as I chose. 

- I'm favoured now due to the fact that I'm married and have a daughter (6 months) but none of my sisters' achievements matter because they are in their 30s and unmarried.

It look me awhile a moving out of home to address some of my own issues around gender and stereotypes. By then my sisters had moved to another state together (against my parents will) because they didn't want an arranged marriage and hated the pressure so we lost touch except for texts about birthday presents for our parents or if one of us were visiting home.

It didn't used to bother me but now that I have a daughter of my own and got the ""better luck next time"" or ""I'll pray for son for you next time"" comments- I was brought really rudely down to earth because I can't fathom in my mind, that anyone could look at my daughter's face and then be disappointed. And now I can't bear the thought that she's going to grow up and know that people will be disappointed in her just because she's not a boy and I want to never talk to my family again.

It's also starting to make me think my dad must be a psychopath or something because how do you look at your daughters and then ignore them? My heart hurts when my daughter cries even if I know it's just because she needs to be fed or hates having her diaper changed- I couldn't imagine not caring at all. 

To top things off, my best friend has a great relationship with his sister. Just yesterday he posted an image to her wall on FB saying ""how to people make it through life without an older sister?"" for her birthday. She's 37 and unmarried but my friend sticks up for her all the time and his family is not as conservative as mine which helps. I'm starting to see that I should have been more the same. 

To top things off, I always see my sisters doing things together, taking trips and having a great time and I've started to realize how much that I've missed out and also how much my daughter is missing out. 

I don't know how to start making amends. I would much prefer my daughter to be around the type of women my sisters are than my own father and family. I'm already dreading the way that my family will treat my daughter. I don't want her to go through the same things my sisters did. 

It's definitely my fault for not doing something sooner- I guess it was easier to live with the status quo and not make a fuss but what do I do but I would like to change that if possible. They've never displayed any animosity towards me though I don't blame them for being resentful if they were about how they've been treated. I wouldn't be surprised if they hated me actually.

"UPDATE: ""My husband [M42] and I [M32] (together 6 years) fought last night""


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pm1qj/my_husband_m42_and_i_m32_together_6_years_fought/

I want to thank all of you for your comments and support; they made me realize really how shitty of a relationship I was in.  I did return home from my business trip, and after another physical incident, I said that was enough.  I called my parents (who are awesome), and my dad (who is awesome) came and helped me to safely get out.  We were even able to get my car out (its in only my name, and the lease is held by a major bank).  Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now.  In hindsight I should have gotten out *way* sooner, but hindsight is a bitch.

During this process, the tribal courts and tribal police were way more helpful than I had expected.  A distant cousin of my spouse in the court actually helped us by writing a letter which would have compelled access to my car (and how to work the system), even though civil matters weren't his area and the obvious relationship.  (We didn't end up officially using the letter since we couldn't get is signed by a judge in time). The police were very understanding, and felt my request was extremely reasonable, and they did everything they could do to make sure the retrieval went smoothly.

So after an over-night stay in a major PNW city, getting the car to a transport service, and a cross-country flight, I am safely with my parents now.  It's not the house I grew up in, but it still feels like home.  And by the way, my boss and his boss are fantastic.  They have been nothing but understandable and willing to work with me so far, and that is absolutely fantastic.

So now I begin the process of rebuilding.  I'm going to focus on me, and do things I want to do which I know I wil enjoy.  I *will* rebuild myself financially and emotionally (my spouse subtly and not so subtly siphoned off resources by not having much free cash of his own, since he kept buying shit), and I will rebuild relationships which have frayed either due to alienation or distance.  Friends I have already talked to have been nothing but supportive, and I have warned them my spouse might try to manipulate them to get to me.

What about my spouse you may be wondering?  Well, as soon as he realized that I had left his parents' house, turned off a family locator app, and was not answering his calls, he tried to guilt his way back to me.  He supposedly had a nervous breakdown, and was admitted to a local hospital off reservation.  When I landed last night there were messages from him that he had moved to the psych ward at a larger regional hospital, that he was going to try and get money back to me that I had given him for closing costs on the home purchase, and that he was sorry.  While if that is really the case, I'm sorry it happened that way, but I have the closure I need, and from now on I need to focus on myself.

**TL;DR**: I got out of my (financially, emotionally, physically) abusive relationship Monday, and I am not looking back, since I have amazing people in my life and things can only get better from here."

"UPDATE My [27M] little sister [16F] has many pets which she cares for AMAZINGLY! I want to offer her financial assistance- but worry that the offer could be rude


  First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qj2ho/my_27m_little_sister_16f_has_many_pets_which_she/

I want to start this off with the actual update!

My wife and I went over and offered her $500 a month plus $250 in savings. She asked for it to all be savings, which she could touch if something really bad happened, or she had a large expense. I thought this was fair, and agreed to it. Sadly yesterday her Instagram got hacked and deleted which means she has lost all her sponsorships which paid for a lot of her food and supplies... so that's kind of rough. We are thinking of making a fundraiser for her to hold an adoption event but it's tough because privacy is big for our family. We don't want whoever hacked her and sent nasty messages to know her full name and story- but a youcaring is in the works at one point..

Now to adress some common questions and concerns...

**Will she just keep accumulating animals forever?**

* NO! She rehomes almost all animals within six months. We have driven hours before to drop off animals  she only keeps special needs animals, mice, cats, certain animals  and dogs. We are also hoping to host an adoption event or SOMETHING like that soon... because yes she has many animals right now.

**I don't think your financial gift should have the obligation of taking one day off...**

* I phrased that wrong. My plan is for us to come over every weekend and stay over and take over SOME of the care for her animals. She has a binder on the care of each animal in case something were to happen to her so it's pretty simple.

**how many/what kind of animals does she have?**

She texted me a list today...

She has 

* 3 cats

* 2 dogs

* 23 mice (they just had babies)

* 5 rats

* 3 chinchillas

* 1 African grey

* 2 ball pythons

* 1 sun conure

* 2 lesser hedgehog tenrecs

* 1 hedgehog

* 2 hamsters

* 4 quinea pigs

* 2 Juliana pigs 

* 1 potbelly pig

* 3 Pygmy goats 

* 2 sugar gliders

* 3 ferrets

And a couple more LOL I just don't want the post to get too long 

So yeah I don't want the post to get too long but I'm happy to answer any more questions y'all have! I'll be checking this post often today :)

"[UPDATE] My sister[17f] and I [17m] finally found out the real reason our parents got divorced. How can we deal with the feelings of hatred we have toward our mother?


Original topic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6nyg52/my_sister_17f_and_i_17m_finally_found_out_the/)

We posted here a week or so ago about the problems we were having with our parents, and things kinda have been resolved some since then, so I thought I'd update. The same day that we posted the topic we went over to our dad's house. After a lot of stalling and such we never did end up asking him about it on that day since he was extremely happy and we didn't want to ruin that. So we waited, and when we saw him again on Thursday, my sister just let it all out then.

He didn't automatically say anything at first, then he asked us how we felt. My sister told him how she was feeling, and I did as well, and then he just got up and went to make a call after that. He didn't mention anything else about it until later on that day when he took us home, and that's when our mother came out. Usually she just stays inside and we let ourselves in, and I'm pretty sure this is the first time in years they've been close to each other.

We could instantly feel the tension between them, but despite this dad still kept a cool head. All he said was, ""I would appreciate it if you wouldn't discuss those things in that way in front of our children"". There was a little back and forth between them, basically with our mother telling him to screw off, she can talk about what she wants and whatever. Then our dad left, and when we went inside all hell broke lose.

She went off on my sis for being ""nosy"" and ""intruding"" on her adult conversation, and told her to keep her mouth shut about anything she says about dad because then he'll start telling us things that aren't true. My sis was not having it that night and they yelled at each other for at least an hour. It got so bad I had to literally drag her away into her room, but unfortunately our mom followed us in there. Then that's when she said something that I think pretty much gave us our answer, ""...and so what if I wanted to keep my needs met, you'd turn out to do the same slutty thing if you aren't satisfied, so f**k off"". She rambled for a minute about human needs and sexuality and then slammed the door.

The next morning she tried to act like nothing had happened and tried to talk, but neither of us really responded. Later on that day we had to sneak over to dads as she forbid us to go. We asked him a straightfoward question which we said he didn't have to tell us if he thought it wasn't our business.

* How did you find out mom was cheating?
**Answer**: She had brought someone home apparently on the day that my sister and I were at school, and he could literally hear them having sex in the house. Afterwards she just came in his room and flat out told him she wanted a divorce, that she couldn't do this sick thing anymore. And the thing that really struck both me and my sister is that apparently after he was better and back to normal, she asked him to get back together, and he said no. I guess that may be a reason as to why she still has something against him. 

We've discovered so much and its still a lot to take in. My sister is more on the emotional side so it effects her a little more, but just like a lot of other things I know that we'll get over the hurt we feel over this eventually-however long that'll be. For our dad mostly, but also because our mother has done so much emotional damage throughout our lives (not counting this, but it does take the cake for our decision), that we're trying to decide if we even want to continue talking to her when we are older. Right now we've been staying with our dad, and we'll probably be here for awhile. 

To end this on maybe a little happier note our father did tell us that he has been with a women for a little over a year now, and he's thinking about introducing us soon. 
Thank you everyone for your advice in our previous post.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We finally told our father what we heard, and he confronted our mother about it. Mom went off on sis for ""running her mouth"" and they got into an argument, where she basically confessed. We then went to see our father again and he finally told us what happened. We now have some closure, but we're still dealing with the emotional aspects of things. We'll probably be staying with our dad for a little while."

My husband and I moved to Melbourne from Queensland for a job opportunity for me. He was very supportive of the whole thing and quit his job to move. He works in Business and actually got a high managerial role in a pretty big company when we moved here. They liked what he brought to the table. It really worked out for us both, and we've started planning for kids. That is the TLDR version of the past year for us. 

Last week my husbands car was hit by a Hoon when we were sleeping. I don't know if Hoon is a universal term, but in Australia it basically is a fucking idiot who will speed, race, drink drive, do burnouts normally in the dead of night. We have a one garage that I park in because my husband said he's fine with it. He parks on the street corner like is the norm here. A lot of people do it. His car was completely fucked in the front side of the car where the engine is. It's going to be a while before he get's it back. 

My husband needs to get the train at around 6:45 every morning because he needs to be at work at 8:00. He's in a high managerial role which causes him to have to work early, late and even at home to prepare the people under him. It's the middle of winter and the mornings are freezing. It's 1-4°C in the morning here when he leaves. I told him I would give him a ride to the train station until his car is fixed. 

How that you have my side of the story. 

My parents have come out to visit and they're being obnoxious. Every time I come home they open their mouths about how it's wrong of a man to get a ride from his wife. They're telling me how this is wrong to do this when I'm trying to get pregnant. They told me it's the mans job to do this for his wife and not the other way around. I'm losing sleep because I need to wake up at 6 and not 7 to take him to the station. We disrupt their sleeping patterns. My dad just today has started to tell me he's going to tell Muscles (Husband) that he need's to learn how to handle the cold. My husband is not home yet and I'm wondering if it's wrong of me to ask my parents to leave? I spoke to my sister and she told me to send them back to Queensland.

Hey everyone. About a month ago, my husband left me for a girl he met in a bar. It was totally unexpected and my whole world seems like it's been flipped upside down. 
Since then, he's asked for a divorce, completely changed himself, and he's been really ugly to me about everything from child support to custody. He's acting really cocky and he's been basically threatening to take me to court to take our son away from me anytime I disagree wth him about something. He's also refusing to pay 20% of his income in child support because he feels that I don't need it. 
I'm paying my half of this month's rent and moving out and removing my name from the lease and he's moving his new girlfriend in with him. 
I'm having such a hard time with this. I don't want him back or anything like that, but I'm so hurt. I have so much hate and ugly feelings towards him and the new girl. I hate having these feelings and I feel like it's making it harder for me to move on. I want to not feel anything towards him or her but I know I can't just turn my emotions off. 
How can I begin the process of moving on? And how can I overcome these feeling I have towards him and her?

"Me [47 F] with my husband [53 M] 19 years, disagreement about his sister staying in our hotel room with us on vacation.


My husband and I have been married 19 years. We recently went on a trip to Disneyland and his sister invited herself to stay with us in our hotel room. The room was expensive and with her there there wasn't any privacy or romance. I don't like his sister but I was a good sport about it.

Since that trip, when she found out about a vacation we were planning to Italy she again invited herself, took over the itinerary even determining which cities to visit and not visit and sent a list of hotels and noted we could share a room again to save on expenses. (even though she did not pay for the room at Disneyland at all). 


 So I told them both I couldn't go and suggested they go together because I know I will be unhappy sharing a single hotel room with them and not getting to go to the places in Italy I want to go to.  

Now it turns out she is going to Italy with a friend but my husband feels we can't go ourselves without inviting her to join us so as to do so would hurt her feelings. Note: She did not inform me during the planning of her upcoming trip to Italy. She may have told my husband - IDK.


I think it is weird for my sister in law to insist on sharing our hotel rooms with us and also to invite herself on our trips. My husband disagrees. I feel like my feelings are being ignored by both of them and I'm now questioning my own sanity. Do lots of married couples share a hotel room with their SIL? Also, how might I get my husband to understand my pov on this so we can take a vacation without her?

"I [35 M] really want to ask out my best friend [28 M] on a date. I've never been with another man before. Worried about ruining friendship.


So for context we met years ago at a gym. He was about 20 and I was 27. He was already a member when I started going. He talked to me my first day there and showed me the ropes (I'd never been to a gym before). He was super friendly and really helped me feel comfortable with the place. We started working out together a couple times a week, then one day after a workout he asked if I'd be interested in going on a date with him. I just kind of laughed it off and told him I wasn't gay. I told him we could definitely hang out though and he's more than welcome to buy me dinner whenever he wants. The rest is history. We did hang out and had an awesome time, we've been buds ever since.

Well over the last few years I believe my feelings for him have evolved... as dumb as that sounds. I just can't seem to get him out of my head lately. We've started talking more. Every day. It used to be once or twice a week. Now I text him good morning and he always texts me goodnight. We text when we can throughout the day.

I've been seeing more of him. I crave his company. When we are sitting watching movies or a game, I want to touch him. I want to hold his hand. I want to run my hand up his thigh. Jesus fuck... I can't even begin to explain the desire I have for him. It's overwhelming.

He's beautiful. I've always been aware he's a handsome dude but now it's different. So much different.

I constantly want to ask if I can take him out sometime, do that date I said no to all those years ago. However, I doubt I'm even on his radar anymore. I'm also really worried that if ask him and he says no its going to ruin what we have going, and I really wouldn't want to lose him as a friend. He's a great guy. I'd feel a little lost without him. 

Is this worth pursuing? Should I forget about asking him on a date? Am I going completely insane? Sometimes it feels like it.

"My [35F] girlfriend is ignoring me [28M] after meeting her autistic child for the first time.



Just wanted to say that I hope this doesn't offend anyone and I'm sorry if anything said is taken rudely. I can expand on anything wrote in the comments if needed. 

My girlfriend ""Julie"" and I have been together for just over a year. We are both divorced, so we've taken things slowly, and it's worked well for us. She's wonderful, and we share similar interests, values, goals, and communication styles. 

Julie is a mother to a twelve year old low-functioning autistic child (I'm not sure if that's PC, but those are her words). It's something we've discussed, and she's shared her frustrations on occasion. She expressed early into our relationship that I wouldn't meet her child until she felt confident in our relationship being long-term. Most of our time spent together was during her child's school day, late nights, or weekends when they're with their father, so there was never even a brief introduction. 

Shortly after our first anniversary, Julie decided she was ready for her child and I to meet. Like mentioned, her son is low-functioning on the spectrum. He's nonverbal, and has a lot of behaviors I've never experienced. He spent most of our time together pacing back and forth or sitting next to Julie rocking himself. He doesn't speak, but he grunts and screams. He'd be okay and the next moment he'd be screaming and scratching or squeezing at his arms or at Julie's arms. There were a few instances where he showed aggression towards me to but Julie controlled the situation. Our visit went on like this for about an hour, but Julie was frustrated and told me they were both overwhelmed and that she'd call me later. 

She texted me that night extremely upset. She apologized, and told me this is why she doesn't date and how she'll be single until death because who could love and accept her and her child. We texted a bit and I reassured her that I loved her, but needed to head to bed and that I'd talk to her tomorrow. 

I haven't heard back from her since that night. I've made several attempts to contact her and they've all been ignored. I'm upset, but there's a small sense of relief. I don't know if this is how I want to experience parenthood for the first time. Her son's needs are a huge responsibility, and I was overwhelmed after just an hour with him. However, I love Julie tremendously, and I she's someone I can see myself growing and sharing a long-term relationship with. I just don't really know what to do now.  

TL;DR My girlfriend is a parent to an autistic child. We met for the first time after a year, and now she isn't talking to me. I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to a life of parenting an autistic child.

Edit: I didn't want to use identifying details at first but realized I made the switch from ""they"" to ""he"" eventually. Sorry. 

Edit: Also wanted to add that yes, I knew she had a child with autism. I never grasped the severity of her situation even though we'd discussed it in detail several times. It wasn't something that hit me until I was experiencing it. My only interaction with an autistic person has been a family member who was just very particular about things and had his quirks (for lack of better term). He was verbal and fairy independent."

My mother-in-law is kind, sweet, and generous, but I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by how much time I am spending with her. I work 32 hours per week, and she watches my daughter until 3:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays and until 5:30 p.m. on Wednesdays. We also get together with my in-laws on Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoon-evenings.


When I come home from work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I want to have one on one time with my daughter. But my mother-in-law lingers for an hour or two after I've come home. She also decides that ""we're going to the park"" or ""we're going to the library,"" and then I tag along, even though I might just like to spend some time at home with my daughter after I've been at work. 
  

The last thing I want to do is hurt her feelings, but I feel like we spend plenty of time together as a family. How do I tactfully explain that I just want to her to leave when I get home from work? I don't think my husband should be the one to tell her this (she's gone by the time he gets home from work). I think it should come straight from me.


EDIT ----------------


Thank you so much for all of your thoughts, comments, and suggestions. We had a nanny until the nanny had to move a few months ago. We decided to put our child in a childcare center that we love. My mother-in-law said she didn't want our daughter spending Monday through Friday in  daycare from 8:30a-3:30p, so we agreed that our daughter could stay home with her on Tuesday/Thursdays. For us, the cost is not an issue. If anything, my mother-in-law wants to watch our daughter every day.

She lives with my father-in-law, who also is sometimes at our house when I get home. Also, our time together on Tuesday/Thursday afternoons isn't adult socializing, it's just playtime. It almost feels like we're competing for my daughter's attention. I think my mother-in-law doesn't realize it -- she's just having more fun with her granddaughter who she loves more than anything. 


But it's hard for me to watch when she (seemingly) distracts my daughter from me with a new activity. Maybe she thinks I want time to relax when I get home from work. But I relax after my daughter goes to bed. I didn't negotiate a reduced work schedule to come home and watch TV while my kid plays with someone else.

(The lingering happened again last night, which is why this sounds more like I'm venting).

"My (28F) husband (31M) struggles to follow even the most basic instructions in the home.


My husband and I have been together for five years, married for one, and I'm currently 23wks pregnant. Recently, his inability to follow even basic directions around the house has been driving me mad. I'm getting to the point where I actually think there might be something diagnosable wrong with him.

I'll preface this by saying I'm not a nag with unreasonable expectations. I only work part time so I am the primary homemaker - cooking, cleaning, washing etc - so I don't expect him to do much. But the few things I do ask of him seem completely beyond his capabilities. It's almost as though he can't cement things in his memory.

A few examples: last year, our dog had to have (very expensive) surgery because she got a bread tie caught in her throat that she must've found on the floor. Last night, I walked into the kitchen after my husband had made a sandwich and the bread was laying on the table open, and the bread tie had fallen to the floor. When I told him to be more careful in future given what had happened to our dog, he just shrugged and said ""sorry, I didn't think"". This morning, after he'd left for work, I came into the kitchen to find he had done the exact same thing post-breakfast.

Our bin collection is every Tuesday morning. His only chores in the house are to sort his clothes so I can wash them, and to take the bins out. For the last three weeks we have missed bin day because he forgot. I even remind him before I go to bed on Monday night to do it, and he says he will, but within the following hour or so before he comes to bed he has already forgotten.

Our cat frequently gets herself stuck on a high shelf in our closet and cries until someone gets her down. Like, constant wailing. I'm short, so it requires me standing on a chair to do it, which is not a good idea in my pregnant state. The simple solution to this is to close the closet door. This is simply beyond my husband's ability to remember. Every single night I'm awoken by the cat's crying because my husband has left the closet open before coming to bed, and because he sleeps like a log I've had to climb up onto the chair every night. I feel that even if I fell off the chair and hurt myself trying to get the cat down he *still* wouldn't remember to close the closet the next night.

I know these aren't big ""issues"" but all the little things - and the futility of trying to get him to take even minor responsibilities seriously - is really wearing me down. How can I trust him not to just ""forget"" important stuff once our baby is born? Will he just leave chokable things around? Forget to make sure chemicals are out of reach? Forget to close the baby gate on the stairs? 

I feel as though his inability to do these things has gone beyond simple laziness. I'm worried he has something like ADHD or an actual diagnosable issue. 

I really don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** : my husband can't remember even the most basic responsibilities around the home."

"[UPDATE] Me [24 M] dating [25 F] for three months; shes moving in with an ex - am I overreacting?


Original post is [here.](https://dg.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qd4p5/me_24_m_dating_25_f_for_three_months_shes_moving/)

First, I want to thank everyone who responded. My main question was truly would this be a deal breaker for others, regardless of anxiety levels.

A lot of people brought up cheating as my main concern. That wasn't it - but again reminds me how a lot of the advice given in this subreddit is black/white and also very focused on infidelity. I'm so sorry many of us have been hurt by previous relationships.

So I sat down with her on Sunday night, both eager to have this conversation. I wrote a note so I wouldn't over talk/explain, which basically thanked her for being so up front with telling me about her living situation and stated that for me, it is a deal breaker that I wouldn't want to continue dating someone who is moving in with an ex in the next month. I let her know that I could see myself falling in love with her (which is v true, if I haven't started yet) as a way of clarifying that that is why this was really hard for me and has been something I've been trying to process/mull over for the past few weeks.


**She understood and then told me that she hadn't even signed a lease on this upcoming place. Turns out, she's just more laid back than I am (I mean heck, we are still trying to fill the 4th room in our apartment) and that she had already had plans to check out other spaces.**

I told her I didn't want her changing her plans over this, but she explained how neutral the situation with her ex was so she hadn't even considered fully how it would feel on the other side, seeing now that yeah - it would be a deal breaker for lots of folks. She respected my feelings and I respected her by letting her know it was something I wouldn't be able to get over and I wouldn't want to make either of us miserable by being uncomfortable with going to her place. Sure, she could come to my place all the time, but I explained how balance is super important to me in relationships. She agreed.

She said the choice she was making was to continue seeing me and learning about us and exploring this. I want that, too. It didn't seem like the end of the world, though she worried about losing me. She didn't lose me, nor I her, because the communication was simple and not full of all the what if's that my brain usually launches my way.

Soooooo we are still dating. She's looking at some places with other friends this week and seemed happy about some of the options, amongst all the other change going on in her life though I imagine it is hard, I will be super supportive and have asked how I can be.

The maturity she showed while handling it and being honest with me makes me like her even more. So hey. Maybe she da one ok. I'll let ya'll know if that ever happens.

**for folks who also have intense anxiety** I haven't had any anxiety about it since Sunday morning (before we talked) when i had written the note, with a line taken kindly from u/tsukiii ""Thank her for being upfront about it, and let her know that you aren't ok with it and that it's best to part ways."" I felt ready and calmer after that. And I haven't had any anxiety since the convo Sunday night :)

"[UPDATE]My[24M] ex[23F] will not send back a very important jacket back to me


Original post:https://redd.it/6qe9cz

It was a small post but I got some good advice on the matter. Well, my grandmother didn't get her jacket in time. She was the little family I had left and I don't know what to do. 

I tried to take y'alls advice and send a UPS employee to pick it up, so I asked my ex for her address, and she said not to worry and she will actually send it this time, and I guess I shouldn't of believed her. I asked her a day after that post, so it's been six days. No jacket, I asked to her text when it was sent, nothing. I don't know whether to even care about it anymore, or just forget about the whole deal in general. I guess I'm just kind of mad at the whole situation. Thanks for listening, and anyone who posted on the original post.

"It's time to pay the electric bill... and I [25/F] receive a text from one of my roommates [24/F] saying she will only contribute $5 this month... Advice needed.


First off: this is my first post, so thank you for reading.


A little background: I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with four roommates. Two females 24 & 25, and two males 23 & 24. A couple splits one of the bedrooms. The couple are both theater people. We've been living here for about a year and a half so far.


Last summer the girlfriend was away two months doing a residency for a theater show. She wasn't around *at all* since she was so far away (understandable) so we had no problem covering her portion of the electric bill since she literally wasn't coming back anytime during the summer.


This summer, though, for the months of July and August she is away again, but nearby for another theater production... but because it is so close in proximity to our apartment, she has been coming over and visiting for about a week at a time since she ""left"". (Her boyfriend lives here. It kinda makes sense.)


So understandably, this makes for a ""grey area"" when it comes to the electric bill for the month. We don't use the AC a lot, mostly since it is a source of tension/aggravation in the household between who uses it and when, but when she is here it goes on more often (even if she is, as she calls herself when visiting, ""a guest"").


I got this text message in our ""roommate group text"" yesterday morning presumably as she was on the train back to NJ, and... I.... honestly I'm speechless.


**TRANSCRIPT OF TEXT BECAUSE I CANNOT ADD LINKS: 
[image: screenshot of electric bill notice from her email inbox - roughly it's about $125.]
TEXT: ""Hi hi ConEd. I added up the days I visited in July - I was there for a total of 4 full days in July, plus 4 sleeps. That's roughly six full days. That's how many days I wasn't there in JUNE, so I won't be paying much toward the bill for July since it evens out - if that seems fair. Let me know if you want to talk about it, I'm open! In the mean time, total would be $40 each. I'm picking up like $5 of it."" ***


I'm sorry... what? WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS???


Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if all four of us went on a month-long vacation, the electric bill would still be roughly the same price. It doesn't fluctuate more or less that much if one less person is in the apartment.


I thought covering her portion of the electric made sense when she was too far away to visit, but now that she IS and is sending texts like this, shouldn't she contribute a little more than $5?


This entire thing just came off wrong, and it may be petty but I want to call her out on avoiding a normal face-to-face conversation as well... maybe because she knows how insane this sounds?


I can't talk about this with my other roommates for now unless i have a good grasp on what I want to say, since one of them is her boyfriend and sides with her on everything, and the other roommate is best friends with the boyfriend. I'm kinda outnumbered 3-to-1 in every situation.

While I don't want to pay more than I should, especially when I am not home often and the others use the AC (whenever I'm home I refuse to turn it on), I don't know if it's worth arguing this for a few dollars' difference. However, I do want her to be aware that I see what she's doing, and I'd rather she didn't try to play such complicated games and send inane texts like that in the future.

And also, for those that inevitably will say ""maybe get new roommates"": the lease is up in February. I have a few more months, moving is a complicated/difficult process and I don't want to start that any earlier than I absolutely need to.


Any advice or opinions on how to proceed forward, fellow Redditors, would be great.



tl;dr: One of three roommates that is supposed to be ""away"" is trying to split the electric bill despite her frequent visits. (Please see text transcript above). Advice and opinions are desperately needed to make sure that 1) i am not overreacting and that this is pretty crazy, and 2) i can proceed forward in a manner that ensures i don't get ripped off, can call out this behavior, and not completely ruin the last few months i have left.



***EDIT/UPDATE***: Solved! Thanks to all of you lovely people I was able to put together a coherent, respectful response in which I explained how monthly bills work. All of us travel and don't receive discounts for it, so this should be no different especially with her frequent visits. I told her I would pay the amount she asked this month, but going forward, would only be paying my portion going forward. 

She said she agreed & would pay her equal share, venmo'd back the difference she owed, and mentioned in the same breath that she's coming back to visit for another few days this weekend. So. That's as good as it's gonna get, folks. I'll take it. "
"My father's (M65) partner (F55) wants a relationship but I (F29) do not.


I'll try to provide a bit of background on us as people before I jump in.

**Me:** Shy, introverted, socially awkward, solitary.

**Dad's partner of 8 years:** We'll call her Sarah. She's very opinionated, strong-headed, extroverted and very family-oriented.

**My dad:** a quiet, socially-awkward introvert like me.

My mom and dad got divorced about 9 years ago and my dad started dating Sarah shortly after. I was 20 and living at home at the time attending university. When they first got divorced, my dad lived with me in our family home and he was incredibly depressed. He would drink and watch porn all night and stay in his room. I barely saw him. I didn't really know how to react as a young adult, I did my best to ask him if he was okay, talk to him and made food and all that. When he got with Sarah, he slowly got out of his funk.

When I first met Sarah, I thought she was perfectly fine and did my best to be polite. She was a stranger dating my dad, I didn't dislike her or anything, she was just a new random person who hung around the house sometimes now. 

Without really coming out and telling me directly - I heard through my dad - that she was disappointed that I didn't form a relationship with her. I thought it was kind of odd, was I supposed to be BFFs with this lady? And it's hard for me to be open with my friends, let alone older women who I don't know.

She has a bunch of kids my age or older who live in different cities and she keeps in touch with them and visits them frequently.

Anyway... this was 8 years ago, I don't remember the details, but Sarah had a blowout. It started when my car broke down and I had to get to work, so I asked Sarah if I could borrow her car. She let me, I thanked her, and went to work and came back. No biggie.

Well, apparently she thought that I DID NOT thank her (I'm 99% sure I did...) and that led to the blowout. She wrote me a big long Facebook message accusing me of being abusive to my father (what?!!), a bad person and slew of other things. 

I responded, refuting her claims. I don't remember the exact things either of us said, but I disagreed with her and told her my feelings too. Then she promptly blocked me on Facebook.

I remained blocked from her Facebook until about a year ago. 

Since the blowout, I've been cordial with her and not really acknowledged the elephant in the room, for my dad's sake. For the most part, I've honestly just been pretending she doesn't exist when I don't absolutely have to see her. I don't want her in my life, and she's definitely given me the impression she doesn't want me in hers.

There have been a few times over the years where she and my dad have invited me and my fiance over for dinner, and we've gone most of the time. Sometimes we couldn't make it for various reasons. It was always awkward and I'd need to drag my fiance along because he obviously isn't a fan of how she's treated me either.

When we do have dinner with them, Sarah and I just pretend that everything is cool. I am polite. Socially awkward, sure, but polite. I thank her for the meal and try to talk with her and my dad.

Another thing to mention... she has snubbed me several times in public.

I went to my cousin's art show opening and Sarah was there without my dad. I literally walked up to her and said ""Hi Sarah!"" and she turned and walked the other way.

More recently, I went out for a pancake breakfast with a bunch of friends for my birthday. My dad and Sarah were there. So I walked over to say hello, I specifically said ""Hi Sarah!"" about 5 feet away from her, and she didn't acknowledge me at all - just stared down at her food.

So... this is how things have been for the past 8 years. When I see her in public, I expect her to snub me. They invite us over once and a while for dinner, sometimes we'll go and do our best to have a pleasant time. My dad comes over to visit me at my house at least a couple times a month and we try to go out for lunch or go see movies with each other regularly. I haven't invited Sarah over to my house once.

So that brings us to present day.

Just a couple days ago I went over to my dad's to fix his Netflix and drop off his wedding invitation. I hemmed and hawwed over inviting Sarah to the wedding and figured in the end that I should, for my dad's sake. So her name was on the invite.

So I went inside, handed over the invite, said hi to my dad and Sarah and did my tech troubleshooting.

I was getting ready to leave when she pulled me aside and told me we had to talk. Great...

It was an hour long ""talk"" (tyrade might be a better word?) and I left in tears.

It was basically a personal attack on my character shrouded under the guise of ""wanting to build a relationship with me"". She told me I was rude, uncaring and disrespectful. She said how hurt her and my father were when we didn't come to their dinners. She told me how hurt she was when I don't ask about her and her life. She kept bringing up the fact that her son's wife has cancer and how uncaring it was of me not to ask her about it (what?). 

She told me I was raised poorly. My dad, all the while, was sitting there silently (as he usually does) and agreeing with her. I couldn't believe it. My parents were fine parents! Yeah, I was kind of a spoiled only-child but I turned out fine. I have a loving fiance, a great group of friends, awesome job, a dog, a house... not to mention my fiance's family - all of them love me!

I've literally never had anyone else say anything like this to me. My fiance's family knows I'm shy, but they think I'm a very sweet person nonetheless.

After the attack, she switched gears and started going on about how she really wanted us to get to know each other and build a relationship. She didn't want to just go to my wedding for the sake of my dad, she wanted to be there because she's excited for me. She said she wants to go dress shopping with me.

The whole thing... was mind-boggling. I just sat there, nodding through my tears, unable to even process what the fuck she was saying. I agreed to work on our relationship, we hugged, I left.

It's now been a few days since that happened and well... the more I think about it, the angrier I feel. I don't WANT a relationship with her. I don't like her. She's been nothing but a bully to me. When I came home crying, my fiance was seething with anger. He wanted to go over there to talk to her but I stopped him. 

I really love my dad, and I know he really badly wants us to be friends but... fuck, she is making it hard.

She keeps telling me what a ""warm"" and ""caring"" person she is, but she certainly hasn't shown me. 

I'd be happy if I never had to see her again, honestly. But my dad... ugh. I don't want to lose him in the process.

What do I do? 

**TLDR:** Dad's ""loving and caring"" partner is trying to build a relationship with me by attacking my shy personality and snubbing me."

"My [26F] husband [26M] of three years wants me to have a surgery I'm not totally sure about having


January of this year, I found out that I was a carrier of the BRAC1 gene. This did not surprise me as a vast majority of women on my father's side have gotten breast cancer. I have a history of cancer on both sides of my family, and it's been a mix of genetics and lifestyle choices. Seeing people very close to me die or fight a very difficult battle has encouraged me to try and stay as healthy as I can, and take any precautions to avoid getting cancer. I was told that I could have a preventative bilateral mastectomy and it sounded like a good idea.

I spoke to my husband about it and he told me that he wanted me to do anything I could do to protect myself, he would love and support me through it. So I had the procedure done. I noticed that I was surprisingly apathetic to losing my breasts, often being unable to relate to other women who felt ""maimed"" or like they were less of a woman. It felt weird not having my breasts there anymore but I wasn't particularly happy or sad.

I recently spoke to my doctor and she mentioned that I could get breast reconstruction, if I would like one. I was, again, pretty apathetic and said I might consider it. I passed along the idea to my husband in a conversation, not really going too much into it. He asked me if I was thinking of getting the reconstruction, I told him that I didn't put much thought into it. We started talking about something else then.

About a week ago, my husband abruptly told me that he would prefer if I got the surgery but understands if I don't want to. I asked him why; he said in bed and in terms of intimacy, he really misses them. He also said that it's taken a while to get used to my new body. This surprised me as he never even hinted at this before and actually seemed very accepting and loving of my body without my breasts.

I didn't know how to process this information at first. Now that I know what I do, I have been seriously contemplating getting the procedure done. I don't really know if I personally want to. I honestly think I could live without breasts. However, my husband has been very supportive of me. Not only in this journey, but also with my getting a PhD and pursuing my career. I'm wondering if I should take one for the team and the sake of my marriage. Admittedly, the surgery would make my now flat torso proportional to the rest of my curvy body which my husband would probably enjoy as well. I appreciate him staying, still being intimate me, and still trying to make me feel beautiful and desirable even if I had a body he seemed to have found less attractive.

I didn't think that this time a week ago I'd be thinking so much about this, but for the happiness of my spouse, would it be worth it? I'm trying to think objectively without my own personal biases.

I know this probably sounds petty, and a person has a right to their own opinion, and a person isn't defined by one belief but.. It's not like she's my lifelong best friend. Our relationship is completely over facebook. She is VERY religious. I'm bisexual, and she told me that she was SO relieved when I started dating a man. Just a few days ago, we were talking about the wedding and again she brought up that she's happy I'm with a man and said out of the blue that she would never go to my wedding otherwise, as it would be a ""celebration of sin"". 

I feel like I'm making a big deal about it because I'm getting mad about something that isn't even happening, but it honestly hurt my feelings that she wouldn't want to celebrate love with me in certain circumstances.

"Me [26 F] infatuated with my 7 year old son's best friend's dad [39 M]


My son became best friends with his 1st grade classmate last year. Towards the end of the school year, I exchanged numbers during school pick up with his friend's dad so they could play over the summer. 

I always found him incredibly attractive, but never gave much thought because I was going through a divorce and under stress. The kids have played all summer long together. 

I have developed a huge crush on the dad. I get excited to see him at kid exchanges and even fantasize about us. However, our conversations are usually short and to the point, mostly about the kids. About a couple weeks ago, the dad texted me that he was sorry he is so awkward, and that he gets nervous and freezes around pretty girls. I told him I understand, and that I know the feeling. Though I wish I expressed at this time that I feel the same way with him. 

Ever since he texted me this, he hasn't come to the door. My son will just come straight out when I pull up to his house. I almost feel like he is avoiding me or something. His texts are also short. 

How do I get him to ask me out? How do I express my interest? I don't want to make things weird between us because our kids are so close-so I don't want to ruin that. I feel like he will never ask me out though. It has been months.

"I think my 31/F fiancee is cheating on me 32/M.


I strongly suspect now and i'm horrified of the implications. We're getting married in September, I have a daughter with her. I don't know what I'll do without her.

I've been dating her since my final year of college. We have a child together a few years back and moved in together. I wanted to marry her when the time was right. 

I started suspecting she was cheating when left her phone with me on accident. I was prepping to bring it back to her when I saw a text from a guy named ""Rob"". I thought it was strange as I know all her friends and I know of nobody named Rob.  I didn't snoop. A couple hours later she gets a call from Rob. Twice he calls. I shrug this off and don't press the issue. I don't snoop.

Well, last friday I was home with my daughter. I was off for the day and going to surprise her at work with lunch. I head towards her work place and find out she never showed up. Panic begins to set in and i call her phone. No answer. I start thinking the worst has happened. I stop off at the store to get some fresh diapers and across the street who do i see?

Alarms went off; 1. She's supposed to be at work. 2. Who the hell is this dude she's dressed up for and looks like she's on a date? 3. Why is she with him at our favorite restaurant to go on dates? The same place I proposed to her.

I'm in my car and can see her laughing and chatting. I want to do a test. I call her cell and she picks up and rushes towards a better location. She picks up the phone and seems agitated. She doesn't seem to want to chat and says she's really busy and can't talk. I tell her I made her lunch but, she says she already is going to get something at work and she's really busy and will be out late. She heads back. I leave feeling rejected.

I didn't confront her that night. I couldn't bare too do so. But, I know somethings going on now my friend said she saw her with another guy holding hands. She asked me about that. Also I've noticed how she doesn't get into our RPs anymore or want to have sex. She always has an excuse. She's been cold to me lately.But then when I mention the wedding she gets happy and excited. I can't figure out why she's having such bizarre mood swings.

Why? Why would she do so? Our sex life could be better sure but, I got a new promotion and a nice pay raise with it. We have a family now. We're talking about moving into a home and maybe even having another child. Her career is growing too. Life is excellent for us. Why? Why would she do this to me? What reason could she have?

"My GF [22] is obsessed with social media, I [29M] don't use social media and she has a problem with that.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 months. She is constantly using social media around me- Snapchat, Instagram etc (she has 13k followers etc). This doesn't bother me at all, it is just how things are now. I on the other hand deleted all my social media in early 2016 and have no ambitions to ever be involved with social media again.

She constantly asks me to reactivate my Instagram, which I always shoot down. Finally I asked her why it's so important and she said that it is so odd that someone my age doesn't use social media, and that it makes her think I'm ""talking to other girls or hiding something.""

I laughed at this but she insists it is extremely odd that I don't use social media and that she feels like she can't trust me.

This seems totally ridiculous to me. Does she have a leg to stand on here?

TL;DR- GF thinks it's weird I have no social media, says I'm hiding something, pressures me to activate IG."
"I [24f] had three nice conversations with my boyfriend's [24m] dad [50s] and now my boyfriend is really struggling to manage his jealousy. What do?


Edit: So I'm going to come across as dismissive and callous at some points. But I'm leaving the post as is. My apologies, my boyfriend agreed to having me write this post and compile answers but wanted it told pretty strictly from my perspective of what was happening at the time with perhaps some commentary on how I felt or thought he was feeling not making it in either.  I'm not in the habit of talking about my private life with strangers on reddit and am just generally awkward anyway, I'm coming from a good place and just want to know what I'm supposed to do to help my boyfriend. I know not to say things so blunt as I've put them here when I'm offering my support and would like to assure everyone that my boyfriend shares a similiar crude style of posting, a lot of the words I use are the words he introduced, and quite a few things are paraphrased from him as well, etc. Also probably relevant is that I grew up without a dad and did not have a good impression of them overall either, sorry if I seem chip on the shoulder or something. 



My boyfriend and I have been dating a little over a year and took a little vacation to visit his parents, my first time meeting them. Due to some circumstances, I ended up meeting his father alone, after he came home from work.  

We had a very pleasant conversation and discovered a few mutual interests. We ended up spending some time in his study going over his materials and a few of his collections. When I walked out of the study my boyfriend had arrived at some point and was sitting at the foot of the staircase. I immediately knew something was up from the look on his face but we didn't discuss it until later that night. His father's demeanor changed completely. He greeted my boyfriend verbally and then barely spoke or made eye contact with anyone for the rest of the night.    


The second we were alone it was a full on interrogation about what his father and I had spoken about. He was unusually flustered and seemingly irate I couldn't produce a court transcript level recollection of what I'd thought was just interesting small talk. He kept repeating that he'd heard his father laugh.  


It was very overwhelming but I finally got him to explain that his father does not talk to him, has never let him in his study, and my boyfriend isn't sure he's heard his father laugh before. The behavior I'd witnessed all night from his father was the norm, his manner in the study was aberrant.  

 
My boyfriend tried talking to his father, both alone and with me, about topics I remembered his father and I discussing and was barely acknowledged. His father was quiet whenever anyone else was around for the rest of our trip, only answering direct questions with mutters or sighs typically. We had two more pleasant conversations in which he was polite and jovial. It was very odd, he'd go from sipping his coffee and asking me questions to flipping open his newspaper and ignoring me the second someone came into the kitchen.  

My boyfriend and his siblings have brought people home before, without this effect. My boyfriend seems consumed with figuring out what triggered it and how to replicate it but I do not have any answers with him. Nothing about our conversation, that I remember or noticed, was remarkable in any way. I didn't even get the impression the man particularly liked me, I thought he was just being polite. I can tell by the look on my boyfriend's face when he's obsessing now. We keep having the same conversations, over and over. I have no idea what he gets out of it at this point, neither does he.  


**tl;dr:** Boyfriend's distant father was friendly towards me, boyfriend can't stop obsessing over how jealous this made him feel, what's the best thing to do?"

"[Update] My (27F) mother (57F) is cutting me off from her side of the family over a tattoo


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mxqw4/my_27f_mother_57f_is_cutting_me_off_from_her_side/)
  

So it's been a month since this happened. Since then, I haven't been in contact with my mother much. I've had the whole ""my decisions aren't done to intentionally disrespect/hurt you"" etc etc after I got my first tattoo over a year and a half ago. Nothing helped but time, so my strategy this time was to just wait it out. 

I've called her three times this past month (just checking in on things) and each time she'll answer the phone with ""Oh, it's you. I don't want to talk to you"" or something like ""If you're trying to reach your father, call his cell"" instead of like....handing him the house phone (no cell service in the house). I just respond with ""Oh well, I just wanted to let you know about XYZ but just call me back if you're ever ready to talk"" and I get nothing. 

Meanwhile, I'm still trying to plan this trip. Most hotels are mostly booked and everything is running smoothly. I reach out to my aunt (mom's sister in Japan) through a messaging app we all use just saying ""Hey! As you know, my Japan trip is coming up soon. I'll be in your city these days, do you have any hotel recommendations for the area? I'm looking forward to seeing everyone and just let me know if you'd like to meet up on a certain day. Thanks etc etc"". I really tried not to be imposing and just opening the lines of communication with a simple hotel recommendation. She already knows about my trip (any my tattoos), since I hosted her daughter (my cousin) during her America trip back in March.

This was three days ago. I know my aunt is very active on social media, but I haven't gotten a response. Yesterday, both my sister and my father call me (pretty unusual) about my mom. They're concerned she's having some sort of mental breakdown or something and that I'm ruining our relationship by ""ignoring"" her and that this cold shoulder treatment isn't helping anybody (WHAT?!). My father in particular mentioned she has been much more upset about the issue in the last couple days, which would coincide with when I reached out to my Aunt. 

My sister mentioned that my mom was really upset when they spoke a few weeks ago, but it hasn't been brought up since. My sister said she convinced my mom that cutting ties between her family and I was a terrible decision.....but I am concerned my mother did so anyways after she found out I talked to my aunt. 

My father urged me to call my mom and ask how she's doing. He advised me to not take things so personally and not ""take the bait"". My sister also asked if I would be willing to sit down with her and my mom and talk about things, or even seek family counseling. 

My biggest issue is that: I don't have a problem with my mom personally. My biggest issue is that when she gets upset about something, she gets really really abusive. Not just about the tattoo, about my job/boyfriend/career/moving to a different city. She threatens cutting ties and threatens pretty much everything under the sun she has control over (which isn't much anymore compared to when I was a teenager). Before the tattoo, she'll remark how I can't see her family because I'm too fat, or too disrespectful, or that my Japanese isn't good enough, or that my boyfriend is too American. I am just so sick of it. I am not willing to put myself out there again. From my point of view, I am the only one that loses or risks anything by reaching out. I am expected to extend this olive branch time and time again meanwhile, she takes everything out on me.

My only sister has had a completely different relationship with my parents. She has never had this kind of treatment since she was a young teenager. Neither of us have any idea why my mom is so quick to be angry at me and hurl these abuses. It's really an entirely different side to her. I cannot just ""brush it off"" or ignore it. It gets to me. I try to forget everything she's said but bottom line is, it keeps me up. It fuels my anxiety and it reinforces all my doubt and anger and depression. I am distancing myself more out of self preservation than anything else. If I can just ignore everything until she forgets in a few more months, or I can put myself through hell for the slim chance that it'll make a difference. 

I just don't know what to do. I have other shit in my life to deal with and NOT dealing with her tantrums is honestly a huge relief to me in this past month. She knows, my family knows if she ever 1) picks up the phone and 2) isn't a huge bitch, then I am more than willing to talk to her. I feel like all this aggression and negativity is from her end but my immediate family is making it my responsibility. 

I don't know why my mom says the things she does. I am not her therapist and I'm not equipped to become her therapist. My family doesn't know 1/10 of the things she's done or said to me. If I do sit down with them I have no idea what to talk about or how to resolve the issue. I know I'm being selfish and petty by not reaching out to her more.....but on the other hand I've been so hurt over something that isn't my fault. I have been nothing but a good kid my whole life and the discrepancy between how I'm treated vs my sister makes this whole thing a LOT harder to swallow.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My mom is reacting worse than I originally thought and may have already started cutting ties. Do I try to be the bigger person at the expense of my mental well being or do I take the low road and hide until this is all over. "

"[UPDATE] My (17F) boyfriend (16F) of a year kicked me out of anger.


First off: My original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66qbq6/my_17f_boyfriend_16f_of_a_year_kicked_me_out_of/) didn't gain much traction, and I was going to post here for advice on moving on anyway. As the two events are strongly related, I have decided to just include this as an update. Many thanks to everybody who commented on my OP and gave me advice. You were all right, and I was too naive, in love and in denial to see it. Thank you especially to u/roflllobster, who's post assisted me now in working up the courage to end it.

After 3 months of torment, and my confidence and mental health being the slave of my relationship, I have ended it. Do I still love him? Of course. He was my first love and he helped me through a lot of shit (which has unfortunately returned due to his anger issues and general mistreatment of me). I now have therapy, so I'm not dependent on him for the healing of my mental health and I have gained the love and trust of old friends who I neglected for him just a year ago. I have seen the errors in the way he treated me.

When confronted about his disrespect and negative behaviour towards me, it would be my fault, because it isn't his fault that I'm a pussy (yep, he said that to me). He said he feels like he's ""treading on eggshells"" when talking to me. He also said that talking to me is annoying, and that he has more fun without me. Then 30 or so minutes later he would come back apologising and telling me he loves me and that I'm amazing. I've been called a bitch, I've been kicked and grabbed by him. I feel so disrespected, and my therapist said it definitely sounds like I blame myself for his disrespect because he makes me feel as though I'm too sensitive.

Despite realising my self worth, and having all the friends in the world to help me through this, I still crave his affection. He was my best friend, I love him so much. It's been a few hours and I can't process things properly. I need advice on how to make it through the next week without my best friend. I want to hug him, kiss him, I miss him so much. I don't know what to do. We would talk until one of us fell asleep every night, we played games together, and we did everything together.

Please help me reddit. I've never experienced anything like this before. I feel like crying all the time, why am I so upset when I've been treated so badly?

Tl;dr: Left an abusive (??) boyfriend. Struggling to cope being without someone who I considered my best friend. Need advice on how to survive the next week or so without him."
