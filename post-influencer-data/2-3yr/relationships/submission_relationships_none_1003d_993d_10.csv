"[Update] My [66M] wife [61F] is taking care of her aunt [86F] and it is killing our marriage.


Original link: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5fdl1q/my_66m_wife_61f_is_taking_care_of_her_aunt_86f/

Something completely magical happened. My wife and I were looking at a house we both actually love. It has every single thing we waned in our retirement home and it's close to everything that we need. We were thrilled and when she told her aunt and showed her the pictures of the house her aunt laughed and said ""You can't buy that, it has stairs! I can't go up and down the stairs!"" 

Something clicked in my wife's mind. She simply said to her aunt, it's the house that my husband and I like and the fact that it has some stairs that you are healthy enough to go up and down on won't stop us. Her aunt cried and cried. We called our (new) therapist which suggested that we treat her like a child, check on her every 15 minutes but not give in. We did that and she got over it by the next morning. 

My wife also got more ""tough love"" with her aunt and whenever she'll complain about stuff my wife knows are unreal my wife dismisses it politely. 

Things aren't 100% perfect, the new therapist helped my wife a lot, she mainly focused on her and why my wife was feeling the almost nurturing need to be there for her aunt. 

Thank you /r/relationships for the advice, changing therapists was a great idea, I don't know if I have had the courage to just follow through without you but I did the very next day.

"I [24M] was offered a job 3 hours away. My girlfriend [25F] of 3 years would probably have to leave a job she loves if I accept. The new job pays both our current salaries combined, so I could support her, but it's more about her being afraid she won't find a job she loves again.

I know the initial post didn't get very big at all, but I thought maybe if I updated everyone, then someone out there going through a similar thing would be able to get some perspective on their own situation. There was a lot of stuff I didn't mention in that post because I guess I knew everyone would just tell me to break up with him and I wasn't prepared to do that. This took some courage to write and I'm sorry if I come off as spineless in the events of this story. Believe me, I now see how pathetic it was. Even at the time, I kinda knew it.

Anyways, long story short, after months of being in the relationship the problem really wasn't just his new emotionally distant coldness. He was diagnosed bipolar and would sometimes get upset at me over ""my past"" (i.e. sleeping around while single) and make me cry for it. But when I'd threaten to leave, the tender side of him would kick in and he'd promise to change. It sounds so clearly emotionally abusive when I phrase it that simply, but it's such a different experience when you're actually living through it. It's easy to dismiss abusers in movies when they're Nothing But Mean and you're an outsider looking into a brief snippet of a relationship. A lot harder when real people are much more nuanced and memories kick in. Especially when they apologize and tell you that they know their mental illness is hurting you in ways you absolutely don't deserve, but that they truly care about you and are going to get help because they are weak with not much to call their own.

Nonetheless, I found myself walking on eggshells all the time about my past due to his raging insecurity. He'd even have sex with me after I'd tell him I was in pain and couldn't do it for the rest of the day. During one of these times, it hurt so much that I was just starfishing and wincing, so he pulled out and just jacked off to porn next to me in bed while I cried. He acted like it wasn't a big deal because I told him before that it was fine if he's someone that watches porn. I didn't tell my friends because I felt so humiliated, so I just figured it really wasn't a big deal. I mistook his willingness to use me for sex as a continuation of his affectionate side. In reality, I think he was just keeping me around as a sex toy because he'd invite me over then ignore me for hours. I honestly can't believe I ever tolerated that stuff and was willing to forgive it.

He broke up with me at 6 months and, though I could see it coming, it still hurt badly. I have to admit, that was the nicest thing he ever did for me. But the story doesn't end there.

I, stupidly, would still have sex with him. At the time I tried to justify it by taking my sexuality into my own hands....but his verbal abuse got worse. Massively worse. He'd berate me, say I'd probably get r*ped and like it, call me a fucking idiot, a lying whore....and I'd stay because I so desperately wanted to see that good side of him again. It was like he was split into two separate human beings. I desperately wanted him to see the good in me again, and it was hard to accept that a man who once held me in his arms and made me feel like the most perfect woman on earth could now call me a whore and roll his eyes at my tears.

After one night of being berated over text for hours and crying, I even went to his doorstep and gave him a $100 watch that was supposed to arrive months before but only just came in the mail. I reached rock bottom. It was pathetic of me, literally gifting him after he did nothing but hurt me. I just wanted him to like me that badly, and see me like he used to: as more than just some whore. I went there, fully expecting him to yell at me and call me disgusting like he had been all night. But he asked to hug me and told me we could have sex and cuddle and watch a TV show. We had sex...and he kicked me out. I felt like a numb, used shell. I drove directly from his house to a counselor.

Boy did it help. I learned that it is, in fact, okay to be unforgiving. It was hard to get over, and I did sleep with him a few times after out of some desperate sense of loneliness and habit. But I eventually had enough, told him I was no longer doing this with him, and left. It was freeing.

Story should end there right? Of course it doesn't.

Months later he contacts me and says he wants to apologize. At this point I recognized his behavior as toxic but an apology was all I had ever wanted. Just a mere acknowledgement that what I was put through wasn't okay. I didn't want to get back together with him at all, but having dealt with that pain for months, I guess I just wanted to believe that even he wasn't completely heinous and that a lot of his behavior was due to mental illness. I clarified to him that we wouldn't be sleeping together and that I just wanted an apology.

I'm sure most of you would have seen what I couldn't, but I was naive. I thought maybe that other side of him was back and that he actually felt bad. Ha. He ""apologized"" but that wasn't all he did. Long story short, I filed a report over that night and he's been suspended from the school for 2 semesters. Haven't talked to him in over a year now. And I'm not ever going to again.

I know this has all been doom and gloom so far but, ever since then, my life has actually been going pretty well. I moved cities, got into a program I wanted, and have been dating a couple guys. I know I don't want to be in a relationship because I want to focus on myself, so it's all very casual and lighthearted. I no longer tolerate dating men if they disrespect me. Again, this took me a couple months to learn and I did have some pitfalls, but I really grew a pair of ovaries and cut out some toxic people from my life. In fact, I'm currently dating one of the most respectful men I've ever met, and he's never once tried to pressure me into doing something I didn't want to do. I'm a lot more introspective and on guard about my dating life, and it's helped to weed out some douchebags. I'm almost ashamed of myself for ever having stayed with someone that cruel, but I've kept good to my promise (so far) to never let it happen again.

It's okay to be unforgiving.

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for the support! The comments got locked so I didn't get a chance to respond. From the bottom of my heart, I really appreciate it. I hope that, to everyone out there who reads this, you remember that breaking up with an abuser isn't necessarily any easier than breaking up with someone who is more stable. The good times are still good. But if you find yourself frequently crying or unhappy, it's not worth it. You can find someone that brings you good times without making you feel guilty. Hell, it might even be harder to break up with an abuser than a purely loving relationship because you may be worried about their reaction or all their excuses. But you can do it and the temporary loneliness is *SO* worth it, even if they seem like they're the only person on the planet who'll get your sense of humor/interests. They're really not! Take those baby steps!

I saw that someone was curious if he was diagnosed bipolar: yes I believe he was. When he would get particularly mean, he told me he would go back to counseling (but never did). At one point he was also suicidal, which was not abnormal behavior for him according to his friends. Sometimes he would get these kinda nuts ideas about working on Wall Street or whatever, despite having no finance background. He tried to get me to lend him cash for an impulsive buy, got mad at me when I suggested it wasn't a great idea, but then immediately regretted it once I silently complied. I think he may have also had BPD because he would go on these long rants about how he was like a god and my life was meaningless without him. He was narcissistic in a bizarre insecure way. His mean moods seemed to strike suddenly and for seemingly no reason. When I talk about ""two sides"" to him, I don't necessarily mean manic/depressive as the two sides, just that it seemed to be that he could be either loving or cruel. But I guess I'll never know 100% and at this point I supposed it doesn't even matter cause it's not my problem anymore."

"My [43F] brother [50M] says I stole his son [27M] from him, because he's closer with me than him.


My brother has two sons, David (28M) and Martin (27M). Sadly, he's always had a big favorite, and it's David. I wasn't in their early childhood as I was living away for medical school and working, but when I came back they were 14 and 13. I quickly noticed how severe the issue was as my brother was spending all his time and attention on David and was leaving Martin to live by himself. He always took David to places he wanted to go, bought expensive things for him, show interest in everything he was doing and none of that for Martin who always minded his own business.

Back then I remember confronting him about this and his answer was that he just feels a lot more like a father to David than to Martin. I remember him telling me that he thinks Martin is a lost cause when he was about 16 and I won't forget him telling me ""you're welcome if you want to waste your time with him"". I decided to stay around even though I was upset with my brother's behavior because I thought the kids needed me. David never really took any interest even though I tried hard with him but Martin quickly got close to me (and later to my husband). Back when he was 13 he was just desperate for a parental figure to take interest in him and just provide support that all kids that age need.

After David turned 18 and was about to go to college, my brother paid for his tuition, rented an apartment for him and Bankrolled him through college. When Martin turned 18 he did none of that and suggested that he's not good enough to go to college even though he's always been good academically. Martin at that time was totally broken emotionally and my husband and I decided to pay for his tuition on the condition that he performs well and he always did. My brother never showed any real interest in Martin after he turned 18 and he got closer and closer with me and my husband. He spent most holidays with us, always came to us for guidance, and on many times told us that he considers us his true immediate family. After my daughters were born he told us that they make him feel like a sibling and he's great with them and they adore him.

**The current issue at hand however**, is that Martin has become quite successful. He started a startup business when he was 21 and he's been working there ever since and it was just acquired by a major corporation in the industry earlier this year and he's going to be joining them soon. This news was like a bomb in the extended family and everyone were congratulating him and saying they're proud of him and he credited us (not his father or older brother) for his success when someone brought up the topic.

This has created some sort of gossip among the extended family and friends and now my brother is extremely upset. He feels like I stole Martin from him and he told me this which I reminded him of him telling me that Martin is a lost cause which he now denies ever saying. He also believes my husband has taken the ""dad role"" from him in Martin's life and it's all the result of us manipulating him against his father and as such have denied him (and David) the chance to be a family among themselves. He says what we did is nothing short of stealing his child and raising him as our own.

Sadly, he's not just keeping this between us. He's now telling this to everyone and it's creating a mess. My husband and I don't like him doing this, Martin is feeling very uncomfortable about what his father is doing and it's just a big mess which now everyone keeps asking about.

How do we put this to bed?

"I [25F] was contacted by my biological father on Facebook... And I never even knew my dad wasn't my real dad.


So the other day I was contacted on Facebook by a man I didn't know, when I asked him who he was, he told me he was my biological father. This shocked me and I immedeatly messaged my mom, asking him if this was true. She flat out told me to block him, and moved on to talking about Christmas plans. I didn't bring it up again with her because I didn't want to push it. My biological dad told me that she probably just wasn't ready to tell me yet.

My first instinct told me this could be some sort of Facebook scam, and I asked him if he was just looking for money. He laughed and told me no, and that he has a wife and three kids and I would be more than welcome to join their family at any point I am ready. 

Still skeptical, I asked him for more info about me &amp; my mom. He then listed off her favorite bands, where she went to high school, where me and her lived for a while after I was born, and other personal things (none of which she has on her Facebook or anywhere online). He then sent me a picture of photographs and Polaroids of me as a baby with him. Photos that I remember seeing in old photo albums at my parent's house. Photos that in no way anyone else would have.

He was very genuine and kind. He explained that him and my mom had a falling out after I was born, and that he was young and immature. She made him leave, and its possible she was dating my dad at the same time (which explains why I was 2 years old at their wedding). The crazy thing is that I always joked with my friends about me being adopted. I look mixed Asian, my dad has blonde hair and blue eyes (as do my two younger siblings). A lot of people comment 'are you mixed?' Or 'are you part Japanese?' Turns out I now know I am half Korean since my bio dad is Korean and my mom is Canadian. 

I'm wondering how to approach the subject with my parents. Surely my dad must know, considering I look nothing like him. He also fought with my mom a lot until I was 13 and my sister was born. His side of the family has also treated me a little differently. 

I'm worried my mom will keep denying it even though my bio dad contacted me and gave me proof. If she kept a secret for 25 years, there's no need for her to tell me now, is there? I am pretty confused as to why she would continue to lie after I found out. My dad is still my dad, I'll always be a part of his life and he has done so much for me. I don't plan on breaking up or hurting the family. Any advice on how to ask my parents about my bio dad? I do plan on getting a DNA test with him.

TL;DR: My biological dad reached out to me and now my mom is denying he's my dad, how do I ask her to tell me the truth

"I [24 F] am considering calling Adult protective services for my brother [24 M] and mother [48 F]. Terrified this is the wrong choice...could use some outsider's input.


I'm sorry if this ends up being lengthy. I feel some background info is important. I hope someone has the patience to read through. Also sorry for any typos, I'm writing this all up on my mobile.      

I guess I should start off saying that I have been no contact with my mother for most of the year. Her and I have always had a strained relationship, and it all came to a head about 8 months ago. 
I live in a different state all together now, but my mother, her boyfriend and my brother all still live together in their single wide trailer.      

I harbor a lot of resentment towards her. She was not the best mother growing up. Don't get me wrong, she tried. And she isn't a terrible person. She had it very, very hard growing up and I honestly feel like that broke her, and made it harder for her to know how to take care of my brother and I properly. That said, some things she has done I can't bring myself to forgive, and effect my brother and I to this day.  I guess I'll just break each issue into sections so this does get too jumbled. 

**Drinking**      

First, she has always had a bad drinking problem. It fluctuates between daily drinking and a couple times a week. Always to the point of being completely wasted.   
When she does drink it is always a scene. Crying, anger, paranoia, lashing out at the people around her. Her boyfriend, who she has been with for 8 years now, also has a bad drinking problem and they often get into horrible fights. A couple times a year it becomes physical between the two. Everyone in the house is effected and often dragged into the drama when she drinks.   
As young children we begged my mother to stop drinking multiple times, but that always led to her blowing up at us because 'she was an adult and wouldn't have kids telling her what to do'.   

**Hoarding** 

My mom is an animal hoarder. There's no other way to put it. It started off with us adopting two kittens when I was 13, and they were never fixed. And then we took in a stray. And they just... multiplied. At the worst point there were easily 35 cats in total. Probably more. Litters of kittens every couple weeks. All horribly sick and inbread. The trailer became a litter box. Cat shit and piss all over the floors.    
It became overwhelming and my mom started taking litters of newborn kittens out to the shed in the yard where they would end up dying from heat or cold because she couldn't handle more cats in the house.   
Now due to rampant sicknesses and my mother 'Thinning out the herd' she is down to about 11 cats. All of which she loves fiercely. She insists that they are better off with her than in a shelter, where they would be killed.    
I have tried and tried to talk to her about the cats and how filthy everything is because of it (which has contributed to a obsessive germaphobia in my brother, I will address this more later) but she shuts down any criticism about her cats. She says that they make her feel needed and loved, and they are better to her than any humans have been. The cats are now held in higher regards than anyone else in her life.    

**Living conditions**

Between all the cats, lack of funds and general upkeep the trailer they live in is little better than a shack.    

No hot water at all for the last 6 years (broken water heater, could not afford to get fixed).      

Barely any water coming into the house at all (Broken water pipe outside, they could not fix so the water is shut off most of the time, when they do turn it on the sinks barely trickle. They collect water with a bucket outside for daily needs).    

Huge holes in the floor. It's an old mobile home, and there are spots where the floor has just... broken. The bathroom is the worse. You can literally see the ground outside. The holes are covered with dismantled cabinet doors or random pieces of plywood. You have to be really careful where you step because we have all literally fallen into the hole in the bathroom.    

Broken toilet. The toilet tank broke years ago. You have to pour a bucket of water into the bowl to flush it. Because of the huge hole in the bathroom you can't put full weight on the seat while doing your business, because the toilet is dangerously close to falling through the floor as well.     

Broken windows. Most of the windows have been broken in the trailer. Resulting in HOT summers and very, very cold winters.   

And lastly, speaking of cold winters, we spent an entire winter about 6 years back with no electricity. My mother boiled water on the stove all day and night to add heat into the house. Resulting in horrible mold throughout the home.    

**Medical neglect** 

My mother does not like doctors, and absolutely refuses any medicine.    
She is not healthy. She is quite overweight, and was told about 13 years ago that she was showing early signs of Multiple Sclerosis. She ignored this completely and now spends most of her days in horrible pain. She refuses any treatment for it because that would 'be admitting I'm sick, and would make it worse'.   
She had a bad fall over a year ago now, and broke her foot badly in multiple spots. She did actually go to the ER for this where they told her she would need surgery to fix it in a week's time. She never went back for the surgery because she believed she would just 'take it easy and walk it off'. Last we spoke it was still badly broken and not healing.

My brother is on the spectrum (Aspergers), which in itself isn't an issue, but in the last few years has shown a BAD decline in his mental health (will go farther into this in a minute). My mother refuses to see a specialist for him and get him any help at all.

**Educational neglect** 

This is dragging on. I apologize, but this needs to be added.   
When my brother and I were in 5th and 6th grade, my mom pulled us from public schools completely to 'homeschool' us. We fell through the cracks and never received any form of education after that point. I have done alright. We were lucky to have a working computer with internet access most of my childhood. That became our teacher. But my brother and I are still very behind in many areas.    
Because we weren't in school we were very isolated. My mom drilled into out heads that CPS would take us away if anyone found out we weren't in school. We weren't allowed outside most of the time. Any interactions with adults or the rare person my age were heavily coached (Lies about what school we went to and programs we were in). The lack of social interaction has been very damaging for my brother, who already had difficulty with social interaction because of his Autism.    

**Brother's mental state** 

This is the big one. The reason I'm considering calling APS in the first place.    
My brother is not well. Between the lack of social interaction, lack of education and the general clusterfuck that was our home life he is a shell of his former self. He spends 95% of his time in his bedroom. He is terrified of germs and obsessively washes his hands upwards of 30 times a day. The skin between his fingers is always cracked and bleeding or raw. His computer is his only outlet, and he becomes enraged when people touch it because our hands are 'filthy'.    

His sleep schedule is completely backwards. He sleeps all day and is up all night. He has zero friends. He has never held hand with or kissed a girl. He is extremely sexually frustrated and has started to hate women in general.     
Before moving out of state a few years ago I had to spend a couple nights on my mom's couch. I would wake up to him walking in circles around the kitchen for hours mumbling to himself. Sometimes becoming very angry and sounding like he was arguing with someone.    
When I brought this up with my mom she admitted she had concern about it, but that it was a normal coping mechanism for him because he had nobody to talk to.    
She has also admitted that he has told her he hears voices, often feels like there are people outside his bedroom window, and scariest of all, he once had an episode where he saw a demon's face in our hallway. After seeing it he blacked out and woke up on his bed with no recollection of going to sleep at all.     


Obviously, I'm really worried about him. He is terrified of the outside world. He is convinced he is going to get beaten up by people of other races if he leaves the house (my mom is extremely racist, they are the only white family in a heavily Hispanic area and my mom feeds this fear of his often. It doesn't help that she has made enemies of all of her neighbors).    
He hasn't gone farther than our driveway in years. He doesn't go outside at all most of the time. He just stays in his room.    


I'm going to wrap this up now. Again, I'm sorry for the length. It's hard deciding what was relevant, and what wasn't.    
Like I said, my mother and I no longer talk. But I constantly worry about the state of things for them. The only person working is her boyfriend, they barely scrap by most of the time. I constantly wonder how much worse it can get. I don't see anything changing for my brother. 
When we were speaking I had offered to move them in with my husband and I to get them out if that trailer, but my mother refuses to leave because she wouldn't be able to take her cats. Any time my mother and I have fought she goes to my brother crying about how how bad I am, and has fabricated lies about how I have trashed him to 'outsiders', so he absolutely hates me now and hasn't spoken a word to me in years. So taking him in is a no go.    

I don't know what to do for them. I feel like I'm just waiting for a phone call saying my mom has died from her poor health, or that my mom or my brother have killed themselves. I don't even know if Adult protective services could do anything, or what they would do at all. I could use some advice. 

**TL;DR**: Mom and brother are in a very unhealthy situation. I don't know if calling APS is the right move. Fear they won't help and my family will end up worse off. Looking for options.

**Edit**: I have gotten a lot of great advice so far, and I am still reading every single reply made. I am very appreciative for the help and kind words. 
For those of you who have PMed me to sling abuse because I am slightly less concerned about my mother's cats than I am about human lives, and those who are assuming I am being a 'keyboard psychiatrist' about my brother (who HAS been diagnosed as on the spectrum by a real doctor)... simmer down.

My lifelong friend chooses to be homeless. He works for an outdoor education program which provides housing Monday - Thursday and then he will normally go camping Friday - Sunday, he is into that.

Unfortunately he will frequently come into the city and ask one of his friends if he can crash on their couch for a night or more. My brother offers his couch frequently but I know this is causing a strain on his relationship with his fiancé and his own personal stress. 

His outdoor ed job is on break through the holiday and he has asked if he can crash at my place with the excuse being xmas and ""he thought it would be nice to catch up"".

Not using a throwaway.

So, I've not quite run into this kind of an issue with anyone in my life ever. Sarah (32/F) is absolutely one of my very best friends on the face of the planet. When she and I met we just ""got it"" with each other. She is the MOH in my upcoming wedding and her husband is officiating. Easily one of the best people on the planet, which is definitely not the issue here. 

So, a year ago I moved to another city 3 hours away from where Sarah and I best friended out for 6 years to be with my now-fiance (33M), Clark. Sarah had given birth to her beautiful baby girl 9 months earlier and all seemed well. Clark and I have been planning (and paying for) what we feel like is going to be the best party that we could ever throw for ourselves and our friends and family in our current home city. Since then, I have had a couple of issues with Sarah that I'm not really sure how to handle, because, frankly, I thought I already had. First, she just assumed that her baby was going to be IN the wedding as a flower girl. We never spoke about that. She never asked. Just brought up how cute she was going to look walking down the aisle throwing rose petals around. Now, Clark and I looooooove her baby. BUT, no children under 18 are invited. We don't have kids and we don't have nieces and/or nephews yet. For a few other reasons that are totally unrelated to this post, we just don't want kids at our wedding. So, I had to explain that to her....again. She genuinely seemed pretty embarrassed by it, so I let it. Mom brain or something. Ok. Cool. 

So now, here we are a few months away from the big day. Several months ago she asked if she and her husband could stay at our house the weekend of the wedding. (We have a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house) I immediately let her know that my parents, two brothers and sister in law were staying at our place and we didn't have the room to accommodate anyone else. She said ""Oh, we will just stay on an air mattress in the living room or den. No big deal."". My response to that was that I was sorry, but it's just too many people. I should also mention, in order to accommodate my own family, Clark and I aren't even staying at OUR house. We are staying downtown near the venue the entire wedding weekend. A month or two after that I was venting to her about some family drama with one of my brothers and her response was ""Oh, good. Now there is room for me and hubby to stay at your house."". She assumed he would not be coming to the wedding. I let her know that he was still likely coming and that it would probably blow over....and it has. So, about a month ago I sent out an email to the bridesmaids and groomsmen regarding the hotel blocks for that weekend so they could get a room booked, if they wanted, before the invites went out. I asked everyone to get back with me on where they booked so I could make sure we blocked enough and we could add more if need be. Every single person responded except Sarah. I think that she thinks she is still staying at my house and I'm not really sure of how to bring this up. First of all, I don't feel like I should be dealing with where people are staying. We are all adults. Second, I don't feel like I owe them anything just because she is the MOH and he is officiating. I have struggled with that thought internally, but I am gifting the hell out of both of them and don't feel like shelter has to be a part of that. Next, I don't pretend to understand anyone's financial obligations, but these people go on exotic vacations every year. They NEVER visit us...we are ALWAYS driving there on weekends to see them. We are constantly going out of our way for them and mainly because they have almost 2-year old and we get they don't have the same freedoms. (I will admit that I feel a little bit burned by this. I see her post on social media all the time having drinks and nights out with the girls sans baby. I have not had one single day or night with her unless the baby was there in almost 2 years. She's gone on two international vacations without the baby.). So, anyway, I don't feel like money is the issue. In addition to that, none of my bridesmaids have put out more than $50 for the wedding. Their dresses were $35 each and I do not want a shower or party. So, it's can't be a ""I've spent all of my dollars on this wedding, give me your house"" kind of thing. 

Reddit, WTF am I missing here? Should I just not say anything else and wait for this to blow up in my face in 3 months? Should I approach her AGAIN about it? I have been the most accommodating, low-key person about everything. Clark and I are putting a ton of money into this so that everyone has a great time. We are gifting our attendants and they basically won't pay for one single meal the entire weekend and it all seems like it is just expected and then MORE MORE MORE is expected on top of that. help.

UPDATE: Thanks for commenting, guys! Though I have not had a chance to respond to everyone, I have read every comment and appreciate every perspective, including the ones that basically call me out for being a shitty friend (?) and somehow changed this into me being resentful of my bestie's baby. But, this is really only my perspective. Sounds like some of ya'll got burned before. Anywho, I'm gonna talk to Clark this evening about it again. I really felt like since we were paying for so many meals the entire weekend, gifting the hell out of everyone and paying for copious amounts of booze, we really weren't on the hook for where they were staying. Also, I've asked to pay her husband for officiating. They told me to see this as their wedding gift to us. So, I think it'll just be the right thing for me to pay for their room. I definitely don't want this to turn into any kind of resentment or drama. Sure, she and I probably have some other subjects that could/should be discussed, but honestly, that's how friendships go sometimes. That doesn't make her a narcissist, you guys. And it doesn't make me a lunatic that hates babies and homesitters. So, again, THANK YOU so much for helping me see other sides to my hotel room pancake.

"Me [26F] with my friend from college [27F] is getting married, asked me to be maid of honor, but...


This might be a simple fix, but here it goes anyway.

I have a friend from college who is getting married next September. She told me about it over the summer in one of the few and far between conversations that we've had in the past few years. After college, she moved from Michigan (where I still am) to Colorado and I barely hear from her anymore. The thing is, even when she was still in Michigan, I hardly heard from her anyway. Which makes it weird that she would ask me to be in her wedding, let alone maid of honor. We've had many falling outs and getting back togethers, only to fall out again. I call her my fair-weather friend, because she only seems to talk to you when it's convenient for her. I have tried many times to call or text her, only to be ignored. Until she has some big news to share, then she suddenly reappears. 

When I found out she was getting married, I knew I would probably at least be invited. The wedding is in Colorado though, and between getting time off from work, the flight, the hotel, etc., I knew I wouldn't be in the best financial situation to go. Then she suddenly started calling me all the time (while I was at work or the gym, so I didn't pick up). When I didn't answer, she would text ""Call me, I have something to ask you!"" That's when my ""oh crap"" meter started going off. I knew she was going to ask me to be a bridesmaid (even more money I don't have). She finally caught me at a time I could talk last night and she asked me to be maid of honor. And I didn't know what to say. I wasn't planning on going as a guest, I was going to let her down gently as a bridesmaid, but the maid of honor? I don't know what to do. 

Help?

EDIT: She did mention ""helping me out"" with the financial side of things, something I'm not comfortable with (I don't like when my parents give me money, why should I let her?). I am planning on telling her no, wishing her the best, and sending a gift when the wedding gets closer. A lot of you had some great suggestions on what to say, and I'll let you know how it goes once I talk to her again. "

"My (33F) husband (46M) of 8 years is increasingly jealous of men in my life and it’s now affecting my career.


Some background: My husband (we’ll call him Bob for this story) and I met through a mutual interest 10 years ago and after being friends for a few months we started dating and our relationship took off. We were married the following year and now have a 5 year old daughter. We probably argue more than most couples, mostly due to cultural differences such as this (I am American, he grew up in South America). He is an amazing father and good provider.

I recently earned a promotion at my job and Bob was happy for me but not as excited as I’d thought he would be. I’ve been in my profession for 7 years and this was my first move up and it came with a nice raise. Whatever, he doesn’t really get excited about anything. 

Last week, the president of our small company came to talk to me about traveling to our warehouse in another state - with my boss who we’ll call Joe - to observe and help with an annual process there. I was asked to do this task because I am moving up the ladder and would eventually take over my boss’s position so I should understand this process. The president was giving me 60 days’ notice that I would be traveling for 3 days (2 nights) in February. I immediately knew how Bob would feel about this and became physically upset in front of the president. I simply told the president that I needed to talk to my husband about it first and left it at that for now.

I took a break and went outside to call Bob and tell him. As I predicted his immediate response was no. It became a no way in hell when I told him Joe would be there also. I explained to Bob that this is expected of me as I was just promoted and they want me to grow with the company but it didn’t matter. I became more upset as I realized the only solution is for me to recant my promotion in favor of someone who could travel and possibly be fired or simply find another job before that happened. 

I’ve been at my current job for 3 years and particularly like it. I left my previous 2 jobs to move for Bob’s career. I finally get a chance to grow my career and I’m expected to turn it down because of his insecurity issues? The more I think about it the more I think that Bob doesn’t care about my happiness. This past summer Bob took a week vacation with a group of people he met through our mutual interest. He had fun and I was glad to pick-up the slack at home so he could enjoy himself. In light of recent events I realize he would never let me do a similar trip.

I’ve never cheated on him but I did tell him that I cheated on my previous boyfriend (what a mistake that was). Bob is very much threatened by older men in my life (he thinks that’s who I’m attracted to) and cannot accept that his jealousy pushes me away from him more than anything. Joe doesn’t help the situation either. He is a narcissistic ass (brags about how much money he has, how much he travels, etc) but otherwise a good boss (always vouches for the team to get the most out of the annual raise, let’s me bring my kid to work when she’s sick, doesn’t micromanage, etc.). I vent to Bob about Joe in hopes he’ll see my transparency and realize Joe is nothing more than my boss but it just fuels his hatred.

My current dilemma is how do I not resent Bob for this forever? I’ve accepted his jealous tendencies in the past and we’ve worked on setting boundaries to help him (basically I have no relationships with men other than at work). Even if I do get another job he'll probably be jealous of some man there (the only job I've had that he liked was when I worked with 4 other women).

Our house is currently on the market with hopes of moving closer to our jobs (partially fueled by my raise). Now I’m thinking I should take this opportunity to explore my options. I definitely don’t want to choose a job over my relationship but if this is how it’s going to be now would be a good breaking point before we dump our savings into a new home. I don’t have a relationship with my immediate family because they never accepted Bob (a long story) and this would really be the best time to start over for myself and my daughter.

TL;DR: Husband is jealous, won't allow me to travel for my job since my jerkish boss is going. How do I not resent husband?


EDIT/Small Update/Clarification: Wow, thank you for all of the advice! I feel like Bob has been run over by the bus here by my poor ability to summarized our relationship into a few paragraphs. I don't feel physically threatened by him but I do now see how this behavior is controlling. I understand the concern about our age difference but it is me who seeks older friendships (less drama). And the part about my family should be clarified - my mother is blatantly racist and hated Bob from day 1 because he was from a third world country but was still doing better in life than her 2 precious sons. Thanks to /r/raisedbynarcissists for some clarity on that part of my life. My brothers have chosen her side as they need her help babysitting their 100 kids that they keep having.

While hard to read/accept I used your comments as the confidence and support I needed to confront Bob last night. I told him I was going on the trip and it was up to him how our relationship would proceed. Of course, he blew up at first but I maintained my position. I suggested counseling and he scoffed at me and left. He cooled off and we resumed our discussion for it to end when he blamed me for the way he was. I admit, I have lied to him in the past about men in my life but it was honestly me being afraid to tell him because of how he reacts. He holds these things against me to this day as the start of an affair. An example: I texted my old boss at 9pm with some funny beer meme and said ""This reminds me of you"" or something stupid. It was stupid and unnecessary, I know but he snooped in my phone to find it and it definitely doesn't mean I'm sleeping with him (because I didn't). In his mind I did sleep with him and am guilty until proven innocent. This was more than 3 years ago. There are maybe 2 other incidents like this that he says justify his jealousy.

Back to last night - he told me he needed a break and moved to the spare room. I fell asleep and he woke me at midnight to ask me not to disrupt our daughter's life. We talked for a couple of hours but never reached a solution. Here is how we left it:

Bob - I need your help.
Me - Name it
Bob - I need you to communicate with me when you're there. Tell me what's going on.
Me - No problem. I do that anyway. We are always in contact. Is that all you need? Is that our solution?
Bob - I don't know.
Then he left and I haven't spoken to him since.

I did speak to my president this morning. I apologized for my behavior, reiterated my dedication to the company and told him I'd do whatever was required of the job. He is very reasonable and said I didn't need to apologize  and he fully expects his employee's personal lives to come before the job, so at least that part went well and my job is intact."
"My [27M] in-laws sent me a ton of gifts and warm thoughts. My family didn't even include my wife [27F] of 5 years on the Christmas card. How should I react?


[removed]"
"My [24F] in laws [60sM/F] are having a hard time adjusting to new traditions and it's starting to create friction.


I want to start this off by saying that I really do love my in laws and overall have a great relationship with them, this is just one issue that's started to come up recently especially with the holidays.

For some background, my husband [24M] and I grew up with very different family dynamics (which I really do try to keep in mind when situations like this arise). My husband lived in the same house his entire life with his mom, dad and two brothers. Myself and his friends always joke that he has the most normal all-American family ever. They really do look like they could have been cut out of a Good Housekeeping magazine. 

I was an only child of divorced parents who split when I was very young. I probably moved around 10 times by the time I was 18. My relationship with both of my parents was very dysfunctional in very different ways (we've since mended the wounds and I have a good relationship with both). As a result I became a very independent, introverted child who spent much of my childhood in my room reading. 

My husband is extremely close with his parents and in some ways the closeness is foreign to me and in other ways I feel it borders on codependency. There have been a few times when I've had to confront him about ""cutting the cord"" so to speak. I really do love that he is so close to his family but sometimes it just feels excessive.

When he was 20 his girlfriend of two months at the time became pregnant. This was in no way planned and he was still living with his parents at the time. As a result, for the first year of Hannah's [3F] life she lived with my husband and his parents, so I understand this created a unique, special bond that could be why his parents are having a hard time lately.

With me coming into the picture, Hannah now has three sets of grandparents between my husband and I. By far, we see and spend much more time with my husband's parents, but I've reminded him lately that it's just as important that Hannah gets to spend time with her other grandparents as well. Both of my parents immediately embraced her with open arms and when we became engaged they both spoke excitedly about becoming grandparents, which was pretty adorable. My husband and I plan on having two more children within the next few years and I want our children to have great relationships with all of their grandparents. 

I've even started inviting his parents when we're with either my mom or dad but the reality is that it just doesn't always work out that way. For example, my parents invited myself, my husband and Hannah to go get dinner and then walk around to look at Christmas lights, which I then invited his parents to. But there are just going to be some times when we're only with my mom or only with my dad and stepmom. It now feels like my husband is keeping score. Anytime we do something with one of my parents, we then have to compensate by doing an activity with his parents, even though as I mentioned we spend MUCH more time with his parents. For example, when we went with my parents to a local tree farm to cut down a tree (an annual family tradition) my husband then had to compensate by saying we would hold off on cutting down a tree and go with his parents to pick out a pre-cut tree. Which was fine but once again felt like we were ""keeping score"".

Another example was last weekend when my husband went with his parents to visit his grandmother. Hannah and I stayed in town because she had a Christmas performance at gymnastics. I invited my mom and afterwards we went to a local event where she got to meet Santa and take a picture (my husband didn't care that I took her without him, he's not really into that whole thing). I was sending my husband photos this whole time and after Hannah met Santa he said ""My mom said she's a jealous grandma right now because she wasn't the first one to take Hannah to meet Santa"". Which seemed slightly passive aggressive and irritated me because they have had LOTS of firsts with Hannah and why are we keeping score anyways?!

Last week there was a special screening of my favorite Christmas movie at the local theater. I immediately booked tickets for my husband and I and then told my dad and stepmom they should come too because it's also my dad's favorite Christmas movie. My husband then said we shouldn't mention it to his parents because he didn't want them to be jealous or sad, which was just ridiculous to me. 

The final incident happened a couple days ago. We were discussing our Christmas plans and how we would split time between everyone. We had already agreed to spend all of Christmas Eve with his family, and then on Christmas day after Hannah's mom picked her up we would go to my dad's family's house and spend the day there. I won't even get to see my mom at all over the holidays. In the past I would wake up at 6 and go over to my dad's house on Christmas morning to open presents with my little brother and sister, which is what my husband, Hannah and I did last year, but told my husband that this year I felt it was time to start our own Christmas morning traditions with our family. He then said that after speaking with his mom about our Christmas plans she had reminded him that after my dad's last year we had gone over to their house so they were able to open presents with Hannah and she would like that to happen again this year.

I put my foot down and said that would not be happening. I reminded him that we would be spending all of Christmas Eve with his family and that I wanted us to have our own family traditions, and the reality was that as we get older and our family continues to grow, we just won't be able to make everyone happy all the time. I also reminded him that Hannah's time was being stretched thin between two sets of parents and four sets of grandparents so unfortunately it just wouldn't be realistic to see everyone for every holiday. He reluctantly agreed.

I get that this is just coming from a place of love and their desire to spend as much time as possible with Hannah and I'm really trying to accommodate them as much as possible, but I feel like it's starting to get ridiculous and I'm tired of walking on eggshells around their feelings. 

How can I address this with both my husband and my in laws without coming off like a total asshole? I love the relationship Hannah has with my in laws, it really is special, but there are more people in Hannah's life now who love her and have relationships with her and want to spend time with her. In no way am I trying to take Hannah away from them, I just feel like I'm being pulled in a hundred different directions trying to please everyone and it's exhausting.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My in laws are struggling with the fact that they aren't the only grandparents in the picture anymore, how can I nicely put my foot down and get them to understand that everyone wants quality time with Hannah and we're doing the best we can?"
"I [22 F] pulled away from my friend [21 M] of 1.5 years because he turned me down... now my friends are saying I am being a ""nice-guy"" about it and that I am being selfish. Now I'm confused.


First account--lurked for a long time, but never had a need to post before. I could use some help though--I thought I made the right call ending a friendship over unrequited feelings, but now I've had several trusted friends question my choice and my perception of things, and I'm just lost.

""Matt"" [21M] and I [22F] became friends at the start of our Junior year of college (we are half way through senior year right now). He had just transferred in, and I was volunteering with orientation for transferred. Turned out that he was also in one of my classes, and we got talking and hit if off great, and were soon good friends. We have the same major (though different sub-concentrations) and have had at least one class together for the last three semesters, and we always sat together in class, would grab coffee before/after, and usually met for drinks or for studying 3-4 times a week. Basically we saw each other almost every day. We would also go out to dinner fairly regularly (usually with a small group of friends, but one-on-one as well). 

This summer we both were staying in our college's city for internships, and as my apartment was closer to his job then his was he would crash on my couch a few nights a week, and eventually he just left a backpack of his stuff at my apartment. We also went on a few day trips to beaches nearby (usually with others, but once just the two of us).
  
Before anyone asks, no we never slept together. We both dated around, but weren't in relationships for more then a month or two with other people. For the longest time we were just really good platonic friends. 

However, I always was aware that Matt is attractive, and about 9 months ago I realized I was developing perhaps a bit more then a crush on him. But at the time he was in a fling with another girl, and then when that ended I had time to realize that if he had been interested in more he could have made a move a long time ago, so I put it out of my mind. 

While we always did joke about sex (lots of ""that's what she said"" type jokes) starting the end of this summer I felt like the sex-talk changed. We started talking about sexual experiences and fantasies, and even began making joke-comments directed at each other. He also got really weirdly jealous on two different occasions this fall--once at a start of the year party, when I was flirting with a cute guy and Matt suddenly was stuck to my side/interjecting himself into the conversation, and another time when I went on a few dates with a guy and Matt seemed overly interested in how the dates went, almost quizzing me. He also started complementing me a lot, and when we would go out partying would usually end up cuddling against my side. 

So, I figured he was starting to like me, right? The crush was still there, and as there seemed to be interest I straight up asked him out one evening. Said that I liked him as friend, but also as more then a friend, and if he was interested I'd be up for exploring the more-then-friend bit. He seemed a bit surprised, but turned me down (nicely).  This was in late September. Afterwards I went back to treating him like a friend, and started pulling back on some of the more sexual, flirty stuff. But if anything Matt seemed to ramp it up a bit. This was the period where the weird over-inquisitive-questioning about the guy I was briefly dating happened. 

Finally, after a lot of thinking about it and talking it over with my sister, I decided that I needed to back off on the friendship. I still liked him a LOT, and the flirting hadn't stopped (not just his fault--I would flirt back). It didn't seem healthy. But, due to how close our friendship was I thought I owed it to him to let him know why. So before we left for break I pulled him aside, and let him know that I still had feelings for him and because of that I would need to town down the friendship for a bit. 

Since then, though, I've had three different people tell me to my face that I am doing the same thing to him that ""nice guys"" do to girls all the time--become close friends just to hookup, and then get mad when sex doesn't happen. **I** don't feel like this is what happened. We were friends first, and I feel like he was flirting (though maybe I am wrong?). Who knows why he didn't want to date me, that is completely his choice and I get that... but isn't it also my choice to pull away from a close friendship that for me has crossed a line? I read on here all the time about friendships that are too intimate and bother a partner, and when I was talking to my sister she pointed out that another guy might have a problem with a male friend who I ate dinner with and who crashed in my apartment all the time and stuff. To be completely fair, I did tell her all about my feelings for Matt, so idk if she was really impartial.

I guess I was so confidant at first in my choice, but now I'm second guessing myself. Did I ""nice-guy"" him? I mean, two of my friends were arguing with me that I was over reading it and friendships like that are normal for students. It didn't feel normal though. Guys, do you have female friends you act like that with? I mean, I have talked about sex and sexual fantasies with my female friends, so maybe that is where they are coming from. But this just felt more intimate?

  **tl;dr**: Was really close friends with a dude for over a year. Liked him. Thought he was flirting. Asked him out and was turned down. Stayed friends for a bit, felt the flirting continued, as did my feelings. Ended the friendship... now am being told I ""nice-guy""ed him. Did I?"
"My [30/F] husband's [40/M] daughter [18/F] has been using photos of me to catfish men on the internet.


Firstly, I had no idea any of this was going on until I received a direct message from a strange man on Facebook. He messaged me saying someone was stealing my photos and posting them to a fake account on both Instagram, Facebook and Tinder. The name he gave me was unfamiliar to me. Beth. I don't know any Beth's. That said, he linked me to the profiles and said he had met ""Beth"" on Tinder, added her on Facebook and Instagram, and had an online relationship with her for nearly a year. He's from Seattle, Washington. Beth, who said she was living in LA, had gone to Seattle around a year ago for business, and that was how they had initially matched together on Tinder. Just for clarification, my husband, step-daughter and I, are from Canada. A few hours away from Seattle, Washington. 


According to Beth's Facebook and Instagram profiles, she's 25 years old and she works for the aerospace research division of a university in SoCal. 


Yeah. 


She has spent the past year avoiding a face-to-face meeting or video call with this man. He's quite busy so he initially didn't think anything of it, but he figured if she's so passionately against video chatting or meeting in person, she must be hiding something. He eventually did some digging and performed a reverse image search on Google, and *bam*. He found the real Beth (aka me). This discovery came about roughly three months ago. Why he chose to contact me now instead of three months ago, I have no idea. I'm guessing he felt somewhat attached to ""Beth"" given how long their interaction had gone on, and maybe he was hoping the real ""Beth"" would eventually reveal herself and pursue a relationship with him. 


In any case, he kind of duped himself on this one. Beth told him she was from Vancouver and still had a Vancouver phone number, not a California number. If she's working and living in LA, she should have a California number, no? Anyway. There are quite a few holes in his story but this isn't about him. This is about my step-daughter. 


I figured out it was her from the phone number. Turns out, she and Beth have the same phone number. My photos have been used for a fake profile once in the past, which is why I my social media profiles are locked and protected via whatever privacy settings are available to me. Right away I knew ""Beth"" had to be someone close to me in my life as they're the only ones with access to my photos and social media profiles. Now that I know ""Beth"" is actually my step-daughter, and that she has been using my photos to fool this man (and others via Tinder) I don't really know what to do. I've reported the profiles to Facebook and Instagram and had them removed. The Tinder one is gone now, too. I guess you need a Facebook account to use that app. 


Now that ""Beth"" is gone, the only thing left is for me to talk to my step-daughter. Only I don't know if I should. The guy who contacted me had also mentioned that he told ""Beth"" he knows she's not who she says she is, and that he was going to message the real woman behind the photos to tell her someone's posing as her. He hasn't the slightest idea that ""Beth"" is my step-daughter, and frankly, there is no way I'm telling him. I understand he feels hurt and betrayed and that he was essentially duped for a year by a random stranger, but he also seems very unstable and vindictive. It seems to me the only reason he contacted me was because ""Beth"" had taken too long to answer one of his texts. That's how it came off in the screenshots he sent me. 


To break it down, the profiles have been reported and removed, and my step-daughter likely knows that I know, so I'm not sure if saying anything will help. Of course, she could always steal someone else's photos and create new profiles, and dupe a whole new batch of men, but I'd like to think she wouldn't continue. Not after being caught like this. 


Our relationship is pretty standard. She's staying with her father and I at home for the holidays. In fact she's just down the hallway right now. I know I should probably say something, I just don't know how to go about it. We're cool with each other, but we're not close. I've been married to her father for two years. She has always been kind to me, and I have always been kind to her. We're good at keeping it casual and friendly. I've never scolded her before, nor do I want to. My options are pretty clear. (1) I could just forget this happened and hope that she won't do this again, (2) I could talk to her myself and let her know she's smart and beautiful and she doesn't have to pose as someone else in order to attract men, or (3) I could tell her father and let him do the talking. He's quite a reasonable man. Very honest and open and protective without being overbearing. I'm sure if I were to tell him, he would handle the situation in a firm but caring manner. That said, my step-daughter would be mortified if he knew. 


On the one hand I do feel for her, but on the other hand she violated my trust and my privacy. Yes, photos are just photos, but my photos and profiles are protected *because* I don't like the idea of random strangers looking at them. I don't post anything particularly risqué but I do have a few photos from a trip to Hawaii that I had taken this past June, and I know my step-daughter sent them to her online bf as ""spank bank material"". That's a big violation IMO. 


What should I do? She's still quite young, and although she probably knows that what she did was wrong, I really don't think it came from a malicious place. She's likely just bored and looking for an escape. I don't really know how to go about handling this. Suggestions? 


TL;DR - My step-daughter has been catfishing men online using my personal photos. I've since reported those profiles as fakes and had them removed. Her online boyfriend was the one who told me there was someone posing as me on the internet. He doesn't know she's my step-daughter. But because he told her he was going to contact the ""real girl in the pictures"" she likely knows that I know now. I've had the profiles removed, so there's no worry of her continuing to use my photos. Should I let it go or should I talk to her? I don't plan on scolding her as that's not my place. I just want to know why she would do this and maybe open a line of communication between us so she knows she can trust me.

"UPDATE: I [19 F] and getting really creeped out by this guy [?? M] that I work with


Hey guys, I just wanted to provide an update to everyone who responded to my previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ed6uu/i_19_f_and_getting_really_creeped_out_by_this_guy/), as I have taken some of your advice and some of you wanted to make sure I was ok (you are all so sweet, I love you all). Here's a huge ""thank you"" to everyone who responded.

Summary of OP: I have been volunteering at a nonprofit after school. There is a really intimidating guy displaying possibly creepy behavior towards me and I was feeling really uncomfortable.

Update: Well, the nonprofit that I was volunteering at was closed over Thanksgiving week, as all of the kids were out of school, but we're back this week and have returned to a normal schedule.
So, I took the advice of tbarnes472 and told Pete how much I loved a movie that I absolutely hate. As soon as I started talking about it, he completely trashed the movie, which apparently means he's out to scare me rather than date me (kinda glad about that as he's A LOT older than me). I wasn't really sure what to do with that information, but good to know.

Yesterday, I went to talk to one of the other employees, who is the one in charge of scheduling and choosing our assignments. I explained the situation and asked her if she could rearrange the schedule so that I wouldn't be alone with Pete anymore. She told me that it wasn't possible, as he and I are the only ones who volunteer at that time, so I talked to my boyfriend and he agreed to volunteer with me, so I wouldn't be alone. He started on Wednesday, and everything went really smoothly, Pete didn't talk to me the entire time and I felt so much better.

That's all I have, for now. If things keep going as they did yesterday with by boyfriend present, then I'd say that the situation is resolved. Thank you all so much. You truly are the best.

  **tl;dr**: tried the movie thing on Pete and he shot my movie down. Talked to the organizer and she said I couldn't avoid Pete. My BF is volunteering with me now, so I'm not alone."

"My [40m] daughter [18f] is planning on getting married and moving abroad with her foreign boyfriend [18m]. Wife [38f] is distraught about her decision and is going crazy. Don't know how to handle her?


Our daughter has always been interested in travel and going to other countries. She had the opportunity to go overseas in her early years of high school over the summer to France to study the language more, and she told us it was the best experience of her life. She fell in love with the country, and even talked of moving there. My wife and I didn't really take her too seriously. We had hoped maybe letting her go abroad would quench some of her wanderlust a bit.

In her junior year, she had met this boy that she came to really ""like"". At first we were not aware that she was dating anyone, and then she told us about him. He was this exchange student from moscow (although he had told us he had lived in Slovakia for awhile) I was very indifferent on him at first, but as I got to know him a little better he turned out to be what I had hoped my daughter would go after. He treated her right and was a good natured young man, which is all I cared about. 

My wife was skeptical of him the whole time. Now that our daughter has come to us about a week ago or so and told us that she is planning on moving back with him (now that his time is almost up) AND that they are getting married, she is beginning to lose her damn mind. She had sat us down and talked to us about the whole situation, saying that she really *really* liked this guy and wanted to continue their relationship, even if that meant going elsewhere with him. 

Her main goal has always seemed to be getting out of here and traveling. She is obsessed with Europe/Asia and basically anyplace that's not here, and this seems to be her golden chance. She's told us since she was young that her main aspiration was moving out the country, but I guess I never really thought it would actually happen. Marriage would help her with making citizenship go a little smoother, and with her gaining temporary residency as she's told us. 

They had brought in documents and paperwork that they had printed off to show us it was really serious, and are just planning to privately get married (no big wedding) and leave when its time. The boys parents are suppose to be coming to meet us sometime next year as well. 

I just want my daughter to be happy. But this is such a big thing. I never expected that she would make such a decision like this, all this quickly. I'm terrified at the idea of her moving halfway across the world, where I won't he able to be there if anything shall happen. I trust her ""fiancé"", but I also feel a bit upset that he's taking her so far away from me, as selfish as that may sound.

My wife has been handling it a lot worse than I have. She's been a wreck. Crying, trying to bribe our daughter not to go (offering her money), and was even becoming physically violent toward her boyfriend a few times. The way she's been acting is actually a little frightening, I have never really seen her act so desprete. I understand where she's coming from, but how can I get her to calm down about this situation a bit? I guess some advice for the both if us on how to support our daughter more and push aside our own personal feelings would be helpful...

"My [M 20] mom [37 F] is trying to steal my boyfriend [M 21].


Made a throwaway for this as my boyfriend uses Reddit. Apologies if this sounds disjointed or rambling.
 
To start this off, my mom has been in and out of my life since I was born. She was very immature and irresponsible when I was younger so I was mostly raised by my aunt (her older sister) and uncle. About 6 years ago she decided to buckle down and have me live with her full time for the first time, ever, really. 

Things were okay at first. But she's still very immature for a parent. She dates and sleeps around a lot. For example, I have two younger sisters and a younger brother, only one of which lives here with us. This has been a serious source of tension between us for almost the entire time I've been here.. 

Anyway, about 2 years ago I came out as gay, which my mom was fine with. She actually encouraged me to try to look for guys to bring home even when I still in high school. I've had a few boyfriends, but I didn't bring most of them around home. My most recent boyfriend, who I'll call N, has only been with me for a couple months now. But a few weeks ago I decided to ""take the plunge"" and invite him over to my place. I thought things went well, my mom was very friendly and asking N a ton of questions. But something seemed a bit off.. Like one of the first things she asked him was about his sexuality. N is bi, but prefers men, and I thought that was a very strange question for her to ask.

Since then, N has been over at my house several times. Almost every weekend and sometimes Friday nights as well. Every time, my mom will chat him up like crazy. Sometimes to the point where I have to pull him into another room to get some time with him for myself. Most of the time it seems like pretty innocent chat, but once after coming from the bathroom I caught them laughing with my mom poking N's cheek/dimple. Again, very weird behavior to me. 

Last night I came home, my mom was acting kind of weirder than normal. She was bubbly and happy and talking about how she was getting so many texts. When I asked her who they were from she listed a couple of people and then said N. I asked her when she had exchanged numbers with N and she said something like ""Oh just one of the times he was here"". 

I've texted N a few times today, but we won't see each other in person again until Monday. This is seriously bothering me though. I know N is bi, but he's always told me he prefers men and has never really dated a woman. Much less one as old as my mother. I'm very convinced that she's strongly coming onto him though, and he's either going along with it or is wanting it in return. I'm not too sure what to do now. I'm considering confronting N, but it could end up making me look like a crazy jealous control-freak of a boyfriend. Anyone have any suggestions?

"My (24F) brother (28m) tried to make amends with me and I ignored him. He died this weekend, how do I forgive myself?


My brother and I have had a rough relationship for the last ten years. My brother struggled with addiction since I was about 14 years old. Around two years ago I stopped speaking to him. I would not talk to him at holidays, I would ignore his text messages, I just would not speak to him.



He stole all my money one summer and it was the final straw. He would steal from my parents, he would lie, and he was never sober. I could not stand to be around it anymore. He begged me for a second chance multiple times. This past monday he congratulated me on an accomplishment, I did not respond. He said he had been sober for 145 days. I did not believe him. His last message to me is saying ""I was kind of hoping you would talk to me a little"" I did not know that he had been in jail for the last 5 months, but he really was sober for that period of time. 



I had a feeling that I should respond to this.. but by the time I was actually getting around to responding and talking to him was already dead. 



I can't forgive myself. I know logically that he was still doing drugs. He died of an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl. I can't help but think maybe if I had responded this time he would have been more hopeful and stayed sober. I don't know what to do. I thought about texting his phone just to get out my feelings and tell him I love him one last time, but his phone is at the police department and some agent may read the message.



I don't know how to process my grief. I wish I had replied. I wish I had one last good memory with him. 




TL:DR I ignored my brother trying to apologize to me and he died. I can't forgive myself. "
"Me [25 F] with my husband [24 M] 2 years, tonight today I realised I need to leave him but his parents are arriving tonight to stay for 2 weeks!


So I am not sure what I want from this post except some advice and confirmation I am making the right choice.

my husband and I have had a rocky and whirlwind marriage. We married 2 months after meeting each other as I found out I was pregnant after the first month of dating. I learnt pretty early on he was a liar and kept from me that his boss didn't pay him. When I found out he was sorry to keep the lie but didn't want to worry me. So we got joint bank accounts and he promised to be honest.
a month after our child was born he decided to quit his job and start a business with his friend behind my back. He used our joint savings of $10 000 to do fund half the expenses without telling me.

when I found out I was angry but I believed in him and his business. After a year the business failed and we struggled as he couldn't admit it was failing
I later found out just this year that he had taken multiple credit card loans that totals to $20 000 in deb we cannot pay this debt off and survive. He now has a full time job but the hours are insane and he is unable to do anything except work. All other duties and responsibilities fall on me and this can be daunting when living with such an irresponsible person.  There are just some things I can't do for him and therefore they never get done.

he also has a problem with alcohol.  Whenever he starts its hard for him to stop and after 3 beers he is a very nasty drunk. He has spat on me, screamed in my face, yelled at me while I held our child which frightened them, and smashed up furniture and doors (also does this when not drunk but angry).

But the worst of all this was yesterday and today.
Yesterday he did a monster shift of around 35 hours straight
 He came home in the morning and drank 3 beers but needed cigarettes.  He asked me to get them for him and I thought I should so he doesn't drink and drive. Our young child, 2 years old, was safe in their cot watching tv and the store was 1 min drive away. So I left but my husband locked the door from the inside and left the keys in. Therefore when I got back I couldn't unlock the front door
So I went to the back door but the top bolt was locked inside so I couldn't get in. I knocked and rang his phone but no answer. I went to the back sliding door which faces into the lounge and saw my husband asleep on the couch and my child no longer in the cot!

I freaked out and after trying everything I broke the front door window to get in as I was so scared my child was in danger. I found my child in our room luckily safe. ANYTHING could have happened to them! I was pumping with relief, anger and adrenaline and woke my husband up yelling at him for my child being out the cot and me locked out and how I had to break the window to get in. My hand was bleeding
 He got up said I was lying and we were over and threw our xmas tree on the floor. He went into a rant for an hour saying I was a liar and I broke the window on purpose. 

We talked it all over later and I agreed my behaviour towards him is cruel as I always snap at him and bring up the past. He agreed his temper is shameful and he needs to try and be calm and just walk away. He said he took our child out to play and then didn't realise he fell asleep

I shouldn't of left our child with him but I thought he was safe in his cot for 10 mins while dad sat on couch. I had no idea he would take our child out of the cot.

anyway skip to today and he is meant to be helping me by getting rid of a cupboard that is all smashed up before his parents arrive and picking up a bed for his parents to sleep on and outting the bes together. 
He told me he had a work lunch near our house at a bar. It started at 4.30 but at 6pm I needed him to get home and help me and pick up the be d as his car has the room to take it home. Instead I get told he isn't going to and I should buy it and he will send a courier to get it
 By the time I grabbed some necessities from the shop there is 40 mins before the furniture store closes
He refuses to come and help me. I try to get the sofa bed in my car but it doesn't fit so he eventually drives to the store in a bad mood and over the limit, throws the sofa bed in his car and speeds off. When I get home he isn't there. He is back at the pub. 

I am really hurt because we have to leave in 3 hours to pick up his parents! He will be over the drinking limit if he drives. But he will probably just come home and fall asleep. This is going to mean I will have to go and pick them up. Its a long drive and I'm not confident driving at night. Also they will be mad at hime of they get a whiff of what has been going on and will be quite hurt to know he hasn't even made them a bed to sleep on. 

I am so angry and hurt his level of disrespect is shocking and I know I have to leave. We have a child together and he is on a marriage visa to stay here.  He is also very threatening about if I leave our child stays with him. 

I am expected to entertain and drive his parents around for 2 weeks and host a family xmas dinner at mine. I am so sad I wish I could just crawl into a hole. I feel like I have to paint on a smile so I don't ruin his parents holiday and xmas for everyone.

what should I do?
