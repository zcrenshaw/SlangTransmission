"I'm (28F) not sure if what mt therapist (30sM) said to me is creepy and inappropriate


So I started seeing my therapist a few months ago and after the first session I decided I liked him and felt like I could trust him. We've recently been doing some work on my lack of assertiveness/ inability to call people out if they upset me because I'm scared of hurting their feelings.

I can't exactly remember how the conversation went but he suddenly said ""can I be honest with you? And I hope you trust me enough to listen and not take this personally but from the moment I met you I could tell you were very vulnerable. I knew that if I wanted something more from you than a working relationship, I could have had it. You're in a vulnerable position here, I'm a man who's stronger than you and I could see your vulnerability, I knew you wouldn't say no""

First of all this pissed me off because obviously I would say no, I'm engaged and also am not about to fuck my therapist regardless of my situation. Second of all I found it really creepy and unprofessional. I get the point he was trying to make, I just don't understand why he had to use that theoretical situation. 
Third of all, why the hell was he wondering whether he thinks he could take advantage of me or not in our first session?

Another important point is that I was raped in the past and he is fully aware of this. He brought it up and said ""I can see how it happened, you didn't give him the right signals that you didn't want to have sex with him. By the way I'm in no way suggesting that it was your fault"" I couldn't help but think that he totally was suggesting that and it really upset me. Also, that's not even true- my rapist was fully aware I did not want to sleep with him. I can't stop thinking about it but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. Maybe I just didn't want to hear what he said so I'm thinking he's wrong to say those things when in actual fact he's just doing his job?

He's said other slightly weird things in the past that I've let go and assumed I was being oversensitive but I can't stop thinking about this.

TL:DR Therapist basically said he felt like he could fuck me if he wanted and I probably wouldn't say no. Went on to hint that my rape was my fault. Do I sack him off?"

"My girlfriend [23F] checks my [27M] phone, asks to get engaged almost daily.


Hi Reddit/r

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. 

She asked me out during my last year of college and things went from there. I will say that during the first month to 6 weeks she became attached very fast. I'm talking light your brains on fire sex every single day and her telling me how much she loves me.

fast forward 2 years and there is absolutely no sex, no foreplay, nothing.

It has been this way for 6 or 7 months. She suddenly wants to wait until we get married. She asks if I am going to propose almost every day. ""When are you going to propose? Did you buy a ring? Why haven't you proposed yet?""

No, I have not gotten a ring. Her constant talk of marriage makes me uncomfortable. 

But also, she checks my phone a lot. Any female friend I have (not many as she is extremely jealous) gets me 20 questions. Whether they're snap chats, work texts or if I see someone in public, I get grilled.

I notice that I receive snaps and they're already opened so I miss them. She looks over my shoulder when I text or asks every time who I am texting. It's pretty crappy.

Here's the other side to this coin...

She has TONS of guy friends. Orbiters if you will. A bunch of single blokes who constantly snapchat, message or call. Does it bother me? not really. The double standard bothers me more.

She flipped out on me for having a conversation with an old friend (girl-in a 6 year relationship) from college last week and took my phone and began to type a rude message. I managed to get my phone back before she pressed send.

But I notice that when she texts, she turns he body so that I would have no chance to see the screen. Specifically, she just met this new dude and I know she's messaging him (she told me) as a new friend. Yeah... 

Honestly, I don't trust her anymore because I feel that she does not trust me or herself.

There's more to the story... but you get the idea.


I DONT CHECK HER PHONE.

But her behavior is throwing up a bunch of red flags.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF checks my phone, wants to get married. I don't think that is wise. Thoughts?"
"My [24F] friends [22-24F] have stopped inviting me to hang out with them. We have a group trip coming up and now I'm not sure if I should go.


My group of ""friends"" has basically stopped inviting me every time they all hang out together. The last few times I was actually invited was to more planned events like the ""friendsgiving"" we did around Thanksgiving and a Yankee swap around Christmas time. Other than that, they all hang out every weekend (they post snapchats and Instagrams together) and I never get the invite anymore. 

Recently one of the girls texted me ""I miss you!!"" and I took that as an opportunity to point out the fact that, well, if you miss me then you haven't really been making an effort to hang out with me. I gave a specific example like ""on Sunday I noticed that you were all together and I wasn't included, so I'm not really sure what to do since I'm not getting invited to anything you guys do anymore."" Something along those lines.

Her excuse was ""I'm soo sorry I woke up drunk and then kept drinking all day, that's my bad.""

Well, okay, but that's a super shitty excuse. ""I was drunk"" doesn't really excuse ANY type of behavior. It also doesn't explain at all why I've been excluded from everything else as well. I let it go because I don't want to dig my own grave by starting an argument about it. 

I think it's important to mention that I'm the only one in the group with a serious boyfriend, and I think that is probably the main root of this issue. However I would always make time for my friends if they would just invite me, so... I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It's not like I'm getting invited and then decline all the time to hang out with my boyfriend. Back when I was still getting included (few months ago), I made time for them every single weekend and it was a lot of fun. I honestly don't know what has changed since then. I have invited them to do things with me and they all give some kind of ""sorry I'm doing something else, but have so much fun girl!!!"" excuse.

So now after weeks of being excluded 95% of the time, we are coming up on a weekend trip to [insert city here]. This is something we all booked MONTHS ago because we got a good deal, and I was obviously still being included back then. 

I texted our group chat trying to make plans in [city] and I swear to you nobody responded or wrote anything in that group chat for an entire week. At that point I took the hint and backed off. 

But now I just don't know if I should even go. The trip is in 4 days and these girls obviously don't want to be around me for some reason. I'm just thinking, why put the effort in with this group if they aren't returning that effort at all? Why go spend a ton of money in [city] with these seemingly fake friends? Why go put myself in a situation where I'm stuck with people who apparently don't even want me to be there? I have invested about $150 for this trip so far and I'm ready to just accept the loss for that.

At the same time, I don't want to alienate myself from the group and give them even MORE of a reason to keep excluding me. But I'm kind of over these people. They have made it clear that they don't see me as a friend. It feels like I'm in high school again and I'm starting to think that I should just move on from these girls.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? Should I suck it up and go on the trip? Should I bail for a seemingly innocent reason (oh I couldn't get work off), or should I bail and let them know why (you guys are shitty friends)?

Thanks in advance for your help. It feels really shitty to be excluded like this for seemingly no reason, and I just want to hear an outside perspective.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Friends recently stopped inviting me to hang out with them, and I don't know why. We have a trip coming up this weekend (that was booked months ago), but now that I'm being deliberately excluded from the group I'm having a hard time deciding whether I should even go anymore. Do I go or not? Do I confront the group or just move on?

  ---   
  **EDIT**: So I've been busy at work all day and this got a lot more comments than I expected, but THANK YOU everyone for replying. I'm reading through everything. I guess this is a pretty common scenario. The two main responses seem to either be ""drop them, don't go, they aren't worth it"" or ""are you really making enough effort to be their friend, invite them, find out what's going on, etc?"" This made me think that hey, maybe I really haven't been making enough of an effort because I've been feeling down that they haven't either.

I still have some time to decide, but right now I'm leaning toward going on the trip to make just ONE more effort with this group. We do always have fun when we're together. I've already put money toward the trip so why not just go? If we become just ""fair weather friends"" afterward, that's okay with me. We basically already are anyway. But I am afraid that me bailing on this trip will genuinely be the end of these friendships. Is going a bad idea? Am I letting the fear of being friendless/alone cause me to make a bad decision? Can you tell how indecisive and back-and-forth on this issue I have been? Lol. Thank you again everyone. 

  ---   
  **EDIT 2**: I just checked snapchat to find out that everyone bought tickets to see [insert comedian here] next month and they're ""SOOO EXCITED!!"" Didn't get any sort of invite on that one either. Lol. I'm starting to get the picture. However, I'm going to keep my head high, remain friendly with everyone, go on the trip and try to have a good time. After that, I don't care what happens next. I'd rather take the high road than confront everyone, start drama, and stir up a ton of shit for no reason. They're not worth it and I see that now, but backing out of the trip would cause more trouble than it's worth. I think."

**Edit for Update** 

Let him go as nicely as possible. His sister has been blowing my phone up all day with invectives and nasty slams telling me her brother is so amazing. I messaged her back that she should have married him if she was so smitten with him. Then blocked her.

He messaged me after I specifically said not to so I told him messaging me after I told him not to is NOT respectful, so he is not being respectful, and that makes him a not nice guy, do NOT message me again.

He complied, but I blocked him after work anyway.

Thank goodness he doesnt know where I live.

I give up on dating for a while. Maybe a nice vacation to somewhere that serves lobster would be a better use of my time.

---Original---

I've been talking to this guy for a few months and am getting increasingly creeped out by him.  My friends and family insist I am being judgmental and mean.

He constantly talks about how much he loves his sister, her husband, his brothers, and their kids (he sent me a picture of the kids the first day he texted me. I reacted poorly to that. Not his kids, should not be sending strangers their photos, what the hell!) 

Any difference of opinion we have is met with ""I respect you I respect that you have a point of view I am a very respectful guy I am a nice guy. I am a really nice guy, everyone thinks I am a nice guy."" Unless it's about church, then he tells me there is no excuse to not go. 

He monologues every time we talk on the phone, often times interrupting me or cutting me off after asking me a question, all while talking as fast as possible. We have had the same conversation every time he calls (him telling me inappropriately personal things for our acquantance, like vivid detail of family members deaths). I have told him this, and he immediately interrupts with the ""I respect you,"" spiel, again as fast as possible. Then goes right back to what I objected to and restarts the story. I have hung up on him several times for this already.

He always talks at lightning speed and in the rare times I can get a word in edgewise, no acknowledgement of me having said anything happens. He bulldozes on, jumping subject to subject again speaking extremely fast.

The most annoying part was him telling me ""My sister said I should tell you you are beautiful. You are really beautiful, beautiful."" I flatly told him that he was insincere and to not call me beautiful if he didnt mean it, and to address me by my name.  He lapsed into the I respect you,"" speech again.

I dont know if he has some kind of disability, or if he's just plain insane. Some things he does are similar to my autistic sister, some are similar to people I know with adult ADHD. Then again some are just batshit insane.

*Edit to add*
Every day he texts me morning, noon, and night to have a good day, he hopes work is going well, and he hopes work went well, and that he is praying for me. I dont even text my mother that much. It feels very much like forced intimacy and I tell him to text less.

My friends are insisting I am cruel for not wanting to give him a chance, because he's very good looking.

I think I should run for the hills and cancel the date (that he asked me out on, but I have to plan. Because he likes everything I like and wants to do anything I want to do.)

Good people of the internet, should I put my good running kicks on, or is he exhibiting a disorder I should be sensitive about and work with?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: He rambles nonstop about the same things, tells me I'm pretty when his sister tells him he should,  reiterates constantly that he's a respectful and nice guy, speaks at a super fast pace jumping subjects constantly, etc....and I am getting increasingly creeped out by it all, but he may have a disorder I am not aware of."

____________________________________________________
Hi again, Reddit! I just wanted to thank you all for the amazing comments (excluding those who told me that they had obviously slept together/were still together despite knowing nothing outside the context of the post). For the most part, the advice I got was extremely helpful, and it helped me work through a lot of things.

It's been two and half months, so I'm not totally 'over it,' but I'm healing. My husband did something stupid and hurtful, and I did consider leaving him, but ever since this happened he's done everything in his power to make me feel cared for and appreciated. He's genuinely remorseful, and in my eyes, he's earned a second chance. We've also just started couple's counseling, and that is going well so far.

For the first few weeks after he confessed, we didn't have sex. Even being naked in front of him felt wrong, since I was not only angry but constantly comparing myself to this woman. Neither of us is the type to give up, though, we each took a week off of work to have a little 'staycation'. At the end of it, we decided, we would know if we were going to stay together or break up.

It was amazing. We caught up on Game of Thrones, lounged around and ate pizza in our underwear, and got drunk off of wine. We talked (a LOT), we cried, and in the end I do think we managed to come out of it in a healthy place. On our last day off, we went to the same restaurant where he took the other woman on a date. At the table, we did a silly little ceremony to re-christen it as a place for us, where her presence doesn't matter. And you know what? It doesn't matter as much any more. She doesn't mean anything to us (he was eager to block her on everything and lets me look through his phone, though I haven't been doing it lately because privacy and all that).

Not to be too TMI, but we're having sex again, better than it was before we reconnected like this. I feel like we've regained a spark that we haven't felt in a while.

I still think about the other woman sometimes, but I'm not obsessive like I used to be. She may have seemed perfect to me, but I don't know her, and there are a million little flaws and quirks that I never got to witness. My husband has been with me for 12 years, and I just have to keep reminding myself that he still chose me.

tldr: Generally happy update! I'm healing, my relationship is bouncing back stronger than ever, and we're in therapy. I don't obsess over his fling as much as I used to, and hopefully it'll only get better with time."

"[UPDATE] I (17/M) elbowed a female friend (17/F) of mine on Monday and now she's avoiding me.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5q7inv/i_17m_elbowed_a_female_friend_17f_of_mine_on/)

Coincidentally enough, the girl, Julie, ended up texting me back before my mom had the chance to talk to her mom. The text I sent her on the day of the incident was, ""Hey, I'm really, really sorry for what happened back there. I hope you're okay,"" and she texted me back late last night saying, ""I'm fine. I heard you switched lockers with Gia. You didn't have to do that."" I replied asking, ""It was best to switch though, wasn't it?"" And she answered, ""No. You're fine, OP. Stop."" I wasn't really sure what to say to that other than, ""So you're not scared of me?"" and she said, ""Of course not. I was never scared. I needed a few days to process. That's all. Plus I'm pretty sure I flashed you when I fell. That was so embarrassing."" I immediately said, ""I didn't see anything. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. It was my fault."" 

After that we continued texting for a bit. She ended up talking to her mom on her own, and then we walked to home room together today. According to her she avoided me because she thought I saw something. But I didn't. Seriously. She said we're cool, and our moms had a chat, came to the conclusion that we're okay, just shaken up for different reasons. Regardless, I'm still going to talk to my hockey coach about how to control reflexes off the ice. Julie said she's fine but I don't want to risk anything like that happening again. 

(EDIT: *Someone told me to add this comment of mine in the post*. In my mind I lost all sense and gave her a hard elbow on reflex, realizing it was *her* when it was too late, but according to her I sorta just nudged her when I spun around and she lost balance from that. In reality what happened was probably somewhere in the middle. Those people were (rightfully) reacting under the impression that Julie was scared/traumatized, which she easily could have been. Regardless, I should work on my reflexes.)

TL;DR - She texted me back late last night, before our moms had the chance to speak, and she told me she's fine, and that she had avoided me for a few days because she was embarrassed. Apparently she flashed me when she fell. I have no memory of that. I didn't see anything. I told her as much. We're cool now. That said I'm still going to talk to my coach about how to control my reflexes off the ice. "
"[Update] Me [20/F] in love with a guy [21/M] but I'm embarrassed to introduce him to my family

So, I first wanted to thank everyone for their kind and supportive comments. On the drive from school to my place, we were talking and I brought up the subject of wealth and the differences between the middle class and the wealthy, such as lifestyle, etc. He knew I was going somewhere with it, so I flat-out told him. Yeah, I could have been more delicate. 

He was really hurt, and said that he's not sure why I would feel that way but that he certainly would not hold anyone's wealth (or lack of it) against them. Families are families and that's what is important. I realized I that a lot of this was in my own head which made me feel like a real butthole. 

We stopped at my home and my parents, sister &amp; brother met him. My brother, who is 16 asked if he owned a Ferrari and/or could he buy one. Carl laughed it off and said he was banned from owning Ferrari after leaving a chocolate bar in the glove box. I was really impressed with how well he handled himself and impressed that he knows/understands more Spanish than he lets on. 

He went home and my family sat around playing cards. I told my parents how relieved I was that things went well and they asked why. Again, I should learn to clamp my mouth. I told them I was worried about the disparity in wealth, etc. They were a little hurt, but fortunately, my big mouthed sister said that Carl was slumming it. That took the attention off me and onto her. 

Saturday, Carl came over at noon, brought a gift (which was really sweet and well-received) and we had a *great* time. My abuela, my aunts &amp; uncles all think he's really great. My parents like that he's grounded, smart and driven. My abuela loved that he loves to eat. She fed him a lot of everything, so much so that he wound-up laying on the floor to digest. Everyone thought he is really nice and that we make a great pair. 

My sister.... you were all right, it's a jealousy thing. She kept trying to intimate that it must be hard to be at poor people's houses and that being with all these Mexicans must be really scary. When I'd hug him or cuddle-up with him, she'd get passive-aggressive and make comments about how I was no longer pure (my sister is one to talk), suggested that he could do better and told him about the time I poured water on her painting (I was 2...). She got upset when my brother showed interest in Carl, both bonded over a love of cars. My sister was a nuisance the entire day and eventually left. 

She came home later on, and to her credit, she apologized. She said she was angry that she's older than I am, but still single and that I had met someone who made me happy and seemed to be a really earnest and nice guy. We had a nice chat and she sincerely apologized. She seems to like Carl but was upset and you guys immediately picked-up on that. 

All-in-all, it went really well. I was so happy at the end of the evening that I gave him a kiss and told him I loved him, and he immediately told me he loved me. It was fantastic! Driving back soon and I feel really fortunate and wanted to thank you for giving me the right advice. Doing what I wanted to would have just been rude/idiotic and I shouldn't let my neuroses, or other people's problems, get in my way.

  **tl;dr**: Went much better than planned and everyone really liked Carl. Wealth/Race was hardly an issue; learned that Carl speaks/understands more Spanish than he lets on and we exchanged ""I Love you""s for the first time!"

"Me [26F] with my boyfriend [29M] of two years - he suddenly announced he hates my cat and wants him gone - I'm considering going with the cat


Hey there, using a throwaway because boyfriend knows my reddit username. Sorry if this is all over the place but I'm very upset.

I have been together with my boyfriend for 2 years and we moved in together 6 months ago. He is the love of my life, or I thought so, and I gave up so much to be with him here. I've had my cat for 5 years, not to sound like a crazy cat lady but I'm not close to my family and I only have maybe 2 friends who don't live in close proximity, so my cat is my ""family"", or has been at least my stable point in those years I had him. He knew we were a package and while we were not exactly pressured to move in together (despite being long distance), he asked me to move in with him. Boyfriend met my cat beforehand multiple times and he seemed to love him, and I must say, I have never seen my cat connect with any person like he did with my boyfriend. He used to cuddle me but since my boyfriend is nearby all the time, he completely ditched me! As far as I was concerned, it was a perfect match and I couldn't have been happier with how well the two most important people in my life got along. My boyfriend loved him so much that at some point he tried to convince me to get a second kitten as his own so my cat has company, but in the end we decided against it for multiple reasons.

Our flat is not too big and divided into rooms in a very poor way, which means we have no real way of closing the cat out of the bedroom. This hasn't been a problem until a couple days ago. My cat ate something he shouldn't have and has had an upset stomach since, so he has been complaining more than usual (but otherwise he sleeps about 20 hours a day so I wouldn't say he is a bother... either way a visit to the vet is due today). I'm a light sleeper so I wake up probably twice a night to the cat just walking around but my boyfriend never did until the cat became restless a few days ago.

He has never had a pet of his own before but he is a big animal lover. Unfortunately in light of our latest talk I realised that he is one of those people who love other people's animals/kids because he only has to deal with them for a limited time but otherwise absolutely hate the responsibility and the ugly parts that come with actually owning one. In retrospect I witnessed this about a year ago when we looked after his sister's dog for about 3 months. He claims he is a dog person (this was one of his defenses for why he hates my cat??) but after a week or two he was annoyed with the dog too even though it's a very good doggo.

So yesterday he sat me down and told me out of the blue, without much explanation that he hates my cat because he is annoying, stinky and he doesn't feel safe around him or leaving him in the flat. I think this is a bunch of bullshit and related to my cat being unwell and needing more attention in the past few days, because otherwise he is very low maintenance. But to address his new-found concerns:

- annoying: he will do ""cat"" things for maybe 30 minutes a day. Running around before pooping, meowing for attention and food, etc. He's also worried that the meowing and running around bothers our neighbours and they will report us to the building management.

- stinky: I do my best to keep his litter and the area clean, unfortunately the past week I didn't sweep in the kitchen every time he went to the toilet. I'm working two jobs and was just exhausted this past week. I always tried to do anything related to the cat on my own and not expecting help from him because even at the start I knew that essentially this is my pet I need to take care of. So he complained that there was some fine litter on the floor and how he now has to walk around knee deep in cat piss.

- not safe: my cat has NEVER bit, scratched or attacked my boyfriend in any form. He will nibble me if I ignore him too long and he needs something but nothing vicious. He admitted that he has no reason to feel unsafe but he does because it's a cat.

- the flat: technically my cat shouldn't be in this flat so this is a valid point. We got the blessing of the girl who normally lives in the flat and her mother who rents the flat to us, but the flat is owned by her husband. He wrote the lease and it very clearly says ""no pets allowed"", although we were advised to just bring him in anyway. But I do realise this leaves us no legal standpoint if it comes to defending having the cat in the flat. Unfortunately we didn't really have a choice at that time other than moving the cat in. He also complains because my cat lightly scratched the sofa before I taught him not to. It's barely noticeable but I already offered to replace it when we move out, should it be a problem.


So yeah. He told me he hates the cat and wishes he was gone. He also told me he won't throw out either of us and won't ask me to get rid of him, but he wants nothing to do with him from now on (he couldn't explain what he had to do so far apart from my cat wanting to sit in his lap every morning, something he refused to let him do in the past days). Honestly, I don't want to keep the cat somewhere where I know someone hates him, and not because I think my boyfriend would treat him badly. This incident was very eye-opening for me, because now I also think I can't stay with someone I won't be able to have more pets with. My options are either moving my cat to my ex (who very much loves him, we got the cat together) but I know I'd be heartbroken without him, I already am. Or I just break up with my boyfriend over this and move out with my cat after I figure out where we should go next. But I have no idea, I feel like it would be crazy to leave an otherwise good relationship over ""just a cat"", but my heart is breaking if I think about having to give him and possible future pets up.



To get ahead of an obvious suggestion: I moved here to be with him from another country and the flat market here is CRAZY, so I can't really just move out and find a flat on my own around here. We have been looking for a flat for the better part of those two years before we got this one, and on my own, as a foreigner, with a cat, I stand no chance.

"Me [24 M] with my sister [17/F] duration, She shared private info out of malice


some backstory. First, my sister is staying with me because her mom is a mess and our dad is abusive. I basically just feed her and let her crash on my couch. She still spends time with her mom but if i didn't feed her and give her a quiet place to sleep not haunted by her mom she'd be a malnourished wreck. I feel responsible for her well being.

Second, I spend a lot of time writing very explicit material. Detail isn't necessary here, i think, but just know it's pornographic and far from vanilla. I've never shared it with anyone. 

We got in a disagreement over her mess in the bathroom/kitchen. I basically told her to clean after herself and threatened to ground her. 

Today at work my phone is blowing up, but i ignore it because i work for assholes who go apeshit if they see a phone. it's a bunch of her friends making fun of me. She had apparently skipped school, got on my computer, and shared the explicit material out of spite. it's on my desktop and i name the files very specifically so I'm not surprised she found them, but I'm not sure why she was on my computer in the first place. 

I got home and told her to go to her mom's place. I also deleted Facebook because I honestly don't use it and can't be fucked. I'm seriously considering just kicking her out for good. 17 is to old for that kind of extreme lashing out over such a petty issue, so i have to take it personally. The malice behind the act bothers me more than the act. 

Am I being to harsh?

"Me [26 F] with my husband [24 M] of two years. He just exhausts me.


I'd like input as to whether I am feeling this way because I am currently very sick, or if my feelings are valid.

A few days ago I went to the ER because I had a uncontrolled high fever, body pain, infrequent urination and tremors. Turns out I have a kidney infection.

Anyway, the issue is my husband. He is a paramedic. He is also very self-confident in his abilities. It has gotten to the point where I don't want him in the room when the doctor comes in! (I haven't said this to anyone though). My doctor is a PA (actually he keeps telling me ""shes not a doctor"") and a female. He has pointed out several times while we were here that he hasn't seen any males working at this hospital. We've literally seen the same like, 4 people the whole time we've been here.

I am just exhausted for making excuses for his sexist, demeaning remarks. Such as when the doctor (whoops- PA) asked me what medications I had taken, he interrupted and said a certain amount of Tylenol. She didn't agree that the amount he said was correct, and the REST OF THE NIGHT he googled articles about how that WAS the correct dosage. Even after it was like, over and done with.

I am very tired, and in pain. I am just wondering if I am being an emotional, hurt wreck. Or if his behavior is concerning?

"UPDATE My [27/F] boyfriend's [28/M] snoring is killing our relationship


Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jakjm/my_27f_boyfriends_28m_snoring_is_killing_our/)

Thanks to everyone who took the time to reply and the awesome people who messaged me about their personal stories and gave me some great advice.

To the negative commenters...well, my man is still awesome so sorry you didn't get the ""break up, hit the gym"" scenario you wanted.

To start off, I talked to my boyfriend about his drinking. He completely agreed and he realized he was getting out of hand as well. We both promised to try and keep each other on a healthier path for eating and drinking and so far we're doing great. His drinking has definitely gone down and he realized he was sleeping a bit better but not 100%.

We decided then to contact someone we know who has ties to the medical community in the country we're currently living in. He provided us with information and set us up an appointment with a sleep specialist. After a couple of days in the hospital and some testing, we found out that he does have sleep apnea. We got a mask for him and everything has been fantastic! He feels better in the morning, I feel better for being well rested, and we both feel better that he's breathing regularly in his sleep.

Everything is great again. Communication and understanding is key. Thanks again."
"(UPDATE) Me [25 M] with my roommate's [27 M] dog, keeps pooping in the house during the day


Hey everyone, [I posted a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ruqr2/me_25_m_with_my_roommates_27_m_dog_keeps_pooping/) about my roommate's dog who kept pooping in the house and I just wanted to update for everyone who commented.

Kyle and I wound up moving out a couple months ago partly because of the dog issues and partly because Chris' girlfriend found a job in our city and was going to move in with him. After we moved out, Fido continued to have the same issues. It peaked when he peed on the floor, it leaked through the floor and started dripping through a potlight in our ground floor neighbour's apartment. After that Chris was kind of at his wit's end, so he decided to bite the bullet and get an MRI for Fido.

Turns out Fido has a massive brain tumour that's completely inoperable and he has to be put down. Chris is understandably a mess (and so are Kyle and I to a lesser degree) so we've been trying our best to help out as much as we can. We're going over tonight for one last visit with Fido before he gets put down tomorrow.

Sorry it's not a very happy update, but I think in the long run it's probably for the best so Fido doesn't have to suffer and Chris doesn't have to keep getting stressed about his stuff getting destroyed. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on the initial post.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5otgaj/me_29_m_with_my31_m_6_month_boyfriend_who_isnt/)

Soooo on Sunday i found out my boyfriend had blocked me on facebook. I was able to still send him messages through FB messenger where he has a pretty new picture of he and his new girlfriend up. I was physically ill. Didn't sleep. Wanted to die very badly, but I made it. 

Moving on, I sent him a message that said I wanted my cat back and my money I loaned him to get presents for the kids. (just $100) He sent me a message that said I could come get the cat when the two kids were home so that I could explain to them i was taking it back. I ultimately said they could keep it because the kids loved it and i don't want to hurt them.

He then agrees to meet me and talk. I ask when. He answers:
""I work tomorrow but maybe tuesday after you get out of school. &lt;BradyLeeG&gt; it isn't you. You are amazing in every way possible.

I said well then you need to talk to me. Tuesday comes and he says it will have to be Thursday because his ex-wife is moving her stuff into his grandmas house, at the bottom of his driveway, because she just left her boyfriend and has no where to go and he will not allow her to stay at his house. 

I said it needs to happen today because im a wreck, my lifes been on hold for 10 days. I told him I had a lot i needed to say and that he needed to say some things to me. His response:

""Theres not a whole lot for me to say. I can't be in a relationship with another guy. I'm sorry. I thought it was what i wanted but it isn't. I do really like you and I really care about you. Over the past few months you ahve grown to become my best friend and I don't want to lose you as a friend, if you think that is possible. But I just can't be with you and I'm sorry."" 


So yeah. If you didn't check out the OP, he used to cheat on his wife all the time. Sleeping with another married guy, offering hot guys on FB blowjobs and then when the guys would decline, he'd always say someone took his phone and sent that. 

My thoughts: He is sexually attracted to guys, but cannot be with a guy for whatever reason. He's not out. He's afraid. He's a fucking liar. 

Anyways I thought i'd update anyone who read the original. Give me your thoughts. I need to be strong when I talk to him tomorrow unless he blows me off again. In which case, I'll get my closure by showing up to his station in front of all the other paramedics. "

"A stranger on the internet [34M] messaged me [18F] to let me know that my boyfriend [19M] and I are ""all over"" a couple's swapping site.


Throwaway because all of my friends know my main. And I'm sorry if the grammar in this post is all over the place, it's late here and I'm kind of freaking out. For the sake of privacy I'm going to call my bf ""Ryan"" and the guy who messaged me ""Craig."" 

**Background** : Been with Ryan for six months, the relationship is fun and great.


Now let's just get straight to it.


I was browsing social media before bed when facebook alerted me that a non-friend was requesting to send me a message. Curious, I opened it and was greeted with a shock. He stopped replying after my second question.

Craig: Soooooo umm heard that you two are into couple swapping... Etc. Lol

Me: What?

Craig: Y'all are all over a site for that. Not trying to be a creep at all or odd about it. This would be our first time doing anything like that.

Me: Can you send me screenshots of that stuff? Sorry if I sound rude. I don't think you're creepy, it's just that as far as I know my partner and I aren't on any sites for swapping or anything else sexual.



Ryan isn't picking up his phone (it's late). I think that someone might have taken our images and put them on some sort of sexual meet up website (and I have no clue what the ""Etc"" entailed.) And since we were contacted by a man in his 30s the site must say that we're older than the 18/19 year old kids we are. I'm also scared because Craig's profile says that he is from the same city that Ryan and I are from, so whatever site we're on has our relative location on it. Maybe Ryan has something to do with it? 

 I want to know how I should proceed from here. Please help. 





UPDATE: So after posting this last night I was exhausted and fell asleep.  Craig messaged me again a half hour ago and then stopped responding. I'm hoping for screenshots soon.
   

 Craig: Sorry I was asleep. I'll try to find that stuff. My wife and I deleted our profile.

Me: Yeah sorry about this mess. Idk how this could happen unless there were bots or my bf was trying to cheat on me.

Craig: No he wasn't trying to cheat, the profiles had both of you.



At this point, I'm afraid it's Ryan. I don't want it to be. He won't answer my text.



UPDATE 2: Thank you to everyone who has responded!!!

1. Something I didn't make clear in the original post is that the first message from Craig was from early January. I hadn't seen it until last night because my facebook settings have it so I only get alerted to messages from people who aren't my friends nor I have given permission to talk to me when I'm in the app or on the website. Last night was the first time I had gone on facebook in about a month.

2. At this point I'm just waiting to hear back from Ryan still. I'm leaning towards Craig is just some creep, but Ryan's silence is becoming increasingly worrying. I still am going to check swinger sites to make sure none of my pictures are being used. I will update again when this is all figured out.


**FINAL UPDATE:** Thank you so much again, all of y'all have made this day easier. Also I want to mention that I hope I never came across as shaming the swinging community, all of y'all from that community were so kind and helpful (especially u/coffeetea_swing) and my problem with all of this wasn't that the concept of swinging was scary, just the fact that my information and photos were being used without my knowledge.

So let's get to it:

Ryan ended up texting me that he wanted to see me. I got a bad vibe so I asked him to call me instead. You all were right. It was him :( apparently the fantasy of swinging was a special kink for him and he used those sites to masturbate. I couldn't find the profiles any sites because he had listed our ages as 23/24 and I had been searching couples 18/19. Craig couldn't find our information because when Ryan received my text last night he went into damage control mode and deleted everything. He had used inappropriate photos of me to lure people into chatting with him. I'm young and relatively attractive so I guess I was good bate. I threatened to call and tell my dad, who is a sheriff, about all of this if he doesn't take down all of it. I'm meeting him at a coffee shop tomorrow to look through his phone and laptop to ensure all my photos are gone.

Needless to say we're done.

Craig said he was sorry and that he didn't want to speak with me ever again, and that him and his wife only were interested in swinging because they thought Ryan and I were hot. I still don't know how the fuck he found me on facebook, and he stopped responding. So I blocked him.

It's all still a bit shocking since it happened like a few hours ago. Julie (my wife, 27F) and Tanya (her sister) are extremely close. Years of family abuse left them hanging on to each other for a long period of time until finally when my wife turned 18, she took her sister and they both ran. 

I've been with my wife for 7 years now, we got married last year and honestly, I've never felt happier in my life. Julie is really the most amazing person you could ever meet. We do have our fights here and there but it's never something too serious. I do love my wife and would never even think for a second to ruin our relationship. 

Now as you've read from the title, something happened today. I've said that I was with Julie for 7 years and I have practically watched Tanya grow up right in front of me. She was polite and charming young girl (she still is) but I've never thought about her being something more than my wife's sister and I have never given any indication that I look to her like something else. 

Tanya has been staying with us for the past couple of days. Julie and I have our own place while Tanya still lives in the old apartment that they both used to live before. She has been going through a rough break up with her bf of 4 years and my wife offered her to come and stay with us for a while, 'till she feels better. 

Tany has been doing fine but she is still very heartbroken over her breakup. My wife would usually deal with her sister but I would often talk to Tanya as well, reassure her that it's gonna be fine, that she will get over him etc. But today was a bit different. 

Tanya was crying a bit more than usual. I heard her sobbing once I got back from work and it really made me feel bad about her. So I've decided to sit and just have a conversation with her. It really did help because she stopped crying and even cracked a few smiles at my attempts to lighten up the mood. As I would find out, today was supposed to their 4th year anniversary and this was the reason for her emotional outburst. 

We've talked a bit more and things got out of hand. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, like when she switched the conversation to me, how I am a great guy and how her sister is truly lucky to have found someone like me. How she dreams of meeting someone like me, how she would occasionally touch my hands, snuggle closer to me. It's truly baffling how I didn't see it coming and I feel awful about it. 

She kissed me and after a second or two I pulled away from her in complete shock. She looked equally terrified as well. I jumped like I just got burned and Tanya immediately went ""Don't tell Julie"" and ran to her room. After maybe an hour, she had already packed her stuff, thanked for the hospitality and left. 

I was left alone to process what the fuck just happened. All that is going through my head right now is ""What the Hell did I just did?"". I felt like I've just cheated on my wife, with her own sister on top of everything. Also for some reason, I feel like I've taken advantage of that poor girl. It's completely irrational and doesn't make sense yes I know, but it's how I feel. Like I've said, I should have seen this. I should have picked up on the subtle hints and remove myself from the situation. But I didn't and in the end, we both screwed up.

My question here is, how do I even begin to explain this to Julie? Do I even try and explain this to her? I know that if I hide this, for now, it will only maybe cause an even bigger shitstorm in the future if this comes out, somehow. So Reddit, what do I do now?
I've never felt this confused in my life and I definitely need help in this.

We have a pretty active social media circle of friends on facebook and Overwatch/WoW.


Well what happened was, we got drunk and he told me that he lets his gf read our chats, on social media and texts and everything. That he usually records our calls with some app and lets her listen to them. He told me that they make fun of us together. Now this is the part where I might be overreacting, I told him that that's pretty fucked up and that if that's true then I wont be contacting him anymore.

He decided to double down and told me that his gf hates me and thinks I'm weird, that half the time he just gives her his phone and reads my messages out loud while he dictates a response. Now I'm sure you all know how 2 guys that have been friends with so long text each other; we have made up words and phrases that don't make sense. But I have also texted him some pretty personal stuff.

We didn't talk much after that night and I went home. The next morning I kicked him out of our chats and have not made an attempt to contact him. All the people in the chats don't really know why I kicked him, I told them that I have a good reason. I'm pretty sure he's telling them his side of the story where I'm blowing things way out of proportion and is probably not mentioning that he lets his girlfriend read everything.

What do you guys think? That's pretty fucked up right? Or am I making a big deal out of nothing?

"My parents [45M/F] think that I [19F] need psychological help because of my obsession with a fictional character.


So, I'm obsessed with Harley Quinn. Me, being uninformed with comics, had only found out about her during the Suicide Squad hype, and curiously watched Batman: The Animated Series. It was from then on I became enamored with her character.

I think my obsession is healthy, however. I've started a collection of Harley Quinn figurines (that I bought with either my own money, or got for Christmas.. from my parents), and I own more than a few articles of clothing that are Harley related. I splurged (again, with my own money) on a custom made Assault on Arkham based costume. My hair is split down the middle, half red and half black. I've also started collecting comic books, too.

Admittedly, the object of my affections changes every few years. Which, I think is normal for a 'fangirl'. I don't do anything permanent like tattoos because I am aware of this.

My parents would joke about it at first, but they suddenly started to pester me about it when I adopted a little kitten named Batman. I didn't even name this kitten, it was a little black cat I got from the shelter who had named him that. 

My mom thinks that I use fictional characters as a coping mechanism and that it is unhealthy. She wants me to see a professional and talk about why I latch onto things. My dad just silently agreed.

Nothing I can tell them will make them think differently. I could be addicted to substances, but instead I choose fictional characters. Does what my mom say have any truth to it?

TLDR; My parents worry something is psychologically wrong with me because I am obsessed with a fictional character and they want me to get help. Do they have a point?"

I am a supervisor at my job. One step underneath a manager, but I'm there on a daily basis to supervise the employees. They're mostly teenagers or 20 year olds. It's a seasonal minimum wage job.  
This one girl works a lot. She picks up shifts every single day there is one open and often expresses her sadness when she can't come into work. I thought this was just normal at first, she likes the job.
She starts showing up later and later, but never more than 15 minutes or so. She works a lot so I never wrote her up for it. Her eyes were also red and puffy a lot, four days in a row it looked like she came in directly after crying. I pried a little bit and apparently she does poorly in school but is there every single day. She showed up with bruises on her forearms but we get those from work, so i ignored it until it got significant. I suspect this girl is being abused somehow. 
The other day, this girls mother calls me. She says that if she comes in to work, that she is sick and to send her home immediately. The girl comes in, and she looks fine. I ask about the phone call and she breaks down into tears and tells her not to send her home. It seemed like an if of an extreme response to just not getting sent home. I let her stay and didn't push any further. Eventually, I sent a bunch of people home early and she happened to be one of them. She didn't protest this time, but I didn't want her in trouble with her mother that obviously didn't want her there. Before she left, she asked me if there was anyway I could schedule her more shifts so she wouldn't have to pick up all the time. 

Do I have any right to call anybody about this? HR will not do anything about it, as they are so afraid of getting sued or something happening. Would i be overstepping boundaries by calling CPS or going to HR?

"Gf [25F] kicked butt at her massive promotion campaign. All credit for it stolen by someone else.


Gf works at a non profit.  It's a big one.  There were 2 projects on the books that she was working with a team from another city on.  The first project the girl from other city took the lead with the understanding that my gf would be the lead on the second one.  The other team then proceeded to obliterate the entire budget for both projects on the first one, and ended up with a lot of waste in the process. 

So second project start date comes around, she takes the lead and starts working on it.  The idea is to market to schools and general public to raise bucks for the org while promoting/educating a good cause.  The problem is no marketing budget.  The other city division starts doing their own thing and not really asking or coodinating in any way.  Rather than confront, her spineless boss decides to just let them do their own thing for their city, and she will handle the rest of the province.  No problem, so she does that.

At some point, the other city manages to score some more bucks from the org, and to fanfare announces this money wasting initiative to make and send these fancy packages out to schools as a promotion.  They of course send the gf a bunch to distribute to a few outside their city.  Spent a week on it, got it done.  

To date that tens of thousands of dollar investment has generated 0 in sales.

The gf on the other hand decided to do a direct marketing campaign through email and direct mail. Got in touch with people in high places, drafted a rather awesome marketing brochure, and sent it out to everyone that the people in high places said to send it to.  For the direct mail part the people in high places got their guys on it to do it for free. Aside from the time to set everyone up, total cost was $0. Currently thousands of orders are rolling in.  

Just today, a company wide email was sent out from the internal marketing team.  Saying how the event is looking to be a success and orders are coming in.  Good job team.  They then said that here is what we are doing, and then described the direct and email campaign, and gave a copy of the campaign brochure.  Which is of course my gf's brochure.  But where her name and info is, it's the coworkers in it's place.  And then of course said that this is the brochure that EVERYONE is getting and the reason for the sales we are seeing across the province.  GJ coworker!

It's so fucking blatant that she was just ripped off.  And of course now everyone in the company thinks that the thousands of sales and the entire campaign for that matter are from that other person...

The question now is wtf does she do?  She has a meeting with her spineless boss tomorrow morning to discuss this.  The idea is to escalate to a top level manager.  But what does she say, how does she craft this narrative, because this kind of thing is so past unacceptable.  But she is afraid of looking like he said she said not being a good coworker trying to steal limelight.

For other info: it's known that this is my gf's project by those working it.  There are tons of emails, from her and to other people including couple managers at the province level that this is gf's project, and she has in detail gave notes of what she is doing to update progress, given sales updates on her campaign, etc since she started working on it at the beginning..  It's very easily proven the marketing email is false and credit stealing.

The problem is that's like 2% of the company who know this as it wasn't company wide, just those directly above who had something to do with the project.

what we think happened:  As the gf did a lot of updates on what she is doing and gave a copy of the template she used, it's likely the other city just took that template, put their name in it, and just copied what the gf was doing for their city.  Not really a problem as they are free to do that.  Marketing then wanted to give an update, and since they are based in that city, went with the contact for that city as they are in fact running that campaign for that city.  And this is the result. Based on previous stories, I can assure you though that the other girl being listed as the credit province wide is no accident.  So here we are.

  **tl;dr**: girl at work stole all credit for gf's massive campaign success.  Wondering how to escalate this up to not let this girl get away with it.  Office politics not a forte.  People with experience on how to play the game needed."
"My[27M] GF[25F] wants to move into a nicer apartment, I have no desire to since I'll be the one paying.


GF and I have been together for 2 years, living together for about 1. 

The apartment that I live in is a one bedroom, 700sq ft. Its in a nice area, has great amenities, and only costs about 1400/month. It was perfect for me before I met my gf, and has been perfect for me since she moved in. 

I should also mention, that I make much more than she does and so she doesn't really have much money leftover. No problem to me, I pay most of the cost of the apartment since I'd live here anyways. 

The issue that we've been arguing about is that she now wants to move into a nicer apartment, one that is much nicer and much more costly. Technically, I could afford it without much issue, but the problem is that I don't want to. Ultimately, because of our incomes, I'd be the one to pay for the majority of the cost, and have no desire to do so. I feel like I don't need a bigger, nicer apartment, and that I shouldn't have to ultimately spend a bunch more money because she wants to live there. 

Am I really being that unreasonable? What should I say to her?

"My [22F] brother [22M] our friend [23M] and his wife [25F] cut me out of housing plans months before telling me. Don't know how to react.


A little bit of background: My twin brother and I are close friend with a married couple, Jane and John. We grew up with John and the four of us hang out 2-3 times a week.

Last January, John and Jane asked me if I would want to be their roommate once their lease was up so they could save a bit of money. I've lived with them before and we all knew we got along so we started planning to move in together in the summer.

In February my brother and his ex-girlfriend broke up. He moved in with my parents (where I live) and mentioned he was interested in living with the three of us when the time came, which we all agreed on.

Skip forward to summer, when John and Jane had to end their lease. They told us they wanted to save a bit more money and had decided to move in with John's parents for the time being. This was fine for us as it gave us more time to save money too.

Since then every time I've brought up moving out they have said the plan was still for the four of us to move into a 3 bedroom together. There aren't many options for 3 bedrooms for rent where we live so it was taking quite a while to find anything.

Today I got this text from Jane: ""Hey, we signed a lease for a house and I don't know if [brother] has informed you yet. I'm contacting you so you feel relieved of any distress that news like this might cause you. The truth is, I only want one roommate. So I confided in [brother] privately around August and asked him if he would be willing to share expenses, in order for us to have a house and a small property. [Brother] invited you as a roommate without any authority to do so. And now feelings can get hurt. There is an extra room, so please feel comfortable to come over whenever you need an escape and to just hangout.""

Now I'm so angry I'm shaking. They've known they were cutting me out since August, but decided to string me along for 6 months, my brother invited himself after the rest of us had already made these plans, and they got a 3 bedroom, they just don't want me to live there. I don't even know what to do. I basically just lost my three best friends at the same time.

John and Jane will no doubt be over to my house several times before they move and I live with my brother. How can I stay civil with them until I don't have to see them anymore?



**Tl;dr After a year of planning to rent a house with my brother and our two friends, I found out they've leased a house without me and have been planning this for 6 months. How can I stay civil with them until I don't have to see them anymore?**

EDIT: Some people have been confused and thought they might have mixed us up. Just want to be clear: my brother and I are fraternal twins and I'm female and he's male, so I don't see how that could happen accidentally."
"My wife's [53] son [25] and his fiance [22] are going into a dangerous level of debt. How to discuss this with them?


My wife's son is 25 years old and engaged to be married to a 22 year old woman. They both work low paying (15 dollars per hour) jobs.

They bought a house together last year. They have taken vacations on credit cards. She drives a late model car bought with a loan. She has $12,000 in student loans and is planning to borrow more. They have multiple accounts at various department and jewelry stores and are using them. They appear to be making minimum payments on all of these accounts and their credit cards. They plan to put a wedding for 200 people on their credit cards. They don't seem to understand the seriousness of the credit hole they are digging.

What is the best way for parents to discuss finances with their adult children? What is the most effective way to get them to realize the consequences of all this debt?
