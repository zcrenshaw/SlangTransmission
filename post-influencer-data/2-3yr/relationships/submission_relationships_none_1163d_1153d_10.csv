"UPDATE: I [31F] realised I recently have feelings for a friend [34M]. We've arranged to go out for dinner next week, but I'm not sure if it's a date. Help!


My first post didn't get that much attention, but I thought I'd update in case it helps anyone else in the same situation.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r1j71/i_31f_realised_i_recently_have_feelings_for_a/

So Last Thursday Jim took me out for dinner. He came to pick me up and I was still super nervous, even though by that time I was pretty sure it was a date. He opened the door of the taxi for me, but I went to go around the other side, thinking he was just getting in the car! He looked really confused until I figured out that he was being a gentleman and we both ended up laughing about it. It kind of broke the ice as he seemed a little nervous too.

We went for cocktails, then for dinner. Despite my insistence, he paid for everything and it was just perfect. We were chatting for hours and before we knew it, they were closing up around us.

Jim walked me to my taxi and kissed me goodbye. My stomach flipped over and I felt like a teenager - I couldn't stop grinning on the way home and fell asleep with a stupid smile on my face.

The next morning, I woke to find a text from him telling me how much he'd enjoyed our date and that he'd like to see me again soon. I couldn't wait either, so invited him over for dinner that Friday evening. He didn't leave until Sunday lunchtime. :-)

**tl;dr**: It was a date. We are now dating and I feel like I've won the lottery. :-)"

"[Update] My [25F] boyfriend [26M] serenaded his co-worker


Hi! Thank you all for your advice. What a stressful situation. Here's a quick update. 

Link to the original-https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rihvk/my_25f_boyfriend_26m_serenaded_his_coworker/


After everything I was really pissed all of last week and was sort of planning on breaking up with him but I was taking my time making the decision because, well, break ups suck and it wasn't something I was looking forward to. I mentioned in the comments of my last post that I own a house that has been sitting vacant since I moved in with my boyfriend and it doesn't have a kitchen right now because I moved out in the middle of renovating it. I have a friend that owns a kitchen company so I asked him to come out to the house to look at it and draw up plans. He told me he would do it at cost without charging for labor and ever since I told my boyfriend that he's like ""what, are you fucking him? But how many blow jobs is it costing you?"" I work for the FD so obviously I work with a lot of (good looking) guys and he's just been so jealous lately, especially last week, trying to tell me who I can and can't talk to while at work. So, all that to say, it was definitely time for us to break up anyways. I just can't believe that he is giving me such a hard time but thinks him serenading this girl right in front of me was ok. 


I did look at a text he got that makes me think they were hooking up. I spent Thursday night out at a hotel with friends for a birthday and came home in the morning. He had a text on his phone that said something like ""omg noooo I was sleeping"" so I read through their conversation (which was conveniently deleted except for two messages) and he had texted her at 3am to see if she was awake. Maybe I'm reaching, but every time a guy has texted me that late it's been to hook up. That sealed the deal for me so I just left, it wasn't even worth fighting over because for a whole week now I've been pretty much done with him anyways. He didn't take it that well, which was surprising because it sure seemed like he wanted to break up, but whatever, it's done now. 


**tl;dr**: I broke up with him. "
"My [25M] best friend [25M] is the vet that put my girlfriends [24F] dog down and now my girlfriend wants me to stop talking to him


As the title states my girlfriend had to put down her dog a couple of months ago. It was really sudden and he was still quite young so we weren't at all prepared for it. He was her dog but we've been together for two years and living together for one so it was hard on me too. We took him to the only emergency animal hospital in our town that's open 24/7 which is where my best friend happens to work. He was the vet that ended up helping us. We ran all kinds of tests and tried a few things to help him but ultimately put him down that night. As much as the situation sucked, I think my friend was excellent at handling everything and my girlfriend didn't seem to have any issues with him. 

For the past two months she has expressed that she thinks her dog wasn't actually sick and our friend just ran all of those tests and put him down so he could make money. I tried to be sympathetic at first but now she's straight up insulting my friend and wants me to stop hanging out with him. My buddies and I have baseball season tickets (she has one too) and every time I go she asks if the ""dog murderer"" is going to be there and if he's going she won't come. She whines every time I get to get together with my friends too if he's going to be there. 


Can you guys think of anything I can do to get this to stop? I think it's really disrespectful and I'm probably going to break up with her if it continues.

"UPDATE: My husband [34M] bought a house without telling me [27F] and now expects us to live in it.


[Orignal Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl27b/my_husband_34m_bought_a_house_without_telling_me/)

I have what I consider to be a pretty happy update, but considering how many people would calling for me to divorce my husband in the last post, maybe you guys won't feel the same. 

We sat down and had long talk last night and again this morning.
I told my husband, in no uncertain terms, that this had been a huge breach of trust and I was in no way happy with the fact that he bought this house. I had called my parents before and figured out how much it cost them to renovate a lot of the rooms in their house, as well as how long they estimated it took. I showed him those numbers and I could tell that that made it really sink in just how much work he had signed himself up for.

All of this finally sobered him up and he apologized for doing this. He said he understands why I didn't want it, and he understood that I wanted no part in the renovations, but he still loves this house and thinks he can renovate it to the point that I will love it, too. And to be fair to him, the house does have nice bones. It's in a good area, and the idea of being able to hand-pick everything and change a few things around to exactly what we want does appeal to me a *little* bit. So I agreed to keep the house.

With that decision, though, comes the condition that he will be doing *all* the renovations by himself. It will come from his pocket, he will do all the work, deal with hiring any contractors needed, everything. We agreed on a few major things that need to be done by the end of this year to make the house livable without it being a total construction zone. The only involvement I will have in the renovations will be input on paint colors, flooring, and fixtures. If he has the major projects we agreed on done by the end of the year, we will move in and I have agreed that I will help a little, but the house will not take up all of our free time. As soon as it does, I am done. 

In the meantime, we will be keeping the apartment. That is where we'll be living for the rest of this year. We agreed on a maximum amount that either of us can spend without consulting the other person. He has agreed to go to marital counseling with me so that we can figure out a better way to communicate so that this never happens again.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm still kind of pissed at him and won't be lovey-dovey for a quite a while, but I can be in the same room as him without wanting to snap his head off. He's still my husband and I still love him. Hopefully in 20 years this will just be something that makes me roll my eyes when I remember it. I'm not looking forward to the coming months of renovations, but I'm glad that I don't have to be a part of it. He can spend his weekends ripping up carpet and insulating walls. I'll be in the San Juan Islands whale-watching and getting drunk on vineyard tours. 

Thanks to everyone for your help.


   
**tl;dr**: We're keeping the house and have some new ""rules"" to assure that this doesn't happen again. Not looking forward to renovations, but I don't have to do any of it so I think this is the best compromise. "
"My girlfriend [24F] of 3 years replaced all of my [29M] clothes while I was away


I'll try to give my girlfriends side here too so it's not too biased. I used to dress like shit, I was perfectly content wearing my gym clothes everywhere and stretched the dress code as much as possible for work. My girlfriend works in the fashion industry so she helped me buy some clothes that fit me better and looked nicer without being out of my comfort zone so I was really thankful for that. I kept all the same gym clothes, sweatpants, Panama pants, old t shirts and sweaters and jeans etc as well as all of my shoes because I figured they'd be fine to wear around the house or to work out because I don't really care how I look for that. I told her she could buy clothes for me if she wants because she knows what I like which is maybe where I went wrong. 


Last week I went on training for work and it was my birthday while I was gone. I got back and my girlfriend had  donated all of my old clothes that she hadn't picked out and replaced it with new stuff. I tried to act grateful at first but honestly I'm fucking pissed off. I don't want to wear shitty stiff jeans that stain the seats in my truck blue and the running shoes suck for actually running. Even the sweatpants are kinda tight which in my mind defeats the purpose of wearing sweatpants. She got rid of all my old t shirts that I bought at games and replaced them with plain colours but now I have barely any tshirts at all. And she spent a ton of money doing this. I know the jeans alone are over $300 and and the shoes probably cost over two grand. She gets a small discount on this stuff but still, she probably spent upwards of 5k on all the new clothes, I looked up some of the brands and it's all really high end. 


I told her I wish she hadn't gotten rid of my old stuff and she said I would have kept wearing it so she had to but offered to go get it back from the thrift store. Well the thrift store apparently sends their donated clothes away to get wasted and then they get sent to various locations throughout our city so basically no one has any idea where my clothes are and they're as good as gone. 


The reason I'm posting is she's now mad at me for being ungrateful and says I'm being shitty and should respect and appreciate her more. But yeah I'm not really that thankful because she got rid of all my shit. Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots that I've been breaking in for years which she actually was able to find but it caused a huge fight. Am I being a dick for being pissed about this? 


**tl;dr**: my girlfriend replaced all of my clothes with nicer higher end versions and I'm pissed off about it. 


Edit-this is getting a lot of responses so I'll add this here to clear things up. I don't dress like a slob, my clothes don't have holes, I'm not wearing lame graphic tees, and everything I've worn out of the house for the last three years (with the exception of going to the gym) has been gf approved. Also I'm not going to break up with her over this, it sucks but not really break up worthy. "

"My [24F] sister died from melanoma. She went to the tanning salon twice a week for 10 years and was out in the sun constantly. I'm angry at her for being so reckless and can't move on from her death


Hello r/relationships. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this because it is about my relationship with my sister but my sister is dead so I guess it's a personal issue. I'm just looking for some help and advice. I'm posting with a throwaway because people know my main and I don't want my baggage out there for all of them to see.

I’ll start with some background about my sister: She started tanning when she was 14. School had just finished and she got a babysitting job for the summer. She used some of the money she made to go to the tanning beds. She would go at least twice week. She was constantly out in the sun too and never wore sunscreen. She met her husband when she was 20 and they got married a couple of years later. A year after the wedding she gave birth to a baby boy, my nephew. When he was a few weeks old she took him to the doctor for a checkup and the doctor noticed a mole on her arm that he told her to get checked because it looked suspicious. She didn't want to go but he made her promise to. She went to see a dermatologist and he was concerned enough to do a biopsy. It came back malignant and my sister was diagnosed with melanoma. The doctors did what they could to treat her but it had already spread. She died on the one year anniversary of her diagnosis. It was one month after her son's first birthday, two months after her second wedding anniversary and three months after her 24th birthday (to the day).

I am so angry with her. I know she’s dead so it doesn’t make sense but I can’t help it. The risks of tanning beds and the sun are so well known. My sister lived in a developed country, in a middle class home and she graduated high school and community college. No offense to anyone who isn’t, but she had no excuse. I tried to tell her and so did other people but she didn’t listen. She went twice a week and baked in the sun every chance she got. She tanned while pregnant. At first she didn’t tell the tanning salon about her pregnancy and once she started showing she tanned outside instead. Even after she was diagnosed with melanoma we found out she continued to tan. She said she couldn’t stand not being tanned. Don’t get me wrong. I loved my sister. She was a good person, loving, kind and ambitious. Her death hurts like hell and I give anything for more time with her. But I am so angry at her and I feel like I hate her too. She left behind a son who won’t remember her, a husband who she was the love of his life and a devastated family and many friends too. She worked at a charity and was always helping people. She could have done so much good but I can’t stop hating her for wasting it. She didn’t even stop when she was diagnosed. It’s been 10 months since she died and all the anger and hate is still there. I’m the same age she was when she died. I love my sister (if that makes sense) and I don’t want to hate her. Please help if you have any advice.

tl;dr My sister used tanning beds twice a week since she was 14 and she tanned outside too. She was diagnosed with melanoma but still kept tanning. She died and left behind a one year old son and her husband and family. I am so anger at her for being reckless but I don't want to hate her."

"My [25/F] brother [22/M] is expecting me to give up a study/internship abroad opportunity and spend the money going to his destination wedding [to 21/F] somewhere I am not interested in travelling to. Am I the unreasonable one?


Throwaway because I don’t want to link this to my post history.

For the sake of ease, we’ll call my brother Sam and his wife Kate. Obviously not their real names. 

My brother Sam became engaged 8 months ago to Kate after a year of dating. They have a 3 month old son. Sam and I have never been super close with each other…..we are very different people and have very little in common. We were very different as kids….I was always reading and he was always playing video games. He dropped out of school at 15, right when I went off to University. He was in trouble with the law for a while there and we didn't have much to do with each other. We get along civilly, but he does allow Kate to make an endless stream of side remarks to me which is a sore point for me. Sam never once sticks up for me, even when my parents have been shocked at what she says. Kate also tries to 'push me out' a lot by saying things like how she is my parents daughter. Basically, she has always tried to take my place to compensate for having had a crappy childhood with a single mother who didn't care about her. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean her behaviour isn't infuriating for me you know? 

Sam and Kate have decided to have a huge wedding and bacherlor/ettes in Thailand and are now expecting me to pay my own way there and book a 11 day trip to Thailand and pay for all my own expenses, including flights. They are taking out a loan to make the wedding possible because Kate has ‘always wanted’ a ‘dreamy beach destination wedding’. (I think that is stupid. I mean it is their life and their finances but why hasn’t that clued them in on how it might also be unaffordable for their guests? If I didn't have savings, would they expect me to take a loan). 

They also want me to be a bridesmaid and given that Kate asked her 2 best friends 4 months ago (I saw it on instagram, she did the ‘will you be my bridesmaid’ proposal thing)….I asked why they were asking now and they admitted one of Kate’s friends backed out because of the coats and they ‘need another and there isn’t really anyone else’. They're angry at Kate's friend for backing out, but she agreed to be a bridesmaid *before* she knew they were planning on taking the wedding from Australia to Thailand. I’m not exactly thrilled about the idea of being a ‘back up bridesmaid’, especially to someone I know dislikes me at worst, is indifferent to me at best. Eff that, tbh. This is going to cost *thousands* of dollars. My parents are not thrilled about the wedding, but are going along with it because they know any disagreement and my brother will take it out on them because whatever Kate wants, Sam makes sure she gets. My parents love their grandson and they know if they 'annoy' Kate too much, they can forget about seeing him. I think Kate knows that and uses her baby to get her way. 

This wedding is not how I want to spend my own money and it is now causing a big drama. 

Even before this became an issue, I was always of the opinion that expensive destination weddings are incredibly selfish and entitled because the couple is expecting their guests to pay a *lot* of money to attend and essentially dictating to them where their next holiday will be without considering they might want to go somewhere else. Go for your honeymoon, don’t make everyone else pay for that too. I mean, I personally have 0 interest in Thailand. I hate the beach……I’m a fair skinned strawberry blonde girl who hates hot weather and can’t go in the water with her contacts in so it’s just…..not my idea of fun at all. I don’t want to spend all my savings on a beach holiday I’ll hate. 

I can technically afford to go based on the balance of my savings account, but I’m saving for something important. I’m currently a masters student studying a double masters in European Union Law and French Translation and have been offered the chance to complete five months study in Paris next year and interning for a major government department for three months afterwards. That is my plan for the money I’ve been saving from my part time tutoring job. The wedding is being held during the internship. They want me to give it up even though it could be the big break of my career. This is how I want to use the money. There is now an expectation I’ll back out of this and go to the wedding and even pay to be Kate’s bridesmaid. 

I’ve said no. Sam is losing his shit because Kate is pissed off I’m not bowing to her wishes. My parents are urging me to reconsider. I know they think this is all bullshit (my father in particular thinks Kate is ridiculous), but they know the kind of hold Kate has over my brother and know if they even slightly upset her, he'll side with her and they might not see their grandkid. They enable her because she’s insane and entitled. 

Am I being the unreasonable one?

One of the things that makes Sam/Kate and I so different is that we have different goals and interests. I have an undergraduate Law/French degree (possible in my country) and am now studying a masters degree. Kate has said on Facebook that her goal is to get a husband so she ‘doesn’t have to work’ and can ‘have babies’. Sam dropped out of school and works a blue collar job. I’m not looking down on that, but it means he doesn’t really understand how important opportunities like the one I have been offered are for careers like the one I am pursuing. We are very different people with very different goals in life, which is fine, but it means they don’t understand that giving up and opportunity like this could be giving up my ‘big break’ and to me, my career for the next 50 years is more important than someone’s wedding day. They *knew* I would be interning in Paris when they selected this date because I told them long before they picked a date. It makes me wonder if Kate knew what she was doing in picking this date. 

What do you think reddit? Am I the bad guy for saying I’m not spending all my money to indulge Kate’s ‘fairytale wedding dream’ and sticking to my study abroad/internship plans or do I have to suck it up?

**tldr: brother is expecting me to spend the $10k+ I’ve saved to study/intern abroad on a destination beach wedding when I hate the beach and the bride is constantly rude to me. Am I in the wrong for refusing?** "

"UPDATE: I [15M] have to leave my home and be alone of the 4th of July because my bio mom [40's] does not want me around


og post:https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r9gx7/i_15m_have_to_leave_my_home_and_be_alone_of_the/

Hi Reddit, so this is not a happy update at all. It would seem talking to Chloe (mom) about it was the worst thing I could do. 

When my mom took me out several nights ago, I told her I was sick of being left out of family events. I told her I was sick on the nick name "" pretty bastard"" that my cousins gave me. Yes because I am better looking then my male cousins they called me pretty bastard. Chloe never knew about this nick name, I thought Ally (other mom told her about it)

When Chloe got home, her and Ally (other mom, lesbian moms) got into a argument over me and the whole situation. Details I don't really want to go into because they are a bit personal were brought up. Well Chloe decided it's best they separate and takes me with her if she could not stand up with her to the family. 

My other mother Ally, well turns out she was cheating on Chloe so she had no problem with leaving the house. Ally said she needs to put her family that did so much for her first. Ally still wants to see me when everything calms down. 

As expected the extended family has cut all contact with us, blocked us on Facebook and everything. Ally has gone to go live with her new partner so it is just me and Chloe (mom) in the house now. 

So yeah, everything fell to shit pretty much. Me and Chloe will be fine financially she has a really good job  

tl;dr: My moms got into a argument over me, turns out Ally was cheating on Chloe. Ally has gone to live with her new partner and extended family has cut all contact with us"
"My sister [26F]'s som has same birthday as our sister [19F] and she's mad that me [23M] and others didn't go to her son's birthday party.


Jenny [26F], Ada [19F].

So last year Jenny had son on Ada's 18th birthday and they share the same birthday. It wasn't urgent or anything, it was a scheduled birth. I didn't like this. I told Jenny that she shouldn't have done this and she got upset and told me that I have no right to tell her when she should deliver her son. Fair enough. 

So Jenny had her son on exactly Ada's 18th birthday. Ada was understandably upset about the whole thing. Jenny at one point told Ada that ""I hope you're not upset that we won't be celebrating your birthdays anymore"". She didn't have a birthday party although me and cousins took her out the night before her birthday. It was the least we could do for her given the situation. 

So we thought that we throw the party for Ada this year. We've been arranging it for quite a while now. However just a few days before the birthday, Jenny said that she's going to have a birthday for her son as well, on the same night. Again I suggested that she can have one one night before or after, but she insisted that the party will be on the actual birthday. She told us to reschedule or accept that people won't come to Ada's party.

Ada was again upset but there was no need for her to concede this time. So we kept the plans as they were. The birthdays were last week so two parties on the same night. Almost everyone from our family and friends came to Ada's birthday. So at Jenny's party they had only people from her boyfriend's family.

So Jenny is now extremely upset at me, Ada, others, parents, everyone because she thinks it was embarrassing for her that she didn't have anyone from her side at the party and it looked like she doesn't have anyone and people don't care about her. I think it was her own fault. We already didn't have a party for Ada last year and this year we planned/announced it weeks before she did. If she had moved the party a few days around I'm sure most people would have attended it.

Now Jenny expects us all to apologize to her and promise that from now on we won't let her down like that. I don't think anyone has anything to apologize for and I don't think that anyone has let her down. By doing things like that she's setting herself up to be let down.

So what should we do? End the terror and give her what she wants or stand firm? She's usually used to getting her way but I think this time she's going too far. 
   
**tl;dr**: Sister arranged her son to be born on our little sister's birthday and now demands that we treat her son's birthday as higher priority and is upset that we didn't. She wants us to apologize. "

[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4saiyh/me_28m_moving_to_new_city_bought_house_with/)

Thanks for all the advice, I have a happy update for you. She showed up at my new job yesterday to surprise me and she's going to be staying out here. The reason she kept putting off moving was that she found out she is pregnant (it wasn't planned) and was scared to go through pregnancy and have the baby without her mom close by to help. She finally told her mom on Monday and her mom reassured her and bought her a plane ticket and sent her on her way. 

As exciting as that news is, she's known for about two months now and only told me yesterday, so clearly we have a lot to work on. We think there was just way too much going on at once, with the move, my new job, her quitting hers, our engagement, etc and now the pregnancy. It was just too stressful for her. I'd appreciate any advice on how to make this easier for her. 

**tl;dr**: she finally showed up, she didn't come because she was pregnant and was scared to not have her mom around. "
"How do me and my friends [20sF] tell our other friend [25F] we don't want her toddler to come on our vacation?


Hi Relationships,

Last year a group of four girl friends [20sF] and I started a tradition of renting out a particular cottage during the summer for a weekend getaway with each other. This usually consists of us being unreasonably drunk/loud all day and night and something we look forward to all year. 

Six months ago when I began planning for this year's stay, we made sure to plan early so we could give Ella [25F] a lot of time to figure out what she can do with Lily [2F] in terms of babysitters. However, Ella said straight off the bat that her attending is unlikely. We were bummed but we understood. 

The cottage vacation is now a couple weeks away and Ella informed some of us yesterday that she will be attending and she is bringing Lily. Umm what?

Lily is an AMAZING girl and I'm always happy being in her company. But this is our vacation! So we can get drunk and swear and not worry about anything! Like any toddler, she requires a lot of attention to keep her occupied. Which I am always happy to do, but not during this trip.

First of all, the cottage is tiny, and I myself will be sleeping on a couch. Ella informed us that her and Lily will be tenting outside, but if it rains...I'm assuming she will feel like she will have to bring her toddler in, thus stopping the festivities so Lily can sleep. Another girl was also planning on bringing her dog, but since Lily is coming, she doesn't want to have to be watching their interactions all weekend and is now making other plans for the dog. Third of all, this cottage is on water, so I'm sure that we all will have to be doing some babysitting at some point during the trip to make sure she stays safe. Lastly, I don't expect Ella to put any money towards the cottage since she is tenting, but she will be using the facilities and I'm the one in charge of the safety deposit...the entire thing just seems like a big request to me. 

Two girls that are closest to her tried to explain to her yesterday that they love having Lily around, but this wasn't the most appropriate setting for her to be in. From what I was told, Ella got defensive and still insisted she wanted Lily to come.

How do we let her down easy, Relationships? She and her daughter are wonderful human beings, but she just doesn't seem to understand it's a lot to ask of us. It's a very sensitive subject so I'd like to be as courteous and understanding as possible.

My husband and I have been married for 3 years. For the first two years we lived together on the east coast in an apartment I owned outright. Last summer my husband got transferred to the PNW for work. Several factors eventually led to the decision of my husband moving out west and renting a small place, and me staying back home and finishing out my contract. That contract ended in June and I moved to join my husband. Since then we have been living together in his studio. Recently, since I'm not working right now, I've been spending my time looking for a bigger, nicer apartment for us that is within our budget.

Well, I found a couple places and decided this past weekend would be a good time for my husband and I to look over them. This is when he decided to drop a bomb on me: he bought a house and wants us to move in when the lease is up. He was really excited about it, talking about how this is ""our"" place, how it's the perfect little starter home, and how it'd be perfect to start a family.

Reddit, I was livid. He took me out to look at it, and I'm absolutely floored at how idiotic this decision was. The house is a piece of crap. He bought what was in our price range, and that doesn't buy much out here. I grew up in a ""fixer-upper"". Every single summer of my life from ages 12-20 was spent doing projects ranging from painting to building new bedrooms. When I was young I promised myself I wouldn't own a house until I was at least 30-35.. I hate all the responsibility and headache that comes along with it. Honestly if I could have it my way I would never own a house my entire life, but I know it's something my husband wants, so whatever. 

And my husband knows this. He knows exactly how I feel and as soon as he showed me the house I let him know all of that once again. But he doesn't see why I'm so upset. He says he thought I would be happy and says he'll do all the work. Yeah, sure. That's what everyone says until they realize how hard fixing up a house is.

I want to live in a nice apartment and spend our weekends taking day trips and exploring this part of the world, not in old paint clothes ripping up berber carpet. Honestly I don't know what to do. I'm fucking pissed about this situation and pissed at my husband for doing this without consulting me. 

Should I just suck it up and be grateful? Part of me realizes he thought it was a sweet gesture, but the other part of me is really dreading that the entirety of my foreseeable future will be spent with renovations. Does it have to be that bad? Am I being a bitch for being this upset over it? Plus, he bought the house already. How can I even get us out of this? How do I even look at my husband without seeing an idiot who just ruined the next 5+ years of our lives?



   
**tl;dr**: Husband bought a fixer-upper when he knows I'm not ready to be a homeowner. I really don't want to go through with this, but don't know how to get out of it or have him see my side of things."
"I [16M] have been complaining about throat pain [for 5-6 months. My parents have told me it's nothing and my sister [14F] complained of ear pain today and they took her to the doctor.


Hi Reddit, I need to know what to do. I am not sure if this is the right place but it says advice so I am assuming it's right. 

For the past 6 or 5 months I have had a really sore throat, it has been itchy, burning, dry and it feels like some flem is there and it just won't go away. My throat get's really unnaturally hot sometimes. I have told my parents about this for months I have not stopped bitching about it. 

My parents have told me it's fine it's a cold, but I have had this cold for months now. My parents keep telling me you are a big guy, it will go away naturally. 

My sister complained of ear pain today and they took her to the doctor. I just I don't understand how they can take my sister to the doctor and not me. Because I am a big guy it should be fine

I live in Missouri, my older sisters live in Massachusetts so she is states away and I have no other family here, Can I go to the doctor myself? 

tl;dr: I have been complaining about throat pain for months and my parents told me it's nothing and did not take me to the doctor. My sister complained of ear pain today and they took her. "
"Birth mother paid off my college education, died, and now everyone feels I owe them money.


My birth mother Linda [50sF] paid all my college debt off a few years ago. My adopted mom passed away when I was 12 and my Dad [62M] works a lot and lives in another state. I am not close with him, he is not someone who really likes to keep in touch much. 

I [27F] was contacted by Linda when she got sick. She said she wanted to tie up loose ends. I had a great relationship with her for two years before she passed. During this time, she told me she had two other kids. They were both older than me. Linda had me during a time when she was divorced from her husband, slept with another man, and couldn't care for me. 

I don't blame Linda for my life, I had a good one, I get it. So we were able to have a sort of... aunt/niece relationship. 

She paid off my student loans for me, saying she did it for all her kids. Long story short, Linda passed away six months after paying for my loans. I got a check in the mail and did not attend her funeral [as it was in another country from where I am now living.] I did, however, send her husband flowers for her grave and plan to visit when I have time off from work. 

I got a box of keepsakes from her [pictures of when she was pregnant, a baby book she made for me, letters] and a check for a small amount [less than $2000]. There was a note with the check saying I should spend the holidays with my father. I don't make enough money to come home and Dad cannot pay the $2000 for a ticket.

Linda is one of the nicest people I have ever had in my life and I felt guilty that she gave me money. But she changed my life when she did. I wouldn't be able to teach in Korea if not for her, which was a dream of mine. 

Recently I have gotten a message from my [half] brother Jason [39M]. He said that he had read the will and saw I was listed on there. He looked me up on FB and found some pictures of Linda and me together. So he knew it was me. 

He told me that he had two kids, one was 12, the other 16. He told me that he had gone over his mother's bank statements and found she gave me a large sum of money. 

I explained she paid off my student loans. 

He then accused me of using ""HIS"" mother for cash, that I was not entitled to the cash, and the money came from a college fund ""Mom had set up for her grandkids."" 

&gt; You are not her daughter or my sister. I am furious that you would come into her life and demand money from her. You had parents. 

I have had other people write me on Facebook that I don't know but figure are related to Linda. One is the daughter [16] the other is an aunt [50s]. They have all said the same thing: I took advantage of a dying woman, promised things I shouldn't have, and took what belonged to the daughter.

They want me to pay for daughter's education. I told them no, I was not going to do that. I don't know this girl, I don't know them. All I knew was Linda. I blocked them all and locked down my profile. 

I am just at a loss what to do. I didn't ask Linda to pay for my college and I certainly didn't ask her to deny some girl her education. I am debt free, living a good life, and now I feel like some girl got shit on because of me. My birth family now thinks I am a manipulative brat. That I swooped in to take some poor sick lady's money. 

I don't know what to do? 

**TL;DR** Birth mother paid off my college education, died, and now everyone feels I owe them money.

"I [26F] ran away from a forced marriage. I helped my sister [19F] escape as well. She's having a difficult time adjusting to life in the US.


When I was 17 I was given to a 37 year old man by my parents. I had no choice in the matter. I actually didn't talk to him until after we were married. All I did after that was to stay on birth control so that I wouldn't get pregnant, I eventually was able to contact some human rights organizations and they put me in touch with the right people who helped me come to the US as a refugee when I was 23.

Last year my sister told me that my family are looking for a husband for her and I suggested that she should come to me. I got in touch with the same people and they were able to help her as well, and I was able to bring her here 3 months ago. She now lives with me.

The problem is that she's not adjusting at all. She continuously tells me how much she misses our parents and how alien everything is to her here, how difficult life is and she wishes that here was more like our home country. She's going to classes to learn English and other necessary things and she's making progress but she isn't happy and I know it can be difficult and I can't seem to be able to help her. She talks to our parents a lot and they keep telling her to come back and even though I've explained to her that the key for us being safe is to minimize contact but she hasn't.

I'm running out of ways to help her but it's clear that she needs help and I don't know how to. Any suggestions is welcome.

"UPDATE: Me [30F] with my friend [34 M] of 2 years, will NOT accept that I don't want to date his friend.


Alright, here we go. Original post below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4od4w5/me_30_f_with_my_friend_34_m_of_2_years_will_not/

So after I made my original post things seemed to be fine. Then I learned over the course of a few more instances who this guy really is. 

First I should mention that while I met Eric 2 years ago in this new city, he is not a model but works in the industry. I'm trying really hard to not be obvious because everyone involved uses reddit. 

We worked on one of my shoots together and the owner of the video production company later randomly called me and asked me if he could take nude photos of me. Naturally I wouldn't be able to tell a soul including his *wife* because this was a *secret* hobby of his. I told that guy my answer was a **hard no** and never heard from him again. I sat on that disturbing situation for a while then one day told Eric. His response was an underwhelming ""everyone has their issues."" So I followed up with "" I just think you should know, in case you're introducing models to him for networking purposes; you know what he's capable of."" Eric responded with a flat ""thanks."" Eric didn't know the production company owner, they met on the set of my shoot. So I don't know, we aren't friends from way back but I expected some sort of loyalty at least in his response? I wasn't expecting him to say ""I'll never work with the guy,"" but he couldn't have cared less.

Eric continued to make comments about setting me up with his friend, to which I continued to make clear I was uninterested. Then finally we all got together for brunch. At one point Eric and I were left at the table alone and I said ""alright let's talk"". I wanted to schedule a shoot a couple months out that he would be involved in. He immediately assumed I wanted to chastise him about continually suggesting that I date his friend. I said ""no, that's not what I was intending to discuss, but to reiterate your friend is a great person, but I am in no way interested."" That was the last time he brought it up. So I felt he had the ability to be reasonable if pressed, but certainly pushed boundaries.

One night we were playing card games and I started to notice that he seemed annoyed with everyone all the time. He seemed incapable of being challenged even in the slightest ways, often pouting. He'd get up, throw his head back and leave the table etc. His wife was CONSTANTLY apologizing to him for things that didn't seem like offenses. At one point he got up and left the table and she said sorry to him, no kidding, 5 times in rapid succession.  As she was apologizing to him for one of his imagined slights, her friend piped up and said **you don't need to apologize**. She'd been friends with this guy for longer than she knew her husband, so that was my signal something was up. I didn't know them to comment on their relationship. They just got married, so they could literally be driving each other up a wall. However, the friend's response let me know that perhaps this wasn't first year marriage problems. This was after another outing where he was flat out being mean to her. When she walked away he said she was having an anxiety fit. Didn't seem that way to me. Anyone would be frazzled by their significant other being a jerk to them in public. I noticed that aside from the one friend of hers piping up for her, his other friends just sort of sat quietly. 


If you haven't noticed I don't easily develop opinions about things. Being a model means that people perceive you as and treat you as an idiot constantly. I've endured my fair share of false perceptions so I try to feel people out until they ""hang themselves.""


Fast forward to the 4th of July, we're up on their rooftop and the sun was BEAMING. I was wearing a shirt dress with a sports bra and running shorts underneath. I pulled down the top of my dress and tied it around my waist. So imagine I'm sitting in a sports bra, with a bunch of clothes tied around my waist. At some point we started discussing Marvel Comics ( a mutual interest of ours). I commented how I was tired of the franchise not developing Storm and Rogue's story lines. He then awkwardly chimed in that if women wanted to be perceived differently they needed to change the way people saw them, ""manage the T&amp;A"" (Tits and Ass). It was the most random, irrelevant, and ridiculous thing I'd ever heard. Everyone else just got quiet and looked at him. I challenged him. I told him that Wolverine runs around entire movies with no shirt on at all, so what was his point? He then made another bizarre comment of ""everyone has to do their part, if I know a friend is an alcoholic I'm not going to put alcohol in front of him."" I asked ""so you're saying that men are addicted to women's bodies and as a result are helplessly incapable of controlling themselves and their own actions. So instead, the woman is responsible for managing the oppression?"" He repeated ""everyone has to do their part, it's not fair..but it's how it is."" This went on, before I realized it was idiotic and I was done with the conversation. His wife sat quietly, everyone did.  At that moment I knew I would never be close ""friends"" with him. In my opinion I felt he revealed himself as a misogynist and it made perfect sense that he felt he could set me up with his best friend, where I would be bringing majority of the benefits to the table.

Sidenote: He is obsessed with being right and sounding intellectual. If you make a counter argument he will smirk, look down and to the left as if you're the biggest idiot.

I recently got into gaming as a way to manage the mental stress of growing my business. They all game as well. Recently we were playing online and Eric threw a fit while we were losing a game. I told him all the things he said we were doing wrong, he was doing himself as well. He got louder, and I got louder. I will not be spoken over by some guy who I feel is loud and wrong **all the time**. Then he said ""you're new to the group so you don't know this, but I don't like be talked to that way."" 

Oh dear, I've definitely noticed ;-).  


AGAIN, everyone got quiet. His best friend was also playing with us and said to him regarding the game ""Eric you seem to be the only one who feels this way."" To which Eric responded ""well make me not feel this way."" His best friend said ""I don't know how to not make you not feel this way."" Eric went into full pout mode and would not speak. Anyone familiar with gaming knows that if you get into a game against other people, you have to commit, lest get a deserter penalty. Well Eric didn't commit on his end and we all got a deserter penalty, because he had to go use the restroom. He didn't bother saying a word in advance, he just left. When he came back someone asked why we got a deserter penalty, and his best friend STRUGGLED to explain why, because he was trying to avoid just saying what Eric did. My final realization was that this guy over time has conditioned his friends and family to walk on eggshells for him. I'd had enough. We all ignored his pouting and kept playing.

So I'm back on the friendship market. I won't be proactively trying to hang out with them. Although I do find everyone around him wonderful, I suspect none of them would be friends with me 
anyways if he caused enough of a stir about it.

Sorry I'm exhausted while typing this, so please forgive me for not including each redditor's names:
 
Regarding meeting friends, r/relationship suggested Meetup groups which I've tried but will give it another go.

I had another person comment that they were surprised I was having trouble dating in tech. I can't explain it more beyond most of the men in this exact niche of the tech industry are much much older and married. So this particular part of the industry isn't bustling with dating options for me.

I had a redditor comment that she too encountered many bad apples because of her looks as well. She had to learn that many ways these men were asking her out seemed harmless or even romantic, but were quite the opposite. Her comment was so dead on for me  that I copied it to my computer to look at every now and then as a reminder.

I also want to reiterate that dating is **not** a priority for me right now. I truly am focused on building a platonic friendship base here, so that I can find some balance.

EDIT: To clarify I work with Eric in the modeling industry, my soon to be full time business is in tech and completely separate. It's just that someone asked why I couldn't find a date in that field so I mentioned it. Sorry for the confusion!

EDIT 2: The gaming community has been incredibly welcoming and it's much appreciated. Although, I'm shocked only one person guessed the game I was referring to. SMITE baby!!! :-P

My brothers girlfriend pushed me over outside and I hit my leg on some tree branches that were from a tree we cut down. She told me and my twin sister never to talk to my brother when she is over. My twin told her we would tell our mom and brother what she did. 

She told me she makes my brother very happy in many ways and he would never forgive us if we told him. I needed stitches in my leg and I don't like his girlfriend. She is such a cow to everyone except my brother and she is always hanging off him. 

My brother is upstairs in his room and I can't sleep, he looks after us at night when mom is at work. My twin thinks we should tell him because he has always protected us from things. when there is a spider he always kills it for us when we were younger he checked our closet for monsters even though he was young too.

"Me [21 F] with this guy I've known for a while[21 M], rejected him because he's religious, now I'm the bitch.


So, this guy and I have been friends for a while, and recently he told me he liked me and asked me out on a date. I rejected him politely, and he started pestering me about why. After a few such messages with me repeating ''It's really not you, it's me'' (which sounds cliché, but you know... It is /me/) he asked whether it was because he was religious and I said in part, yes, it is because of that. 

Here's the thing- I live in a very catholic country and I've had nothing but bad experiences with religion. Being religious is a deal breaker for me. Is it wrong of me to feel like that? On some level, probably, as I do understand being religious does not automatically make someone an extremist but I don't want those kinds of people as life partners- it brings about a million of huge, important life questions, some of which I cannot compromise on, and I wouldn't ask someone to compromise their beliefs on my account either. He knows this is my view, as we've discussed it a few times, peacefully and rationally.

He went off, calling me shallow and what not and like... Ok, I can handle that. I can recognize that I'm known to be shallow at times, I can live with that. But he talked to our friends and even put a status update on facebook along the lines of ''LosingMyReligionLOL wants me to reject God, but I'd rather be rejected by her than do that'' which was... A bit over the top, and unnecessarily dramatic if you ask me, but fine. People are sometimes emotional in these situations. I get it. 

But here's the thing- I'm being bombarded with messages and e-mails from what I'm sure are well-meaning friends asking me to reconsider my stance- why don't I give him a chance? He's SUCH a nice guy, though, and the fact that he's religious is really such a small thing about him! You'd hate it if someone rejected you just because you're not religious, that would be unfair! You're so intolerant- maybe you should consider attending a mass or two and broaden your horizons? Friends have also cancelled our dates and I've been uninvited from a wedding, due to the fact that 'I won't share the true joy of the sacrament because of my narrow views'. I don't really care about the sacrament, I'm there to celebrate what's supposed to be the happiest day of your life so far, and it hurts me that that's not an option anymore. 

What I'm asking here is not if I was right or if he was wrong. As far as I'm concerned, and from what I've been seeing, I've made the best possible choice. I need to know the best way to deal with this onslaught of attention and slander (admittedly, this is a dramatic way to put it) from my friends because I'm tired of explaining to everyone that yes, his religion is a part of the reason I rejected him, and while it is the thing that cemented my decision, it is not the only thing. I need to know how to actually come to terms with the fact that my friend of seven years would have me over for coffee but not for her wedding. How do I deal with this? Do I just cut out everyone who continues to badger me about this? Give me some tips, reddit, I'm begging you. 



   
**tl;dr**: Rejected a guy mainly because religion is a dealbreaker for me and now there's a campaign that's both against me, because I'm so ''narrow-minded'' and a campaign for me to change my mind and date him. How do I deal with this?"

"I [29F] learned that my husband [32M] had a son [8M] that he doesn't know about who just died. Do I tell him or take it to my grave?


I've been married to my wonderful husband for three years now and we have two 1 year old sons (twins).

Earlier this week a woman contacted me, I know of her (I didn't know her). She is ex girlfriend of my husband. They were together for a very short time. She asked to meet to talk about something really important. So we met yesterday. She told me that after she had broken up with my husband she realized that she was pregnant and she told him that she got an abortion. My husband told me about this.

In reality, she never had that abortion. She had the baby and never told my husband. Since they didn't remain in contact my husband never knew of the child's existence. And the child has now passed away because of Neuroblastoma. She said that she couldn't live with herself if she didn't reach out to us and leaves it in my hands whether to tell my husband or not.

So now I'm left with this devastating news which I don't know whether to tell my husband or not. He'll be devastated to hear that not only he had a child that he wasn't in there for him but the child spent a long time being ill and my he didn't do anything to help, and the child is now gone. If he knew the child he would have wanted to be in his life and be there for him in his time of need. This news will destroy him. On the other hand it's the truth, and I don't know how hiding this might affect him in the long term if he ever learns.

The child's mother told me that nobody else knows my husband is the father and she herself won't ever contact us again. 

I don't know what I should do. It's such a huge thing and I don't know if I should keep it from my husband for the sake of sparing him the pain.

My dad talked to my aunt and she thought that the venue isn't friendly and comfortable for me and that's why she didn't invite me. If that's the only reason, isn't that something I should decide? Maybe I can handle myself in that venue. Maybe my brother and dad will help me if I needed help. She excluded me because I have a disability. My parents told me that I need to understand that it's her wedding and she gets to decide who comes and I can't be upset and I should respect her decision. I told them that if she thinks I'm not good enough to be at her wedding then I don't want to see her or talk to her again but they tell me that I should continue to be a good niece and respect her and be friendly with her. I don't understand why?

Do I have a right to be upset and not wanting to talk to her again?

Thank you everyone for your input, it really opened my eyes past the good feelings and made me realize the bad were unacceptable. We had a talk, and I eventually got out. I blocked his number, quit the job I had, (Don't worry I have another that'll do for now), to cut off all contact.

It's weird to know, but after I laughed and a wave of relief washed over me. I didn't even know I was sad and so stressed and anxious, until it was over. I feel free for the first time in so long, thank everyone for your wake up call! I can't describe how helpful it was and how grateful I am.

"Me [28/F] with my boyfriend [31 M] little over a year, heartfelt email made him furious with me


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mk7ei/me_28f_with_my_bf_31m_little_over_a_year/


Tl;dr of original post: Boyfriend took my time for granted, always made last-minute plans with me, made me a quasi-priority. He didn't seem to understand why I felt this way when we discussed it so I wrote him a letter about it, the letter made him furiously angry.


Just wanted to say thank you for the responses. As I'm sure you can predict, we broke up. Not immediately though. He was somehow able to 'forgive the feelings of betrayal' about the letter. How he felt betrayed, I don't know. Things were ok for a week or two. We ended up having another argument at a tough time where I really needed him to be there for me. He told me that 'no one had ever treated him so disrespectfully before...none of his other girlfriends especially.' It was like I snapped in an instant.


I thought, what the fuck was I doing in this situation? He wasn't supportive. He made nice plans but they were always last minute. I was trapped in an emotional prison where I wasn't able to express how I felt about anything without meeting his wrath...no matter how I expressed it. He was stingy. He'd spend thousands of dollars on himself on a whim but if I wanted to do something I always had to pay for us. Or if he did something nice for us it was always on the super cheap. And I mean super cheap. Like making me a candlelight dinner of the leftovers in his pantry/fridge. He wasn't that way when he had friends come into town, we'd be painting the town red at those times and he would be paying for all of it. I realized that I was doing all of the work.


So that night when we had that fight, I packed up my shit, gave him his key back, and walked out.


I am still in therapy and am currently working out why I would put so much effort into a relationship with someone who could barely be bothered with me. Painful stuff but I know I will come out stronger, more aware and better for it.






   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend was an ass. Spent a lot of time being his emotional caretaker while stifling my emotions because of his unreasonable anger. Talked to Reddit about it (thank you!) and ditched that jerk!"

"My [28f] boyfriend [35m] was arrested


Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4r7yu3/my_28f_boyfriend_35m_is_going_to_prison_im/

After consulting people in my life - friends, family and then after reading the reddit thread I decided to do what most people were telling me to do - I broke it off with my boyfriend. The day after the reddit thread I got a meeting with him in the evening. I told him that I can't live my life like this, I can't be with someone who would jeopardize his entire life like this, his future etc. His employer had already told him not to return and he seemed really bummed out about the whole thing, when I told him that I can't do this he seemed hurt and I just started crying. He didn't get upset, he was a bit irritated it seemed, but then he just said ""Well, I guess this is it then, I'll tell someone to go pick my stuff up from our place, bye."" and left the meeting. I got some support from one of the wives of his friends (she's my friend/acquaintance I guess you could say) she told me that she was 100% divorcing her husband after this as well, that she's already filing papers - she told me not to listen to anybody saying I'm doing the wrong thing because both of them are just ""pieces of shit"". She told me her husband had promised her that he was done with all of the criminal bullshit and that she couldn't do this anymore, so she doesn't even blame me for leaving him at all.

I've been crying for the last couple of days. His mom called me the very next morning and called me a piece of trash, a horrible person, said that I'm a snake who used his son and abandoned him the second something bad happened to him, that I'm a snake because I can't even trust someone who I ""supposedly"" loved. I tried explaining her my side of things, she just kept screaming that if I loved him I would have supported him no matter what. She ended our conversation by saying that she's happy this happened because at least her son managed to see who actually cared about him and who didn't.

That evening, he got bailed out of jail. I was coming home from the store when I saw a van parked in front of my house and I saw him carrying his stuff into it, I pulled into our parking lot and went into our apartment - his friend was there with his girlfriend moving his stuff with him. They said hi to me, we chatted for a bit. Then a few minutes later he came back to get some more boxes, all he said to me was ""I talked to our landlord, I sorted myself out of the lease."" and then just got his stuff and left, he didn't even really seem to care about me at all. I pretended I didn't care, but I had locked myself in another room and I quietly weeping until they left. A lot of people, who I considered mutual friends, have also deleted me off of facebook.

I don't know what to do now or what to feel. I have to find a new place now because I can't afford this one. But I feel like I destroyed the best thing that had ever happened to me and I can't get over the feeling that I made a massive mistake. I always considered myself a loyal, caring and loving girlfriend- but I feel like I can't even ever claim that now because I might have abandoned the love of my life. However, at the same time I feel like a rock has just feel lifted off of my chest.

 
**tl;dr**: Broke it off. People hate me. He got released, got his stuff and left without saying anything. I am just so sad I don't know what to tell you."
"[Update] My fiancée's best friend's boyfriend asked us [24 M &amp; 24F] to back out of our trip with them so he could attempt to rekindle their struggling relationship. He offered to give us a full refund and even extra to cost the inconvenience. Unsure how to proceed.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbrfi/my_fiancées_best_friends_boyfriend_asked_us_24_m/

Mia and I didn't end up going on the trip to New Orleans with Sarah and John, after posting we really thought about it and a lot of the comments were right that we would likely have a horrible trip and be blamed for if they did happen to break up. John didn't end up telling Sarah about the drastic change of plans which pretty much put it on us (More specifically me to tell her the news).

Mia said she was dreading telling her best friend that her boyfriend had asked us to back out of the trip so I offered to do it for her. I talked to Mia about it and I told her how I was going to do it and in general what I had planned to say. I didn't know if I wanted to telling her how it was and call it a day or if I actually wanted to try to fix / put Sarah's relationship into perspective. Sarah is a very pretty girl there's no denying that but her biggest flaw is how she treats people. I try my best not to judge because I don't know how she ended up the way she is now, and according to Mia she wasn't always so standoffish and inconsiderate. I actually remember when I first met her years ago thinking she was a surprisingly decent person. 

Anyways I had lunch with her Friday and pretty much told her that we were going to be backing out of the trip and that John wanted her to go with her on the trip to spend some quality time together. She overacted as I assumed she would and immediately got angry and wanted to call John out for being so selfish and requesting something so unreasonable of us. I told her that it wasn't that big of a deal and that we could always do something smaller later on during the summer and that I advised that she consider going with him.

Eventually she calmed down and started asking me for relationship advice, something I've purposely never given her because I always felt it wasn't my place to tell her anything. I don't like giving relationship advice in general because everyone's relationship is a little different and everyone is willing to put up with different things. I start telling her about Mia and I and about the small things we do for each other and how we try our best to communicate and just small talk about it really. I tell her why I think we're successful and how we're a team.

And she says something along the lines of ""You sound so amazing and I wish John would do something like that for me."" I call her out in a friendly/joking way that she shouldn't say things like that especially not to her boyfriend. ""If I didn't know any better I'd say you might be wishing you were with me."" totally joking around with her trying to lighten the mood without scolding her even though her saying that is like a huge issue.

She laughs and then there is a long pause followed by silence, and that's when everything pretty much started to click about her relationship, her behavior with John and all that other stuff. She never actually admitted it but I basically tell her that if she really loves John that she shouldn't attempt to throw away her 7 year relationship on a maybe or a possibly because there is a high chance that it will never be more than just that. I think she pretty much got the message.

She did get a little upset I figure it probably was the first time someone had preemptively turned her down or maybe she realized how much she had ruined her relationship. She pretty much told me to be honest about the state of her relationship and if I really thought that there was an chance she could fix it. I told her I think it would take a lot of work but if she was willing to self-reflect that she definitely save them. I told her she should talk to Mia because honestly she could give a better insight. 

She did talk to Mia as well shortly after our little lunch thing and I guess between Mia and I something went right because John and Sarah went on the trip New Orleans by themselves and they came back and they both genuinely seem happy with one another. I'm sure it's too early to say if they are just riding the vacation high or if they'll really last but John gave me the most bromantic hug I've ever received in my life when they came back and thanked me for whatever I did/said.

Mia and I ended up taking a brief trip to New York by train from July 2nd &amp; 3rd to do some light shopping and for the rest of the week we actually decided to to take her 2 younger siblings and their best friends to beach for a couple days which they all seemed to enjoy. And we did end up giving John back the extra money he gave us.


Thanks for the advice, crsis adverted.

**TL;DR:** We backed out of the trip, I broke the news to Sarah and we helped put her relationship into perspective. John and Sarah had a great time in New Orleans and seem to be on the right track with fixing their relationship. Mia and I went to New York for a few days and then took her younger siblings and their best friends to the beach.

"Me [38M] and my wife [36F], married 15 years. Things have been horrible for a long time, I've been trying to get her to help me fix things and go to counselling, she refused. When I presented her with divorce papers, she now wants to start working on things and go to counselling. I'm lost.


My wife and I have been married 15 years.  We have four kids, aged 13, 10, 8, and 5.

The past few years things have been progressively getting worse and worse.  There was a lot more tension between us, we were fighting a lot and a lot.  She would often get angry at the smallest thing, if I was late in doing something, or if something was not perfectly clean like she wanted it to be or done on the exact time, she would throw a fit and explode.  It was always directed to me, small things she would get very very angry and it was making it unbearable.  Whenever I tried to talk to her about it when she was calm, I'd try to explain to her she had anger issues and emotional issues, that she was always getting angry and overreacting to simple things, she would just get angrier and shout at me.  It was horrible.

Her relationship with my parents became absolutely atrocious to the point of the detesting each other.  Every time there was a conflict between me and her, my parents would take my side and defend me, to the point of her hating them.  I reached the point where whenever she would have one of her anger outbursts, I would just leave the house and go to my parents house until she had cooled down.

I found myself more often than not looking for reasons to avoid her.  I'd stay after hours at work, just go for drives, I'd dread coming back home cause I couldn't think of what reason she'd be angry at me today.  Every time I tried to approach the issue, she always made it out to be completely my fault and refused to acknowledge she had an anger problem.  She would always blame me, saying it was my fault, I didn't listen to her, I'm pathetic and useless, that my parents turned me against her and they are the bad ones.

The things she would get angry over are really little things.  I'm home late from work.  Dishes aren't done on time.  I bought the wrong grocery by mistake.  Something I was cleaning isn't perfectly clean to her satisfaction.

I tried telling her many times we should go to therapy and couples counselling, she would always turn it on me and say ""so you think I'm the problem? Its entirely your fault"".  I got sick of always apologising to her for things I didn't do and I said, fuck it, I'm never apologising to you for anything.

The sex life was non-existent, we'd been in a dead bedroom situation for about a year or more, only making love on anniversaries, valentines day, birthdays, special occasions.  Probably less than ten times a year all together, it was horrible.  If I tried to bring it up or ask for it, she'd treat me like I'm some horny animal for even asking, always always come up with excuses.  It was always usually ""I'm too tired"", implying that I myself wasn't tired after the whole day at work.  Even when she'd done barely anything, it was still ""I'm too tired.""  I began to really resent her, she wouldn't even do this one thing for me, she had no consideration for me at all, besides the fact she was constantly berating me.

It reached a head one day after she had spent hours just ranting and ranting at me while I was sitting on the couch trying to watch tv, I just stood up and shouted at the top of my voice ""ENOUGH. SHUT THE FUCK UP.""  I lost my cool and shouted at her on the top of my lungs in front of the kids.  She instantly started crying and making herself out to be the victim, she went upstairs calling her friends and family telling them what a horrible husband I was, she wouldn't even talk to me or try to talk things out.

At that point I knew our marriage is dead.  She is a horrible person who has no love or respect for me at all, does not even want to give me the basics of communication.  I contacted a lawyer and was in contact with him for quite some while before I presented to her the divorce papers.

At first she didn't believe me, she got angry and started yelling and ranted, like ""YOU divorce ME? YOU'RE the one with the problem, not me.""  After it set in, she started crying and trying to reason.  She was apologising for what a horrible person she'd been, telling me she loved me, she wants to work on our marriage.  Its the first time I've seen her apologise or express regret for anything in years.  I've asked way too many times for her to work on our marriage, she always refused, but now she wants to.

I really don't know what to do? Should I accept her apology and agree to go to counselling? I wasn't expecting this from her at the last minute to be honest. I thought she'd just accept the divorce.  Is this just an act of desperation on her part or does she truly want to change her behaviour and change the fundamentals of our marriage and how she's been treating me?  Should I accept and give this one chance, or should I just refuse and press ahead with the divorce?


   
**tl;dr**: Marriage reached absolute breaking point after years of wife treating me badly and refusing counselling.  After I finally presented her with divorce papers, now she is suddenly apologetic and wants counselling.  I don't know what to do."
"UPDATE: Me [25M] with my GF [24F] of 1.5 years. She brought home a kitten after 9 months of me saying ""No""


My original post on the matter [can be found here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o6mdd/me_25_m_with_my_gf_24_f_of_15_years_she_brought/) along with the TL;DR.

Short update: We broke up last night. We both love each other still, but she believes that it's what is best for her.

Long update: Shortly after I posted my original thread, I got home from work and found the kitten(GF had already left for work before I got home). Because it was so young and playful, it mewed when I left it in the kitchen/living room with the doors closed to the bedroom so that it wouldn't wake me while I slept during the day. It was heartbreaking to feel like I was ignoring her and the thought of no one being able to play and care for her was exactly what I feared about getting a pet when I said to my girlfriend that I didn't think we were ready yet. Before I fell asleep, I texted my gf at work telling her all of this and how awful it made me feel. I fell asleep.

When I woke up, I read through the comments that all of you left me, laid in bed for a little bit, and then GF came home. I reiterated how badly it made me feel not being able to take care of the little kitten and how it only solidified in my head that we weren't ready for a pet. I took some suggestions that others had offered, such as giving her a hard expectancy date for when we *could* get a pet and what stipulations would allow that, but she didn't want to hear it. I asked her to bring it back, give it to her parents or someone else, but she just flat out said, ""No."" 

We argued about some of the stuff I mentioned in the original post about how she felt I was more of a figurehead and some other things until I took a shower. I considered everything you guys had said(some of which I did or did not agree with), as well as my own thoughts on the matter, and when I stepped out of the shower, she had fallen asleep on the couch. For another half hour I thought about things over and over in my mind, until I finally made the decision I felt there was no going back from. I walked up to her, she woke up, and I said, ""**I don't think this is a healthy relationship anymore and I think you should move out,**"" and then I walked out. -This was 3 weeks ago...

That first night was the hardest for me. I missed her next to me in bed, especially when I came home from work in the morning, and being with her doing every day things like grocery shopping and at that point wasn't sure if I actually wanted this. She moved in with a friend because she doesn't have family from around here, and we were texting semi-regularly about our relationship and she said that she thought it was best we didn't live together for now. She said she felt like she was in an abusive relationship. Not physically, but emotionally. That because I asked her to move out, it took away the safety she felt while with me. I told her that if I had a child who felt like they were in an abusive relationship, I wouldn't want them to be with their partner either, so if that was her decision, I would support it. I knew that wouldn't be good for our psuedo-relationship, but I agreed that it might be better she move out.

The 2nd week we got together a couple times and talked face to face. She admitted that it was wrong to bring home a pet like she did without me on board. She also told me she bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 2 of them before her friend told her to throw it out. Before that, she hadn't smoked in over a year because I asked her not to anymore. It killed me because I really thought she wanted to make those kinds of positive steps in her life for more than just me, but I was wrong. All of this sent things in the wrong direction again, despite it seeming like we were actually going to try and work on our dynamic and make things healthier for both of us.

This past weekend we went to a friend's engagement party together. Things were ok there, but the following days she went camping with her family and then came over to see me last night. I had a feeling things weren't going to be the same. We had stop texting frequently, rarely saw each other over the last few weeks, and when we did talk, it was mostly platonic subjects. It felt over and I felt lost. Last night she told me she thinks we should break up. She felt that we have too much baggage and we'd be too resentful of one another to be able to continue forward. I thought we were on the verge of working through things, but I guess she did not. She said she still wants things to be amicable because we were, afterall, great friends. I told her that I couldn't be just friends and it would hurt too much to see what she's doing and with whom, without me too. We both still love each other. We both told each other that. I told her that I probably will always love her. We hugged for a couple minutes and then she left.

**TL;DR**: My GF and I broke up. We both love each other and there will be so many different things that I think back on and smile about, but evidently, love is not enough.

One more thing I'd like to say is that I appreciate everyone who lent a hand with offering advice and consolation in my previous thread. But I would also like to say that matters of the heart are never as clear as you'd like them to be. The advice I read was often in black or white and rarely forgiving, despite what side of the story folks agreed with. So I urge you all to at least consider approaching matters in this sub with a softer heart at times and the benefit of a doubt when giving advice. Once again, thank you all."
"My [33 F] husband [33 M] of 10 years freaked out when I revealed my pregnancy, suggested that an abortion was a ""good option"" for us and confessed that my body disgusted him all within one week. Am I justified in wanting a divorce?


It's so easy to doubt myself right now ""because hormones,"" but I really feel like this might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

My husband and I have been together since we were 16. High school sweethearts, teenaged parents, high school dropout (him), the works. We have overcome a lot to get to a place where we are financially stable, so we have recently been focused on ironing out the wrinkles in our marriage. We have been to counseling, spent a lot of ""us"" time, tried talking through our issues and concerns, but I think I'm done. His issues have always centered around his insecurities. They keep him from putting anyone's feelings before his own. Case in point, when I revealed my latest pregnancy. 

I knew that this wasn't exactly good news, so I prepped him by asking him to ""please be kind."" That didn't really help. He proceeded to insinuate that I got pregnant on purpose and that ""we have options."" He knows that an abortion isn't an option for me, so that made me feel alienated and incredibly alone. Over the next few days, he kept ""jokingly"" bringing abortion back up which drove me further away. Things came to a head one night when he confessed that my post-baby body disgusted him ""sometimes.""

This whole situation has made me realize that my feelings have never come first. I'm always supporting him and boosting his ego, while he promises to try harder *next* time. At this point I feel like I've built a marriage on IOU's. We argue, I cry, he promises to do better, but never really does. I feel like I've been married to the man I want him to be instead of the man that he is. 

So there are reasons I've stayed with him this far of course:
He's a good provider, bright future, we have two boys together, I'm not currently working and we live thousands of miles away from our respective families. It's hard for me to say that I love him right now, but I know that is true. He says he doesn't want a divorce, but this morning our browser was open on a ""spousal support estimator"" website for the state of California. He says he wants to fix things, but his actions show otherwise. 

So here I am - pregnant, jobless, emotionally bruised and full of doubt. A beggar that is wondering if she can be a chooser. 

Is this as good as marriages gets? Given my precarious situation, should I just keep pretending that I believe that his emotional IOU's are worth anything? Should I lower my expectation that my husband should care about my feelings?
   
**tl;dr**: My husband was an insensitive jerk during a time when I really needed him to put my emotions first. This is the latest in a long series of infractions and I feel like giving up on our marriage. Am I being unreasonable/ungrateful? Is this the most I can hope to get out of a marriage?

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice and support. It helps knowing that I'm not being crazy or unreasonable. I need to organize my thoughts before he gets home, but thanks to a lot of your comments I feel empowered to stand up for myself. "
"My [26 M] wife [24F] has a crush on a male co-worker and lies to me so she can spend more time with him


We have been married for less than a year, dating for almost four and have a toddler together (she is everything to us).

We both work at the same coffee shop and money is very tight for us, so we share a car and a phone. I will work the morning shift and my wife will work the night shift. We usually have a two-hour gap between shifts so that we can comfortably get home and spend a little bit of time together.

My wife has a crush on her male co-worker, which I have known about since it started a few months ago. I don't want to be that crazy jealous guy, so I figured she can talk to whomever she wants as long as it never crosses a line. I don't ever want to tell her that she cannot talk to someone. But most of our co-workers know, which puts me in an awkward spot between pretending to be oblivious to it or be the 'jealous boyfriend' type.

Recently, it has gotten worse. She will find ways to cover and switch shifts so that she works with him more often. This week I caught lying about something our boss said, so that she can find a way to work with this co-worker again. She now sees him 4-5 times per week, and we only see each other for two nights per week

Normally, I would be able to handle this better, but I recently caught her talking to an ex-boyfriend. I walked into the room and she turned the laptop around and told me I couldn't see what she was doing cause she was shopping for Father's Day presents for me. I  knew something was up, and snooped on her Facebook. It was innocent enough, just a casual Facebook conversation, and she didn't hide it once confronted and considered it bad judgement to not give me a heads up she was messaging an ex on Facebook. So on top of everything else I now have some big trust issues.

My biggest fear is confronting my wife about this, because I am afraid she will pack up and leave with the baby and the car (which is her name). And it is so embarrassing to have to see my co-workers every day, most of whom know about this crush.
   
Tl,DR: My wife has lied to me to see her crush more often and I have major trust issues because I have caught her lying before. How do I confront her? Should I confront her?

Edit: I have started talking to her. In the middle of a fight right now. She is probably mad that I am on the computer during the fight.

Edit 2: We talked things out. She said it is not emotionally cheating, but admitted that she would be mad if the tables were turned. We agreed she needs to find a new place of work and at the same time work on the marriage. She has an interview tomorrow with a former boss, but for now we need the money, so she is at work with the other guy."

"Updated - My friend/work colleague [23F] got caught as an Instagram ""mistress"" and has lost friends/fired from her job. She wants me to help her, I feel like she deserves it.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4syh8j/my_friendwork_colleague_23f_got_caught_as_an/

I would just like to say thank you to the people who actually gave advice and didn't just criticise one of the parties involved or get on my back about it. I'm from England, and this has developed overnight after a night out. First I would just like to clarify something.

In my original post I said that I felt she ""deserved"" what happened to her and people got on my back about it. I didn't explain it properly but my thoughts were that she has got a job she has wanted since she was a teenager and called it her dream job, that she could advance up the ladder for years to come since she was lucky enough to get it straight out of University. I think she deserved it because she should have known that if she got caught, she was gone, especially since she had her own face on the page. I don't really think she deserves to lose all her friends but they have completely different deal breakers to me, so I can understand their stance regarding it.

I went out to a bar with some friends, I had spoken to Joanne earlier and she seemed upset, so I felt like I would get to the bottom of why the hostility towards her. The main reasons given by the group were:

* Joanne had a very good job that she has wanted for years, and she has thrown it away for either sexual fantasies, greed or both. They say this wasn't really a big deal but it was a factor.

* That they wouldn't care if she was just a dominatrix as they have done stuff like that in the past with their boyfriends (not being actual paid dominatrixes). It is the fact that her instagram page was encouraging people to bankrupt themselves for her and encouraging married men to make her their priority over their wives/kids from what she titled her photos/videos.

* They wouldn't speak to her if she was cheating with a married guy and could understand if she didn't know that they were married, but actively seeking them out as her primary clients they thought was disgusting, even if she was just playing a role.
So yeah admittedly I don't know much about what financial domination is but apparently they are decided and there's nothing I can do about that. Their minds, their lives.

The problem this morning was Joanne phoned me after she saw a tagged photo of me on facebook from the night out the night before. She asked me if I managed to sort it out with our friends, I told her no they have decided, and straight up told her I won't be involving myself with her job as it was her mistake that cost her and I don't want to damage my professional life over it. She went on a rant about how much of a ""pathetic cunt"" I am, and how nobody really likes me, they just pity me. I hung up, and proceeded to block her on everything without even reacting to her. I was one of the only people who hadn't ditched her, but I'm not going to get treated like crap just because she isn't getting her own way.

tl;dr: Went out with friends, they explained in detail why they didn't want to speak to her. I accepted their reasonings and left it. Joanne phoned me this morning and started berating me so I've blocked her from everything she could talk to me on now. I have no plans on talking to her again anytime soon."
"Update: I [16M] just had my ex and best friend [16F&amp;M] come into my work and tell me they are both leaving me for each other. They also asked me if I could not go to the circus tonight that I bought tickets for


Link to original problem:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rlzg9/i_16m_just_had_my_ex_and_best_friend_16fm_come/

Hi everybody, thanks for all your help &amp; support. I have my friend Jade with me right now, she is my best friends ex girlfriend and we both need to know what to do. 

Our exes Summer and Jordan aka the rats, did not wind up going to the circus. I went with my friend Kelsie and I had fun with her there. I think they may have gone and saw me and decided to leave. When I got home I decided to call Jade and see if she knew what was going on. 

She was painfully aware, Jordan dumped her over Facebook. So with Jade they took the cowards way out and did it where she could not cause a scene, and they did the exact same thing with me at my work. We both feel like we wasted 2 and a half years of our lifes with them. The sad thing is we were both asked out by other people during this time, but we turned them down because of our partners. 

Summer and Jordan have posted on Facebook about how they are going down to Florida for a week or two. So they have been doing stuff behind our backs and we had no idea. They were and this is the part that hurts the most and we feel really alone.

Our friends knew about them, they knew Summer and Jordan have been together behind our backs for 6 months now. When we were at work those two were on dates/fooling around and they told people. Our friends excuses was "" we thought it was best you figure it out for yourselves""

They had the balls to probably fuck each other and then come running back to us. We told my mother about this and my mom is awesome. I can talk to her about anything and she thinks we better go get tested. If they cheated on us then who else did they sleep with. Is it necessary to get tested?

So we have no real friends and our partners were rats. We don't know what to do with ourselves anymore. Jade is staying the night at my place and we were going to go swimming in my pool, or sit in the hot tub and order pizza. But we just feel so betrayed by everyone 

**tl;dr: Went to the circus had fun. Friends news my ex girlfriend and ex best friend were seeing each other. For 6 months they knew and did not say anything**

"I (M/30) gave my girlfriend (F/26) a birthday present two months ago. I found it unopened in a drawer in her room.


My GF and I have been together for 2 years now. Her birthday was in May and due to a business trip, I could not be with her on her birthday. She totally understood (or so I thought) and while she was a little sad, she knew I'd be thinking of her. 

I felt so bad for missing her special day that I got her something really nice to make up for it. Not only did I buy her a necklace that she's been eyeing every time we walk by the store (not a cheap one, either - think of one of the more expensive jewelry places around) I made her a kind of care package out of the box. I put in the necklace, her favorite candy, a stuffed bear from the city I was in (she collects them), and a handwritten card. I sent the package as soon as I got to the city to make sure it would be there before her birthday so she could open it. 

I let her know the package was coming, and she seemed really excited. When I called her on her birthday, she seemed happy and I didn't suspect anything was wrong. Now that I think back, she didn't mention anything in the box specifically, but I didn't notice it at the time. I was just happy she was happy. She always goes all out for my birthdays (surprise parties, big gifts, you name it). So I hoped I'd done something special for her. 

I started to notice that she never wore the necklace. I asked her about it a few times and she mentioned she was getting it cleaned, getting a shorter chain, etc, etc. I stopped bringing it up. I was at her place last night and she asked me to look for something in her room. While I was looking, I found my package to her sitting in the back of a drawer, unopened. I know it was my package, because I drew inside jokes of ours on the outside of the box. It was sealed.

I confronted her about it, but she assured me she just reused the box for other things. When I asked why she sealed it, where the necklace/bear/card is, she brushed off my questions. I asked if I could see the box, but she said she had ""private"" things in there.

I'm absolutely baffled. I'm 100% sure she never opened my package. I have no idea why. It's not even about the money of the gift, I feel really hurt that I went through so much trouble to do something nice for her and she ignored my present. I can't even think of one reason why she didn't open it. She wasn't mad at me for the business trip, or if she was, she never showed it. She's never done anything like this before. She's never even lied to me. 

What's going on here? Is she telling the truth? 

   
**tl;dr**: Sent my GF a birthday box two months ago, found the box unopened in her room. She assured me she was reusing it, but won't let me see the box 

EDIT: woah I fell asleep and now there's a lot of comments...thanks guys! I'll try to respond now. "
"I [45F] don't want to pay for my stepdaughter's [18F] college because I have no relationship with her. My husband [46M] disagrees.


My husband and I got married 2 years ago. He has two daughters, one who is in her late-20s and the other (Sara) is 18. I have a son and a daughter from a previous marriage who are 10 and 14. My son and daughter live with me &amp; my husband. My husband's older daughter lives with her husband in another state &amp; is financially independent and his younger daughter lives with her mom about an hour away. 

My husband's eldest daughter was in her mid-20s when I met her and we get along well, she's a nice girl and we have similar personalities. My husband's younger daughter Sara was 17 when we got married and I haven't had much of a bond with her. She was very rude to me in the beginning but has since calmed down a bit. She has a lot of loyalty to her mom, so she's just kind of living her own life and doing her teenage/young adult stuff and isn't looking for a mother figure in her new stepmom. Sara visits our house once or twice a year, but meets up with her dad/my husband all the time.

Sara graduated high school this year and a couple of months ago asked my husband what he could put towards her college education. My husband said he would get back to her on it. That night he said ""Well, we're gonna need to give at least $20K to Sara, I don't want her saddled down with student loans. Kristen (his ex-wife) said she can cover $5K and we'll have to give the rest."" My husband makes about 1/4 of what I do, so I asked him, ""Do you have that much money saved up?"" (Reference: We keep our finances separate). He said ""No, aren't you going to help out?""

This is where I'm going to sound really bad but honestly I don't have much of a relationship at all with Sara. She was 17 when we met and she had no interest in talking to me, so I stopped trying to reach out after a while. While I do make a lot more money than my husband does, I also pay a lot more of the bills, which I've never held over his head. I'll be honest, I could afford the $15K a year for Sara's college, but I have ZERO contact with her and haven't had a 1 on 1 conversation lasting more than 10 minutes with her ever. I feel that money would be better used saving it for our immediate family. On a side note, I've never asked my husband to pay anything for my kids. 

My husband is upset and this has been an issue now for a few months. 
   
**tl;dr: My husband &amp; I keep our finances separate and now he wants me to contribute to my stepdaughter's college fund. I don't have a relationship with her at all and she's been rude to me in the past. Should I give her the money?**"
"How do I (23F) get it across to my husband (25M) that him being tired is not the same as when I'm tired?


Using my novelty account because my husband knows my main.

I am currently four months pregnant with me and my husband's first child. The first trimester was really rough. I slept about twelve to fourteen hours a day and lost about 15 pounds from morning sickness. Ever since getting into my second trimester it has only improved slightly. I don't constantly feel sick, but I have no appetite and trying to eat with no appetite makes me sick.

My husband recently talked to me about me slacking in my part of the housework. We both work full time and split the housework evenly. I fully admit and own that I've let my duties slip and promised him I would work harder at doing my part. My problem is this:

I explained to him the reason I've let things slip is I'm exhausted. The baby is taking most of my energy and fueling my body is hard because of my loss of appetite. I don't sleep as much as I did, but I still go to bed super early. I told him I was sorry and it wasn't an excuse to let things go, but I needed him to understand I was very tired. He responded with, ""Yeah, I'm tired too sometimes."" 

He suggests working out and eating certain foods to give me energy, but doesn't seem to get that I don't have the energy to do anything but crash after a full day of work and errands.

I don't think he understands that there is a monumental difference between our versions of ""tired"". He is a wonderful and supportive husband and has been great through this pregnancy, but he just doesn't seem to understand that when I say the baby has taken all my energy, I literally mean ALL of it. How can I get him to realize that I'm exhausted?

tl;dr- Husband doesn't seem to understand how exhausting my pregnancy is. How do I get him to understand?"
"My [45 F] Mother [68 F] canceled reservations at a hotel at Comic Con and is now mad I mad other plans

"My [19F] manager [25M] had unlocked my phone and was recording a private video of me and my partner onto his own phone, and I caught him


Apologies for any formatting issues as I am on my phone. I'm also sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I didn't know where else to go.

I work in a retail store with different departments. This involved the manager of my specific department.

Today, he suggested that he, I and the other colleague working our department go and help out on another department, since we were finished for the time being, and the other department was short staffed. This was nothing new, and happens a lot. We all went down there and worked together for a bit. He disappears; I assume he's just been called elsewhere, and think nothing of it. 

I had left my phone to charge in the office, which I haven't done before today. I was running very low though and needed it to last. I did hide it, but I understand it was stupid of me to leave it like that.

I finish what I'm doing before I'm due back, but I head back anyway. I go into the office to check my phone and find my manager with my phone in one hand, his phone in the other. I had approached close enough as he noticed me to see that he had his video recorder running on his phone, but he had managed to close my phone. His hands were shaking violently. For clarification, I didn't know that he knew my password.

I asked why he was on my phone and what the hell he was doing. He claimed he was just taking a picture of my Pokemon on Pokemon GO to send to a friend on snapchat. I then asked why would unlock my phone just for that, why didn't he ask, and why were his hands shaking? He says they aren't shaking, but they are, and really violently.

I unlocked my phone and he had closed the app so it was on the home screen. So I looked at my open apps list, and there, open, was an extremely private video of me and my partner (I don't wish to elaborate, but I hope you can fill in the gaps :/). He had been recording this private video to his own phone. 

I freaked out and ran off to the staff area and to the toilets. By this point I was crying hysterically and a manager of another department had seen me run in there. She came to ask if I was okay, what was wrong, I said at the time I couldn't say. She said that was fine, and to go home if I needed to. She suggested I get a drink and some fresh air.

I went outside, and my manager was out there. He pleads with me to talk to him, that he's really sorry, trying to grab me etc etc. I told him to leave me alone and do not touch/talk to me, and walked outside the car park as far as I could without leaving the site. He thankfully didn't follow me. I called my friend to pick me up, went back inside to collect my stuff and left. 

I called my boyfriend as soon as he got off work and he urged me to call the store manager and report him. My friend is saying to do this too. 

I'm worried about reporting him because I feel like it will destroy my friendships with other colleagues who are also good friends with him, and I don't want to do that, but I also know that I can't go back to work with him anymore. It feels like a lose-lose for me. I like my job, besides what happened today, and I don't want to lose it, but I feel like if I don't leave and report him, I'll be driven out. 

I'm sorry this is all so jumbled but my head is a mess. I'm so worried and mortified and upset. He had texted me apologising saying he'd deleted the video he took, but how do I know this? What if he took more than one video? What if he distributes this? That's not only damaging to me, but my poor partner too. What if I let him get away with it, and he ends up doing it to someone else? I can't trust him. I don't know what to do. I feel so violated. 

My boyfriend is going as far to suggest police. I don't want to do that. But I have to do something. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to go about this? Again, I'm sorry for how jumbled and ridiculous my words may sound but I can't think straight. 

Thank you all

Tl;dr: my manager recorded an extremely private video of myself and my partner from my phone. My partner is pushing to me to report but I'm worried about consequences. Going as far as to suggest police. Desperately seeking advice on what steps to take next. 

Edit; hello everyone, I just woke up and it's the next day. I want to sincerely thank every one of you who commented and gave advice, I am eternally grateful. I have to go to work in about an hour and I am going straight to the store manager and/or HR and reporting this once I get there. Many of you are suggesting I go straight to the police as well and I am strongly considering it, as people have said he may still have traces of the video that I definitely want destroyed. I need to speak to my boyfriend first though because I'm scared of dealing with the police on my own. So far I'm definitely going to be seeing a manager though. I will post an edit at the end of it. Again, my deepest gratitude. I will try to respond to comments when I get some time. You guys are fantastic. Thank you"
"My wife [29F] of 4 years is mad at me after I [32M] said I would save her before our son [1 month] if I had to make a choice.


I guess this is a stupid problem to have, but in a way it's not my fault. My wife was the one who came up with the hypothetical, although I don't know why. She's never been one to play these sorts of games. 

I don't think there's any way I could have known what way I should answer so I answered honestly. However, I did emphasize that I would never want to choose and would do everything to avoid a situation where I have to save either of them because I do love them both very much, but I love my wife more. In time my answer may change, but that is how I feel now. 

But my wife doesn't see it that way. She is pretty upset with me, and nothing I have tried so far has worked. I've explained myself and tried to reassure her that I love our son, but she's convinced that I don't really love him and am only saying it to make her happy. I don't know what else to try to change her mind. I've thought about taking it back completely, but I don't know if she would believe me or if that would even make things better. We are new parents, so should I just shut my mouth and leave it alone for the time being? I haven't apologized because I don't think I did anything wrong, and I would prefer not to start apologizing for situations that aren't my fault. 



   
**tl;dr**: After my wife asked if I would save her or our baby in a life-or-death situation, I chose her. She's mad at me because she thinks I don't love our son. I've tried everything I can think of to fix it. Is there something else I can try, or should I just give her time?"
"how to tell family and friends that I (22/f) have cancer and I'm going on hopsice


After a couple months of mystery symptoms, a disbelieving and apathetic PCP, finally some referrals to specialists, and fighting for PA's for various tests, my mystery illness finally got a name: ovarian cancer! Not what I was hoping for. I had an initial consult with a gyn oncologist yesterday, he said stage IV with about 6 months to live. He recommended going on hospice, as palliative treatments would only extend my lifespan another six months and I would spend a lot of that time as sick as a dog. I haven't told any family or friends about this because I don't think it's fully sunk in for me yet-- I'm comfortably numb right now and I should probably find a way to come to terms with it first.


I'm probably going to take the hospice option (going to think for another day or so though) and this is where I need some help from you guys: I'm already dreading telling people about my diagnosis, but justifying my decision to not ""fight"" it sounds like a huge nightmare. Some people I tell are not going to take that part well. What's the best way to put it so that they understand this is my dx and my decision, without disregarding the fact that this is going to be really hard on them too?


Here are some other questions: How do I handle notifying friends-but-not-super-close-friends? It would feel weird giving them a call like I plan to do with my close friends, but I really don't want to do something like make a generic fb post. My parents are going to want me to move back home, and it's probably the right thing to do as my condition deteriorates, but how do I let them know I want to do it on my terms? I'm not ready to jump on the plane this moment. How do I let people know that I want to be treated as normally as possible? I don't even know if that's possible, seems like there is no normal anymore. And sounds really full of myself, but I imagine that people are going to want to maximize their time with me now, but I'm worried about being swamped and not being able to do the things I want to do. How do I politely say no without disregarding their feelings?


And please, any other advice you have would be so great right now. I'm so lost, I don't even know what to ask.


tl;dr not a lot of time left, need help telling people"
"My husband [45M] gave his mother [72F] items that be built for me [40F] last year as a gift, then lied about it.


My husband and I have been married for 16 years. He rarely gives me gifts, but despite this fact he built me five beautiful planter boxes last year. He is not the kind of person who regularly builds things, so this particular gift was special to me; it meant a lot that he put the time and effort into creating something just for me. They turned out really nice, though I hadn’t planted anything in them yet, as we have been in a severe drought.

I was working in the garage yesterday and realized that I hadn’t seen my planter boxes in a while. I asked my husband if he knew where they were, and he told me they were out in the yard. Something about the way he answered made me suspicious and I asked him to show me… he hesitated, and then admitted that he’d given them all to his mother when she was visiting last month.

I was absolutely crushed by the fact that he would give my planters away to his mother without asking me (and he knew I would never agree, as his mother is always trying to get our stuff when she visits). He’s an only child and cannot tell his mother “no”.  I feel so hurt and betrayed; I was unable to hold back my tears last night (and I don’t often cry), but instead of apologizing or offering comfort, he said something along the lines of “I don’t even care if you are upset”. I’m hurt that he gave my stuff away, but more hurt that he doesn’t care how he made me feel. The worst part is that now he’s acting as if I am in the wrong by being upset about him giving my things away to his mother.

He told me he’d get them back from her “next time she visits” but she only comes once or twice a year and she was just here last month. I don’t feel like I should I have to wait for him to remedy his error and am inclined to tell him that I expect him to drive up there and get them from her this weekend since he gave them away, lied to me about it and now is acting like I was in the wrong for being upset.  Would asking him to go get them be an unreasonable request given the circumstances?

tl;dr Without my knowledge or permission, my husband gave special items that he built for me to his mother. He refuses to apologize or acknowledge wrongdoing. I want him to drive 6 hours to her house to get my property back.

"My MIL (55) keeps trying to make me (28F) into her pretty, pretty princess daughter, and my husband doesn't see a problem.


So, my MIL (55F) always wanted a girl but had 3 sons: Arthur (35M), Brian (32M), and my husband, Chris (28M). 

I am currently the only daughter in law. Arthur hasn't dated anyone seriously in years and will tell you he doesn't believe in marriage or kids -- he is a cool guy, travels the world and writes, enjoys his life, etc. Maybe someday his mortality will catch up to him and he'll settle down, but I wouldn't count on it. Arthur is pretty traditionally male in his interests (sports, beer, etc) outside of travel and even his travel is more adventure travel than anything else (not saying that's masculine, but my MIL is not very interested in it per se). Brian is gay and married, but both his husband and he are ""guys' guys"" -- really into sports, their house looks like a bachelor pad/frat house combo still, etc. They're super cute and fun to hang out with, but neither of them are doing any shopping, style, etc, stuff with my MIL. My husband is into a few cultural things and is a little less traditionally caveman masculine in his hobbies (he still doesn't want to go shopping or anything, but there's less of a ""steak and sports"" vibe from him, though we both still like both of those things!). He's the one his Mom at least taught to cook, for instance. I have very similar interests to my husband: Sci Fi, video games, sports, etc, except he likes cooking and I just like food (so he cooks, I clean, but I digress). We're DINKs and plan to keep it that way. I think Brian might want to adopt some day, so if she has grandkids those are her best bet, but they seem on the fence. 

For the time we dated and the first 3 years of our marriage (we've been together 6 years, married 3), we lived far enough away from my MIL that it was a non-issue. But recently we moved near her, and she is obsessively trying to get me to do girly things and kind of getting aggressive when I'm not interested. I was polite and went shopping with her a few time, got our nails done (I got a clear coat and refused the press on things adamantly and she got very upset!), etc, but she wants me to constantly get beauty treatments with her, go shopping, take cooking lessons, etc, and I am just not into it. She has never come over to play board games or gone to a science exhibit with me, or catered to any of my interests. She even gets mad if I have a beer with dinner when we go out to eat and don't want to get froo froo drinks and try hers instead. 

My husband has not been very supportive, saying she just wants to get to know me. I have tried to point out that whenever she ""gets to know me"", she doesn't seem to like me because I'm not girly enough, and he sees that too but says ""Well you're her only daughter and she's probably not getting grand kids, can you blame her!"" Honestly, I need a way out. I've even suggested we get new jobs again (we moved for his job, I do contract work (coding) from home and can do it anywhere -- but I make a living and a decent income) to get out of here because I hate living so near her, but he seems to think it just takes time. It's been 4 months and seems to be escalating. She stops by a lot when he's at work (and I'm working) and acts like I should just drop things I'm working on. She tries to make plans every weekend for just her and I and then criticizes anything I actually want to do. She clips articles on how to be more ladylike. It's really oppressive. 

How do I talk to my husband in a way he understands to get his Mom to back off? Or talk to her, but the latter seems fairly impossible, as I feel like she never listens to me. My husband listens, empathizes, but then doesn't *do* anything to support me because he doesn't want a giant rift with his parents. (My FIL is awesome and has called her out at least once in front of me, but he's usually not around when this happens.) 

Edit (suggested by someone I add these details that are in the comments now): In trying to keep this short, we have a) made sure she didn't have access to keys she somehow got, b) I have not opened the door when she came by when I was home working (husband at work), c) told her not to come by (but my husband feels bad not letting her in because she will pound on the door for like 10 minutes if you don't) unannounced and asked her to leave for hours sometimes when she doesn't. I have told her I do not like these things, she has lied to me that we were going to a science museum I suggested and then taken me to a luncheon, re-ordered drinks for me, you can read my comments for more. But we have tried to set boundaries every nice, polite way *I* can think of. Looks like maybe we have to get mean, but she has this victim narrative (all her sons think FIL is horrible to her and so is his family that never accepted her or something) that my husband buys into a little (not with me, but ""she's had a hard life,"" etc) so I was trying to avoid being too mean. I'm going to sit down my husband and talk to him about the sexism, using that word, and using ""feelings"" words because I have a tendency not to express feelings but rather logic, etc, and that might be impeding things. 

TL;DR -- MIL is going crazy because I'm her only ""daughter"" (DIL) and we moved near her, so she's trying to act out mother/daughter fantasies, but I'm a nerdy sci fi tomboy and she's driving me mad. Husband doesn't get it. "

"I [29F] took care of my MIL [50F] after her accident but stopped because she was horrible to me. Did I do the right thing?


Using a throwaway because I don't want this to be traced back to her somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been with my partner for about 5 years and his mother has never been very nice to me. She had a difficult upbringing which explains her selfishness so I never took it too personally. If I had to go from foster home to foster home in my childhood I probably would've developed a strong, imposing personality too.

&amp;nbsp;

A year ago she had a freak accident where she fell down the stairs and broke her back which left her paralysed from the waist down. This threw the whole family into turmoil. She was in hospital for 5 months and the drive there was more than an hour. Her husband went to see her every day after work and my partner and I drove up there as often as we could (once or twice during the week and every weekend).

&amp;nbsp;

It was a rough time for everyone. My partner was stressed and worried all the time. Especially after every visit as his mother was always very depressed (understandably!!) but on occasion she said things I thought were out of line for a mother. I'm not a mother myself so I find it difficult to relate so this is something I'm looking for advice on. She used to say to my partner ""If I don't learn to walk again I will commit suicide.""

&amp;nbsp;

Now of course I understand her situation was exceptional and I can in no way relate to the way she felt but regardless of that it really messed with my partner. He has a very stressful job too which didn't help. I never dared bringing it up to him though because I didn't know how he would react and how he felt about it.

&amp;nbsp;

There were other situations where I thought she could've just kept her mouth shut but they were by far not as bad. She got hysterical with her husband when he brought her the wrong clothes. She got angry with me for not painting her nails perfectly. She frequently got into arguments with the nurses and other hospital staff. I put all of that down to her difficult situation and I still don't blame her for it. But I'm thinking now that I should've seen it coming because of her behaviour in the hospital.

&amp;nbsp;

She was scared of being released because she didn't know how to cope at home. I then decided to talk to my boss at work and asked if I could start working weekends to take time off during the week so I could help her at home when her husband wasn't there. I work full time as a manager in a finance related department, we're always busy and understaffed and under a lot of pressure but my boss was very understanding and agreed.

&amp;nbsp;

The first few times I went to see her she had me working really hard. I cleaned the whole house from top to bottom and emptied her extremely cramped wardrobe to sort out all her clothes, throw away what she didn't want anymore and put all the other stuff back in neatly. It took 2 whole days, that's how cramped it was. After all the ""big jobs"" in the house were done I cleaned the house every time I went to see her, did the laundry and helped her with her exercises, made her tea and ran errands.  

&amp;nbsp;

This went on for half a year and I honestly could've dealt with it all if it hadn't been for her complete lack of appreciation. I never got a single thank you, not even a smile. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect her to kiss my feet and tell me how grateful she was every time she saw me. I honestly thought though that our relationship would improve. I expected her to start liking me as pathetic as it sounds.

&amp;nbsp;

To give a few examples of the way she treated me throughout the whole time: 

* My granddad was diagnosed with dementia and didn't recognise me anymore. I was very upset and when I told my MIL about it she waited until I had finished my story, looked at her watch and said ""Let's go now, we'll be late for my appointment."" (we were far off from being late)

* I could never get anything right for her. I had to make the bed twice because I didn't put the pillows down the way she wanted. Another time she asked me to clean the bathroom all over again because I didn't use the cleaning product she preferred. The other times where she didn't ask me to do something over again she mostly looked unimpressed or pointed out that it could've been done more thoroughly.

* For a birthday party we all went to a restaurant for dinner after I had spent the whole day cleaning her house. I was exhausted and we didn't eat until 10pm and didn't leave the restaurant until after midnight. She asked us to come back to their place for some drinks but my partner declined and said he was tired. She then asked me and I declined too saying I was tired too and had work the next day (she knew I worked every weekend so I could help her during the week). She then said goodbye to everyone there with a kiss and a hug except me. Pathetic me went over to her three times to say goodbye and every time she ignored me, the third time she slammed the car door shut in my face. She even hugged and kissed my partner who had declined just like I had.

&amp;nbsp;

I just couldn't take it anymore. On the way home from that birthday party I started crying and ended up telling my partner about it all. I felt exploited and pathetic for wanting her to like me. I was constantly tired from working so hard and missed not having any time to myself anymore. He was very understanding so I ended up telling my MIL I wouldn't be able to see her anymore during the week. I made up an excuse that work wouldn't allow me to take time off during the week anymore. I didn't want to talk to her about the things she did and said because she's a very confrontational person and I cannot imagine a scenario where it wouldn't have ended in an argument. I didn't want to risk causing a situation that would lead to my partner and me not being able to see his family anymore. When I told her she didn't even say anything to express regret over it.

&amp;nbsp;

You'd think I wouldn't care and get on with my life but since then I've been plagued with a guilty conscience. I picture her trying to get her household sorted and struggling and getting frustrated and sad. I feel like I should've been more understanding and patient with her and shouldn't have taken it all so personally. I also feel bad that my partner now doesn't have the peace of mind anymore knowing his mother is being looked after. On the other hand though I can't give myself up for anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Reddit, did I do the right thing?
   
**tl;dr**: I helpd MIL after her accident and she didn't treat me nicely so I stopped and I've felt guilty ever since.

**EDIT** 

Thank you so much for all your responses.  At one point I couldn't keep replying anymore but I have read every last one of your comments. I love this sub, you guys are great. 

It really calmed me down getting such overwhelming support. It has also been a very good lesson for me to work more on myself. Grow a backbone, learn to stand up for myself and make sure I'm happy before I try and please others. 

I already said it in one of my comments but I used to be even worse in that regard and already changed quite a bit over the last few years but you made me realise I'm not done yet and still have some work ahead of me. 

I will update you all at some point to let you know how my relationship with my MIL has developed. 

Lots of love to all of you! "
"I [28F] don't want my nephew [12M] at my wedding because he has Tourette's syndrome.


[removed]"
"My [19M] sister [14F] told me that she has an embarrassing problem that our parents haven't done anything for. I took her to see a doctor and parents are upset.


So last week my sister called me and asked me to come over when our parents aren't home and she has something important to tell me. I went there and she told me that it's embarrassing but basically when she goes to toilet to have number 2 it's very painful. I asked if she's talked to our parents and she said they don't believe her. She asked me to take her to the doctor. So I booked an appointment for her and took her this Monday. Luckily her issue is not as serious as it is painful and hopefully she'll be fine soon.

So somehow our parents learned and are upset that I took her to the doctor without their permission. They say this is me interfering with their parenting. That I'm old enough to make decisions for myself but not to make them for my sister. I really think this is dumb. I mean she's 14 so she can technically go to the doctor herself. She just asked me to drive her there and be there because she was a little afraid. I also think it's stupid for whatever reason to not take her to the doctor when she's not feeling well. Parents say she has a history of calling in sick for no reason and that's why they didn't believe her.

So right now she's grounded for going behind their back by involving me and I'm also banned from seeing her for a while because I went behind our parents back by taking her to the doctor without their permission. They expect me to apologize and promise that this won't happen again but really I in good conscience can't do that because if she asks me again to take her to the doctor I will. But I think they're just going to be mad at me and will ban me until I somehow tell them that I was wrong by doing that.

How I can handle it?
   
**tl;dr**: I took my sister to the doctor because our parents refused to, and they're now mad at me that I did and they expect me to apologie and promise that I'll never do it again."

I'm not sure if this is the right place to go looking for advice but I'm at a loss!

I recently started my first real job, (I've babysat, done other small jobs in the past) working as a student assistant secretary in the HR department of my college. 
I started about 1 month ago.
The lady who I'll call my boss, isn't technically my boss, but the secretary I help and work for. Along with another secretary, who has never mentioned anything and has been nothing but nice. 
My boss technically is her boss as well, as she is only the secretary. But her boss is the one that hired me.
My boss/colleagues never mentioned a dress code, so I assumed I should dress nicely, dresses, sweaters, etc.

The 2nd week in I wore a dress that came a little bit below my knees, with a sweater over it and low heels. 
When my boss and I were alone, she told me, ""it's a nice dress and all but it's a little short."" I didn't think it was that short, but I guess it looked short because I was wearing heels. I told her I was sorry and went to buy clothes that weekend that were more appropriate, and were wearable during summer because it gets freaking hot. 

Being my first professional office job and all, I bought some dresses and long sweaters as well as nice shoes. Everything was fine, nothing else was ever said. 

Fast forward to today,  I'm wearing a dress that comes way below my knees, a sweater that covers my shoulders and sandals.

I've worn this outfit multiple times before and she hasn't commented. 

I had left to run an errand and I had come back in and pulled my top up to adjust it because it slipped down to right above my cleavage when I was waking back. (No boobs or cleavage was showing, it was just slightly lower than it should have been) She waited until everyone was out of the office and came over to my desk, and whispered, ""your top is a little too low, it's too reveling for the office."" Mind you, it covers my cleavage, and comes up to right below my neck and I have a sweater on. I apologized again, kind of shocked she said something. She was laughing and said ""it's okay it's just really not appropriate."" Then said ""I'm just jealous"" and laughed.

Ever since the first time she said something she seems to judge me, by looking me up and down every morning I come in. It's upsetting.

So I'm sitting here very uncomfortable wondering what I should do?

Help with outfit options for work? Am I doing something wrong? I thought everything looked okay and was appropriate. I'm confused and sort of upset I spent money on something that was work appropriate and she commented again.

Where do I go from here? 

tl;dr: Boss commented on length of my dress, I apologized, bought new clothes for work, wore something multiple times, then she commented again today."
