"Erm, my girlfriend [22F] has an issue with the fact that I [26M] walk to work - UPDATE

"UPDATE: Me [60 M] with my daughter [19 F], she hasn't had a single friend since middle school and I am starting to get worried


My original post can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l41q0/me_60_m_with_my_daughter_19_f_she_hasnt_had_a/

My apologies in advance, this got much longer than I anticipated.

Hello reddit,

I debated for a while on whether or not I should post an update. On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her.

Soon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy.

We made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography.

Then came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film.

We were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it.

Anyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going.

You guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies. 

I hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet. 

Thanks again reddit.

"UPDATE: me [14f] with school it starts tomorrow and I have no friends in my lunch


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5026qi/me_14f_with_school_it_starts_tomorrow_and_i_have

First off- thank you SO much for all the nice comments and stories of being alone in lunch. It made me feel so much better!

This is a really happy update!

I ate lunch outside today and I was sitting alone when four girls approached me. They had that they had all moved from different states and countries, and asked if they could sit with me. I was prepared to eat alone or approach some people like you guys said- so this was a relief! 

Of course I said yes! And we really hit it off. We walked around the school after we were done and chatted. We made a group chat and agreed to sit together again tomorrow!

They're all really nice and I think we're going to be good friends.

I'm really glad I made some new friends- I'm not that scared of high school anymore!

The only bad thing that happened is I lost my textbook! I looked everywhere for it but it's gone. I don't even know where I left it... I feel awful and hope my teacher isn't mad. :(

But all in all it was a great day- thank you for all the nice wishes!!!

TLDR: lunch went great- four girls sat down with me and we are friends now. Sitting with them again tomorrow. I did however, lose a textbook the same day it was given to me and feel awful... 

Edit: thanks for all the nice comments! I was told not to worry about the textbook and got a new one :)"
"My [20F] family is calling my niece [13F] a traitor because she went to the police and told them what her dad were doing to her brother [14M]


**Was doing, sorry for typo**

Long story short my nephew is an extremely gifted athlete. What I did not know is my brother would push his son to the point he was dehydrated. As the story goes one day after school his sister walked into a police station and told them what was happening. The police went to her house and they found my nephew dehydrated and dry heaving into a toilet.

Fast forward my niece and nephew moved from California to Ohio to live with our cousin [26F]. My family is calling my niece a traitor because my brother is now depressed he can't see his kids again

My Nephew even told me he could not thank his sister enough

Do you have any advice on what to do, because I don't know anymore.

tl;dr: Family is calling niece a traitor "

"My (26/F) boyfriend (28/M) has become suspiciously close to a model (26/F) he photographs, and has a practically naked photo of her as the wallpaper on his phone.


Throwaway account because my boyfriend is an avid redditor. 

He's a fashion photographer. Meaning he works alongside many beautiful women in his profession. Stylists, hair and makeup artists, and of course, *models*. 

This is actually how we met. 

I modeled my way through college and he photographed me, after which we became friends and eventually started dating. We have been together now for almost three years. I've since stopped modeling, but he is still a photographer. Never once in our relationship has he given me any reason to question his fidelity. With the exception of me, he has never dated or even befriended any of the models he has photographed. 

That was, until, Rachel came into the picture. 

I've met Rachel. She seems like a fun chick, the type of girl who draws a lot of positive attention just by entering a room. She's beautiful but her personality really shines through. She makes you feel like you're her best friend when you're talking to her. A very *cool* person through and through. 

That said, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My boyfriend also adores Rachel. The first time he photographed her, he stayed late at the studio and discussed ideas for their next shoot for nearly three hours. He was actually late for a night out with me because of it, but he's always had terrible time management so I didn't think anything of it. 

The lateness has now become a steady, recurring factor in their shoots together. They hang out long after the stylists and makeup artists leave the studio. 

They also text a lot, and he's always smiling to himself and laughing when he reads the messages she sends him. At first he would show them to me and try to include me in on all the fun (without me asking) but he abruptly stopped doing that around two weeks ago. He tilts his phone away from me now when Rachel messages him. 

I'm not the jealous type but if my bf had a history of doing this with the other models, I'd let it slide. The fact that he is *only* like this with Rachel (and me, I suppose) makes me wary of what might have transpired between them. 

Rachel herself has stopped talking to me. We used to communicate and have an easy, casual friendship via IG and Snap chat, but she pretty much ignores me now. Guilty conscience? I don't know. 

The real kicker is, my boyfriend now has a photo of Rachel as the wallpaper on his phone. He's apparently proud of the concept and the editing, and claims it has nothing to do with Rachel herself, which is totally believable, but ... doesn't sit right with me. I told him that and he told me I was being irrational. 

Rachel is single by the way. She and her bf broke up around three weeks ago, so you be the judge. 

I really don't want to fall into the jealous gf trope but what else am I to think? I don't want to make crazy demands and accuse my bf of cheating on me, even emotionally but he really does seem to be fond of this girl in a way that really hurts me. He has other female friends and he doesn't act that way with them. He's capable of being friendly with a girl without flirting or acting suspicious, but with Rachel it's different. 

He has slowly become very attached to her and I feel like I'm losing him. I have expressed this to him a couple of times but he always tells me I have nothing to worry about and that he and Rachel are just ""kindred"" when it comes to photography. The long nights, constant texting, and phone wallpaper mean nothing. Oh btw, she's practically naked in the photo and it wasn't taken for any sort of publication; just for fun. 

Am I being irrational? Unreasonable? How would you feel in this situation? What would you do? 

TL;DR - photographer bf has been growing very close to one of his models and acting dismissive of my concerns regarding their work relationship. He has a practically naked photo of her as his phone wallpaper. Wtf am I supposed to think? 

**mini update:** He and I are meeting for lunch in an hour.

**extra mini update:** He confessed. More on that later. 

**micro teacup update:** I'll give you guys the full story as soon as this post is kicked off the front page. Correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think we're allowed to post updates until the dust has settled on the original. 

In any case, thank you so much for all the advice and overwhelming kindness. I'm kind of a mess right now but I'm lucky enough to have an amazing support system and a clear head. That's all I really wanted out of this unfortunate situation. 


**OFFICIAL UPDATE:** 
 [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zo0cs/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_has_become_suspiciously/)

First of all, I’d like to thank everyone who left a comment on the original post. Your advice, your words of encouragement and support, and even your criticism has helped me immensely. Thanks. Really. 

Second, I’d like to address a few things: 

1. My boyfriend — sorry, ex boyfriend — has never taken nude or even partially nude photos of me. Although I modelled in high school and university, my primary focus has always been stage acting. He took my head shots. That’s how we met. Not that it really changes anything. Just a bit of insight, I guess. 

2. When we were younger and when the relationship was newer, I would accompany him to his shoots all the time. But my own career is very time consuming nowadays. I know of multiple model/photographer relationships where they accompany each other to every shoot, and I’ve nothing against doing that, but I personally would rather just trust that my SO is on their best behaviour. Obviously what happened here kind of squashes that … but I stand by it. If I have to be there in order to make sure my SO faithful, chances are they’ll find other ways to cheat.

3. I’m flattered by the offers, but no, I will not be meeting anyone for drinks anywhere. Sorry for the bluntness, just … yeah.

Okay, now for the good stuff! … or I guess, the bad stuff. 

I met him for lunch Friday afternoon. We went to our favourite sushi joint overlooking the ocean, and I ordered more than I could handle, stuffing my face while trying to decide how to broach the topic of Rachel, but most importantly, our relationship. I went into that meeting with a righteous, ass-kicking speech prepared, but I forgot every word of it almost immediately after we sat down. I guess he could tell there was something on my mind, because he asked me if I was alright, if he had done anything to upset me. *Snorts.* Yes, Ian, you’ve upset me very much, actually. As soon as I gathered the confidence to look him in the eyes, I point blank asked him, “What’s going on between you and Rachel?” His mouth flew open as if he were completely and utterly taken aback by the implication, but I cut him off with, “DO NOT bullshit me.” 

I tried my best not to let anger get the best of me, I really did. I wanted to stay cool, calm, and collected like so many women on this sub. You know the ones. Those intense stories of cheating husbands wherein the wife takes to /r/relationships, garners a ton of support, and then updates us later with a well-constructed, storybook post detailing the evidence she has collected against him and the meeting she had with her Uncle or sibling, who just so happens to be a divorce lawyer … ? 

Yeah, I’m not a badass like that. I wish I were, but I’m honestly just an overly emotional doormat and I knew going into this meeting that I was either going to cry or gouge his eyes out with my mind. Because I had somewhere to be later, I took a hard left and got super, SUPER angry.

He could see it in me, the anger bubbling over. The people in the restaurant were starting to stare at us, too. In order to save face I threw money on the table (with tip) and told him to meet me in the parking lot. If I’d had a switchblade on me, I can’t say for certain I wouldn’t have channeled my inner Jet and beat his Shark ass to the pavement.

Kidding. Totally kidding.  

We met inside my car. He climbed in after me, his head down as though he were ashamed or … I don’t know, GUILTY?!?!?!?!?!

I asked him *how*, and he explained everything to me. No preamble whatsoever. 

The moment he met Rachel he felt some type of way towards her. He couldn’t tell whether it was just a silly crush or something more, but he knew she felt it, too. *How cuuuuuuute*. 

**BARF.**

They kissed the first night they met. The night he nearly stood me up. 

They had CRAZY, **emotional**, *~forbidden* sex the night she and her boyfriend called it quits.

And they’ve been fucking ever since. 

He mentioned he has always used a condom with her, but I don’t care. I’m getting tested. Oh and because so many people asked in the original post, I figure I should mention Rachel was the one who was broken up with in her previous relationship. I don’t know why or how. I didn’t ask and I don’t care to know.

Funnily enough, Ian said he doesn’t want to be with Rachel, he wants to be with me, and he even provided text messages to show that he’s the one who decided not to pursue anything with her on official grounds, but I told him I give zero fucks about what he wants. And unless he can go w/o his eyes, he should get the fuck out of my car and erase me from his mind before I erase him. 

I literally said that.  

In any case, I went home later that day, posted an update for you guys on the original, and drank. A lot. 

My friends and family, and most of Ian’s friends and family, have rallied around me in support. I guess he told his mother we broke up and how it happened, because she called me this morning and said she’s disgusted with her son and that if I need anything at all, she’s always there for me. 

For real, you guys, I’m going to miss his family. They’re good people. The best people. 

This is my first “adult” breakup, by the way. The type of breakup where you’re required not only to break up with your SO but with their family and friends, as well. These people you’ve spent so much time getting to know and growing to love, are suddenly not in your life anymore and it’s … well, it’s kind of daunting, really. Daunting and sad and infuriating all at the same time.

So, that’s the conclusion to this story. That’s what happened. 

Thank you again to everyone. 

If I have anything to add, I’ll do so below.

TL;DR - he admitted to cheating with Rachel and then I dumped his ass.

**note:** To the person who said violence is never the answer and I should never have threatened my ex - *You're right, you are absolutely right, but if you're ever in a situation where your lying, cheating ex refuses to leave your car the first dozen times you asked, I dare you not to lose your shit and say things you don't mean just so he gets the fuck out (and doesn't see you cry).* 

**microscopic update:** So far, his mother, his teenaged step-brother, and two male friends of his, have reached out to me saying how disgusted, ashamed and embarrassed they are on his behalf. On top of three mutual friends. It hasn't been two days yet, you guys.

"[UPDATE!] I (20M) want to ask out a really cute girl (19/20F) in my physics class. She's deaf and I need help on how to approach her.

Sorry I'm late with the update! I've been busy since class on Friday. 

I got to class about 15 minutes early as I usually do. She happened to come in right behind me and was alone at her seat. I had planned to approach her after class, but I figured I couldn't get an opportunity better than this. 

I walked up to her and she smiled and waved when she saw me. I sat down next to her and signed ""Hi, my name is Sam"" and she responded with her name. After that I signed ""Can we mouth talk?"" as /u/lin_zexu suggested. She said yes and we spoke the rest of the conversation.

We are both from the same city so we talked a little about that. I asked her if she was free this weekend and she said she was going back home so we have a date this coming week. We have been snapchatting nonstop since.

Thank you r/relationships for the help in asking her out. Can't wait for the first date(:

tldr: Asked her out. Went great. Date next week."

"UPDATE: My [32F] mom [72F] kept saying my kid was obese. The crazy ran even deeper than I thought.


Hi Reddit. I'm back with an update. Here's the original post. https://redd.it/4zn8ly

Thanks for all the responses you gave me on my first post. I think I needed a dose of reality, and that's what I got. 

After reading all the comments I realized I needed to talk to my mom. So when she came over, before she had a chance to say anything about Leah's eating habits, I took her aside and said ""enough. Leah is healthy and happy, and your weight comments are inappropriate. They stress me out and they're bad for Leah. If you keep making them, we're just not going to see you anymore."" She sputtered a bit, but ultimately agreed to my terms. I was hopeful that maybe she would actually stop making the comments so we could have a somewhat normal relationship and she could continue to see Leah.

Hahaha.

I work a part-time schedule of two days per week and every other weekend. This was my working weekend, so my husband was home with Leah. When I got home after work on Sunday, I could tell something was up. Leah was already in bed, and my husband looked really tense. He's usually a pretty laid back guy, so this was weird. 

When I asked what was up, he said we needed to talk about my mother. I had told him that I had spoken with her and that she had been warned not to make any more comments about Leah's weight. Well, apparently she just couldn't do it, because she called him (knowing I was at work) that day and told him that I was blind to Leah's problem and that he needed to get involved because I had confided in her that Leah's pediatrician told me she was at serious risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and that we needed to change her diet so she would lose weight.

What?!?

For the record, Leah's pediatrician has never said anything like that. In fact, as I mentioned in my last post, he has told me that she is underweight. Fortunately, my husband a) attends all Leah's doctor appointments and b) has the sense to realize that a rail-thin child isn't edging toward obesity, so he knew it was bunk. He told my mom that she wasn't to call again until she heard from me.

Well, I was livid. It was like after years and years of weight-related crap from my mom something finally snapped. I called her and the minute she said ""hello"" I just lit into her. I told her that based on her behavior she was either delusional or a manipulative sociopath, and that either way she wasn't allowed around me or my kid again. I told her she was not welcome to call, e-mail, come over or send cards. Basically, we were going to pretend like she didn't exist. I hung up before she had a chance to get a word in edgewise.

She called fifteen times that night. I finally blocked her number on my cell and my husband's (we don't have a landline so this means she can't call us at all). I had three emails in my inbox the next morning, which I deleted without reading before blocking her email address as well. Finally, we had given her a key to our house for emergency purposes so first thing yesterday I had the locks changed then took Leah out for the day. Lo and behold, when we came home my neighbor said that my mom (she recognizes her because she used to come over a lot) had been banging on the door for almost half an hour earlier that day before storming off in a huff. I can only imagine how angry she was when she realized her key didn't work anymore.

I feel better than I have in years, which makes me think I did the right thing. The only thing I'm still struggling with is how to break the news to Leah. She really does love grandma. My husband and I are going to sit down with her tonight, so I guess I have until then to figure out what to say.

"Boyfriend 30M of 2.5 years, avoiding our (27F) favorite dinner spot, and not going to a movie. This also conveniently happens to be when a girl he's been chatting with on Facebook is going to dinner/movie. Am I totally crazy?


Wow this is a doozy. Sorry the title is kind of a doozy, I'm feeling a little bit crazy and I need to be talked away from the hypothetical crazy ledge.

My boyfriend really likes Facebook. I have had no reason to not trust him 100% with it. He's definitely a like every photo/status kind of guy and just thinks that it is fun. I don't have a facebook, and my presence on his is nonexistent besides the mention of fun things we are doing here and there. I realize now that I could easily be mistaken for a friend/sister/cousin/etc. 

About 3 months ago, I got tipped off from a friend that he had been a little flirty with a girl on Facebook. I did a quick cyber stalk of her and she was gorgeous, and I noticed instead of the typical like he had been ""loving"" and ""wowing"" her pictures. I called him and told him I felt a little bit crazy, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any funny business. He assured me he is just being nice, and they've never met (she is a friend of a friend apparently?) and it is no different then me upvoting something on Reddit. They had messaged a few times but it was totally innocent and looks any flirtations were nonexistent. Ok, I dropped it, but my spidey senses told me to bookmark it, instead of completely discard the thought of her forever.

A new movie is coming out tonight, and conveniently our favorite dive bar/dinner spot is RIGHT across from the movie theater. We just have to walk a few feet or so and there we are. We have both been stoked for his movie, and talking up our date night ALL week.

I was going into a work meeting and texted him ""Hey I'll probably be tied up till after 5, so i'll see you at *name of place* at 7!"" 

He texts me back (verbatim, to show how weird this was). ""Hey umm is there somewhere else?"" 

I don't know what it was, but after a few months of not even thinking of this mysterious facebook enigma, something shouted at me to look at her profile. Her profile is absolutely 100% open, there is no privacy. She geotagged how excited she was to see the movie and go to the bar. Hmm....Ok that is a little convenient. Did a little more digging, he's loved even more of her pictures.

Shortly after, he asks if we can just have a night in (which is weird, because my place is being remodeled and the only access at my house is the bathroom and bedroom, and he just had his fumigated and is staying at his moms). I'm like where da fuh are we staying in at?? I have already bought the movie tickets and I told him that I didn't want them to go to waste so to please come we can go eat at another nearby place.

I just think this is all awfully convenient. Am I being a total loon in thinking he doesn't want his girlfriend and side piece running into each other at the movie/dinner?
  

Update!!!: first of all, you guys rock. It is nice to have an army of wonderful Internet friends. So long story short. After the movie I went to the bathroom and Facebook girl was also in there. I told her I loved her hair and then we were just girl chatting, and I was chatting with her out of the door where my boyfriend was waiting for me. He looked like he was going to faint. I was like ""babe! Meet my new friend!"" He was cheating on me with her. They had been having sex for a few months, and he said he was just in a casual relationship with me. Right a casual relationship with a house being built and joint finances???? Good hell. She told me since I have fake boobs I just wasn't enough for him and that was her justification for being ok with it, because I have fake boobs. It was weird like she knew who I was when we were chatting in the bathroom. So no damn girl power there. He didn't even seem sorry, which sucked because he really was my best friend. I don't make a lot of friends since I'm a trauma nurse and just don't get out much. I'm really sad, and feeling really stressed out and just broken. I also feel yucky, I'll get checked for STIS and all that jazz on monday. Time to fix this heartbreak. I took the weekend off of work. Ugh this sucks. Thanks guys you are all so wonderful and encouraging!

"My [28F] family expect me to put everyone to work only because my husband [30M] runs a successful business.


My husband owns and runs a very successful network security company. It's a small company and we employ highly skilled people. All but one of our employees have masters degrees. About a quarter have PhDs. We've been married for 6 years.

I have a very big family. Six siblings, 11 biological aunts and uncles (18 counting the spouses), 28 first cousins. The list goes on. It's not another month before someone from somewhere is looking for a job and is looking at us, thinking we can provide them. It's never been that we didn't want to put anyone to work, but nobody has ever had the right skills to even work for us.

Our family don't seem to understand what highly skilled work is like. Just a few days ago my aunt (who I love very much) was asking me if I could put her daughter's husband to work. He doesn't even have a college degree but and apparently (according to my aunt) has started to learn programming online since last month. I tried explaining to her kindly that the work we do requires a lot of relevant experience and everyone has graduate degrees and he should apply to more relevant jobs to gain experience. Her response was that he's a quick learner and he will learn everything on the job quickly. That's the mindset we're dealing with.

My husband is tired of this, and I'm kind of tired of this. This is my side of the family so I should deal with them ideally... I don't want to come off as an asshole to everyone so I listen to them and always try to explain things kindly but doing the same thing again and again is frustrating especially as things don't change and they'll say the same thing to us a couple of months later.

I don't know how we should deal with this problem?

"(UPDATE!) My (29F) wife (28F) and I work together and were anticipating becoming business partners with our boss (40M). I got into a bizarre confrontation with HIS wife (40F) and now we need help navigating the situation!


Link (hopefully!) to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50ejbw/nonromantic_my_29f_wife_28f_and_i_work_together/  



Hi all! I have to say, I really am blown away by the diplomacy and sympathy I received with my first post; I really thought this was a pretty mild topic that wouldn't receive too much attention so I'm really grateful for everyone that took the time to comment! Seriously, once I hit 7 up votes/4 comments I thought that would be the end of it!  


I want to clarify and expand on a few details before I dive into the updated situation: First, I have absolutely NO ego about my job.  I'm a freaking waitress! I'm completely aware it's unskilled labor and certainly doesn't take any specific skill to be competent at it.  That said, I LOVE my job. I served and bartended through two college degrees and kept on going afterward- I have a BLAST at work! But I am absolutely aware that my wife is a significantly more valuable employee and were this a simple employment situation, I would happily just move to a new job.


I also wanted to clarify on the owner's wife's interference when I snapped at her.  She wasn't simply checking on tables/refilling water glasses/pre-bussing tables (pre-bussing = clearing empty plates from the table while diners are still seated).  At one point she was standing at one of my tables for about 3-4 minutes (which is a LONG ASS TIME in the restaurant world) talking about: her 4 kids and which ones still breastfed/her mortgage/how much they would lose if the business failed/the application process my wife went through to become the head chef/the owner's wife's own work history, etc.  It was incredibly inappropriate and a really invasive service style. I usually don't even let my own guests know I'm married to the chef unless it organically comes up in conversation! Multiple tables were actively complaining to me about her service style, which led to the (admittedly petty) comment I made to her.    


Anyway, I went in to meet the owner.  I asked our bar manager to be present at the meeting as well (bar manager is a longtime friend of the owner and was present for the initial altercation and the private conversation the owner's wife and I had).  So the three of us chatted for about 5 minutes- I said very little, and mostly took the general advice here of deferring to whatever my boss said (I generally employed three key phrases: ""I understand"" ""You're absolutely right"" and ""I'm sorry"").  My bar manager (with whom I primarily work with, rather than the owner) completely shut down any tense moments by immediately telling the owner that I was ""a self-assured, seasoned server who needed little to no direction"" and that ""(owner's wife's name) overstepped her boundaries in a big way, which led to a pretty understandable reaction from (me).""  The owner pretty much deflated after that; he hemmed and hawed a bit about me being inappropriate (to which I agreed) and then repeatedly told me his wife ""had no problem"" with me.  I cheerfully answered ""great! I look forward to working with her next shift!"" and that essentially ended the conversation.  I did ask the owner point blank if his wife was considered my superior when we worked together; he looked confused and clarified that no, she was considered my complete equal both on the floor and off.  (He also FIRMLY stuck to his guns in being justified in discussing my personnel/performance issues with my wife, a statement to which I again deferred.) 


That was the planned end of my update until a pretty serious conversation with my wife last night.  Prior to/aside from this altercation, there have been some instances that my wife witnessed that really made her question if we should invest with them; apparently our owner has been getting HAMMERED on his shifts (he works alone behind the bar a few days early in the week, whereas I work the later week days and the weekend) to the point where he has: FALLEN OVER in front of guests behind the bar/completely unable to make cocktails (we're an upscale craft cocktail bar)/visibly intoxicated and heavily slurring; generally giving terrible, drunk service.  The breaking point for my wife was TWO 1-star yelp reviews within minutes of each other specifically calling out his service.  One guest had to actually go to the kitchen window to get her own food.  Reddit! It's TERRIBLE! I was completely appalled and upset for/with her, and we both agreed this is NOT the way we want to run a business and reiterated to each other that any potential partnership with this couple wasn't going to happen.  We're both professionally serious people, both COMMITTED to her career goal and neither of us will do anything to jeopardize that.  


Anyway! So we're both on the same page.  We're keeping our savings intact and completely mentally/emotionally checked out of going into business with this couple and generally getting all of our ducks in a row to head back to Vegas so she can get back into some of the top-tier restaurants out there.  Our lease is up in November so we'll just ride it out until then.  Reddit I really appreciate the attention this query received; I really felt a bit unmoored with how to handle it and I'm glad that you all essentially told me to follow my instincts and play it safe/close to the vest.  That's it! Thanks everyone!

"I [26 F] just can't keep my two teenaged brothers [13 &amp; 14M] I took in anymore.


I don't know how to live with myself honestly. I just can't do it. It's been 3 months. My parents died a year ago. They lived with other family for a while and it didn't work out either. I'm about to lose my job and my husband and I are divorcing over it. They only ever really listened to him and I can't do this by myself. I'm so overwhelmed and there is nowhere for them to even go to give me a break. I'm on a family vacation I paid for us to take right now and it all came to a head today (as it does nearly every day now) when the younger one ignores me and takes off. 

The younger one won't listen to me at all. He ignores me almost all the time or throws fits. Gets in trouble at school, won't help do anything around the house unless I spend an hour fighting with him. He's a loving sweet boy but he needs more help than I can give him. 

The older one is really trying and seems to understand the gravity of it all. I think it could work out with him but how can I put one in the system and not the other? We can't afford military or boarding school, ESP not on just my money, ESP not if I lose my job and there is only the state money they have. I'm already going to have to trade in for an older car as it is and that's with me still having a job. 

There is nowhere else for them to go. No aunts, uncles, grandparents, family friends, etc... I'm the last one and I am so overwhelmed I'm having a mental breakdown 6 out of 7 days of the week. I can't provide for them anymore, I'm just too beaten down. 

I've tried so hard. I've gone to all the school functions, been involved with all 14 teachers, making them healthy food, helping them learn to do laundry, getting them to/from sports and school several times a day, staying up to work on homework, etc... I've put my absolute all into this and it's torn my life apart and I am just incapable of doing it anymore. 

I don't know how to even begin finding foster homes for them and I feel like the scum of the earth. I've got health issues I can't address with all I have to do with them and no having help from anyone else it's too much. I don't know how I'll function normal with a divorce and suddenly having teenagers to manage that won't listen to me. Even before this when things were stable more than not with the kids I was breaking down, now I don't even know how to manage it. 

What do I do? I feel so guilty but I risked everything and lost my marriage, facing losing my job, and I find it hard to even want to go on but obviously I have to as the boys have no other family. I'm a dried up, worn out, shell of how I used to be and there's no way I have another 5 years of this, all it took was 3 months to get to this point. 

Tl;dr: Took in brothers 3 months ago. Facing divorce, my job performance is critically bad and I'm facing termination, and I can't do it anymore. I've tried so hard but I'm in full melt down mode after putting every ounce of time and effort into this. I feel so guilty. No idea where to start as there is zero other family alive."
"My [28 F] nieces [10&amp;15F] moved in 6 months ago. Husband [33 M] wants divorce over them and me not being open enough to threesomes after all he's done for me.

"My [19M] girlfriend [19F] of 6 months has a problem that my sister [17F] is technically an adopted cousin.


So she was adopted by my uncle and his partner (two dads). My mom helped them raise her a lot and she was her female role model as she was growing up. Three years ago, my uncle and his partner died in an accident and my mom adopted her. I always loved her like a sister and after she was adopted we just started calling each other brother and sister. She calls my mom, mom too.

So my girlfriend was talking to her and I was there too. At that time she didn't know any of the above. She just thought we're biological siblings. My girlfriend mentioned that she looks more like my mom than I do. My sister answered that we're technically cousins and our mom isn't her biological mother, she's her aunt. My girlfriend said something like ""even so, you still have probably have a lot of the same genes"" and my sister said she was adopted so they just look alike randomly. I remember my gf saying ""oh so you two aren't even biologically cousins?""...

So yesterday she tells me that she it's weird that I'm close with my sister when we're really adopted cousins which really means just friends. I was a little shocked and told her that she's family, not just a friend. Our lack of biological connection doesn't matter at all in my opinion but she thinks it makes a huge difference because we don't have the safeguards that evolution has put in place. I don't even know what that means. She ended the conversation and asked me to think about it. 

All I can say is what the hell? What does she expect from me? Tell her that my sister isn't my sister? What should I say to her?

"My [35F] Niece [16F] always jokes about how her mum [40F] used to beat me up. Doesn't know it was actually serious abuse


UPDATE -  sorry can't change title

Original thread [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ybnur/my_35f_niece_16f_always_jokes_about_how_her_mum/)
  
THank you so much everyone! I never thought I'd ever need advice here myself, even though I felt confident about asking because I read this subreddit whenever I wander over to reddit and found people to be measured and supportive, sometimes to my surprise. Thanks again.

There's a bit of an update (nothing dramatic). But first I just wanted to clarify a few things. Apparently I caused some confusion about the terms I used. Sarah is the daughter of my mother's sister. My first cousin. Where I'm from, we don't have a word for 'first cousins'. We call them sisters/brothers etc. So I refer to Eloise as my 'niece' because that's the term we use. I know what cousins are in English, but I didn't know about the 'once / twice removed etc' . I speak English well, but complex genealogy in English goes over my head.  Sorry for the confusion.

Second, after all these comments, I started doubting myself a little bit (even though previously I was 100% sure nothing was going on abuse-wise in Sarah's home). I had a few conversations in depth with my other cousins and sisters. We know Sarah has mental problems and they are a lot closer to her than me (we don't talk outside these family trips, even then it's smallest of small talk, despite my forgiveness).

THey are certain that Eloise is 100% the golden child as someone termed. I'm convinced that Sarah in her craziness, has clung to Eloise as her beacon of hope or maybe as an extension of her past dreams. Or maybe to make up for her shitty parents who just left Sarah behind when she was young and injured. 

I honestly think the only thing that keeps Sarah from being institutionalised, is Eloise. We are grateful that by some stroke of luck, ELoise didn't turn out to be an asshole, considering how spoiled she is. 

She has complete freedom to do whatever she wants for the most part, large allowance for a girl her age (Sarah is not rich by any means, just the greatest proportion of any free money is spent on Eloise. Also I know she sacrificed a lot for Eloise. There are rumours in the family that she used to be a call girl in order to get her into a good school. But it's just rumours from third parties. I don't believe it, but I don't have trouble believing she would do that and more in a heartbeat if it was necessary for Eloise). 

THe girl is nearly perfect (when she isn't going on about designers or some kardashian thing). She doesn't act out, stay out late (even though she can), is so prudent with money, she can indulge her designer fetish regularly while buying me and her favourite uncle super thoughtful gifts. She gets excellent grades and has lots of friends. She is very open, to the point of oversharing and I have been obsessively looking for red flags since I met her.

I'm convinced Eloise is safe with Sarah. 

However I'm a little worried about their relationship when Eloise goes to college in a few years though. I've advised Eloise to move out to dorms in college and maybe go to study in America (I offered to help pay for it), because she's young and adventurous. I worry Sarah might cling to her a little bit or maybe go off the rails when she finds herself in an empty house. But my priority is Eloise and making sure she doesn't miss out on opportunities just to keep her mum sane.

I will never understand how someone so mentally unstable can produce such a well put together child. 

I know Sarah was 16 when she did what she did, disrupted from a young age and having suffered some quite insane trauma when she was really young (sorry, it's too specific to even put it in vague terms, it was really a big deal), but I know she has changed a lot in some ways (no aggression, no more confrontations with relatives etc). Maybe she's on medication. She did seem a little sedate these last few years. But considering she apparently doesn't feel remorse about what she did to me (because she casually brings it up in family discussion - albeit a crazily sanitised version). 

All I can hope for is that she keeps it together for another two years the way she has. I will keep an eye on Eloise and maybe try to be close to her in adulthood too.

As for talking to ELoise about the jokes. The advice ranged from telling Eloise to stop in very vague terms to demonstrating it to her using a model of the stick I was beaten with (ahem, yeah no). I had decided I wasn't going to traumatise her and she loves her mother dearly, I didn't need to mess with that either. 

If she's ever in danger, I have no problems bringing every detail up to her and the police if necessary. But for now she's a happy kid who loves her mum and the only drama in her life seems to be on TV. 

I had a skype call with her. Just our regular chats if we see each other online. 

I wasn't going to bring it up to her unless she made another joke. But she's quite smart and has noticed that I was a bit off last time we talked and she asked me what was wrong. SHe had no clue it was her jokes that made me uncomfortable. I just said a combination of what pkalef and Megatrain suggested. Esssentially that jokes about what happened between her mum and me brings up painful memories and I don't like it being brought up. Told her that I know she's joining in the family spirit, but I would like it to stop. She was immediately upset. She had never done any wrong by me before and I quickly reassured her by saying it wasn't her and she had no way of knowing. She asked me what really happened and I said I'm invoking aunty privilege and to just let it go. SHe said she would. I made her promise absolutely not to bring it up with her mum. It's the only way I can feel comfortable coming back to the country to visit, Things have to stay as they are. SHe promised. 

She also had been wondering over the years if there were ever issues between me and her mum, as I never stay at their house, but always at my sisters or other cousins. I said ""yes, there are issues, but we can manage to be friendly."" We talked some more. I asked her if she ever had problems with her mom. 

She said yes of course. Sometimes she won't let her do things and she described a few things (like get a tattoo or go to Thailand alone with some girls - yeah wtf, of course not). There were others, all of them inane. I asked her if Sarah ever did anything that worried her. She said no, and that she knows she has a good mom and she can talk to her about anything, she knows other girls who can't do that or that it's rare for girls to be so close to their moms. So she's grateful.

She talked some more. Said I was her favourite relative (hell yeah, suck on that previously favourite uncle!). Then she added, ""I promise not to tell her, but whatever mom did, I'm sure she's very sorry she's hurt you. You know she likes you a lot, she's always proud of what you've done in [other country] and that I should be more like you"".

I like to think I kept a poker face at that one. I just said 'sure' and we said our goodbyes for the day.

So there you have it. Not much of a big update. Thanks everyone for helping me put it into words.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Re-examined any clues Eloise is abused. Convinced there's none. Will continue to keep an eye out over the years. Suggested Eloise leave home and study abroad in 2 years. Think Sarah might get clingy or fall apart afterwards, but who cares. The difficulty with her jokes came up during skype call. Said it caused painful memories and didn't want to talk about it. That's all. She promised not to ask her mom about it. She thinks whatever must have happened between us, her mom must be very sorry. I lol'ed on the inside."

"My [17F] teacher [50s?M] has been saying some weird stuff and my parents [35/38M&amp;F] are PISSED


So this year I have to take a physical science so I can graduate since I didn't pass freshman year. My teacher seemed cool at first, he was funny and made the class alright but he was an asshole right from the beginning. I should mention this is an ED class (I was in and out of psych hospitals for suicide attempts freshman and sophomore year which is why I failed so I have an IEP) so there are like 5 other kids. He was a dick to all of them, basically implying that they're stupid (some girl answers a question correctly and he goes ""wow, look who took their smart pills today."" Or ""put your thinking caps on. I know some of you have misplaced them so you can share."" ""This object is iron, like the plate in [Name]'s head"") and is just really rude. For some reason I was his favorite though, I gave like two correct answers on the first day and he acted like I was a genius. 

It got weird when he asked us what we wanted to be after school. I said I was considering mortuary science school, and he literally started calling me Morticius which isn't even a fucking word. He refused to call me by my name and would make up weird rhymes like ""Morticius so Delicious"" which was freaking creepy. 

I got contacts a month ago, and he would talk about how I was so much prettier with glasses and he preferred them and the contacts didn't make me look right and blah blah blah. One day I had had enough and was literally like ""why are you commenting on my physical appearance? You're a teacher."" And everyone went ""ooooooohhhh"" and he was like ""I don't have a response for that"" and laughed and went back to the lesson (he was talking about me in the middle of a lesson). I was pretty sick of being the teachers pet for no reason so I switched to a different teacher. When my counselor asked why I told her all of this and she was visibly upset and asked for his name and said she would talk to him. Apparently she called my mom because my mom was FUMING when I got home and my dad wants to kick his ass. 

I think the counselor already handled it but my parents want to go down to my school and make a scene. I don't want them too, it isn't a big deal since I switched out and I don't think it's fair to make someone lose their job because their an asshole and I don't have to deal with him anymore so I'm unbothered. Should I keep telling them to leave it since the counselor handled it or let them go to my school?

Tl;dr science teacher is creepy, parents are out for blood but the counselor handled it. What do?


Edit just wanted to let everyone know I'm reading all of this I'm in school rn and I will answer later 


Edit 2 so I just got home and wow thank you everyone! Its good to know I did the right thing. But everyone is calling me brave and stuff when honestly I accidentally said the first thing that popped in my head. I'm glad it worked at lease. I guess I need to tell my parents to go to the school board because you guys are right, some of the kids in his class are little freshman and don't deserve the way he treats them. He's really really rude. My problem now is ever since the counselor said something to him I've literally been scared to pass his classroom. So our school is set up by alphabet and numbers up to 10. So his room is G5 and my 5th period class is G3 and I don't even want him to see me. I guess that says a lot. I'll probably make an update when my parents talk to the principal or whoever. Thank you all so much, you've helped a lot! ❤️❤️"
"[UPDATE] My (28F) autistic husband (27M) is making me miserable and I feel conflicted about leaving him

"My husband [32M] of 4 years expects me [30F] to visit him on his lunch break and have sex with him several days each week. I just can't do it anymore since I had our baby, but he doesn't seem to understand.


My husband and I have always had a very active sex life. It was that way when we first started dating 9 years ago, and that part of our relationship hasn't changed. Still more often than not we manage at least once a day, but many days its more than once. I only say this because I think it's important for you to know that my husband has a very high libido. This is why we've always met over our lunch break for sex for the past 6 years (basically since we moved in together). 

My husband was the one who first initiated this, and it really has always been more of his thing. It's not that I don't enjoy it. It's just I always feel so rushed that it's not so enjoyable, but my husband says it helps him be better at his job and manage stress levels so I've always been happy to keep meeting him over lunch. We've always met at our home for privacy sake; this is an important detail. 

I just recently (3 months ago) gave birth to our first child. I was working before and during my pregnancy, but my husband and I agreed that I would take this year off and just be a mom. 

Even during my pregnancy we kept up our lunch routine. Except for days where I had bad morning sickness, we would met every single day of the week on our lunch breaks, but ever since we resumed our sex life a few weeks ago, I've avoided meeting my husband during his lunch break. 

Lately I just haven't felt very sexy, as I'm still recovering from giving birth and my body isn't what it was before pregnancy. I'm still just not enjoying sex the way I did before or even during my pregnancy and that adds to everything I've been feeling and my tendency to try to avoid it now sometimes.

For another thing, I also don't know what I'm supposed to do with our baby. My husband has asked me to come to his office instead of him coming home like we used to do. He thinks it would be more convenient since apparently he thinks I'm not doing anything all day and have loads of free time to travel across town to visit him, not to mention that he also seems to think I can just ask my mother to babysit or find someone to watch our son that easily each weekday for over an hour. I really don't understand why he doesn't get the fact that it just isn't feasible for me to travel to him alone right now or leave our son for that long. Plus I've told him that I'm just not comfortable having sex in his office, and there's no way I would be. 

To be honest, even when he has come home lately, I just haven't been in the mood. I've tried, but it's so much harder with a baby around that always needs me. We're still having sex almost every day, but my husband has been so irritable and hateful lately because our frequency is down a lot and I haven't been having sex with him on his lunch breaks which he feels he needs to be productive, and his attitude only makes me wants sex even less. 

He's putting so much pressure on me right now to have sex more often with him and specifically on his lunch break that I almost dread being around him or seeing him now, because I know the first thing he will try is to get me to have sex with him. 

I've tried every way I can think of to explain my perspective and my feelings, but he doesn't seem to understand or care. He'll promise to stop pressuring me, but it seems like the next days or even a few hours later he'll go right back to pressuring me to have sex or nagging me about visiting him on his lunch break. Sometimes it makes me want to cry because it makes me feel so awful. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like he hates me or at least resents me because I can't satisfy his need for sex right now. Please give me some advice or tell me what I should do. 

NOTE: I just wanted to thank you all for commenting and trying to help me. After reading through your comments and responding, I've realized that this isn't a healthy relationship for me or my son right now, and I've decided to temporarily move out of our house and into my parents while my husband and I work on these issues in counseling. It makes me sad to have to do this, but I just don't think I can keep living the way we have with no help and a partner who doesn't care at all about my needs or wants.

  **tl;dr**: My husband and I used to have a very active sex life before I gave birth which included meeting for lunch to have a quickie. My husband now expects me to travel to him for the afternoon quickies even though I don't really feel like it and it's almost impossible for me to find someone to look after our son. In generally, he's been putting so much pressure on me to increase the frequency of sex to what it was before the baby. I feel like no matter what I say he doesn't understand or care, and I'm at my breaking point. His pressuring me is really wearing me down. I need some help. "
"Me [28 M] with my wife [27 F] 6 years, i caught my brother [18 M] peeping on my wife in the shower i threw him out and now my family is getting mad at me. is it okay to cut them off?


[removed]"
"My [35F] husband [36M] recently gave me an ultimatum. I think I made the wrong choice.


Throwaway just incase he creeps on my account. 

My husband and I have been together 5 years, married for 4. We've had a pretty stellar relationship despite his insecurities. He has trust issues due to past relationships and his upbringing. During the first few months of our relationship I wasn't sure we were going to last as he would project all of his insecurities into me. I am naturally bubbly (for lack of a better term) and a social butterfly. I enjoy being around my friends whom I consider a second family (I'll explain this bit soon). He is not so much a social butterfly and prefers to be home with as little contact with humanity as possible. Because of my nature, if I could ever get him to go out with me, he would constantly accuse me of cheating, despite my being by his side the entire time we would be out. I am an open book and he has access to every single one of my social media accounts including my texts and emails. I am a tad ""flirty"" I admit but harmlessly so. I have never and would never cheat in a relationship. He knew this about me before we ever started dating and accepted it. 

On to the issue.. there is a gaming convention I have attended every year for the past 17 years. It is a HUGE part of my life. The friends that I have made because of this convention are friendships that I love and cherish. We only ever get to see each other and be in the same place at the same time this one time of the year, over a long weekend. Then it's back to our regular lives in different states and trying to keep in touch through Facebook. Because of this we treat it as a huge party and live it up for the weekend. Nothing ever too wild. We drink, we play video games, and just enjoy being with our friends. My husband has attended with me in the past but after talking with me about it, decided it wasn't for him but assured me that it was fine if I continued to attend. I have attended without him for the last 2 years. On my own accord I make sure to let him know what I'm doing and where I am within the convention at all times and I FaceTime him at night during it before I go to sleep, just to keep his mind at ease. 

This years convention we couldn't afford for me to go for the entire weekend but it's a close enough drive for me to go for a day and return home. I asked him if he would have an issue with this and he assured me he didn't, so that is what I did. I went for the last day of the event just so I could physically see the friends I had not seen in a year and hug them in real life. It was fantastic to see everyone although I left heavy hearted feeling like I didn't get to spend enough time with them. 

The day after, my husband started texting me while he was at work. Saying things like ""I'm glad you could have fun while I work my ass off for us and haven't had a vacation in 2 years."" and ""While you're off with your friends, I'm left home to take care of the kids."" He is a mud logger and gone for weeks or months at a time, while I stay home caring for the children and attempt being a full time online student to further my own career. He confused me so I tried to inquire further into what was bothering him and he finally told me. He has never been ok with my attending this convention, even with him being there with me. He just said he was ok with it in hopes that one day I would stop going. Instead (as he said) the week of the event he would be pissy and passive aggressive. He's always kind of pissy so I never really noticed. He said he hates it and can't stand that I keep returning to it. I tried to plead my case. It's not so much about the convention as it is the people. I cherish the friendships that I have made there over the last 17 years and they are all like an extended family that you only get to see once a year. It's more about the ""family reunion"" than it is the event itself. I don't know what prompted it but he told me I needed to grow up and no one has friendships like that. 

He gave me an ultimatum. Give up the convention, the 17 years worth of friendships, and remove them all from my life (as in deleting them from social media) or him. I was completely dumbfounded. I love my husband so of course I told him that I would give it up. That seemed to have made him happy but I've been a bit depressed ever since when the realization started setting in that I would never get to see my friends again and he literally asked me to throw away years and years of friendships. Am I wrong to consider changing my mind? Am I being unreasonable? 

TL;DR - husband asked me to give up something that has been a huge part of my life for 17 years including giving up the friendships I've made through it. I told him I would but now I kind of regret it and don't know what to do. "

"My [24M] wife [22F] had an affair while I was away for work. We decided to move past it. Now she's pregnant, and we can't agree how to proceed.


**EDIT 2 (Update): I've spoken to a good friend and attorney about it this morning, and he has offered to represent me and work with me on cost. I've decided to move forward with initiating divorce. As I've said, I have forgiven her what she did. But I've also realized that forgiveness doesn't mean that it would be healthy for either of us to remain in the marriage. I can't raise this child. I don't blame the child, but I know that I would resent it every day. Even if my wife agreed to adoption, I know that she would resent me for pressuring her to do it. The fact is, she has made her choice emotionally. We both know what she wants the outcome to be, and the best thing I can do for both of us in the long term is to stick to my guns. If I'm able to get an annulment through the church, fantastic. If not, so be it. I've got a hard time believing that God will not forgive me for this. For now, my attorney has advised me not to tell my wife and instead to collect all evidence I have of the affair first. I'd like to believe that my wife wouldn't try to destroy the evidence, but given what has happened and what is at stake, I'm not going to take the chance. I'll speak to her some time this week, and will ask her to leave.**

I am going to go ahead and see if I can meet with an attorney tomorrow and find out what I need to do to ensure that I won't be financially responsible for the child. I expect that she will probably be angry and see this as some sort of power move to force her in to adoption. It's clear to me that I could not be happy raising another man's child. It's just too much to ask. I plan to talk to her and tell her that, while I forgive her for the adultery itself, the marriage is doomed. We're at an impasse where one of us has to lose in order for the other one to win. There is no ""half baby"". It's all in or all out. Moreover, it isn't fair to deny the father's child a chance to know he is a father or the child a chance to know who his father is. I don't personally fault him for what happened. I don't know him, he doesn't know me. I question his morals in sleeping with a married woman, but it isn't as if he had any duty or pledged loyalty to me. Its my wife I should be angry with if anything. I can't even manage that. I just want to get this over with and move forward. Thanks again everyone**

I guess I’m looking for advice just as much as a chance to vent. Sorry if this isn’t the place for that. My wife and I have been married for two years, together for four. I work on a river barge, so I spend about a month away from home at a time for work followed by two weeks off. I’ve been doing this for the last year since I got laid off from my other job. I just got back from a job, and found out that my wife has been having an affair with an old boyfriend that recently came back to town. I asked her how many times, and I wish I didn’t. She said she wasn’t sure and that it had been a continual thing. They started talking on Facebook a few months ago, but it had only been “innocent” catching up until this last time I left. This time, they agreed to meet up, and had basically been sleeping together all month while I was away. She said that she had planned to end it when I got back, and knew she had to come clean. She let me look at her Facebook message inbox and text messages for proof, and the messages were consistent with her story and timeline. 

My initial reaction was that the marriage was over. I felt betrayed, hurt, and didn’t think I’d ever be able to trust her again. I work my ass off so that she doesn’t have to work while she’s in school. I felt like being faithful was the least she could do for me. She knew what marriage meant to me long before we took our vows. Both of us are Catholics. We aren’t perfect Catholics by a long shot, but we’re deeply religious. I stressed to her that for me, marriage is a forever commitment. “In sickness and in health” and “till’ death do us part” mean something to me. I told her that I knew I wanted to be with her for the rest of my life, but only if she could promise me that she knew the same thing.

I stayed at a friend’s place for a few days and thought it over. First, I talked to our priest. He reminded me what I signed up for and believed in. Marriage is a forever commitment, and that means being able to forgive and work past problems. He recommended that for now I find work closer to home so I can be with my wife and that we seek marriage counseling either through the church or with a therapist. I also talked to some of the older guys I work with, and it kind of gave me some perspective. A lot of them had gone through the same thing. Some of their marriages survived, and a lot of them didn’t. But all of them agreed that spending long periods away from home at a time can be rough on any marriage, but especially tough for young marriages. I understand that feeling constantly lonely and being by yourself in an empty house is hard.

We talked, and she assured me that she loved me. She promised me that the affair meant nothing to her, that she just felt alone, and that she would cut off all contact with the guy. She understood that she would have to work to earn my trust back, agreed to give me access to her Facebook and to check her phone randomly until I can trust her again. She also agreed to go to marriage counseling. On my end, I’ve agreed to find a local job so that I can be with her and focus on our marriage. We aren’t having sex right now, and haven’t since she came clean to me. I wanted to take it slow getting intimate again, and she has respected that. We’ve been kissing, cuddling, and sleeping in the same bed. More recently, she has been insisting on giving me hand jobs, which I’m okay with. She says she just wants to know that I still want her, and that she wants to please me. I do want her, and I appreciate her efforts. Still, no sex though. It’s not her, it’s me. I still find her attractive, but I think it’s going to take at least a little while before I feel like having sex with her again. I guess I still feel grossed out by the prospect of it. Like she’s “unclean” or something. She understands how I feel, and is okay with it. She offered to let me cheat on her to “get even” or get some physical release, but I declined. I don’t want to screw somebody else. I want to be with my wife, and I just want things to go back to normal. 

Two weeks later, we find out she’s pregnant. Obviously, the other guy is the father. I’m the only person she has told so far. Being religious, abortion, off the bat, was off the table for us. I told her that I want her to put the baby up for adoption. I’m willing to forgive her and repair our marriage, and I can look past an awful lot. What I know that I cannot do is go through every day looking at a reminder of her infidelity and having this other guy intertwined in our lives in some capacity. I can’t do it. I know that probably makes me a poor Christian, but I’ve got to believe that God understands that I’m not perfect and forgives me.

She wants to keep the baby. She says that the other guy never has to know about it and that she understands that our marriage can not survive with him in our lives. But her opinion is that it isn’t the baby’s fault. The baby didn’t ask to be born out of an adulterous relationship. And that we would be unnecessarily causing the baby to suffer by putting it up for adoption. She also says that the baby is part of her, and that she would like me to be able to love and accept the child as a part of her instead of the other man. I understand where she is coming from, and I get that it would have to be terrible to carry a baby and have it growing inside of you for nine months knowing that you’ve got to give it away as soon as its born.

But I can’t do it. I really don’t know what else to say. She has agreed to go talk to our priest about it with me, but regardless of what he says, I can’t see either of us budging on it. My marriage might be over, and all I feel like doing is drinking until I pass out. I barely think about it, but we haven’t even talked to our families about the infidelity yet, let alone the pregnancy. The whole thing is embarrassing and I don’t want the attention. I don’t want people telling me that we’re “in their prayers” but judging our marriage and guessing how each of us failed. I just want it all to go away.

Thank you for reading this. If anyone else has gone through something like this and has had their marriage survive, I’d love to hear from you. I could use some optimism about now.

Tl;dr: My wife had an affair while I was away for work. I decided to forgive her, and felt like things were starting to look up. Then we found out she is pregnant. I want her to give it up for adoption. She wants to keep it. And now I just feel lost and unable to deal with this.

"My [22F] family are going to find out how much money my boyfriend [25M] makes. How do I handle this?


I'm from a small European country and my boyfriend is from the US. We met while studying in London three years ago and now live together in San Francisco. 

To get right to the point, my boyfriend earns a lot of money. He's not from a wealthy background so he doesn't show it off, and because property in SF costs so much we don't live in a mansion or anything. It's not immediately obvious how much he makes just from looking at him. 

One thing he does spend a lot of money on though is travelling. He will always fly first class and stay in disgustingly expensive hotels. I don't mind this (I mean... It is NICE) but it does make me a little bit uncomfortable. 

Where I am from we don't really have incomes as high as my boyfriend's, even the top business executives don't earn what he does, we are not a poor country we just don't have the kind of income disparity you see in the US. We are also very, I suppose humble is the right word. The idea of paying more to be treated better than other people is VERY unusual and will get people talking poorly about you.

We visit my family back home often. We will fly first class and then take a taxi to the nearest town. Then take a bus to my parents house and stay there. I always tell my family we flew economy and took busses all the way from the airport. My boyfriend goes along with this and has no problem staying on my parents couch. 

Now here's the issue. My family (parents, 2 brothers, 1 brother's girlfriend) are coming to stay with us in a few weeks. They are paying for their flighs and will be staying at our house. I didn't think this would be a problem since as I said, you can't really tell how much money we have just by looking at us / how we live. 

The problem is my boyfriend was taking with my brother and his girlfriend on Skype (they share an interest in a specific video game) and my boyfriend mentioned how he travels to NYC frequently for work. My brother and his girlfriend mentioned how they would love to go one day, and my boyfriend suggested making the holiday a week longer and going to NYC. They said they probably wouldn't have the money for that. My boyfriend then said he can put it down as a business expense, get a massive discount on flights and hotels, do some work while there, and everything will be fine. (Common practice in his company, not an issue in itself). 

He asked me, I didn't think and said yes. My brother asked my parents, they said yes, now we're all going to NYC... Fuck. 

Since its paid for though my boyfriend's work it's going to be first class flights for everyone, private drivers door to door, and $2000/night rooms. 

I just know my parents are going to offer to pay for my families flights and rooms. Anything else would be incredibly rude in our culture. Then I am going to have to explain to them that they can't pay because the NYC part of the trip alone will cost more than they earn in a year?!?! 

How on earth do I handle this? I talked to my boyfriend and  suggested canceling NYC or doing it cheaper. He thinks I'm overreacting and that it's one thing to pretend to get a bus but another to cancel / make worse my families trip to NYC? I don't think he understands how most people from my country understand wealth. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend is rich. My family don't know. They are going to fund out. In my culture people talk badly about others who earn that kind of money. 

Sorry for rambling / this being long / poorly written on my phone.

Edit : Just to clarify my boyfriend co-owns the business, he will be paying for everything it just goes though the company to get business rates from airlines and hotels. He's not taking any money from the business and his friend he owns the business with is fully aware. They both do this to varying degrees often."

"Our neighbors' [40s M and F] daughter [18] and her boyfriend [18?] entered into our house while my husband [38] and I [40F] were on vacation, did a bunch of drugs, and now our neighbors are saying that all of this is OUR fault


""Bob"" and ""Karen"" are our neighbors. They have an eighteen year old daughter, ""Terri.""


We were never especially close to them but we always do neighborly stuff for them, like take in their mail if they're on vacation, water their grass, feed their cat, etc. They do the same for us.


Two weeks ago my husband and I were going to go on a weekend trip to Las Vegas to see a show. We have an eleven year old daughter, and she spent the weekend at her aunt's house (my husband's sister). We have a small dog and we asked if Bob and Karen wouldn't mind feeding it while we were gone. They said they'd be glad to, and would we mind if their daughter be the one to do it. We've been acquainted with Terri ever since she was about ten or so, when the family moved into the neighborhood (we moved in around the same time). We had no problem with it at all, so we left a key with the parents.


Sunday when we were on our way back, I texted Karen to ask how everything was at home. She replied back ""fine"" but she needed to discuss something important with me.


When we got home we noticed a faint marijuana smell coming from the garage. We went into the garage and the smell was even worse. At that point Karen and her husband came over to tell us that they had caught their daughter smoking marijuana in our garage with her boyfriend. After questioning her, the daughter claimed that she had found the marijuana in our garage and the temptation was too strong. According to Terri's story, she had been in the garage looking for a leash to walk the dog, although all the dog's supplies were set out on the kitchen for convenience.


My husband and I both informed our neighbors that this story was ridiculous. However, Bob and Karen went on to say that ""they know their daughter"" and that she would never lie to them. Bob in particular got on his soapbox and started to lecture us how wrong it was for us to keep drugs in our house when we have a young child.


I had to squeeze my husband's hand to remind him not to lose his temper but we let them both know that the drugs were certainly not ours and that they had better keep a better eye on their own children, and that Terri is an adult and could face serious consequences if found with drugs.


Bob and Karen smirked at this suggestion and said it was pretty ironic for us to mention the law when we should supposedly be the ones being thrown in jail for ""furnishing drugs to minors"" or ""having drugs within reach of children"" (our daughter).


We once again reiterated that the drugs were not ours and that we would not stand for their accusations any longer.


They left in a huff.


Their daughter had since returned to her college campus and thus avoided me ever confronting her. We asked to speak to her that very day, but they said she was ""too distraught"" and that she had ""suffered enough."" 


I mean, WHAT?!


My husband is wondering how our neighbors ""caught"" their daughter smoking pot at our house in the first place. Was the garage door open? Were they making a lot of noise? Does the boyfriend have a distinctive car, the sight of which caused the father to investigate a little more?


Something doesn't add up.


Just to make it clear, neither my husband and I have any interest in pot or any other drugs. We only drink wine on occasion, at fancy dinners. 


But it doesn't end there. Bob and Karen have started to tell the other neighbors that we are drug users and that their daughter found drugs in our garage and ""you know how curious kids can be, so they smoked it...""


I ran into a neighbor at the grocery store and she told me that Karen had told me about what happened. I gave her my version of events and she tut-tutted me and said it was a shame I was living in denial.


This really makes me angry and upset. Also my husband and I have no intention of moving as we have too much money invested in this house. I am afraid Bob and Karen might even try to tell my husband's employers about this (he works in aerospace), and although I don't think they'll care if he smokes pot, I don't like what it will do for his reputation.


I myself work as a preschool teacher and some of my neighbors are whispering how shameful it is that I am around children when I am supposedly a huge druggy. I know I would be ruined if this reached MY superiors.


What can we do about this? I know my husband and I are innocent, and that Terri is lying to her parents and threw us under the bus, and her parents swallowed her story either because it's easier than facing the truth or they're really just that stupid.


Looking for ideas. I'm catching side-eye from everyone here these days.

"My [25F] teacher is threatening to do a bad social report on my education efforts because I don't want to help another student [28M]. I don't want to help him because he has made mean, inappropriate comments at me. Am I being an idiot or should I stand my ground.


I'm a girl from Scandinavia.
I'm studying to become, well, I don't know what is it called in English but it is something along the lines of an mechanical engineer. The school I go to is small, but pretty prestigious. I'm the only girl in a classroom of about 60 people.

Ever since day one, there's this other student I've had a problem with, or well, he has a problem with me. I'll refer to him as ""Ken"".
Ken has made some pretty inappropriate comments at me and has been quite mean to me.
He seems to think girls shouldn't be doing this kind of jobs. He has never outright said so, it is just the feeling I get from him.

At some point in the beginning of the first semester, our class was in the school workshop doing small projects. Ken and I had been put in a group together. I was drilling some holes into a sheet of wood, while doing this Ken pulled the drill out of my hands and told me he was going to do it instead.
I was pretty mad because, as anyone with half a brain would guess, what he did was dangerous, I could have gotten hurt. 
He kept telling me I was doing it wrong, I wasn't, like it somehow justified his action. Once I moved from my spot to do something else, he muttered ""go back to where you belong"". I don't think I was supposed to hear that.
In the following days Ken spread lies about how I was doing everything wrong in the project and the group constantly had to help me. 

I had episodes like that with him for the most of the first semester. I talked to our classcoach about it, but since none of the episodes was really ever specific enough to really pinpoint as bullying I was told to simply ignore him and avoid him. Which I did.
The following semesters, I didn't really have any problems with him.  We didn't interact much and was never put in any groups together.

Fast forward to this semester, I suddenly get an email from Ken asking me to help him with some of last semesters subjects. Everyone knows Ken did horrible last semester, a lot of people did.
I email him back a simple ""no"". I found out he had been emailing all of the people I was grouped up with last semester, and everyone told him to ask me for help because they felt I was the only one who actually know what I was doing (it is my strongest subject).

Then he starts bothering me at school, continually asking me to help him out. I keep telling him no. He asks me ""do we have a problem or something?"", like he has no idea why I don't want to help.
I ask him ""Are you serious?"" and then starts recounting a few of our previous episodes. He tells me he is sorry.
I tell him I don't know whatever he is honest or nor, but I don't really care. He knew at the time I didn't like how I was treating me and he never apologized. Actions has consequences and now he has to live with those consequences.

The following day my classcoach asks me to talk. He tells me Ken had told him about the situation and that I should accept his apology and help him out. 
I pretty much repeated what I said to ken, that I don't think it is about an apologize, it is about Ken's behavior being unacceptable and my behavior being a subsequent consequence.  
My classcoach said people should be allowed a second chance and once I finished school I would have to learn to work with people I didn't always like.
I said Ken had had plenty of ""second chances"" and that I don't think a student asking me to mentor him was anything like a work relation.
Then my classcoach said, unless I started acting like an adult, I would get a bad social report. A social report is pretty much a small report from your school which is used once you have to find an internship, a poor social report means your chances of getting an internship is poor too.

Now tell me, am I being a complete idiot? Am I being wrong when I don't feel like helping a guy whose behavior has been unacceptable because he suddenly turns around and tells me he is sorry?

Tl;DR - I either have to mentor a guy I hate a school, or loose my chances of getting a good internship."

EDIT: I just logged in and holy...I don't even know what to say. I didn't expect to get some many responses. I'll try and reply, but I just want everyone to know how much I appreciate all of this. I scanned through some of the replies and you guys are awesome. I'm really touched that so many of you shared your stories with me, and gave me all that advice. I'm also a little ashamed for letting those stupid comments get to me in such a way. I'm taking the day off to be with Nita today, and I'll show her all of these comments. Thank you so much.



I'm living a nightmare when this was supposed to be the best time of my life. Our lives. 

I don't know how relevant this shit is, but I had a terrible childhood. My parents tried to sell me when I was 4 for drugs. Yes. I was then taken away from them and bounced through the foster system until I was 15, when I was adopted by a man who already had a biological son and another adopted child (he's the eldest in our family). They're a nice family and they offered me shelter and love.  But I guess I was a little too damaged and I acted out. Had a huge fall out with them and moved out when I was 18. We've reconciled and are on very good terms now, but my point is that I never had a constant parental figure in my life, I have always been on my own. 

Then I met Nita, and fell in love and we started dating. It started with casual hookups and then transformed into a relationship and, basically, she saved me. I love her more than anything. We got pregnant, and it wasn't planned and we were terrified but happy. I knew our lives were going to change, but I didn't see the bad stuff coming.

The first trimester was hell, and Nita lost 15 pounds because she couldn't keep anything down. She was in constant pain and nausea and miserable. We thought, okay, first trimesters can be really awful. This is our first pregnancy and none of use knew how to handle it properly. Near the end of the first trimester, we discovered that she has pre-eclampsia. It was explained to us how dangerous that is, and we were given a list of things to do so we could have a relatively normal pregnancy and keep it at low risk. Nita has been on bed rest since then, going crazy and growing depressed. The only time I see her smiling is when our baby kicks. She's tired and drained all the time, and she's eight months pregnant now. She's getting worse and our doctor is saying we may have to induce labor early.

And everyone is telling me to prepare for the worst, that I can lose them both, that I will probably lose one of them and I'm so fucking terrified that I can't think straight. I'm pissed off. I don't know what the fuck I did to lose everything I love all the fucking time. And I can see how worried and sad Nita is and I don't know how to handle this. How do I handle this? I want to convince her that everything will be okay but I can't convince myself. I don't know what to do, I've been by her side all the time, we both really want a family, this baby, even it's early to have kids. I'm so angry because everyone kept telling us we were making a mistake by having a baby now, and we both told them all to fuck off because who the hell says that? 

We're having a girl that is very much wanted, but I don't know how to make it alright, how to comfort my girlfriend, how to not crumble in front of her and scare her even more. I believe we can pull through this, that it's not as bad as they make it look, but it's like we have an entire world against us and I'm lost. I'm scared I'll lose my girls, I'm scared I won't know how to be a father, I never had one. I'm terrified here.

"I [28F] am thinking of leaving my husband [36M] even though I'm pregnant.


I have always been one to say that I am willing to work through anything in a marriage unless it's cheating, but I am reaching my boiling point and I wonder if I should just leave my husband.

We have been married for 6 years and we have 2 kids, 1 on the way.

He is the most financially irresponsible person I have ever known. Ever.  We always owe somebody. We always get calls from collection agencies.  Unless it's income time, we don't have extra spending if we pay our bills.

Oh yes, paying our bills.  That is always a difficult thing to do with him. He hates paying our bills and prefers to just not pay them until it's too late.  I have like 2 repossessions on my credit because of him.  Yes, I am stupid for enabling him basically.  

I get so embarrassed because he always wants to be borrowing money from people and he is shameless.  I HATE borrowing money unless it's an absolute necessity.  And half of the time he doesn't want to pay people back.  He has basically borrowed money from every single person in my immediate family.  What's worse is that my mom is a business owner and is well off and the minute we fall into a hole, he mentions if we can borrow money from my mom.  

He is a great dad otherwise.  Our kids absolutely love him.  I do love him, but lately I can barely make myself kiss him or even have sex with him because this is an issue that makes him repulsive to me. 

I grew up with parents who were well off.  They would take us on vacations and had us in private schools and basically spoiled us.  I don't even care if I don't have an extravagant lifestyle.  I just want the basics.  I just want to NOT have bill collectors calling me.  I want to know that our light is going to be paid on time.  

He doesn't even pay for my car or my phone.  My mom does.  And she hates him because he still owes her money and is totally irresponsible.

He always pushes me to apply for installment loans, but the minute it comes to pay them, he tells me, ""Can't it wait until next week?""

If it wasn't for me, our light and internet would've been disconnected by today.

We both work full-time although he pays for child support so I make more than he does.  

Our baby is due in less than 3 months and he blew through our small savings to put a down payment for a computer and a tv that we can't afford.  This means I don't even know if I'll be able to have a decent maternity leave because I'll have to rush back to work to provide for us.


I buy groceries so that he doesn't have to buy takeout, but he still finds excuses to buy himself takeout.  Our daughter hangs out with him during the day (he is an on-call locksmith and she is 3 years old) so he uses her as an excuse even though there are ingredients to make sandwiches or a pizza in the freezer.   

I'm just getting totally fed up with all of this bullshit.  I don't even know what to do.

My mom tells me that I should take control of our finances, but when I try to, he still finds ways to spend the little money that we do have.  

I'm an enabler, right?  I just don't know how to keep the peace in our relationship while controlling our finances.  Is there even hope in this marriage?  
  
**tl;dr**: My husband is financially irresponsible and I'm fed up.  Is there hope for us?

SMALL UPDATE- so I am taking my lunch and he texts me that he already got paid and that he has to pay someone back and he is going to be left with $26. Yup. $26. 

I call him and tell him, ""this is exactly why I hate when you do that because you can't even help me pay any of the bills!!"" He could tell how pissed off I was. He said ""what do you want me to do?"" I tell him, ""you are NOT going to borrow anything or pawn anything at all. You are going to give me those $26 and I'm going to handle our money. You're going to give me every pay check you get and you're not going to touch it or borrow money from anywhere."" He did agree... I didn't give him the ultimatum yet because I felt that was something that needs to be done in person so I'll talk to him when I get home.

*******UPDATE******

I spoke with my husband and he did agree to let me control all of our finances including his paycheck... Or he would have to leave. I told him I needed stability to be happy and feel safe.

Thank you everyone who gave me good advice and for giving me the strength to stick to what I needed to say!!! 

Oh and for those saying why in the world did I marry him? Yeah, comments similar to that one aren't constructive in any way."
"My [16M] cousin [17M] made the situation go from 0-100 in 5 seconds when I was pulled over by the police. I never want to drive him again


So I have a twin sister, we are twin brother and sister in our sophomore year. My sister and I are as close as you would expect twins to be, we are going to the same university when we graduate. We never want to be to far away from each other.

After school today I asked her if she wanted a ride home. she asked me if I could pick her up from the mall later, because she was going with her best friend. I normally do drive us home, sometimes she goes somewhere with friends. I give my cousin a ride home almost everyday as well. 


So I noticed this cop was trying to get me to pull over. I pulled over and the police officer got out of his car and walked up to me. I had to show him my license and everything else. I was talking to the cop and he was about to leave. Before this everything was fine, the police officer and I were civil with each other. 

Now my cousin and I are white, but my cousin is dating an African American girl. This idiot let's out the comment "" Thank god we are not black, we would have had 100 bullets in us by now"". Long story short this lead to him calling the officer rude names, we had to get out of the car. My cousin tried to hit the cop and long story short our parents had to come. 

I the entire time was telling him to grow up. He was arrested I was  sent home with my parents. I never want to give him a ride again. not after this stunt by my Aunt and Uncle are demanding I forgive him and see it his way. The idiot could have gotten me shot  

edit: How do I handle my aunt and uncle?

tl;dr: Never want to drive my cousin again "

I was mom and dad's ""little oops"" that caused them to get married.


My dad was really old-school. He worked hard in a blue-collar job in the auto industry but eventually worked his way up to middle management. He died twenty years ago, quite young from emphysema because he chain-smoked. He was only 49. He left my mother a workable insurance policy and she got along okay.  Of course, being his wife, my mom inherited everything.


My parents had two other kids, both girls [38, 34]. My dad was a lot harder with me than with them. I had to work as a teenager whereas my sisters got an allowance.


I moved out of my parents' house when I was nineteen and in my second year of my science major. I got student loans and had my own studio apartment near campus. My dad was proud that I was ""being a man"" and making my own way in the world. I worked while in college at an IHOP and sent several hundred dollars home to my mom every month to help her and my sisters.


Soon after graduating college at twenty two, I got a job as a high school chemistry and physics teacher and that's been my job ever since. I married at thirty to a teacher [now 43] from another school and we have a three year old daughter. My wife has been on hiatus from teaching, but she intends to go back when our daughter starts kindergarten in a couple of years.


My family live in a mobile home. Not a trailer. It looks like a house because, in truth, it is a house, just one that isn't ""nailed"" into the ground with a concrete foundation and all that. Think: one of those Sears ""build-your-own"" homes from the 1930s. We live in a mobile home community filled with similar, portable houses. 


My mom won a substantial state lottery not long after my dad died worth nearly a million dollars. With that money she put my sisters through school. I didn't get any of it but I didn't ask for any, either.


I've never been especially close to my sisters, and for that matter I've never been especially close to my mom, either, which is why I kind of felt unwelcome at home and moved out when I was nineteen. It didn't stop me from sending money home dutifully, but I just didn't have an emotional connection with the women in my family in the same way I had with my father.


Anyway they always like to poke fun at my home and call me a redneck or trailer trash. They knew it made me uncomfortable but they'd still do it. They've been doing it ever since I moved into the mobile home at twenty-five. Like, whenever a picture of my house would be on something I post to Facebook, they'll say something passive aggressive about my home, or insinuate that I'm not being a good provider for my wife. My wife has never once complained about our home—which I bought long before I even met her—and she's told me numerous times that she loves it and that it's all we need.


Since we live in a mobile home that I paid off nearly ten years ago, my wife and I have saved several thousands of dollars. So, while we don't have a fancy home, my wife and I and our child have money to splurge on little goodies and vacations.


With her lottery winnings my mother gifted my sisters lots of money to put downpayments on their houses after they got married several years ago. Each of my sisters has children; the elder of my sisters has two boys [7, 4] and the younger has three [5M, 3M, 1F]. Their husbands both work white-collar professions. 
  

Anyway it seems that my mom has been mismanaging her money recently and has asked each of us for loans to cover her mortgage because she's fallen behind.


Both of my sisters and their husbands begged off saying they have no cash.


Everyone is looking at me now because they know I have money.


It's true I have money but it's for my wife and my child.


My mom is saying I should loan her a few thousand dollars ""just until she sorts out the little mess she's in.""


I personally think there's no need for a seventy year old woman to have a five bedroom house and if she's still paying it off then she ought to downsize to an apartment.


My mom says it's cruel for me to suggest that and disrespectful to my dad's memory.


Um. What?


I also told her that she ought to move in with one of her daughters, each of whom has a huge house with extra bedrooms. My own house has only two bedrooms.


My sisters tell me that I'm the oldest and a man and it's my responsibility to look after our mother.


(Funny, I thought they didn't believe I was a man so much as a redneck trailer park loser, but whatever)


And also since my wife and I sometimes post pictures of our vacations or other purchases (for example I bought a new economy car) on social media, that we must be rolling in it.


And also, that since I have only one child, I should shoulder more of the responsibility to take care of our mom.


I think my mom and sisters are being unreasonable (and SEXIST) and that they should figure out a way from this mess that doesn't involve me handing over my trailer trash money.


What say you?

Hello!

I start high school tomorrow (eeeeeek) and had orientation on Friday, and ever since then something has been scaring me.

I have a lunch not many other people have because I'm taking a class that no freshman take that's making my schedule weird.

I walked into lunch on Friday- and there was NO ONE there that I knew.

I'm really scared. What do I do tomorrow? Do I just sit at a table? How do I know if the people sitting there will be nice to me?

High school is making me really anxious but this lunch thing makes everything else worse. Please help me feel better!

TLDR: I realized I have no friends or anyone I know in my lunch during orientation. This really scares me. Where do i sit? Will the people sitting there be nice to me? High school starts tomorrow and I'm petrified. "
"I [15/F] did freelancing with my friend, and ended up earning an amount of money. Now my family won't stop asking for some of it.


**Update: I really thought hard about every single comment and even re-read it a couple times. I felt bad talking to my family about it - so I let you guys do the job! I sent them this post and they realized they've been unfair and they told my siblings to stop asking and they've given them local job-flyers! thank you guys for saving me from such a weird situation and I can assure you the money won't be spent on something useless!**

For security reasons, I didn't use any personal info.
I hope you don't mind~~

Okay, so it all started a few months ago when I transferred schools. Everything was well and I met a couple of friends that had the same interests as me and we just kind of hit it off. But there was one girl I found was the closest to me (*let's call her elly*) 

Elly was really creative and she spent her time doing everything she found productive -- whether it was sewing, editing videos, cooking, or crafting. I always was around her because she seemed so bubbly and the kind of person who would inspire you to do fun stuff.

She taught me all about social media and soon enough- she even asked me to join in, seeing as this was harmless, we started blowing up on this new app. We started getting a few, then several, then a few hundred comments on our clips and slowly she drifted apart from it.

I just kept doing it because I didn't wanna desert all the editing and hard work we put into our account~ and she was supportive, every once in a while we would laugh about the positive comments we were getting and sometimes laugh too about the hateful ones.

Around a month ago, we earned a following from what we did. 
I got so many emails from so many different people offering to pay me for editing and such. Elly and I thought this was kind of like freelancing, so we occasionally did freelance but mostly we were editing videos.

We would always laugh about how this was kind of our version of lemonade stands and how we were like a pimp business. 

We had all the money that we earned in a Paypal account and we promised not to use it until it reached a 100 dollars. It reached, we screamed internally for a few hours not believing it and I still smile when I think of that day.

We kept doing it, and soon enough we both had enough money **that we earned by ourselves** to buy both of us cheap iphone 5c's 

if you're wondering the price range it's 170$-250$. 

Now the problem.

After telling my family about it, they thought it was cool but now my siblings won't stop asking me to give them some money so they could go ""hangout"" I think they can earn their own money since they're way older than me and can get a job. My parents keep pestering me to give my siblings 10% each week. If I was running this thing alone, I would've thought about it but since me and Elly are running it, I feel like the money should be for us only and should be like an emergency  account.

But it didn't stop to just my immediate family. Now several of my cousins have found out and are begging me to add them to the ""10%"" too.


Am I being bratty and selfish? I don't know what to do and day by day they keep asking more and more. Whatever response I get I'll show to my family in hopes they understand where I'm coming from.

"Me [25F] with my boyfriend [23M] of 7 months, and best friend [21F]: they're going out to dinner together without me and I feel really insecure about it.


I've been dating Roger for seven months now, and it's all gone pretty well so far. We're definitely still in the honeymoon stage, but he's met my family and I his, and we've met each other's friends a few times, although we're still in that wanting to spend a lot of time just the two of us phase.

Now, my best friend Anna is a lot more confident and outgoing than I am. She's helped me get over a terrible breakup where my ex cheated on me, and got me back dating and even encouraged me when I started dating Roger. She's still epicly single, and does make odd 'you're boring now' jokes about me as obviously I have less free time to go out with the girls now I'm dating Roger (although I still make the effort to plan things and attend things with the girls too).

One night on a drunken night out, she told me to tell Roger something, and I told her to just message him herself. She did, and we had a laugh reading his messages to her and it was all very amusing. But this has all carried on. Now and then one or the other of them will say something that lets me know they're still messaging each other, and I just find it weird.

Then, one day I'd suggested that Roger, Anna and another friend of ours all go out to dinner and drinks ones day. This was met with enthusiasm by all. I mentioned it another day when Anna was in a bit of a sarcastic jokey mood, and she joked that she was just going to dinner with Roger herself. She referred to it a few times, calling it their 'date', and making a point that I wasn't invited and they were going somewhere that they could eat tonnes of pizza and cheesecake (I'm lactose intolerant!!).

It died down and wasn't mentioned again and I kind of forgot about it. Then Roger and I were speaking about my birthday next week trying to plan a night for dinner. I'm going out with the girls on the day of, and he had the plans the night after, and when I suggested the night before he said he'd have to check as he'd promised a few folk he'd meet up with them next week. One was an old college friend - the other was Anna.

I'm just feeling very uncomfortable about it. Whilst I don't think either of them would do anything (neither of them are the other's type, even if I thought they'd do that to me), I can't help remembering that Anna has been 'the other woman' a few times before, and whilst I wouldn't, I'm generally very live and let live so it hasn't been somethibg I've considered before.

I don't want either of them thinking I don't trust them. I know fine well that Roger (who has no duplicity in him by the way and can be a bit oblivious sometimes) probably thinks he's just making friends with my bestie. But Anna is purposefully winding me up about it, and it looks like it now isn't a joke at all and they're really doing it and I'm just worried.

What on earth do I say and do in this situation? Do I approach one, both? And how do I not look like a control freak girlfriend?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Best friend and boyfriend have been messaging privately a lot more than I first thought, and what I thought was then joking about going out for dinner without me turns out to be a real plan. How do I deal with this without sounding like an insecure psycho?

**UPDATE**: Wow, this blew up more than I thought it would. Thanks so much for all the advice, I've read every bit of it although I don't have time this morning to reply to everyone.

I haven't seen either of them yet, but when messaging Roger last night I mentioned that Anna has been hurting my feelings with her comments about dating my boyfriend. I didn't go too deep into anything (in saving that for in person when we can speak about next week's plans) but wanted to let him know now that I'm uncomfortable. He did say that that was weird, and that maybe I should speak with her next week when I see her. He didn't mention cancelling, but did tell me I have nothing to worry about and I'm stuck with him.

I know a few people mentioned that maybe they're planning something for my birthday, so I'm going to be careful and not go in all guns blazing. I'll speak to Roger more in detail this weekend - we have a very long drive so good opportunity to speak about how uncomfortable this makes me feel, and whether he's actually intending on blowing me off for my best mate.

I know a lot of you have told me to ditch Anna - but she really is a fab friend bar this one episode, and without knowing what has happened here and without speaking to her I don't want to cut her off. I know she has a moral code of her own, even if I don't agree with it and she has always stuck by her friends before. She has never been an attention seeker, or actively sought to home wreck (although she has done it she doesn't specifically target guys in relationships). I need to speak to her about this. 

I'll post an update after my birthday when I know what has happened and have spoken to both parties. Thanks all!!"

"I [21F] have an eating disorder and my coworkers [20-40] keep commenting on my food.


I've been at my job for about 2 months now and it's going great. My coworkers are lovely people -- they treat me well and we go out for drinks semi-regularly. It's a pretty sedentary job, so I typically use my lunch break to take a brisk walk and eat at my desk. 


I don't see anything truly abnormal about my meals -- pasta with steamed broccoli, a stir fry with rice and tofu, yogurt and granola, fruits, avocado on bread, hummus and baby carrots, a smoothie, etc. whatever. Every so often I'll grab a slice of pizza or some fries from across the street, but bringing lunch from home is more economical for me, and this is the stuff I bring. 


My coworkers will often come by my desk to say hello and shoot the breeze. If I happen to be eating at the time, they will say things like ""Oh my god, you're so healthy!!! I ate a burger yesterday, I'm horrible."" or ""Ugh, I wish I was as healthy as you are."" I've had an eating disorder for a very long time and am still in recovery, and having them draw this kind of attention to my food makes me feel really uncomfortable. I never really know what to say when they do this, but I usually default to something like ""Haha dude, I ate an entire sleeve of Oreos last night."" or whatever. 


The other day we had ice cream at the office and my coworker saw me eating some and he was like ""I didn't know you ate ice cream!"" I just kind of said ""Yeah, ice cream is awesome, I've got a huge sweet tooth"" (which is true). And he responded with ""Huh, wow, I didn't think you ate that kind of stuff. You're usually so healthy."" This made me feel extremely uncomfortable, self-conscious, and guilty.


I'm not mad at them at all -- they're just doing the same thing that mainstream diet culture encourages us to do, which is to label foods as ""good"" and ""bad"" and then praise and guilt ourselves accordingly. The truth is that there is nothing wrong with my foods, and there is nothing wrong with their foods. A balanced diet can include ice cream or a burger here and there, it's not a crime. At the same time, though, I feel really weird having to ""justify"" my office meals by assuring them that I do sometimes eat ""junk"" food (hate that word). I don't think I should have to, it's not really their business.


I've seen this issue come up on this subreddit before, but it's usually rude comments by rude coworkers -- the thing is, these are really nice people, and I know they're not trying to be offensive at all. They probably think there's nothing wrong with what they're saying, which might be true. I recognize that feeling uncomfortable and having an eating disorder is my issue, not theirs. I don't want to create any unnecessary tension, and I really don't want to straightup tell them that I have an eating disorder, because I don't feel close enough to them to share that. This is like an almost-daily thing. What, if anything, should I say / do?

**EDIT:** A lot of people have given great responses on how to gracefully change the subject and deflect their attention away from my food and onto something else. To reiterate what I said in my original post: I know that they are being completely harmless. I know they mean well. I know that me feeling uncomfortable is my problem. Please understand that I'm not trying to tell them that they're being inappropriate and need to stop -- they're completely fine. I'm simply asking for advice on how to make the situation less awkward for myself without being rude or stepping on their toes. Thanks for all the help and advice -- these all sound like good things to try.

"I [28F] appeared on a non-profit charity's billboard and bus-stop ads around my town, and now my relatives are saying that I am a braggart and just looking for attention and to make myself look virtuous


I work part time at a vintage record store and part time as a language tutor (French). I also volunteer once a month for a local charity's pet adoption event.


Basically, we try to find suitable families for abandoned animals from our community. There are often professional photographers at the event, as the non-profit that runs the charity has a devoted website. Once in a while, my face will be in the background of random pictures that appear on the website. I have signed release forms giving my consent.


Not too long ago, one of the professional photographers employed by the company asks me if I'd like to be in a large, billboard advertisement for the charity. The picture, he explained, would be on a few billboards around the city and also adapted as posters for sheltered bus stops.


Basically I would just be sitting there smiling, posing with a group of dogs and cats getting along in one big, happy family. A young man of similar age would be pictured opposite me, also among the animals.


The man told me I wouldn't be paid but that it would be a cool-looking ad for the charity. I agreed to do it, knowing full well I wouldn't be compensated monetarily.


So a few days later I show up to a pet supply store slash pet hotel, and in one of the pet rooms I and the other participant (a nice guy who is a casual acquaintance, a few years younger than me) spend an hour or so posing with animals and having our pictures taken.


And that was that! A few days after that I got an email from the photographers and charity telling me which photos had been selected, and asking me to sign some electronic release forms if I agreed to having my image used. 


I went ahead and did so.


About a month later the ad came out and I thought it looked pretty awesome! A few people from the neighborhood even recognized me and I became, in a very limited sense, a mini celebrity for a while.


But when the charity tagged me on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter, lots of people in my family private messaged me and told me that I was being disrespectful and turning the charity into my own way of getting attention to myself. That, if I cared at all about charity, I wouldn't care about having my picture taken.


Furthermore, a couple of relatives commented on the Facebook photos ""Does [my boyfriend] know you're seeing this other guy?""


I know they were joking (?) but it still rubbed me the wrong way. My boyfriend [26] told me he thought the ad was cool.


Several comments suggest that I am implying I am in a relationship with the man in the ad and it is disrespectful to my actual boyfriend.


Still other acquaintances online have been telling me that I was stupid to have my picture taken because I will now be the target of stalkers and ID thieves. I don't know about the latter, but as to the former, it's been several weeks and no one has stalked me that I'm aware of. Not even close.


Friends of friends have been commenting passive aggressive things such as that I'm a wannabe model or that I think I'm all that.


I'm also getting comments that I am taking attention away from dogs and making the charity about me.


What can I say to these accusations?


I didn't volunteer to get my picture taken. I was asked, and I certainly wasn't paid.


I just feel really bad about what people are saying. Some people are saying the ad looks great, but the negative comments really get to me.


Deep down, YES. I admit it. A small sliver of vanity inside me beamed that of all the people involved in the charity, they picked me to be on the ad. But that was just a tiny reason why I agreed to do it. The real motivation was to bring awareness to the pet adoption clinic and perhaps inspire more volunteers.


I feel awful how it's turning out.


Any advice?


I'm not the greatest in expressing myself (ironic considering my job) in English and am sort of lost on how to respond to the accusations.

"UPDATES My (22F) boyfriend (25M) is unhappy I'm losing weight.


OP: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4z47iy/my_22f_boyfriend_25m_is_unhappy_that_im_trying_to/?sort=confidence&amp;utm_source=mweb_redirect&amp;compact=true



So...wow. This was actually kind of a dramatic. My life is not usually this drastic. 



So I got home from work early the day after I posted my OP. I had told my bf ahead of time that I wanted to talk and he said that he would work hard in the morning so he could finish his work early. 



I felt really nervous talking to him. Blake is basically average in anything, objectively (but of course I think he's excellent), but he's very confident. His confidence has always seemed very genuine, so I really didn't think it was insecurity. A lot of people suggested that. Insecurity about himself, his body, his laziness (which he really isn't), concern that I may be cheating or more tempted to cheat, etc. It didn't seem right. We have a very solid relationship. Neither of us have been even slightly unfaithful. We're usually not one-on-one with opposite-sex, we don't talk to old exes, never been on dating sites, never even been interested in threesomes or group sex. We're very strictly monogamous and I've been clear on my stance. Blake is not the jealous type, never has been, and I'm not the type to wander whatsoever. 



I still went in with an open mind, because I know that jealousy isn't always reasonable. Anyway, we sat down and I said, roughly, ""Blake, I love you. Because I love you, I want to stick around for a long time with you. I've developed some unhealthy habits over our relationship that I'd like to correct. I am going to continue to go to the gym and cook healthy. I'd love it if you were a part of that, but if you're not interested I'd still love your support."" 



He seemed pretty embarrassed the whole time I was talking. Just kinda awkward. He apologized for being unsupported and said said that he really loves me and if getting healthy was my goal, he supported it. So I asked why he was so against it initially. And, well...



He's a fat fetishist. Or a chubby chaser. Or...whatever. He likes big women. He told me that my figure at this moment (which is 5'6 about 210, very busty and hippy) was his absolute dream figure for women. He apologized and said he acted very childishly because he was embarrassed to admit it. He told a few friends a long time ago and I guess one spread word around and he got teased. Plus it's probably not completely okay in this current society to like big women...but I digress! 



I know a few people called it. I didn't write them off completely, but I just didn't really think that was the case. It's...really weird. 
So I asked him some questions. These are all paraphrased, fyi. My memory isn't that good.



Me: so is it like ""the bigger the better""?

Him: no, not really. Like from 200-250 pounds is my favorite. Average height, or tall. I probably wouldn't date anyone over 300 lbs.

Me: did you love my figure when I was thinner?

Him: of course

Me: but you love it more now?

Him: honestly yes, it's my preference. But you still had an amazing figure when we first dated. 

Me: are you going to be angry or upset if I continue to lose weight? 

Him: not really, I still feel bad enough for being such an asshole about it. 

Me: what if I get skinnier than 170ish pounds? 

Him: I'll deal with it. It's a me thing. You're still going to be really hot and I love way more about you than your weight. 



So I got answers and I felt a little better. Initially. We hugged it out and cuddled on the couch with Netflix. He tried to initiate sex but I just...couldn't. It's hard to explain. It's just weird when you realize your boyfriend only dated you because of a physical aspect, you know? He only wanted me because I was chubby when we met. I felt really objectified, honestly. Maybe that's too strong a reaction for a pretty mild fetish/preference/whatever, but I still felt weird. 



Blake could tell I wasn't into making out with him, and asked if I was okay. I tried to explain what I was feeling, but it's hard to. I'm much better at writing than I am talking, and I mean I feel like I barely made sense in the above paragraph. Blake was a little upset. Not at me, just that this problem was arising. He asked me what he could do, and I said I wasn't sure. I probably just needed time before I could be intimate. This was a big thing to hide, you know? I wish he had told me sooner. I don't know. Probably before we had sex the first time I'd want to know. I don't know if I would have stayed or left, but this feels so weird now. Like it's a part of him that didn't exist before and now it's all I think about. 



So now I have these concerns. I do want to keep losing weight. I want to be healthy. But what if Blake can't handle me being thinner? What if he leaves for a woman that fulfills his sexual desires? Will he be unhappy with me losing weight? Will he try to sabotage me?




I brought all of these up to him, and very genuinely assured me that it would never happen. Weight is a preference and he prefers me more than anything. I believe him but I feel like my mind is tainted. Will this just get better with time? I'm not sure how to proceed. I still love him, of course, and want to marry him and be with him. I just feel like there's a block now. 


And before anyone suggests it, HE DID NOT GET ME FAT ON PURPOSE. I was already chubby, already had bad eating habits. The last four years I've been living in dorms, on my own, with Blake, etc and had the freedom to make crappy choices. Which I did. I very likely would have gained the weight regardless of my dating status. 



Is this something I can get over? Is this something I SHOULD get over? I feel like Blake's doing everything he can to assure me he loves me regardless of any physical aspect. But I'm still feeling a little resentful that for all these years he hid something from me, that's ABOUT me, you know?



Tl;dr: bf is a chubby chaser, I feel a little objectified and weird about the whole thing, not sure how to proceed.



Edit: so basically everyone is saying that I just need to get over it. I'm not saying that I won't, it but gets old going through a ton of messages saying the same thing. It mostly feels like people are kinda dissimissing a few things that I've expressed concern with. It's awesome that Blake genuinely loves me regardless of any personal preference. I am not taking that for granted. But it's still something I feel like he's kept from me that he shouldn't have. I have kinks and fetishes that I've been shamed about before, and I still told him. Also a lot of people are focusing on me being a little concerned that he started dating me because he was attracted to me being overweight. I get that physical attraction and types are important. I was receptive to Blake when he approached because I found him attractive. But what kept me continuing to talk to him was his smile, his laugh, his humor, etc. I don't know. I hate that it feels like everyone is saying ""you're overreacting, don't feel this way"". It's been two days and it's at least very weird for me to find out so long into our relationship. Like I said, there's no saying I WON'T get over it. I just need some time. "
