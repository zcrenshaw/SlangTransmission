"I [26M] have from Aspergers and thought I was asexual, Ive met someone [23F] that makes me question everything. Band aid is off


original : tl;dr:Im in love for the first time in my life with my friend, Im not sure what to do as I always thought I was asexual

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lumdd/i_26m_suffer_from_aspergers_and_thought_i_was/



After a lot of thinking I decided I wanted to give it a shot. I was still scared I might lose her friendship but if she was with someone else because I never said anything I would probably regret not saying much more. 



We were watching another episode of game of thrones which we do weekly. 

I was planning on just telling her I like her after you guys advised against the ""love you"" but it also made it hard for me to articulate my feelings


Instead I listed all the things she does that I think makes her unique and awesome. At some point I mumbled that even though she was extremely messy and disorganized she was capable of anything and everything. She looked a little worried  ""if you were my doc Id think you were about to deliver my death sentence why are you being nice, you never compliment anyone, are you feeling okay, dont freak me out"" she started touching my forehead for my temperature and since I was nervous as fuck I was a tomato probably over heating. You could probably cook an egg on my face. 



I suck so I ended up blurting out ""I think Im in love with you"". yeah I realized I F up and said ""no I mean like, like you"" 


She went from worried to confused to humored. She stared at me for a while and this just made it worse as I could tell she was smiling but I wasn't sure if she was laughing at my stupidity or what. She teased me for a bit as to ""which is it, like or love ?"". I said I didn't want to scare her so she can pick which ever she liked. Yeah .... 


So I started back tracking and said she could ignore everything and started apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Thats when she told me to shut up. I dont remember what I was saying but she later told me that I was talking 100k/h and she couldn't make sense of. 


But she she said she likes me too!!!. We didn't kiss even though I really really wanted to but I couldnt get myself to do it. We cuddled instead and talked. 


We've been hanging out every day since then doing pretty silly things. Last night we decided to spend the entire day/night in the city rather than go home. We laid on the grass and just talked/cuddled. 


I told her I was going to kiss her when it was 5 am. don't ask. So we talked till 5 and she reminded me it was 5. So we started this really awkward thing where I kept telling her I'm going to kiss you really really soon but couldn't go for it and kept repeating myself. But then she moved closer and well I went for it. it was just a peck but it was still awesome. She started giggling and I kissed her again. She continued giggling and I told her unless she stopped giggling that I wasn't going to stop kissing her and she laughed harder so I went for more than a peck. It was/is one of the most amazing feelings Ive ever felt. We kissed the entire morning. She said she couldnt control the laughter because she was nervous too, she laughs when shes nervous. So she wasn't laughing at me. 



 So yeah, I think its safe to say Im not asexual.  Part of me felt sad that this was what I was missing out on all these years as nothing compares to it but the other part of me is really happy that it happened with Zara, shes truly amazing.


 OW one last thing! she said she loves me too after the kiss, although she was worried about saying it too early. 


   
**tl;dr**: I ended up blurting that I love her, she said she likes me back we kissed. "
"UPDATE: My [18 M] girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months found out how much I make in a month. Now she expects me to spoil her regularly.


[Part I:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n82kn/my_18_m_girlfriend_20_f_of_6_months_found_out_how/)

Before I start this, Just let me say how thankful I am to everyone that commented. I read everything when I had time, and the advice really helped me with my decisions that followed. 

Last night, I did a lot of thinking, played a lot of Overwatch, and read a lot of comments. One thing that stood out to me most, was to change my passwords, so I did immediately. After that, around 9pm, I packed up everything she's left at my place, (Enough to fill a medium box) and everything she's ever given me. (One plushie elephant).

I wasn't bitter or anything, I just knew that enough was enough and she isn't who she was when we first started hanging out. I drove to her house and we talked before I gave her the box. 

She was very insistent that how she was acting is acceptable, and that ""things were going to change between us"" if we were to stay together. I said I'd rather not, went to my car and brought her the box. I told her she could keep everything I've given her, and I left. 

Later last night, my phone exploded with texts from all of her friends. They called me names, said I wasn't a man, and just generally harassed me. I didn't respond to any of the texts, and instead just went to bed early. 

Work today was a breeze, all my coworkers were very nice and helpful, a girl I've had a little crush on even took me to lunch. (Tacos, hell yeah.) Overall, today was pretty solid. 

She's been calling and texting still, mainly just berating me, (You're not man enough for me anyway, I never really loved you), and honestly I'm glad she did that, because it made getting over her a much easier process. 

When I got home just a little while ago, she was at my apartment. She was crying and asking me to take her back, saying she was so sorry for the things she said and it would never happen again. Now, normally, I'm kind of a push-over. (I was probably hugged too much as a kid, shout-out to my parents) But in this instance, I stood up for myself and told her what she did was wrong and immoral, and that she should just leave. 

She went into anger mode again and started screaming at me. I told her to get the fuck off my porch before I call the complex's security, and she left pretty quickly after that. 

The only real problem I have with any of this, is how little I care about it. Instead, I feel very relieved that she's gone and I don't have to deal with her anymore. I guess my family felt the same, because when I told them, the collective response was, ""Oh thank god.""

The kicker for me in all this is a pretty hopeful one. Me and the aforementioned girl from work have had each other's numbers for quite a while now, and we only used them for work reasons. When I went inside my apartment after telling my ex off, I saw that I got a text from her. The full message said, ""Hey! I know this might be a little forward, but do you want to hang out this weekend?"" I responded with a resounding hell yes, and we made a plan of it. She wants to take me out for dinner, and then go back to her house and make ou-I mean, watch Animaniacs on Netflix.

Reddit, I'm being taken on a motherfuckin' date. This has never happened to me before and advice on that situation would be much appreciated. (Do I put out?)



   
**tl;dr**: Changed my passwords, stood up for myself, dumped her ass and got a date. Feeling pretty great about my situation. "
"UPDATE: Me [36F] with my ex boyfriend [36M] of over 10 years, his wife [40F] has alienated him from all his friends and family and has started messaging me


**[Original post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4infj1/me_36f_with_my_ex_boyfriend_36m_of_over_10_years/) - tl;dr: I think my ex boyfriend is being emotionally manipulated by his wife who is alienating him from friends and family. I want to help him but don't know how.**

Hi, even though my original post didn't get a lot of attention, there were some good responses and I thought I would update everyone as A LOT has happened in the last couple of weeks!

So I forwarded her messages to my ex's brother Fred. He called me immediately and said that he would try to get a hold of his brother as soon as possible. I forgot to say in my earlier post but Bill works as an independent consultant/contractor in IT so it was hard getting a hold of him in his workplace. Frank received a few responses from Bill, just short emails saying he was ok, but Fred wasn't really buying it.

Thankfully I hadn't received any more messages from Fiona (I didn't reply to any of her emails so I guess she gave up on me). I didn't think there was much more that anyone could do so just got on with looking after my own family.

My husband (let's call him Dan) knew that I was worried about my ex, and as a testament to what a great guy he is he set about trying to contact him as they both work in the same field of IT (I know apparently I have a very specialized 'type' lol). Dan is close to his boss and told him about the situation. Dan's boss contacted Bill through Linkedin to set up a Skype ""consult"". Dan's reasoning is that if Fiona is monitoring Bill's emails and social media then this will fly under her radar as she doesn't know Dan's boss and his connection to us. My husband is a sneaky clever bastard.

They scheduled the call a day later and my husband hopped onto the call as well. He didn't tell me exactly what he said, but the gist of it is that Dan and his boss told Bill that we were all worried about him and that if he needed help to just let us know. Bill broke down and started crying. He felt so helpless and thought that no one cared about him. Turns out she was reading all his emails and deleted all the ones from his family as well as controlling all the finances. She was also physically assaulting him and was too embarrassed to tell anyone (she's just shy of 5 foot, he's 6'4''). Dan and his boss told him to pack his bags and head to the airport and they bought him a one way ticket back home!

Bill arrived home a week or so ago and he's doing well. He's staying with his mother and father and Fred has been helping him get back on his feet and handle the legal stuff. Needless to say they are extremely grateful to my husband and his boss and have paid back the cost of the ticket as well as buying Dan and his boss several bottles of very expensive bourbon (which they insisted on, we were happy to cover the ticket but weren't going to argue with them). Dan and I told them that now he's home we were going to take a step back. His family is looking after him now and they don't need our help anymore we'll still keep in touch though and I think we'll always be close to Bill and his family from now on. Fred did tell me that she doesn't want to come back home so we don't have to worry about her turning up on our doorstep.

I don't know how Fiona reacted (she hasn't sent me any emails so I don't think she knows I was involved) or what's going to happen legally because I don't want to be so involved anymore. It's time we focused on our family for a bit because I'M PREGNANT! Couldn't have picked a better man to breed with. Also, Dan's boss let Dan bill the hours of Bill's rescue as ""personal development"" because there are still decent people in the world.

**tl;dr: My instincts were right, Bill was being abused emotionally and physically by his crazy (now ex) wife. My husband and his boss staged an intervention under the guise of work and bought Bill a plane ticket home. Bill's doing fine. He's going to counselling and everyone is giving him lots of support. My husband and I had fun times and now I'm knocked up.**

"UPDATE: My (19f) atheist boyfriend (21m) burped loudly during grace


First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4hndun/my_19f_atheist_boyfriend_21m_burped_loudly_during/

tldr of that was that my boyfriend burped during grace and refused to apologize.

First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to that post I made, I got a lot more responses than I thought I would! And that really made me see how in the wrong kevin was. 

Kevin and I broke up right after that incident. It made me realize a lot of things about our relationship that I guess I wasn't seeing clearly before. He really was arrogant and manipulative. He had this way of saying things that made it sound like he was right 100% of the time and that anything I said was stupid. It wasn't until after I read all of the comments that overwhelmingly said he was in the wrong that I realized just how manipulative he was. Maybe I should mention that kevin was really hot, like REALLY HOT so maybe thats why I didn't realize how much of an ass he was until way later lol.

Anyway, this isn't so much of an update as to our relationship, it's a funny story I heard. I've been working a summer job for the past while now in my hometown where both kevin and I live. It's not a tiny town where everyone knows each other but its not huge either. Anyway at work I was talking with some of my coworkers on break and the conversation of terrible exes came up. The story that my one coworker decided to share was about... you guessed it... kevin.

Apparently they dated about a year ago. my coworker (lets call her (brenda) had to go to her cousins wedding and kevin was her plus one. During the ceremony, kevin got really bored, and he decided to let everyone know. Apparently he started saying stuff like ""oh my god this is taking so long"" and ""is it almost over yet?"" and he kept going on and on. He wasn't so loud that everyone could hear him but the people around him definitely could, brenda said a lot of people were turning their heads to look at them, she was super embarrassed. Apparently they got in a huge fight between the ceremony and reception and that was the end of their relationship. LOL I couldn't help but laugh when I heard that story. Sounds exactly like something kevin would do.

Anyway thats it for my update. Things are going well for me, I'm currently enjoying single life. Just working and hanging out with friends. One of the things that kevin said that really bothered me was that religion never does anything good. That really bothered me so I started volunteering with a  charity that my church helps run once a week, just organizing stuff thats been donated. Maybe I let him get to me but it feels good to help out. I dont hold anything against atheists, you guys totally convinced me that the problem was kevin and that many atheists are cool. So thank you for that!

tldr: turns out my ex bf was a jerk in his other relationships as well. No surprise there!"
"My [18 M] girlfriend [20 F] of 6 months found out how much I make in a month. Now she expects me to spoil her regularly.


Okay Reddit, lately, I've been making pretty solid money at my job, and business has been booming in the area I oversee. I work my ass off, (9-5 laboring in the scalding western sun). My girlfriend is unemployed, but hasn't looked for a job since before we were even dating. I've addressed that issue with her many times, but she always shoots me down and plays the victim. 

Now, I do mobile banking with a relatively small bank in my city, all my expenses and gains are listed in the app, so it's all I use. The thing is, when you open the app, it requires you to enter your password before you can do anything. 

Cut to last week. I had just got to my apartment on payday after work, she came over and we were talking about our days, when I decided to check my bank account. She must've been looking over my shoulder and saw my password before I got into the shower, opened my phone without me giving her permission, and looked at my expenses. When I got out of the shower, she was furious. 

She went on a rant about how I never treat her or care for her (both exaggerations considering I take her out every week and buy her gifts regularly), and how I need to ""clean up my act"" if we are to stay together, because I ""make too much to not treat her like a goddamn queen"". She has never acted like this towards me, so I got very upset. We argued for a while, and after a few hours she stormed out of my apartment. 

I'm on my last leg here. My mind is telling me to leave, but she's genuinely nice and caring, something I've never really had in a relationship before. Help me, Reddit.


   
**tl;dr**: GF saw how much I make in a month, yelled at me for not spoiling her, and stormed out.

"[Update] Boyfriend [25M] and his sister-in-law [28F?] sneaked out to the beach at 3am.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mo80h/boyfriend_25m_and_his_sisterinlaw_28f_sneaked_out/

Hey again.

As much as I wanted to tell you all that it was over nothing, that they just wanted to get some air or smoke some weed or something, not the case. They were indeed fucking.

I asked my boyfriend about it. Didn't mention that I saw him go out with her, just that I saw him leave the bed and come back later. He told me that he just went to pee and then saw his dad in the kitchen who couldn't sleep and they had a chat for a while. Liar.

I asked his sister in law immediately after that, said that I saw her from the window for a second. Was I just imagining it since I was half sleep or did she go out ""alone"" that time of night? She said that she enjoys midnight breaths and alone walks on the beach. Liar again.

I told his brother that I saw them leave. He told me that they enjoy long walks on the beach. He couldn't be bothered to go with them. I thought liar.

So apparently they gave each other the heads up since my boyfriend came to me and told me everything an hour later. Him and his brother like sharing their girlfriends and SOs. He's been fucking his sister in law for years now. That night was just another moment. He told me that he wanted to tell me when the time is right or when he thought I'm prepared so that I can join in and sleep with his brother so they don't even need to sneak around.

He wasn't even admitting that it was cheating, saying that it doesn't count since it's his sister in law not some random girl. I don't even know what to say to that. He called me traditional for thinking it was cheating. Yeah. I consider having sex with anyone else cheating, call me traditional.

So I broke up with him and left him to deal with his weird shit with his brother and I'm actually happier now. The thought of what he was up to all those times grosses me out completely. He can fuck himself. We wanted to go on a holiday together, now I'm gonna go have fun with my cousins instead. 
   
**tl;dr**: They were fucking. His brother knew. It was their thing. They wanted me involved too. No way. We broke up. Fuck them all. "
"My [26M] girlfriend [25F] keeps breaking my shit


She breaks so much of my stuff it doesn't seem like an accident anymore. The day after I got my iPad Pro she broke it, she broke my phone twice, she dropped my laptop and dented it, she broke my other iPad, all since she moved in with me in February. Even putting the expensive stuff aside she breaks tons of other shit. For example I had all my wool sweaters in a special hamper that I told her to never wash the clothes in it so I can make sure they don't get ruined but sure enough she washed and dried them all and they all died. Even though sweaters aren't that expensive individually replacing them cost a ton of money. I kinda think she's doing it on purpose because she thinks it's cute, which would be my fault because when she broke my iPad Pro I told her it was cute how worried she got about telling me. She says she's just clumsy but I don't think that's what is happening. We've been together for almost two years and I've never noticed any clumsiness. 


I locked all my shit up in my office when I went to work the past few days since there was another incident and that upset her a lot because she thinks I can't trust her and I'm treating her like a child. Is it really so wrong to lock up my shit though? She wants to borrow my camera this weekend and I straight up told her no because I know she's going to break it. I'm not using it but I do wedding photography when I want to bring in some extra cash so having to buy another camera would really suck.

**tl;dr**: my SO is constantly breaking or ruining my shit and I think it's on purpose.  "

"[UPDATE] Me [37 M] with my wife [34 F] 12 years, my coworker tried to seduce me should I tell my wife.


https://iy.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4iwhyu/me_37_m_with_my_wife_34_f_11_years_dont_know_if_i/

It says 12 years in the title because me and my wife just celebrated our 12 year anniversary. I took her on a nice dinner and we had a good time but you dont want to hear that romantic shit on with the update.


**Update**

So, where to begin after my post I decided to tell my wife after the kids were settled. I sat her down and I told her this woman had flirted with me in the past and has generally made me uncomfortable.

I told her I didn't reciprocate any attention or flirting but there was something i needs to tell her.

I told her she came into my office and was talking to me and then took off her clothes. (She asked if we did anything) and I said absolutely not and I would never cheat on her.

She then started laughing and said she must of wanted to make a porno with me. (She knows about the camera because she's brought me lunch before and saw it) we both laughed and she just told me she trusts me and is glad that she has a faithful husband.

She took it better than i thought but I was glad I got that off my chest but I still had stuff to do. I reported her the video was reviewed and long story short she was fired. (She gave me the evilest looking eye anybody has ever given me in my entire life)

I would like to say I talked out of there like a badass but I still had paper work so I had to work. But after I was done I felt better actually, this felt like a weight on my shoulder.

Side note for people who want to hear our romantic 12 year anniversary:

So, I knew our 12th anniversary was coming up so this is what I did for her. I tried hard to remember where our first date was and after looking at an old picture I saw the name.

I asked my sister if she could watch them and I took her out for a special night. We had fun and she was really happy and honestly I'm very happy with my life.

We tried uh.....getting busy but my daughter was being a turd and pushing into my wife's rib cage. She felt uncomfortable so we stopped and I'm kinda laughing thinking about. Cockblocked by my own daughter.

Well there's the update bye.
   
**tl;dr**: everything worked out in the end except I was cockblocked by my daughter."
"I [38M] am a sober addict. After years of not welcome me back, my family wants me back - I suspect they want money.


I started using drugs when I was 17. I was mostly into meth but I tried various drugs. My parents decided to help me but like most addicts I struggled and made their lives difficult. There were times that I embarrassed them in front of people, I stole from them and from the rest of the extended family. I did a lot of wrong.

When I was 23 they decided that they've wasted enough time and money on me so they cut me loose. It took me until I was 26 to get my act together and become clean. I went back to them when I was clean when they told me that they can't just take me back and forget about everything that I've done. They were right. I had to try to make things right.

So I stayed around but kept my distance from them. I started paying them back the money that I had stolen from them, and I paid that in full with interest within three years. That's everything that I stole from my parents and my sisters. I know it doesn't make it right but it's all that I could do. I kept sending them birthday cards and gifts, New Years cards, etc even though I wasn't with them at any of those events. Again, just trying to atone for the wrong I've done to them.

Years passed, nothing changed. My sisters married and didn't invite me to their weddings. I still sent them gifts. When my niece and nephew were born I also sent them gifts. When I married my wife they didn't come to my wedding even though I invited them. When my son was born they didn't come to see him or to his birthdays after that.

Two years ago my father had cancer. I reached out and asked if he wanted to see me and offered my support. They all declined. It took them until my father was really sick to reach out. He wanted to finally see me. I went to see him in the hospital with my son. He was very sick and was more or less ready to go. He told me then that he regrets keeping me away and wishes that he'd accepted me back sooner. We spent a whole day together. We were full of regrets but we made our peace in the end. He died a week later.

My mother and sister told me not to come to his funeral. That I didn't deserve to be there. It was hurtful since my father and I had made our peace but I respected their wishes. The funeral is for those who remain and they had the right to not want me around. I went but remained in far distance and only paid my respects when everyone else was gone. That moment was a big deal for me. I stopped trying to have my mother and sisters back. I stopped sending them gifts or cards or anything. I had tried for 10 years and I decided that it's time to move on.

We remained no contact for two years until this last weekend. My mother called me and asked if I can visit them alone. I went there and my mother and sisters were there. We talked a little. They told me that they're willing to put the past behind us and look towards the future, that's all we have is each other, things like that.

The thing is, I got the feeling that they need money and help. They kept mentioning how difficult things are for them, how my sisters are both divorced and single mothers without ""great"" careers and how they struggle to take care of their children. My mother said similar things. They kept mentioning how great I'm doing and how amazing is it that I was able to turn my life around. I totally felt like I was being manipulated. For years I would have done anything for them to accept me back and now they were tapping into those feelings. They never explicitly asked for money but their requests were implicit. They said things like ""family should take care of each other"".

So I need some advice. I'm hurt that the reason they want me back is for money. I loved them and tried for 10 years and received no forgiveness when they didn't need me but now that they need me, I'm loved and great? What should I do?
  
**tl;dr**: During my times of drug use I put my family through a lot and they eventually stopped helping me. When I became clean I tried for 10 years to atone for my mistakes and they didn't accept me. They didn't allow me to attend my father's funeral. Now they tell me that they want me back and are implicitly asking for my help. What should I do? "
"I (20F) tend to approach guys first and ask them out. My friends (all early 20sF) think it's wrong because I'm a girl and ""guys are supposed to make the first move"". Am I right in thinking that's bs?


Throwaway time 


I recently entered the dating scene again (after breaking up with my boyfriend of 2 years) and at first things were quite difficult. Although I'm seen as very attractive I never got approached by guys. They just tend to be really nervous and awkward in my presence. I constantly get male attention but no one ever actually comes up to me. I don't think I'm intimidating at all but maybe it seems that way. On the rare occasion I do get approached it's by arrogant douchebags and I hate it. 



I decided to make things easier for myself so I started to do the approaching. Usually guys are confused (several of them have asked me if I was pulling a prank lol) and act really strange but after a while they open up and things are really fun. If I really like the dude I tell him we can meet up at that time at that place. Things are going very well so far and I've met some really interesting people this way. 



So my friends know that I ask out guys (sometimes I do it when we're all together) and their response has been all negative. They say that it makes me look ""cheap"" and that guys don't like it when the girl is ""easy to get"". They're of the belief that men should always make the first move because it's apparently ""classier"" that way. They especially hate it when it's a good looking guy and say ""oh he's hot, he probably wants a girl to chase not a girl who throws herself at him"". First of all, I don't ""throw"" myself at anyone. I start a casual conversation and if I like the the person I ask for the number. Just because you're good looking it doesn't automatically mean I like you. Btw, I don't always ask out attractive guys either because looks are not the most important thing to me. It's fairly high on my list but I value other things more. For example I approached the guy I'm seeing now at a clothing store and he's not conventionally attractive but I like him a lot. In fact my friends said that I'm ""out of his league"" and that my standards are ""way too low"". They're just constantly negative and criticizing me. They weren't like this before. And you know what? They always complain about ""ugly"" guys approaching them and when I told them to maybe start making the first move they looked at me like I'm crazy. 



At first I ignored their comments but now I'm starting to doubt myself. Is it really unattractive if a girl approaches a guy first? I mean they don't seem to mind but deep down are they really thinking  ""jeez, there must be something wrong with her to come to me first"" ? Be honest with me. I've been told by several guys that they were shocked when I asked them out and that they find my confidence attractive but now I'm thinking that maybe they don't find it ""feminine"" or whatever. I guess I'm really interested in the male perspective as well so please give me some insight if you're a guy 


**TL;DR I approach guys first and my friends are saying that it makes me look cheap, it's not attractive, etc. Is there some truth to that?**

"[Updated] Due to our living arrangements my older sister [26] F] has become very resentful of my sister [16 F] and I [16 F] spending time with her husband [26 M] over her. It's clearly affecting her marriage but we don't know what we can do to fix it


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m1h23/due_to_our_living_arrangements_my_older_sister_26/

Basically, our parents left for Korea two years ago to live closer to our grandparents who were both battling illnesses. They originally planned on staying in America until we graduated High School but due to worsening health conditions they decided to they weren't going to wait any longer. Our older sister stepped up to impress our parents but ended up taking on a little more than she could handle becoming very bitter and jealous toward us, borderline abusive especially with how much time we would spend with her husband.

We got quite a few PMs that were telling us that things could easily go from verbal abuse to physical abuse so we quickly started to look through our options which were basically move to Korea or try to live on our own.

After little bit of research we found out that in our state minors are legally able rent with a co-signature from an adult/parent and as long as the landlord agrees. We turned 17 on June 3rd which I think helped us out quite a bit. So we spoke with our parents about our situation, we made sure not to blame my sister but told my father that we thought it would be best that we moved out on our own to give our sister her life and husband back.

Our parents agreed and we started making calls and within the second day of looking we found a nice cheap single bedroom apartment within our dad's budget. We share a bed now anyways so it's not that big of a deal for us go with one bedroom. We moved pretty quickly through the process, we figured the sooner the better and there was a opening. Our dad flew back from Korea here to help us as soon as we were able to get all the paperwork set in stone. Even though he was extremely upset with my sister, we pleaded her case. And for first time went head to head with our dad a little bit because we understand our parents are cruel and many times unreasonable people and that our sister went through their mental abuse alone while we had each other. 

We must have said something right because he didn't scold her or anything like that. He thanked her for helping us in our time of need and watching over us for 2 years. Which is actually a lot coming from our dad. 

We did end up thanking our sister for everything and expressed how grateful we were to her. To our surprise she actually cried as we were leaving totally unexpected and told us if we needed anything to just give her a call. We wrote her note, which we gave to Frank to give to her later on, not to be overly dramatic but just because we didn't think we could really say everything we had to say in person. We wrote down everything we could possible think of that we wanted to say to her,  about her life, our lives, our parents, how we feel about her, and just some sympathy overall. Basically a big thank you, with some heart to heart. Hopefully one day we can meet back up with her as equals and repay her for her kindness but for now, were just going to do our own thing. We know it'll take more than 3 page note and a little praise from our father to fix our relationship with her but it's a start.

Our father has agreed to keep giving us money to live off of and for rent and told us to continue focusing on our future. His words were to not worry about part-time work and to just focus on school, high education and anything that will improve our college situation before we graduate high school.  We're taking the CCNA certification in a little under 4 weeks and then we'll work on getting any other smaller certifications as well as, 

We did speak with Frank who said we were very brave and mature for taking the initiative and noticing our sister's behavior. He apologized for being unable to prevent her actions and said that he would still check on us and that we were free to text and call him for anything at anytime.

We've been on our own for about 5 days now and so far everything is great.

Thanks for the advice.
 

**TL:DR:** We moved out into our own apartment, our dad came back and thanked my sister for supporting us for the two years and to check out our new place. We left a note with Frank to give to Lily hopefully to give her some perspective about how we actually feel in hopes that someday we can reconnect as sisters.

"Our [38F&amp;42] children/step children [16M&amp;16F] birthday was last week. We told our children we could not afford to buy them a car. My husband parents [60’s] have bought our daughter a car and it has put a huge strain on our family.

"I thought my girlfriend [25F] was cheating on me [27M] but found out something worse and need advice.


I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years and I love her so much I was planning on asking her to move in with me and marry me once I received an upcoming raise at work.

Last month or two she's been exhibiting some textbook behavior that would lead me to suspect she's cheating. I see her significantly less than normal, which she told me was due to her job. Out of paranoia I asked her coworker on Facebook about this. She told me they'd been working normal hours, nothing's changed, and that my girlfriend's attendance has actually been bad. 

Talked to her roomie/best friend of many years and she said that she has not spoken to her as much recently either and is hardly home but she thought she was with me. 

Not only that but any time I am with my girlfriend recently she'd been very protective of her phone and seemed uninterested in being around me, and very easily irritated. This isn't really like her, if anything I was always the one more easily irritated in the relationship.

She briefly mentioned someone she'd gotten back in contact with that used to be a friend in high school, so I decided to message this girl on Facebook asking if she's heard from her a lot recently or what. This girl didn't respond. 

It was really fishy so this lead me to look at her phone the next time we hung out when she was asleep. I'm not proud of it, but every time I brought anything up she was really defensive. 

I looked in her phone and there were no texts suggesting she was cheating. But instead, a lot of texts with aforementioned high school friend about popping pills together, all the new drugs she wanted to try and do, when she could get her hands on more. What hurt the most was seeing ""I don't want to talk to anyone I just want to get high"" in context of this girl asking about if I, or her roomie, knows about what she's been up to.

I don't know what to do. The only person she is talking to right now is the girl who provides her these drugs and does them with her.

I was 99.9% sure she was cheating so I only have been thinking about what I'd do given I found out she was. With this...I don't know. I want to help her, so badly. But I still feel so many things. Confusion, why would she even turn to drugs? She didn't seem unhappy. But a little betrayed that she would act like this to me. And most of all, really concerned. I love her so much and don't want to see her go down this path, a path that could really fucking harm her.
 
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 years was acting strange. I looked into it. Turns out she is not cheating but she is off doing drugs with a girl she knew in high school. I need advice on a solution as I've never dealt with anything like this before."
"Update! ""Would it be messed up for me [22f] to break up with my boyfriend [24m] of about a year in public?"" (answer: NOPE)


Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4n3bon/would_it_be_messed_up_for_me_22f_to_break_up_with/

Hey beautiful people!

I wanted to update you guys because I got SO much excellent advice from people here and I wasn't able to reply to a lot of it because I was a little in my head at the time, so I wanted to be able to say THANK YOU THANK YOU to all of you at once!

First of all, Greg and I are now officially broken up, and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off me. I am a LITTLE anxious about the possibility of him trying to get me back, but some of the stuff he said made me feel this isn't likely. (And for those of you who said to change my locks, etc. - he doesn't have a key to my place! But I am asking a friend to spend the night with me the next few nights just in case!)

So, what I ended up doing: I asked Greg to meet me earlier this afternoon at a park near his place. I sat on the edge of a fountain because it was a spot that was surrounded by people/had a lot of people looking towards it, but there was enough room that we could talk. I also had a guy friend of mine (Sam) sit off at a distance and asked him to keep an eye and he said he'd come over if anything went wrong or it looked like Greg was trying to hurt me or start a confrontation.

I planned out a whole explanation for Greg, including telling him that I wasn't going to reconsider but that I really thought he should get help for unaddressed issues from his childhood. He immediately said, ""I know. You're right. I'll get help. I've been wanting to get help for a while now."" To which I was like uh, no, you haven't, you've actually told me you think therapy is bullshit and refused to even discuss it, but good, get help. And then he said ""only if you stay with me,"" and I reiterated that wouldn't be happening.

He continued trying to talk me out of breaking up with him, like I knew he would, and made me sound really fucking crazy for thinking it was a good idea - he kept saying stuff like, ""you think it's abuse for me to hold your arms down when you're being a cunt and I don't know what crazy shit you're going to pull?"" (for the record, I have NEVER been violent to him, except in trying to get him away from me, and he has no reason to expect this from me)...and ""you just don't know what abuse is because you were spoiled"" and, when I would bring up specific instances, ""that never happened,"" ""you're making it sound so much worse than it was, I was just trying to de-escalate things,"" etc. - basically, giving up on telling me to stay and just trying to convince me I was making stuff up.

At some point, he got really tense and quiet and snide and he said ""really? You think that's abuse? You think this is abuse?"" and grabbed my arm really firmly and dug his nails in (I'm already getting bruises). I probably physically could have gotten away from him but I kind of felt like my brain shut down because it hurt more than what he's done in the past, and because it was kind of an unexpected perfect workaround for my plan...in that it probably didn't outwardly look like much (no one noticed) but still hurt.

He continued to basically go after everything he knows is a sore point for me...""you're just a spoiled bitch,"" ""you don't get it because the worst thing that's ever happened to you is that you regretted fucking someone"" (referring to a very traumatic forcible rape), ""you're a fat cunt anyway""...essentially, targeting everything that was an insecurity for me. I now see he's been doing that in our relationship for a long time in more subtle ways. He's very good at reading people's weaknesses and using them against people.

After he let go of me, I stood up and said ""NO"" (I couldn't really think straight) and started running towards Sam. Greg got up and tried to grab my arm and pull me back, and I stopped so he wouldn't yank my arm off. Sam saw this and came over and physically pulled him off me and told him it's over and he needs to leave me alone and walk away. Sam is a big, pretty intimidating-looking guy - a lot bigger than Greg, which was helpful here. Greg said ""fuck you both, she's got you believing her bullshit too,"" and then ""fuck you, you cunt, you don't deserve me,"" and walked away.

About an hour after that, he started texting me saying he was sorry, that he really wanted my help addressing his issues, that he knew exactly what he's done wrong and he can really acknowledge it now and change, that this was a breaking point for him and he felt so guilty for ""making me feel hurt,"" etc. (I should have blocked him earlier, but I was texting about where to meet up until he got there, and afterwards felt kind of shaken and forgot about it.) I blocked him on my phone and also on Facebook and Twitter. (You apparently can't really block people on gmail, only send their stuff to spam, but I did that too.)

I literally never want to see or hear from him again. I honestly thought I'd feel at least a little sad or guilty or ""what if""-y, but I'm not. I'm so happy to be done with him. After the way he spoke to me today, I can honestly say that I was just wrong about him. I thought he was a good person who just had issues, but he's not - he's a person who's 100% willing to hurt me in ways that no one should, and only apologetic about it when HE faces consequences. I think he genuinely lacks a capacity for empathy - it doesn't hurt him to see me cry or hear that I feel scared! It only hurts him to know that might mean he doesn't get to be with me anymore. Everything he said and did was completely focused on how HE felt and how HE was reacting to things.

So, yeah, I feel a lot of relief now - not only because he's gone, but because this affirmed to me once and for all that EVERYTHING I thought was true and I 100% did the right thing by breaking up with him. He's just not a good guy, and I tend to have a really hard time judging people so I always chalked it up to his past and the fact that he was mistreated by others, but at a certain point, I also think it just doesn't matter why someone is the way they are, especially if they don't care about changing it until it affects THEM.

I also came across this quote while I was researching yesterday that was from a social worker, who said women would tell her their husbands break things when they're angry but it's just because they're out of control and don't know what they're doing, and she would always ask them if their husbands ever break their own things, and the answer was always no - they only break their wives' things. And the social worker said, basically, this proves that they aren't out of control - they know exactly what they're doing and do it anyway. The way Greg acted today reminded me of this - he figured out a perfect way to hurt me even though we were in public, and exactly what to say to me, and he wasn't yelling or getting in my face or being obviously aggressive because he KNEW he couldn't and was actually in control of his behavior. He just hurt me (physically and emotionally) because he wanted to. Not because he had to.

Ok, sorry this is so long winded. I just really wanted to share with you guys because I feel surprisingly great right now and I honestly have no idea how that would have gone if I hadn't gotten advice from you all first, but I suspect it could have gotten pretty ugly.

**TL;DR** - broke up with Greg (and learned exactly how nasty he is) and feel FREE! THANK YOU!"
"Me [29M] and Fiancee [25F] are getting married in 3 Months. 2 somewhat close friends [29M's] are offended that I did not invite them to the wedding...After they didn't invite me to theirs.


**Edit** I spoke with Andy a few minutes ago.  He called to apologize and mentioned that he spoke to Liz and she was not at all surprised.  He said her exact response was ""we didn't them to our wedding. I'm not all that surprised, especially when he probably doesn't have large control over the guest list due to their culture.""  He said that while he's hurt, he understands and that maybe we can get together before or after and work something out.

**Edit 2** Spoke to Steve and Rachel.  This conversation did not go as well.  Rachel was very accusative and called me ""rude and inconsiderate"" to not invite them.  Steve then piled on and noted it was ""different"" in the case where they didn't invite me, since they had a much smaller wedding.  He was also surprised that I would hold a ""grudge"".

I let them speak for a few more minutes before I stopped them and explained to them very clearly that I am not in charge of the full guest list, and that this guest list is roughly half of the guest list we wanted.   On top of that, based on cultural norms and other issues, we had to give priority to a lot of other family and friends.  And that despite whatever they think is ""different"" about their situation.  I have the same problem they do, just on a larger scale.  I then pointed out that while I don't hold a grudge, yes I was offended that I wasn't invited, and yes, it hurt a lot that other friends and distant relatives were invited when I was the only one who stepped up to keep Steve off the streets for months.

I also pointed out that I found it tacky that they thought it appropriate to mention that I didn't give them a wedding gift (and completely disregarding the dinner).  I told them that while they were not explicitly invited, I was also not looking for them to provide me a gift, in line with common etiquette.  

Rachel was quiet for a few seconds and then she said, well.  Are we going to be invited to the wedding or are we done?

I very calmly stated that the core wedding ceremony and the main western style ceremony were at capacity and that we won't be adjusting the guest list.  In terms of the Pre-Wedding shower, and the more ethnic reception, we have some flexibility, but based on our discussion and the general rudeness and sense of condescension from both you and Steve, that no, I will not be extending an invitation.  The fact that you felt it appropriate to exclude me and Ellie from your celebrations but that you feel entitled and EXPECT us to invite you to ours without so much as a real apology...wow.   

Steve just said Really? and then hung up.

----------------------------------------------------

Based on the updates...i'm going to see what Andy has to say, I may end up inviting him and Liz since they both seem very conciliatory and understand my reasoning.  I'd be ok with stretching a bit to accommodate them.  

----------------------------------------------------

Hello Reddit, Throwaway since my friends also read Reddit. (Not Sure about this sub specifically).  Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text.

Anyways, Myself and my Fiancee, Ellie, have been seeing each other for about 3 years now.  It's been long distance, and it's been tough with Visa issues and all sorts of other problems to get her into the country.  We finally had the proper statuses granted, and she's finally getting here so we can get hitched ^_^.   Sufficed to say, we're both super relieved that we no longer have to fly halfway around the world every month or 2 to see each other.


We've been planning the wedding, and it's going down in a few months and everyone is super excited since it's a multi-day blow out event (due to my culture), something like 1200 people over 3 days with 350 people at the actual wedding, and 400 people at 2 separate receptions due to the volume of people.  I'll talk more about this a bit later and why the numbers are ridiculous like this and I think some overlap at a pre-wedding shower that happens the day before.


Anyways, most of you know long distance is hard, things progress slower, things fall apart faster, so it takes A LOT of work to make them last.   And while I know it's an excuse, I was sort of OK with my friendships weakening because of my love for Ellie.   She ran into a similar problem due to the time commitments involved in the timezone differences and traveling (we'd alternate 1 month me, 1 month her, 1 month both of us got to some destination).  On top of that, I'd usually have to travel for a week or more for work a month.


Enter my 2 friends and their wives, Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz (same age as me).    We've been friends since elementary school and while we went to separate colleges, we kept in touch and we all stayed in pretty close contact over the years.   We're not super ultra close friends, but we'd usually hang out once or twice a month and for big events over the past decade...until 3 years ago.  Since my GF at the time lived far away, and I was traveling a lot for work and to see Ellie we all didn't hang out as often.  In all fairness a chunk of it falls on me since I flaked out a few times (though they did a number of times too the few times we were able to plan things).   We ended up only seeing each other once or twice a quarter.  I knew Rachel and Liz for quite some time as well including the full duration of both their relationships with my friends (and we were friends as well).  Steve actually lived with me for about 6 months after he lost his job due to burn out and I let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  He actually met Rachel during this time and I covered for the fact that he was unemployed and homeless (he's since told her and it's a funny story in our group).


My friends during this time met Ellie maybe once or twice...since our trips weren't long, we'd spend time in each other's company or go do tourist things / meet family, and friends if there was applicable time.  Steve and  Rachel got married 2 years, they threw a smaller wedding about 150 people.  We spoke and they talked about the engagement and everything, but I wasn't really posted on the wedding details.  I found out about the wedding when I had made plans with a friend, Paul, and he was like ""oh dude, we can't that day, it's Steve's wedding...don't you remember?""   I was a bit dumbfounded and responded with ""oh...I actually didn't know...I wasn't invited.""


Cue the next day when Steve calls me and to apologize and say that he got an earful from Paul about me not being invited and not even being invited to the bachelor party and that he'd like to extend and invitation to me to attend the bachelor party but unfortunately that they are at capacity for the wedding and that ""you understand how these things go, we have to cut people all the time. Sorry bro.""  I tell him thanks for the thought, but that I politely decline, and wish him the best and that I'll catch up with him and Rachel after the wedding.  I was pretty hurt though.  A few weeks later, Ellie was in town, so Steve, Rachel, Ellie and I all went to a really fancy dinner, and I covered it as a simple wedding gift to them (more on this later).


A few months later, Andy and Liz get engaged, and I make a joke about hopefully Ellie and I can attend this wedding since we we weren't able to come to the last one (we didn't mention to Andy that Steve didn't invite us).  Lo and behold about 2 months later, Andy calls me and says that ""I tried very hard but we can't get enough people to the wedding, and that it's a relatively small affair (200 people total) and that with family and others, we can't spare space at the ceremony or reception for myself or Ellie. Liz and I want to invite you both out to dinner before and after the wedding.""   I politely say thank you and that I hope they enjoy the ceremony.  I'm again, pretty hurt but don't want them to feel bad.


Enter a few months ago, Ellie and I are traveling in Europe and it just felt right so I put together an impromptu proposal and we got engaged in Paris.   We had talked about it a few times before hand and I was fairly certain she would say yes, and the moment really really just felt right so I proposed with a costume ring I had stealthily bought while we were shopping.  NONE of my friends knew until we announced it on our return...again, I hadn't really planned the proposal, so it wasn't something we announced ahead of time to have a big show about.   We didn't make a big announcement in general, just a number of close friends and family.  


Anyways, enter my family.   Ellie and I are of different cultures and ethnicities.  My parents are usually very conservative and I had suspected some blowback from them when I brought an ""outsider"" in.  We were expecting them to want to keep it relatively quiet and small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised that they were super super excited that I was FINALLYYYYYYY getting married and was choosing to settle down.  My mom has had grandchild fever for a few years now...They also absolutely adore and love Ellie.  According to my mom, ""in this day and age, it's hard to find a woman who is both independent and successful in their career, but also able to cook, clean and maintain a household""...tad sexist I know, but that's how my mom is, I think she's just happy that she has someone she can cook with and share recipes with and all the daughter stuff she's been wanting to do in a house full of 2 boys and a husband.


Anyways, my parents offered to help with the wedding...A LOT.   In my culture, it's sort of ridiculous how extravagant the weddings can be.   The guest list is out of control in some respects, but in my culture it's offensive to not invite people to your wedding who have invited you to their wedding.  Additionally, weddings are huge family affairs so this includes folks from years ago and my parents and her parents friends who all get invited, with families in tow.  Ellie and I already planned a much smaller get together with a number of people about a week before the wedding to ensure that we get quality time with our close friends at a mini-reception.  Most of these friends are also invited to the main wedding, everyone understood.  This mini-reception is 50 people and being held on mine and Ellie's dime. We did not invite Steve, Rachel, Andy or Liz to any of the events.  Honestly, I just forgot, maybe a bit bitter...but in all honesty when listing out all the names and families and seating arrangements, our eyes just kind of gloss over.   Our parents both opted to cover 80% of the wedding to accommodate all the cultural norms and to ensure they can invite extended family and friends  We are covering the remaining 20% + honeymoon as well.  While stressful, our parents have been super understanding and helpful in the planning, so Ellie and I are OK with going with the flow.


Anyways, Myself and a lot of friends were out last night having a night on the town, including Steve/Rachel and Andy/Liz.  Ellie is currently in her home country sorting out her affairs in prep for the final move over to the states.   We're all a bit drunk and Rachel asked when the invites for our wedding were going out.  Without thinking, I blurted out, oh we sent those out months ago.  Another friend chimed in saying ""mannnnnn, I can't even begin to comprehend how insane it is to handle that many people at your wedding, you must be going insane, what's the guest list at...like 1500?""  Again not paying attention, i was like nooooooo closer to 1200 at which point I saw Rachel's eyes bug out and my sanity kicked in and we all changed the subject.


This morning, Steve lights up my phone with a ""dude, did you seriously not invite us to your wedding?  Rachel is super upset that you didn't invite us, and after you didn't even get us a wedding gift"".  Andy called a few hours later with a ""I thought we were closer than that? You have a HUGE wedding and you couldn't invite us? That hurts...""  We talked for a few minutes and I mentioned I was out running errands and that I would talk to him later. Same with Steve.


Honestly, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for NOT inviting them.  It sucks, but it is also somewhat offensive that they feel entitled to attend my wedding or claim that I didn't give t hem a wedding gift...when I was not invited, and STILL took them out to expensive and fancy dinner's (100+ a head) to celebrate.


I would like to not damage the relationships as much as possible, but at the same time I'm trying to find out how to approach them properly with why I didn't invite them.


   
**tl;dr**: Didn't invite 2 pairs of close friends to my wedding because they did not invite me to theirs.  In my culture not inviting someone to your wedding can be seen as a huge and deeply personal slight.   They claimed capacity issues, in my case, we already have 1200 people coming across multiple events (precisely to avoid this cultural slight).  How do I explain this to them while properly explaining how hurt I was during their weddings?"
"I (25F) shaved my head in solidarity/support of my sister (21F). My friend (25?F) has taken it upon herself to hijack the situation and is trying to make this into a social media frenzy.


Throwaway because.. well just cause. 

My younger sister 2 years ago was sick. She did not get better. She has cancer and the prognosis is good (not fabulous but good). For the record this is all I am going to say about my sisters condition. Thank you for understanding.

Couple of weeks ago she (my sister) started to lose her hair. Her bf freaked out, it prompted him to leave and it was a totally shitty time. She decided to shave it off earlier this week but she did it alone when she was vulnerable and instead of feeling empowered and in control it left her devasted and worse than ever.

Whilst she was crying in my dad's arms, I left the house walked to the nearest barber shop and came back 45 minutes later (yeah I had a bit of a cry too) to show her that her hair is definitely not what makes her beautiful and that I really am with her. 

I did not do a big selfie of side by side picture or ""if you share this 50k times then she will be cured"" bs on social media because I'm not interested and she would definitely not be down for it. Definitely not. 

My pal, Emma, I went to University with. I graduated 3 years ago and our relationship was close friends at the time but now.. more like friendly Facebook friends. 

I suppose my haircut was more gossip material than I realised because even without posting a picture a lot of people sent me messages saying messages for my sister and for me saying how brave I was- they were kind and I'm not going to get angry at them because it's true. I did shave my head. The world is gonna know sooner or later!

But Emma tagged me in a picture this week and she has shaved her head. In support of my sister who she has never met. This makes me very uncomfortable. I used to think she was quite.. well rather selfish and liked being in the spotlight and this only reinforces this image of her. I'm just frustrated because she has included a message of ""share to support bald sisterhood sister in this time"" and it's like.  Er. Okay? 

My sister saw it and laughed. She goes on Facebook maybe 6 times a year. She has bigger things to worry about like I dunno - cancer. 

I sent Emma a message thanking her for her kind words and gesture, it was rather left field but that it was nice to know strangers cared.

It's escalated enormously in the last 2 days. She has started a Facebook group, she shares pictures of her posing with her new hairstyle  (at times not evening mentioning my family or any cancer patient struggles at all) multiple times a day and I honestly think she's going to start asking for money. 

I sent her a message essentially saying ""okay.. enough is enough. Let's not forget that my sister is the patient here. I would like this to remain a private family matter. Please stop tagging me in your photos and stop this Facebook group and asking for shares"" amongst other things like it was a sweet gesture but I had worried it had snowballed.. I put it nicely!

She saw the message and its got worse. She just posted a picture that got 4k+ shares and comments and like I said no mention of me. But without that mention.. this is going to sound crazy but I think she's trying to slowly make it look like she has cancer or is sick. 

I need to stop this. Neither my sister or my family want or need this. What do you think I should do? I feel good writing this out. Thanks reddit.

TL;DR : Little sister has cancer. I shaved my head in support. Friend who does not know sister shaved hers also in support. She is now sharing pics of herself which I think imply she has cancer."
"[Updated] I [24 F] caught my fiancé [25 M] suspiciously meeting up with a younger girl [16-17 F] at our local coffee shop. He is going through great length to keep her a secret from me, calling her a family friend. I don't understand it.

"I [25M] received some inheritance. Family are upset that I'm not treating them to something. I already am.


My biological dad was never in my life in a meaningful way. I was raised by my mother and my step dad. My biological dad would sometimes visit and spend a day or two with me, but he was mostly married to his job and that was his number one priority. Last time I saw him was when I turned 18.

He died six months ago and I was the sole recipient of his estate since he didn't have anyone else. There were two houses, two cars, about $2m in cash and another $2m in various investments. I met a financial advisor and made plans about the investment.

I gave one of the cars to my parents. That's a 2015 Mercedes S550. My step dad always loved luxury cards so I imagined he would love this. I myself am driving a much cheaper car (my dad's other car, a 2014 Lexus IS 250). My mom and dad met because they both appreciated paintings. My mom is a collector so was my dad. I gave her his entire collection. That's worth a lot of money. Definitely much more than the Mercedes. I let my sister live in the other house rent free as long as she pays for the bills and taxes and I told her that she can live there indefinitely. The rest of the stuff are mine.

I feel like I've been fair here. However my family don't agree. They feel like I haven't been generous enough and they like more. Apparently my parents expected me to give them my dad's main house. That's the house I myself moved into. My sister expected me to give her one of the cards and transfer ownership of the other house to her rather than allowing her to live there.

I feel bad about the whole thing. I have a good family and we all love each other. I feel like I've shared enough and plan to share more as time goes by, but their expectations are too high at this point and I don't like how this whole thing is going forward. I don't know what to do or how to talk to them about everything. I'd appreciate any help.
   
**tl;dr**: I received some inheritance from my dad and shared some of it with my family. They expect more. I don't know how to approach this whole thing.

Edit: I already have a lawyer. That's really not the question."

I'm going to apologize in advance, this may be an unsatisfactory update after I went into so much detail last time. I really struggled writing it. I severely underestimated how painful and embarrassing it would feel seeing everyone discussing my life. I debated whether or not to update at all but this sub has been an incredible resource, even secondhand, for me throughout my life and I owe you that much.

  

I would like to clarify that I misspoke when I implied my husband was the only one who wanted to start trying to have kids. We mutually expressed interest in possibly conceiving before we were married, he didn't want them outside of wedlock, a wedding was his condition to have a serious discussion about it. I should have said something like ""Now that we're *both* ready to start trying"".


  
My husband and I had a very long conversation. The gist of it was that he's had issues with resenting women for perceived slights for a long time. He swears that he hasn't had those thoughts or urges towards me since early in our relationship when he realized I would not be ""cruel or withholding"" towards him. He said he tried not to think about debasing other women when we were together, but found it difficult when I wanted rougher play or was in a position where he couldn't see my face. He seemed confused that I'm not okay knowing he thinks those things about anyone.

  

He said that'd he'd been making a lot of progress but had been ""triggered"" by an incident at his bachelor party. Since then he'd been struggling with intense levels of those thoughts and urges again. He said he knew it was wrong to marry me without coming clean but only felt a tremendous amount of guilt about lying through omission once we were trying to have a child.


  
He said when I confronted him about improving our chances he felt backed into a corner and was ""lashing out"". He told me he didn't believe the things he said to/about me, but did with regards to other women.


  
At some points I felt like he was trying to lead me to the conclusion that his father's overreaction to an incident of ""youthful curiosity"" led to him associating predatory urges with sexual desires. I did not feel equipped to delve into that but it really smelled like bullshit to me.


  
Ultimately I decided that anything he said was irrelevant, my primary problem was that I could no longer trust *myself* to trust him. I also have been unable to envision having sex with him in the future. I'm unable to even remember feeling loved and safe while being intimate with him without feeling humiliated and disgusted. 


  
I told him things of that nature and he just completely deflated and broke down. I felt very detached, almost like I suspected he was crying out of self-pity. I don't know if my feelings were truly warranted.


  
I told him all I could agree to was holding off on making a decision on whether or not to attempt moving forward in the relationship. I wanted no contact while we both went to therapy for six months. After six months I would have a discussion with him and his therapist and see how I felt then. He was very unhappy but agreed.


  
After he left he went to his parent's house and had an unbelievable altercation with his family. He physically attacked his elderly father and did not stop until his thirteen year old sister beat him repeatedly with a baseball bat, to the point he lost consciousness. She said she hit him ""A lot. Like, I knew it was too much but he wouldn't stop.""


  
A lot of disturbing stuff came to light as a result in the wake of that. The incident of ""youthful curiosity"" was severely underplayed and was not the only incident. Then I found out that even though he told me he'd never tried therapy his parents and a few relatives had paid for SIX years of it.



His parents expressed deep shame that they gave us their blessing to wed. They not only revoked it, they offered me his share of inheritance to pay for a future wedding to someone else. 



I'm crazy about my in-laws and absolutely believe their version of this situation over his. I don't accept physical violence was an acceptable response to ANYTHING my FIL could have said, let alone what everyone agrees was said. I also feel like a lot of things my husband told me during our initial discussion were faerie truths.


  

Based on my FIL's shockingly uncharacteristic anger and shame towards his son I believe I still don't have the full picture of my husband's issues but I've seen enough. I'm acjhing for them, they have five other incredible and  wonderful children, I don't really understand what happened with my husband.


  
Ultimately I believe my husband can overcome his issues but I don't feel he wants to change for himself. I'm not interested in being his prize for being a decent person.


  
I'm still planning on getting into therapy before anyone asks. Not only has this has really fucked me up but something must have been wrong before for me to get taken in like this.

"My [17M] mom [35F] married my girlfriend's [17F] dad [39M]. Now friends say it's weird that we're step siblings and dating. WTF?


My friend Jill and I have been best friends since we were 11 and my mom knew her dad from back then. Two years ago Jill and I started dating and honestly it's been wonderful for us. What we didn't know was that my mom was also secretly dating her dad for a year before we started dating.

We learned that they were dating about 18 months ago, six months after we started dating. About a year ago my mom talked to me about how I'd feel if she was to get married to Jill'd dad. I liked the idea since Jill'd dad is a great person and in some ways a role model for me. Jill also felt the same way about my mother. They married 9 months ago.

About six months ago we moved into our new house. This ones is much larger than the one that we used to have and our parents were very kind since they gave me and Jill our own master bedroom with a king size bed and our own bathroom. This has been very good for us (you bet). About the same time they had a talk to us about how we'd feel if they wanted to have a child, and Jill and I were very supportive. They plan to have two and very quickly since my mom is 35. My mom is now three months pregnant and we're looking forward to have little siblings.

That's basically our family now. Everything is perfect at home. But not with friends.

People keep telling us how weird this is. Our friends say they feel very uncomfortable coming to our place. The same with the parents. We keep hearing ""is it true you're step siblings and dating? Jesus"". And no matter how we tell them that we were dating and then we became step-siblings, they tell us that it's still wrong and weird and incest. This whole thing has increased since my mom has become pregnant.

I don't think there's anything wrong with me and Jill being together. Or with my mom and Jill's dad being together. It's not like Jill and I grew up being siblings. I know it can get a little unorthodoxies when the kids are born. I will be their brother, Jill will be their sister and we'll be dating but I don't think it will be a big deal at all.

This whole thing is bothering me and Jill and is affecting our social life and our relationship with our friends. We don't know what to do except telling our friends to not talk about it, but they don't listen.
   
**tl;dr**: my girlfriend's dad and my mom are married together now and my mom is pregnant. People find it weird. Friends and their parents included. It's bothering us and we don't know what to do with our friends."

"My fiancé [25 M] lied about speaking Korean fluently to me [24 F] for 3 years. I don't know what to think.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nb40d/my_fiancé_25_m_lied_about_speaking_korean/


First I want to say that I admit I was totally wrong for trying to make this about me, and I realize my parents and friends  as well as myself were all horrible people which I agree with.

I spoke with Jimmy same day I posted the thread, I actually invited him over to my parent's place for dinner but before that I stopped by his parent's house to apologize to him, his dad and his younger sister for everything because I felt so embarrassed and horrible. I apologized profusely to his dad, who did nothing but laugh.

His dad was beyond understanding and actually spoke Korean quite well himself, he actually laughed saying that he understands why my parents were the way they are. He even told me about the story of when he first met Jimmy's mom's parents in Korea and how much she warned him about their behavior. He said that she explained it to him and he understood and was able to respect where their concerns were coming from in terms of wanting to preserve their language and all heritage

He told me it started off rocky, but they shut up so fast when he surprised them and spoke it fluently. He said his relationship with her parents now stronger than ever especially since she past away and he calls them twice a week just to chat. He said that when he heard that I stuck up for Jimmy he was proud of me even though he never said anything.

Jimmy's sister she's only 12 but is super sweet and mature for her age, she said that when Jimmy started dating me was the day he started teaching and talking to her in Korean again, it was really precious the way she described it. His dad teaches/talks her as well but she really likes when Jimmy does it.


As for Jimmy and I we been working together to resolve our communication issues and we've spent a lot of time talking all about us. 

I admitted all my concerns and he addressed them one by one and told me exactly what I needed to hear. He apologized for keeping it from me for so long and told me that he didn't do it maliciously. 

He just didn't want to associate Korean with the negativity that my parents and friends brought. Which I find is extremely understandable. He said he regarded the language as something pure that him and his mother often shared together, that he didn't want to engage in with my parents and friends. He admitted that it probably sounded silly, but I understood him on an emotional level. 

He told me about how close him and his mom were (We had never talked this in-depth about it before) and I cried like a little baby because I could tell how much he loved and missed her. 

He told me that she always teased/warned him about the complications of marrying a full blood Korean while he was a teenager and he didn't truly understand until he met my parents and friends. I even found out that Jimmy was born and lived in Korea for 12 years. 

I feel like our relationship is stronger as ever, my doubts and worries are gone and we're going to be a lot more open with one another. I'm ashamed I ever tried to doubt him. He has been speaking Korean to me a lot more exclusively since I've apologized to him. 

Most probably won't understand but he took me to see his mother's grave and it was probably one of the most touching moment I've ever had with him. I kneeling beside him listening as he told her about me basically how he knew he had found the person he would make new memories with and how he would have to go back on a promise. I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life, I couldn't even stop. 

We had dinner with my parents on Tuesday and Jimmy spoke to them in Korean for the first time and my parents apologized for their tongue. 

I think I didn't make it as clear as I should in my original post but after I defended him they cut back significantly. 

Jimmy apologized for their years of disappointment teasing them for their original concerns. He told them a little about his mom and when he told them his mother's maiden name my father's eyes lit up. He didn't really go into detail but he think he might have known of her family. It made him extremely chatty and open, I've never seen my father so excited to talk to someone before in my life.

Jimmy also brought up that his family are planning a trip to Korea this Summer and he offered to pay for all of us to come with them. My parents haven't been back in years and they happily accepted his offered. 

Jimmy is wonderful really, I'm lucky to have him and I'll never let him go.

Thanks for the advice.

**EDIT: Jimmy's apology to my parents for years of disappointment was in a joking manner, not something sincere. It was meant as a joke and everyone laughed about it. Sort of like breaking ice or easing the tension in the room**

**TL;DR:** Apologized to Jimmy and his dad and sister. Learned about Jimmy's mother and a bit about his past. He's decided to speak Korean more. He forgave my parents and even is offering to bring them to Korea with his dad and sister near the end of the summer. All around everything worked out perfectly."
"I [23/F] don't know whether my SO of two year's [24/M] appearance-related ""preferences"" cross the line.


I'm looking for a little unbiased advice and am hoping this might be the place to get it. Throughout our relationship, my SO has always been very detailed and specific in expressing his preferences regarding my appearance. I guess I'm fairly defensive when it comes to appearance-related criticism and I don't know if I'm just too sensitive and need to compromise or if his requests are a bit excessive.

SO has made a number of sort of cutting, backhanded compliment type comments over the years. Along the lines of ""Your lady parts aren't my usual type, but because it's you I can handle it."" I've talked to him about it and he doesn't seem to have a good explanation for this behavior, but agreed to try to stop. 

My privates are the most frequent subject of contention. He has stated that he prefers ""smooth, tight vaginas with minimal wrinkling"" which apparently doesn't describe mine. There's very little I can do about that, so his comment naturally made me feel a bit self-conscious, especially regarding future intimacy. I also don't completely shave down there, which he absolutely hates. I have extremely sensitive skin, in general, and I find that shaving or waxing especially intimate areas just isn't tolerable. I've seen other posts where women described similar issues, so it can't be all that uncommon. SO is entitled to his preference, of course, but having to hear his complaints every other day just gets really old. He even researched laser hair removal, which I had to explain that I just cannot afford at this time. 

SO also complains about the length of my hair. It is about shoulder length, which I find to be flattering and easy to style. SO wishes it was much longer and has pointed out that I wore my hair very long when I was a young teenager. I attempted to explain that people change their hairstyles and that I no longer like wearing my hair very long or have time in the mornings to style a mass of thick, bum-length hair. His response was: ""It doesn't even have to be very long- just long enough to cover your nipples.""

I'm at my wit's end trying to accommodate his preferences and I am beginning to wonder whether we are simply incompatible and I might be better off ending things.

   
**tl;dr**: How much should you reasonably be expected to change about your appearance to please a partner?

EDIT: Wow, I'm blown away by how much attention this has gotten! I'm adding a couple of pieces of information here that lots of people have asked about. Yes, SO is very into porn and has been from a very young age. The only other actual relationships he has had were when he was 14 and 16, respectively, so he doesn't have a lot of experience with adult women's vaginas/labia/pubic hair, etc. in real life. "
"A ""friend"" [25 F] has been brigading my [24F] business.


Throwaway as I don't want this attached to my professional account. 


I'm a make up blogger, make up artist, and how to make up youtube artist. Basically, make up is my livelihood. It's been a wonderful part of my life and because my dad was a make up artist in a well known play district it's kind of a cool ""passing the torch"" thing. I make a majority of my living from make overs, personal consultations, and occasionally helping out my dad. I'm fairly confident in my skills and have great reviews on my webpages.... until Tuesday of this week. 



My boyfriend (Fred) has a group of friends that I've since joined and come to love. Recently one of his old high school classmates (Carrie) reintroduced herself to the group and has been going out with us. Two weeks ago we all decided to go hipster hopping. We basically switch between going to a bunch of super hipster bars or late night coffee places. My boyfriends younger sister was joining us and was a hanging out with me at my place while I was getting ready. She asked me if I'd help her with her eyeliner and I obliged, I also spruced up her look a little (with her permission) and gave her tips and how tos. She's the same skin tone as me and already had most of her make up on so it didn't bother me to spend fifteen minutes helping her a little. 


We went out and everyone had a great time. Boyfriends little sister received tons of compliments on her make up, and was hit on a little more than usual. She made an offhand comment about how I should always do her make up and how grateful she was. Nothing else really came up about make up aside from me complaining once about a birthday-zilla sweet sixteen girl I worked on a week or two ago.


The next day Carrie messaged me and asked me if I'd give her a full make over for a wedding coming up. I told her I'd be happy to give her a few pointers specific to her skin tone, face shape, and so on... or if she ever happened to find herself getting ready at my place I could help her with something like eyeshadow or contouring... However I told her that if she was interested in a full make over my rate for friends and family is X. I charge simply because I genuinely do a full makeover, complete with going to Sephora, MAC, and other stores to purchase make up that better matches their skin tone, easy to use so on, thats included in the price so they may keep their own make up. I've done this with wedding parties, with sorority formal parties, with sweet sixteeners and who ever else hires me for make overs. I feel that way at least you keep the make up I use on you. I only charge friends and family a flat rate as opposed to a flat rate and hourly charge that I normally charge. If someone has all the make up and tools they need then I just charge an hourly or a small fee for friends and family.


Carrie tried to barter and even brought up that I did boyfriends sisters make up. I informed her that I charge this just to cover the cost of make up, if she had her own and needed help with certain aspects I wouldn't mind helping but full make over is full make over. 


During the week we decided to go out to a reading from an author I love and all met up at my place. Carrie was very late and when she showed up she wasn't ready and she had brought her make up bag. I hoped to goodness that she just misinterpreted my message about getting ready in my home as at this moment we were running late and needed to speed to get to the reading on time. I said something along the lines of being ready to go, and she told me that she thought I was going to do her make up. I told her that we had to leave now and that wasn't enough time for me to do her make up. She became very irate and said that she didn't wear make up because I was going to do it and that she needed it done or wouldn't go out. 


I told her that I couldn't do her make up at this moment as we needed to leave now. She threw her make up back on the ground and yelled that I have to do her make up, she didn't wear any. One of the bottles in her bag broke and foundation splattered across my floor, other things just scattered. I've never felt so aggravated with someone before. So I listed the following reasons as to why this was not a good time and very inappropriate of her.


* She was 20 minutes late. If she had arrived 20 to 30 minutes earlier I might have been more receptive to helping

* She was already aware that I don't do full make overs without a charge as they can be time consuming...something we don't have any of

* This is one of my favorite authors, she knew this as I had excitedly posted in the group message and even commented on how she liked one of his other novels, so I felt her acting out like this was a little selfish

* I hate to be Larry David, but, that scene where he asks the off duty doctor to look at his rash and the doctor responds by asking him to write something for him off duty is just how I felt. I like make up and make a living from it, but I don't want to sit around doing make up all the time.



Carrie just turned around and left. She didn't collect her make up items, just left. Our friends apologized and said that even in high school she could be a little pushy to get what she wanted. We left and were able to make the last 10 minutes of the reading. It wasn't what I wanted and I spent the entire time with a sour taste on my tongue. 


That night Carrie texted me and told me that now I owe her a makeover (day of the wedding she's going to) for how I treated her and for stealing all of her make up. I refused and told her that she threw her make up bag on the ground and I would give it to a friend to give to her. I told her to not expect help like that from someone who she treats so terribly. She responded that I'd regret my decision and that's it. For a while I felt on edge but things wound down through past weekend and I felt better. I woke up tuesday morning to a lot more notifications on my social media pages than usual. 


Carrie had gone to many websites, support groups, and I don't know what else and complained about me. She said that I shame women, I shame overweight women (and minorities), I act superior because I can paint on a pretty face, and I bullied her. My yelp has 15 new bad reviews (and counting) from people who have never been clients, my google is the same, my youtube videos are getting really terrible comments, I've received many hurtful/vaguely threatening PMs/DMs on instagram, Facebook, twitter, and well anything I can get them on. She even shared photos of me on back page  with my real phone number. 



I'm scared, livid, and unaware of how to go forward. My boyfriend is upset but has no idea how to handle it as no one has been able to get ahold of Carrie to stop the brigading... even then my fear is that now a brigade has begun, Carrie won't be able to stop it. 


Was I wrong for sticking to my pricing structure with Carrie? 

How can I stop a brigade? 

Do I have to wait it out? 

How do I handle Carrie?
   
**tl;dr**: Friend asked me to do her make up. I informed her I charge for make overs. She arrived at my home late for an event i was looking forward to and demanded I do her make up. I refused and now she has started brigades against me which make me and my business look poorly. How can I stop a brigade? Do I have to wait it out? How do I handle Carrie?"
"Me [30 M] with my niece [10 F]. Brother died. What do I do?


Hello Everyone,

This is my first time on reddit and I’m not quite sure how everything works, but judging by the other posts I think I’m in the right place.


I will try to be as brief as possible, but this situation is quite convoluted so it might take a while to describe everything clearly.

There is some background information that could be helpful to know.
I am German as is my brother and his wife. While they still live in Germany, I have been in Hong Kong for the past 11 years.
My brother and I have never been close, not even in our childhood. My parents died 7 years ago and since then I have been in touch with my brother exactly once. This was simply to arrange parents’ funeral, will, costs and anything else that needed to be taken care of. Since then it was radio silence. We don’t hate each other or anything of sorts, it just simply that we never cared for each other. To be quite honest if it weren’t for our parents we probably would have never talked. We also don’t have any living relatives anymore. My brother was married to his wife for quite some time, around 12 years I believe. They have a daughter that is now 10 years old.


My brother and his wife died 1 month ago in a car crash leaving behind the daughter. I learned of this from his lawyer whom contacted me roughly 3 weeks ago. I am now the only living family relative that the daughter, I will call her Anna, has left. The Jugendamt (CPS equivalent of Germany) has approached me and as I am the last living relative they want me to take care of her. While I am absolutely willing to do so there are several things that make me worry.


1.	I don’t live in Germany anymore, but Hong Kong. It’s a completely different culture and I don’t think it’s the best idea to rip someone out of their used surroundings and place them in a culture they have never experienced, even less so when her parents died a mere month ago.
2.	I have spoken and met Anna exactly twice before this. Once a year after she was born and then 7 years ago at my parents’ funeral.
3.	I am a 30-year-old, single male and have never planned to have any children. I have no idea how to handle, much less raise one.


The reason that the Jugendamt wants me to take her (adoption would ultimately be the final step of this process) is because there is no other fitting candidate. Considering my general situation, I found that hard to believe, but after having a lengthy discussion it turns out that’s the case. The next best option would be to hand her into foster care, but I quite honestly don’t want to put anyone through that. I am currently in Germany doing my best to take care of her with the help of the Jugendamt, but I cannot stay for much longer as I need to get back to Hong Kong. I have to make decision within the next 2 weeks on whether to take her with me or hand her into foster care. I have talked to Anna about what she wants, but she does not really know and I completely understand why. Ultimately I want to make the best decision for her.


I am usually working 10-11 hours each day, but since I am my own boss I can flexibly leave work during the day and complete the rest of it from home at night. The legal aspects of the Visa and living arrangements are also covered so there would be no problems there. I make well into the 6 figures and can provide for her without a problem, I also love to cook and have a fairly calm lifestyle, meaning I go to bed early and get up early.


I would like to get your opinion if it is best that I adopt her and if so what I could do to make sure that I can provide the best care she can get? If you have any recommendations on how to catch up on 10 years’ experience of raising children, I would also greatly appreciate it.




Thank you for your time.

TL;DR; Brother died and I need to decide whether to adopt my niece or not."
"I(27M)found a locked folder filled with pictures of me on my wife(23F)'s laptop. Do I just ignore it?


So my wife and I have been together 4 years, married for 1. Recently she has gone to visit family members living in another country and I couldn't go with her due to my job. She has been gone for two weeks now and will be back on friday. About three days ago she asked me to send her pictures of our daughter stored in her laptop as she wanted to show them to family members. So I went to get the folder but among the many folders there was one that was locked. I know it was wrong of me, I shouldn't have snooped and I violated her privacy. I didn't even believe I could get her password right but I did (she tends to use really obvious ones like a combinaison of my and our daughter's birth dates so it wasn't that hard). Turned out the folder was filled with pictures of me, hundred of them. Pictures I knew were being taken and more candid ones like me sleeping or being busy. What I don't understand is why she would lock this folder? I could understand if she wanted to protect my privacy by locking that folder but there are other family pictures in folders that are not locked. There are also no intimate pictures of me.

I spoke about it with my brother but he didn't take it seriously and kept making jokes about how my wife was a hitman and I should be careful. If she had just a folder filled with pictures of me I could somehow understand, but that folder was *locked*. She knows it doesn't bother me that she likes taking pictures of me so why lock it? My question is, do I just forget I found this folder or do I ask her about it knowing she will get upset over me snooping? Is is it worth it? Does anyone have any idea why she would do that? I know this issue is not really that important in the grand scheme of things but I was wondering if it was worth potentially starting an argument.



   
**tl;dr**: My wife has a locked folder on her laptop filled with hundreds of pictures of me. I found it by snooping. Do I ask her about it or do I just let it go?

Edit: Thank you all for the different insights. I have finally decided to just pretend I don't know about that folder as it is most likely harmless and I actually feel really flattered."
"UPDATE: I [22M] am at my girlfriend's [22F] family home in a faraway state. Feeling unwelcome, childish, and disrespected by her mother's [40'sF] boyfriend [40'sM]


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4marv8/i_22m_am_at_my_girlfriends_22f_family_home_in_a/)


So, since the events of my last post, I spoke with my girlfriend the following morning expressing how disrespected and unwelcome I'd felt, given the way Tim had treated me after I'd driven halfway across the country and spent my own money to bring Cindy back to her mother for a visit. I told Cindy that I wasn't going to put up with being treated like an intruder, and that I wanted to stay in a hotel room or find alternative sleeping arrangements for the rest of the trip. I said that I would be happy to go to dinner or something with her mother but that I didn't want Tim there because of the way he'd been rude to me. 

I was surprised at how well Cindy took all of this, and she said she understood and that she'd hoped Tim would be better behaved than he had been. Fortunately, she had an old friend who completely understood the situation with Tim and offered to let Cindy and I stay for a couple of nights until the trip was over. (If I haven't mentioned, basically everyone who knows Tim apart from Cindy's mother thinks he is absolute trash, and no one understands what she sees in him.) Tim and Fannie were away picking up Tim's son (""Michael"", 16M) and wouldn't be back in town for another day, so Cindy and I ended up staying over at the house again since they were gone and decided that in the morning, we'd pack up all our stuff and bring it to her friend's house; Cindy would find an opportunity to talk to her mother in person about the reason our stuff was gone and explain that we'd be staying elsewhere.

Fast forward to the next night, by which time we'd loaded all of our stuff up into my car and were simply waiting for them to return, when Fannie texts that their flight is delayed and they won't return until very late; Cindy tells her about the situation over the phone and tells me her mother sounded annoyed but understanding. We go to Cindy's friend's house and go to sleep, because we're attending her friend's baby shower the next day, as is Cindy's mother.

The next day at the shower, Cindy and I go and have a nice time until Fannie shows up and pulls her to the corner of the room to talk about the situation. She and Cindy talk, but Fannie begins making an absolute embarrassment of herself, crying openly in the middle of someone else's baby shower (she could easily have gone outside to have this conversation) and telling Cindy that ""carpaggio_throwaway needs to fix this situation"", saying how I'd apparently been ""disrespectful towards (Cindy's) family"" because I didn't stand up to shake Tim's hand immediately and how ""she sees traits in me that she saw in (Cindy's) father"" (whom she is divorced from.) She then leaves in a huff, having made quite the scene, and my girlfriend tells me what happened outside and says how upset she is with her mother. (I found out later, that after this all went down, Fannie talked with Tim and called Cindy's father in my hometown to talk about how disrespectful I was being, with Tim saying Cindy was ""choosing (carpaggio_throwaway) over her family."")

Cindy consults with her father, who suggests that, for the sake of smoothing things over with everyone, we be the bigger people and invite them out to dinner. I really, *really* didn't want to see Tim again, especially now that I knew he'd be aware of my reason for leaving, but Cindy understandably just wants her mother to love me the way she does, and so I agree to go to dinner. After a couple of hours, Fannie and Tim accept, and the four of us along with Michael meetup that evening for dinner.

It is an excruciatingly awkward dinner; everyone is civil and polite, but it is clear Tim is uninterested in getting to know me, though Fannie does make some small talk with me. At the very least, Tim says nothing rude to me, and I don't talk much throughout the meal. When the waiter asks about the check, I offer to pay for the meal, but Tim basically ignores me and insists upon separate checks.

We leave town the next day, stopping to visit Cindy's other family, all of whom love me. It seems clear that the commenters on the other post were correct about how toxic Fannie and Tim can be, and with any luck I'll be keeping them out of my own life, if not Cindy's, as much as possible.

TL;DR: Fannie and Tim turned out to be extremely toxic, and after an excruciating dinner and some ridiculous drama on their part Cindy and I have left town and aren't planning on returning soon.

EDIT: Cindy's dad was completely supportive of us throughout the whole thing, and he took the call knowing Fannie was in the wrong.

EDIT2: All right, I've gotten loads of comments that seem to think Tim was just joking, that I'm probably just being ridiculous when I say that everyone hates Tim, etc. so I'm going to list out more of the rude/shitty/abusive things he regularly does to people that I didn't think I'd need to go into. Hopefully it won't make people so sure that I'm some whiny kid who can't handle ""joking.""

-Tim has repeatedly called my girlfriend a ""whore"" in the past.

-Tim tried to force Fannie to put Cindy's brother in the military (not that she could have, but he still tried. Keep in mind these are not his children)

-Tim makes comments about women that are extremely inappropriate. He points out when Cindy's friends have skin showing or have gained weight.

 -Tim gives rude nicknames to EVERYONE, not just me. Everyone I've talked to hates it and doesn't think it's funny or a joke.

-Tim has had falling outs with nearly everyone in Cindy's family. Every family member I met on the trip thinks he's incredibly rude, abrasive, and borderline abusive, including Fannie's own parents."
"UpdateMy girlfriend (25F) of 6 months proposed to me (28M)


Thanks for everyones comments on my last post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m1dgi/my_girlfriend_25f_of_6_months_proposed_to_me_28m/)). People were asking for an update so here it is. We ended up breaking up. Not what either of us wanted but probably for the best. She said the reason she proposed was she felt like I deserved a wife and my son deserved siblings and to be a part of a real family. I won't get into how I feel about that but I understand where she is coming from now. I don't think she's crazy, I think she just got caught up in the idea of being a family and didn't have enough life experience to realize it. Anyways she gave me a book she was going to give to my son as a belated birthday gift which was really cool of her. It's customized so she probably couldn't have returned it anyways but she still didn't have to do that. She dealt with everything pretty well, although she did email my ex to apologize for trying to replace her which made my ex freak out a bit lol. 


I feel bad because I obviously did something to make her think I wanted her to propose and things were going so well before that but from what she told me this would have never worked out. I think she just needs someone with less baggage. 


Lastly, about my comment about not wanting to be proposed to, the issue is more that I prefer to be dominant in my relationships, not that she is a woman. She understood our dynamic just fine which is why it surprised me. 


**tl;dr**: we broke up, it wouldn't have worked out anyways. "

"Me 42F with my stepdaughter 20F, wants me to apologize to her fiance


My husband and I have been married for 10 years and have two kids together. He has two children from his previous marriage. He shared joint custody of them with his ex. My stepkids lived with their mom and stepdad most of the week and we'd have them with us about 40% of the time. My husband and his ex had their issues, there were fights and arguments, but for the most part they managed to coparent in a somewhat civil fashion. 

When my stepdaughter Katie (fake name) was 16, she got pregnant. Her Mom is a religious Christian and is prolife. Everyone in her Mom's side of family is Christian and staunchly pro life. When Katie got pregnant things got very ugly with her stepdad. He was furious with her and things were bad enough to affect the relationship between him and Katie's Mom. Though the Mom is very prolife, she wanted Katie to have an abortion. 

My husband and I are not Christian and are pro choice. We gave Katie the option that she can choose what she wants to do. We promised to help raise the baby if she wanted to carry on her pregnancy and we also promised to help her with an abortion if that's what she wanted. She chose to go with an abortion. 

She couldn't get it done where we lived so we took her to a clinic that was in a different state. We paid all expenses and also took care of her out of state while she recuperated. She and her Mom wanted to hide this from her maternal relatives so we presented this as a vacation with Dad and stepmom sort of deal. 

Leading up to the date of the procedure, I reminded Katie that we will support her if she changed her mind. Even on the day of the procedure, before she went in, I reminded her that it's never too late to change her mind. The nurses and doctor at the clinic were very good to her, provided her with counseling and made her aware of all her options. Both my husband and I stayed with her through the entire ordeal and then we took her to a resort to rest and recover before we drove back home. 

While we supported her, we were very disappointed that she was having unprotected sex in spite of all the sex ed we had given her. After this procedure my husband and I gave her a strong talking to about the risks involved and insisted that she take some form of long acting contraceptive till she's ready to have kids. Based on her doctors recommendations she went with an IUD. Her Mom was upset with us for making her get on birth control and it was a point of contention for a long time.

After Katie graduated school and went to college we saw less and less of her. She'd spend plenty of time with her Mom and maternal relatives but would hardly ever see us. It was disappointing but she was an adult and it was her choice. I later learned that she had become very religious, like her Mom, and both of them disapproved of our lack of religious practice. 

Katie eventually met and got engaged to a Christian guy who she met through her grandmother's church. Her new fiance and his family is also prolife. We met him a couple of times and he seemed like a very nice guy who is good to Katie. 

At some point, the fiance came to know that Katie had an abortion. I have no idea how that whole thing came about, but he got pretty upset when he learned that. He came close to breaking off their engagement. He also learned that Katie uses an IUD and he has a low opinion of women who use such things. I don't really understand the reasoning but he believes people on long term contraceptives are sexually promiscuous. Or something to that effect. I am hearing everything third hand so I don't have an accurate understanding of what exactly the issues are between him and Katie. 

Katie cried and begged him to not break up with her and to convince him she claimed that she was forced into having an abortion by her stepmother. The fiance has met me only twice and throughout the relationship Katie has presented to him that she's not close to Dad and stepmom. She's shown him proof that we were the people who took her to that state and had her stay there. She has messages from me reminding her to get her IUD. She's shown him enough to convince fiance that she'd never had gotten an abortion or an IUD if it were not for her stepmother forcing things on her. 

Fiance has agreed to proceed with the wedding on the condition that she cuts off all contact with us. Katie agreed to go no contact with me but she wants her Dad to give her away at her wedding. Fiance will only agree to Dad's presence at the wedding if I'll apologize to both of them for forcing her to get an abortion and if I promise to stay away from them and their future progeny. 

I have no problem staying away from them but I am furious that she wants me to apologize to this guy. I feel so exploited by how this situation has come about. I spent my hard earned savings on helping this girl! My husband is upset at Katie too and says theres no way he expects me to apologize, but he is also very heart broken that he may end up missing his daughter's wedding. 

Should I suck it up and say sorry for my husband's sake? I am not entirely certain what the apology is supposed to look like, but I suspect it'll take a religious flavor and that is making me even more apprehensive.


**tl;dr**: Helped stepdaughter get an abortion because she wanted one. Now her prolife fiance wants me to apologize for that."
"I am [25f], my husband [25m] refuses to compromise on the order of our sex acts 3x a month. Contains a lot of TMI and tl;dr.


Edit: I wanted to reassure some of you that I am safe and currently staying in a hotel (my husband doesn't know where, I had a friend book it for me).

I've been repeatedly refreshing the page and rereading all of your comments for hours now. I think I posted under the misguided hope someone would say something that would make sense and give me back the man I believed I married. Instead I've become more and more terrified that I've let it get this bad. I used to be very guarded when it came to relationships and I believed I'd been so careful to pick a ""good one"". It's been very difficult to accept the things people are saying but I realize I have no rebuttals and am too invested in who I believed my husband to be. There's nothing that will make this ok to me, it hurts more and more the longer I think about it. 

I have no idea what I'm going to do yet. At this point I still feel like I'm mourning the ""loss"" of my husband and future child.  I can't even contemplate engaging in the comments yet but I will try and update eventually when I decide what I'm going to do. First I'm going to get drunk and cry a lot.

My husband and I met three years ago on a dating website and have been married for nine months. He was a virgin when we started dating (which he chalked up to going to a very religious and primarily white high school and college while he was neither, not personal choice). I actually had to give him ""the talk"" and explain how our reproductive systems work. He was also somewhat insecure about believing that I found him sexually attractive. Because of this when we started having sex I was less assertive than usual and tried to remember to be extra understanding and patient because he is less experienced.


  
I admit I'm very easy-going sexually and don't have too many hard limits or preferences so it made sense to just let him be the one who sets the pace in our sex life. Things like anal, outdoor, or menstrual sex happened only as he became interested in them, etc. His only request that I've rejected was to film ourselves having sex but he was very understanding of my reasons, he wouldn't even ask me to send suggestive pics after that discussion.


  
We're a little bit mis-matched in the libido department. It became apparent he didn't feel comfortable turning me down if I attempted to initiate when he wasn't up for it. If he couldn't perform he'd become withdrawn and acted as if it were a failure on his part, regardless of what I said. I felt reluctant to initiate after this happened a few times so I asked if he could just be the one to initiate as he wanted because it doesn't take much to get me interested and he agreed. I have turned him down or limited our activity to oral on a few occasions with no issues. 


  
I have negative associations with the words ""dirty"" and ""whore"" and asked him to use ""filthy"" and ""slut"" instead because they don't throw me out of the moment. He made a token effort but ultimately asked me to deal with it because it throws him out of the moment to censor himself. He doesn't say them often and usually only does so to help him get into it when I ask him to be a little rougher or spank me (not his favorite but he doesn't outright dislike it) so I felt it was a fair compromise to ignore it and let him have what he needed to enjoy the kind of sex I request sometimes. 


  
We've also fallen into a couple of routines based on what works for him. Namely having him finish via oral before engaging in penetrative sex as he has a hard time not ejaculating prematurely. He lasts long enough the second round for me to get more than my share of orgasms and I enjoy giving oral (which he eagerly reciprocates) so this was a non-issue to me. 


  
He asked if we could have bareback sex after I started taking birth control and we both exchanged STD test results. I was very paranoid about pregnancy so I agreed only if we also used spermicide and the pull out method as well. After a couple weeks of this he asked if during my less fertile days he could finish inside of me during the second round as we were already using two other birth control methods. He also claimed his second ejaculation is ""less risky because there's so little of it left"". I agreed pretty quickly as I wasn't too fond of finishing him orally the second time because he'd usually taste or smell like spermicide by then.  


  
Now that we're married and he wants us to concieve I've stopped all methods of birth control (pill, spermicide, rhythm/pullout). Last week I told him I'd like him to finish inside of me the first round because I felt like that first ejaculation is more likely to result in a successful conception. I said I could finish him orally if he wanted the second round because he wouldn't taste of spermicide. He told me he prefers to finish orally the first time because it feels better that way. I conceded we only needed to change our routine for the three most fertile days of my cycle. He would not agree to that, he doesn't want to make any changes to our routine whatsoever. 


  
I told him I know it is probably irrational of me but I respect his personal superstitions (which he has admitted he knows are illogical) and expect the same consideration when I ask for something without a negative impact on him. I don't want to conceive (if I even can) using his stragglers and don't feel such a minor concession as changing up the order of our sex acts 3x a month is too much to ask for. 


  
He's accusing me of ""bait and switching"" his expectations of our sex life now that we're married and reneging on our ""unspoken agreement"" that he gets final say on how things work in the bedroom. He's cited my previous concessions I mentioned above as proof of that ""agreement"". I am absolutely shocked that's how he's intepreted our sexual relationship. He's also backpedalling on admitting his second ejaculation is typically much weaker and accusing me of thinking he's not ""potent"".

  

Since our disagreement we haven't had any sex. He told me not to ""worry"" about him asking for sex as he isn't attracted to me while I'm being ""disagreeable"". He's also made some comments that have left me feeling pretty disgusted and creeped out at the thought of having sex with him in the future. Namely that he liked having me defer him in the bedroom because it felt like ""payback"" after all those years of being controlled by ""girls who emasculated me by never putting out"", he deserves to have final say in the bedroom because he ""lets"" me have a say in all other aspects of our relationship, that he can't wait to see the look on my face when I finally give in and ""have to take my first load in your mouth"", he's asked repeatedly how long I thought I could hold out before I'd be desperate enough to beg him to do whatever he wanted, that he was going to make me ""earn"" his dick back, and once out of the blue he said ""I guess now you know why I was a virgin when we met"". When called on comments like that he clams up and refuses to discuss them or even clarify what he means. They're like verbal hit-and-runs. 

  

This is honestly a side of him I've never had reason to suspect existed. I would have said we've always resolved our disagreements respectfully and maturely but now in retrospect I'm realizing we've just never had a disagreement about something important to me. I usually make a concession because it doesn't feel like a big deal and I like making him happy. 

  

Right now I'm feeling like I've made a huge mistake marrying him. I don't know how to come back from this or if I even want to but I never would have committed to this man if I hadn't meant it. I need some perspective on the situation badly. 




   
**tl;dr**: husband doesn't want to have his first orgasm inside of me during my fertile days, despite being the one who wants to conceive ASAP and comments he's made since the disagreement have turned me off completely.

"I broke up with her: My girlfriend [23F] is raging angry because I [23M] slept with someone else when I thought we were broken up.


Okay so this is a quick update post to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mczd5/my_girlfriend_23f_is_raging_angry_because_i_23m/ post I made.

tldr of old post: tl;dr: Girlfriend broke up with me, I slept with someone else, she said she didn't ""really"" break up with me, she was just angry. Is angry at me and calling me a cheater.

Update:

I decided to permanently and formally end things with her, this time the break up is permanent and clear on all sides.  I decided to do it for a number of reasons

* Her asking that I cut contact with my friends.  While I think this was a fair respect from her point of view given what happened, I would not be able to hold myself to it.

* I think we both want different things for our long term and short term futures, for example she wants marriage sooner rather than later, whereas for me its more of a 'maybe' thing for maybe when I'm in my 30's.

* Most of all, I felt our relationship had run its course.  Yes we were together a very long time, 8 years, but I've come to the realisation that I was still in that relationship only because of a sense of familiarity, not because I actually wanted to be in that relationship.  I feel the love had fizzled out and I was no longer in love with her.  I think the relationship had been dying for a while and I was just afraid to admit that.  The fact that I slept with someone else so soon is evidence of that.

It wasn't easy, she didn't take it well, I don't blame her, 8 years.  There were lots of tears, but I'm sure she'll get over it. Life goes on.


   
**tl;dr**: We broke up!"
"I (22F) recently got a new job and only just told my best friend (22F). She's upset because she thinks I still resent her because she ""stole a job"" from me and I didn't tell her so we wouldn't have the same situation again (she's right on both counts).


Hey everyone. Apologies in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I'm on my phone. Also apologies to the relative high-school pettiness of this rant. 

A bit of background about my friend (Carol) and I. We met together when we first starting working at a fast food restaurant when we were 15. We've moved on from those jobs, to different companies and I've noticed that she tends to be one ""step"" above me in terms of how much she makes, and what sort of company she works for. For example, my previous job was in fast fashion and Carol worked in luxury - and got paid more as well. I absolutely have no issue with this and I was happy with the pay/effort ratio I had (she put in a lot more work). Another thing is that we both live at home with our families. I'm lucky enough that I don't have to pay anything (phone bills, car, insurance etc. are all mine, but I don't need to pay to live at home. All my money that I make is essentially spending money), while my Carol's family isn't as well off. She regularly needs to chip in for groceries, petrol money, that sort of stuff, but we sort of end up at around the same level of discretionary income as she makes more. 

So about a year ago, a really exciting job ad posted up. I was qualified for the role, it paid insanely well compared to most of the entry level jobs I had worked before, the hours were perfect to go along with university classes as well, the list goes on. I was incredibly excited about getting this job, and I thought I had a good shot at it as well. I sent a link and my resume to Carol for her to look over, and make sure everything sounded good, as I've done for her a couple of times. She came up with a few changes which I was happy with, and around an hour, she sent me a ""Btw I applied as well haha!"" 

I wasn't exactly happy about this, and there's nothing I could really say at the time (I said good luck or something like that), so I just let it slide and we didn't really talk about it. The interviews come and go, and I've been notified that I wasn't successful, but guess who got the job? Carol. 

The HR person at the time said that they really wanted to have me on, but they only had one position. They took down my details and promised to follow up with something soon. I know this means I didn't come across as compelling of a candidate than Carol, but I'm fairly sure that we're both very compelling employees. We both have excellent work ethic, and both of us make more than many of our friends. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think I would've gotten the job if it weren't for Carol. 

At the time I was really miffed, but again, I wasn't in a position to be legitimately mad at her. This new job meant she had some more time to herself while keeping the same amount of money which was really good for her, but I also really wanted that job. Eventually I let it go, but I can't deny I was incredibly salty.

Around a year has passed since that event, and around a month I got a LinkedIn invite from the HR person I was dealing with who now worked at a competitors company (a larger and better paying company at that). Basically, she wanted me to apply for a similar position at her company, which I went for. I'm happy to say that I just received my offer, and I told my friend.

Her first reaction was something like ""How come you didn't tell me, I'm meant to be your best friend, I could've helped you"". She seemed genuinely upset that I didn't tell her about the process, and I don't have any doubts as to her true intentions - but her lack of awareness as to whether it would make me upset or not irks me the most. EDIT: I didn't tell her about being approached for the role. I came up with some weak excuse about how I didn't want to jinx it, but she later asked if it was because I didn't want her to poach this job from her, and if I still resented her from when she ""stole"" the first job. I of course said no to her. 

She is absolutely right though, I didn't let her know about anything because I didn't want her to swoop in and steal it like last time, and the only reason I did that is because I still feel like she overstepped her boundaries in applying for a job that I wanted really badly.

I know of course that it's ridiculous for me to restrict her employment ""because I said so"", but I can't help but feel upset that she did so anyway. The fact that she thought that this was a reason I'd be upset is indicative that she knew taking the job would make me upset, and she only offered a single ""Sorry haha, something better will come along"" at the time. Of course, something has, and I've kept my old job up until now so I wasn't unemployed or anything.

I feel like I'm being very unreasonable, but I can't seem to shake off this feeling of resentment. Carol hasn't messaged me back after I said ""of course not"" to her questions, and it's been almost a day. We usually spend a couple of hours max. not messaging each other. I feel like her reaction sort of decides what happens from here, and I hope she's apologetic (and I know she has no obligation to do so) and has the ""I had no idea you felt like this"" revelation rather than going on the defensive. I have no idea if I'm being a drama queen or not, and I don't know how to patch things up with Carol.



  
**tl;dr**: My friend applied for a job that I was super excited to get, she got it instead of me. I've sort of held it against her, and it led to me not telling her I got a new job like hers until the very last moment. She asked if it was because I resented her - the answer is yes but I didn't tell her that. I'd like to patch things up, but I also want her to apologise. 

EDIT: cleared up some clarity about being approached (I didn't tell Carol about that part) and her ""obliviousness"""
"My [26m] parents [50s m&amp;f] took my childhood from me along with thousands of dollars. Haven't heard from them in 5 years and now they want to apologize...


Avid redditor, using a throwaway  since friends know my main and I am beyond pissed off right now.

So growing up my parents were obsessed with money and even though they couldn't keep down jobs, my mother was constantly  getting  new retail jobs and quitting  because it was too stressful  while my dad just kept getting  fired, my older sister and I had to work as soon as possible. When we were both 12 we had jobs as gold caddies and gave our parents our pay. That wasn't much but as soon as we turned 16 they demanded  that we both get full time jobs on top of school.

They told us that half of our paychecks went to the family and that they would give the rest of our earnings as an allowence  as needed. Even though my sister and I would work over 40 hours a week (we both had two jobs) we couldn't afford work or school clothes because our parents said  it wasn't in the budget. It came to a head when they started going to marriage  counseling  and began to have date nights (on our dime). We also were not allowed to drive so they took us where we needed to go.
   
My sister left home after she graduated  high  school  and joined the navy. She also told our parents to shove it when they asked for her last paycheck  before she left as ""living expenses"". They disowned  her and refused me to have any contact. We would speak through letters that she would write me and send to her friend's  house. Since I was the only one with a real income and pretty much brainwashed by them, my parents told me that I would need to increase my hours so I did what they said.

When I was 17 I worked for five hours every morning  at a donut shop before school, went to class, then worked a fast good job when class got out and double shifts over the weekend. My grades were shit so my dad had the brilliant  idea that I drop out and work full time at both places! I regret doing that every day and when my sister found out half a year she was livid and wanted me to live with her.

When I told them I was moving out they begged me to stay and my dad even cried and told me I was the only one keeping  our family off the street and that my sister just wanted to ruin everything. After I left they disowned  me as well when I told them I couldn't  send them money.

It was hard for awhile but my sister and her husband  let me live with them rent free as long as I studied for my GED  and helped out around the house. Years later my life is much better, I have my GED, I'm an assistant  manager  at my job, I take a couple online courses, and my own apartment  with my partner and 2 year old daughter.

Two nights ago I was mindlessly  browsing Facebook  when I got a message from a shared account the belonged to my parents. They don't even look like the same people that I grew up with. My mom works at a chruch  while my dad works for the city they live in as a grounds keeper. They told me that they were sorry for the way they treated my sister and I growing  up, that they were terrible  parents (I agree with that), and that they will have to life with what they did for the rest of their lives. They invited me to go out to lunch with them and they want me to bring my family with me if I wish.

I called my sister and she got the same message from them along with a friend of their telling  her how they are changed people  who ""deserve"" a second chance. Right now I am just seeing red and can't even  think straight. I want to tell them to fuck  off but at the same time I want to see them face to face and get an explanation. I'm a parent now and I can't even imagine  making my kid quit school  to support  me! Some outside  opinions would be great.

"I [21 F] woke up at 2:30 am to my boyfriend [21 M] groping and attempting to finger me while I was asleep. He claims he was asleep... Not sure how to proceed.


Hello, Reddit. Weirdest morning/night of my life... 

I just started dating this guy a couple weeks ago. He's great! Attentive, caring, smart, funny, sweet, put together, and sexy as hell, basically everything I've ever wanted. We've slept in the same bed together before  (maybe 5 times) and nothing like this has ever happened.

Last night, before we fell asleep, he was doing normal boyfriend things and groping me and kissing me. I wasn't really in the mood, but didn't know how to verbalize it, so I moved his hand away and shifted into a more cuddle-friendly (not grope-friendly) position. He kissed my shoulder and said, ""you can tell me no, you know, I'll listen."" I turned and kissed him and told him I was really tired and not in the mood, but maybe tomorrow morning if he had time before work. He kissed me back, said that was perfectly okay and shifted around a bit to get into a more comfortable sleeping position. He sleeps naked, I sleep in panties. 

That was around midnight. Fast forward to 2:30... I'm fading in and out of sleep, thinking I'm having a sex dream, because it felt like he was groping me and thrusting against me. Then I felt a hand go into my panties. At that point, I'm wide awake wondering what the fuck is going on. His hands change from holding my hips and thrusting against my ass (couldn't tell if there was an erection or not, was too shocked), and slipping into my panties and kind of gliding along my vulva/slightly entering my vagina. His other hand is groping my boobs. Thinking he's trying to initiate sex, I take his hand that's on my hips and move it back. It immediately goes back to its position and then goes for my panties. I lifted his hand one last time and the same thing happened. Due to past sexual assault trauma (which I have told him about), I froze, feeling terrified and very vulnerable. So now I'm staring at the wall, frozen, while my boyfriend attempts to finger me and is giving me a friction rash on my ass from his pubic hair and shit rubbing up against it so forcefully and often. I lay still for a couple minutes. He's not saying anything and it's pitch black dark. I finally get the courage to get out of bed to pee. He doesn't seem phased and rolls over. 

I pee and try to figure out what the fuck just happened. Why was he doing that when I was asleep, did he know that I was asleep? Why didn't he listen when I moved his hand back? He didn't say anything, Is he asleep? What the fuck is going on... So I washed my face and went back to bed. He rolled back over to spoon me and placed his hands on my hips again. They started to slide down and, thinking he was going for my panties again, I moved his hand back. He made a weird sigh/grunt and rolled back over. I sat there wondering wtf just happened. 

We woke up before he had to go to work and I asked him ""what do you remember about last night?"" he looked very confused. So I explained everything and he claimed he doesn't remember anything except me coming back to bed and not wanting to cuddle. Okay... 

When I told him, he took it pretty hard. He actually stayed long enough to be significantly late for work and even cried once, saying he didn't know what the fuck happened, but he didn't ever want to lose me or hurt me. He also said that when I told him about the sexual assault, all he wanted to do was make it better, but not he feels like he's the cause of my pain. I told him I need to process this and he left for work. 

So... What the fuck? I know people can have sex in their sleep but... What the fuck? I feel very violated but at the same time, he genuinely did not seem to remember what happened. I don't know what to think or feel. It's bringing up a lot of unwanted memories and makes me feel confused. How do I approach this? Is this even a thing? He seemed genuinely confused and I don't want to penalize the guy for something he did in his sleep. He used to live with his ex for a whole year (sleeping in the same bed) and he said she never mentioned anything like that.

TL;DR: new boyfriend groped, humped, and attempted to finger me in my sleep. He says he doesn't remember it and seems genuinely upset about what happened. I don't know how to feel or how to approach this... Help? "
"My [29/F] husband's [31/M] bizarre behavior is destroying our relationship. Am I over-reacting?


EDIT: WOW. This blew up way more than I anticipated. I'm sorry to the people that I haven't been able to respond to, but I've read most of your comments and I appreciate (most of) them. I wasn't looking for any sort of diagnosis, but the overwhelming support in my feeling that he would strongly, strongly benefit from therapy has solidified my decision to push the matter. I'm going out of town for a week, but I'm going to talk to him when I get back. I'm going to follow some advice and look up some local specialists and present it to him when we're both in a good head-space, so he knows it's serious and that it's not just something I throw out at the end of an argument. Perhaps I'll post on update when there's something to update on. Cheers, Reddit.

Throw-away, as husband knows my reddit account.

Hey Reddit, I'm hoping some unbiased outsiders opinions might help me get some clarity in my current predicament. I'm super sorry if this is long, I *REALLY* appreciate you taking the time, because all of the advice from my friends is pretty much 'that sucks, move home' which is neither particularly helpful nor what I want.

A little bit of history: My husband and I have been married for one year, together for three years. I've always known he has bad social anxiety, which I've always been really supportive of (I myself often battle the anxiety monster). Recently, for his work, we moved from North America to Europe. Our relationship has always been super solid. We have always been completely honest with one-another. No history of lies, infidelity, manipulation. Nothing. Up until recently, I thought we were two solid peas in a pod.

Okay, so, I was understanding for the first month when he'd act extremely panicked when we'd leave the house, but we've been here for four months now and his behavior has gone from panicked to, in my opinion, straight up bizarre and it's both worrying me and completely driving a wedge between us. I sleep on the couch most nights, now. 

He'd been having really aggressive and confusing outbursts pretty much non-stop, but again, I was trying to be understanding that it's probably just his anxiety getting the best of him, but the event that caused me to start sleeping on the couch was this:

- One of my favourite bands that I've been trying to see for 10 years was in town, and also playing at this super cool local venue I'd been dying to check out. So I was really excited, and it was a pretty big deal for me. We're at the venue having some beers and getting along great, when I ask him if he knows where the bathroom is (it should be noted now that this venue is underground, and has some an upstairs/outside patio bar area, and there are two entrances to the downstairs, but I was only aware of one at the time), he says ""it's just upstairs then first door on the left"". So I walk up the only stairs that I'm aware of and see no other doors anywhere. So I wander around for a while and finally find the bathrooms. I come back down, and in completely good-spirits say:
Me: Trying to lead me on a wild-goose chase, eh? The bathrooms weren't exactly to the left. Haha.
Him: Yes, they are.
Me: No way, man, you have to walk all the way around the building.
Him: Oh, which stairs did you go up?
Me: The stairs we came down from originally, aren't they the only ones?
Him: No, there's some over there behind that door*points*
Me: Ooooh! Shit yeah, I didn't even know those were there. Whoops.
Him: Yes, you did. You just used them.
Me: Umm. . . no, I didn't know they existed until you literally just pointed to them.
Him: Why are you lying to me?!
Me: What?! Do you want me to explain the exact path I took to the bathrooms? Dude, I don't even know there those stairs go. I legitimately didn't know they existed until just now.
Him: Yes you fucking did! I know you used them! Why are you lying to me? I saw you walk through that door!
Me: I definitely did not use that door. What does it matter, though, it's just a door. Can we move on?
Him: No! Why are you fucking with me! Why are you trying to make me feel crazy?!
Me (getting concerned at this point): Hey, are you okay? What's really going on?
Him: You're fucking lying to me! You're doing this on purpose! I demand you explain it to me! Why are you trying to make me feel crazy?
The conversation carried on like this for a while. He wouldn't drop it. He storms out a few times, storms back, humiliates me, ruins the night, and I end up leaving with him.

Now, typically in one those standard ""Who ate the last piece of bread?"" arguments where both parties deny it, I'll just say ""Yeah it was possibly me"" to avoid the argument, I'd rather be happy than right all the time. But the fact is, I absolutely didn't even know those stairs existed and I felt like giving in and lying to calm him  down would be enabling some pretty fucked-up behavior, so I didn't. And I wondered, is this how it's going to be every time I don't bend to his will to avoid confrontation? So I told him that if he didn't see a therapist, I couldn't be with him. He absolutely refused, and said it was not an option he would ever consider (even though I've gone to therapy many times and there is absolutely no shame about it in our household). After I told him that I could no longer live like this and would not be sleeping in the same room as him anymore, we finally made an agreement: if he ever had another outburst again, he would agree to go to therapy. Me, thinking nobody can just change their behavior overnight, agreed. It wasn't a matter of 'if', it was a matter of 'when'. 

Now, to his credit, a month has passed and he hasn't had another super aggressive outburst, but he's channeling that bizarre/obsessive behavior into other aspects of his life, and he's having minor 'fits' all the time. In my opinion, many of his behaviors count as further 'outbursts', but he's refusing to go to therapy. 

To try to avoid rambling, I'll do a point-form list of some examples just from the last few days:

- We're going to the grocery store and when he was about to grab a basket I said ""Oh I actually have my cloth bag, we can just use that ask a basket and then we know we won't buy too much to fit"", to which he responds ""Oh, it's no big deal, let's just get a basket"". A perfectly normal interaction. Until I start putting canned beans into the basket and he starts getting extremely agitated about how he thought I just wanted to get enough for the cloth bag, I explained how I thought he meant we should get more when we got the basket, he responds that he /did/ in fact mean that, so I'm confused as to why he's upset. He just keeps repeating ""I just thought you only wanted enough for the cloth bag, that's what you said. And now you're getting more than will fit in the cloth bag. It's just not what you said!"". I tried to calm him down by saying we can just ask for an extra bag at checkout, or put the extra items back, and he made it clear neither of those things were the point. He just kept repeating ""You said you wanted just enough for the cloth bag, and then you changed it!"". I had no idea what he was actually upset about.

- Grocery store again, I'm looking for tea. He starts breathing really heavily and clenching his fists like he was trying to contain his anger. I figured maybe he was getting anxious (even though we'd been in this store probably 30 times at this point and it wasn't busy at all) so I said ""Sorry if this is taking a while, I'm sure it's here somewhere, just a second"" to which he started ranting on: ""Take however long you want, it's fine, you just didn't tell me you wanted fennel tea. What am I supposed to do? I didn't know you wanted fennel tea."" Me, a bit stunned, respond ""Okay. . . I'll just be another second, I know it's here.""
At this point he was borderline crying, and stormed out of the store. He was furious when I got home, and could not explain why, he just kept repeating that he wasn't anticipating me looking for that tea. He could not explain to me why it upset him. 

I could go on, and on, but this is already long enough. A couple more quick notes that might be relevant: He *obsessively* needs to finish what he's saying at all times, no matter what. Even if he's trying to tell me where he left a note for me and I say I already got it, he *has to* finish explaining it in detail.  He's also become *extremely* sensitive to any perceived aggression (like I can't raise my voice to talk to him even if he has headphones on and I'm just trying to tell him that dinner is ready). It's enough to make him cry.

I'm so unhappy, and I just don't know what to do. He's always been such a gentle person, and I don't want to abandon him if he really does need help, but he just won't listen to me.



So, Reddit? Am I over-reacting? Is his behavior normal for somebody with social anxiety? Am I right for feeling he needs to talk to a therapist?
   
**TL;DR: My husband's social anxiety has evolved into aggressive, bizarre behavior since we moved overseas for work. I think he needs therapy and that there's likely something more than social anxiety afoot, he refuses. Uncertain how to move forward.**

"I [28F] just found a ""secret"" folder my husband [29M--married 3 years] had on our computer. It has THOUSANDS of pictures of a celebrity, as well as letters, fictional writings of his and her ""life,"" as well as some X rated recordings of himself. I'm creeped out--what do I do?


Preface...I thought I was married to the perfect guy. He's handsome, charming, athletic as well as a published fiction writer. He's very, very creative in terms of photography, painting and writing. I'm far more right brain so I thought we made a good match.

When we met I knew he has a ""celeb-crush"" on a certain famous actress. I can name her if its relevant but she's kind of like the it girl right now...very beautiful and I had no issues with my husband crushing on a gorgeous woman from afar.

I needed the computer today to find some tax documents and in a folder from our 2014 taxes buried pretty deep was a folder simply titled ""Jen."" I knew right away who it was referencing and if anything I clicked on to give him some good natured ribbing later on.

When I clicked on it there were several sub folders. I would say there are easily 10000 pictures of her in this folder, including ones from the big hacking that took place a few years ago. In another folder where copies of letters he's apparently written to her...id say 20 or 30 total...the last one dated to congratulate her on the movie that just came out. All this is strange but...

In another folder was fiction he'd written about he and she being married, who they would be friends with, where they would live and where they would travel. I only read one of these but there were about 12 stories, I'm guessing about 20-30 pages each. 

The worst thing was he has recorded his voice while talking kind of third person about him having sex with her. There were dozens and dozens of these. I could only handle listing to parts of two of them...one was ""sweet"" and ""romantic,""  the other was a very violent fantasy similar to a role play I have done with him on a few occasions. 

he doesn't know that i know, I left a text saying I would be at my moms and maybe spending the night to help with my nephew who lives with her. I can't handle being around him and I don't even know how to approach this. If a friend's husband had done this my advice would be to leave immediately...but it's not that easy when I'm in the middle of it. 

Very frankly...what do I do?
   
**tl;dr**: Husband has a massive collection of pictures, fantasy stories and even audio of himself describing sexual fantasies with a certain celebrity. I'm creeped out but have no idea what to do.

Edit: wow sorry I had no idea this would blow up..,comments are locked so I can't answer anything. To the top post...I vaguely remember her in terms of hair and eye color and general build but could never be mistaken for her. 

I will approach in a non accusatory manner in person with this as soon as we both get home this evening.  Thank you for rhe advice every one. "

"[UPDATE] My [21F] parents [38F &amp; 37M] do not discipline my brothers [6M &amp; 9M] and it's becoming a problem


Hey Reddit, I just wanted to give a short update if anyone cares about my situation. With some help from Reddit and me finally deciding to be an adult, things have improved.  

Here is the original:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4c1pxf/my_21f_parents_38f_37m_do_not_discipline_my/?


I finally sat down with my parents about a week after I made the original post and explained to them my concerns about their lack of discipline towards my brothers. It ended up being a long, heated and emotional conversation that I won't go into too much detail about but there was a lot of things my parents were hiding from me. Including a suicide attempt from by my mother about a year and half ago. My parents agreed that we would do family therapy and my mother will start to take her medications and go to a therapist on her own time. My mom explained to that she misses me a lot and we agreed that I would come home 2 times a month or she would come spend a weekend with every month, we would facetime weekly and text everyday. She also took a new part time job, which I know makes her happy.

My parents agreed that they would start to discipline my brothers more, after I showed them a detailed list of dates and incidents where they did not in the past year. In the two months since the post, their behavior has been met with almost appropriate discipline. My parents are working toward making themselves better parents. 


With a lot of argument my parents have let me take Molly in, she is adjusting to her new home nicely and hopefully she will be returned with my parents and brothers when things have calmed down at home. 

All in all, we are working together to make a better family. Thank you Reddit for your advice. 

TL:DR - My parents agreed to go to family therapy and discipline my brothers as well. We are working together to make things better for everyone. "

"[UPDATE] My (19f) psychotic symptoms are affecting my job performance. I'm afraid I'm going to be fired if I don't explain what's going on.


I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nlgm4/my_19f_psychotic_symptoms_are_affecting_my_job/) a few days ago, discussing my fear of getting fired over developing psychotic symptoms. It's been a roller coaster of a few days, but my situation is slowly having an amazing upturn. 

I managed to get to work for my 8-hour shift on Sunday, after apologizing to my bosses for the millionth time. I worked for a few hours until they both came in for the afternoon. They called me to the back and I braced myself, waiting for the worst. 

As soon as they closed the door... they both gave me a big hug! My head manager said that my asst. manager had told her everything that had happened on Friday night and that she could tell that my personality had been changing. She said that it seemed like I was struggling with something that was out of my control, but that I remained an excellent worker and someone they didn't want to let go of. My asst. manager backed up everything she said and told me, ""I know I criticize you often, but you've always been dependable and we don't want your illness to get in the way of doing your job, which you've been so good at doing up until now.""

They said that I didn't need to disclose any personal medical information, but that they would work with me if my doctors found any accommodations to be helpful to me. And they let me get back to work! With job security! I felt so much better and was able to get through the day. 

And I went to my first psychiatry appointment on Monday and it went great. I've been seeing a therapist daily for CBT since then to reduce symptoms of psychosis and I will be on meds by the end of the week. Even better news: my psychiatrist doesn't think I have schizophrenia, but a psychotic disorder NOS. So I will have a better chance at controlling my symptoms and getting back to normal :) I'm confident I can handle my illness with time and patience. Thank you for all your help!

TL;DR I wasn't fired and it looks like I'll keep my job! + good leeway on my treatment. Everything is looking up and I'm taking things a day at a time"

"My fiance (24M) may smash cake in my (22F) face at our wedding.


Honestly this seems so silly to me. I've been dating my fiance for almost five years and we're getting married in November. We're on the same page about everything else wedding-related. Small wedding, short ceremony, fun party reception after. I've ended up planning most everything which isn't a big deal. The small details are important to me and not that important to him, so he's left me mostly in charge of what we do. Obviously we discussed colors, cake flavor, party favors, budget, etc. I've gotten quite a but planned ad showed him everything, and he's on board. 


Now one think I love love love about my fiance is his sense of humor. People probably listen to us and think we hate each other, cause we constantly rag on each other and talk shit. It's all in good fun, but a lot of our humor and jokes to one another are kinda at the expense of us. It probably sounds bad, but we always know when to stop. 


Now, I'm afraid that my fiance is going to take it too far. Even before we were engaged, I've said a million times that when I get fed cake at my wedding, no effing way would it be smashed in my face. I feel like it would be humiliating, it would ruin my hair and makeup, and maybe even my dress, and I just think it's disrespectful. And this is coming from a girl who got shoved into a mud puddle and had to walk around the rest of the day half muddy and LAUGHED. 


I've told my fiance several times ""no cake smashing!"" The first time I said it, his response was ""but it would be so funny!"" I told him in no uncertain terms that it was NOT funny to me. He agreed, but I'm suspicious it was just to placate me. 


I try not to bring it up too much in case it makes him annoyed or feel like I don't trust him, but every time he days ""okay, okay...I still think it would be funny."" It just leaves a pit in my stomach that he may still do it. 


So what do I do? I've made it very clear I am not okay with this and I still fear he may do it. I'm hoping if I get enough people agreeing with me I can show him this and show that people hate it. Or maybe I'm just being a downer. Idk. I would be pretty unhappy if it happened. 


Tl;dr: my fiance thinks it's funny to shove cake in people's faces at weddings but it's humiliating to me. I'm afraid he's going to do it."
"Is it bad that I [19M] don't want a relationship with my new step-mother?


My father recently remarried.  The new woman is my step-mom.  My father and mother had a divorce 4 years ago because my dad was having an affair and the woman he married now is the woman he was having an affair with.

The divorce was extremely difficult for me mentally and emotionally.  For a long time I found it difficult to forgive my father, but then I did forgive him, because, well, he is my father, and I love him dearly.  He did something wrong and betrayed my mother, but I still love him very much, he is my father.

However, now the woman he's marrying is the woman he betrayed my mother with.  The woman who wrecked our home and our family.  I feel strange emotions towards her, anger and hatred, even though I've barely even met her.

Needless to say I do not want her as my step mom and I did not want my dad to marry.  He made his choice and chose to marry her, its his choice.  But I don't want to accept her as my step mother, I don't want to ever have a relationship with her or even speak with her.

I moved out of home permanently when I found out my dad was going to marry her and she was going to move in with us.  I moved out for that reason and now I'm renting with friends.

My mother and my father keep pushing me to put the past in the past and just be nice to this woman and accept her as my step mother.  But I don't want to, I don't want to accept her as my anything, I don't want to be nice to her or even speak to her.

What they did was horrible, and I am not obliged to forgive them. I forgive my father because he's my father and I love him, but she is nothing to me, I don't have to forgive her. I still hate her.

My parents keep pushing me to accept her as my step-mom and be nice to her, but I don't want to at all.  Am I bad for doing that? Am I in the wrong here? Do I not have the right to refuse to have a relationship with someone if I don't want to?

They were both really good and I owe them everything in my life. They didn't have to take care of me, they were kids themselves but they had us stick together and I grew up with family in a loving home.

Now I'm getting married soon. Well. This question exists. Who should walk me down the isle? The eldest brother? They're only 11 month apart. They had an equal role in raising me and I love them equally. I don't want to pick one over the other. Will it be weird if I have them both do it at the same time, one on my left one on my right?

"Is this a red flag and demonstration of disrespect or am I [24F] exaggerating (upd4te)


tl;dr(1st post): bf K thinks I (Podiatry student) should stick with treating fungal nail infections and that I shouldn't try and help someone because clearly I can't know other medical things. 




**Original:** https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lya9f/is_this_a_red_flag_and_demonstration_of/




So things took a weird turn. Initially I was going to give him all of my previous lectures and notes from uni so that he could see that we get taught basically everything and that way he could understand. I was waiting for my break to do it properly. But K (bf) got sick. 


He didn't want to see a doctor even though I tried talking him into one several times. I decided to look at it myself and welp he had hemorrhoids. I told him to get some laxatives and even got him some drinkable fiber and ointment to help with the pain. I told him what to eat and what not to eat to help relieve it. 


Although he did start drinking the fiber drink, he didn't control his diet. Continued eating junk and spicy foods. Didn't eat any veg or fruit. Didn't get laxatives and didn't use the ointment either. 


The pain gradually got worse such that he was in severe pain the entire day and night. I was still encouraging him to see a doc but had given up actually getting through to him. 


 K starts talking to one of his friends whos an intern (med student) and well this guy tells him he should go to the emergency because he probably has thrombosis. 


My stupid bf starts telling me how he has to rush to the doctors because of this and how his friend is so smart and other shit I didn't care enough to listen. 


I tell this idiot that the likelihood of him having thrombotic hemorrhoids is very low. He starts telling me that a- Im not a doctor so I shouldn't make such comments and 2.  when the doctor tells us that he has thrombosis that Im going to look so stupid. 



Anyone want to bet what he had ? Yeah NOT freaking thrombosis!. 


His doctor gave him laxatives and ointments for the hemorrhoid along with ""stop eating junk food stupid, eat fiber"" talk. 


I was so pissed. He couldn't even visit a doctor even though I pleaded with him  several times over and over again. 


But the moment the friend tells him to see a doctor hes rushing to visit one! His friend didn't even examine him yet his advice was more valuable than any of mine. 



 
I think he could tell I was pissed afterwards because he started telling me how ""smart"" I am. And how lucky he is to have someone like me. He started getting goofy with ""when are we going to move in together and get married so you can look after me properly"" I told him to go move in with his intern friend. They'd get along better. 


I don't think this is going to work. Im done trying to prove myself to him. If he has this little interest in anything I say, its not going to change. And I can't be with someone who disrespects me this much. 
   

I haven't had the talk with him yet but judging by how hes constantly calling and trying to be goofy/sweet I think he knows its coming. So thats it 


thanks guys.

"My (f/25) fiancé's (m/25) father (m/53) asked me to not ""force"" his son to marry me, need advice.


My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years, since college. We are very happy in the relationship and have been even more so since we got engaged.

We are getting married later this year and the issue is with his father. The other day he approached me and asked me to stop trying to force my fiancé to marry me when he is so young. When I asked him what he meant he said that he does not believe his son is old enough to start a family yet, and while he understands I might be under pressure from my ""bio clock"", I should be more understanding. This conversation made me few really strange. I don't know what my next move should be. Should I talk to my fiancé? To his father or to his mother? What should I say? 

Tl;dr: fiancé's father is asking me to stop forcing his son to marry me and I don't know how to proceed. 

EDIT: I know I will be asked these questions, so I'll just summarize here:

- I absolutely am not forcing anyone to do anything, my fiancé has always been very excited about getting married to me. He was the first one to start the conversation and has indicated at every step of the way that he wants us to be husband and wife.

- Once again my fiancé has no reason to feel ""pressured"". Believe it or not some men are way more eager than some women to start a family. HE was the one who wanted to get married and he was the one who decided it will be this year. So yeah, no.

- We both are very financially stable - great jobs, own cars, no debt, in the next couple years should save enough to buy our own house, even though neither of us minds renting apartments. 

- His parents got married when his father was 26 and his mother was 20. They are still together, but I think he might be projecting.

- I am not looking for an opinion about whether or not we are to young to get married. I understand that you and I might have differing views on the subject, but my fiancé and I have already made up our mind. The only advice I need is about how to deal with the future in-laws so that our relationship is not completely ruined. 

- To everyone here who wonders why I haven't talked to my fiancé yet. His father approached me about it two days ago. My fiancé is currently on a business trip abroad (in his line of work he has to travel every 2-3 months for about a week or so), and I don't want to worry him because I know he is incredibly busy. I'm waiting for him to get back tomorrow, since I want to discuss it in person. "

But I'm going to do it anyway, because I was actually surprised by a lot of the comments that I received. Here is what happened.

In the original post, I berated myself for having been naive, having fallen for him, having started anything in the workplace, etc. I was hurting a lot, and I was looking for the affirmation that it wasn't my fault, and that the guy that I was involved with was actually a jerk, which Reddit confirmed. But a lot of the comments also said that I was being too hard on myself, and that I wasn't loving myself.

I've had a pretty successful career so far, I've had way more successes than failures, and so I have a very high self-esteem (or so I thought), so these comments were a surprise to me. One comment in particular really stood out. The comment said, **Think about your situation as if it were happening to a friend, or to your little sister. You wouldn't hate her. You'd want to give her a hug. Treat yourself with that same compassion, okay?** Other comments were approximately the same thing, ""Be kind to yourself,"" ""stop blaming yourself,"" etc.

And that really struck a chord with me. If it were my little sister going through what I've gone through instead of me, I would NEVER say any of the things that I said on the post. I would want her to indulge herself, go out with her friends, go on dates, and just have fun! I thought that I already loved myself, but I wasn't being loving enough to me!

So I basically followed my own advice that I'd give to anyone that I care. I bought myself some things that I have been wanting for months! I started going through some jazz piano lessons that I've been meaning to learn for ages (I'm a classical pianist who is secretly a jazz groupie). I tried out several new restaurants that I've wanted to go to with my best friend, and we also went out to see a concert. I had a couple of friends over and we chatted and baked cookies and had some wholesome fun. I also went out for social gatherings to meet some new people, and also went on a date, and during the past week or so, FIVE men told me that I was cute/pretty/beautiful. Okay, one of them was my date, but two of them were random men on the street who didn't even have to talk to me!

I'm obviously still kinda sorta hurting from the fact that someone I thought was my friend had betrayed/disrespected me that much, and I really hope that his life brings him a lot of misery, but he is really out of my life completely and I won't be there to see it, so it doesn't matter a whole lot. AND I am so much happier already.

So this is why I decided to write this update, Reddit.

I think it's really difficult not to be hard on yourself when going through something like a breakup, especially in the cases in which you didn't do anything wrong but the other person was a jerk. If you're going through some difficult times, I hope that you will all take a step back, and ask yourself, if it were your loved one going through your situation, what would you tell them to do? And I hope that you do exactly that for yourself. Doing that will also shift the focus onto how to make yourself happy, and not on how to make some external factor miserable (and this is something you have no control over), and I found that it was very helpful for my mental well-being. Honestly, you can never love yourself enough.

Thank you, Reddit. I feel like I learned such an important life lesson from a throwaway post that I wrote in a half-crazed state of misery. For that lesson, everything I went through for the past month was really worth it. It would make me even happier if I am able to pay that feeling forward, and that is why I am writing this update. I'm writing this in the hopes that someone else who is going through a similar situation as I just did stumbles upon this post, that this post will make them get better.

I love you, Reddit! Thank you so, so, so much! Have a great weekend (what's left of it), and I hope you have a great week! I know I will :)

"Boyfriend (25M) of almost 4 months dumped me (25F) over a stupid autocorrect mistake


Ugh repost because I forgot the title the first time, ignore that one.

I'm posting because this is totally ridiculous and I would like suggestions on how to get through to him or if I should just let this go.

We were at my place earlier tonight and I was in the shower. When I got out I found a note from him that says: ""So how long did you think you could keep your real job a secret from me? Glad I didn't get in too deep. This is done, don't try to contact me.""

My job is a hybrid one as a freelance photographer, designer, and model. A lot of my friends are very artsy and into design and fashion and such, if they have projects or if there are other people trying to sell handmade jewelry or clothing, I model the items for their websites, ads, etc.

I had no idea what my boyfriend was talking about until I opened my phone to call him and found it already open to a text conversation with a client I just got yesterday. That woman wanted me to model and had told me she'd be in contact when she found a photographer to set up a date to do the shoot. So her text to me came when I was in the shower and it reads ""The pornographer can come this weekend if you want to do our shoot then."" Her phone changed photographer to pornographer and my boyfriend must have seen this text appear on the screen since I left my phone out. I'm assuming he was suspicious and opened it and saw it was from someone he'd never heard me mention as a friend or client and assumed I'm secretly doing porn.

Maybe that's not unreasonable in itself but he has now blocked me on literally every platform we had each other on and could communicate on. He lives about half an hour away so short of taking the subway over there I have no way to talk to him and explain this. 

The thing is I like this guy a lot, we have a lot of fun together and he's smart and creative and I could see us being in a long term relationship. I'm slow-paced in relationships and not madly in love with him or deeply hurt right now, more pissed off and confused. If this is how he handles the slightest misunderstanding, like blocking out all possibility for communication, is that a sign that resolving actual problems in the future won't go well? Should I pursue this and explain the mistake, or should I take it as more of a blessing in disguise?

TL;DR boyfriend broke up with me over a client's autocorrected text that implied I'm in porn without giving me any chance to explain or way to contact him. Is this worth clearing up and continuing the relationship given that this was his reaction?

"Me [29f] with my BF [29M] 3 years. Put on some nice lingerie he acted uninterested then suggested we go without sex for a month, I'm feeling unattractive and very hurt.


Me and Dallas have been together for 3 years. It is great, we have an awesome relationship and time together. Dallas has a high sex drive when it comes to getting off to porn, but not so much with me anymore. He tells me I'm sexy and that he loves having sex with me, but it really doesn't happen. 

He loves lingerie, and I recently got a gift card to the adult store here in town and picked out some of his favorite color lingerie and was super stoked.

We were at home and watching reruns of Cops. I had been rubbing his thigh and he was into it. And then I decided to run into the bathroom and change into my lingerie for some sexy times.

I came out and he was sitting on Facebook, looked up at me and said ""I'm really tired."" then went to bed. And then today he suggested we go until my birthday (end of a July) without sex so that it can be this big exciting build up.

I was at a loss. I don't even know how to proceed here.

TL;DR Surprised BF with sexy lingerie he didn't even look twice, then suggested going without sex for over a month."

"My [25f] brother [27m] lost over 200 pounds. He is now a jerk that people don't want to be around and he thinks people hate him because they are jealous. How can I make him see the truth?


I have been thinking of ways to ask this question  for awhile and every time  I type it out I just delete it because it doesn't  feel right. I love my older brother ""Ryan"" dearly and have always felt  protective  of him. We grew up in a toxic home after our  mom left and our dad married a woman that hated us and told us all the time. I dealt with the situation  with therapy and some acting out as a teen. Ryan used food to cope with his problems and at his heaviest he was a little over 350lbs.

His wakeup call came after a uncle of ours, who was also obese, ended up losing his toes to diabetes. Ryan began working out and dieting hard core along with having lap band surgery. That was three years ago and since then he looks great. He is now more confident, much healthier, and unfortunately, a major jerk who projects  his insecurity  on other people.

On thanksgiving  he was invited to spend the day with a cousin, the daughter of our uncle with diabetes. We were pretty close with her so while my wife and I were helping prepare  dinner she offered to make Ryan a low sugar/ carb meal along with her dad's  so that he could enjoy the holiday as well. During the meal prep he kept hovering over her and telling her how she was killing the other family members  with the unhealthy  meal the others were stuck with, that she was just trying to undo the damage  her dad did to himself. I kept telling him to leave the kitchen and get out but he insisted  on being ""honest"" with her even if it was hard to hear. Finally she just lost her temper and dumped the meal she made him in the trash and told him to leave her home.

My wife and I apologized for his behavior  and the entire meal was just awkward and quiet until we left. That night  I got into an argument  with my brother  and he thinks that he was right and that she should have made the whole family the healthier meal. We didn't speak  to for awhile after that and my cousin deleted him off of her social media accounts.

Now Ryan is out of control with shaming random people he sees, myself, and the few friends he has left. He was actually  banned  from his gym after he took a picture of an overweight  woman  using a treadmill  there and posted it to Facebook with a caption along the lines of  ""putting food in front of them to make them run"". At his new gym he has already caused some drama (don't know the reason yet) but some of the regulars there filed a complaint  against him.

My wife also hates having him around he because of his ""jokes"" and I am sick of it too. He insists  that he isn't being rude but he is just ""honest"" and that the people who are offended are just overly sensitive  and need a reality  check. I am at my wits end. I love my brother and I want to help him but his behavior  is causing a rift in my family  and I don't  want to be stuck in the middle anymore!

   
;tldr; brother lost over 200 pounds. Projects his insecurity  on other people and acts like an ass."
"Me [25 M] with my GF [24 F] of 1.5 years. She brought home a kitten after 9 months of me saying ""No"" - Don't know how to handle things


**EDIT: I just want everyone to know that I have read through most, if not all of your posts and am currently handling the situation at hand. None of you are being ignored and I'm thankful for everything you've shared. I will post a more complete update when I feel a conclusion has been reached. Thanks again.**

For the last 9 months or so, my girlfriend has been asking to get a pet. At first it was a dog or cat and when I said that I didn't think we were ready for it, she would still bring it up until finally backing down - or so I thought. 6 months ago it was her birthday and she brought up getting a pet again, and I responded with the same reasons why:

* Small apartment(which I would like to note that I pay for and is in my name for transparency sake)
* When I was younger I was allergic to cats, so I'm not sure if I will be this time around or to what severity
* I feel our relationship is still too young to commit to a pet
* We have very different work hours, but both each work in surplus of 40 hours a week. Sometimes as much as 60.
* A pet is an expensive thing if you treat them properly and right now I'm very concerned with trying to pay off my student loan debt.
* I did tell her that I certainly want pets in the future, because I grew up with both cats and dogs and love them both, but that time isn't right now.


The week before her birthday, we agreed to get a Fish instead. It would bring life to our apartment, was low maintenance, and felt like a good compromise. On her birthday, when we were going to get one, she told me she didn't want a fish and that she was hoping I'd just reconsider for a cat or dog. So I said once again that I wasn't ready for one and we got into another fight about it.


On and off for the last 6 months she would say that she wanted a Cat and kept saying how low maintenance they are and how she would be the one taking care of it. I insisted that I didn't think we were ready for a pet yet. And that I wouldn't be ready until our living conditions, work schedules, and finances changed a bit - she of course disagreed and we have been arguing about it since... UNTIL


Last night, after I went to work(I work overnights) she messaged me on Facebook and told me that she paid for and brought a kitten home. I was absolutely shocked that she would do this. I feel completely disrespected and like my feelings about it are worthless. 


We argued about it, a lot. At first I didn't know what to say, but felt like I had to seem incredibly upset, because I am, and don't want to make it seem like I'll let this all be ok. But now, we seem to be at a stand still. She says she's keeping the Kitten and I told her to bring it back after work today. 


I do love my girlfriend, but I feel like this violates any kind of partnership I thought we had. She said she thinks I try to act more like a ""figurehead"" in our relationship than a partner, and maybe that is the case, but this certainly isn't what a partnership should be like, right?


**tl;dr**: How should I handle my girlfriend bringing home a kitten after I've been telling her that I don't want one *yet* for the last 9 months?"
"My best friend (27 F) admitted to me that when she was trying on her wedding dress that she called her ex to see if they still had a chance


My best friend (27 F) is getting married in October. She told me recently (after I suspected sadness and pryed it out of her) that as she was trying on her wedding dress that she called her ex and asked if there was still a chance between them. He eventually told her no. 

I told her it wasn't too late to call it off... That I'd be by her side and help her with everything including moving out of her house and starting a new life. She continued to say that she was now happy and moved on, but then contradicts it with comments like ""I don't really want to talk about my wedding because the attention makes me uncomfortable."" 

I think it's more than just cold feet. A part of me knows that she romanticized her last relationship with her ex because he was by her side when her mom tragically died 10 years ago. It was such a difficult time in her life and I know planning her wedding without her mom has been painful because it has brought up raw feelings that she never worked out in her grief. When I brought this up to her she whole heartedly agreed that was the case. 

Her fiancé is not a good match. He is a dud emotionally for her charisma. She told me she dislikes his family, doesn't have good sex and does not like being the breadwinner in the relationship. 

A lot of her family and friends agree with me that she isn't making the right choice but no one wants to confront her. Throughout our 10+ years of friendship I have always been the one giving her my opinions and tough love. Sometimes it's even caused some major conflicts and distance between us. Everyone in her life just assumes I'll be the one to say something. Everyone is waiting on me. I love her to death.. But this is exhausting. 

On another note, I'm also worried about her stress and her health, especially with the long history of cancer in her family. I know there are worse things than divorce, but do I continue to pry when she's defiant or should I sit on the sidelines and watch her make a huge mistake? I've already voiced my opinion. She seems to be set in her ways. 

I have never suffered a loss of a mom nor have I been engaged so it's hard for me to understand completely what she's going though as much as I want to. 

Thank you so much for your time and your help. 


tl;dr: how do I tell my best friend that I don't think it's a good idea for her to get married?
