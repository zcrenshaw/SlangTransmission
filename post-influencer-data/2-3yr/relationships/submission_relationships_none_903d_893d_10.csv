"[UPDATE] My ex-wife [36 F] still keeps trying to get back together with me [36 M] and our daughters [16 F] want that to happen too


[Link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4i903h/my_exwife_36_f_still_keeps_trying_to_get_back/)

It's been a while since I was first here and I was reminded recently that I owed an update to the kind and good people here who helped me with our troubles.

A lot of things has happened. Among those things, my daughters actually stumbled across my post. I had no idea they even browsed Reddit, let alone this place. When I came home one day from work I found them crying. They pretty much jumped me, hugged me, wouldn't let me go and begged me to forgive them. Sadly, they had read one of my replies and found out the dreadful extent of my ex-wife's affair and how much it had devastated me.

It took us a while, but we got through it, as a family. There was nothing for me to forgive, they're still young and they love their mother, who took that love and used it to manipulate them. That's on her, not them. There was some much needed counseling, but after several months, the woman who was helping us heal and move on has said that nothing more needed to be done, and they should only check in with her once in a while, rather than continue their weekly sessions. 

We're closer than we were before, but their relationship with their mother has suffered for it. Which I think is completely understandable, but I still cautioned them about lingering too much on what she did, since I had gotten over what she did all those years ago. That was something also resolved in counseling (both their own and our shared ones), so it's all behind us now. 

I had a brief confrontation with my ex-wife about it and made it clear that she was to not talk about this getting back together nonsense any more with our daughters. I can't tell if it really got through to her, but my daughters have not been pestered about me since then. Or they simply ignore their mother and don't bring it up at home. Either way, so long as my daughters are doing fine, I could care less about what my ex-wife is doing. 

Since the situation had improved, things had also become much better between my daughters and my girlfriend, so much that they actually started talking with her (rather than just exchange terse greetings and goodbyes), even occasionally asking for tips on something (girly stuff, of course), and I can't tell you how much it warmed my heart to see it happening for the first time. 

I'll admit that also helped me push my thoughts in the direction of proposing to my girlfriend, who had been incredibly supporting and understanding through all of this. We had known each other for a long time now, spent so much time as a couple, and after all this mess, I didn't really think there was anything more I could to to express my love for her. However, I was beaten to the punch. 

Two months ago, Clemence, together with my daughters, surprised me one day and proposed to me. I have to say that I felt very odd, but also very happy. Not just the proposal, but that my daughters had actually worked with my girlfriend on surprising me that day with dinner and a night out. To put it simply, I was blown away. It was a small and private ceremony, with only our closest friends and family attending. Currently, we're also expecting, and my daughters are looking forward to having a baby brother or sister to spoil.

  ---   
  **tl;dr: My daughters had found my previous post and saw in one of the replies how deeply I was hurt by their mother's cheating. Asked for forgiveness, there was no need for it. We worked through our issues together, both at home and in some counseling, and we healed from it and got much better. Even their relationship with my girlfriend had improved, so much that one day they helped her arrange a nice night for us, where she proposed to me. We're married and currently expecting, with my daughters eagerly looking forward to having a younger sibling to spoil rotten.**"
"I [14M] met my father for the first time yesterday. I'm really disappointed and I don't know if I want to met the rest of them anymore.


I just got home and I had a day to think it over, I dunno anymore. I really did not enjoy meeting my dad, Zack, and I am just not sure anymore. 

Zack is really immature for a 39 year old. He told me he likes to go to night clubs, bars, talk to young girls, etc, he's a frat boy that never grew up. He's just not what I was expecting. He told me that he could give me pointers on how to get 5 girls in 1 night. He comes off as such a douche. He's so in your face and loud. I don't know if I want  to meet the rest of the family. 

**TL;DR: I don't know if I want to meet the rest of the family.**"
"[UPDATE] Boyfriend [22/M] posted on reddit multiple times that he is falling for another girl and he wants to break up with me [21/F] but acts like the relationship between him and I is perfectly fine

"I [23F] am so sick of people in my social circle [20s M-F] implying that something is going on with me and my boyfriend's [25M] best friend [24M]


My boyfriend James and his best friend Carl are like brothers. They lived next door to each other as kids, went to the same university, and have been roommates since university. I've been with James for 2 years now, and we just moved in together in January. We found a place just down the street from their old apartment, and James jokes that the only reason we chose our current place is so he could stay close to his soulmate (Carl).

Carl and I didn't click immediately, but after James mentioned that he wished we were better friends, we tried to find something we had in common to bond over. We discovered that we have similar music tastes, so we started going to concerts together. When Carl invites James and I to an event and James doesn't want to go, he'll insist that Carl and I go have fun without him, which we do. Carl and I will never be super tight bffs, but I treasure his friendship and it's great that we finally have some common ground.

According to our friend group (and the posts I've lurked on /r/relationships), this is weird. James and I have received backhanded comments about how I shouldn't be spending so much time alone with another man, and how much fun Carl and I must have without James there. Once Carl and I went to the symphony (which James hates), and we had our photo taken by some nightlife company and had our picture posted on their Facebook page. We were standing several feet apart in the photo and clearly talking with other people, but a mutual friend screenshotted this and sent it to James with a very rude comment, and James immediately unfriended her.

These comments make me mad because 1) they imply that the only reason Carl and I hang out is to fuck behind James' back, not like we're actually friends with shared interests, and 2) there's the implication that I am not allowed to do anything without James there, and that doing otherwise is disrespecting my relationship. James usually laughs these comments off and dismisses them, while I just don't know what to say.

What I would like to know is how to handle these sorts of comments when they come up - I don't think Carl and I are doing anything wrong. James and I are always invited together, and he has stated many times he's happy that Carl and I have become good friends. What should I do?

tl;dr: I became good friends with his best friend, and we sometimes go to events with him (at his insistence). Friend group making unwelcome assumptions about my fidelity and rude comments."

"[Update] Me [24F] with my BF [24M] of 5 months. I need to break up with him but need advice.


[Original] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5wxvmj/me_24f_with_my_bf_24m_of_5_months_i_need_to_break/)

I just wanted to post a quick update to whoever commented/messaged me about my last post here. So I can happily say that I broke up with him that night. He knew something was up and I had a really hard time putting all the words out there but I told him we were done, and of course he tried to guilt me into staying with him. He kept going on about how much he put into our relationship and how he never treated me bad, but I stayed strong and told him we were no longer in a relationship. I even told him he could stay until he found another place. 

And then about 2 weeks later things got a little messy. He told me he found a place and was going to be out by that Saturday. Then I came home that Friday and was upstairs in my room. He came into my room and started asking me random questions about my ex - what's his name, is his name so and so. I told him it was none of his business, and then realize that while I changed my passwords and locks on my iPhone/laptop, I never changed my password on my iPad.. He went through my Facebook on my iPad while I was at work (even though we had been broken up for 2 weeks at that point) and saw messages from another guy that I was talking to.  I never even gave him the code to my iPad and had no idea he knew the code (it was different than all my other ones and I rarely use it). 

He goes and grabs my iPad and tries to show me and asks who is so and so? And I take my iPad from him and told him it was none of his business, we were broken up. I wasn't even talking to my ex, I confided in an old FWB and we started flirting pretty hardcore, but I hadn't even done anything physical with him at that point. He just assumed it was my ex for whatever reason. Then he starts telling me I'm a ho and a slut, and I started to feel suffocated because I've been in shitty abusive relationships before. So then I packed all of my electronics and left. 

About 5 minutes later I realized that he just berated me and called me abusive names in my own house, and I got realllllly pissed. I went back home and told him to get the fuck out, I was being nice by letting him stay until he could find a place and then he has to go snooping through all my things. He kept begging and asking if he could stay, that I'm not a ho, that I'm really smart and that he knows guys want me etc. Basically all B.S. like before so he could stay longer. I stayed firm and told him I didn't care, he doesn't get to call me names in my own house, and he needs to pack his stuff and leave NOW. He packed and left a few hours later. I don't know and don't care where he went, but I am so happy he is no longer in my life. I blocked his number and blocked him on all social media.

I've started eating better again and have been going to the gym 5x a week for the past few weeks, and am feeling sooo much better. I've lost about 5 pounds since he's been gone. I was really in quite a slump there for a while and put on quite a bit of weight, so I'm taking care of myself for now.

Thank you everyone that bothered to read/reply to my first point, you guys helped me make the right choice and gave me the push I need, I love you all.

She listed other reasons for ending it, but I really knew it was because of this guy.  I was really upset, going through a nightmare divorce, but dealt with it and moved on.  I decided she wasn't that good of a friend anyway to desert me when I needed friends the most.

He and I stopped seeing each other at that time, but started up again last Fall and have been having a great time together ever since.  

My old BFF reached out recently, and I reciprocated.  We started with a playdate, which went really well, and we decided to go out to dinner just the two of us.  I told the guy (I don't consider him a BF) who is still good friends with her and her husband that he needs to tell her about us before I go to this dinner.  Well, she is livid again.  She can't use any of the reasons she used last year to end our friendship, so now I know it is simply because of him, and I am baffled.  This is her husband's best friend, she has been married for 12 years, I can't understand the jealousy and need to be territorial.  

Can anyone shed some light on this for me??

"My [25/M] husband is trying to shame me [25/F] for getting a job because he's insecure


He's extremely insecure and always thinks I am going to leave him for ""something better."" 


I've been completely content and happy in marriage but when he acts like this I do wonder why I am putting up with this behavior. 


Basically, I got a job today. He even gave me tips today when I asked him how I should better prepare myself for interview questions.


Today was a follow up (2nd) interview. After I left, they called about an hour later to offer me a position. When I told my husband I got the job, he said he ""found it suspicious they gave me a job the same day.""


I asked him if he was joking. He continued to further this toxic conversation by saying that he's ""going to have to keep closer tabs on me."" and that he *doesn't want to have to worry about what I'm doing when I'm at ""work.""*


He ended by telling me that I'm ""too much BS and not enough good.""


**Verbatim:** ""You want to be this hip, cool, independent girl. Why be married? or why be in your kid's life? Why do you have to work when I have a great career. You don't always have to be doing something. Just be happy and raise our kid.""



At this point I told him that he's not a supportive spouse whatsoever and that he is acting like a sociopath and that we need to get counseling. 


I don't know what else to do. He is not fazed by me not talking to him when he gets home. He just harasses me via text or will accuse me of something if I don't respond to his obvious trap messages. I asked him why he would say a ridiculous thing about our son solely because I got a job. He doesn't answer to logic. 


I'm at my wits end. I'm a loyal wife. I'm not interested in other people. I'm committed to the fullest extent but it still isn't good enough for someone with such obvious crippling anxiety and insecurities.

"Friend [24F] wants us [22-25Fs] to call her ""mom.""


There's a girl in our friend group who's pretty fun and quirky but lately she's been going around asking us all to call her mom, or that saying she's ""the mom friend."" Some people have gotten into it because she is a very nice and caring person, but it's also really awkward sometimes. Especially when she does it in front of strangers or in public.

I don't mind if I'm allowed to ignore it and just call her by her name but the constant insistence has become uncomfortable. When I explained to her that I can't/won't do it because I don't see her that way and I'm just not into it, she became very upset and not only implied I was jealous but also that people really do see her like a mom. The latter would be fine if it weren't for the way she explained it, which came across as very pretentious.

She's a likable person, but lately with this thing it's become a major divide in our friend group of around seven to ten people. The handful of us who aren't down are being left out and it's become more difficult to partake in plans because ""mom"" is ""taking the kids out to play."" There are some other behaviors pertaining to her mental health that have made addressing things even more difficult.

I guess I'm fine with just opting out of the group entirely, I have other friends, but I'm not sure how to deal with it? What is with this and is there a way to explain that I'm not interested in calling her ""mom"" or letting her treat me like a child without angering her or alienating my friends who do enjoy it?

UPDATE: I was invited to hang out with the group tonight but politely declined after checking the aforementioned friend's social media. She even has things like ""Mom friend"" plastered all over her profiles which is a little too weird for me right now considering. Going to cuddle up with my boyfriend and watch Archer instead and think a little more on how I want to handle this going forward. Thank you so much for the support! I really appreciate the suggestions and am always happy to hear more!

"Father (63M) brought a complete stranger to meet me (26F) in recovery room post surgery


  I had major orthopedic surgery (planned) 4 days ago. My parents are divorced and we had already planned on my mother bringing me home post op, but my father expressed wanting to see me when I came out of the OR. He spoke to me the day before and also to my mother the day of surgery, to clarify timing etc, and never mentioned to either one of us he would have anyone with him. 
   
  I suspected he had been seeing someone new as he had been calling me that week from a different number, and when I asked where he was, he told me ""a friend's"". He doesn't tend to discuss his relationships with me or be forthcoming about this sort of thing. 
  
  I woke up from the anesthesia and had only been awake 5-10 minutes when the nurse asked for my father's name to go get him. In he strolled with a lady I have never seen before. I was very groggy, in pain, nauseous, and shaky when he introduced me to this lady. I don't even remember what her name was. 
  
  She was perfectly nice, but I feel he crossed a major line. I feel this was completely unacceptable, especially where I had no notice. He doesn't understand why I'm mad. Am I overreacting in being furious with him?

"Boyfriend [22/M] posted on reddit multiple times that he is falling for another girl and he wants to break up with me [21/F] but acts like the relationship between him and I is perfectly fine


Hello! I wanted to preface this by saying thank you for taking the time to read about a stranger over the internet and her relationship problems. 

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My boyfriend and I had a rough start. We started off as friends with benefits but eventually became a committed couple. I had ridiculously abusive parents and I was also very poor. This meant I relied on him a lot for rides and money. However, I would seldom ask for the amount of generosity he would give me but he insisted that he did it because he loved me and didn't expect much in return. We've known each other for 3 years, been together for 2, and in the last 8 months I was able to move out of my parents' house, get a job, and a car. Things we were both waiting so long for. The past couple years have been hard on me but he was always my rock. However, now that life is looking up for me, I find that he is no longer as caring as he once was. 

About a month ago he posted on reddit saying how he wanted to break up with me because he felt suffocated and how with my newfound independence he realized how much he gave up for me. I felt extremely hurt because for the majority of our relationship I have always encouraged him to not prioritize me the way he did and whenever I would attempt to hang out with friends of my own he would always get insecure to the point where I would stop hanging out with them even though he never said I should. I was honestly so peeved about how he'd whine about how insecure he was that I stopped seeing most of my friends altogether. 

In his posts he also mentions how he feels guilty about wanting to break up with me since I am in love with him but he feels much better on his own or with his friends. 

The day after this post he immediately comes to my place after his class and is in tears, he's graduating from university this May and is under a lot of stress but what he's saying isn't lining up with what his reddit posts says. He mentions that he does love me and that he does want to be with me. He mentions that I wasn't a burden to him and he did all that he did because he wanted to and not out of obligation. He doesn't know that I know his reddit handle and I know this is a breach of privacy but he wouldn't communicate to me. This all dropped out of the clear blue sky. 

When he first told me about his anxiety about graduation I hadn't read his post yet and I was surprisingly well-composed and suggested we break up and I wouldn't take it personally. If he feels he can't juggle work and school on top of graduation then I don't want to impede on his success. However the more we talked the more upset I became because he keeps saying that he loves me and wants to be with me. We agree to go on a break which I took pretty well initially until I read the post. Our guidelines for the break were to still keep in contact but at our own pace, he initially tells me that if I start falling for another guy and I feel like it's serious enough then I should go for it. Which was a huge red flag that I should have noticed sooner. During the times where he was the clingy one and I demanded a break, I never received one especially if I brought up the possibility of seeing other people. We managed to work out our prior grievances but I can't help but feel cheated. During the break he has spent a large amount of time with his friends which was to be expected, but I did feel neglected considering he would only make the effort to see me if his prior plans were cancelled and our dates were no where near as grandiose as the hang out with his friends. 


Our spring break was last week and we went on a fairly nice date on March 19th where he held my hand, he said I love you, he seemed happy. However, through this month he has been changing. He has always been prim and proper and I was the only who would be outlandish and the dynamic work. However, I find that lately he has been extremely casual and he honestly is a complete 180 of the guy I first started dating. 

I was happy in a way because the traditional side of him was a bit of a bother but this new.. ""cool/cocky"" attitude is a bit overdone. 

A few days after I asked him if we could talk about the break and he just goes, ""Oh yeah! Things went back to normal so I totally forgot we were even on a break"" which was dumb and also highly unlike him. 

I didn't feel relieved now that the ""break"" was officially over. Things seemed to go back to normal as he said but they still felt.. off. 

I checked his reddit, which he did tell me his username ages ago but I think he forgot, and he posted saying how he's falling for a classmate, hard. and he mentions that he went out to bars, museums, and concerts 5 times over the break. I felt so fucking blindsided. During break he would always ask me what I'm doing and who I was hanging out with but never told me this. 

What bothered me even more was that the post was in regards to if he has a chance with her. He didn't even mention that he's still in a relationship AT ALL. The advice given to himis that he should pursue this girl and he seems like he will. 

I planned a date this Friday but I told him I want to cancel it and have a talk instead. 

I don't know how to feel. I felt like him blindsiding me was also my fault because earlier that week we watched an episode of a show that consists of drama, murder, and a gratuitous amount of affairs. I told him that if I were ever cheated on I would rather not know and I feel like physical cheating is more vile than emotional. Upon reading his post I wanted to take it all back. Both forms of cheating are obviously vile and I do want to know why he did this. 

I guess my question is, what do you think of this situation and how should I approach this on Friday?

tl;dr: Boyfriend made posts saying he wants to break up and is falling for a girl hard but is telling me that everything is okay and that he loves me and wants to be with me. How do I approach him about this?

"My aunt [50sF] belittled me [22F] after my brother [30M] physically assaulted me. How do I make my family stop pressuring me to forgive her?


In April 2014 my (half) brother physically assaulted me in our home during an argument. After the first time he hit me I messaged my dad and told him that ""Chris"" had hit me, he was angry and to call the police because he had threatened to kill me. After I messaged Chris tried to come back into my room and I slammed the door in his face. He pushed back in and attacked me further, which resulted in bruises on my neck where he tried to choke me, and a cut above my ear which was bleeding. He is physically bigger and stronger than me. My mum witnessed the second part of the attack and, as a shit parent would do, took my brothers side in everything. 

When the police arrived to take a statement, they took photos of my injuries, asked if I wanted to press charges (which I decided not to) my mum refused to make a statement of her own and just said ""what she said happened"" when they asked her. They didn't arrest him because he'd already left. Not long after we received letters saying Chris had a court ordered avo, and that if anything further happened he would be arrested. 

A few days after that I received a message from my aunt, letting me know that ""family are meant to stick together"" and ""now your brother is going to court because of you"" and how I need to ""act before thinking"" I replied with ""sorry, I won't tell anyone the next time I'm abused and someone threatens to kill me, silly me for thinking I should be safe"" it turned into me defending myself, and her telling me I shouldn't have gotten an avo because it would ""limit his future opportunities"" I had to remind her that it was a court ordered avo that was done by the police because of my injuries. She said a lot of extremely rude and hurtful things, all while I tried to defend myself.

She proceeded to block me on Facebook, I gave up any contact with her. About a year later she unblocked me, and sent me a message saying ""I apologise for calling you a shitty person"" I didn't reply. About two weeks after she sent another message  ""and I apologise for being a shitty aunty""

Now my mum and nana are both pressuring me to talk to her again, and to forgive her. I don't want to. She never apologised for the things she said to me, for telling me I deserved to be abused, for telling me having the police called was an immature decision. I accepted the loss of someone who clearly didn't care about me, she doesn't bring any value to my life, I still speak to my uncle and cousins, so it's not like I'm cutting off any extra family by not speaking to her. 


tl;dr - my aunt told me I deserved it, among other horrible things, after I was assaulted. I cut off contact with her. My mum and nana are now pressuring me to talk to her because ""it's been long enough"" how do I get them to stop?

Edit - man I wish I'd used my throwaway for this. I can't thank you guys enough for everything you're saying. I feel like I'm going slightly less crazy knowing that I'm not a horrible person for not wanting to speak to her"

Is it appropriate to get in touch with her to be friends and support each other. I feel a sense of kinship with her and our kids are siblings.


Question is pretty much in the Title, but a little more relevant background is in order. My ex is a pretty rotten person, he went after me when I was 21 and he was 38. I thought I was too smart to listen to all my family and friends warnings (to girls in their teens and 20s being wooed by an older guy...LISTEN TO YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS). 12 years later I I've let my career go to waste, I was totally dependent on him, thank god for generous court system because he would have left me and my kids with zero if it were his choice. At least now I have some breathing room.

About 18 months ago I found out about his other child. I was 70% sure something was up but was validated after a long sting of events that caught him red handed at work having the affair. 

Fast forward to this weekend and I saw the girl and baby at a hotel. It was like looking into a mirror 10 years ago. I felt awful for her. I've heard through the grapevine that he's more or less abandoned her too and she's fighting for support now. 

Is it appropriate to reach out to her and try to be friendly and support her in whatever way I can? I feel a kinship with her and as of yet, my kids have not met thier sibling. Is this too odd basically?

  **tl;dr**: I want to contact the woman who had my ex husbands baby because he has abandoned her now too. I think my reasoning is ok because we actually have a lot in common and our kids are siblings who've never met. I just want a sanity check before I go ahead and do it."

"I (31F) told my husband (29M) that if he lies to me anymore I can't stay in the relationship. He lied to me again tonight.


Throwaway account for reasons. 

TL;DR: I told him that the next time he lies to me, I'm done. I can't stay in a relationship with someone I don't trust. He just lied to me again, and I'm desperate for options. I love him and I don't want to leave but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. 

The background: 

We started dating in 2009, got married in 2015. He'd lied to me about minor things a couple times while we were dating, which I wasn't comfortable with, but we went to therapy for it, and it didn't seem like a big problem. (Yeah, I know how that sounds.)

After we get married, I find out he's been lying to me about drinking for like a whole year. It's bad. Before I realized it was booze, I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me what was going on. He didn't. It got to the point where I didn't trust myself anymore, because I was seeing that something was fishy and he kept denying it. He only caved and told me about the drinking when I finally said I wasn't talking to him anymore unless he told me what was up. 

This started a (really expensive) round of therapy, both couples and individual for both of us, and a psychiatry referral for him. Therapists and psychiatrist agree that there seem to be issues with alcohol, but that he doesn't actually seem to be alcoholic. He tried taking disulfram for a while to prove to me he's not drinking. That worked for a while, but eventually I realized that I still didn't trust him. Recently we decided that it ultimately has to be his responsibility to drink (or not drink) responsibly, so he's been drinking a bit, usually with me. I had stated, though, in no unclear terms that I cannot be in a relationship with someone who lies to me, and that the next time it happened would be the last. I feel that we've gone through so much therapy over the years that if that hasn't made a difference, I don't know what will. 

So anyway. Tonight I went to bed before him and I'm woken up when he trips on something and hits his head on the wall. There's bleeding, but what worries me is that he seems out of it and he's slurring his speech. I ask him if he's drink a couple of times, he says no. I say that we should go to urgent care if he's hit his head so hard that he's slurring, and finally he eventually admits that he'd been drinking. 

Sooooooo yeah. He's lied to me twice about drinking tonight, and it's pretty clear that that's crossed my line in the sand. I don't want to go. I love him. Even our therapists have said that in a lot of ways we're a model couple... except apparently when he's being a lying shithead.

I'm also daunted at the process of starting my life over when we divorce. I work part-time at a non-profit for a low wage with no benefits, so I guess it's time to start job hunting, too. 

If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them. I can't let myself get lied to over and over, but maybe one of you has a magical solution that I haven't seen yet. 

Thanks. 

**Edit:** I brought up the ""model couple"" thing because I want to convey that there are seriously good points about the relationship too. If it weren't good in a lot of major ways I'd be gone already. To me it's worth saving, *if* it's possible to save. I'm not trying to use that to justify staying per se; regardless of how good I think it is, I do know I can't stay in a relationship with someone who won't stop lying to me.

**Edit 2:** He started lying to me about drinking before I made any suggestion that he might not be drinking responsibly. I'm not against drinking in general. I drink. I like drinking. I like drinking with my husband, when things don't go tits up.

**Update:** Thanks for the support and comments, everyone. At my request, he's not staying at home now - staying a a hotel or somewhere for at least a while. I haven't made the plunge yet and told him we're done, but he knows it's still on the table. I might just not have it in me to do it all at once, so I'm considering this the first step.

One small glimmer of hope is what everyone's said about alcoholism. We haven't gone through treating that, and it seems like maybe there's a glimmer of home that treatment could help. Even if I'm fooling myself, at least he's not under my roof anymore. I've told him that if there's even a chance of this working out that he has to stop drinking and start to get help.

**Update 2:** I've realized I've worded it wrong. I should not have said, ""if you lie to me again I'm leaving,"" because that is an ultimatum and it shouldn't have been. It should have been a statement of fact, to express what I needed in the relationship. What I should have said was, ""I cannot stay in a relationship with someone who lies to me."" If it's a problem with alcohol that's causing him to lie to me, and he's seriously working to address that, I'm willing to give it another go. It's still scary, though.

**Edit 3:** I went to my first Al-Anon meeting yesterday. I'm not sure the program is right for me, but I'll try more before deciding."
"Me [24 F] with my Coworker [34 F]; she buys the same clothes as me, and considers me a ""sister."" She's clingy and it's creeping me out.


Small update: Thanks everyone the awesome advice! Lots of things I'm starting to implement. I agree with a lot of the comments. I don't communicate clearly enough with Emma about how her behavior makes me feel. The main reason is that I do feel bad for her. She's somewhat ostracized from our department. I want to be kind, since like I said she's perfectly sweet. She's just overbearing, clingy, and doesn't know appropriate professional boundaries. She's always reminded me of a fourteen year old girl in terms of her insecurities and sensitive nature. I was truly shocked when I first found out she was in her 30s. I couldn't believe it, and I found it easier to understand if I thought of her as a teenager. Getting her feelings hurt over small bouts of silences? Constantly thinking people are ""mad"" at her? Wondering always if people ""like her"" or are ""talking about her""? Much easier to understand if she's a teen girl in my brain. 

Thinking of her as a grown woman who is responsible for her own feelings is something I need to start doing. That alone will make me less accepting of a lot of her behavior. 

I've been creating more distance by barely responding to her work IMs, and rejecting any requests to go shopping or hang out. I'm doing it all politely, ""Sorry, really busy,"" and ""I have plans, thanks though!"" Still not as direct as I should be, but I am creating more of a distance and it feels good.

I also, thank God, applied for three new positions at my workplace! I have a good shot at them so hopefully I'll only have another month or two of Emma. 

My current job has other annoying qualities. Emma's not the only factor in this decision, but man it will be good to get some space! 

Hopefully, after some more distance and boundary setting, we can have a healthy, (grab lunch once a month) kind of work-friendship in the future. 

Thanks again everyone! 

Original Post:

  Back story: Emma (34) is an incredibly sweet, albeit not a very bright or mature woman. We've worked together for about one and a half years. Emma gives off a very ""teen girl"" vibe. She's sensitive and emotional, needs to be included in inside jokes or conversation, thinks people are mad at her if they aren't engaging with her. Just a desperate ""please be my friend!"" and ""please like me!"" vibe.  It turned one of my coworkers off to the point where he barely responds when she talks to him. It's rude, definitely, but part of me gets it. She's a lot to handle and lately I've been struggling more with being around her. 

When I first got the job as part of Emma's team two years ago, after just a few days she called me her ""work sister."" I laughed and said I already had two sisters and we didn't always get a long, but that was sweet of her to say. I thought that would end it, but she still occasionally tells me ""You're like a sister to me!"" I respond with small smile, or say ""That's nice!"" or ""Aww that's sweet."" However it grates on me and I don't want to encourage that level of clinginess.  

We are friends; we work right next to each other on a very small team and sit right next to each other. She does sweet things like buy the office treats, decorates people's cubicles for birthday's, etc. We do laugh and have fun at work but lately this work friendship has gotten too intense and one-sided. Some examples: 

- There is a shopping area near our work. Emma and I often shop during lunch breaks. We went a few times together, but every time I'd find a shirt or jacket and show her she'd want the same thing...and nearly always ended up buying it. I gave her a bit of attitude saying, ""Well hopefully we don't show up wearing the same thing now.""  She responded, ""Why not? It's cute I would be twinsies with my friends in middle school!""

OK, that creeped me out and I decided the easy solution is no more shopping with Emma. 

I'd shop by myself, and when I came back to the office with shopping bags she'd ask to see what I'd bought. Well, I thought it was harmless to show her, but when she asked where I got a particular top, she ran out and went to go look for it at the store so she could have it too.

One recent lunch break, she texted me from the store, ""Omg, I found that jacket you have! I want to get it!"" 

I told her she could buy whatever she wanted, but I'd prefer she didn't since she had JUST bought a few new jackets, and we have a lot of the same clothes. She texted back sad faces but didn't get the jacket. Relieved, I thought I was clear and Emma would understand you can admire someone's clothes without owning them.

But no. Last week I showed up wearing a new shirt. It was fairly distinctive and Emma admired it ""Omg cute shirt!"" not thinking I said, ""Thanks I got it on sale last week at X Store."" 

That same day she goes out to shop at lunch, comes back and said, ""I went to X Store but they didn't have your shirt! I really want it!"" 

I was visibly annoyed and said, ""Well that's probably good we have a lot of the same stuff already.""

Then yesterday she lets me know, ""I went back to X Store and they still didn't have it, but they special ordered it online for me!"" I didn't really know what to say and was kind of in shock; still am a bit. Am I overreacting? It is a pet peeve of mine to show up to the office dressed in the same top; there are endless ""Omg look at you two twins!"" comments, which she enjoys but drive me nuts. 

- Another example of clinginess: our work has an instant messaging System, and our department IMs often with each other about work stuff but mostly just to joke around or chat. Emma chats me almost all day, and I chat back but at about half the rate (my one message for every three or four of Emma's). If I don't respond for awhile, I'll get the ""Are you mad at me?"" bit. 

If someone else chats me and she sees their chat window on my screen, she gets jealous, ""Oh, so and so is chatting with you I see. They never chat with me. :( Are you guys talking about me?""

I've straight up told her she's being nosy and paranoid, but she'll get mopey and can't help glancing at my screen. 

Reddit, please help! She's a sweet girl with a big heart, but her clinginess and ""twinning"" is driving me up the wall. I'm not planning on changing jobs, so how can I deal with her behavior?

"I [29f] am not comfortable with my boyfriend's [28m] new lifestyle. Dating 5 yrs. Help!


Like the title says, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. Let's call him Sean. I will also have to apologize for the writing style, more a stream of consciousness.

Sean and I met when we were in college. I am now working in a professional environment with a M-F 9-5 type schedule. He has not yet found a job in his chosen field and has been working at a bar for the last 6 months. He normally works either a late shift 6pm-12am or from 9pm-3am.

We live in an area (and sorry to be vague, boyfriend is also on Reddit) where the bars do not have a mandated closing time. I'm not opposed to going out with friends and having a good time but my schedule does not normally allow me to be out all night. 

We've had a couple of instances where he was still out when I got up in the morning, and was still out when I left for work! I've picked him up from bars where he could barely walk and have made sure that he gets home safe. He's told me that he's done cocaine to deal with the late schedule.

Well, recently, he told me he was going out with a few of his coworker's after work. I found out later that these coworker's were two women I've met in passing but don't know well. One of these ladies we'll call Sarah. I get a weird vibe from Sarah and think she's a little too friendly with Sean. I don't think he cheated but it feels like he omitted which coworker's he was out with purposefully. That same night he didn't come home and I picked him up from a bar at noon the next day.

I laid it out there that I was in no way comfortable with the way he acted. I explained that because we're no longer in our early 20s and have been dating for a while that I really want a more domestic lifestyle and someone who wants to start building a future together. He apologized and promised that he would try harder to take my feelings into account and assured me that we still have the same goals.

Well, I met him last night to go out together when he got off work. I waited for an hour and a half because his coworker's couldn't get their stuff together enough to help with tips and even though I was there waiting, he felt as though he needed to stay and help (please note that there were 3 or 4 other coworker's just talking to each other who he could have asked to help). I was upset that I had to wait. Not the end of the world but it was already almost midnight when he got off work and by that time I just wanted to go home.

When he finally finishes, he tells me that Sarah is going to come with us to the show we wanted to go to. She comes with and mentions that Sean told her that I was upset about waiting and that it wasn't his fault.

Well, now I feel like not only was it disrespectful to let her join us, Sean shouldn't have told her that I was upset. 

I need advice. How do I salvage this relationship? Are my feelings understandable or am I being too sensitive? And how can I tell him to kick Sarah to the side without being a jerk?

TL;DR
I'm upset that my boyfriend and I have different lifestyles and am not comfortable with his actions or his friendship with a new female coworker.

"Am I [32F] being taken too much for granted by my husband [38M] in our marriage? Doubting my self worth and esteem now.


Been with my husband for 10 years, of which married for 7. He's always been the star in the relationship, the life of our social circle, with a power career, an amazing son and all that. As more and more time passes, I feel like I am a supporting role in our life. 

Nothing outrightly cruel or mean, just a general sense of his decisions defining our lives and I am a people pleaser by nature. But now I feel the resentment building up. Have tried to talk to him a couple of times about how I feel, but he thinks I am being over dramatic. 

But something happened yesterday that makes me rethink everything. He got a local radio station that he works for to play a prank on me for April Fools, which was very humiliating (edit : have removed the details to make it less identifiable). 

 He tells me that's what a marriage is about - unconditional love and support, but I can't help but think if I am too much of a wimp in this relationship. What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this? 
TLDR ; Aprils fool prank by husband makes wife question how much of a wimp she is in the relationship, husband sees no issue with the whole situation. How much unconditional love and support is normal, and when does it become being taken granted for?

Edit : updated to clarify a couple of details.

Edit : Removed all the details of the prank to make this post unidentifiable. 

Edit : Thanks for all your support guys. And hugs back to those who gave me hugs. I really appreciate all you guys taking time out to reply to me. I told him the prank simply cannot air anymore. He promised he will take it off air by today, though I suspect that it would have ended normally since April Fools is over. But more importantly, I found the answer to my question - Am I a wimp in this relationship - yes. I need to sit with myself, sort out my feelings, understand what do I need for myself. I will explore therapy - Need to work on my passiveness, and also figure out if I want this marriage to work, and if yes, how to make it work. 
Once again, thank you everybody for your thoughts, they give me renewed belief in myself, and the confidence to actually do something about it.

Update : Day 2 after the prank aired. I am still trying to tell him just how bad I felt and why. He apologized a couple of times, and then snapped at me and told me, ""enough, we've fought about it yesterday. Just end it now and forget it. I don't want to talk about it anymore. "" I am realizing just how little my feelings matter. How was I so blind all this while!!"
"Me [38 M] with my wife [40 F] of 8 years. I think have fell out of love with her.


Hey Reddit, I have been lurking for a while, this is my first post here, I don't even know where to start as my feelings are still raw, i'm just looking for a outlet, somewhere I can write how I feel. Its a shame its about something miserable like this. I apologize now, this is going to be more like a book than a post. 

The reason for this post is I don't think I love my wife anymore. I'll refer to her as 'A' as I have no intention of her reading this is shes on here. 


Bit of background: We got married the summer of 2008, so we are married 8 coming up 9 years. Had been together a few years before. It was a great couple of years before and after the marriage. The usual family troubles on both sides and similar but that's been sorted one way or another. We have a little boy together and she had a older son from a previous partner who's married and left the nest. Both of them are awesome kids. I am self employed' have been since way before I met her. She has had numerous jobs in the past but not so much the last year where it worked out better for both of us that she helped me with my work. Luckily we have no money issues, we are not rich but we get by with a bit extra for a odd treat here and there. 


Fast forward to 3 maybe 4 years ago, things had been slowly going off the boil with us. I was working more, she was looking after the house and did a part time job. I assumed this was what being a 'normal' married couple was like.  We still spoke, we went out for weekly date night and generally got on great still but slowly we had got a lot less intimate.


Then out the blue A was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She went in for the operation a month after the results came back. They had given her a hysterectomy. She started the long road to recovery. Thankfully she's a trooper, she has a real positive attitude and just took it in her stride. I was dead proud of her. 

Its terrible of me to say and feel this but this was the beginning of us falling apart, let me explain a bit more.

I though we still got on great. We didn't have sex though, this was took straight off the table and for good reason I thought. A few months after her op we tried and it hurt her, plus she said having the hysterectomy and her other bits out she couldn't get any pleasure from sex anymore and the body wasn't making any hormones so she didn't ever feel like wanting to be intimate. She explained it as the equivalent of being castrated. 



A while later we are sat in our lads school on a school disco, I was sat behind her at the table and spotted her deleting messages. I trusted her, thought nothing of it. In bed that night her phone started vibrating while she was in the bathroom, we never had locks or anything on phones, and often put each others on charge behind the bed. as I turned the phone over the screen lit up and the message on the screen read 'fuck tomorrow'. 


I felt sick, I was working away the next 2 days and was in no mood to confront her at that point about it. I went to work for the next 2 days, my brother was working with me on the installation and I had to tell him as he knew something was up. I came back and asked her for her phone and if she had anything to tell me. She handed me her phone and wanted to know what was going on, I told her what I saw that night and wanted to be alone for a while to think. There was some flirty texts, one of which her offering to give him a blowjob but nothing to say she went through with it. She had deleted everything received, and I can only assume sent.

She explained this all away as it was this other guy just being dirty and she had some text fun, I had words with the guy who had been messaging who also had a girlfriend and he was adamant nothing happened it was just him being stupid. I took a few days thinking about what to do, in my head I wanted to leave and had all but mentally checked out but i'm ashamed to say I stayed as I didn't want to miss my little boy growing up. Her excuse for not being able to tell me was she couldn't remember what had been sent by either of them. 
I suppose to all intents and purposes I tried to forgive her as I didn't have enough proof to act on anything. 
It was the first time I knew she had done anything like this and I was stuck in limbo. I wanted to leave but didn't at the same time. In a selfish way what the fuck was she being all sexy and flirty with another guy for when shes left me out to dry for the last 12 months. That's the bit that hurt the most, it came across as something was wrong with me, what the fuck did she see in this bloke that was better than me all of a sudden.



So that's where I am up to 6 months ago. I spent the last year or two playing husband going through the motions, still doing date nights, still doing holidays and family stuff. From the outside everything probably looks normal, we still get on fine but more like room mates or good friends than a couple.  No one knew about the past apart from my brother. I've tried to forget/forgive/move on but there's this nagging feeling that won't go away and I cant let go. I've never really had a good explanation of what happened, what messages were sent and why. There's no closure in it for me but its been so long now I don't think bringing it up again would actually be of any use to either of us. 

Since a few months before Christmas we started arguing over stupid things I have said during a conversation with her. I normally haven't got a clue what I've said wrong or how it could be misinterpreted but she does. She picks up on a point to argue about and keeps saying don't you remember saying this, well no I don't remember, its not that I forgot I just don't see why I would have said that. Sometimes though to be fair I can see how she can pick at it to make it point but normally I just give up and agree its my fault as I don't think its worth arguing about. 


I'd agreed to disagree before for a easy life but last night was the final straw. She went to a hospital appointment on her own as I was still 150 miles away driving home. She phoned to say how it went then out the blue she said why are you laughing, its not a laughing matter. I honestly was not laughing, I don't know how she thought I was laughing, I said the word 'right' but i'm wrong again. She hung up and I got home about 3 hours later. I went into the bedroom to see her, tried my best but just done another 18 hour day and wasn't in the mood for the bullshit, it ended in a argument and I slept on the sofa.

This morning she carried it on. I didn't raise my voice but wouldn't let her get away with her interpretation of the events which surprised the hell out of me as it was completely different to what actually happened. She forgot about the bit when I came in from work and said hello, lay on the bed next to her, us bickering as she had some shitty condescending attitude on her and then me getting up leaving the room, coming back in and it blowing up. 
In her head I came home from work, shouted at her from the bedroom door and that was it.
She looked scared and angry, told me I'm mental and now scaring her and need to go see a doctor and then left the house to god knows where. She had completely forgot about the first bit of of our disagreement and looked scared that she couldn't remember, then decided I was just making it up and told me as such. I'm stood there in my boxers in the hall watching her walk out the door wondering did that really happen. 


I have no idea what is going on in her head, but I can tell you this and it saddens me to say it but I didn't feel sorry for her at all. In fact I felt nothing, not a ounce of anything, it's like there's nothing left in my heart to give. I don't want to try and help her any more, I've removed myself to the spare bedroom where I've been typing this for the last god knows how many hours and have no idea how I'm going to feel or what to do next when the morning comes around.


Sorry for the essay, it feels so much better out here in the open than going around in circles in my head.

"My girlfriend [21F] wants to open a joint investment bank account with me [24 M] I said no, and now she thinks I'm not committed


My girlfriend and I have lately been looking into financial investments and now she wants to create a joint investment bank account with me. I don't see the point of doing it and Ive heard so many people advise against doing it with someone you are not married to. She said that her idea is that we basically put in 1000$ each to start and then just contribute 20$ a month to it each and don't touch it and let it grow. 


After looking at all the facts and seeing how there is actually no financial benefit to joining these accounts, I suggested that we just do it on our own and if it comes to the point that were engaged we can just pool our money together. However, she took that as me not being committed because I told her that it can get messy if we ever end our relationship and we have an account together. But I am very committed, I definitely do see a future with her (we've been dating a little over two years). She also said that I was limiting her potential and if I wasn't going to do an account with her then she'll do one with someone else, which i found kind of harsh. I know she's not the type to try and take all my money either.


Basically her idea is that if we do it together then we have more power because were doing it as one. I have trouble even understanding what that even means. What do you guys think about creating a joint account in my situation?

  **tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

My girlfriend wants to create a joint bank account with me but i don't think it is such a good idea since there is no financial benefit to it. She see's it as me not being committed in our relationship and she thinks we have more power doing it together which makes no sense to me. "

"[22/F] I regret moving in with my boyfriend [23/M] and now I feel depressed and I feel trapped.


""Ray"" and I will be together for 7 months next Saturday. We live together and always have. These days, I'm faced with nothing but remorse, regret and depression because I regret my decision.

 It was my apartment first. He came over one night after sushi, he spent the night and never left and slowly over time moved his stuff in and then it became our apartment. The people he lived with before me divorced and she owned the house so he had to move out anyway, and I was having a hard time affording things on my own, and we got along so well so it seemed like a good idea at the time..

 Now I find myself becoming increasingly annoyed over time to the point that I don't even wanna be home anymore.

First: I feel as though he took over the place. He moved in all this stuff and it all HAD to be out in the open, and as a result I had to rearrange and remove a large portion of my stuff. A bunch of my things are now in boxes in the storage unit in the basement. His PS4 is now in the livingroom, he sent my 360 into the bedroom because he likes watching Netflix before bed. Now the livingroom is ""his space' where he sits on my futon and plays his PS4 on my TV with his mic on talking and yelling at his friends. I'm unable to speak or do much in my own livingroom because he always has his headset on, his friends can hear me and everything I say and do, and I'm always met with disapproving glances whenever I speak or do anything loud.

Second: My bedroom. I can't rearrange the furniture or do anything to my bedroom. I want to move things around because my furniture has been in the same spot since I moved here almost a year ago. But he says ""No he doesn't want the bed there."" ""No we can't have the dresser there because XYZ"" ""He likes it this way."" and so its stuck the way it is. Its frustrating because I just want to move my things to where I want them but I can't because now this is a shared space and all our decisions have to be mutual decisions.

Third: When we go grocery shopping I'm unable to buy what I want. We have to split things 50/50 which means what we buy is a mutual decision. I can't throw a 2.99$ frozen pizza in the cart because he hates frozen pizza. He hates green beans so we can't buy those. I hate it so much that now when we go grocery shopping I don't even speak or put things in the cart I just let him go and pick what we buy.

Fourth: I have no ""me"" time. Sure I can go into the bedroom but hes still in the next room and I can still hear him yelling at the TV. If I'm on the phone with my mom he can hear me in the next room, I have no privacy because if I'm texting or FBing someone he can see everything I'm doing. I don't even have anything that's ""mine' anymore. Its all ""ours"". Even though ALL the furniture in this apartment is MINE and the majority of the stuff is MINE, he now dubs it ""ours."" Our bed, our dresser, our TV, our cat, our futon, our dishes. Nothing is allowed to be called 'mine' anymore and whenever I call something ""mine"" he gets upset. 

I miss having MY space and MY things. I want to be able to push my bed up against the wall, and buy a frozen pizza and sit in my livingroom and watch TV and be able to speak without being glared at or having his friends hear me and make fun of me, and I want to be alone without someone else in the next room listening to my every word or reading my every text.

 His name isn't on the lease. The landlord doesn't even know he lives here. I haven't told him yet because of the fact that I somehow KNEW this would happen. I wanted to make sure that I had an escape route incase things went sour.. I tried to talk to Ray the other day about possibly living sepeaately and he told me that if we don't live together then we can't be together because theres no way we can date and live separately. So basically getting my own space = being single.

 I can't move out anytime soon. My lease is up in June but even so, I have next to no money and I have nowhere else to go. I'm a full time student working a part time job. My rent is almost 700$ a month, and bills + food altogether is 900$. I have 1200$ in the bank and I make 100-200$ biweekly. I can't AFFORD to kick him out. The government won't help me, student loans can't give me anymore, I have an appointment at the bank but I'm doubtful that will do anything. I'm literally trapped.. I'm depressed, I cry all the time, I find myself making excuses to leave just to be alone and get away from him.

 What do I do? What can I do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Moved in with my boyfriend of 7 months too soon. Now I feel trapped, miserable and I'm financially dependant on him. I can't rearrange the furniture, or buy what I want, or do what I want and I have 0 privacy and I'm going crazy. He says if he has to move out then we have to breakup because we can't live separately and still be together. What the heck do I do?

 **Edit** I should add that its a very small one bedroom apartment and finding a roommate isn't gonna be easy considering that they'd have to sleep in the livingroom. My apartment is right beside my college and theres like 5 bus routes around me so its such a convenient spot I really don't wanna move :'(

 **Edit#2** This is a popular topic. BEFORE Ray moved on, I had more than enough hours to afford my apartment. But once my boss found out I was going to school he cut me back from 40 to 12 (if I was lucky) out of spite so I went from being able to save 200$ a month to maybe 20$ if I was lucky. And then, once school started, my savings were already cut in half from having to rely on it because of hour decreases, and my loans weren't that big so I ended up running out of money fairly quickly."

"[M22] How to tell my GF [24] her friends are not nice people?


Throwaway account as I know she browses Reddit.

So a bit of backstory, I met my GF after she worked in a local store and we would get chatting everytime I went in (which became everyday after we got chatting) til I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out. Everything has been going amazing for 5 months, we see each other almost everyday and we have both met each other's families and get on really well. She came out with me and a few friends at New year's for a party and they all loved her too which was great...

But I had never met any of her friends, I thought maybe she didn't have any which is fine so didn't want to ask. She then invited me to come shopping with 3 of her  ""best friends"" and a couple of their boyfriends. When my girlfriend was around her friends she became very quiet and reserved which I'd not really seen before. I ignored it and hung around outside with the other boyfriends who again we're not very nice people and would insult almost every girl that walked past. I got bored and said I would go look for the girls and I followed them around the shop holding bags and noticed her friends would insult her constantly. I'm not talking jokingly like I do with my guy friends I mean she would pickup clothes and they would say how awful it would look because she has fat legs and made a couple of fat jokes (she is not fat in the slightest but these girls are twigs) which she just awkwardly looked at me and then the floor. They continuously insulted her looks and attitude and even insulted my clothes a couple of times (would you insult someone you just met?) and I could see her getting visibly upset and embarrassed that I was seeing her like this. I changed the subject and said we should get food before leaving and when we got home she kind of just brushed me off and said "" I will see you tomorrow"", we said nothing more about it and met back up for a walk in the park a couple days later and she was back to her happy, bubbly self and we had a great day at the park.

But I don't know what to do, I despise her friends, they are truly awful people and I would never dare insult someone in that way and certainly not in front of their partner they are meeting for the first time. Even my closet guy friends would never insult someone in that way especially when they are clearly uncomfortable. I am just worried that if I bring it up then I might be overstepping and being too controlling, since she has been friends with these girls for years and only just met me. But they clearly upset her which I feel awful about,  this is still a new relationship though and I don't want to ruin it over something like this.

She has asked for me to come out to dinner with that same group of friends and I really don't want to, I am making every excuse not to go because I know they will say something that will upset my GF and I will lose my temper and most likely end up looking like the asshole.

Should I just ignore it or should I maybe ask why she is friends with them because they are so mean to her?

TLDR: My GFs friends use her as an emotional punching bag and I don't know if I should point it out."

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/62844h/i_23f_take_care_of_my_younger_brother_17m_but_i/)

Thank you to everyone that replied to my last post, I want to give you all an update since some people were asking. 

So that night I went over to Jay's and talked to him about everything that was going on, and he said he would have a talk with Ian about respect/communication. Ian stayed the weekend with Jay so that we could have some time away from each other and Jay talked to him about respect/communication/basically everything that was going on. 

I came home Friday after work and my whole house was cleaned! Jay and Ian both cleaned it while I was gone and it was really unexpected. It was very sweet of them. 

On Sunday Jay dropped Ian off at our apartment. I just got a 24 hour notice that we are having a property inspection, so I told Ian to make sure everything is picked up and that there is no marijuana or anything left out and not to smoke until the inspection is done because we live in a state where it is still illegal (he gets it from Jay and smokes on occasion, another issue I've had and forgot to mention in my last post). He said okay no problem.

A few hours later I go downstairs and the entire place reeks of marijuana. This happened after I explicitly told him not to smoke or have anything out because our property manager would be coming by in the morning. I was livid. At that point I went to his room and confronted him and he tried lying about it, but it was clear he was smoking because the whole house smelled like it and it didn't when he was gone. He also has done this in the past when we were having our A/C fixed, literally the exact same situation, and he did it again today. I could be evicted and lose my security deposit for this and I do not want to lose my place. All because he couldn't refrain from getting high for 1 day.

I called Jay and told him what was going on, and he was pretty mad, because he just preached to Ian about us respecting each other and then this happens right away. Jay told me to tell Ian to gather a few things because he's going to stay with him for a few days. I go and tell Ian, and he tells me he would just rather move in with Jay indefinitely.

So Jay came and picked up Ian and they packed a few of his things, and are getting the rest later once Jay and his wife clear out his basement. Ian told me he loved me before he left so I'm happy he at least doesn't hate me. Jay is 27 and is very responsible, and I know he will be able to care for him properly and hopefully give him the discipline he needs because I can't do it.

And that's where we're at now. This whole taking care of my younger brother before I've had a chance to figure out myself yet has really taken a toll on me, I just feel defeated. I feel really guilty and told Jay, but he said I need to look out for myself for once, and that Ian said he's happy things ended like this rather than things getting worse to the point where we're fighting. 

I'm in the process of looking for a roommate and don't think I'll have a problem finding one, but the uncertainty that I might not find one in a month is really gnawing at me. I am just full of so much anxiety right now. Ian also just paid his share of the rent and asked about getting it back, but since this wasn't expected and he decided to move out right away anyway without giving me a chance to find a replacement I need to keep it. I don't know how to politely tell him he isn't getting it back. I am going to need to have carpets cleaned before I get a roommate since he spilled a lot of things and did some damage to our carpet, and he never paid a security deposit (he didn't have money at the time), and will be using part of his rent to cover the cost. He also took the PS4 and most of the items I bought for his bathroom.

Thank you everyone who read this and replied and for all your kind words and advice. It has been a long stressful few months and I'm hoping things will look up soon.

"After supporting my (28f) bf (27m) through law school he was cheating with another woman need help dealing


Sorry for the typos in advance, i am writing this from my phone and feel so sick to my stomach right now but please help me. I need advice and reassurance that things will be better because Ive never felt so worthless in my life ever. 


My bf and I have been dating almost 6 years. Inthis time I found a great job in the restaurant business managing after working my way up from the bottom. My boyfriend and I moved in together shortly after he was accepted to law school. During this time we helped each other so much but especially for him I sacrificed a lot. I was the one making sure there was food on the table, planning fun events for us and just in general being supportive foe him when he needed it. Pack him lunches, review his papers, the whole 9 yards....i devoted myself to him because i loved him and i thought he loved me too. 


Well, a few hours ago I found a text that popped up in his locked home screen that said ""something for your dreams"" with a winky face. Of course I opened it to see, because there was no way that was platonic at all. Sure enough there is a naked photo of another woman, with a huge string of text messages dating back to almost TWO years ago. There was no evidence of them ever meeting or making plans but there was a lot of sexy messages and hundreds of nudes exchanged. 


Ny boyfriend at first was defiant and then denied everything and once I began crying he started to cry as well. He promises that it was just him being collosally dumb and filled with ego, wanting sexy messages feom other women ... but we have sex regularly and I thought we were good together and headed for marriage. He just got a job lined up with a good firm for this summer as well, and now I feel like a complete loser 


Do i forgive him? Weve been dating almost 6 years and he insists he loves me and has eyes for only me and immediately blocked and deleted all traces of said woman (i dont know if there are more) but I feel like a HUGE LOSER. I feel ive been pouring myself into helping him be the best possible person he can be during his time of stress even when I was tired with my job just to have him shower affections on another woman . He rarely calls me by nice names but he was telling her she was striking, beautiful, a goddess...tht also hurt me so much. 


Ive just kicked him out for the night and am alone in our place. He is blowing up my phone asking me to meet to talk tomorrow, begging for a second  chance. I have so many emotions running through my head right now. Where do I start? I know, ive been had. Im a chump. Please help. How do you even begin to process a betrayal like this ? I can't face my friends or family yet. They all were rooting for us to be engaged by the end of this year. 



Tldr: helped support boyfriend through law school while working fulltime myself, just found out today he was messaging another woman sexually for the past two years. I have no idea where to begin to process this."
"How to support my [23F] boyfriend's [24M] super annoying new hobby?


My long term (5 year) boyfriend has been wanting to play guitar since he was a kid. He just recently bought a guitar and is learning to play on his own. I'm really proud of him for taking this step and making himself practice, but, like most new musicians, he sounds awful. 

The guitar is loud, the apartment is small, and there is no escape when he decides to practice for an hour in the evening. His practice sessions are random, too, so I can't plan to be out of the house for a while.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend bought a guitar. I really want to support him, but practice is driving me up the wall. What can I do to encourage him but keep my sanity?

**Edit 1:** Wow, I had no idea my post would blow up so much. Thank you all for your input and encouragement! For a few FAQs, he is learning acoustic guitar, we are both college students, and the college won't let someone not in a music major (i.e. us) use the music rooms."
"My mom (40 F) is addicted to her phone and it is ruining not only her 25 year marriage but the whole family in general, what can I do?


I don't know where else to ask this so I hope this is okay. For the past 4 years my mother's phone addiction has gradually increased. She was always on Facebook 24/7 and still is. She is obsessed with social media: has Facebook, Whatsapp, Tango, Instagram, and Snapchat, but has my siblings and I blocked in them. When we were not blocked, all she would ever post was complains about my father, how she's always locked in the house (she is not), and she would constantly upload selfies and flirt with guys who commented. 

One year I ended up getting into her Facebook and I found messages where she is talking to other men on there, them being my father's cousins and one being my cousin's husband. Eventually, she reset her password and I got logged out. Now I can't see anything at all. I go to visit and all my mom does is look at her phone. We go to church, she's on it, we're eating, she's on it. It's gotten to the point where no one can touch her phone. Anytime I tried going near it she screamed or said she needed to text my brother, my dad recently grabbed her phone and she scratched the crap out of his arm, while trying to take it away from him (keep in mind that she has a passcode that no one knows).

 I have four brothers and the three youngest are being affected by her behavior alot. She acts like a teenager and doesn't pay any attention to my siblings, the youngest is 2 years old. My father has spoken to me and has decided to leave my mother because it's obvious that she is hiding something (his relatives have been telling him about her social media posts), he called my mom to tell her since she is not in town ( all of a sudden decided to go to kansas randomly &amp; took the 2 youngest siblings with her), she then calls me claiming that my dad is going crazy. I finally decided to tell her exactly how I felt and how everyone else feels, her response was "" You're not thinking right, I'll call you in the morning once you get some sleep."" 

Is there anything else I can do to help her understand that her phone is affecting her, has anyone else experienced this? 
TL;DR Not sure how to get my mom to stop using her phone constantly

Update: my mom is not in a bad situation guys, we are not some kind of family cult and she chose to be a mom at the age of 17. She mentions that she is locked in the house for ATTENTION. Not once did i put that she is because she is NOT. "

"My [F30] father [M60] tricked me into revealing my address to him even though I wanted to keep it a secret. Advice please!


So, my father and mom have been divorced since I was 9. Was a pretty ugly divorce. My mom and me moved across the country and naturally I don't see my father that often. We had an okay-ish relationship. 2 years ago I told him my future life plans (college, internship, etc.) and he just snapped and said pretty nasty things to me. Ever since that moment, our contact has been rare and superficial. I moved out of my mom's house and to a new city because I got a new job. I told him if he wants to send me mail, he can send it to my mom since I'm visiting her a lot and can just pick it up myself or she can forward it to me.


Yesterday, I got a text message from my cousin who I'm really close with. She asks for my address because ""mail wants to reach me"" (notice the passive tense?). Today she reveals that my father wants to invite me to his 60. birthday and she got pressured into asking me for my address. Not sure exactly who pressured her to get that information from me because she was at a family gathering (with my father, her mom etc. and they talked about me). 


Anyway, why am I so sensitive about revealing my address? Well, my father has the habit of showing up unannounced and I hate that. He even followed me twice to my vacation abroad just to surprise me.   
And I really really didn't want him to googleearth me and stalk my surroundings and know where I live. Or even worse, show up at my door step. Now I'm paranoid.


Any advice how to react? I'm pretty pissed because it's the principle! Tricking a person to reveal something I wanted to keep a secret, is just mean. Also, I don't wanna go to his birthday. 



tl;dr: Father tricked me into revealing my address even though he knew I didn't wanna give it to him. He used another person to get that info. I'm pissed."
