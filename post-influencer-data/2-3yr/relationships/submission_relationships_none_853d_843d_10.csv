"How do I [26F] tell my husband [31M] I'm addicted to drugs?


Backstory: My husband and I have been married for (almost) five years. He's amazing, I know everyone says that but he really is an incredible person. He's a great husband, treats me well, he's supportive and loving and just everything I need him to be. I think I'm a pretty good wife to him as well, with the exception of this one thing. 

I'm absolutely terrified to tell my husband I'm addicted to amphetamines. I need help and he deserves to know what his wife is doing but I can't bring myself to say the words. I don't want to be a source of stress or anxiety for him. I'm worried about how this could change his opinion of me or our relationship. I'm obviously ashamed of myself too. I think the idea of facing reality and giving up the drugs is part of it as well.

I'm unable to control this anymore. I bought meth for the second time this month despite swearing to myself I wouldn't do it again. I take dangerously high doses of Adderall and Dexedrine. I've lost weight- my BMI was on the lower end of normal to begin with and I'm borderline underweight now. My eyes look sad. I'm sleepy whenever I'm not high. I feel absolutely horrible about myself and I'm really scared.  

I love him so much. I feel like a liar for keeping this from him. At the same time I'm worried about what it will do to him. He knows *something's* up. He's a Firefighter-Paramedic and interacts with people on drugs often so I wouldn't be surprised if it's crossed his mind. I'm fairly good about hiding it though, I limit my use to nights he's at work. We still spend time together. Our sex life is fine. He's pretty busy because he helps with his father's business in addition to working (he really is amazing). It's possible he has no idea and I'm about to drop this on him out of nowhere. 

If anyone has been in this position or has advice I'd like to hear it (and appreciate you sharing). I honestly don't know what to say or how to begin the conversation. He's home today and I want to get it over with. I want to cry every time I look at him.

Edit: This is complicated by the fact that my only real friend where we live uses these drugs. My relationship with her has to end and I'm a little sad about it. She's more involved than I am and doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. There's no option but to go our separate ways. I'm probably looking for excuses to avoid talking to him too.

**Update**: Thank you for the encouraging and kind responses. I told him. 

He didn't know. He knew something was wrong but thought it had to do with depression. My cousin and best friend committed suicide last year; her birthday was in April and next month is the anniversary of her death. It makes sense he attributed anything different to something like depression. He was concerned about an eating disorder too. Also, I encapsulated the meth and took it orally. It was like a strong Adderall. I wasn't behaving like a stereotypical tweaker (like the people you see on TV). I'm only adding this to clarify the situation, not to minimize it. It's still meth. But I understand why he didn't suspect it. I'm also the last person anyone would suspect of doing drugs, especially meth. I used to teach kindergarten to give you some perspective. Other than experimenting in my late teens and my current situation I've never really used drugs or alcohol. 

I'm so grateful for this man. He might be an actual Saint. When I told him he just put his arms around me and said ""I love you. Everything's going to be okay."" I just cried and cried. Then *he* started crying and I honestly wanted to die. He was very concerned about my health. He asked a few questions about headaches and my vision and wanted to check my blood pressure. He made me give him the drugs. He had a *really* hard time believing I was doing meth until he saw it. Then we talked some more and that's when he told me he was concerned about my mental health but never suspected drugs. He definitely had questions and I answered everything honestly. I made sure to take responsibility and chose my words carefully. This is the result of my bad decisions and nothing else. It's been a rough and emotional night but I feel better after telling him. 

It was easier than I thought. I wish I hadn't waited so long to tell him. I feel so much better about quitting now, like stronger in a way, and it's such a relief to have this off my chest. It's like I can finally move forward. We talked a little bit about how to handle things but didn't make any solid plans yet. I'm contacting my old therapist tomorrow to make an appointment. I'm considering something like NA but I'm not religious so we'll see. I'm open to suggestions if anyone has them. 

**Update 2**: I just want to say thank you again for the supportive comments and messages. I appreciate all of you taking the time to reply or write to me. I've read everything but I'm tired and anxious and haven't been able to respond to everyone (sorry about that). My husband is at work now and I'm waiting for 9:00 to call the therapist's office. I'm reading up on NA in the meantime.

  **tl;dr**: I need to tell my husband about my drug addiction but I don't know where to begin. I abuse amphetamines, recently got into meth, and I need to get this under control before it gets any worse. "

"[UPDATE] Me [26 F] with a Friend [28 F] of 2 years. She wants people to treat her one way, but she is treating me the exact opposite.


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69k897/me_26_f_with_a_friend_28_f_of_2_years_she_wants/

So Jessica messaged me the other day flipping out. She was mad, because she had found out that 2 acquaintances that graduated before us are having a small Wedding Shower with just close friends and immediate family on Campus. She found out because another friend asked to stay with her that weekend, both to see Jessica and to go to the shower. Jessica isn't invited to the shower, because she isn't that close to the couple. She saw it as a great personal insult and ranted and raved at me about how much she hates all of them and has now cut off both the couple and the other friend.

 Then things got nasty. I tried to get her to calm down and she starts talking about how she is doing to crash the party and make sure they are miserable and how she hopes they divorce or if they try to have kids that all they get are miscarriages. Really hateful things.

 Then she starts going on about how everyone is treating her like the bad guy for doing these things, when really ""they are making [her] do them."" I told her off in a major way and told her I was going to contact the couple to warn them. She then told me ""That I of all people should understand her pain, because of how Tim treated me (who she still talks to) and Go F*** myself"" and unfriended and blocked me. 

I have contacted the couple and warned them and they are taking precautions. Not sure what to do next. Kinda glad the toxicity is gone. I am also really thankful for the advice you all gave me. 


TL:DR- Hypocritical ""friend"" showed her mean and spiteful side and unfriended me. "
"I [25M] fell in love with my best friend [24F] she has a disability and I want to assure her, and her parents I'm in it for the long run. How should I go about this?


Throw away because she redits

I met Mia at college when we were both 18 years old, I was an extremely sheltered, shy kid from a tiny town and I was sitting at a table in the cafeteria of a huge college in a major city. I was looking down at my tray, thinking I made the worst decision ever when someone rolled up next to me. It was Mia, and she was in a wheelchair. Honestly I saw her before the chair, she's freaking gorgeous, and honestly you notice her nose ring and long curly hair before you notice the chair. She had me laughing so hard, milk sprayed out of my nose. 

From that day forward we were inseparable, and we spent tons of time together. Forward almost seven years and we've been friends through some crazy times, us graduating, my step mom (basically my mom) going through breast cancer (she's in remission), graduate school, and two surgeries for her. I pretty much knew I was in love with Mia a few years ago, I even admitted it once three years ag (after getting drunk) and she shot me down. 

She admitted she had feelings for me but she said that dating her was a commitment she didn't want me to undertake. She has a form of muscular dystrophy, she says fortunately she has the kind that is slow acting and won't shorten her lifespan too shortly. However there is a lot that goes into her care, most of which she does on her own or has an aide for.  Most likely she cannot have children and she knows that I love kids and want to have some someday. So she's was adamant about us not dating.

Her friendship means more to me than being in a relationship, so I stayed friends with her and just enjoyed that. I dated off and on nothing serious as I worked full time and I attended school. Until a few months ago, Mia came to me in tears, she admitted she loved me too and if she never acted on it she'd regret it. Seriously these last few months have been the best months of my life.

So last night I was over Mia's parents house with her and we were in her bedroom watching tv . I went to use the bathroom and overheard her mom telling her dad that while they love me they worry about Mia getting hurt. They worry I'm not in in for the long run and I don't understand or know what a future with her entails. Honestly you guys I'm so in love with this girl, there's no doubt in my mind she's the one. I'm under no illusion our lives may not be always easy but I don't care. As for kids, adoption is always an option, and honestly yes I love kids but I love her more. 

I just want to know how I can tell this to her and her parents. Let them know that I've done research on her condition, I'm in the medical field. I've even talked to a support group that deals with people with MD and their families. I'm here for whatever. I just don't know how I can say this?

Edit: I sat down with her folks this afternoon when Mia was getting a shower by her Aide. I showed them this Reddit and both of them got very emotional. They said that they are very happy I'm in her life. That If this is truly what I want and I'm aware our life won't be easy that they give their blessing. I then showed Mia this as well. She cried and gave me a big hug. She knows now I'm serous and I'm in this for the long run. Thank you guys so much for your kind words, and upvotes. I apologize for any grammar mistakes or misspelled words. English isn't my first or my second language, I'm learning but occasionally I screw up :) 

TL;DR: I'm head over heels for my Best friend of seven years who I've been dating for a few months. How can I tell her and her family her disabilities don't scare me?"
"My [26F] former best friend [27M] just started volunteering at my work and brought up our personal lives to my boss, who is now asking me if she should fire him or not.


Posting from my throwaway cause who knows if he's a redditor.

I work for an organization that runs on a hybrid model (volunteers, staff, supervisors, directors, etc). I started 6 months ago as a volunteer and a month later was offered one of the full time staff positions because.. well, I'm awesome. 

I had this former friend, let's call him John. We had a few other guys we were close friends/roommates with for many years, and one day I guess they all realized I had boobs and long story short, shit got really out of hand. They made me feel horrible about myself, I was losing my best friends and everything was super complicated, and I was fucking miserable. I had asked them all to stay out of my life and never talk to me again, in more or less words. This happened a year and a half ago. It was hard for me, but I've since moved on to better things, I have good friends, I'm seeing someone who is great to me, I have a good job, and most importantly, I'm fucking happy. I still miss my friends - that will never change - but I know I am better off without their drama. 

So anyway: John, who had actually really hurt me, is in our newest training group. They did a tour of the workplace, and there is a bulletin board in the back with pictures of our volunteers and staff. He saw me on the board and figured out that I work there. I still had no idea he had joined the team. 

I had a long weekend for my birthday. And then I came into work and my boss pulled me aside and told me that one of our volunteers had approached her and said that *he* doesn't have a problem working with *me*, but knows that *I* don't want to work with *him*. My boss basically said ""who the hell is this, what's he talking about, and is this a problem for you"". I was very blindsided by it and did not know what to say. She told me that if I wasn't okay with it, she would ask him to leave, and I would keep my job. I asked for a day or two to wrap my head around what was happening. 

Here's the thing: I'm as ""over it"" as I will ever be. I don't give a shit. If he had come in and worked there, I would have hoped we could have been civilized when we were at work. The only thing I would have asked him is that he keep our personal lives private. I am not the kind of person who brings that crap to work with me. 

Apparently we are beyond that point. The guy hasn't even started working there yet, I didn't even know he was, and yet my *boss* is coming to me asking if I have a problem with it. I feel like he has *created* conflict and spun it around like I'm the issue here. A week ago my job was going great. 

I absolutely do not *want* to work with him, and he obviously knows that. Yet he wasn't offering to leave. Was he hoping I'd be fired so he could volunteer there? Is he *trying* to weasel himself back into my life? What the fuck is he doing bringing my boss into this, or bringing our personal drama into work?

I need to give my boss an answer on whether or not I'm okay with this. I keep bouncing back and forth. I do not want my personal life getting in the way of their business. I would have thought he and I could remain civilized and that *if* a problem came up, addressed it then like adults. Apparently a problem has already come up, or I wouldn't be having this conversation with my boss. He has not made an effort to say anything to me, only my boss. I have nothing against him anymore, yet I am *pissed* that he has brought my personal shit from the past into my work and that my boss is involved in my two-year-old drama. 

Am I a shitty employee if I ask her to fire his ass? Am I overreacting and should just ignore it - but then how do I know he won't be bringing this up all the time, or talking to coworkers about my personal shit? Should I send him a message and give him the chance to leave on his own before they have to ask him to, or has he already burned that bridge? 

I've been stewing for a couple days now and I am running out of time to give my boss an answer, so in a desperate last ditch attempt, I am seeking your guidance Reddit. 

TLDR: guy I was really close to a year and a half ago but haven't seen since then started volunteering at my work and told my boss that I'll have a problem with it, and now she's waiting for me to decide if he should be fired or not and I don't know what to say because I didn't even know he was working there until he told my boss about it, thus creating a problem before he even starts working there.

"Me [29/F] with my new husband [28 M] of less than a year. My family rags on me constantly but I don't want to cut them out for my daughter's [6/F] sake. Ideas?


When I was 22, I got pregnant with a baby and the baby's father booted it. I told him and never saw him again. That left me and my daughter, Mel, alone together. It was hard, but I love being everything to my daughter. 

I was able to take a night program, got a job and took a huge gamble and asked this really nice guy on a date. It paid off and 3 years together and we got married (just this past April). A first for both of us. Okay, so far so good. 

I dated my SO for a year before I introduced him to Mel. Mel wasn't sure about him at first - she was nervous and would hide or was abnormally quiet; but, that quickly changed. Mel liked having my SO's attention - it was a new person to play with and mommy is boring/rule maker/not as funny. So, they grew quite close, quite quickly. 

Once we moved in together, Mel stuck her toe in the water and would call him anything but his name - peeps, paw, meowmeow, etc. Then it was ""hey, dah..."" and then it was just ""daddy."" From that point forward, she's been effectively glued to him. 

She wants her dad to dry her hair after the bath; she wants her dad to take her to the doctor; she wants her dad to help her. I said ""Oh shoot, I broke something"" and she just said: ""Eh, don't worry, daddy will be here soon and take care of it."" Having a husband that loves/dotes on a daughter that isn't his own is amazing. It's also amazing to have a daughter who loves my SO. 

Things aren't so bad. But, my family won't let me forget the sins of my past. We're a WASPY group and getting knocked-up was a huge ""fail."" Despite making it through night school to become a nurse, I am always the fuck-up in their eyes. I've been told this as many ways as possible. My daughter's biodad is Mexican, so she's darker than us and while they love her, they frequently point-out that my poor decision making skills led to a child being brought into this world. My mother takes shots at me; she's openly lamented that post-baby vaginas are ""dangly"" and then elbowed my husband. She mocked my ability to be a nurse - my husband had a hernia so I took time off to care for him after surgery. He loved having his side-kick hang with him while I cared for him. My mother visited and asked if he needed a home care service to 'properly' look after him. She'll tell him how hard it must be to accept us (me and our daughter) as is and she ""understands"" his struggle. If I make a mistake (incredibly minor) my sisters will tsk tsk me and remind me that I **always** make mistakes. My sisters and mother will tell my husband what a great guy he is for ""his charity."" 

My SO's parents are also WASPY - but... different. They called recently and asked that I come to their house with my daughter. Alone. My SO can't travel (because of work) this month and they want the opportunity to spend a week with me and their granddaughter so that they can bond. The idea of spending a week in California with my in-laws sounds relaxing and fun. Dinner with my parents? I get nauseous. We've booked a trip coming up in a few days. This has caused tension with my family. 

I keep my parents/family in my life because they love their grand-daughter/niece. They love to see her and spend an afternoon with her. On the other hand, I can't live with more of their BS. I'm closer to my in-laws than my own parents and can't handle more of my family's crap. I don't want to go no contact with them, but every time I've laid-down the law or fought back, it's been met with indifference and a refusal to change. I'm coming to a breaking point. 

My husband will support me 100% and thinks I need to do what's right for my sanity. I'm just not sure I'm ready to do that. Ideas?

"I [21F] hate who I am when I'm in relationships


I become this awful, insecure, and jealous individual and at times... I can't even recognize myself. When I'm single and free to do as I please, everything is amazing and I feel most ""myself"". But as soon as I enter a relationship and the ball starts rolling, I find myself slowly beginning to resent the individual I'm with because I have these expectations in my head that aren't satisfied. Or the things they do end up seeming annoying when they're really not at all?


I've spent quite a bit of time as a single gal because of this. It has stopped me from entering serious relationships with people who I care deeply for because I'm afraid that this part of me will unearth itself and I will most likely end up hurting said person (because I can't be a normal, loving partner). **Does anyone else experience this? Does anyone know why this happens?**


  **tl;dr**: I turn into an angrier/more insecure version of myself when I enter relationships which has stopped me from pursuing such things altogether"

I've known my mother for 27 years, 27 years and nine months if we're going to get technical. For the past few months or possibly the past few years she's been seeing a psychic. I struggle with mental health issues, namely alcoholism and pretty serious anxiety/depression and my mother has become convinced by him that I have a demon which may lead me to commit some violent crime. She showed me the Facebook conversation they had on the topic and he was saying that while I'm not dangerous the demon could lead me to do bad things.

She would like me to take part in an exorcism (I cannot believe I am even typing this). It would only cost 400$ (quite the bargain) and while I do really want to meet this person to get some kind of insight into this weird fucking situation I'm not sure if getting involved with him in any capacity is a good idea. I'm also offended and worried that he's telling my mother that I might commit some terrible act one day and she's believing him.

"I [22F] am sick of my boyfriend [24M] (2 years) always talking about a female video game character.


I'm new to this subreddit, made a throwaway because my boyfriend is on reddit. I apologize if this is really long, I just need to vent. Also, I can't figure out how to flair.

So I've been dating this guy for two years. Last year, this video game came out, and he has been obsessed with this one female character. (Y'all can probably guess which game.) He has her as his computer wallpaper, phone wallpaper, ringtone, he has shirts with her logo on it, fan art, a decal on his car, and he wants figurines of her. 

He literally mentions her at LEAST once a day, and when I get annoyed, he finds it amusing. He doesn't get how insecure it makes me. And when I call him out on it, he gets all defensive, and he tells me that he loves me, and that it's just a character in a game, so it's not like she could actually steal him away from me. Which to me, sounds like if she were real, or if he happened to stumble upon a girl that was very similar to her in looks and personality, he would totally leave me for her. 

And he'll do annoying shit like when we're having a nice cuddle, he'll trace her whisker marks on my cheeks, and then act like he doesn't know why I'm upset.

He was the one who recently introduced me to reddit, and even showed me how to add friends and see their posts and comments.Today, he wanted to show me a comment he made on some post (it was about things you secretly find cute about your SO, and he found a way to mention her in there), so while I was on my lunch break, I decided to scroll through his post history to see what else he posts about. 90% of his comments, and his last few posts, are about this video game character, some of which were saucy fan art.

He always gets upset when I bring up the fact that he talks about her, and says he feels like I'm saying I want to break up. Well, sometimes I wonder if I should, because I really fucking hate feeling this way. And I feel like I've had this conversation with him at least once a month.

How do I deal with the fact that my boyfriend is overly obsessed with this video game character? I used to have obsessions with fictional characters, but once he and I started dating, all those feelings pretty much stopped, and it annoys me that his feelings haven't. 

Or should I just break up with him? I love him, and I want to marry him someday, but I don't want to feel like I'm competing with video game characters for the rest of my life.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend is obsessed with a video game character, constantly talks about her (to me and on reddit) and has/wants tons of her merchandise, and finds it amusing when I get jealous. When I get too upset, he gets butthurt for a while, stops for a day, and then the cycle starts again. How do I get him to stop? Or do I just learn to deal with it? Or should I just leave him?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice everyone! I was starting to doubt myself, thinking maybe I was overreacting, but it seems most of you don't think I'm overreacting. I talked to my boyfriend, this time making it clear that what he's doing really hurts me and is disrespectful. If he does it again, I'm just going to link him to this post and tell him it's over. I hope it doesn't come to that though.

**UPDATE: I don't know which of you fuckers managed to find my boyfriend and send him a link to this post. But thanks. He's finally realized how serious I was about the whole thing. He actually left work early and drove two hours to talk to me about it in person. We're on the same page now.**

We've been dating for 9+ years. We've lived together for 6. As with any long term relationship, there have been ups and downs. 

After about the 6 year mark, people started wondering when we'd get engaged. I think she started wondering this. I felt that I wasn't ready. Something wasn't right. 

Somehow, at some point, I completely fell out of love. She's my best friend, but I have no romantic feelings whatsoever. I've tried to find ways to get these feelings back, but they're just not there. 2 years ago,we moved back to the city where we first met. There were a number of reasons for this, but I also hoped that this would help us/me find those feelings again. It did not help. 

Last night, she knew something was wrong. It took awhile, but eventually I broke down and explained that I no longer have feelings, and I didn't think we could move forward. She started bargaining and trying to remind me of the good parts of our relationship. She wants to fight to keep us together. I don't. I remember the good times fondly, but I feel like I'm not the same person I was back then. I know there is no way to do this without hurting her, but I'm trying to help her understand why I'm doing this. 

I wrote a letter because I feel like is one of the only ways I can explain this without one or both of us breaking down. I've anonymized some parts for obvious reasons. I haven't shown this to her yet, but do you all think this is a good idea? I think she thinks I'm just depressed and wants to help me through it. I so appreciate that about her, but I need her to know that I am not in this any more. 

------------- The letter -----------

**EDIT:** Due to some disturbing private messages, I've removed the contents of the letter. In it, I described my internal struggle and tried to explain why I had reached the conclusion that I did. I realize from some of the comments here that it was probably more harmful than anything. 

If anyone is interested in reading it, I'm happy to PM you, but I think it's probably better that I don't leave it here in its entirety.

"My sister wants me to meet ""the other man.""


Tl;Dr My older sister [26] had been married to my sweet brother-in-law [24] for not even a year before she had an affair with someone at her job. My brother-in-law found out the next day and now they're getting a divorce. Well, my sister is now pursuing a relationship with ""the other man"" [27] and she wants me to meet him. (Mind you, this all happened in the span of a few weeks). 

This relationship is inappropriate beyond measure and goes against everything I morally stand for. I do NOT want to meet this man, let alone have any kind of brother-sister relationship with him. My sister is very hurt and upset by this. She's been guilt tripping me big time and telling me how hurt she is that I refuse to meet him and that she'd do the same for me; if it were the other way around. And apparently, by refusing to meet him, I'm ""projecting my morals onto everyone else"" according to her.

Redditors, I'm disgusted. But I also feel bad. Am I wrong for not wanting to meet this guy? My sister and I have always been very close but I'm still very hurt and disgusted with the awful decisions she's made. And it looks like my sister won't want to have as close a relationship with me anymore because I don't want to meet him. 

Any thoughts? "
"[Update] Me [42M] with my Fiancee [38F] of 1.5 years, were planning on moving into together and things fell apart.


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6b44us/me_42m_with_my_fiancee_38f_of_15_years_were/ 

I spoke with Amy today about our future.  I expressed that I was concerned that our relationship was emotionally abusive and that I can't subject my daughters to that environment.

She then went on the attack and started to tell me that I'm emotionally abusive and listed things that I have done to make her feel that way.  She then went on to chastise my about letting my teenagers run my life and that she's blown away that I would ask her to marry her and then suggest the timing wasn't right.

She continued about my daughters saying that they are hard to communicate with and that she's frustrated that they would rather sleep in instead of getting up and going for a hike.  She said she doesn't agree with how they were raised and that she's tried to incorporate them into her life by inviting us to do things.  The thing she doesn't realize is that she doesn't interact with them on these outings.  She then said that her 5 year old daughter wasn't excited to move in with us and that my daughters are just playmates to her and that she sees them as only wanting to sleep and watch tv.

I thought it was a crazy low blow bringing my kids into it.  She then continued on about how I'm making her out to be the villain and I'm the victim.  This continued via text for almost the entire day. Finally, she told me that she hasn't been treated this poorly since her ex whom she hates.  She said she wished I would have just left her alone (not sure what she meant).

I feel like I dodged a huge bullet.  She didn't really care about me nor my daughters.


**Edit:  My daughters and I had a really nice conversation last night. They told me that they are very happy we aren't moving with Amy. They never felt comfortable with her and would have been really mad at me if we moved with her.
This was our last night in our house. We sat around talking about life, our house, and our future. I haven't felt this close to them in a while. It felt so amazing.
Thank you for all of your feedback. I have no doubts I made the right decision. :-)

"My [50s-ish F] aunt and grandma [70s F] snuck my estranged mother into my graduation...need help telling them how hurt and weirded out I am


Apologies, this will be long, but I am extremely hurt and confused right now and I'm having trouble getting my thoughts together.

Yesterday, I graduated law school. They way our graduation works, we have a set amount of tickets we can distribute to family members. A few months ago, my maternal aunt and grandmother started insisting they come to my graduation. For context, they live on the east coast and my graduation is in the midwest. They did not come to my high school or college graduations (which were less than an hour away from them), but they absolutely want to buy a plane ticket and visit me in the midwest when they've never asked to do so before, even though I've been living here for years. I think this is odd, but I figure the real reason is they want an excuse to come see Chicago (where I live). 

I am being cynical about this trip because I have no relationship with my mother. Long story short, **she left abruptly when I was 16** by leaving a note on the bed saying she didn't want to be my mother anymore because my brother and I fought too much (we did't, we maybe had some skirmishes but we were 16 and 12, it was regular sibling stuff). I find out the real reason is a combination of untreated severe mental illness, possible drug addiction, and a possibly abusive relationship with my father. She was a terrible parent even before this, constantly putting me down about my weight, always crying to me at a young age about how she couldn't afford to pay any bills and she felt empty/nothing inside, she would always pit my brother and I against each other for attention, she used to dress proactively even though she knew it made us all uncomfortable, she had a hard time keeping jobs and friendships (she insisted women were always too jealous of her). 

ANYWAY, **I haven't spoken to my mother since she left** for many reasons. At first I was just hurt about what happened. I knew she planned to leave my father (which I was alright with, I knew even at 16 that unhappy people shouldn't stay married to each other). But she left me and my brother behind with no warning, and then blamed us. After a while, therapy etc, I finally realized it wasn't my fault and I kind of came to terms with my anger.

This doesn't mean I thought it was a good idea to start another relationship with her, though. She refuses to get help for whatever mental illness she has, and even though my younger brother saw her about a year ago to reconnect, he still doesn't have much of a relationship with her and says she's still very much the same person.

**My aunt (mom's sister) and grandmother (mom's mother) have, for the past ten years, tried at every turn to get me to make up with her.** I only see them once a year around Christmas (out of respect, because they're still family). Every single interaction I have with them, they will try to manipulate me into seeing her again. I couldn't possibly give examples of every time, but they have refused to give me Christmas presents unless I let her give them to me,  my grandmother accused me of hurting my deceased grandfather because his alleged dying wish was for us to reunite as a family and I was too selfish to let that happen, they've pulled aside my boyfriend the first time meeting him and tried to convince HIM to talk me into seeing my mother ""before she dies"" (I have confirmed she is not sick in any way). 

Every time something like this happens, I use the techniques I learned in therapy to calmly explain that this is manipulative, it is hurtful, and it is disrespectful to me. Even if they don't agree with my choices, they need to respect them because I am an adult. I have never (not even in my teenage anger) told them to not associate with her, how could they take her side over mine, etc. Their relationship with her is 100% their own business. I ONLY ASK FOR THE SAME COURTESY. This has lead to fighting, screaming, and crying on their part. **My main reason for not reconnecting is that she still has untreated mental illness, and I am afraid letting her back into my life right before I take the bar will cause distractions and major emotional upheaval.** I have explained this to them in detail many, many times over the years. It's not out of anger, but self-care.

**So, I give them tickets to my graduation.** I absolutely do not want them there, but they are still my aunt and grandmother and I didn't want to tell them they COULDN'T come. We actually had a super nice day, they bought me gifts, told me they were proud of me, and none of the cards sneakily mentioned how they were secretly from my mom (they do that with presents frequently) or poems about how God will only let me into heaven if I forgive my mother (also happened many times).

Then, late last night **my aunt texts me a picture of my MOTHER creeping IN THE BACK OF THE GRADUATION THEATER.** She said they had flown her to Chicago and snuck her into the theater and I ""should know.""

**I cannot fucking believe this.** They didn't ask because they KNEW I would feel uncomfortable, weirded out, and deceived. She doesn't get to be a part of my life, share in the goods things, the things I've worked very, very hard to accomplish without her. They did this behind my back and I KNOW they feel proud of themselves. 

**Reddit, please, what do I even say to this??** I ignored it last night because I was literally speechless. My mother is here in this city and I'm afraid they're going to try to ambush me somewhere (they know where my apartment is). I don't know how I should even respond to this. **How do I tell them how fucked up this is, and that they can't do this ever again, and I feel SO hurt and like I'm falling apart, that they ruined an incredibly nice memory.** It was the first time in YEARS we had an interaction that didn't involve guilting me into talking to my mother, but that was all a lie.

Please help

  **tl;dr**: My aunt and grandmother snuck my estranged mother (who I haven't seen or spoke to in ten years) into my law school graduation. This is approaching the last straw for me and I need advice on how to tell them

--

**UPDATE**

Thank you SO MUCH, Reddit. So many people gave their congratulations and encouraging words!! Every single commenter was substantially in agreement that I needed to go NC with them and that is what I decided to do. I texted them both (contents below) that I need no contact with them until they prove they can respect my boundaries (I highly doubt they ever will). I also gave explicit instructions to my father, brother, and boyfriend not to answer any of their calls or texts, not to give them any information about me, and not to pass along to me any messages from them. 

I am spending this Mother's Day out in the suburbs with my wonderful boyfriend's family (his mom, aunt, and grandmother) who I've come to think of as part of my own family. 

Despite my family's betrayal, I'm trying not to let this ruin my memory of graduating from law school or ruin my experience of Mother's Day. I have other amazing women in my life that deserve my attention today and I plan to honor them without feeling down about my biological family. 

Thank you Reddit for helping me come to terms with a difficult but necessary decision. 

Content of the text I sent my aunt and grandmother:

*I took some time to make sure I wasn't responding emotionally. I can't put into words the hurt and betrayal I feel. I invited you to share in a momentous day in my life that should have been about my accomplishment and you made it about her, just like every visit I spend with you. I have spent the last nine years explaining, patiently and clearly, how I feel and asking for nothing more than your respect. It is clear that you put my mother's desires above my own comfort and dignity yesterday. You knew what you did was wrong, that's why you didn't ask me what I wanted and instead snuck her into an event you knew I did not want her to be a part of. For the last several years, I have taken it upon myself to see you and talk to you because you are my family. But there can be no relationship without mutual trust and respect. There is neither between us at this point. I need to take some time to deal with this. You did not respect my boundaries when I repeated them verbally over and over so I have to enforce them another way. Do not call or contact me in any way. Do not call my family or my boyfriend trying to get in touch with me because it will not work. Unless and until I can feel like you love and respect me for me, not just as an opportunity to push my mother back into my life, I need time apart. I have tried asking you in the past, but this time I am telling you.*

"I (24M) recently met my father (55M) for the first time along with 4 ""new"" siblings (7-19). I'm struggling with resolving the fact that I like them with hatred for my father.


I have one other post in my account that briefly breaks down my growing up without a dad and my first time meeting him. Since that meeting, I cooled down and have started to slowly build a relationship with him, and now with my siblings.

I still have a ton of hate for him and resentment/jealousy for my siblings. I feel twisted up in my own emotions. With regard to my father, I see him as a coward and a piss ass excuse for a father for abandoning me. I also admire the man as a father to my siblings, a husband to his wife and an owner of his business. He's charismatic, funny, confident. In many ways, he's the type of man I always dreamed of becoming.

I have too much of a chip on my shoulder. I'm insecure. I'm angry all the time. I'm easily annoyed and people often tell me I look angry or annoyed or intense. The worst is when women who I think I've been flirting with tell me I look intimidating. And I can't turn it off. I don't even notice that I'm looking this way or giving off this energy.

At the same time as I find myself admiring my father for the qualities mentioned above, I hate him for it. My younger brothers have these qualities. And I feel cheated. What made them worthy of a father and me unworthy? Why was their mother worth standing by and mine was disposable? 

I feel further twisted because I have fallen in love with my siblings. On one hand, I'm jealous. I see the home they grew up in. I see the comaraderie they have between one another. I see that finances have not been a constant source of stress for them as it was for me. They didn't worry about their safety in the neighborhood they grew/are growing up in.

And I resent that. 

I feel like shit, though. Because when I flew out to meet them, I made that entire flight with hate in my heart. I was so full of rage I cried on that plane. I was so ready to hate them. So ready to tell them what a piece of cowardly shit their father was. But when I saw them look at me and they had nothing but love for me in their eyes.

My 19 year old sister cried and held onto me. She told me how happy she was that she had a big brother. She told me how badly she wanted to get to know me.

My 7 year old sister ran to me like she knew me her whole life and jumped into my arms. She was so proud of me. So proud to have me as a brother she kept shouting to her mom and dad to take pictures of us alone so she could show her friends.

My 12 and 17 year old brothers grinned at me from ear to ear. Asked me to play games with them and to show them ""judo moves"". And that last bit is what got me.

I only told my father I do judo. I didn't tell his wife. That means he's been talking about me to them. 

I feel, at the same time, pride, anger, and shame. I feel proud that I finally have a dad that brags on me and siblings that look up to me. I feel anger at the abandonment and like I want him to pay. I don't want it to simply be swept under the rug. And I feel shame for being so ready to hate people who were eager to love me.

Please help me to sort through these emotions.

Tl;dr- I recently met my father and 4 siblings. I feel like I'm contorted and I could use some help unpacking the feelings of anger, pride, and shame that have been brought on.
