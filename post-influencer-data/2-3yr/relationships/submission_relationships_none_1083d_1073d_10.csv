"Update: I [28F] hate my boyfriend's [28M] beard.


Soo, my post from a few months ago didn't get a lot of attention but I wanted to post an update anyway. Here's the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m8j4m/i_28_hate_my_bfs_28m_beard/

Basically, my bf grew a disgusting beard that he didn't take care of and food got caught in it all the time. It was seriously affecting our sex life but he kept telling me I would learn to love his beard one day. Also, all our families and friends said the beard was great which was super weird because it wasn't. 

So, I did what some people suggested and told him I couldn't bring myself to have sex with him unless he starts grooming his beard because I'm so disgusted by it. He kind of laughed it off but after a week I guess he realized I was serious. 

So one day we met for dinner after work and he got there clean shaven and with a bouquet of roses. During dinner, he asked me if I honestly didn't remember. I had no idea what he was talking about. That's when he told me that 6 or 7 years ago, when we celebrated Christmas with my family and my grandfather was asking when the two of us would ""finally"" get married, my bf said we would get married when his beard was as long as my grandfather's (who has somewhat of a Santa Claus beard). 

For a few months  after that incident, it was like a running joke between the two of us, whenever he didn't shave for a few days, I told him to watch out or he would have to marry me. Apparently that was when he decided he would grow out his beard before proposing. Only he thought it would be too obvious and I would know what was coming, and I completely forgot about the whole situation and now I feel kind of bad about forgetting the whole joke between us. He said when I told him the beard was disgusting he thought I was just joking around because I wanted to know if he would really go through with growing it out grandfather style. 

Our friends and families were all in on it and that's why they kept saying the beard was great. So, long story short, the beard is gone and we are engaged. I guess this might seem a bit childish to a lot of people, but it made my grandfather happy and I think the original idea was kind of sweet (even though the beard wasn't).

  **tl;dr**: Bf only grew out his beard because of an inside joke we had years ago that I completely forgot about. We are now happily engaged and he shaves again. Yay!"

I just want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post. This issue is such a non-issue that I can't believe how seriously you all took me. All the tips, caution, the encouragement just reminded me how wonderful everyone here can be.


Thanks to you guys and the post I made, I was reminded of all the wonderful qualities and reasons I fell in love with my boyfriend and I decided to send him some pictures. It took awhile to find one I felt comfortable with, but I did find one! I know some people think I shouldn't, but I did include my face in it because I feel like it helped show how much I trust Ben and how much I love him.


I waited until the late evening when he told me how he was getting ready for head off to bed when I messaged him with a picture and then sent ""More surprises when you get back ;)"" and I'll admit, I got a little panicky. After a few minutes, Ben sent a message back with ""Oooh very sexy! &lt;3"" and pretty much that was that (Outside of our usual goodnights and I love yous).


I'll admit it, reddit, I didn't know how to take his message back on account of having never sent a photo like this before. Was he being nice? Was this a typical response which was good? Should he have said more? Should I have said more? I didn't know how to feel other than a little disappointed, especially with how long it took me to take the photo. Alongside this, Ben sent me a message the next day telling me about how busy he'll be and then never responded back. I got upset and started feeling like I made a mistake. I spent my day off work with a mix of disappointment, regret and panic, a panic that I had made a huge mistake.


Well, that afternoon I got a knock at my door and who was there? Ben. That's who was at my door. Ben and a bunch of flowers. I wasn't expecting him for a few more days and before I could say anything he told me about how he pulled a favor with his boss (whom he's friendly with) and because the team had pretty much finished up their project he got the go ahead to head home early. Ben told me that he saw the picture and was speechless for a few minutes because he had never expected anything like that from me but knew he had to get home right away to see me. And then he said he felt like the luckiest man in the world.


We've spent every day together since and we've had a fabulous time and I've never felt better about my relationship and about myself. Ben has already asked if he'll get another picture anytime soon. I told him ""Only if you're good"" :)


tl;dr: Sent picture, discovered I now need to get a full wardrobe of sexy lingerie. I feel great!"

"I (31M) found out my wife (30F) has been getting a coworker (29F) to spy on me at work.


We have been married for 5 years and together for 8.

Not really great at writing, so apologies in advance. I'll try to include as much info as I think is relevant but please feel free to ask me for more in the comments if I wasn't clear about something.

My wife has been jealous of a coworker at my job for some time now. Her name is Heather and she's in her early 20s, tall, pretty. Just observations as I have a pair of eyes. Heather is nice but I don't go out of my way to talk to her. We worked together on a project about 8 months ago, which is when this seems to have started. Heather, 3 other coworkers, and I were assigned to this project and so for a good month we spent much time together at work. My wife saw her one day when we were all coming out and she was picking me up to go to dinner at my parents. She immediately asked who she was and if she worked at my job. I told her she was new and was put on our project. For the entire duration of the project my wife was in a bad mood almost every day and would take every opportunity to tear Heather down, saying she was lanky or her nose was crooked or whatever. She is insecure about her height because she's 5'4 and not a ""6 foot tall glamazon"". I love my wife's height and her petite figure and tell her this every day. She is extremely gorgeous and turns heads whenever we walk downtown. But once she saw Heather was tall and not ugly she was convinced I thought she was hot.  I kept telling her she was just a colleague and that I had no interest in her. Regardless, she would greet her coldly or not at all if she saw my colleagues. Our home and jobs are located downtown so we usually walk to meet up with each other after work. My wife would start dressing up a lot more than usual when she'd come meet me and make a big show of jumping on me and stuff. She works at a very nice bakery and usually brings leftovers from work for us or people at my job. She always gave things out to everyone except Heather. 

Eventually Heather picked up on the hostility and approached me to ask about why my wife was acting that way. I simply told her I didn't know, maybe because she didn't know her as long as the other colleagues she was distant. She seemed to accept that but would no longer leave at the same time as everyone else and would either go early or hang back.

Bryan, another coworker, approached me on Friday and asked to talk to me privately. He told me he had been at lunch with Kate, the coworker in question, and she had gone to pay for the food. She left her phone on the table. It lit up with a text and he saw it was from Valerie, my wife's name. The text basically said ""Did you see him talking to her today? What did he say?"" then ""Do you think Heather is going to stay at that job long?"" When Kate came back to the table he asked her if that was Valerie as in my wife. She got a deer in headlights look and said ""Oh yea..we text sometimes. We're friends."" He said he thought it was weird because she put her phone in her purse without even checking the messages he had asked about and wanted to go.

I went home and I snooped on my wife's phone. I know it was wrong but I had a feeling that if I asked her she would deny it or become defensive and not show me the phone. There were weeks worth of texts that basically were little reports on what went on at work. If Heather talked to me, what we talked about, did she hug me goodbye, did she touch me at all, did I laugh at her jokes. Did the guys think she was hot, did I join in with them, did I look like I was flirting..

Kate was also apparently talking up Valerie at work to Heather. She made sure to mention often we were married, how great Valerie was, how long we'd been together. I even read one that said ""I told her 'Val works in a bakery. I bet if anyone tried to steal her husband she'd just chop them up and bake them in to a pie, haha!' "" which was pretty fucking creepy. 

A lot of things started coming together then. Heather was much more distant lately, she seemed hesitant to say bye at the end of the day. We used to talk casually like everyone else at work but now she would just say hi and bye mostly.

I've been sitting on this information all weekend. Today at work I could hardly look at Heather for shame of it, and I couldn't look at Kate for my disgust. I haven't been able to approach my wife about this because I just don't know how or what to say. I feel frustrated and very much weirded out. I feel gross too like I've had my every move watched without knowing it and as if just talking to a coworker is doing something wrong. 

I haven't talked to anyone else about this, not even Bryan who first mentioned it. I don't know what to do from here. I don't even know what this means for our relationship. It feels like something big has changed because I haven't been able to look at her the same way and all my interactions with her since Friday have been kind of forced and faked. I need to talk to her and figure out what to do.

Any advice would be appreciated. I feel very lost right now.

TL;DR: My wife has felt insecure about another coworker because they are tall and attractive. She has been texting with another coworker of mine who gives her reports on my interactions with the coworker my wife is jealous over. I feel betrayed and a bit sick thinking of it. I don't know what this means for us or how to proceed.

**EDIT Thank you everyone who has responded to this thread thus far. I didn't expect this post to absolutely explode with some amazing advice, some harsh realizations, and great support. I've tried to respond to everything I could, and I have read every single comment that's been made so far. You guys are amazing! I think I've gotten everything I need from this thread, but I will continue to read and comment to anything new if I can. I can't say that there will be an update, but should I find out anything of worth I'll be sure to post that in the future. **

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I don't want this associated with my main account at all. 

Fair warning: this is a VERY long story. You need to know everything there is to know to better understand how shitty this situation is for me. 

Several years ago, when I was 21, I met this ""fantastic"" British boy on an online game. He was in the process of finalizing his divorce to his then wife. I was super respectful when I found out the details of his relationship, even though it was coming to an end. It wasn't until after they were officially divorced and they had moved on that we began talking a bit more seriously about there being an ""us"". 

After several months of video chatting, texting, e-mails at work, etc, we decided to meet up. I drove to Florida to meet him, and everything felt like a fairy tale from then on. I honestly believed he was everything to me. We moved in together after we started dating, and after a few months of living together he expressed wanting to go ""home"", which meant the UK. We worked things out financially, and we zipped off to England where we lived with his parents for a year. During that time, he proposed. I was over the moon. I said yes, and then we had to have a come to Jesus talk about our situation. In the end, we moved back to The U.S. to complete his permanent residency, while living with my parents since he couldn't work at the time. 

However, during all of this I was very blind to what was actually happening. In the beginning, his ex-wife had contacted me about how he cheated on her, etc. Being the typical girl in a new relationship high I figured she was just bitter and angry, and he perpetuated that lie with stories about how she was crazy. You know, the usual. During the course of our relationship there were a few red flags that he was quick to have stories for. ""Oh this girl I'm chatting with? Old friend! We're just catching up!"" Of course, this was a lie, among -many- others that I found out about after the fact. 

The biggest lie he told me was near the end of our relationship. I had a best friend named Cynthia, who he had gotten close to. Just a few days before my birthday he told me they were heading out to the mall to buy me a gift. You know, just a few hours, and then he'd be back. He didn't come home until 5 AM, when I was waking up to get ready for work. He claimed the car broke down on their way home from the mall, and that they had to call our mutual friend Kim to jump start the engine. Well, the mall closed at 10 PM, and when I spoke to Kim about it she said she met up with them just past 11 PM to help out, and that they were very drunk and touchy-feely, and they she felt awkward the entire time and asked why I wasn't there. She said they both claimed that they had asked me to hang out, but I said no. 

Lo and behold, on my birthday, neither of them had a gift for me. At that point, it was pretty obvious that something had happened, and with previous evidence I was finally done with his bullshit. I gave him back the ring and informed my parents that our relationship was over. Keep in mind, I confided in my mother a lot. Growing up, we were very close, and I always went to her when I had an issue or was frustrated. She knew about everything, and I mean everything. 

I told my mother that I was contacting his parents, and I was arranging to buy his plane ticket back home to the UK. With my own money. As I saw it, he had cheated on me, and it was time to have him move out so we both could move on with our lives. At this time, I was 22 nearing 23. 

WRONG. My mother, and my father, decided to put their feet down and told me that I brought him back to America, so we needed to sort shit out. They also refused to let him move into the guest bedroom. For the next 6 months, I lived in Hell. He was verbally and emotionally abusive, didn't respect ANY of my boundaries. I worked 6 AM - 4 PM, and he was constantly up until 4-5 AM on Skype with new girls and gaming buddies being loud as hell, etc. The list goes on and on. It was awful, just take my word for it. On top of it all, I was constantly arguing with my parents about it. They saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with what was happening, and that we needed to be adults and work it out. 

Nothing changed until I finally had a nervous breakdown and told them that if he didn't go, I would move out and take my $500 in rent and utilities elsewhere. They promptly agreed to let him move into the guest bedroom. 

However, he refused to move into the other bedroom! For the next week and a half I had to argue with him about moving his things. I finally got sick of it and moved his shit myself when he was out on a date with Cynthia. (We weren't friends anymore at this point, obviously). 

Once he moved into the guest bedroom, things were okay. I was able to lock myself away in my room when I wasn't at work, and I really just poured myself into my job and doing art on the side for additional income. It was a shitty situation to be in, but I was trying to make it work. Unfortunately, it only got worse. It became clear that my parents were choosing his side over mine. He said a lot of nasty things about me to them, and I got to hear about them through them in a ""I can't believe you did this!"" way. My mother started leaving me nasty written letters under my door, and whenever I would confront her she would say everything she'd written was true- because my ex-fiance had told her. I reminded her that all of this ""information"" she was getting was coming from the mouth of a lying cheater, and she was going to take his word over mine, her own daughter? Well, she did. 

When I had managed to save up enough money I peaced out and moved out without a damn word to anyone. I had a friend several states away who was kind enough to let me rent out their spare bedroom, and that's what I rocked for a solid year before I met my current boyfriend and moved in with him. I'm in a happy, solid place in my life, and I'm almost 27. 

My ex-fiance still lives with my parents. In the time after we broke up until I moved out he didn't have a job, and thus didn't pay rent or anything else. However, he did complete his permanent residency and is allowed to work. After I moved out, I didn't speak to my parents unless it was absolutely required. I called on Christmas, New Year's, Mother's day, etc. I didn't give my parents an address, either. I was fine with cutting all ties with my family since it was clear they were going to support my jackass of a lazy ex-fiance. 

So, that was just over 3 years ago. Yes, he still lives with them. Over time, my relationship with my mother got a bit better, but she's never apologized for what happened. That's okay. I don't expect one from her, but I won't make her a priority in my life. 

The other day, I got a random Facebook message from my ex-fiance's mother asking me to message him because he had a question for me. I was hesitant at first, but unblocked him on Facebook. I asked what was up, and he asked me about my TV and papasan chair. When we were living with my parents I bought both of these things, and when I moved out I left them behind because I didn't have room in my car, and I refused to make a second trip out of fear of dealing with him or my family. He said since he had been using them since I left, he just wanted to ask if he could take them, since he was moving out of my parent's house and into his own place. I said I didn't care. Honestly, I wasn't going to be getting those things back, and I really did not give two shits if he took them without my permission. That was the extent of our conversation. 

A few hours later, I get an angry phone call from my mother as to ""why in the hell would I give him permission to take the TV and chair"". I said, to be honest, I didn't give a damn. I hadn't seen either of those things in over three years, and I wasn't that god damned attached to them. If he was going to use them, so what? It's not like I was getting any use out of them. So then she went on a tirade about how he hasn't been paying rent since May, that he's knocked up Cynthia but left her for another girl (surprising), his room is an episode of hoarders gone wrong, etc. Also, while my mother was in the nursing home (she has failing health) and my dad was visiting he threw a huge party my uncle came home to. My uncle comes over to make sure the house is okay while my mother is in the hospital or the nursing home when she has really bad episodes. I spoke to him and he said it was close to 40-50 people who trashed the house, etc. The list goes on and on. 

My mother then told me I had to deal with my ex-fiance, since it was originally my idea to bring him around. Apparently, she and my father had been trying to get him out for months but he either wasn't listening or said he would move out by a certain date then never would. I told her to call the police and have him forcibly removed since it's their house and if they're kicking him out they can escort him out and watch as he takes his things. She said no, that wouldn't do, and that I needed to handle this situation. 

This is when I absolutely lost it. I reminded her of all of the bullshit I had to go through with him and her, and how, in the end, both she and my father supported him and his words over me. They paid for everything he needed such as close and cigarettes (and those aren't cheap!), catered to every need, yet if I was a day late on my rent (because I was waiting for payday) all hell would break loose. I reminded her that he had cheated on me, and when I made it clear our relationship was over they refused to let him move out of the house, much less my room until I finally snapped and threatened to move out. I reminded her every letter she slipped under my door, of every nasty insult she flung my way because he had lied to her, etc. I said no, she made her decision when she chose him over me, and she needed to stick to her guns and get him out of the house if that's what she truly wanted now.

It sucked getting that rude with my mother, but she had to know where I stood and the position she was trying to place me in. However, it's not as easy as that. My mother is very sick. She is constantly in and out of the hospital with heart/lung issues. She lives on an oxygen tank now, and any amount of stress can trigger a whole slew of issues. Her doctor's have warned her multiple times that stress can give her a stroke, etc. I've already lost my grandmother to a stroke, so I don't want my mother to go the same way. A part of me feels responsible for the situation, since I don't want my mother to have to put up with him. 

After my conversation with my mother, I sent my ex-fiance another message. I told him that after speaking to my mother I wasn't comfortable with him taking anything, including the TV or chair. I said those things were to remain where they are, and he is not allowed to take them. I said this was my first and last message to him regarding the issue, and to resolve this as peacefully as possible with my parents. They deserve that much. To be safe, I screenshotted the message and sent it to my mother, as well. I then blocked him on Facebook again. 

So, my question is, did I handle this the right way? I feel incredibly bad that I don't want to do anything more for my parents, but at the same time I also feel that they made their bed and have to lie in it now. If anyone else has gone through something similar, what would you do? Should I call the police for them? Should I make a visit? I'm at a loss since I feel like I've done enough, but not ""enough"", if that makes any sense whatsoever. :/ Any help or advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much. 

TL;DR: Met a guy when I younger, got engaged and moved in with my parents. After he clearly cheated on me they picked his side over mine, my life was hell. I moved away and he still lives with them over 3 years later, and now my mom's expecting me to deal with him since they're trying to kick him out.

"My [31F] Husband [33M] of 4 years doesn't take our roleplaying serious when we have sex! He purposely takes his characters way over the top!


So we've been with eachother for 6 years. Our sex life is just as good as when it started, I just wanted to try out some kinkier stuff so I suggested roleplaying. Kevin (husband) was somewhat open to the idea, but also thought it was a bit ridiculous. This is something I've always wanted to try, sort of like a fetish. So we got a few costumes, a Cop outfit and a Spy trenchcoat for him, and a nurse and cheerleader outfit for me. All of our roleplaying revolves around one person being in character, and the other interacting with them.

But he takes his roles as a joke! He goes intentionally extreme with the roles. I know he thinks it's a bit ridiculous, and I know he has more fun when he does this, but I want a real roleplay!

For example, when he dressed up as the Cop, he was supposed to do a stop and frisk, arrest me, etc, but in a sexy way. But instead, he kicks open the door, screams ""HANDS UP THIS IS A RAID"" and basically tackles me to the bed (this is OKAY it's NOT ABUSE we have rough dom/sub sex all the time), handcuffs me, literally reads me my Miranda Rights, leaves me there and rummages through the drawers throwing stuff everywhere, pulls out a little baggy of weed and goes apeshit like a cop might. I play a long, try to get him to 'let me go' if I can do sexual favours for him. Then we have some rough sex with handcuffs and everything. The actual sex was good but he kept speaking into his fake radio calling for backup, when I was on top he would shout OFFICER DOWN OFFICER DOWN.

With the Spy outfit he would come in and check me for wires and do the whole Pink Panther thing where he says ""It is lovely weather we are having"" while sneaking to the drapes and then beating the drapes up. I was envisioning a more James Bond-eqsue seduction.

Like, I like the sex, it's good, but I wanted a more porn-like experience. And it was kinda funny but not what I thought. And I KNOW that he thinks roleplay is ridiculous, and that he is trying to have fun with it but I feel like he doesn't know what I want. And I don't hate him for it, he's a big fuckin goofball in or out of our roles, but I want to have MY experience. How can I tell him this?

Edit: Well this got pretty popular! I appreciate all the advice and that y'all think my husband is funny. He IS funny, which is why I'm not totally cheesed over the situation. I'll try explaining to him more clearly what I want and then we can try to compromise. I don't think he's compensating or nervous, I think he's just trying to enjoy it the only way he knows how.

Sorry for the long post...try to bear with me


First off my father was Indian and my mother was white and they both met at coffee shop outside of each others buildings. He went by ""bobby"" and stayed with my mother for some before going to another country for a job and broke it off with my mom. My mom became pregnant with me so she tried to contact him but he never responded to her messages.


As a result my mom had to raise me alone... At least until she her current husband who I consider my own father. My mom told me the whole truth when i turned 16 but i really had no desire to look Bobby up.


I recently decided to look up Bobby after meeting my boyfriends family (also Indian) because honestly i felt jealous seeing how big and friendly his family was. (My mom raised me in her hometown so i never really got to understand my ""dads"" culture despite getting all the shit from other kids about it.)


My parents, while being honest with me, weren't exactly in support of building a relationship with Bobby as my mom still has some resentment towards him (as do i ofc) so i haven't told her i was searching for him - she is a great mom but a tad too emotional.
So some time after, I got some help from my friends and was able to find Bobby's family but found out that bobby has been dead for years (a car accident). I am pretty sure he was my biological father since his name and the info posted about him seem to match what my mom had told me.


But right now I am extremely confused about what to do. Bobby apparently had a huge extended family (a couple of siblings with a couple of kids each plus a pair of grandparents!) and I cant help but feel sorry for blaming him for not being there when he was clearly dead.


Do I contact his family and if yes, what do I say? I mean i have seen Indian families who are extremely welcoming but i was not raised in their culture and only started learning about it since dating my boyfriend. On the other hand Indian families can be very conservative (especially towards girls with boyfriends i dunno) (and i don't want to be known as the bastard white child of their son)...is it possible that they knew about my existence to begin with? Is it even worth building ties with them? How would I begin to even ask for DNA test or something like that...


What do i tell my mom and father? Would being direct be the best option? How do I get them to change their minds so they help seal this issue for me?


**TL;DR Bio father left before i was born, raised by my mom (I am half Indian but never experienced the Indian part) and recently found his extended family but also that my bio dad has been dead for my entire life. How do I go about dealing with this? Advice appreciated especially from first gen. Indians.**"

I met Vanessa when I was 15. It was just a random night out really. I didn't know her and she didn't know me. We both got drunk, made out with each other and stuck together for the rest of the night. It's silly when I look back on it now, but I was in love for the first time and I really thought this meant something. We exchanged numbers and for the next few months we went out on dates and slept together on a number of occasions.


Vanessa comes from an well-off family background. Not crazy kind of rich, but still significantly wealthy. I had no idea about any of this until the day when she called me and said she wanted to talk with me. Part of that talk was her disclosing this information, which overwhelmed me at the age of 15 because my own family was borderline middle-class at best and even my sisters and I worked part-time jobs whenever we could to help out.
 

The other part was that she was two weeks shy of being two months pregnant. How? Well, I mean, the usual way yeah, but we used protection, both on my end (condoms) and on hers (birth control pills). I was fucking terrified. Fifteen years old and my older girlfriend was pregnant and oh my God, her parents were going to kill me (if they got to me before mine did). This is basically what was running through my head. 


She said she wanted to keep the baby and in a way I was happy about it, despite the impact it would have on our lives. I mean, this surely meant we'd be together for years and years to come, right? Wrong. She didn't actually tell her parents about the pregnancy and instead kept it a secret (it helped that she already had a place of her own and didn't see them all that often) until it couldn't be kept a secret. They weren't happy about it. They were even more unhappy when they found who exactly was the father. It's not just that I was younger than her that they had a problem with (mind you, 14 is the age of consent here), it was also the fact that I basically came from a lower class background than them. Like I said, we weren't really poor, and we never lacked for food on our table, but luxuries also weren't really a thing for us unless my sisters or me earned extra money on side jobs for them.

By the time they found out, terminating the pregnancy wasn't an option, but our relationship did come to an end. Since she completely depended on her family's support, she had to choose: me or them. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was young and naive and in love. She chose them. That, I could understand, once I was a bit older. But it wasn't her parents who told her she had to give up the child. Vanessa did that all on her own. 


Basically, very soon after she gave birth, I was invited to come to their home and was then asked if I wanted custody over our daughter. If not, she would give her up for adoption. Her parents didn't even care, they wanted nothing to do with their granddaughter. I honestly can't understand how someone can be this cold and detached. It wasn't really a choice for me. I didn't care that I was just barely 16 at the time or that my family didn't really have all that much money to spare. This was my child. No way in hell would I give her up for adoption. Vanessa signed over all rights to me, arranged for child support to be provided over the years with her parents and that was that. 


I won't bore you with all the details of my life as a young single parent who still had school to finish. That's not important. Suffice to say, my family (close and extended) helped me out a great deal with it and I don't think I could have made it without them. A lot of them are still close to us to this day and their children are good friends with my daughter. Despite it all, we managed to have a decent, good life. 


Natalie (my daughter) is a child a parent could only hope for. She's kind and compassionate, the kind of person that everyone wants to be friends with, and she takes her education very seriously. Very, very rarely did I have to ground her or discipline her in some other way. What I think I love most of all about my daughter is that she talks to me. I know this sounds silly, but she comes to me and genuinely talks about any issues she might be having at the time. She opens herself up to me (to a certain degree) and I can't begin to describe how happy I am that my daughter trusts me so much. 


Three months ago, Vanessa contacted my family. Not my daughter or myself, but my parents and my sisters. My sisters - well, they're very protective of me and of their niece, so they had a few none too polite words to share with her once Vanessa told them she wanted to get in touch with me. She actually had some contact information already, but Natalie and me weren't in the country (summer vacation) so this was her only option at the time.


My family gave us some room to breathe once we got back before they told us about Vanessa contacting them.


Now, Natalie knows about my history with her mother because she asked me about it and I told her the truth. I mean, she obviously knew her mother wasn't there with us from a young age, but only two years ago did she ask me about the details behind everything. She surprised me how maturely she handled it by shrugging it off, saying ""Her loss,"" and moving on. When Vanessa did get in touch with me, she asked about Natalie and I told her that if she wanted to talk with her, she should ask her and not me, given that Natalie is of age where she can decide this on her own. 


Again, I have to say how much I love my daughter and how considerate she can be. Before meeting with her mother, she actually came to me to talk about it and if I was okay with it. To be honest, I have no opinion on the matter. If Natalie wants a relationship with her mother, she can build one, I have no reason to stand in the way of my daughter's happiness. Anyway, Natalie did end up meeting her mother, but in the past month, she started cutting down on the time she spent with her. When it looked like her mother was bothering her, I asked Natalie what was going on.


She told me she wasn't really feeling any sort of connection to her mother and that she agreed to meet her in the first place simply out of curiosity and nothing more. Natalie doesn't feel any kind of longing or need to have Vanessa in her life and told me that she can't really even think about her as a mother or a mother figure. That honor belonged to her aunts (my sisters) and she told them as much last Sunday, after a family lunch. Needless to say, my sisters were gushing and very emotional afterwards. Everyone was. It was a lovely day, all in all.


Sorry I dragged on about this so much, I just wanted you to know the basic background on things before I get to the issue in the title. 


But anyway, Vanessa. I think she's started to realize that she can't just have a close relationship with Natalie, not for now at least, and so she's laid off from asking her to come visit her so often. Who knows? Maybe Natalie will have form some kind of bond with her. Maybe she won't.


After this, it seems like she shifted her focus from Natalie to me. Granted, we did talk briefly when she first got in touch, nothing too much, just the basic kind of conversation, but I've no interest in what her life has been (or is) like, so long as it's not a disruption to my daughter's. Her parents are still alive, but they haven't bothered to get in touch with their granddaughter or me.  She's not married, never has been, though she was engaged to someone several years ago. 


Recently it feels like she's trying to gauge whether I consider her attractive. We meet occasionally, since she wants to learn about Natalie's childhood, see pictures of it and so on. Fine, I bring the stuff with me, but she always seems to want to sit too close or touch me casually or complain about some piece of clothing she's wearing, while drawing attention to her various body parts (cleavage, exposed legs, her neck). It feels like she's fishing for compliments, for me to say that she shouldn't worry, that she's attractive or that it looks good on her, but I'm simply not engaging.


It's getting to the point where even Natalie knows what's going on, as her mother asked her if I was involved with someone before. My dating life, in truth, is pretty much nonexistent. When I was younger, I had my daughter to take care of as best as I could. That meant she came before everything and everyone in my life. Did I still have sex? Well, yeah, here and there, but it was rare and ultimately couldn't lead to anywhere because there's not a whole lot of girls out there who'd actually date and seriously commit to a single father in their 20s. 


I suppose I could date if I wanted to now, but honestly? I don't feel a great need to do so. Life is good. 


Even if I did want to date though, I wouldn't get involved with Vanessa again.


However, I realize I can't be too harsh with her on this if my daughter decides in the future to pursue a stronger relationship with her, so I remain civil, if somewhat distant, with her. There isn't some kind of upcoming date where I expect this to be settled once and for all. I'm not in any rush nor do I expect to find a miraculous solution which makes Vanessa completely back off on that front, but I would like to know if there's something more I could do to negate or deny her interest in (dating) me, aside from just ignoring her attempts at getting closer to me.

  **tl;dr: A girl that I was involved with when I was a teenager ended up pregnant. She broke up with me because of her parents, before giving birth, gave up our daughter to me, legally, and hasn't been present in either of our lives for over 16 years. Now she's back and has attempted to bond with my daughter. It's not happening due to Natalie not seeing her as any kind of maternal figure and their relationship is just barely there. She's started expressing an interest in me and possibly us two having a relationship beyond what we currently have. What could I do to make it clear to her, without completely imploding my daughter's relationship with her in the process, that I am simply not interested and never will be in dating or being with her?**  "

"My fiancee [28F] has left me [29M] two weeks before our wedding.


I (29m) am absolutely heartbroken the way my fiancée (28f) has left me. For starters We had such a great relationship, we always put each other first and lived very happily in our little apartment. Just a very easy, loving relationship where we were both at one point so excited to be married and have kids. We met in college but didn't start dating until shortly after we graduated. After about three years I had saved up enough to buy her the ring she wanted and asked her to marry me in the Boston Commons. It was the best day of my life. We had booked our wedding about 6 months ago in Maine at a beautiful seaside location. It was supposed to be a small wedding, about 25 people, and then we were headed to Japan for our honeymoon a couple days after. A couple days ago we drove to Maine (were from Massachusetts) to get our marriage license and choose a spot for our rehearsal dinner. she seemed oddly quiet as my parents fawned over us, taking pictures of us signing the license and trying out different restaurants for the rehearsal dinner. The next day she came home from work very stoic and cold. We usually kiss and talk about our days the second we get home but instead she weirdly walked over to the couch and turned off the TV. She was breathing heavily and informed me that ""we need to talk"". My mind started racing about what I could have possibly done wrong. We have such a loving, open honest relationship that I thought it could be something trivial or maybe something horrible happened to her at work. ""I can't marry you because I don't love you anymore"".


To say I was stunned would be an understatement. She had to tell me about 5x because I simply couldn't believe what she said. Did I not hear her correctly? Is she kidding? Is this just a nightmare? WTF is going on?!?


I think I cycled through the first four stages of grief in about 2 minutes. Denial, anger, bargaining and depression, all in one horrific, blinding smear of emotions.


She apologized profusely and told me that she had fallen out of love with me a couple months ago. I couldn't belive it. I still can't. I'm horribly depressed thinking how the woman I loved so much and had so looked forward to starting a family with could shatter my whole world in such a fast, totally unexpected moment.

She left an hour later with a bag of clothes, bound for her sisters house. A couple miles away. She been there for two days now. 

Our families are both devastated by the news. Her sister is talking everything over with her to figure out what went wrong.


I know she never wanted a wedding. She has extreme social (""performance"") anxiety and she would always look to me for support and love whenever she felt that way. Her best friend and grandparents also said they would not be able to attend which I'm sure hurt her. I feel bad for not just eloping.


Her parents and grandparents are also divorced, she hates talking about their breakup which makes me wonder if she is terrified it could happen to her.


Or maybe she just doesn't love me anymore. Which is such a brutal thought for me thinking all the memories and love we've created the past few years.


I'm sick with grief and feel like I'll never recover. I'm also contemplating going to Japan by myself since I already booked everything. Just the thought of that is actually kind of funny in a dark, dark way. Like traveling around doing all these romantic things by myself. Though I am holding out hope she will join me. 


Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get over it? 


Thanks fellow Reddittors.

Hi Reddit, I'm sorry if this is minor and don't know if this is the right place. It's 6:50 am In Australia right now and I have not been able to sleep since 4 am. 

My niece is in the custody of my mother because my brother and his wife should have never be allowed to breed. They thought it was a good idea to have meth while their daughter was around. Various other problems and my niece lives with my mom, sisters and I. We are all in high school or secondary college as it's formally called here. 

My mom is a nurse and she usually works nights. My brother back when he used to visit his daughter, he has ran away to Perth with his wife. Have not heard from them in months. I am the only man in the house and this is the issue I currently face. My brother scared his daughter by hiding in her room with the most terrifying mask I have ever seen.  It was an old man that looked like he was scalping himself, ripping off the top layer of skin on his face. He got it off some hollywood effect mask sight so it was super realistic. 

It's just me she does this too, She comes into my room, climbs under my blankets and shakes me saying ""Uncle Roman"" again and again. At least 3 times every night. Shes scared the monster is in her room every night despite me checking numerous times. 

I sometimes can't get back to sleep and I don't know what to do

Just some surreal shit, I can't believe this is happening.

So my best friend and his fiancee have been together for close to fours years, and engaged for close to a year now. They've been planning their wedding for a few weeks now and are planning to marry next spring. I've known my best friend since my freshmen year of high school, we went to the same college and live in the same city and are basically brothers. His fiancee I'm also good friends with, and to make it clear, I've NEVER made any sort of move on her, nor have I ever thought of her as anything but a friend. I've also never felt that SHE thought of me in this way, so this entire situation is completely out of left field. Then again, I'm really bad on picking up on cues so maybe this is just me. 

Anyways, yesterday she texted me and asked if she could come over to my place and have a serious conversation. She came over, and we were just making small talk until she became quiet and then said in a small voice that she was in love with me. I just sat there in shock, and thought maybe she was just fucking with me or some shit, and asked if she was 100% serious. She said she was, and that she had felt this way for almost two years. She continued saying that we perfect for one another and that she wanted to break up with my best friend and get together with me. 

I stood there in complete shock, I didn't know what to say. It was one of the few times in my life where I was at a complete loss for words. Then, she sat closer to me and tried to lean in, but I backed away and told her to leave and give me some space. She said to please keep this quiet and not to tell my best friend, and left after that. She's called and texted me a few times, telling me that she wanted to meet up and talk and finish our conversation. I haven't responded. 

So I honestly don't know what to do now. Should I tell my best friend? I don't know, maybe he won't believe and she'll make up some bullshit to put the blame on me instead. Who knows what she's capable of? Fuck I honestly don't know how to proceed, any advice?

"Considering banning my (24F) roommate (22F) from using the guest room. Too harsh, or justified?


When I moved for a new job, I found a really nice three bedroom house for rent. It was a little too expensive for me, and I don't like living alone anyway, so I decided to sublet one of the rooms for 1/3 of the total rent. I kept the other two rooms for myself as a bedroom and an office/guest room. 

My last roommate had people stay in the guest room from time to time, which I was fine with because she always asked permission, cleaned up after them, and never caused me any problems. 

When my roommate of two months, Amy, asked if her parents could stay in the room last weekend, I was okay with it. What I didn't realize at first was that they planned to arrive Thursday night, and that Amy would take off work Friday to spend time with them. I stupidly agreed, but told her that I was working from home on Friday, and that her parents needed to be out of the room by 8. I didn't care if they stayed in the house, but I needed the office back. 

When Friday morning came, I found them still lounging around in their pajamas when I went to go to work. They gave me crap about being on vacation and not wanting to get up early. I told them I would take my laptop to the living room and give them half an hour. If they still wanted to sleep they would have to go to Amy's room. 

I come back later, and they are still in there. I politely ask them to leave, and they tell me it's not fair for me to control the whole house just because Amy is a subletter. I told them that had nothing to do with it, that I paid for this room and was letting them use it to be nice. They grumbled but finally left, and the whole time Amy was sitting right there and just let it all happen. They later tried to come back it without knocking while I was in a meeting, and were very upset to find that I had locked them out. I heard them talking about me later that night, like I'm the asshole in the situation, and Amy didn't correct them or do anything. After they left on Sunday, I told her I was mad at how her parents acted and she gave me a really half hearted apology and said sorry for her parents ""running late"" that day, like it was some crazy accident that couldn't be prevented. 

I'm considering not letting her use the guest room if she is going to let them trample all over my time and inconvenience me. But part of me wonders if it's too harsh for a one time incident. Her parents seem like jerks, but that doesn't mean everyone who would come to visit Amy is, so I don't know if I'm being petty.

Tldr: roommates parents overstayed their welcome in my office/guest room, and I'm considering not letting my roommate use it again."

***

Figured I'd write this for the people who asked for an update. Since writing my last post, I've been to one more dinner at my parents' house. I brought a family friend with me and asked her to keep an eye out for any funny behavior coming from Nick. I also hoped her presence would thwart any of his advances. I think a combination of my friend's presence and him being the one cooking that night made it so that he didn't talk to me much, which was great.

Of course, there was still a weird moment and it happened when I was grabbing wine from my parents' fridge in the garage. I had no idea Nick followed me so I yelped when he said something. My sister called from the kitchen to ask what happened and I said Nick scared me because he came out of nowhere. He said, ""There's a joke to be made about that."" I gave him a weird look and he said, ""Me coming out of nowhere."" Clearly a sexual thing. I ignored it and booked it out of the garage before he could do anything else, and for the rest of the night, that was it. My friend and I left early and I said goodbye to everyone from the door, pretending to be in a rush. 

Two days after that dinner, I woke up to way more Instagram notifications than I'm used to. I checked it and it was one brand new account tagging me in a bunch of sex joke memes or sexual pictures, a lot of them being women wearing wet T-shirts. There was also one of a woman in a S&amp;M-looking Catwoman outfit and I was tagged along with the words ""you in this."" Immediately suspected Nick. Didn't know how to approach it and it didn't tag me in anything beyond that burst of ten photos, so I didn't do anything about it. I told some friends, but wasn't sure what else I could really do.

Later that week, I got a Facebook friend request from someone I didn't know. I recently created a new ""for people I actually know"" Facebook profile (close friends and family I actually talk to and have seen recently). I don't get friend requests often anymore as I'm totally private and unsearchable, so this request was the only one that day and made me instantly suspicious. I thought it was some fake profile Nick made, but weirdly enough I looked into this guy's profile and saw that he was a real person with real friends and a job. He is Google-able. I checked to see his high school or college to see if he was a friend of Nick's and there was no schools listed, only current employment. Also, he lives in the Midwest, in a state where I know no one. Most everyone I know lives on the East Coast.

Anyway, I accepted the friend request and asked how this guy knew and found me, and the first thing I got back from him was a long and VERY explicit erotic story using my name as the main character. Considering how he messaged it to me right away, it was clearly written already and waiting for me. I took a screenshot, blocked him instantly and have since regretted it because I wish I could look at his profile and find his connection to Nick.

Honestly, I feel like there was no way this isn't all Nick. Even if that wasn't his FB profile, I feel like it's someone he knows and he put him up to this. He and I have never talked about wet T-shirts or Catwoman, but I also don't know anyone else who would be interested in sexually harassing me right now except for him.

So, yeah, that's my update. I honestly have no idea if I have a move here at all, since everything happened mostly anonymously on social media. I've asked around about the Facebook guy and even asked Gabrielle, but no one knows that name. I have made excuses to avoid future dinners at my parents' home and will continue to do so. I'll see them on my own, when Nick isn't around.

There hasn't been any online harassment since then, but I won't be surprised if another incident pops up sometime soon. Not sure how and where it'll happen, but I'm hoping it will include a slip-up that points me toward Nick because right now, I got nothing.

I made this update because I really want to thank everyone for their encouraging comments and PMs. It really means a lot to me and it's nice knowing that I'm far from the only person in this position.

And onto the update: I've deleted/deactivated all of my social media accounts so I can partly free myself from the negativity (relatives would sometimes write nasty passive aggressive or sarcastic comments on my posts). I've also decided to skip family get-togethers and holiday gatherings for the next several months or so. If they're still unsupportive in six months time I know they don't deserve to be a regular part of my life.

As for my parents: I had a long - and uncomfortable - talk with them. It turns out that my mom has been reading news and economic articles with a pessimistic outlook. Articles saying that economic growth is forever slowed, millennials will never reach the earning potential of previous generations, robotic/AI technology will replace all workers and render human labor obsolete, etc. She thinks that any attempt to improve myself is ultimately in vain (my dad doesn't have an opinion on the matter).

To be honest, I'm very worried about all of these things, especially AI technology, but there's really nothing I can do to stop it. All I can do is my best and improve my skill set in the mean time.

I've asked my mom to please keep her opinions to herself for the next few years. So far she has (since the conversation).

"My new neighbors [40'sM/F] have called emergency services at least 20 times in the last 2 months, usually in the middle of the night. I [20'sF]want tactfully want to ask if everything's alright without looking selfish.


Sorry in advance, I know how terrible this must sound.

I've lived in my apartment building for 3 years now with no issues. Most of the tenants are older or have families, so it's a pretty quiet building. About 2 months ago, a couple moved in right next to me. I introduced myself, they seemed really nice, no issues there. However, almost immediately, emergency services started getting called, and now at least 3 times a week I wake up in the middle of the night to hyper-bright flashing lights outside my window, and my dog barking at the EMT's and cops running up and down the stairs. The first week or so I was very concerned, there was obviously a big issue that wasn't getting resolved. However, it's still happening, and my concern has turned into irritation. Last night I woke up to my dog alerting me at 3am, looked outside and there were 2 cop cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance. It took almost a half hour for all the commotion to die down, and by then I was completely awake.

I feel bad bitching about someone having to call the police, but it's getting excessive, and my neighbors are also starting to get antsy about it. I'm wondering if there's anything I can politely say to ask if they're alright, and maybe subtly point out that everyone in the building wakes up when they call the cops.

tl;dr: New neighbors call emergency services at least 3 times a week, usually in the middle of the night, and the blaring lights and commotion wake everybody up. It's been 2 months and everybody's fed up with it.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great responses, I've decided to bring it up with my landlord and leave it be. The neighbors are very nice otherwise, and I definitely am not going to bring it up with them. I get little Christmas gifts for everyone in my building every year, so I'll give them my info then and tell them to let me know if they ever need anything. They don't bother anyone other than calling 911 a lot, so I don't forsee a problem with this. Cheers!"
"My [14M] dad is a CEO. It's impossible to get hold of him and mom and we need their permission for something


My sister and I are really starting to feel frustrated, It's actually impossible to get hold of our father and mother. Most if not all communication Monday-Saturday goes though assistants and security. 

They both travel for work and if not they are in their fancy building in Mid Manhattan. My father and mother are just so caught up in their business and dressing us up and dancing us in front of all their friends and playing happy family. We both hate each and every single one of their friends/their friends children who we are 'friends' with. (we come from a wealthy family)

My sister and I have this opportunity from out private school to go a college for the day. Our school has this obsession with keeping most of the kids that graduate from there going to college. So we get to go talk to people about scholarships and have a look around campus with a guide. We are freshmen but apparently it's part of some program. We need it signed and we can't get hold of him. We both just got home because school ended at 1 today. There is something going on with our school (it's private) but this is the only day it's happening. 

tl;dr:Can't get hold of parents/see them in person"
"My [33 M] boyfriend wants to see where I [26 F] live, but I don't want him to...it's driving him crazy. I don't ever plan to invite him over either.


Here's the situation:

My boyfriend has hinted very strongly that he wants to see my apartment. I live in a great location and as far as anyone else in my life knows, I live alone. It's a one bedroom apartment in a major city. 

He's a great guy and I've honestly never felt this close to another guy before, so it kills me a little that I'm not picking up on his hints to invite him over to my place.

I do have reasons.

My younger brother lives with me. No one else (except my parents) knows this. It was supposed to be temporary, but he's basically moved in with me - which I gladly welcomed. I told him to. He and our dad never got along. Lots of fighting. My dad was an alcoholic and my mom never dealt with the situation well. I always had to be this diplomatic figure in the family. It was terrible growing up. My brother is a great guy and I'm closer to him than anyone else in my family. He also has Aspergers and dyslexia so he's a little different and can act peculiar. 

No one in my life outside of my family knows about my family. They know I have both parents and a younger brother and I tell him I had a nice, normal childhood. Because I did, mostly.

My brother and I divided my one-bedroom apartment quite well. I converted the living room to a bedroom and the actual bedroom is his place. 

The set up of my apartment is a bit odd, for that reason.

I also like the privacy of my apartment with my brother. We keep our apartment in pristine condition. It's our ""safe"" place and I never bring guests over...I have no problem meeting friends till 2AM at bars across town. But at the end of the night, there is no crashing at my place (even though I have crashed at their places in the past).

It sounds weird to say oh, my brother lives with me. In my one bedroom apartment. 

I also realize I must be acting very weird for not inviting my boyfriend over. He must think I actually live with another guy...which I do (as you see), but it's complicated, or I have crazy neighbors. Or that I moonlight as a drug dealer. He's joked about all those options and I laugh and joke about it too.

But I know he's seriously curious. 

I don't know what to do...I have a perfect, perfect life outside of my immediate family. I've tried my entire life to keep my family life and life outside my family as separated as possible. All I want is for it to stay that way. 

What should I do?

  **tl;dr**: boyfriend wants to see apartment and I won't let him because I don't want to have to explain my dysfunctional family.

UPDATE: Every, single person here has so much common sense. We've only been seeing each other for about six months. Thanks for the great advice. I'll definitely work myself up to telling him the truth. You're all right...it shouldn't be a big deal. I'm not sure why I've built that mental barrier inside my mind, but I'll work on overcoming it!"

"My [26 M] current boyfriend [26 M] lied about my ex [25 M], leading me to break up with him


I've known Marcus for almost my entire life.  We were really really close friends, came out of the closet at the same time, and just generally got each other.  We both moved to NYC together after college.  We worked at the same firm, and decided living together would be a lot, so we lived in the same building. 

I met Dan about a year later, and we instantly hit it off.  I thought he was perfect.  Obviously, I wanted him and Marcus to hit it off.  Dan was super sweet during the interactions, but afterwards, always told me that Marcus didn't seem to like him.  

He would complain that Marcus wouldn't really speak to him when they ran into eachother.  He said there was petty things like Marcus refusing to tag in group pictures of us, or not following him back on social media.  

I asked Marcus about it, and he always explained he's not big into social media, and that Dan was overreacting. 

Dan bartended on the weekends to help pay off his student loans at a dive bar.  He has a LOT of regular, gay men come in who tip him very well.  Anyways, about 6 months into my relationship with Dan, Marcus and I went to grab coffee.  Dan was still asleep from working the night before.

Marcus was super uncomfortable, and told me that he had heard through the grapevine that Dan was cheating on me with one of his regulars after the bar closed.  I didn't want to believe it, but Marcus and I were so close, so I figured I had no reason not to. 

That night, Dan and I were hanging out on his couch, and I was trying to think of ways to bring it up.  Dan said he was going to bed, and I said that I wanted to stay up to watch some TV.  He left the room.  I was texting Marcus asking what I should do, and he suggested maybe going through Dan's phone for proof, so he couldn't delete anything after I brought up the accusation.  

I grabbed Dan's phone from the counter and there was nothing suspicious, but ten minutes later, he got a text from an unknown number:  it was about how much fun he had had the night before, and how hot dan's body was.  I played along and pretended to be Dan, and the guy knew so many details.  I was devastated.  

I left Dan a note explaining what happened.  I blocked his number, deleted him on social media, and left.  We haven't spoken since.  He came once to my apartment, but I refused to buzz him in. 

Marcus was amazing during this entire ordeal.  He supported me and really acted as an emotional crutch.  One night, about two months later, we were watching a movie together, drinking wine, and Marcus made a pass at me.  We connected really well that night, and about a month later, decided to start dating.  

We've been dating for about 4 months, and things were really great.  

Until this morning.  Marcus called me at work and asked if I could take a sick day.  He said he really needed to tell me something, and that it couldn't wait.  

We met at a restaurant near my work.  He told me the following: 

-he had made up that he heard that Dan was cheating on me
-he told me to check Dan's phone, and when he knew I was looking at it, texted me from a google voice number pretending to be Dan's fling, using details he knew from my locker room talk and his own visits to Dan's bar
-he had done this all because he's always had a huge crush on me

Reddit, I'm furious.  I have no idea what to do.  I haven't talked to Dan since leaving him, and I can't imagine how hurt and confused he is.  He literally did nothing wrong. 

How do I explain what happened?  I don't think I can ever talk to Marcus again.  Is there any way to fix this?

"This is a difficult question to ask because I (35m) may be the bad guy. But I am utterly not attracted to my wife (34f) of 10 years (19 years together) because of her weight and the attitude that got her there. Is it time to split the family?

"I [22M] kicked my roommate [23M] off our internet by changing the wireless password. Am I overreacting?


Over the course of several months, my roommate's debt has been piling up. All the bills are in my name, and he has accrued about $1300 total debt across the board for all of our bills. I have only seen $380 of it back.

At this point, I am livid. He has been using *MY* utilities for only 1/4 the cost of what he should normally be paying. 

Last month, I approached him with a feasible payment plan by calculating his overall income and breaking his debt down into reasonable weekly payments. He pretended to give a shit, but no action was taken.

Last week, I told him that I would start ""collecting"" every Friday, whether he liked it or not. I told him that there would be consequences if he didn't pay up. Friday came and went, and I didn't see any money from him. 

Tonight, I finally confronted him. I told him that I was very upset, and that he needs to start taking responsibility for paying me back. I hinted at consequences for not doing so, but I didn't explain what they were. He nodded his head and acted remorseful. At first, I really felt bad for approaching him that way. I'm not a mean person, and it felt unnatural to get angry at him like I did.

I went to the store, and when I came back, I heard him on his Xbox. He was confiding to his friends about how I got mad at him and hurt his feelings.

""Oh, poor you."" I thought. ""Poor fucking me, the person who's been paying all your bills...""

The more he laughed and laughed with his Xbox friends, the angrier I got. ""He's using *my* Internet for his personal therapy against my well-intentioned lecture...*fuck* *that*. He's not getting another damn second.""

So I booted up my computer, changed the router password, and listened to him mess with the router box in the living room. He asked me what was going on with the Internet, but I pretended to be asleep and ignored him.

By now, I think he definitely knows I changed the password. Am I being an asshole, or do you think I made the right decision? Should I tell him why I did it, and explain that I'll give him wireless access if he pays me consistently for a few weeks?

**TL;DR** Roommate owes me $1000, I lectured him about taking responsibility for his debt, heard him happily chatting with his Xbox friends after my lecture, and I promptly changed the wireless password in retaliation. Did I make the right decision, or am I being childish?"
