"[Update] Me [30 F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 1.5 years, I asked him to consider getting a job and now I feel like a demon


Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates.

[Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/)

So, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: ""How would you feel if I stopped working?"" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of ""If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?""

I wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead.

I've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day.

Wake up in the morning and he says ""...don't you have work today?"" and I'd be like ""Eh, I don't feel like it"".  The first few days he was like ""Awesome!"" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like ""So...what's up with work?"" and I tell him ""Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it"".  After the second week he says ""What's going on?!"" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to ""the machine"" either, so I'll just stay here with him.  

He FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks.

I kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah.

Anyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event.

I'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p

Anyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!


**tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again.

Edit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual ""reaction"", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a ""what's good for the goose..."" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was.

Basically...to this day he still believes he's ""right"", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really.

"Update: My [39 M] wife [30 F] of 6 years is upset I lost weight and wants me back to before


Link to old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qfpn2/my_39_m_wife_30_f_of_6_years_is_upset_i_lost/

Thank you everyone for your posts and advice. I really appreciate it! I made a few realizations about myself and my relationship to my wife. I wasn't easing my wife into getting into a healthy lifestyle and had completely forgot that when I started out, I took it very slow. It took me 4 years to get to where I am now, and my wife was trying to keep up with my current lifestyle, which can definitely be overwhelming. 

I was trying to look for the perfect opportunity to talk about this with my wife, and to ease the mood a little, I went and bought her favorite bottle of wine and a bouquet. I went to talk to her in our bedroom after our son had gone to sleep, and she had these old photo albums. Apparently she had stopped by her parents place after work to help them with some summer cleaning, and she wanted to keep the photo album to go through their memories. I gave her the flowers and opened the wine and we looked through the pictures while we were cuddling. 

We were leafing through the pictures, and then I saw one of a strikingly handsome man in a football uniform holding a girl that looked exactly like my wife when she was 24 kissing him. My wife was so interested in the picture, and she started tearing up a bit. I asked her what was wrong, and she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of her parents now. They're in their 60's, and still in love, but they have lost their shape that they had in their youth. Her dad had a really large beer gut, and her mom was overweight, but they were happy. 

She was saying that when we got married, she was hoping we would be like them. They never worried about losing faith in one another because their attractiveness faded as they grew older, but their love for one another continued to grow. She talked about her old boyfriend, who became so popular in college, and girls threw themselves at him, that he ended up straying; she was worried the same would happen to me because women in the neighborhood started to talk and say they wish their husbands worked on their bodies like I did. She was starting to feel really insecure.

Then I took that opportunity. I gave her a kiss, and then told her that she loved me when I was fat, and women like them never noticed me. She still loves me, but those women just lust. Sure, my eyes might dart, it is physically natural, but I loved her so much, valued our relationship so much, and only needed her in my bed, I couldn't even imagine laying with another woman besides her. She started crying tears of joy, and I didn't stop there. I pushed on wards. I grabbed the picture of her parents from college, the picture she had of her parents now, and a picture of when we started dating on my phone. I told her what her parents did, lose track of their health but still grow old and love each other is one way to live life. They got the chance to see their grand kids, but I know the health problems her parents have. Then I brought up my dad, and how he wasn't able to spend much time with his grandson, and how I want to have the opportunity to see my future grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids. I said I wanted her to be by my side. I took a picture of us now, and had the picture of her parents, and said, ""Why can't this be us when we're in our 40's, 50's, 60's, till we die?"" 

I told her I loved her, but because I loved her so much, I wanted her to become healthy. She doesn't need to get to her pre-baby weight, or anything drastic. I told her my story of how I just wanted to get fit, but then that developed into a desire to look good, too. She admitted that she also wanted to get back her health, and at the same time she was hoping to stick to her new years resolution to lose 20 lbs. We talked, set up a plan, so she is cutting the snacks down to two cookies a day and logging everything she eats, and portion control. That was when she brought up her monthly appointment with her psychiatrist. Apparently she had been going to talk about how she could get over her overeating habits. I felt so bad. I had neglected my wife when I was trying to become healthy, when I could have included her in my journey and it would have been so much easier to do together. We set up an exercise schedule every day, and she was joking how we should have sex every day to make sure we got our cardio in. I took the in, and we had sex the rest of the night. I haven't been as intimate with my wife like I was last night since our honeymoon. I hope to keep the momentum going tonight since we both took vacation for the long weekend ;)

I took the advice of being more intimate with my wife even outside the bedroom, and was kissing her and playing around with her while we were making breakfast today, when I hear a voice shout from upstairs ""DADDY! YOU SAID WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH GIRLS LIKE THAT!"" Ended up having the ""When a man and a woman are married, and love each other so much, it is ok to do that, because that is what leads to a baby"" conversation today. I can still see the shock in his eyes... but it had to happen so I can feel more comfortable kissing my wife and squeezing her butt in front of my son. 

I am so glad my wife does not have depression and that we were able to work together to put a plan to get back her health. She was showing me pictures of power couples, saying in a year or two she wants to take a picture like that together, so I am so glad she has that goal in mind. I also feel ashamed. When I was starting, it was to become healthy, but I liked the physical changes I saw in my body. Then for my model, I picked Leonidas from 300. But my wife, who has restarted on her fitness journey, printed out this picture of a husband and wife who are both fit. It just goes to show who loves who more, and I definitely need to work on that. 

Anyways, thank you so much for the support reddit. I really appreciate the help, and look forward to helping my wife with her journey, so that together we can live a long and wonderful life seeing our son grow older and his future kids. 



   
**tl;dr**: Got some wine, saw some pictures of healthy/fit couples, decided we can do it together. Starting a plan slow with moderate diet changes, 3x exercise a week, and lots more sex for cardio. Scarred my son for life because he knows that maybe girls don't have koodies because his role model is grabbing his mom's butt in front of him. "
"(Update) I(29M) broke my wife(28F)'s heart please help me save my marriage.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46vjbn/i29m_broke_my_wife28fs_heart_how_do_i_save_my/

I had forgotten about this post and I am back to update so maybe seeing my stupidity could prevent someone else from making the same mistakes.
 I cringe when I read today what I wrote months ago and it seems ridiculous to me that I could have felt this way about another woman. I wrote that I would imagine my former coworker while lying in bed but in the end when my wife stopped acknowledging my existence waking up without seeing her face was just absolute torture. I really took all I had for granted until I almost lost it

So I took some of the advices and decided to court my wife again the hardest I could. Of course the first step was looking for another job, and it took me a month but I managed to find a similar position in another entreprise. I did what was suggested of taking over every chore and she stopped ignoring me but would simply stare at me with some kind of hostility and go on with her life. I tried flowers but she would leave them to die. My wife dominant love language is physical but I wouldn't dare try touching her so I went for telling her. I somehow realized it was really the content of what I wrote about the other woman which obviously when you are deep in a crush is amplified, that really hurt her. I tried engaging her in conversations so we could talk about what was happening to us but more importantly what I did to her but she remained closed off. And so I started writing her letters and would leave them under her pillow.

 At first I apologized for everything, for writing the post, for not putting an end to the crush faster, for making her feel like another woman could hold a higher place of importance to me and for not taking the initiative to change jobs earlier. For making her life hard by creating this situation which ended in her sleeping in the guest room of her own house, for making her cry and causing stress to her. 

Then I wrote her love letters telling her how much I loved her, how the crush couldn't compare to the deep love I have for her. I was chewed for saying I loved her because of our history in my last post but I was misunderstood. I meant that the love I have for her has gotten stronger with time. 5 years ago I loved her, but wouldn't have given her one of my organs if she needed for example while now I would without hesitation. Our history is what caused the attachement to grow stronger therefore no random crush could override that. I was awed in front of my crush and wrote sappy things about her but in the end I do not know this woman on a personal level while I have seen the worst of my wife and the love remains. 

I told her how beautiful she was and how impressed and proud I was with her development as a person since we have met, how grateful I was for her presence in my life and every single thing I was thankful for that she did and enhanced my life, how much I needed her and missed hearing her tell me how her day went, laugh at my bad jokes and basically just missed hearing the sound of her voice. This is a small sample but it must have taken a good 3 weeks of daily letters until she answered me back.

She answered with a letter of her own telling me how much I have hurt her with my crush, how I made her feel invisible next to that woman, how I never told her such loving words (until the letters) how much she hated me but also how she loved me and missed me too. Her letter allowed me to feel her vulnerability. After reading it I cried and went to see her, we locked eyes,she cried and we held each other for a long time. She started talking to me again then and softened. Honestly the possibility of the marriage ending just like that scared the both us. 

As of today we are, to my surprise, mostly back to normal and actually I feel closer to her. We continue with the letters which have helped increasing our emotional intimacy. I make an effort to tell and show her my love. I am very grateful that she has given me a second chance and even more so that she has decided to put the crush behind us. We had maybe 2  fights since but she hasn't brought it up and doesn't punish me. It really wasn't the crush on itself but how I went about it and the lack of affection from my part in comparison.
 Maybe I am being optimistic here but I truly think we are going to get through this. We will be going to couple counselling after our vacation just to make sure things are really settled between us.





   
**tl;dr**: I managed to get my wife back after working on the way I conveyed love to her and we are doing alright."
"I (29f) caught my husband (38M) reading my diary. He admitted to having done so consistently the past three years. He has a binder of some of the pages photocopied. I am unsure of how to feel in this marriage.


Posting this in personal issues because so far it feels more like a personal issue to me. 

Yesterday afternoon I came home from work early because I wasn't feeling well. I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged. 

Eventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary. 

He said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me. 

My thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this. Writing in my diary was one of the only things I had left and now it's been taken from me. I've been so sad I can't even process it. 

I don't know reddit. Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I'm overreacting and I'm sure that's what you're thinking right now. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world. I used to have so many friends and hobbies and I feel like since getting married things have changed so much. My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive. 

I can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back. 

I just needed to vent I guess. If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Would you consider this a major breech of privacy or no big deal? Do you think I'm depressed ? :(

"UPDATE: I [24F] asked a cute lady [26F] out on a date, did I make it too ambiguous?


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4q17z1/i_24f_asked_a_cute_lady_26f_out_on_a_date_did_i/)

So, I told you about ""Fiona"", the cutie pie who goes to my church who I asked out on a date.  Almost all of you reassured me it was a date, which was good advice, because it totally was.

We had brunch together and then went for a walk near the waterfront of our city. We had great chemistry, talking up a storm, but we hadn't entirely gotten ""date-y"" yet, I really wanted to hold her hand but I was too nervous. Then the fairly nice weather turned into a torrential downpour, and she invited me back to her place. We got stuck in the rain, but luckily, she didn't live too far.

When we got back to her place, we were talking and I said ""By the way...I think you're really cute."" She said ""I think you are too...I'm just kind of anxious. I'm an anxious person."" We kind of looked at each other for a second and I said, ""So...do you wanna kiss?"" (I prefer to just ask these things.) 

She said yes, and that kiss turned into a full-on makeout session which turned into some really amazing sex. At one point I said to her, before we actually started having sex, ""I really want to do this but I'm always worried that if I sleep with someone on the first date, they'll get the impression that I'm only in it for the sex, which isn't the case."" She basically told me not to worry, because she wasn't getting that impression. And then we had some seriously awesome sex.

We're hanging out again Wednesday evening. I have this terrible tendency to get ten steps ahead of myself with these things, but we seem to have really amazing chemistry and I've really got a good feeling about this.
  
**tl;dr**: It was definitely a date. A date that went really, really well."

Hi everyone, so this more of a thank you more than anything. This is a really happy update. 

Our mother returned to Michigan yesterday and we informed her of the whole situation. We told her that Micheal (older/Vegas brother) had embarrassed Nick (little brother) on Facebook. We told her what was said and all about the situation. She gave Mike the biggest lecture of all time. She basically told him he can run around and get STI until he has them all, she can't control him. But he will not influence Nick to follow his poor example and endanger himself. She told him they teach safe sex for a reason and don't make condoms for shits and giggles. 

My sister and I went out and bought our brother some condoms. It was not as awkward as we thought it was going to be, but we had a conversation with us about them. We told him that we are proud of him and we told him girls would like him alot more for his actions. 

Super happy about this Dayna, the girl who he almost had sex with/his crush. Dayna asked him out on a date and they are going on a date tonight. So he is super happy about that and he is feeling good about his decision to stop. Nick is taking Dayna out on  date to the movies tonight so that's good. 

tl;dr: Mom gave older brother a lecture of a lifetime, got the younger bro some condoms. Brother is taking out the girl he almost had sex/ his crush on a date to the movies

"UPDATE: My boyfriend [30M] of three years has a problem with video games and I [27F] need guidance


[The original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lv9f8/my_boyfriend_30m_of_three_years_has_a_problem/)




So I want to quickly thank everyone who shared all of their personal gaming stories with me as well as some interesting debates as to what level of gaming is considered addiction. Also sweet shout out to whoever decided to pm me and say that this was all my fault for making my boyfriend want to escape reality and play video games so much. I hope Jesus finds you before Chuck Norris does... sorry my ""sick"" burns still derive from middle school. 




So on to the update. After submitting the post I read through a lot of material on how to quell gaming addictions and help me explain my boundaries without forcing an ultimatum on my SO. So a day after I went out and bought books from a second hand store. I tried to get two copies of each. I went on Groupon and signed up for a ton of couple courses (fitness, painting, anything). I also cleaned out our refrigerator of a lot of ready to eat meals/snacks and purchased a lot of food that requires some prep ranging from 5 minutes to 30.



When he got home that night I cleared off our kitchen table and asked him if he'd sit with me, no electronics. We had a pad of paper between us and I asked him if he'd write out how much time on average he spends on certain activities during the week/weekend. Work was 40-45 hours, carpool was about 8 hours, weekday gaming 36 hours (hour before work, at least two hours cumulated at work, hour on the way home from work, and average of five hours once home into the night), misc activities an hour (chores and household or grocery shopping). Weekend numbers for gaming were more or less the same fluctuating between 40-45 (saturday, sunday, monday). I asked him to count ""quality"" time between us for the week. As in minimal electronics, cooking together, coffee dates, hiking, dog walking, engaging conversation, sex... it totaled to roughly five hours a whole week, including weekends. 


I then asked him to rank important aspects of his life. They could be in a more important first manner, or just ""here are 10 things that are all equally important to me"". I was the third thing written. His family and security (financial, home, auto are all rolled into that) were the first he thought of, but I'm ok with that. I'd rank my family first too until we are together a lot longer or married. Our dog, traveling, learning, and health also made the list. 


I showed him the list vs. how he spends his time. 


So I asked him to compare the list of things he thought were important to how he spends his time. And that's when the tears started. He asked me if this was my way of saying the relationship was over, and I told him no, but I need attention too. Living with your SO seems like an easy way to spend quality time, and I suppose it can be, but it doesn't mean you should stop ""dating"".




I asked him if there was any reason his video gaming had been increasing as five months ago he didn't play this much. He said that it started as him being a little depressed about our finances, his job being so high strung, and not being able to go out as much wanted because of the finances (traveling, expensive sushi, what have you). He also felt pressure from some of his friends to play more as this was all they did. We talked about my gaming and how he would like for me to play more but recognizes that the fun is taken out of it if he begs me to play every day and is a majority of what he talks about.  In the end the gaming just became a weird solace for him. At first he used it to escape his financial fear, but later it just became a safe space that he was used to. He described it like going to your grandmas when you're upset with your parents only to really recognize how much you love being in her home and how she comforts you... So you try and visit her as much as possible, anything that can kind of trigger sadness and it's off to grandma's. They're out of my favorite kind of chips at the vending machine? Time to play video games real quick so I feel good. 




So we made a plan. I made it clear that I don't want to feel neglected in a relationship for any reason, that I like video gaming with him but I need more stimulation from him than quality time via coop mode. I brought out the books I bought and showed him the groupons I found and we reworked our weekly schedule so that during those free hours he has other activities to try that I'll be doing too. We didn't completely cut out his gaming time but we made set amounts per day. Carpool? Play all you want or read. At work? minimize it as much as possible by reading or working on work related activities so a promotion and raise are in sight to help quell financial freak out nerves. At home? Activities as much as possible with the promise that Sunday's we play video games together for around five hours schedule permitting. 






So far there's been one hiccup. Not major, he told me immediately that he overplayed and would be deleting his apps to get rid of the temptation. He's trying some therapy to help cope and though it's early I think he really is working hard to make things better. He cooks with me and a lot more in general, we play card games, we have our own read at your pace book club (we read a book a week at this point; onto book four soon), and through our activities stay as busy as possible. On our gaming days we make pizza together and make snacks and get ready to destroy on coop mode. He likes being able to do coop more than gaming alone and says that having a big day with him and I is makes not playing as much during the week worth it. 











I'm cautiously optimistic at this point. It's great that he's throwing himself so heavily into everything else, but moderation is still key. Thank you all very much again for help and ideas. 




   
**tl;dr**: So far things are looking up. We sat down and he recognized how much time during the week he spends on video games and we're working on cutting it down. He's been fairly good thus far. Thank you!"

"I [32M] asked my girlfriend [33F] of 12 years to marry me, and she said no, now she is being extremely distant and i am really confused


Me and my girlfriend have never fought, we get along fine. We have been living together for 9 years now, and have been dating for 12 years. We have a healthy sex life, we both have decent jobs that bring in decent money. In the past we talked about marriage a lot and would often joke about what our wedding would be like (yes i know how stupidly lame this sounds), however we always agreed we needed to settle down first. 

We bought a house about a year and a half ago, and were finally able to settle down. Our work schedules normalized, we were able to remove a huge waste of time from commuting, and we were finally able to take various activities after work (e.g. Dancing classes, cooking classes, etc). We were able to finally settle down. 

Finally we decided to take a week off and unplug on the week of 12 year anniversary. She wanted to go camping and hiking, and do the things we used to do when we were first dating. Unbeknownst to her i secretly decided to pick the exact same area where we met to do our hiking/camping trip. 

Two weeks ago as we are leaving she realizes where we are going and becomes ecstatic, and gushes about how romantic i am. More or less everything seems perfect. We do our hike, and we unpack, setup and by sundown everything feels perfect. So i decided to pop the question. 

This is where everything kind of falls apart, i ask her, and she just says ""no"". We literally went from ""i love you's"" to the single most akward silence i have ever had in my life in the time span of about a minute. We sat there kind of not saying anything before she says she is tired and goes to bed. She basically proceeds to cry her self to sleep while i sat there doing nothing. I basically didn't sleep and the next morning, she says she wants to go home. So we pack up and have a really awkward 3 hour hike back to our car. There were a few times where things kind of felt normal and we were joking around like we used to be for a bit. 

On the way back home, we are talking and chatting normally, but it just feels akward. At one point we stopped for coffee, and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened and all i got was a curt ""no"". This is followed by another extremely long silence for the rest of the drive home. We finally get home and i unpack everything while she goes off to bed she is going to bed.

Cue more crying, i tried really hard to talk to her but she pretty much told me that she just needs time to be alone and think. The next day she tells me she is going to take some time and see her family (which is literally on the other side of the country). 

It has been about two weeks since i dropped her off at the airport, she sent me a few messages to tell me she is fine, and that she needs some more time to think. Her best friend has been asking me every other day about what is going on with her, since she hasn't really been responding at all. I know she is okay though due to her posting some pictures of her and her family on Instagram. But it just feels really weird.

I am an absolute giant mess, i just don't quite understand what is going on. None of my friends have really offered me anything of value. I just feel if i didn't ask the question everything would be absolutely fine, and i don't really understand what is going on. 

I keep wanting to grab her laptop to try and figure out anything. I am not close to her parents at all, but i trust her and want to respect her space, but I don't know when she is coming back. I even sent her a message this morning and i know she saw the message and received it. But hasn't replied. 

Also her work has called me this morning asking about where she is. Apparently she had taken an extra week off last week, but she was supposed to be in yesterday.
   
**tl;dr**: Asked my girlfriend of 12 years to marry me, and she said no. Now everything feels like it is falling apart and i have no idea what to do. What should i do?

P.S. I am sorry if this comes off really rambly, i am just trash at writing, and have rewritten this half a dozen or so times. 

*EDIT* To clarify a few things.

The reason why it took so ong for us to get married, is we both agreeded we wouldn't move to the next step until we finished the following:

* We both finished school, for her that wasn't until 2 years ago
* We both had stable jobs
* We had a place where we could agree would be good enough to take stuff to the next step
* We both had decent working hours, for a long time she was doing her residency and we more or less worked opposite shifts.

We did talk about marriage, and kids and both agreeded it would be part of the next step after we got settled.

"Bf (25M) deleted a lot of my (23F) favorite photos because my ex was in them, doesn't think I should be as furious as I am


This story begins with my ex, Rick and I. My family and his family are friends and he and I have been close friends since we were children, we attended the same high school and dated from 2007 to 2014. Ultimately our relationship felt like it had run it's course and we split amicably, however having many, many similar friends due to attending the same high school and university, we saw each other quite often even after our break up. Because we share such a large and similar friend group, we have many photos together of not just us alone but with all our friends and even with family. Many of those photos are captured moments of treasured memories that make up a large part of my not so long life.

My bf, Adrian and I have been together for 14 months, we don't live together but I do visit him at his place and spend nights there. Anyway a couple months ago he borrowed my laptop to fix something for me, when I got it back, that was it, I'm not someone who combs my photos often, in fact the last time I did update the photos on my laptop must have been February. I randomly felt like going through them this past weekend though and found that there were a lot of photos missing, there are photos of my ex and I alone scattered here and there but most of them are friends/family photos with many people, which happened to include my ex.


I had probably 3500+ photos and I'm down to maybe 1300 now, over two thousand photos taken over many years, mostly by me are now gone. I understand this is partly my fault because not all the photos were backed up elsewhere, maybe 300 or 400 can be recovered, at best. Naturally I called him to ask what happened to my photos because he was the only other person to have the laptop within the last few months. He said that while fixing my laptop, he found a lot of those photos and was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those. I got pretty angry because those photos weren't just about my ex, they were about everyone over a decent chunk of my life and all the memories of fun events and even random mundane times in my life. Yes my ex is in a LOT of them but we've known each other forever and our families are very close, we'd been together for 1/3 of our lives when we broke up and still saw each other a lot after things ended so obviously he'd be in a lot of those photos. It's not like I saw him in a group photo of 11+ people and would start pining or anything. I told him if he didn't like it he should have approached me and discussed it, not acted without thinking and deleted my photos. Especially since the majority of 'couple' pics of my ex and I are gone. 


He says he understands why I'm angry and he did overreact when he deleted the photos but he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this and I do love him but I don't know how to just move past this. He says the photos are in the past and our relationship should be more valuable to me as it's in the 'here and now' as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago.

I should note that he and my ex do see each other from time to time, at family gatherings and I'm friends with his **(Rick's)** cousins and sisters and he's **(Rick)** friends with some of my guy cousins and when we **(Adrian and I)** do hang out in a group with my friends, sometimes my ex is there because well, yeah, we share many similar friends. It's not like we interact a lot or anything but he admitted that since we've been together he's always felt like a large portion of our friends and family don't really like him because they're very fond of my ex. So he's felt insecure for some time and acted without thinking. I told him that my family really likes him and my friends like him as well plus they have known my ex forever so it's natural they may have more affection for him but even so, if he felt that way, he should have discussed it with me.

TL;DR Bf deleted over 2000 photos because my ex was in a lot of them, these photos included friends, family and are from times that are some of my fondest memories, doesn't think I should be angry because our relationship is in the 'here and now' and that's the past"
"My [23F] son [2M] is dying. My mother [59F] is giving me hell and making this about her. I'm pretty emotional. Please help.


My son was diagnosed with a brain tumour about 3 months ago and since then doctors have tried everything to remove it. About three surgeries later, they tell me to take him home to make him more comfortable for the worse. He's been in and out of hospital about several times (throwing up bile,  dehydration and not being able to past stools properly.) Its emotional as it is. I haven't slept in what feels like years. 

He's dying. My son wakes up for about a few hours a day to drink and then falls back asleep. I have a new issue that's arrived. My own damn mother. My own mother who never wanted to see my son because she was too busy drinking and partying. She found out about his cancer and made it all about her. I've seen her Facebook posts. She writes that I'm trying to keep her away and that she loves her grandson dearly. She's tried calling CPS on me, tries to assault me when I get in my car to go home to shower and is always drunk. The nurses have been an amazing help but it's been emotionally draining. I literally have to sit down and watch my son die over the next few days and my own mother who has never asked how I'm doing keeps trying to pry back into our lives and make mine especially hard. Could I please have some insight from other stories and what I could do? I don't have many people.
I only have a boyfriend who's helped tremendously but even then, I don't like to ask him to do much. 

Also, his  dad is out of the story. He knows about everything but he said he wanted nothing to do with this. His mother said the same.

"[Update] Russian guy (33/M) who slept with ""mentally challenged"" American girl [31/f]


Hello All,

So, I posted here last week about a girl I met and had a one night stand with.  Shortly after this happened I started thinking about her a lot and wanting to see her again.  I didn't have any of her contact info.  I didn't even know her last name.  All I knew was where she lived.  So I went to the bar where I met her and asked the people who work there if they know her and if she comes in there a lot.  

They knew her.  She does go in there a lot according to them.  But they also both told me she's ""the R word.""  And this wasn't just them joking around.  I mean, they meant it.  The guy who served us that night even questioned why I couldn't tell, and told me if he would have known I was going home with her he would have stopped me.  Afterwords I felt really disgusted with myself and was even worried about getting in trouble with the law.  Because a mentally challenged person can't consent.  

Here is the original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qbrem/me_33_m_had_a_one_night_stand_with_a_girl_people/

So, I decided to hell with them.  I followed the advice I got on this sub and another forum I posted on.  (And I just want to say, people on this sub were amazing.  You guys really helped me see the situation for what it was.)  

So anyway...  to the actual update.  I went to her house and left a note with my number and told her I want to see her again and to call if she is interested.  And if not, no hard feelings.  

Well, she didn't call, but she did text me on Thursday afternoon.  She told me she hopes it's ok that she texted instead of calling, and that she hates talking on the phone.  (I am mentioning this because someone told me it might be an indicator of Autism.)  And sorry to trail off a little here... but the night we met and had a one nighter she wouldn't let me kiss her on the mouth.  And from what I read some people with Autism are standoffish like that when it comes to physical affection and stuff.  

So, I will stop going off on tangents.  We decided to go out on a date Saturday night.  We met at the same bar where they told me she was ""the R word"".  Meeting there was her suggestion.  But I ended up taking her to this Japanese place here in town, because she loves Sushi.  We went back to her place and I stayed there with her until about an hour ago.  

I am not sure how many details to give... but we had a good weekend together.  On Saturday night when we got back to her place we watched a few movies and had a few drinks.  And yes, if anyone wonders, there was carnal knowledge. (Quite a few times over the weekend, lol.) 

And then yesterday a few of her friends dropped by.  Nobody had to work today because it's the 4th of July, so there was pretty much an impromptu party at her place last night.  They didn't know she had company but it was fine.  I got to meet a lot of her friends.  They seem like good people.  Apparently her house is the hangout house in her circle of friends.  

Today we went out and did a few things.  I would have stayed with her longer, but I have to be at work really early tomorrow and have to get to bed early tonight.  We are already talking about going out again this weekend.  I can't really see her during the week because of conflicting work schedules.  (She works at night, I work during the day.)  But we both have weekends off.)

As far as her mental condition... screw it.  I don't see anything wrong with her.  She may be Autistic, but obviously it doesn't affect her life all that much.  

So, to everyone who wanted an update, there it is.  I want to thank everyone again fro all the encouragement and for all the positivity.  It's been a long time since I've felt like this.  
This could really be a good thing.  Her and I are really clicking.  

**tl;dr**: Had a one night stand with a girl people think is mentally challenged.  She isn't, and I spent the whole weekend with her.  

EDIT:  I did not post this thread to argue about Autism.  I also don't claim to be an expert on it.  The ideas I expressed in this post were not meant to offend anyone, sorry if I did.  And I am not narrow minded enough to think that just because someone doesn't like to kiss on the mouth or talk on the phone that they are Autistic.  I was just saying those are things that COULD BE linked to Autism.  "
"My [38F] son [7M] has various food allergies and his friends mom [40sF] doesn't take them seriously.


My son Simon has a lot of food allergies that we discovered when he was very young. The main ones are gluten, eggs, cocoa or chocolate, citrus fruits, and shellfish. None of the allergies are deadly, but eating these foods makes him very sick. For example, gluten makes him dizzy, he vomits, and he gets headaches, and touching an orange with his bare hands makes his skin itch and swell. Despite these allergies, my son is very friendly, outgoing, and happy, and he is not a picky eater, he will eat pretty much anything he isn't allergic to.

I know not everybody is used to dealing with these types of allergies, so I try to be very accommodating. I pack his school lunches and send a box of gluten free brownies to the school every month or so in case a kid has a birthday and brings in a treat my son can't eat. I usually ask his friends' parents if they can sleep over at our house so they don't have to deal with his allergies, but if he does stay over another house I pack him his own food and give the parents a list of things he can't have. I offer to give the parents of his friends bunches of bananas and bags of cut carrots for when he comes over, but most of them say it is no problem and they just keep a few in the house in case he comes over. My son is very good at spotting whole foods he can and can't eat (like he knows he can have blueberries, but he can't eat lemonaid), but I still like to give a list in case the family bakes or cooks something with one of his off limits foods in it. Every family so far has been really kind and accomodating.

My son makes new friends all the time and he recently became friends with a new boy at his school. They have become very close very quickly. They wanted to have a sleep over a few weeks ago and I contacted the other mother and asked if Simon and his friend could stay at our house. I explained that it makes things easier because of the food allergies. The other mother said she would not be okay with that because there is no man in my house (I'm divorced) and she wants her son safe. I live in a very safe gated community, but I know some people are very protective of their kids. So I sent Simon over with a safe cookie for a snack and some cereal and almond milk for the morning. The next morning, the mother dropped them off and told me that she was unhappy about Simon eating his own food. She said she thought he should bring enough for everyone. I told her out right that most kids who are used to eating regular cookies don't like gluten free cookies because they taste different, and they're also very expensive so I couldn't buy a whole box every weekend. But I said okay.

The next weekend, Simon stayed over there again with a few other boys for a little Fourth of July party. I sent a whole box of cookies, more cereal with almond milk, and a big bag of safe oatmeal with instructions. The oatmeal is just certified gluten free oats with some brown sugar and nutritional powder, and you add the almond milk and stir slowly for maybe 5 minutes until it gets soft. I figured this way the mom could make them the same oatmeal if she wanted to be fair or she could use the cereal if she didn't want to cook. I picked Simon up the next day and he looked kind of sad. The mother kind of snidely told me she didn't appreciate having to cook for my son, I asked her what she meant, she talked about the oatmeal. Then her son came up and told me that he didn't like the cookies much, but he really loved the oatmeal, and he said thank you. (I don't know where this good is learning his good manners because it isn't his mother.)

In the car, Simon told me he was sad because the night before, the other mother had taken all of the boys on a surprise trip to McDonalds. He politely asked if he could stop at my house to get a sandwich that was safe for him to eat because we only live five minutes away. I guess his friend's mom snapped at him and said he needed to ""man up"" and find something on the menu he could eat. Simon was so embarassed that he sat there and ate nothing while his friends ate burgers and fries. I am not okay with shaming my son or with language like ""man up,"" so I called the other mother and asked her about the situation. She basically told me that she thought I was making up Simon's allergies to make him seem ""special,"" and anyway, ""It's not like he'll die from them."" I was kind of shocked, so I said that I think Simon needs to stay home this weekend. Now I'm not sure what to do.

As a background note, my husband and I divorced on good terms a few years back because we realized we wanted different things from life. My husband remarried and moved to a big city on the other side of the United States that is very diverse and has lots of restaurants and stores that cater to all kinds of people. My son visits his dad in the summer and never has a problem getting food there, also, he mostly plays with his stepsister when he's there, so he doesn't worry about going to other people's houses.

How do I stand my ground with this mother without pushing too far? Am I expecting too much? Can my son still be friends with this boy?

   
**tl;dr**: My son Simon has a lot of food allergies. I normally send him to sleepovers and school with safe food but his new friend's mother doesn't seem to think that's enough and is making it difficult for him when he stays over. How do I make sure Simon can have his new friend and be safe?

edit - I did not expect this post to get so many comments, thank you for the help and please don't be angry if I can't respond to you."

"I (23f) saw a facebook chat between my BF (23M) and his brother (27ishM) that was very cruel about my appearance. I just don't know what to do because it REALLY hurts.


I will try to make this is as short as possible. I'm taking summer courses and my laptop just broke. I asked my BF (Andy) to borrow his overnight so I could finish a paper. He gladly said yes. As I was procrastinating with reddit in one window the tab at the top started indicating that there was a new Facebook message. Not even realizing that actually Andy was logged into facebook I clicked on the tab, instantly realized that ooops this wasn't mine when I saw the message was from his brother. I didn't cut and paste but basically the message said ""Dude, where's horse teeth at? You're up late?!?"" (I have terrible teeth, yes, not a secret, so obviously this was about me). 

I did not answer but my curiosity got the better of me and I scrolled through their conversation. While there were lots of positive things Andy said about me (she's amazing, she's very fun, I would never cheat on her no matter what [brother was pitching pretty hard to have Andy hook up with a girl from his work], lots of compliments about my rock climbing), he also said called me things like ""NoBoobs McGee,""""Rat's nest hair"" and ""avocado nose."" He also went through a long conversation sort of at his brothers urging that I am far from the prettiest girl he's ever dated and sometimes he misses the dumb, big boobed types he dated in high school. 

Here's the thing, I know I'm not the best looking girl. I wish I was but I've come to terms with my appearance...well at least I thought I had until last night. But I REALLY love Andy. It's not like a first love, puppy dog thing either because I've had boyfriends and been in love before and this is very different. 

I don't know if I should or even could get over this...but I want to because nothing he said was untrue (I have no boobs, my nose is too big for my face and I spend all my spare time outside so my hair is a mess most of the time) and it was a private conversation I was never supposed to see. But it still hurts that Andy does not see me as even attractive compared to his other girlfriends. 

How do I approach this? Or even should I? I know he would feel horrible if he found I knew about this...I don't want that. But I feel like I need to clear the air somehow...should I?



   
**tl;dr**: I saw my BFs private Facebook conversation with his brother that included some very mean and negative things about my appearance. I'm not sure how to proceed. 

Edit: took most of the advice here and broke up with Andy. I can't even see strait I'm so broken hearted and crying so hard. He was very apologetic and said he didn't mean any of it but to the person who said ""can't unring a bell"" is what kept going through my head. I can't even begin to describe how sad I am rights now. I always kept my fair Distance from guys...keeping school, climbing (I'm a semi-pro outdoor sport climber) and my community garden as a comfortable pad between getting hurt too bad. But I am smitten with Andy, everything about me and my self protective side I turned off because my heart skips a beat when he's around me. I'm crushed, I'm broken over this. I know things will be better in time but Mein Gott...I'm sick right now."
"My [35 F] husband [35 M] of 11 years cheated in our home, while I was asleep; then it got worse.


I (35 F) have been married 11 years but we've been together 16. My husband has some health issues so he doesn't work or drive any more. His judgement is impaired and before all that, he was mentally ill. But he was faithful and loving. Things have been strained the last two years.



We're moving out of state. He tells me a high school friend on Facebook is terminally ill. A few days later, he asks to visit her with another friend I like. It is bad timing, Sunday night, as our child has school Monday morning and he walks him to school, but he swears he'll be able to do so.


Finally, I agree. I lost my best friend to cancer...I'm soft for it. He goes. Returns at 4am via uber with a story about the party devolving due to bad elements showing up. (It was an hour away)


I take my son to the Dr cause he's too tired. I notice a funny charge on my card. An uber ride for $36 or so after the one he took. The records show it was from near our house to an hour away. He swears he had no idea what happened. 


He's spending a lot of time on the phone, texting, Facebook. He's become his friends with this terminally ill girl. I'm worried what that well do to him when we move, if she gets worse. She's always getting herself into trouble. Stories of not eating, needing to be saved. I keep refusing. 


She needs a place to stay. I cave in, though I refuse to let her two friends stay. I tell my husband she has to come after my son's therapy session.  She comes hours beforehand. Thus begins two days of things I want to forget.


I was nice to her. I didn't know. But when I woke up after the second night and there was a bed laid out on the living room floor and my husband was in my son's bed with her? I woke him up. He claims she wanted comfort after a scary movie. I didn't believe him. I told him she needed to leave. 


He finally got her an expensive uber ride. She was supposed to go see her dr, but skipped out to a friend's house. 


Mind you, during the time she was here I was working and took my son to an important doctor appointment that my husband swore he would go to. I repeatedly told my husband I was uncomfortable and asked if they had an inappropriate relationship. 


That night I got him to admit they kissed. Ok...sure. He admitted she did something to him. Finally, I asked to see his phone if there was nothing to worry about. Well, text messages were relatively clean. Not so with Facebook. That's how I found out he didn't know her before their first meeting when he brought her back to our apartment while I was asleep with my son &amp; brought her back in after he went to school.  The things they said are burned in my brain. 


They were doing things in my apartment while my son watched cartoons and I was at work; or while we slept. I can't believe the nerve, the betrayal. He thought he could get away with it. He told her he loved her - after a few short weeks (which tells me something wrong there). 


I trashed everything I associate with her or them...blankets, his clothes, stuff she left... I have to live here. At least til the end if the month. When I think about it, I want to throw up and my chest hurts. I can't tell anyone. He took advantage of my son's disabilities and my blind spots.  (And he knew it based on reading the messages)


He is very insistent that the reason he did this is because he was seeking affection. First night it was revealed he was yelling right back at me over it. But I refuse to let him use that against me. Our issues before didn't warrant this treatment.


My instincts all told me, but I didn't listen. Now I'm paying the price. We move out of state in a couple weeks. Lease is signed. I can't afford it without him. I don't know what would happen with my son without him.


So my question is: can I move forward with him? Should I? I am his caretaker, though that may have led to some of our issues in the first place. 


How do you protect yourself after such a violation? How can I tell he's sorry for what he did, not sorry he got caught? 

   
**tl;dr**: Husband slept with other woman in our home while I was sleeping, at work and while son was there - as secret &amp; as house guest. How do I move forward? How can I tell if he's remorseful? "

"[UPDATE] Should I (28F) stay or should I go? Four years with fiance (36M)


So a little over a week ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o9ddh/should_i_28f_stay_or_should_i_go_four_years_with/ 
TLDR: My fiance was treating me like crap and I wasn't sure if it was just me or if the relationship was salvageable


I was super anxious, ready to be told it was all in my head like he had been telling me for years and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of people that validated my experience. The biggest eye opener for me was FeelingFascination's comment about codependency. I had only vaguely knew about the concept, and somehow always tied it to enabling your partner to be an addict, which I thought I was out of the woods for that with his coke habit being done. But I was very wrong and reading all the symptoms I was mindblown. There was an actual word for what I was experiencing.


I posted the post on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon I'd made up my mind to leave. By end of day Friday, the plan was set into motion.


My brother had booked a Uhaul and I'd booked Monday off from work, a really good friend and coworker happened to need a roommate and another coworker had just moved in with her boyfriend so she even had an extra bed for me. 


I'd planned a ninja move, all my friends came out of the woodwork to assist. I knew there was no value in having a conversation with him as nothing had ever been resolved from doing that and honestly I was scared of how we would take it, his temper has a short fuse. While he'd never been violent, I didn't know if I could take the verbal assault and the emotional abuse that would've occurred if I had to have stayed with him until I could move.


The moment I started telling people, I was shocked at the number who were totally on my side and had some sort of anecdote about how things had not seemed right. The truth of the matter was, I'd lied about my relationship to all my friends. They only saw the show, but many had felt something in their gut wasn't right but they didn't know what. When I finally made the decision, my best friend fully backed me.


I explained to her what was really happening all the things I'd kept from her about his behavior and it all pieced together. She could suddenly see how manipulative he was behind all his charm. The Sunday before the move we all had dinner together, she messaged me later that night aghast at how she had ignored the symptoms all along. That Sunday I had also kept track of all the times my decision was validated, every time he did something that made me hate myself or made me miserable, I sent her a thumbs up on facebook messenger, but the end of the day I had sent well over a two dozen.


On Monday when Jerry went to work, my brother showed up with the Uhaul. Shortly after so did my friends, we packed everything up, I divided anything we purchased together as fairly as possible, leaving him an itemized list. I left him a letter as well, I was going to talk to him later but I knew he probably wouldn't listen and I might not get my piece out, so I wanted to make sure there was no question about why I had left. I was neutral and firm, focusing on my feelings and why I needed to leave


I spoke with a lawyer that was supplied by my work to ensure the tenancy agreement was dealt with and I left him a check for my half of the rent for July so he had time to figure out what he wanted to do.


We had completely moved out by 3PM. My friends took the Uhaul to my new place and unpacked while I called up Jerry and told him what had happened. To my surprise he wasn't angry, he was shattered. He fed me every line he thought I wanted to hear, how tomorrow everything would be different, but I saw through it all now, I couldn't unsee the abuse he had put me through over the years. I remained calm and firm and when he was just repeating himself I told him I was hanging up. I told him I would block him on all fronts until the end of July, he could then reach out to me then if he wanted to talk still.


After I spoke with him and I went and saw his mom at her work. I explained what happened and watched her heart break. She completely understood, she said she had hoped he'd changed but it was clear he had not. She wished me the best of luck and told me to keep in touch.


The last week has been a whirlwind. Jerry has continually tried to reach me through different methods, even including sending texts from the office printer at work (he's the IT man). He sent $100+ arrangements of flowers (which I know he can't afford) to my work and repeatedly has reached out to my best friend in hopes of getting some info on me. He has had his mom contact me a couple times now to sort out other details.


He hasn't been going to work, but he is finally getting help for his depression. The few messages I have seen of his have all been clear baiting attempts of him saying exactly what he thinks I want to hear, but I see through it all now. I see how manipulative it is and it just proves that nothing has changed.


That all in mind, I've never been happier. I was expecting to be crushed, my other half forcefully removed from my life, I thought I would miss him, but I've been finding more and more that I do not at all.


All these behaviors I tailored around his happiness have become glaringly apparent, all the things I'd given up and just how bad he made me feel. I can't fathom how i had fallen so far, I had always been confident in who I was and getting what I deserved, but he'd worn me down to nothing. He'd made me believe I was unattractive, fat, gross, unintelligent and unworthy. That is not the case. I feel so free. 


Just an example of one of the things I noticed that I did because of him was eye contact. The Friday before I left him, I went for a drink with said friend from the first post, I told him I was planning to leave Jerry, friend (let's call him Matt), Matt told me it was the right thing to do and that he'd done the same thing at my age with his then girlfriend, he said a lot of people around the 30 mark go through something like this. He made me feel excited to be on my own again, but he also made a comment that threw me off. Matt said ""I get the feeling that you're not the kind to give a lot of eye contact"" I made a snarky comment about only to people that deserve it and we laughed it off.


Yesterday I was thinking about that comment, trying to pin down what had changed. I used to love giving eye contact, looking into people's eyes told you a lot about them, it used to be one of my favorite things. In highschool my friends and I would just look into each other's eyes and try and guess what each other was thinking. What had changed? And I realized that Jerry had caused me to devalue myself so much that, I didn't feel worthy looking into the eyes of other people, only my closest friends. I was astounded that I had been broken so much that something that been such a core of my human interactions had completely changed and I hadn't even realized it.


This last week alone has proven to me so apparently how unhappy I was. On Wednesday my coworkers all wanted to go have a couple drinks after work spontaneously, and I could go! I got to hang out with my friends and we chatted for hours and they actually cared about what I had to say and were fully engaged. They didn't get mad at me when I disagreed with them, they weren't just holding their breath waiting for me to stop talking. On Saturday I didn't feel like cooking, I had snacks instead, it was great, he would've lost his mind. 



I did the right thing, thank you Reddit for making that so clear to me


TLDR: left my codependent relationship, never have been happier

EDIT: Thank you everyone all your amazing and encouraging comments and PMs. You are all the best and we all deserve happiness and not to deal with this crap. All the love to you all &lt;3"

"UPDATE to my [18f] coworker [18f] is publically harassing me to take her shift so she can attend an event I've made plans to go to


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4qhv14/my_18f_coworker_18f_is_publically_harassing_me_to/

Hi everyone. Thanks for your advice, the message I got from this sub was a resounding ""SAY NO!"" and it gave me the resolve to buckle down and tell Dani I wouldn't cover for her. About an hour after I made my first post, I answered Dani's texts and told her She would have to work regardless. I didn't get a reply at all, which was weird, because in the past Dani had persistently replied with some sort of argument. 

Unfortunately the world decided to screw me over today. Let me just warn you guys, this is not a happy update and I am getting furious just typing this.  Eager as ever to get what she wanted, Dani apparently had another Girl Scout (the ""friend"" I texted to confirm the meeting) and her MOTHER call my manager and plead to let Dani come to the meeting. It was mandatory for their New York trip, Dani was in charge of so much planning, and the trip might be in jeopardy if Dani couldn't come! Bull. Shit. So Wednesday an hour before my shift my manager called and said that sadly she'd have to insist that I work until closing (8) as Dani had to leave at 6:15. Maybe I should've argued, but I didn't. I mentioned before that I work with kids, and the girl scout's younger step brother is one of our kids, so most likely my manager was afraid of losing their business. 

Work was miserable, I was fuming the entire time Dani was there and after she left and 7:30 grew closer I just got angrier. Nonetheless, I did my job. The kids are always sweet and that helped. Dani was of course chipper as can be! My manager must have either a) felt bad for me or b) seen how upset I was, because she let me leave 15 minutes early (7:45) I still missed most of my boyfriend's performance, I only got to see a song and a half and I wasn't allowed into my priority seating section because it was too late and They'd given the seat away. 

What makes me really fucking angry is that when I checked snapchat, Dani had posted a snap story at the event at 6:45, so the entire meeting must've been BS. I wish I could've seen that snap during work - I would've called her up and told her to come back and finish her shift since her ""meeting"" had ended! I also saw all of my coworkers and several of my other friends sitting with Dani. I took this really hard because I'd opened up to several of these ""friends"" about the whole situation and sitting with Dani felt like they were choosing her over me. 

So, that's the story. Call me dramatic, but I'm done with all those friends who told me to take Dani's shift and also those who sat with her. I don't even want to think about Dani. In all honesty I'm considering quitting because this was so ridiculous. The whole place is run really poorly - other than my manager, my only higher up is my boss who has made inappropriate advances to several workers, myself included. Regardless, I'm definitely going to avoid Dani from now on. 

TL;DR Dani had a GS adult call and persuade my manager into making me take her shift. I missed my bf 's performance, my friends supported Dani. Things sucked but I'll get over it. "
"Update: Me [33F] with my friend [32F] of 15 years, how do I kindly tell her we're never traveling together again?


Thought I'd come back with an update, since I always enjoy seeing how things turn out when visiting r/relationships. 


Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mtyhe/me_33f_with_my_friend_32f_of_15_years_how_do_i/


All the advice on the last post was read and appreciated. A lot of people said I should immediately cut this nightmare of a person out of my life. I mostly had at that point (ghosted, polite but not friendly on the fre rare occasions since the trip last year when our mutual friend group all got together), but was not completely cutting until after this was over so she wouldn't cause drama for people who didn't need it. 


What I did the day after the post was talk to Marge. She too acknowledged that Lisa is now a terrible person, but she's at a point where she'd like to remember the good times. There was a period when we were all close, and she wanted to try and recapture that, even briefly. She asked if I could please be there at the same time, since Lisa and another friend from our mutual group, let's call her Edna, would be in town around the same time. So, I agreed. This was about her comfort and happiness, not mine. 


I arranged my trip so I'd fly down to my cousin's airport, which is a bit away, stay there two days, then she'd drive me to Marge's. (That way, I at least wouldn't have to be on the same plane as Lisa there/back.) I ended up getting to Marge's on Wednesday morning and Edna arrived Wednesday afternoon. Edna, Marge, Marge's husband, Marge's sister, and I had a wonderful day and evening. 


Thursday morning, Lisa flew in. At first, she was calling for a ride from the airport. At the last second, because she didn't think to ask anyone before landing of course. Marge's husband had just left for work with his car, Marge was asleep, Marge's sister was running a quick errand for Marge with her car, and there's no car for me to use to get her. (Edna doesn't have a driver's license.) I didn't want to deal with her, so I left it to Edna. Apparently Lisa was too cheap for a taxi, but too ""afraid"" to use Uber, so she tried to guilt it. We both said no. She hung up on Edna. 


Marge's sister got back maybe 15 minutes later with two of Marge's prescriptions. Lisa called her while she was out, but she explained she needed to get the medicines back and be at the house in case Marge needed to be driven somewhere, so take a cab and she'd pay for it. 


Lisa got here. Marge's sister met her at the door, and went with her to pay for the cab. Edna and I were in the living room and waved/said hi while the two of them hugged hello. Lisa sneezed twice during this exchange, and said her allergies were really bad. Ok. I have allergies. It's summer. I understand. She and Marge's sister went to the cab and stuff. 


Now, I'm not exactly sure what happened in that span of going to the cab, paying the driver, and getting the bags, but apparently something happened to make Marge's sister realize Lisa was sick. Which, as anyone who knows is not what anyone with stage IV cancer NEEDS around them. 


There was yelling from Marge's sister, rightfully so, because a sick (maybe infectious) person just hugged someone who is one of the two primary caretakers for a very sick woman. Lisa was yelling because she paid for this trip in advance and this was probably her last time to see Marge.


Lisa acted as though she's going to walk into the house, and Edna and I both stood on the porch. We told her it WASN'T happening and Marge's sister said she needed to leave, stay in a hotel, and maybe if she's recovered before she has to fly back in a few days, she can come and see Marge. Lisa claimed she doesn't have money for a hotel, that we're being bitches, and was again being terrible. She said she wanted to see Marge and have her weigh in. We didn't let that happen and threatened to call Marge's husband if she doesn't immediately get a cab or Uber and leave. 


So, we pretty much left Lisa in the driveway. She's on her phone. Marge's sister asked us to bring her some hand sanitizer and her phone and stays outside.  


Marge's sister called Marge's husband to report what happened. Lisa's phone call wasn't to a cab company, but to wake up Marge and try and guilt her way in. Marge told her that she can't see her or let her stay with her when she's sick and possibly contagious. Marge also said she had to tell Lisa she wasn't paying for a hotel for her. 


At this point, Marge's sister was almost afraid to go back in the house. She's worried she could be contaminated, and after talking to Marge's hubby had texted to make arrangements to stay with one of Marge's husband's cousins for a few days as a precaution. Overkill? Maybe. But she's there every day caring for Marge, so better safe than sorry. We waited to be sure Lisa does get in a cab or Uber and went. (She did.) Marge's sister packed a bag while I got a cab to take me to a car rental place. 


So it turned into Edna and I visiting with Marge. Marge's sister ended up being okay. She's here all the time and deserved a three day breather anyway. 


Lisa tried texting Marge and her husband a few times. Marge's husband was handling all communications with her, so it's less stressful. Apparently she tried to say she was better over a text the day before her flight home, but wouldn't actually talk with him on the phone, so we all figured she was still unwell and knew speaking would reveal how stuffed up/scratchy her voice is.


I haven't heard from Lisa since. From what I've heard, Edna, Marge, and Marge's sister haven't either. Marge and her sister are both upset about the situation. It was a lovely trip, aside from this momentary drama though!


TL;DR: Old friend (now barely acquaintance) was terrible, selfish, and inconsiderate when we went to visiting another old friend with cancer. She wanted us to go visit together again. I did what our ill friend wanted. Nightmare old friend was still a nightmare, but didn't ruin the trip."
"Our [19F twins&amp; 21F] brother [14M] discovered out older brother [25M] body after he killed himself. Our parents are refusing to get him into therapy


**Our sorry for typo**

Hi Reddit, so this is a really touchy subject. 

My older brother Rick was a really good guy, he just made some really bad life choices. Rick got into drugs, gambling, and his life was going downhill fast no matter how much anyone tried to help him. He lived with our parents and one day our little brother Jack came home to Ricks body. He saw rick had shot himself in the bathroom and killed himself. 

Jack called 911, the police called our parents and they called us. We are all extremely sad and it hit Jack the hardest. He does not smile anymore, he has become extremely overly attached to us, to the point where he will stop us his sisters from leaving. He throws up when he sees ketchup/raw meat/blood/bones. The list goes on and we have to go back to college come the fall. We can't leave him here knowing he is in such a bad place. 

We live in the state of Ohio, so if anyone knows if there is anything legally we can do please let us know. 

We have all insisted they get him into therapy, and our parents don't want too. They think therapy is a waste of money and time. They think jack will get over this eventually. They had to move house because Jack refused to go back in there. 

tl;dr: Brother killed himself and little brother discovered the body. Parents are refusing to get him into therapy.  "
"I'm [16 F] living with my sister [26 F] and her husband [29 M], I'm doing all the housework and her husband doesn't like it and is threatening her with a divorce. Am I wrong to take him up on his offer to support me until I'm 18?


Sorry if the title isn't clear but I'm not really sure how I should how worded it.

I've been living with my sister [Lauren] and her husband [Frank] for about 2 years now, when our parents passed away they took me in with open arms which I was extremely grateful for. I know my sister and her husband made a huge sacrifice to their relationship taking me in. I was actually a bit surprised my sister wanted to take me in at all, she seemed overeager to bring me into their home. I only say this because previously, she wanted nothing to do with me.

I've been actively doing housework since the first week of moving in with them to pull my own weight to the best of my ability typically I rotate duties with my sister between wash dishes, vacuum, laundry, taking out the trash, paying their bills own online, etc. My sister is a stay-at-wife so I guess her job/duty is basically to keep the house running and everything like that.

About 4 months ago she had some friends visit from out of the country and stay with us for about 2 weeks, her best friend, her best friend's husband,  and two other people who I didn't know quite as well. During this time my sister asked me if I could pick up her half of the housework so she could spend time with her friends/guest. I had no issue covering for her so for those 2 weeks I did everything from paying bills, to grocery shopping to laundry and all the other stuff the house needed. She never mentioned this to Frank directly from what I can understand because after the first week he pulled me aside and asked me why I was doing so much around the house and what Lauren had been up to.

I explained to him that I was merely covering for her so that she could enjoy time with her friends and that I **did not** mind the bit of extra work and it was the least I could do for her since she seemed like she was having such a good time with her friends. Well, the two weeks past and her friends leave but my sister is still recovering from all the fun and partying that they did (Literally seemed like they drank every single night or went out) so I kept doing her half of the housework.

One day Frank comes home early around like 11am, and he sees that I'm currently folding their clothes in the living room. He goes in their room and sees my sister asleep in their bed still (She'd been sleeping pretty much to noon or later) since her friends visited and hadn't been doing much at all. Frank talks to me for a bit and I try to cover for Lauren telling him that she just hasn't been feeling well or anything like that but I can tell Frank is clearly quite upset and knows that Lauren has been doing nothing for the past couple weeks. 

I tell him I **do not** mind doing the chores and that if anything it's something to keep my busy during my down time in the summer. He tells me that he told her explicitly that she was not suppose to do this, apparently my sister told him when I first moved in that she was going to have me do chores while my sister pursued some type of crafting. 

Anyways Frank and Lauren have been fighting about it a lot, Lauren doesn't think Frank should mind that I'm doing all the housework, ""As long as it gets done who cares who does it. It's not your problem.""

Frank is basically saying that he didn't marry her and allow her to be a stay-at-home-wife so that she could be lazy and do nothing with herself. He wants her to do the house work because that is her job to do it and that if she doesn't want to do it then she's free to get herself a full-time job and then they'll both just split the chores. He thinks Lauren is pretty much using me and treating me poorly by making me do her work.

I'm trying to stay out of it because I feel like I'm at fault for this, I did inconvenience them and I know my presence probably affects my sister and their relationship greatly. I've tried talking to Lauren but she seems so stubborn that she doesn't care what I have to say and doesn't want anything to do with me. She seemed stressed or angry and I'm not really sure why, her and Frank have been talking about it a lot and I just try to mind my own business.

Last week Lauren and Frank both approached me at separate times, Lauren told me that she didn't know what was going to happen between her and Frank and that if they did divorce that she would be taking me with her and moving to some part of Europe to stay with her best friend who visited. Honestly I didn't want to do it and she said that at first we might have to live on our own just the two of us while arrangements were made to accommodate us.

Frank approached me and told me that I was a good kid and that he was truly sorry that I had to be in the middle of their martial issues. He said that he would try to keep things as civil as possible and that I had nothing to worry about. He offered to basically support me until I turned 18(?) and could access the money that my parents had left for me. He told me that I didn't have to go with Lauren should they happen to divorce (I guess he knew she would be leaving overseas?).

I feel guilty to even admit that I've been considering Frank's offer more than I should. I feel like I'm being such a bad person/sister because I know I owe my sister big time but she doesn't seem to really have herself to together right now. I fear that going with her pretty much means watching her crash and burn or me having to carry my weight and hers which is unrealistic at the moment and I don't want to move to Europe if it's possible.

I haven't mentioned it to my sister yet but I know she's going to think it's pure betrayal and likely hold it against me. But, am I really wrong for considering what Frank told me?

**TL;DR:** My sister and her husband might be getting divorced purely due to her laziness(Can't think of a better word). If they divorce she is moving to Europe to be with her best friend and wants me to come. Her husband has offered to support me until I turned 18 and could live on my own.

"Me [32 M] with my wife [31 F] of 5 years, could be getting divorced over an aquarium.


Throwaway account for personal reasons.


To start off, my wife and I have been together for 5 years, and things were going pretty great…until recent events. We met during speed dating and both quickly took a liking to each other. We both have great jobs and plan on having kids pretty soon, maybe within the next 2-3 years. Also, we don’t disagree on many things, and rarely argue (sometimes of course). 


So, my wife and I just bought a house in Florida, and she is crazy about anything aquatic. I’m talking whales, fish, lobsters, she just loves all things of the sea. One of the first things that she told me about herself on our first official date was that she “Loved the Seals”. I’m not quite sure what this was supposed to mean. Was it some type of save-the-seals slogan you might hear for pandas? Anyways, that didn’t really strike me as too odd since I am an animal lover myself. In our first apartment we had a quaint fish tank that housed around ten fish, but she always wanted more fish in that damn tank. I said, “Look, we can’t have any more fish in that tank! They need their space!”. She agreed, and the issue has not been brought up since, until now.


As I said above, we just recently bought a house in Florida. One of the most striking features that we love about it is the giant pool. It isn’t the greatest looking pool but it is definitely large. One of the first things she mentions AFTER we purchase the place is “how cool it would be to have our own aquarium”. I go on to tell her that it is not a wise idea for us to have an aquarium, for various reasons. It did not seem to make her extremely angry but I could tell that she was a bit annoyed and frustrated about the whole ordeal. A few days later she brings it up to me again, except this time she had a legitimate plan all written out. I’m was taken aback; she used Word to type up a detailed plan on how we could get this “aquarium” to work, bullet points n all. It went over the costs, the types of aquatic creatures we would house in the aquarium, what type of contractors and licenses we need to pull it off. The craziest part: she wants to use the POOL.


I told her that I thought it was really sweet that her love for aquatic creatures has given her the idea to have our own aquarium in our pool, but wasn’t willing to spend nearly $20,000 to do so, nor would I do it regardless of the cost. The most fucked up part is that she wants sharks in a separate pool that we would have to build. Why the hell would anyone want giant sharks in their backyard? She told me that this was one of her dreams ever since we had met, that we would own a pool and start up some type of backyard aquarium bullshit. Her first sign was apparently “You said you loved the seals too”. 


So now I am thinking in my head that I married somebody so that they could have a potential aquarium partner? She has now gone as far as saying that she will leave me if I don’t agree to this. I don’t even know what to do at this point… She claims that I am “crushing her dreams”. I am just so confused about all of this. We have been great for 5 going on 6 years and she wants to leave me because I won’t agree to having an aquarium and building a separate pool for sharks? 


Is it even wise to try and work this out anymore? I feel like I am being put into a corner right now and cannot do anything about it. She won’t even pick up my phone calls. Should I cave and build the aquarium? I need your help Reddit.





   
**tl;dr**: Wife is threatening to leave me if I don’t agree to building an aquarium in our backyard."
"Me [34M] with my GF and her daughter[37/9 F/F] my gf's daughter no longer wants to spend time with me alone in public b/c i'm not white.


This whole thing Sucks and i really have no idea what to do. My gf and i have been together for ~8 years. I love her and her daughter (who i consider my own) and honestly cant immagine my life without them. That said, things have gotten really tough with Milly (daughter) recently. 

For as long as we've been together, it has always been hard to be seen in public with Milly alone. She is blond, with blue eyes and clearly not biologically mine. I am a very dak skinned indian man and i wear a turban( im sikh)  Whenever we are in public alone together we get stopped and questioned, A LOT. For the last few years i've been stopped and questioned by the Police at least once a month with Milly. Its the same every time, they separate us, ask me bullshit questions and (now that she is old enough to speak her mind) grill Milly about me and how she knows me. When Milly was too young to understand things and express herself clearly there was an incident where I was Arrested after taking her into a family bathroom to change her diaper and Milly was placed into state care for several hours until the cops could reach her mom to sort things out. 

The justification they used then was the fact that Milly was really upset/crying when we came out of the bathroom and even after her mom sorted things out, she was  visited by a social worker for a few months. Nothing that bad has happened since milly started talking but the questioning by police hasnt stopped. It has gotten to the point where Milly now actively avoids going out in public with me alone and has asked her mom if she can hire a white nanny to pick her up from camp/drop her off this summer so that I wont have to. I honestly dont know what to do. I know that milly loves me and that she still wants to spend time with me, but i dont know how i should respond to her request. 

To me Milly is my daughter. I've been around since she was a baby amd have been active in raising her. I know that she is still too young to understand things but i cant help but feel terrible about her request. Since she asked last night i havent been able to sleep. I dont want her to grow up hating the fact that i look different. I dont want her to be afraid of going out with me. I dont really know what advice I need, anything is helpful. I just dont know what to do. 

Tl;dr**: my girlfriends daughter who i consider my own has asked if we can get a white nanny to take her out in public so she wont have to be out alone with me. Idk what to do "

"Boyfriend (M27) doesn't seem to think new roommate (M26) should pay rent UPDATE


[Click here if you want to read the first post.](https://redd.it/3zf31r)


Oh boy. A lot happened after that last post. Boyfriend started acting very ... strange. T moved in, was written onto our lease, and things were okay for a couple of days. He paid rent and helped cook and clean. T kept inviting girls over, but whatever. They didn't disrespect us, didn't make a lot of noise and mostly stayed in his room. I also told T and Boyfriend that I am moving as soon as possible.


Incident one: I was sitting on the couch next to him and got a message from a friend with a funny gif of a a cat. I smiled when I saw it. Boyfriend immediately asked who I was talking to, why was I smiling, and then demanded to know when I was moving out. 


Incident two: Boyfriend asked me who ""Christian"" is, and added that he saw that this ""Christian"" said I didn't text him back quick enough - I don't know anyone by the name of Christian and told him as much. He refused to believe that I don't know anyone with that name.


Incident three: we watched a documentary about Ukranian revolution in 2014. Afterwards I googled to find out more about the man that was stripped naked by the police and the consequences of this. Boyfriend, however, insisted that those weren't police but regular people. He got huffy, said that I *always* have to be right, and told me that I am an idiot.

Incident four: we (Boyfriend, T and I) were at a birthday party for a mutual friend. As I was nursing my beer the others were playing a game of ""I have never ..."" and ""I have never sent nudes"" came up. Boyfriend sneered under his breath that he wish I would send nudes to him instead of random dudes. I have never sent nudes to anyone. My mood was ruined, so I got my jacket, bid the host farewell and went home. Boyfriend got home later, went ""I think we should take a break"" which I countered with ""I'm too old for that bullshit"" and that was it. We broke up - or so I thought. The next day Boyfriend insisted that he thought we had patched things up. Nope.


This all happened over the course of a month. Then it happened. I found an apartment. Nice location, a bit small, but rent was reasonable and I liked it. Of course I took it. I told Boyfriend, and he panicked. ""I didn't think you'd move"", ""please stay here"", ""I don't know what to do without you!"", but what's done is done. I wanted out. 


As soon as T found out that I really was moving out, he went ""I'm out"" and moved too. I guess their friendship wasn't as strong as Boyfriend had thought it to be. 

And so I started packing my belongings. I asked around and found a few people willing to help me move, all of them big strong men because I am but a small woman with little strength in my upper body. I got myself removed from the lease and paid the deposit and first month of rent for the new place. After the moving was done we had pizza. It was great.


However ... Boyfriend soon found out that, nope, he couldn't pay the rent himself. He demanded that I helped him pay until he found another place. I said no, I have no obligation to do that and that I have been nice to him for far too long. He got pissy and unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse. I blocked his number. I am happy and care free and he can go fuck himself.




TL;DR - We are never ever getting back together. "
"Me [26M] with my ""friend"" [26F] who was interested in me but I wasn't in her


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pgvev/my26m_friend26f_with_autism_has_been_displaying/


So shit hit the fan this weekend. The Friday after I posted one of my friends (one of the same who has been asking me if I'm interested in Yasmine) texted me and said we were all gonna meet up at Chili's later. I said I'd be there, and lo and behold when I show up it's just Yasmine at a booth alone.


They fucking set me up on a surprise date.


I had no idea what to do, I was ready to walk out but I figured this  is probably gonna have to be the time to set her straight. And if shit hits the fan at max speed I can at least get some big mouth bites to go. So I go over and sit with her, and she thanks me for agreeing to go on a date with her. I take this chance to tell her my feelings as gently but firm as possible. I took a lot pf peoples' advice and said as a rule I don't date within my friend group, and that I think that we are too different to be a healthy couple. I also told her I didn't like being tricked into a date and that I felt very disrespected.


I would love to say that she understood what I was saying and where I was coming from. But like I feared she lost it. How could I lead her on and I'm just some man whore who likes to tease women. She also said that nueros like me have know idea how hard it is trying to date when you're autistic and how if she wasn't burdened by this I'd probably have taken her to bed already. She then got up and threw my drink in my face. I wish I was kidding (or had gotten water instead of tea). The entire restaurant was staring and I left without any food.


I get back home and after a while my phone starts buzzing periodically with everyone in our shared group of friends texting me asking what the hell happened or berating me for breaking her heart. Todd(roommate) came in and showed me his phone asking why was Yasmine texting him this. She sent him a text saying that I had been horribly rude and sexist on a date that night and basically told her I'm not dating you because you're autistic and asked him to give me a piece of his mind about it. 


So my worst fear came true and she was turning my entire friend group against me. I even got some texts from unknown numbers saying what a terrible person I was. However one of the unknown texters texted me ""Hey am_i_anass, so I'll make this quick. Yasmines my sister and she texted me tonight saying that you broke her heart and Gave me your number to harass you. I'm not gonna do that"". So I texted him back and it turned into a long conversation about how when Yasmine was diagnosed her parents immediately started giving her special treatment and she just turned into this raving bitch because of it. So she wasn't faking like a lot of people said but she was entitled. Her brother was such a nice guy and he really gave me a good pep talk about standing my ground. Keep in mind this all happened Friday night.

So Saturday rolls around and me and Todd are talking in the living room about what to do next. He said he backed me 100% and if we had to be the two amigos again he was ready to cut out our friend group. I go through all the messages from my friends again and thankfully not everyone was accusatory towards me but no one besides Todd and Yasmine's brother was really on my side. I ended up sending a massive group text to everyone besides Yasmine and the unknown numbers(who were blocked instantly) giving my side of the story and kinda telling them off for instantly jumping on the band wagon against me(like I said not everyone was mad but no one else came to my defense) and not thinking about what kind of person I am before condemning me. And that by just assuming I should've dated Yasmine to appease/pity her then they were the ones treating her differently because of her illness and not me. 

It's currently Monday morning and so far a couple people have texted/called me and said they agreed with me and apologized to me. None of the girls have and I'm going no contact with everyone else until they apologize. I' not going to speak to Yasmine or the female friend who set me up on the date again. 


**tl;dr**: Set up on a surprise date. Shit hit the fan with Yasmine. Friends are picking sides and luckily not everyone is choosing Yasmine."

"My [25F] boyfriend [26M] serenaded his co-worker


We've been together for 2 years and we live together. We had people over for the 4th and he invited some of his friends from work. One of the friends is a girl who is obviously very pretty and everyone loves her because she's a fun person to be around. We all had a lot to drink and my boyfriend and one of our friends were playing guitar and I was sitting in the pool with some of the other people. My boyfriend starts playing this song, and I wish I remembered what it was, but it was basically about how hot this girl is and how he wants to fuck her but she's too high maintenance for him. And he was singing it right to his coworker and replaced whatever the name of the girl in the song's was with her name. He was like leaning over her and she was staring up at him completely loving it. After it was done my friends were like ""holy shit are you okay with that?"" But obviously I wasn't going to do anything right then. 


After we got out of the pool my boyfriend and the girl and a couple other people got in. I looked over and she was sitting on his shoulders with her legs wrapped around his neck, and I also saw her doing the thing that you would do with a kid where you hold them on your lap and they push off your legs and you throw them (hope that makes sense). Honestly the whole night made me uncomfortable and all of my friends were blown away by how they were blatantly flirting in front of me. 


I brought it up with him yesterday and he said they're just friends and were just having fun and that I'm overreacting.  I worry about how they are together at work if that's how they behave in front of me. Does it sound wildly inappropriate to anyone else or am I overreacting? They don't get together outside of work often and when they do its in a big group so I don't want to ask him to stop seeing her but is there some sort of compromise we could reach? It seemed like he was only a couple of beers away from cheating on me. 


**tl;dr**: my boyfriend and his coworker seem to be way too flirty but I don't know how to get it to stop. "

"My [23F] father and brother [61M&amp;29M] reduced our brothers [24M] fiancee [24F] to tears for being a former cam model. My mother expects me to play peacemaker


My brothers fiancee is absolutely draw dropping gorgeous, you can tell she is head over heels for my brother. She always has this big smile on her face when he is around and he treats her well. He would never hit her, never yells at her, they are a perfectly healthy couple that met in college. 

Her English is kinda broken because she comes from the Ukraine, she moved to America when she was 19 with her mom. As the story goes she was forced to be a cam model by her ex abusive boyfriend. He would beat the crap out of her if she did not basically show herself naked on cam to other men. He got arrested for distributing meth and she met my brother not long after that. 

Unfortunately someone put videos of her up on pornhub and xhamster. My brother found them and showed them to our father. The very short version of events is we had a 4th of July party.  They basically asked her a whole bunch of humiliating questions when my brother was away talking to me and some friends. They shoved a video of her in her face with his phone.
'
She ran to my brother and she looked really upset and she started to cry. My brother went into the house and basically all hell broke loose. He ripped my father and brother a new one and he told them both to fuck off. They left and they worse part of it was they were going to tell everyone they are expecting their first child. 

She is several weeks pregnant and they were going to tell everyone while friends and family were gathered in one place. 
My mother expects me to play peacemaker between the family. She wants me to get them talking again and I don't know how too. I think I should leave it alone

"My Friend(31F) had a very Disturbing Wedding Ceremony, should I say something?


I’ve known my best friend “Laney” since we were both eight years old.   We shared everything together, we were closer than sisters, her parents used to call me their third daughter, etc.    We’ve inevitably grown apart somewhat as adults, especially as I moved to a different city a few years ago, but we still talk on the phone and we hang out when I come back to visit my parents every few months.  

Laney got married two days ago.  This is her second wedding, she married her high school boyfriend first and had two kids with him but divorced him before the second was born because he’d become an alcoholic and drug addict.   From what she and everyone else had said, her new husband ""Shane"" seems like a great guy and everyone was really happy to see Laney get with him after what she went through with the ex.  He’s sober, hardworking (both Laney and Shane have the same job in the medical profession) loves Laney and is wonderful with the kids, they both just light up when he comes into a room.  

Shane proposed after they’d been dating about a year and a half.  Laney would have been just as happy to elope since she’d done it all before, but this is Shane’s first wedding and he and his family wanted a  big one, so that’s what they did.   

 They used Shane’s family minister.  

The minister opened with the quote about Eve being made from Adam’s rib as a helpmate for him, and then the ENTIRE ten-minute speech he gave was about women submitting to and obeying their husbands.  It was gross.  He even mentioned Laney having resistance to the idea during pre-martial counselling, he said they had “discussed it many times” and made it sound like he had talked her around to it.  He said something like “A lot of women have a problem with the vow to ‘obey’ because it is sometimes used to justify things that God wouldn’t approve of.  They are afraid to follow.  But you show them a godly man who they trust, who is following God’s plan to be a worthy leader in their lives, and I haven’t yet met a woman who would object to letting that man lead them”.   

That was paraphrasing since I don’t remember his exact words, but the whole mini-sermon was like that, just his ramblings on what submit and obey meant, and how the man as the provider and leader has “sacrificial love” for his family.  


 I think Laney’s dad was upset by it, because when the minister finally asked him “Who gives this woman?” he answered in a very loud voice, “Her MOTHER and I do.”    It sounded like a subtle fuck-you.  Afterwards I asked my husband if I was alone in thinking that was disturbing and he said “No, it was like she joined a fucking cult, it was that bad.”   We fist-bumped and reconfirmed that we were equal partners.    Laney’s sister came up to me during the reception, more than a little tipsy, and went on a rant about it.  Her brother joined us and agreed.  They had known Shane’s family was evangelical Christian, but hadn’t been expecting anything like this.  The only previous hint was the speech Shane’s father gave at the rehearsal dinner, when he mentioned being the head of his family and said that he knew Shane would be a great ""leader"" for Laney and her kids.  


Now I’m both disappointed in and worried about my friend.  I hate that she thinks of herself as a second-class citizen in her own home.  I can’t believe she took those vows in front of her daughter.  I wish she hadn’t set that example in front of my kids- I wouldn’t have brought them if I’d known.  A lot of people were speculating that Shane doesn’t believe this bullcrap, that he only went with it to placate his family.   But if he does it seems to point to a lot of scary thought processes.  

Laney is away on her honeymoon, how should I bring this up with her when she returns?  Or should I at all?  Her family is very low-drama and non-confrontational, I don’t know if anyone will say anything besides me.  Are my instincts even right on this?  I have a history of awkwardness, maybe I should just let it be?  If I should talk to her, how do I do it without upsetting her?


TL;DR:  My friend had a sexist and disturbing wedding ceremony, I am worried, should I say something to her?"
"My[26F] Dad[58M] wants me to apologize to his girlfriend's children [29M, 27F] for pointing out their racist comments about my own race.


Bare with me, I’ll try my very best to keep this as short as possible.

My parents split when I was 23 and my sister was 20.  They were such a poor match and I’m surprised they lasted so long, and both of us breathed a bit of a sigh of relief when they split.  Everyone was immediately happier, and since then, both of our parents have found new partners.  

I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad, albeit a bit of a strained one.  My dad is a fair bit less politically correct than I am (and I am hardly PC at all, trust me).  He calls things that are stupid or that he doesn’t like ‘gay’, he uses the word fag to describe gay people, thinks Hillary Clinton would be a bad president because ‘she’d nuke everyone on her period’ and laments that he can’t use the N word in public.  He’s the epitome of out-of-touch late 50’s lily-white guy, is what I’m saying.  I love my dad, and while these things bother me, there’s literally no changing him, so I have to just bare it when I’m hanging out with him.  And, an important note is that while my dad says some sexist, homophobic shit, he NEVER does so in public.  At the very least, he knows when to keep his opinions to himself and his family.

Recently, my dad’s been seeing this woman, let’s call her Iris.  Iris has two kids as well, 29M and 27F.  I don’t really know Iris very well, I ‘met’ her earlier this year at my dad’s place but only very briefly as I was dropping off a few things with my dad.  My sister’s never met her before, and neither of us has met her kids before.  My dad really likes this woman, so he wants all of us, both sets of kids to get to know each other and the parents so we can all ‘be a blended family’ (despite my dad’s political incorrectness he can be adorable sometimes)

So Dad invited us all out to dinner.  My sister’s known to be a bit bristly with strangers so I told her to be on her best behavior, because I want our dad to be happy and I didn’t want to offend Iris or her kids.  So we sit down and all start trying to get to know each other.

My Dad chose a Mexican restaurant to take us out to, because it’s our whole family’s favorite type of restaurant.  My mom is Mexican, and growing up we had the most bomb-ass authentic Mexican food all the time.  Since my mom and dad split, my dad has been trying to fill the hole my mom’s great cooking left in his belly, so to speak, and is a taqueria-junkie!  Also important to note; me and my sister, despite being half Mexican, have really white skin.  We have obviously Mexican features (or at least I think they’re obviously Mexican) but everyone always assumes we are of white European descent because of the color of our skin.

So we sit down with Iris and her kids, and immediately her kids start complaining.  These are grown ass adults complaining that half of the menu is in Spanish.  Next to each thing on the menu was the Spanish name and the English name, and all the descriptions were in English, so it wasn’t like an English speaker couldn’t read it!!  I am near fluent in Spanish and my sister speaks passably, and we’re both in school to become English-Second-Language teachers, but we tried to settle the hair on the backs of our necks and ignore them.  We actually manage to have a pleasant convo with them otherwise, until the waiter comes over to get our drink orders.

Iris’ son snapped at the waiter like a dog to get his attention and take his order first, and her daughter spoke in a highly condescending voice, very slowly, like this man working at a restaurant that caters to big fat white people couldn’t understand damn English!  Iris was normal, thank god, but when the waiter (bless his jolly soul he was so kind despite being treated like an idiot by those two) left, her son remarked that he didn’t expect the service to be very good, “I don’t even know if he could understand us.”  My Dad has been to this place before so he said “no, the service here is great, you’re going to love this food, I recommend (I can’t remember what exactly he recommended)!” trying to smooth things over, and then the son says “not like I could understand him either with that god awful accent!  These people need to learn English if they want to come to America!  Probably an illegal or some shit.”

Me and my sister are generally nice, kind people, but no one has ever accused us of being patient or suffering fools silently.  So, because we’re petty, we just gave each other a look and started speaking only in Spanish to one another for the rest of the night.  I felt bad, because Iris looked mortified, but it felt so good to be so petty for the next hour or so through dinner.  We of course switched to English to talk to Iris or her kids, but with each other and my Dad, who can understand it but not speak it, we spoke the most rapid fluent Spanish we could muster.  And at every opportunity my sister would try to mention that we were Mexicans and had grown up in a Hispanic household with our mom and her extended family.  

Since then, my Dad’s been texting and calling us (mostly me because I’m usually the ringleader of these sorts of things) begging for us to apologize to Iris’ kids for embarrassing them.  For embarrassing them!!  I’m sure my Dad didn’t know they were going to be so racist towards Mexicans (or else I’m sure he wouldn’t have invited them to go out for Mexican food) but I know he doesn’t even think what they said was that racist.  He’s said that ‘they could have been worse’ and ‘there was no need for you to humiliate them and Iris like that!’  I agree, Iris was lovely, I should have taken her feelings into account, and I have no problem calling or meeting her to apologize for acting so petty and childish, but damn it, I do not want to apologize to racists for pointing out and not taking their racism sitting down!  Is that so wrong?

What should I do?  Am I just being petty about this too?  I don’t want to make my Dad unhappy but I know he’s not a good judge of what is and isn’t racism, and I don’t feel like I should apologize for slapping a couple of racist adult-brats down.

TL;DR – Dad’s new girlfriend’s kids were racist against Mexicans, didn’t know sister and I are half Mexican, sister and I spoke nothing but Spanish to each other for the night to embarrass them, Dad now wants us(me) to apologize to them for embarrassing them.  What do?

"Me [24 F] with my husband [25M] of 1.5 years just hit me for the first time.




Second Mini Update: Talked with husband some more, his attitude shifted. He went from saying he will never drink again to ""I'll stop if you really want me to."" He also went from thinking it was something stupid he did to saying it was my fault for provoking him. I brought up going to therapy but he doesn't want to go because he says there's nothing wrong with him. I brought up the time he grabbed my throat when we were dating. He starting yelling at me saying he didn't put his hands on me. I somewhat stupidly walked him through that incident and what happened and his response was: well it doesn't count because I was just angry and drunk and lost control, I didn't set out to hurt you. This is when I realized it really is time to leave.





Please forgive any errors. This is my first post and I'm a little hysterical at the moment to be honest. 

First, I want to set the stage for what happened tonight. Back in December my parents told my husband and I that they would pay for us to go and stay at a nice hotel at the beach for our Christmas present. This is the week we choose to go so I have been excitedly awaiting this trip for months! The past few days have been amazing and we were particularly impressed with how nice the resort is and really blown away by my parents generosity.

Things turned bad earlier today when my husband told me he wanted to drink. I was hesitant because he doesn't always know his limits and I end up babysitting him sometimes. However, he persuaded me to the point that I purchased the alcohol and even had a few shots myself even though I'm not a big drinker. At first we were both having a great time drinking and playing in the ocean. Then he finished the bottle and started doing some really embarrassing things. Soon after it got dark and I suggested we go back to the room. He liked that idea and ran there leaving me to gather, carry and clean our cooler, beach back and floats. I was pretty irritated at this point. When I get to the room I find him waiting in the hallway completely covered in sand with a huge pile around him. I tell him he needs to get in the shower as soon as we go in so he doesn't make more of a mess. He agrees, however gets out shortly after still covered in sand and jumps right into bed. I tell him to get back in the shower and he tells me to fuck off but eventually goes in anyway and locks the door. About twenty minutes go by and the water is still running. I yell into him to turn the water off and go to bed. He complies and crawls out miraculously still covered in sand and now also vomit. He proceeds to vomit again on the carpet. I tell him he needs to get back in the tub and that I will help clean him. He says ""fuck off bitch"" and tries to push me show can get to bed. I stand my ground and tell him shower first.

I want to pause and point out that I would not normally stand up for myself like this but I was really worried about my parents getting a fine for the room being left a mess. That fear was making me brave and a little bit bossy. 

He keeps trying to push me to no avail and finally hits me hard on my arm. I'm shocked but still brace myself in an attempt to lead him to the shower one last time. At this point he grabs me trigger around the throat with both hands and slams me onto the floor. I gave up then and he fell asleep immediately.

What I want to know is was he out of line for doing that? If yes what do I do? How likely is this to happen again?

tl;dr: Husband drunkenly puts his hands on me after I bother him about washing off before bed. Is he out of line?



Mini Update: Husband woke up and is currently in the shower. When he first woke up and asked why I was on the floor I told him about everything he did the night before. Initially his reaction was shock and he started to cry but got over it in a few seconds and said I must have been imaging everything because he did not get that drunk. I had him check the bathroom for vomit then he believed me. He apologized and said he will never drink again as some of you predicted. However, he doesn't seem to really think it's a big deal and has an attitude of ""there I go with my drunken shenanigans again, lol, what can you do?""

If I hadn't posted here I probably would have brushed it off too. I'm so thankful for all the support I've gotten from y'all. I'm going to try to make it through the next couple of days with out doing much. I don't have any friends of my own and my mom has health issues so I don't want to worry her too much until I can actually be there with her.

"My [39 M] wife [30 F] of 6 years is upset I lost weight and wants me back to before


Throwaway. Wife follows me on Reddit...

I got married to my wife 6 years ago when she got pregnant. Ideally, we would have dated for longer than 9 months, but it is what it is, and we had our son soon after. Within the few years of our marriage, life was good. I got to learn a lot more about my wife and we got along really well, much more than when we were dating. Then my dad died of a heart attack when I was 35. My dad had just turned 59. This was a reality check, and I remember I cared so much because I had my son, and if I wanted my son to have me around when he was 35, I was at least going to have to live to 71 without keeling over from a similar health issue. 

I went and did a physical and blood work, found that I had high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I told the doctor my workout plan and diet, and set on my way. Following r/loseit was really helpful as well as r/keto. Within a year, I was down to my normal weight, and within two years I had a six pack, something I never had when I was younger. From that point, my doctor told me my health had exponentially improved, but I was thirsty for more. I wanted to look even more aesthetically pleasing, so I got a picture of the 300 cover photo and set about building my body for that Halloween. 

In that time, I think my wife and I must have grown apart. My wife used to always be fit when we dated, but after having our son, she must have been busy to go exercise. I invited her with me to workout (I saved up money and built a separate 2 car garage behind the house to build a home gym), but she would say she was tired or ""happy the way she was"". I would go for jogs with my son in the stroller, and whenever she joined us, she would insist we walk. I asked her to try jogging, and she would snap back asking if I don't find her attractive. Of course, I love my wife. I love her as the mother of my child, I love her as the daughter-in-law she is when helping my mother, and most of all I love her as my wife and how she is forever my companion. 

This became even more apparent with time. While I would be cooking chicken breast and broccoli for the week, she would say that I should start eating lasagna and fried chicken that I used to eat before. I told her that I didn't want to go back to being overweight/obese (my bmi used to be 32 and the doctor said that was classified as obese, now my bmi was 25, borderline overweight, but I am at 10% body fat) so I was careful with my food, and she got so upset. She asked if I thought she was fat, and I calmly told my wife to go ask the doctor because I thought she looked good, but I was biased. After her appointment the next week, she came back home crying. She said her doctor said she was overweight and should consider a diet plan and working out. 

I thought I would see changes in my wife's behavior, but nothing happened. Now, summer has come around, and my son is a bubbling ball of excitement and always wants to go to the pool. I take him to the community pool to play with other kids that live in our neighborhood, and my wife joins us sometimes. Last weekend, the neighborhood had a pool party, and everyone and their kids were there. My wife came, and my son and I were having fun, playing in the water and socializing with the people who came there. When we got home, after my son took a nap, my wife walked me into our bedroom, and started questioning me. She asked me if I was sleeping with X woman who was there, Y woman who was talking to me, or Z women whose kid I was helping dry off and talking too. I said I didn't know what she was talking about, and then she pulled out her phone to show me pictures she had taken from her seat. They were pictures of me smiling and talking to these women. 

I sat my wife down and told here I would **never** cheat. I have a son that she provided me, and a wife that I loved and cared so much about. She wouldn't accept that answer though. She said that I must be attracted to those women because they can look good wearing bikinis while she is heavier than them (her words, not mine). Then she changed the focus to me. She said I was getting all this attention because I was now fit compared to before, and it would cause me to waiver in my fidelity now that other women were attracted to me. 

My wife told me that she wants me back to my old self, when she didn't have to worry about other women and we could be comfortable together. She said she feels this undue pressure to become fit herself, and feels like its too stressful to maintain that lifestyle. 

Can someone please tell me what to do? I am not going to lie to my wife, but if I am being honest, I think she would be much more attractive if she tried to get back in shape. Even just **trying**. I don't know how I can tell her this without hurting her feelings or making her feel more insecure; can someone tell me how to approach that?


   
**tl;dr**: Now that I have lost weight and look fit, other women are flirting with me and my wife is starting to get jealous. She thinks that I will cheat on her in the future, and she wants me to get back to *my old self*."
"Me [18 M] randomly hooked up [17 F] and 3 days later she's pregnant.


Hey guys so I really fucked up and had a random hook up with this girl I knew very little. We had unprotected sex 😓 However I didn't cum from it, and I guess three days later she hits me up with a picture of a positive pregnancy test through snapchat. Is it possible for her to be pregnant 3 days after we had sex??? It seems way too fast.




Also she told me that a few weeks ago her and her ex had unprotected sex and she had to get Plan B, so she had a scare before. Another weird thing was that after sex she texted me that she had bleeding down there another weird thing. Am I just in denial guys or did I just really fuck up my life bad?


   
**tl;dr : hooked up with girl didn't really know had unprotected sex 3 days later she's pregnant... Wtffff




Update : You guys were a bit harsh but that is what I need. I was and am a fucking idiot for not using a condom and for almost falling for this girls bullshit. I had a weird feeling about this since she messaged and this thread really helped me out, I messaged her right now what you guys have told me that there is no way I'm the father and I would need a paternity test if she still thinks I am. I will update you guys with she says, I'm pretty sure she'll still think it's mine. Also I learned a very scary lesson I hope I am responsible enough to never be in this position again

"My husband (36M) and I (32F) stayed with friends this weekend, heard him and her (32F) late at night


This past weekend my husband and I went to visit friends of ours out of state, another couple. He and I have been married six years and together for 8 total. Our marriage has always felt pretty stable and I thought we were happy. My husband and I have very different personalities, I am extremely outgoing, can be attention seeking, have ADHD and constantly need stimulation. He's very much the opposite but we have always made it work. We went to therapy last year and came up with a solution, I often talk with people over the internet when he isn't around. It's always platonic and appropriate, he can always check them if necessary. I've never had anything to hide, he doesn't mind that I use the messaging apps (or reddit) to go on. 

Recently, past three months or so, we haven't been having much sex. I have tried to initiate conversations, suggest changes (frequency, type), offering to stop talking to other people all together, changing things, but nothing. He says he is just stressed and doesn't want to have sex. It has caused some tension and has forced me to pull back a bit. 


Anyway, back on track. Saturday night we were staying with our friends and sleeping on an air mattress in their study/den type room. I fall asleep early since I get up super early every morning while my husband is more of a night owl. Well, I woke up randomly at 1am and couldn't sleep. I could hear my husband talking very very quietly so moved to see if I could hear him. He was talking to my very good friend (32F), they were discussing me. Mostly how he isn't happy and he doesn't know how to talk to me and how coming to see her is a bad idea. That we never should have come, that it's hard seeing her like this. That he misses her. On and on about this. He was a bit frantic and she didn't say anything for about five minutes. I couldn't hear great honestly, and admittedly maybe misheard some, as I was hiding in the next room over so they couldn't hear or see me there. But then she started telling him that they should have told me in the beginning, that they couldn't go back there right now, she loves him always but not right now, they are trying for a baby (I assume her and her husband), she misses him too. I don't know what they are talking about, they didn't know each other before we were dating and I don't particularly remember them being close or anything at some point. I wasn't drunk, high or under any influence, but I didn't hear everything. She only moved three hours away a year ago, so possibly this happened when they lived closer? I feel like I am trying to justify or explain away what I heard, but it was clear that at some point they were sleeping together, or having some form of an affair.

I didn't say anything yesterday but he was fine. We held hands, kissed, cuddled, and had an overall good day with our friends. Today we drove home really early this morning, and I asked him about the weekend, if he was happy with how it went, if we were okay, pretty much the general answer was ""fine, okay, yes, of course we are good babe."" Nothing out of the ordinary. But it's still bugging me, I don't know what to do or who to ask what I should. I feel like I should straight out ask him, but then part of me thinks I should ask her first?  



   
**tl;dr**: Heard my husband and friend talking, think that they are either having an affair or had one, not sure how to handle it. "
"How do I [28M] cope with my sister [12F] having her first boyfriend [12M]?


I'm my little sister's guardian at the moment and I've pretty much taken on a fatherly role towards her. Unfortunately, six years ago both of our parents died in a car accident. It was so hard for me, but it was even harder for her honestly. I'd had 22 years with my parents and I enjoyed being their child and I still have tons of memories to cherish of them. On the other hand, my sister didn't really have that much time to be with them, and I find it unfair.

At the time I was directly out of college and working at an decently paying entry level job. I made it my mission to raise my sister, because I knew that it would be what my parents wanted and I felt a sense of duty to her as her older brother. I took her to a child therapist to help her properly cope with the grief.

While parenting a child by myself initially took some time to get used to, having a great support system around me made the transition very easy. Our family was always willing to help out by babysitting whenever I needed it, having female member educate her about women issues, or just giving me the night off and helping her with her homework and making her dinner.

Two weeks ago, my sister came home from school and told me that she had great news to tell me. I asked her what it was and she said that a boy in her class had asked her out and she said yes. She told me that he invited her to go see a movie together and she needed me to take them because it was PG-13. I took them and he seemed like a nice enough kid and I really had no objections to make.

Recently, I started thinking about it and I honestly just burst out in tears crying. I'm not upset that she's dating someone, that is perfectly normal. However, the thought of her growing up soon and being on the road to adulthood just makes me so sad for some reason. Its like, we have had six great years together that have blown by really quickly and in just six short more years she will be an adult. Just thinking about it makes me sad and nostalgic for those times when she was still that innocent little girl.

Other people who have experience in raising children, is this kind of feeling normal? What is the proper way to cope with it?

**TL;DR**: The concept of my little sister growing up has really been bumming me out lately."

"[UPDATE] Me [26F] with my husband [26M] together five years, he doesn't think it's fair for him to get a part-time job to help pay off his student loans


[Here's the OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m19w1/me_26f_with_my_husband_26m_together_five_years_he/)

First, thank you to everyone who offered advice, anecdotes, and criticism! 

When my husband and I talked about a second income, he immediately started applying to jobs and got a call shortly after. I mentioned in my later comments that my husband had just been offered an interview. It was for a research organization and his job would be making calls and collecting data. Not thrilling but in a previous life he was a canvasser and is used to talking to strangers and making a script sound natural. He had the interview and within 24 hours they offered him a job. They asked how much he makes at his current job, and are paying him about a dollar less per hour. 

The job is also 5-9 pm M-Th every other week, so he has all weekends free for sports and working every other week makes it feel less overwhelming. On nights he works I take care of stuff around the house that he would normally do in the evening, but it's allowed me to expand my days so I'm at the office longer. So now I'm not sitting around snacking when he's not home, and I get the office to myself and during my down time I can study for the GRE in silence without cats bugging me and people watching TV and doing laundry.

It's weird but he really likes his second job, he's learning a lot about the issue they're researching, says it's boring work but easy and relaxing, and it helps that he's really good at it. He got his first full paycheck last week and he'll be making almost triple a month what we initially needed! I had told him that if he really hated it he could decided whether he wanted to stay or leave, but he's enjoying it. All the money he makes is going into a separate account and his loans will be taken directly from there, so I can save my raise money and he can also start saving his own money while fully contributing to household bills. 
   
**tl;dr**: Husband wasn't sure if it was fair for him to get a job because he participates in sports he doesn't want to miss out on, and values his free time (as does anyone). Got a job immediately because he rules. He's weird and loves the second job. All is well. "

"I [21F] am going on a trip to Mexico with my sorority, my boyfriend [21M] asked me with tears in his eyes to not wear a bikini at the beach.


So my boyfriend of 3 years, Robert, and I have been together since freshman year of college. I'm in a sorority and there's a trip to Mexico we make every 4th of July (no one's required to go, but 90% of us go) for about a week. It's our sorority, a few other sororities, and some frat houses. We go to Mexico, hang out, swim, boating, etc. College kids on break kind of stuff  

So when I went at the end of freshman year, my boyfriend (whose not in a frat so he doesn't go) was just like ""alright have fun"". At the time I had a skinny-fat body (healthy weight, no muscle, looked blah in a bikini). 

At the end of sophomore year, I went again. A few months prior to the trip, one of my sorority sisters got me really into weight training &amp; nutrition. My body looked somewhat different but not exponentially. Again, boyfriend was like go have fun. 

Now at the end of my junior year, my body looks way different. I've lost fat, gained muscle, and finally got a booty (squats and donkey kicks, y'all). My sorority sisters have all commented on how my physique has changed and Robert loves it too. Time rolls around for our annual trip and I'm packing (Robert and I share an apartment near campus).  

He sees that I'm packing bikinis and says ""I need to talk to you"" and tells me with tears in his eyes that he doesn't want me to wear bikinis or anything revealing on the trip this year. He said that because my body has improved so much that other guys will be all over me and also said what is, in my opinion, the corniest line in history - ""baby, I trust you, it's all those guys I don't trust.""

I'm like ??? It's one thing if he had been super controlling and crazy about it because I would've just shut him down. But he was really sweet about it and seemed genuine. At the same time tho its not like I'm not a child and I don't like being told what I can and can't do. On top of all that, I've been with him for 3 years and love him. I don't know what I should do.

"My (30F) Fiance (32M) Passed Away


This is my first post, I apologize for the length.


The love of my life passed away 26 days ago, we were just 65 days away from our weddings (we were having two ceremonies because we come from different backgrounds). From the day we met we knew we were meant for each other and we never spent a day apart. We were together for an amazing 15 months and we were engaged for 4 of those months. We love each other so much and he was an amazing man with an amazing heart.


When my love proposed to me he promised me a very optimistic 65 years together. I always told him that 65 years is a very long time and here's hoping we get that much time together, but at the end of whatever time we actually do have I have to be the one that goes first because I never want to find out what a day without him feels like.


One month after we got engaged he became very sick, he always insisted that he was fine and that he would get better soon. Getting him to the doctor or emergency was an ordeal, he couldn't stand going there and he quickly became frustrated with all of the tests. I tried so hard to get him to go to the doctor and get tests done quickly so that they could find out what was wrong and help him faster, it hurt so much to see him so sick. My love was a stubborn man and even though he was slowly getting to the appointments and tests, it just wasn't fast enough. He unexpectedly passed away in his sleep after being sick for three months. It was a huge shock to everyone because not once did a doctor say his life was at risk. I didn't even believe it when I heard.


I feel like the day my love passed away is the day my life ended. I cannot understand the point of my existence anymore, I waited 29 years to find the love of my life and now he has been taken away from me forever. From searching online I see that this happens more often than you would think and I've read the stories that others have shared about how they lost their loves, but nobody really says what happens after.


I cannot stomach the thought of carrying on here without him, I am not suicidal, I just wouldn't mind if all of this ended and I could be with him again. I also don't know how to accept that I will be alone for the rest of my life, he promised me forever and I did the same, I don't ever want to break that promise to him. The only thing that brings me comfort is knowing that he is no longer sick and can no longer feel any pain. I also have hope that I will one day see him again.


I miss him so much and my heart hurts for him more and more each day. I'm so tired of crying. I hate how depressing I sound when people try to talk to me. I hate that my life has become so terrible that everyone is ""so sorry"" and ""can't even imagine"" what I'm going through. No, most people can't imagine and I would never want anyone to even try. It's too horrible of a feeling.


Has anyone here been through this? When does it stop hurting? Where did your life take you after such a tragedy? I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, I feel like I'm living in a nightmare.


Thank any of you in advance for your help/advice.


TL;DR; My fiance passed away, will it ever stop hurting? What usually happens to the surviving partner?"
"My wife [27F] has asked me [29M] to stop talking to my best friend [28F], and is upset that I'm sad about it.


Callie and I have been friends for essentially our whole lives. We played together as children, we even had sleepovers as kids. She basically lived in my treehouse when her parents were going through a divorce, and when my cat died, she held me for hours while I cried. We were next door neighbors, and we were roommates in college. She's been part of every major life event of mine, and I've been part of hers. When I first met my wife, Callie was the one who I'd spend hours gushing about Laurie to, and she quickly and easily embraced Laurie. They've gotten along fantastically as far as I knew. 

When Callie met her husband, it was all very much the same. We welcomed him into our friend group, and had a bunch of fun as a couple of couples. We went on vacations together, did little day trips in our area, went on hikes and did other activities together. We had dinner with each other regularly, it was almost idyllic. 

Callie's husband, Chad, decided earlier this year to end his life. His death shook us all, but obviously, it shook Callie the most. It took my bubbly, optimistic, generally upbeat best friend and destroyed her. When she found out she was pregnant and then miscarried soon after, it destroyed her again. As her best friend, and essentially brother, she leaned on me a lot. She leaned on my wife too, and Laurie was happy to be there for her, but Callie leaned on me a bit harder. 

She's doing a lot better now, but she's not the same and I don't think she'll ever be quite the same ever again, and that's understandable. I still love her immensely, and I'll always be here for her, which I've communicated to her. We still have lunch together almost every day, and we text frequently. I've never hidden any of our interactions from my wife, and have actually gone to her several times to discuss them, because she gives amazing advice and I want her input. 

However, Laurie hit me with an ultimatum today. Either Callie goes, or she goes. She says that she can't handle knowing that I love another woman, the way I love Callie. I tried to explain that I love Callie the same way I love my brother. There's no romance to my love for her, and there's no attraction at all, on any level. I don't see her that way and I don't have the capacity to, because we grew up in such close proximity. We were over at each other's houses as kids all of the time and her mom even grounded me...on more than one occasion. That is how close our families are. She said that she doesn't care that this choice is hurting me, and it's a choice that I need to make. She says that I need to decide if a life with Callie as my friend is more important than a life with her, and to me, this feels exactly like someone saying ""Pick me or your sister.""

I'm sitting here at a crossroads. She has given me two days to grapple with this and make my choice, and I honestly don't know how to handle this. I don't want to lose either of them, because I love them both in such different ways. Callie is essentially my sister, and my wife is well...my *wife*. Laurie is the love of my life, and I'd be destroyed if I lost her. On the other hand, Callie is a lifelong friend, and losing her would wreck me too. I feel like I'm in an unfair situation. 

I've never spent time with Callie that my wife wasn't aware of, and she's *encouraged* me to go spend time with her when I was more apt to just stay home with Laurie. She's told me over and over again that she's proud of me for being so good to Callie and that seeing this proves to her that I'm a good man, because I don't just treat my wife well, I treat everyone in my life well. 

Laurie is currently upset that I'm even needing to think about this and has gone to the guest room. I've been instructed to leave her alone until I decide.

This feels like it's coming out of nowhere. It feels manipulative and hurtful and I'm frozen due to the shock and the pain of this situation. 

**tl;dr**: Wife very suddenly and out of the blue issued an ultimatum: life long friend or wife. Not sure how to proceed.

How do I even begin to digest this situation? What would you do in my situation? Is my wife being unreasonable, or am I? Are we both? Is there a middle ground that an outsider can see that I can't? Is there more to it than this? Is there something wrong with me that I didn't immediately choose my wife and I actually have to deeply think this through? "
"I [13F] feel awful my sister [15F] told me it was my fault my brothers [16M] girlfriend [16F] broke up with him because he had to come and pick me up. My sister told me that the whole family will be made if they find out


Hi, Reddit I need some adult advice because I feel really bad. I just turned 13 8 weeks ago so I am young and never used this site before. 

two weeks ago on a Sunday I was playing a local softball game with my team, it was just a fun game it was nothing competitive at all. My dad dropped me off and was suppose to come and pick me up after the game. My dad forgot because he was busy with his new girlfriend who is from Chicago I think. Dad lives with her and I live with my mom. 

He was suppose to come and pick me up at 4 in the afternoon. He was not there and I waited for an hour. I have to admit I started to feel a little scared because I was alone at this point in time. Everyone else had left with their parents. 

I called my brother and he was on a date with his girlfriend at her house. I called him and I told him dad had not showed up and he left right away to come and get me. He left while they were in the middle of their date or something. They were at her place so it's not like he left her without a ride 

He arrived 20 minutes later and took me to Red Robbin for dinner. He seemed upset but he did not tell me what was wrong. 

My sister told me she overheard my brother talking on the phone to somebody. He was telling them how his girlfriend broke up with him, he left in the middle of their date to pick me up. She wanted him to spend the night again and he told her that he couldn't. 

My sister basically blamed me for the reason our brother has been upset. She told me that if I go to my older sisters for advice or my mom that they will be angry I caused a break up. I don't know what to do. I don't want my brother, sisters and mom to hate me. 

tl;dr: My brothers girlfriend dumped him because he had to come and pick me up. My sister told me the family will hate me if they find out 

Update thing 

I am truly sorry everybody. I went and spoke to my brother as someone suggested to do. They never broke up my sister was lying to upset me. My brothers girlfriend told him to hurry up and go when I called him. My sister was lying to upset me 

the reason my brother was upset is my dad and him got into a argument earlier in the day and then dad left me which made him upset "
"[UPDATE] My [23F] husband [26M] doesn't want my mom [47F] to stay with us when she gets out of prison.


My last post didn't get many views and everyone pretty much just downvoted me, but you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pib84/my_23f_husband_26m_doesnt_want_my_mom_47f_to_stay/). It bothers me to read a post on /r/relationships and not know what happened so I figured I'd post an update. Thanks to everyone for your input, even if I didn't want to hear it or don't agree with it. 

I talked to my husband this past weekend and we pretty much got everything figured out. I told him how frustrated I was with finding transitional housing for my mom, and showed him all of the emails from these places that basically said they didn't have room, were only for immigrants, only for men, only for woman that have children, etc. and I told him that she had pretty much been receiving the same thing back in all the letters she had sent out. He said he was sorry and that he didn't realize I had been having *that* much trouble finding a place for her. He thought I was overreacting, which he thinks I do a lot. I don't think I do that, but whatever. Not the point. 

Anyways, he is still adamant that she doesn't need to stay longer than necessary, but he has agreed to let her stay until she finds a place, and if for some reason she absolutely cannot find a place (which I hope doesn't happen) we're going to pay for a deposit + first month's rent for my mom at a shared house or something similar. We both agreed that if we can do anything about it, we will avoid her going back to my grandpa's house at all costs. There is nothing for her in the tiny city. 

We also have some ground rules for her that I have mailed out in a letter for her to look over and hopefully agree to.

 - She is to have NO visitors. She'll have her own phone so she can call anybody she wants at any time, but I do not like having people in my home that I don't know. Neither does my husband. 

 - She can go wherever she likes during the day, but I will not be dropping her off and picking her up at people's houses. I will only drop her off and pick her up if it is job or housing related. 

 - She needs to be sending out at least 15 letters/emails a day for housing. Or calling these places. This sounds reasonable to me. 

 - She needs to go to NA or AA once a week.

 - If we find out she is doing drugs again, which is unlikely she will do as she won't have any money to buy anything and won't have a way to get anywhere since my suburb doesn't have any city buses, she will be on her own. No more help at all.

 - Therapy. My mom will need to go to therapy. I'm sure she has her own demons to deal with, like we all do. She doesn't have insurance currently so I'll look into low-cost therapy options in my city for now, and then see if she can get Obamacare since she doesn't have an income.

 - Most importantly, she needs to stay busy. My mom tends to start using drugs if she gets bored. So, I think that if she stays busy it would benefit her greatly. We have a gym, a dog that loves walks and swimming, a dog park very close to us, an awesome swimming pool, etc.



So, I'm not sure everyone will agree with this, but this is the best agreement my husband and I could come to. My husband really does love my Mom, and he only wants what's best for her. He mainly didn't want to help her so much that she stopped helping herself. But I am excited to have my Mom here with me. Thanks, everyone! Communication does it again. 


Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who offered constructive advice or even criticism. To those of you who sent me nasty messages - get a life. I'm not sure why you hate drug addicts so much and feel the need to let your anger about it out on me but I hope you work past whatever issues you have. 

I've updated my list for the requirements for my mother, and I think she is going to love what I have. I'll send her out another letter as soon as I can! Thanks again everyone.

 - She is to have NO visitors.

 - She is not to use my laptop, but I will buy her a chromebook she can use and keep.

 - She is not to use my cell phone, but I will purchase her a phone she can use and keep.

 - She needs to be working on finding jobs and/or transitional housing for a least 3 hours a day. A goal of applications or phone calls would be 8-10.

 - She needs to go to NA (or another type of group) every single day. 90 in 90.

 - She needs to go to therapy. I will look into low cost therapy and see if she is eligible for Obamacare so she can go at least once a week. I will also offer to keep paying for this even after she lives with me.

 - She needs to stay busy. I will support any hobby she wants, but she needs to stay busy to keep herself out of trouble. 

 - And the most obvious, no using drugs. This is the only requirement she will automatically be kicked out for. The other things will have to be talked about between the three of us if they are broken.

"I [16M] bought my brother [27M] wife wedding ring for him. Am I right for being upset that he did not thank we at his wedding when he was going through the list of people who helped put the wedding together


So I have always been really good with money. I technically have been working since I was 13 years old. I walk mow the neighbours lawns, deliver news papers on my bike, clean the house and I would get payed for all of this. My mom from the day I was born had an account for me that she would put $100 in every 2 weeks. She did this for all of us. (my 3 sisters, myself and my brother). Right now I work at the mall.  

Mom and Dad are not short of money, they both really successful people. I have saved alot of my money that is almost (still have some, but it is significantly reduced from what it was, cars are expensive :() now all gone since I bought my car. Before that though my brother came to me and told me they had blown through all the money my parents gave them for the wedding. I found it hard to believe because my parents gave them more money than I would know what to do with. 

I felt bad for him because I love his wife, nice person. She would pick me up from Football when I did not have a ride. She works for a news paper and got me an interview with an actual journalist. It was for a school project on a topic we were doing. Needless to say my group loved me for it. 

So I took money out of my account for him and he bought a wedding ring. I did not see him again until the wedding. At the reception he was going through a list of everyone that made the wedding possible. I thought I would at least get thanked at the wedding. Without me what was he going to put on her finger? a candy ring?

Did not mention my name once and I was completely stunned. I felt like walking up, taking the ring back and returning it. He has not thanked me one time for the wedding ring, not even once. 

I plan on confronting him when he gets back to Beaverton. What do I say to him? or how do I handle this situation 

tl;dr: Brother asked me to buy his wife wedding ring using my savings. Has not thanked me once "
"My (30M) wife (29F) has been lying to me about something trivial for years. Not sure how to react.


Duration of relationship: 10 years together, 2 years married.

Earlier this week, my wife (""Amy"") accidentally revealed a lie she has been keeping up for years now. The lie itself is so trivial that I'm baffled about how to respond to this situation.

She came home from work and started telling me a funny story she had heard from an Uber driver earlier that day. After the story, I paused and said, ""Wait, why were you in an Uber? Weren't you at work all day?"" (She walks or takes the bus to work.) She froze and got a deer-in-headlights look on her face. She said, ""I had to run an errand, don't worry about it,"" and quickly changed the subject. I tried to change the subject back, and she said again, ""Just don't worry about it, it doesn't concern you.""

I'm not proud of what I did next but I just had such a weird, nagging feeling about it. I looked in her email (our passwords are open to each other, but I've never felt the need to look in her email before) and read the Uber receipt. I googled the dropoff address and it was a salon that does eyelash extensions. Then I checked her credit card (we have separate credit cards for ""fun money"") and confirmed that she had a purchase at that location.

I was so confused about why she wouldn't just tell me she got eyelash extensions? What's the big deal? So, I admitted my snooping, and asked her about it.

First she was furious at me for going through her stuff, so the whole conversation had a very confrontational and angry tone. I asked her why she wouldn't just tell me that she had gone to get eyelash extensions, and she said it was none of my business and she had the right to have some personal, private stuff. I said that of course she did, but I don't understand why she wanted to keep that in particular private. She also admitted that she has been doing this every 2-4 weeks for the better part of five years. So once or twice a month for five years she has been sneaking away, making sure I don't find out where she's going, and getting this done. I don't care at all about getting her eyelashes done, but the sneaking around and lying gives me a bad feeling.

The weirdest part to me is that this has been a really explicit lie. We have a 10 month old daughter and people comment all the time on how our daughter has gorgeous eyelashes, and my wife comments that it must be genetic because her own eyelashes are so long and thick.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for here, but generally I could use some perspective and advice on how to move forward. Do I write this off as a weird quirk of my wife and never bring it up again? Or do I keep snooping (on the sly) to verify she's only lying about this one, trivial issue instead of anything else? Am I overreacting by caring about this at all? I always thought of my wife as honest maybe to a fault (like if I exaggerate to make a story better, she always corrects me and tells the real version) and this is making me worry that maybe she's a different person than I thought she was.

**tl;dr:** I caught my wife in a trivial lie. I don't actually care about the thing she lied about, so I'm confused about why she lied and worried that maybe she's lying about other stuff too?

----

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback, it seems like most people think I am totally overreacting. It was helpful hearing all the different perspectives, I think what I was missing was that she might feel justifiably shy or embarrassed about her beauty routine. It honestly never occurred to me that there would be a reason someone would want to hide something like that, and to me this was like someone hiding for 5 years that they dropped off their clothes at the dry cleaners every other week. It's not a bad thing to do, so why lie!? But my eyes have been opened and I understand now that there are a lot of reasons that women feel the need to be secretive about their beauty habits. I'm going to apologize to my wife one last time and then never bring this up again."
