"UPDATE: I'm [27F] having troubles answering people's questions about my pregnancy, caused some drama with friends (all 20s)


[removed]"
"[UPDATE] Me [20s F] with my fellow student [20s M], fellow student has a history of harassing women and is applying to become a teacher in our department. Should I do something?


About a month ago I posted about my worries on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uq0sv/me_20s_f_with_my_fellow_student_20s_m_fellow/). 

**tl:dr** of original: fellow student often harasses young female students and was applying for a job that would put him in a position of authority over exactly those students he targets. I felt I needed to do something to prevent this from happening. 

My special thanks go out to /u/time_keepsonslipping and /u/Pillbot10011 who had a very, *very* good discussion on sexual harassment in academia and how this was quite a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. However, they did help me see that I actually had a solution that was staring me right in the face. 

I went to my mentor, a male professor who's high up the management ladder and actually even responsible for HR for the part of the organization that concerns this story. (Like I said, the solution was *really* staring me right in the face.) I trust this man and I knew he would believe me and follow up on my worries without a second thought. 

I wasn't wrong. I went to see him and simply told him something was worrying me deeply and I needed some advice, after which I told him the story. Now, you should know, this man is a very calm and funny guy. This was the first time since I've known him to find him go quiet and to see anger build up in his eyes. 

He asked me for the name of this person and I told him who it was. Then he told me he will go to HR straight away to ask about the status of his application, and if needed would use his executive position to veto the application. 

He came to see me the next day to tell me the department had already turned down the guy based on his qualifications, so in the end, I was worried for nothing. **However**, we started talking about the subject of (sexual) harassment students may face and how they feel rather helpless because they don't really have anyone to turn to and the system actually discourages students from speak up about it.

Turns out this professor has been very, *very* active in trying to implement integrity and equal opportunity policy on a university wide level, but this was only focused on staff, not students. He took it upon him personally to see policy will be revisited on a university level to also include protection for students, not just staff and that he would use my example as the reason why we need to do this as a university. He also told me that in terms of short term action he would personally go to each department head that falls under his jurisdiction to discuss this matter.

When I spoke to him again some time later, he told me the department heads weren't really open to even acknowledge the problem (surprise, surprise) let alone do something about it. But he's not the kind of man to take no for an answer, so he's planning to go over their heads and develop some management tools for the whole organizational unit that he hopes will also affect the individual departments. 

In the end, I am really glad I took action. Even though in the end, action wasn't needed to prevent the thing I was worried about, I think me speaking up to my mentor has triggered some processes on different levels in the organization that will hopefully lead to some change. I know from experience that this is a very slow process, and I won't notice much change before I'll leave my university, but still, a start was made. If anything, it will lead to more awareness of this issue on different managerial levels. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out. 

**tl:dr** - Had a chat with a professor I know high up the ladder in management. Turned out, fellow student wouldn't have gotten the job anyways. However, my chat with that professor triggered - I hope - positive action on a broader, university wide level that will hopefully lead to some positive change in the years to come.  "

Hey guys.

My original post garnered more attention that I've ever personally received here so I figured I'd do an update.

Shortly after my post, John (the boyfriend) and I broke up.
Big surprise right?

It was mostly mutual, still really sucked.
He pushed to try and ""make things work"" -- What does that even mean?

And would constantly flip flop from ""I'm never moving back"" to ""Well, I'll move back for YOU"".

No thanks.

A) I wasn't a reason to stay here in the first place, so why would I be the reason he would move back? and B) seems like a quick path to resentment if I'm the sole reason he would be moving back.

So yeah, we broke up.
I unceremoniously sent back what few belongings of his I had to his new address.
We went NC shortly after.

Details emerged several weeks following from various sources (I.E. mutual friends, randoms) that while we were dating there were ""always girls at his apartment"".

Okay...cool.
Didn't know what to believe.

A week ago I was cleaning out my car and found makeup under the passenger seat that didn't belong to myself or any of my female friends.
I also should add that John frequently borrowed my car on occasion during our relationship.

So idk, he was probably also cheating/at the very least being shady.

Somehow this person I'm not even with anymore continues to be able hurt me.


Luckily other areas of my life are coming together nicely.
I recently got a new job that I love.

I'm also working at two different places and 7 days a week so I don't have time to be a total mess haha.
I have more money than I've ever had in my entire life and no longer have to sweat bullets when it comes time to pay my bills.

Currently still in the post breakup phase of crying in my car on the way home from work sometimes if I'm particularly exhausted.

I've done all the stereotypically ""moving on stuff"" like cutting my hair, going on a few dates, getting drunk, shopping, masturbating, etc.

But I still miss him and he still occupies a good portion of my thoughts.
Just kind of waiting for it to pass I guess....

So yeah, thanks again to everyone who offered words of advice, wisdom, or kindness when I came here 2 months ago totally wrecked emotionally, I really appreciated it.

Hopefully whatever comes next is totally fucking awesome and I won't have anything to post about anymore üôÉüòÇ



**TL;DR: John and I broke up. Details of him possibly cheating during our relationship emerged shortly after. Still really bummed but life is looking up. Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond.**

"Me [30M] with my sister [32F], her son [11M] died and she's been staying with me, we (her family) are all worried she's wasting away, what can I do to help?


My nephew &amp; her son died in 2015 at the age of 11 and my sister  moved in with me several months later at my request because I felt like a little company might help. I won't pretend I know what it's like for her, losing my nephew was painful enough and it's likely a hundred thousand times worse for her.

Her engagement fell apart because she just couldn't do it anymore. She wasn't in any state to get married and ended things completely, we all tried to convince that maybe just putting off the wedding but not ending the engagement was a good idea but she cut off her fiance of 5 years (engaged for 1.5 yrs at the time) and just spiraled downwards. So I asked her to move in with me and she did. She has money &amp; contributes but that isn't my problem, I'd gladly foot the bill but outside of that and chatting sometimes, she's just quiet, stays in her room, she doesn't cry as much as she used to but she still cries a lot. She won't open up to our parents or sister (younger). She's ignored all her friends and even her best friend has stopped trying though she's admitted it's something my sister will need to work through when she's ready but she (the best friend) has to focus on herself and her own marriage and child for now. Her best friend had a son some time before my nephew died so I wonder if that's part of the reason she won't open up to her best friend of 20 years. 

I've suggested maybe speaking to a therapist but she doesn't care to see one. Is there anything I can do? How do I help?

"My [25F] GF [25F] of 6 months got a tattoo of my name despite me not wanting too


Title speaks for itself.


My GF Erica and I have been dating for 6 months. It's my 2nd relationship, it's her fifth.


Erica and I have been having a nice relationship so far. She's sweet, smart, funny, pretty, all I could ask for in a girl. 


However, I want to take our relationship slow. Where Erica has liked to me more passionate about things. We hooked-up twice and texted a week when she asked to be exclusive, despite having broken up with her ex, with who she has lived together, 4 months before.


Anyway, a month ago she told me she wanted a new tattoo. Awesome, she has 2 tattoos already, they look very nice: A tiger on her arm and a quote from the movie 'Up' on her wrist. She suggested a tattoo of my name. I laughed cause I thought she was joking.


She wasn't. The whole month she asked about it, and I clearly stated that I didn't want it. I thought having a tattoo with the name of a SO is a huge risk, definitely after 5 months and I stated that clearly several times.


She told me it would be the 'sign of her love for me'. And that it would mean we would be together for 'a long time'.


The week before her tattoo appointment we had argued A LOT. I caught her texting girls on Tinder (we had an agreement to not be on Tinder), and she has been giving me advice for my future, including what to do with future gf's. I was extremely uncomfortable. Yet she went on and on.


I went to see my sister last Friday and when I saw Erica this morning, she had a 'surprise'. Low and behold, there is my name on her right-arm, including the date we became a pair.


What do I do?

"I [25F] did not miss my fiance [28M] when he was away on a business trip.


My fiance, Dave, and I have been together for over six years now. We met when we where both undergraduates in college. I was eighteen at the time and he was 21. 

Dave is an all-around good guy. Most of my family just adores him, especially my grandmother. He has really stood by me. After we had been together for about a year, I developed a serious illness. Even though I can tell it really scared him, he stood by me and gave me all of the support he could. I eventually made a full recovery. 

A year after I learned my illness was in remission, I graduated college and accepted an internship out of state. Dave could not feasibly go with me to the internship for a variety of reasons -- my room and board was paid for by my employer and Dave was finishing up grad school. For over a year, we lived apart. Dave was very supportive and even drove to see me once, an incredible feat considering the state of his car at the time and the distance he had to cover to see me. 

When my internship was nearing its end, I was offered a job in a rural area very far away from all of mine and Dave's friends and family. I accepted the job because it paid incredibly well and because it would offered me experience unlike what I could get in other places. Dave really stuck his heals in the sand on this one. He said that he, freshly minted from grad school, wouldn't be able to find a job in his line of work anywhere in the area, that I was basically forcing him into unemployment if he were to move with me. He told me that he couldn't do long distance again, that either we stay together or break up. I think he was hoping that I would return to our college town where he still lived and search for a job there. 

I did not back down. I told Dave that I was happy to do long distance and that he could come with me or that he could stay where he was, that that would be his choice. He eventually caved and moved with me, finding a job in his field almost immediately. 

We have been living in this rural area for over a year now. Dave has proposed and I enthusiastically said yes. We are now in the thick of wedding planning. I thought I was happy until Dave went on a business trip. While he was only gone for ten days, his absence has really given me a new outlook on our relationship. 

I did not miss Dave. Every day I came home from work and watched whatever I wanted to watch on TV. I cooked whatever I wanted to cook. I went to bed when I wanted to, not having to worry about Dave coming in much later and waking me, like he usually does. I slept better than I have in a really long time as Dave snores and disturbs my sleep at night. I did not miss Dave at all. 

I also started to think about all of the things I do not like about Dave. He complains a lot about almost everything. He really does not like the area we moved to and constantly reminds that he would be making SO much more money if he had stayed in our college town and gotten a job there. This makes me feel really guilty and while I have been outspoken about how those words make me feel, he still constantly complains to me. Dave also complains about his job, even though it is in the field he studied and went to grad school for. Dave also complained heavily while he was in school -- about the stress of classes, how much he hated his part time job, etc. I just thought it was the stress of the situation and would one day get better. He still complains, however, and while I know we are not in his ideal setting, we also make plenty of money, have health insurance, live in a nice house, drive nice cars, etc. Our lives are pretty decent and we enjoy a higher standard of living than we have ever previously had as adults. 

Dave is also a slob. I groaned this morning when I woke up and saw that Dave had ""unpacked"" from his business trip by dumping his entire suitcase out onto the living room. When Dave was out of town, the house stayed clean. There were no crumbs on the table or mystery plates in the sink when I woke up in the morning. This might be TMI, but the toilet was also much cleaner (no ""splatters"", if you know what I mean). 

All in all, I felt a lot less stressed. I'm usually the one who cooks dinner and cleans (even though we both work). Coming home and only having to take care of myself was such a nice reprieve. I actually dreaded Dave returning. 

Now, all of today, I felt awful and anxious. I realized that I'm not sure I want to go through with the wedding. I fantasized all day about moving to New York City, a place Dave has said is out of the question for us because he doesn't think he'll find a job there, and living alone or with a roommate. I dreamed of my tidy room and the healthy dinners I like to cook when Dave is not around to eat them or when I prepare another meal that's more suitable to his palate. I dreamed of all the free time I would have just taking care of myself.

But then the bubble burst because I realized that maybe one day, I would want to have a romantic partner again. Dave has his faults, but so does everyone. I am not an angel either. I often have a short temper and can at times be impulsive. Dave loves me and wants to marry me in spite of those faults. I feel terrible for loving my life in Dave's absence and for wishing us to no longer be together. Is this how all long term relationships work? Is this a normal way to be feeling about someone you are engaged to marry?

"My [21M] friends claim that my girlfriend [18F] ""is not jealous enough"" and that she's brainwashing me with her behavior. I don't know what to think.


I've been with my girlfriend for quite some time. We met when she was 16 (she's turning 19 soon) and I was 18. When I met her, she was going through a lot of things and suffering from a great deal of depression/anxiety. She has gotten much better though, and I'm very happy for her. I'll call her ""Anna.""

Anna is versatile in the sense that sometimes she acts like a ""bro"" and sometimes she acts like an extreme girly-girl. For example, I've seen her playing WoW while watching a makeup tutorial on her other monitor. Shocking, right, who knew that girls could like video games *and* makeup? */s*

She wears both masculine and feminine clothing depending on how she feels, etc. I don't want to get too into it because it really doesn't matter. Anna is also bisexual and we'll often talk about girls together, whether it's pointing out that someone is attractive or making silly jokes together.

I made the mistake of talking to my friend about this when he was talking to me about how his girlfriend always gets mad at him for liking another girls' picture on IG. I said something along the lines of, ""that sucks dude, Anna doesn't care if I do that,"" and I think that that lowkey set him off, because the next day we hung out with our whole friend group and they were all talking to me about how Anna doesn't really love me because she doesn't care if I ""talk"" to other girls (I don't talk to any other girls.) I tried explaining to them how she is, but they said that I'm being brainwashed into thinking that she's ""laidback"" and that I'm getting played. 

One of them even brought up an example in which me, Anna and my friends were out to eat, and she made a little joke about giving the waitress my number. It was all in good fun. I laughed. She laughed. Supposedly, no one else thought it was funny. They said that no girl who loves their man would ever say something like that, ""how is it possible that she's okay with that?"", etc.

Is this really that uncommon amongst her and my peers? Anna doesn't care about certain things, yeah, but the girl has boundaries. She doesn't care if I like a girls' pic (and honestly, I don't even do this to anyone besides my female friends that I value platonically and she knows this,) yeah, but she would definitely have a problem with me commenting, ""damn, you're sexy"" under another girls' picture. She'd definitely give a shit if I cheated on her, etc. but she is open to things like threesomes, which is something else that my friends don't understand. 

Anna and I have discussed all of these things, boundaries and all, a long time ago. Some people get jealous, and some people have insecurities, I get that, but I think that we have a very healthy relationship. Are we supposed to just hide that because it makes other people uncomfortable? I don't know what to tell my friends because they don't get it.

**EDIT:** I have read each and every one of your comments. They've helped me a great deal and although I can't reply to all of them, I appreciate them so much. Thank you guys.

"My (30, F) co-worker (33, F) wants my weekend time too


I (30, F) have been working in a small office with my co-worker (34, F) for six years. We were hired at the same time. I need advice as to whether I should be more firm with her regarding my boundaries or whether I should be more accommodating because six years is a long time to know someone. We have very different ideas of what our relationship is. 

I have clear work/life separation, and want to do great work when I am at the office, but during my off time want to be fully present in my private life with my family and friends. I do not want to be reminded of work, and I treasure my hobbies and weekend time to recharge with loved ones. 

My coworker is the exact opposite. She makes personal friends out of those on our work team, and asks me every week to do things with her and them on the weekend. I always say no. 

I thank her for inviting me, but tell her that honestly I will never attend weekend events with people I see 45 hours a week at work; that I have family and friends to see on the weekend and am busy with my personal life. I have told her more than once that she should stop inviting me to weekend events, it will not hurt my feelings, and it is tiresome telling her no every week. I would feel fine if her continued invitations were just out of politeness and I got the idea that she expects that I will say no, but she acts very shocked each time and tells me that she is surprised and offended that I don't plan on attending. No one else on our team invites me and I appreciate it. 

This co-worker will not give up. She has told me repeatedly that it is hurtful that I do not invite her to my weekend events and do not attend hers. She says it is not normal to spend as long as we have together and not have met each other's families. She pressures me to say I will make a real effort to stay in contact with her when the day comes that we are no longer working together. I find all of this unprofessional and will not promise her any such thing. I tell her that we are co-workers who see each other 45 hours a week, it is enough time together already. 

My co-worker runs to show me pictures of her weekend every Monday saying, ""Why didn't you come to this!? It was so fun! Please come with us next weekend!"" and I say, ""I'm glad you had fun, but I will not be joining.""  She often texts me during the weekend and after work and I do not respond to her texts. I don't respond to anything that isn't about work and during working hours. Her lack-of-boundaries bleeds over into work matters, as she is continually distracted from her tasks and does lots of personal chores on company time, but I am not her boss so I just ignore it and focus on my work. I have earned two promotions since we were hired and she has not earned any. I was hoping this last promotion would come with a change in teams, but unfortunately it didn't. I have some anxiety around always having to ""manage"" this person and push her away, and am wondering if I should stop talking to her altogether or grey rock, or just keep doing what I'm doing, or even schedule a set coffee break with her once a week to make her feel like I'm spending time with her so she'll ease up possibly. I have no idea. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a terrible and unfriendly person to be complaining about someone who wants to be friends with me. Other times I am just exhausted by her.

Is there anything else I can do in this situation? Thank you for your advice. 

**TL;DR: My co-worker wants to spend seven days a week with me, how do I maintain a professional relationship with a non-professional person?**"
"My boyfriend of 14 years broke up with me. Said he ""didn't love me enough to sustain a relationship."" I am simultaneously devastated and dead inside. I don't know what to do.


We met in our mid-30s and are now late 40s (I am female; he is male). We did not live together but had a life that very much revolved around each other. He has children. One now in college, the other going off. One day we were literally talking about big-ish future-type things, we had just gone away together, and a few weeks later he tells me he's not sure he ever loved me.

He's always been kind, always been generous. Says now he's just ""well domesticated"" and that maybe I don't have enough ""edge."" We never argued, not really. We always compromised. He said the relationship was great, enjoyable, that he will miss me. Said maybe the relationship was ""too good;"" that we never had to deal with anything difficult. I said this was difficult, why don't we deal with this. Fourteen years is too much to just let go. He smiled and said I was always so reasonable. Said a relationship counselor would just tell me what he was told when his marriage ended - to let it go.

I am not a part of his children's lives. There was too much strife in his past marriage to allow this. It always bothered me but I accepted he knew best how to manage his life. They know about me and talk of me and vice versa, but there could be no room for me in their lives. He has always been around for his children and a very present figure and did not want to add strife to an already difficult situation. His life is at a crossroads as the daily care and attention will soon not be needed and he will no longer need to be in his ex's orbit with such frequency.

He had come to my place unexpectedly. To both tell me this and give me my stuff and ask for keys. I could not. I said he knew me well enough to know I wouldn't do anything horrible. He agreed.

I am numb. I am in shock. I don't know what else to do but ask internet strangers for help. (BTW, long-time lurker, first time poster.)

"My ex [22M] and and I [22F] broke up after he gave me an ultimatum regarding my choice in jobs. Now he wants to try dating again. I'm very confused.


So, my job. I'm a bottle girl in a popular club. I run around all night bringing bottles to tables in v.i.p sections. I'm basically there to make sure the men in these sections get as drunk as possible, and get more female attention than they know how to handle. And obviously make money for the club.

Before this, I worked at a grocery store. Zach and i were part time cashiers, full time students. We were two broke students. I mean, poor. Extremely poor. Zach had higher rent than I did and I would do my best to keep him fed. It sucked. Really, really sucked. We were together for 5 months before the ultimatum.

So one day we were talking about changing jobs, and Zach mentioned that we should both get a second job. Some kind of night shift. We both started looking up jobs like crazy, I asked my friends, ect. One of my friends mentioned her friend, another bottle girl. Her club was hiring. So she gave me her friends number. After this, I texted Zach about the whole thing and at the time he seemed pretty excited about it all. He said it was awesome. He didn't take this chance to raise any concerns.

I text the girl and I end up going to the club to be interviewed not long after that. Since I basically had a referral, I got the job. I was ecstatic. The pay was much, much more than the grocery job. At this point I make twice as my old job, and on good weeks I make even more.  So I told Zach, with the intent of celebrating that we won't be broke anymore and that's when he gave me the ultimatum. When i saw him that night, Zach said the job is inappropriate, disgraceful, and he's not comfortable with me doing it. He said I need to call the club and tell them I changed my mind, or we would have to break up. I was completely surprised. He hadn't spoken up all at any point. He didn't even say anything when I was nervous before going to the club. He had a week and a half to raise any doubts.

So, we didnt argue but I was very firm that I needed this money, and i already had the job. I was tired of living this way. So, we broke up then and there.

So I cried, mourned the relationship and life went on. I've been at my new job for 5 months and I'm very happy. I've been able to get rid of the small credit debt that I did have, and I'm planning on getting my first car this summer.

Zach, for some reason, called me the other day. And he basically said that he missed me dearly, hes felt like he made a mistake ever since that day, and he apologized for springing the ultimatum on me. I told him it's all good, everything is forgiven and I apologized if I made him feel like he couldn't speak his mind or raise his concerns in the time before I got the job.

Zach asked me to get coffee with him, I said sure, and while we were there he mentioned he still worked at the grocery store and he didn't end up getting another job. I let him know im still a bottle girl. He also asked if I would consider dating him again because he feels like I'm the one that got away. I was shocked, and I told him I had a lot to think about. So now I need help figuring this out.

In general, do you guys think I should date him again? Will my job become an issue again, do you guys think he's pretending it's not an issue anymore?

Does ""taking back"" ultimatums even make sense? I'm concerned if we did date Id get another ultimatum at some point. Ultimatums = dealbreakers right? So do you think he's genuinely changed his mind about the job, or hes saying anything to get me back?

I realize people grow and mature, I want to give him the benefit of the doubt but I've also heard exes need to stay exes. I get that plenty of men would be unhappy if their gf had this job, and I do feel it might be foolish to try. I don't know.

Basically, if you were me would you date Zach again? I'm 50% yes and no at this point. He was an awesome guy, but obviously there were communication issues. Ones so bad that we got to the point where I was surprised by an ultimatum.

Tl:dr: ex changed his mind about the ultimatum that broke us up and wants to date again. Should I? Do you think he's being genuine?"

"[UPDATE] My [21F] best friend [23F] admitted to catching feelings for me while drunk and I don't know how to respond.




This is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5yfjr0/dating_my_21f_best_friend_23f_admitted_to/


So after that post I tried to hint to my friend that I'm ready to talk openly with her. She immediately shut me down and said she just didn't want to talk.

The next day she came to me and agreed to talk. It was awkward, painfully awkward. The entire thing was drenched in sarcasm to make it less tense. I told her that I liked her as well, but her hesitation was making me nervous. Eventually we gave up on talking.

Two days later I woke up to a letter under my door. She wrote about two pages about what she wanted, what she was worried about, and basically poured her heart out in it. I did my best to respond to her concerns in the letter as well as add in what I wanted and left my letter under her door the next night. 

After that, talking was much easier. We basically agreed on not forcing anything since A) she is still discovering her sexuality and B) We don't want to do anything that would risk our friendship.  So we have opened the door, but made no serious decisions. There has been a lot of flirting and cuddling. I'm hopeful for our future.

Tl;dr We couldn't talk so we wrote letters back and forth and now we are open to see what happens."
"My mom[45F] always steals my[21F] style. Most of the time I brush it off but this time I told her no. She didn't take that well. I just want some things of my very own. Need advice. Non-romantic.


If this is in the incorrect subreddit, or if there is a better subreddit for me to post in, please advise!


Compared to other posts in this subreddit this may seem petty. However, I need opinions of who is in the wrong and advice, if any.


My mom[45F] seems to always copy or steal the things I[21F] wear. When I've shopped in the misses section in the past, she does for herself too. I start shopping at a certain store, she does too. I start wearing Express brand jeans, she does too. I start putting on cat-style liquid eyeliner, she tries to too. 

She will steal my clothes and I basically never get to see said stolen item again for several reasons, and if I do it is not in the same condition it was when she stole it. She will wear said stolen item several times a week and always store it back in her room/closet. 
She is around a size 6-10 while I am around a size 0-2 so she stretches out/mis-shapes the things she steals. (I‚Äôm sorry if that sounds mean.) 
She imbeds my clothes with the smell of smoke and strong perfume, both of which I cannot stand the smell of. She usually just hangs the things she wears up for at least 2 weeks to a month before she washes them. 
So basically she steals the item in pristine condition and then either never returns it or it‚Äôs practically ruined. One time I stole a shirt back and she got all huffy puffy about it.


Now, onto the most recent issue.  


A few weeks ago I ordered 12 different matte liquid lipsticks. Yes, 12. I had them all in a cup on my dresser near my door. She notices them and looks through them and says how she doesn't like any of them. (I'm thinking...Good.) 
About a week later we go out to dinner with my family and I wear said lipstick. I had to get ready in her bathroom since my brother was showering in ours. I left the cup of lipsticks in her bathroom. Goddammit. Anyways, she says at dinner ""Oh, I like that one!"" 
So a couple of days later she comes home from wherever and I notice she is wearing that lipstick. My blood begins to boil. I ask to confirm if it is my lipstick and of course it is. I steal back my cup of lipsticks and put them on my dresser under my tv. 
She comes into my room today after going to the grocery store and is like ""Ohh, there's those lipsticks!"" and starts going through them ""Can I have these two?, Can I have this one? Can I give you the money and you can just buy another?"" ""No."" ""That's tight!!!"" Then she storms out of the room. About 5 minutes later she comes back into the room practically stomping to 'throw out a water bottle.' I currently have the biggest garbage can in my room since I'm sick and blowing my nose every two seconds, but there's like 3 other garbage cans to throw them in upstairs alone. All while saying ""I can't believe you won't blah blah blah even after I went to the store and got you this this and this!"" -.- Yes, I appreciate that she got stuff for me while at the store. When she was sick I drove her to the doctor, laid in bed with her, and offered to go to the store every day and went two-three times for her. It doesn‚Äôt have to do with the lipsticks at all in my opinion.

Now she‚Äôs made me feel absolutely guilty and a bad person for it. She has an incredibly short temper so I won‚Äôt be surprised if I get shit for the next week for it. She is almost impossible to confront without her just immediately yelling at me. 
I just want a couple of things that are my very own. I want to be different in a couple of ways. I do not want everything I wear to be copied or stolen. I just want to be my own unique person once in a while! I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense to anyone. Maybe I‚Äôm being selfish. 


Tl;dr: My mom[45F] always steals my clothes and most recently my[21F] lipsticks. She got all pissy/upset when I told her no she couldn‚Äôt have/use them. I just want a few things of my very own to be my own person once in a while! 


Does anyone have any advice on what to do from here or words of wisdom? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

"My (27F) husband (28M) of 7 years blew up on me last night


Hello guys, I'll try to keep this short. Sorry in advance for any grammatical errors - writing has never been my thing. 

My husband and I have had a decent relationship, we've been together 9 years and have been married for 7. We also have an 18 month old son together. I thought I could completely trust him until yesterday. 

Last night he had asked me to put a reminder in my phone to text him about something today. While doing that, I had noticed that his calendar had synced with mine, because I had put his email in my phone to see the messages his mother sends him. He knows I have his email in his phone, I look at it to check dates of get togethers, when his mother is going to pick up our son, etc. 

Anyways, I brought it up that I had his calendar reminders for his paydays, and I told him I also have his contacts too. I really didn't think anything of it, I didn't go through them or anything like that. I didn't bring it up before because I just completely forgot. 

Well, he freaked out on me and got really angry and defensive. It was completely out of character for him and I was shocked, to say the least. 

I went outside to cool down, and when I came back I tried to talk to him. I'm going to be honest and say that I was upset, but I was trying to be calm. I asked him why he was reacting like this, and he went off on me, saying that he's tired of this shit, I do this all the time, that I'm fucking crazy, and that I'm on my phone all fucking day so why didn't I bring it up to him. He also told me to check his phone if I didn't trust him. I honestly didn't even know how to react. I've never looked through his phone before or anything like that. Like I said, I trusted him and couldn't care less who he has in his phone. Plus, he's not stupid and would have deleted anything while I was outside. 

I guess I'm just lost. He calmed down and told me he doesn't know why he reacted the way he did, and to just drop it, but I'm having a really hard time doing that. The thing is, is that he doesn't go out much, so he's usually at home or work. He hasn't given me any signs about being untrustworthy, but I don't know why he'd act like that. I‚Äôm having a hard time believing that he would act like that for no reason, and now i think he's hiding something. Please give me some advice on how to deal with this. 

Thank you to whoever reads this, and again I apologize for any errors. 


**TL;DR:**My husband got uncharacteristically angry at me when I told him I had his contacts in my phone, and now I'm worried he's hiding something.

"A customer (40?f) in my (21f) workplace humiliates me and I'm too embarrassed to go back. [Non-Romantic]


I apologise if this isn't the right place, but I've seen similar posts here and its about my relationships with coworkers and customers.  

I work in a casino and this particular customer is slowly ruining my life.  

She is part of a group booking that brings in a lot of regular income, so banning seems unlikely. She's been in multiple times before things started getting this nasty and has been vile to me every single time to the point where I've left in tears after every shift.

The first time she kicked off, she threw her cards into my face and I asked her not to because it was rude, she went mental and started telling everyone that I swore at her and insulted her.  

The next time she came in, she called over the manager and made a formal body hygiene complaint, which resulted in me being taken into the managers office where they told me how to wash properly, which is standard procedure, but was humiliating.  

However last night she came in, and was screaming it across the room. She was holding her perfume bottle under her nose pretending to urge, going over to the windows saying she was going to faint from my smell, saying it's ruined her day. She then spent the 8 hours of my shift going up and telling every single staff member and customer how bad it was.  

However, I couldn't smell anything, I had fresh uniform and had showered before my shift, and the managers said, 'I smell very faintly of fresh sweat, but what do you expect when someone's working in a hot room for 8 hours?' They privately asked other customers who were sat next to me, and they said the same thing, very faint fresh sweat and they didn't understand what she was complaining about. But she complained as soon as I sat down at the start of my shift.  

Now, I don't know how people perceive casinos, but they are disgusting places. Its full of people who spend all day playing online, don't wash (by their own admission!), and then come in and play all night. We've had people come in with three day baby sick covered tops, it is a disgusting place and that's what we thought she was smelling last time.  

But she has gone round to every single staff member and customer complaining, and now even though I know there was little truth to the complaint, I'm too mortified to go back to work tomorrow. I've been crying all day and had multiple showers and washed my uniform many times.   

I love this job more than anything and it'll be difficult to find anything that fits around my life like this job does.  

Has anyone got any advice? Or even some kind words would be helpful, please.  

Tl;Dr: Customer at work has been consistently vile to me, but last night made a show about 'how bad I smelt' for 8 hours, going up and telling every staff member and customer. I smelt faintly of fresh sweat, but now I'm so mortified I don't want to go back to work tomorrow and face everybody after that.

"My (34F) platonic close friend (35M) of 10 years asked me to marry him. Is this fixable?


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So, I've been friends with this guy for a bit over 10 years. You're probably assuming that this is some sort of ""friend zoning"" situation where he's been holding a torch for me for years - I assure you that this isn't the case (...I don't think. 99% sure). You see, throughout the whole course of our friendship, he's basically identified as gay. Went on dates with guys, talked about wanting to find some guy to grow old with, *completely* platonic towards me (and other girls). We've hung out drunk and alone together on countless occasions without even a hint of a move, no flirting, no interest. He's been like a brother to me. I say ""basically,"" because he *has* identified more as bi in the past (been with a girl or two before we met), he just wasn't really interested any more.

We've had a lot of deep talks, gone on road trips together etc, but we only hang out once every week or two and basically don't communicate in the mean time. It's fun when we hang, but we're not super close in any sort of ""regular contact"" sort of way, I guess is what I'm getting at, even though I'd still consider him one of my ""best"" friends. ANYWAY.

So, a few weeks ago, he calls me up, asks what I'm up to, and when I say, ""not much,"" says he has something to ask me and can he come over. This is already pretty weird, we *never* drop in on each other randomly in the middle of the afternoon, and we just saw each other a couple days ago. He shows up acting nervous, beats around the bush a bit, and then blurts out, ""Would you want to get married and have kids with me?"" I laugh in his face. I don't get the joke, but it's *clearly* a joke... right? He's not laughing. Oh shit.

My brain is all kinds of WTF. Is he having some sort of mental break? Is he dying of cancer? This is *definitely* a joke but I still don't get it. I ask a few questions. He's dead serious. I don't understand what is happening *at all*, but I make it as clear as possible that my answer is definitely 100% no, also WTF, and NO, and WTF??! all while trying not to be *too* mean about it. He leaves shortly after (seeming disappointed but not devastated) and my brain is exploding with questions and confusion and WTF.

I process a bit over the next few days, realize I have a lot of questions I *need* answered for my sanity and also to figure out if there's any hope of even still being friends after this. So we meet up again a few days later (after I make it clear that this isn't some sort of interview where the right answers might change my mind, it's 100% NO, I just really need to understand where the hell this is coming from) and I start blasting through my questions:

- Are you dying of cancer?
- No.

- Are you secretly in love with me?
- No.

- Did you ask because you thought *I* was secretly in love with *you*?
- No.

- Are you having some sort of psychotic episode? Should I be getting you help?
- I don't *think* so, I *feel* pretty normal, no weird mood swings or anything. But then again, how would I know?

- Why on earth wouldn't you try to lead up to something like that by maybe asking my thoughts on marriage and babies in general or something first?
- I thought I *did* do the lead-up option. I didn't even have a ring or get down on one knee!
- Oh. My. GOD.
- I mean, if you want a ring, I can go get one right now...
- Oh my god shut the fuck up you are insane.
- Just sayin.

- You know I don't particularly even *want* to get married and have kids, right?
- Well I certainly *wouldn't* want you to do anything you didn't *want* to! But, I really thought there was a non-zero chance that you'd say yes.

- ...HOW.

So then, lots of questions about *why*. What the hell brought this on, made this seem like a reasonable idea, how on earth does he *not* think this is insane, etc etc.

What I managed to get from him was a lot of different things. A big one was that he has a group of friends from a cultural background where arranged marriages are common, and they ""make it seem so simple. You just do it and you make it work."" So the fact that we'd never even had a romantic relationship didn't seem like a big deal to him. And of course, ""romance fades anyway, so it doesn't matter."" His parents have a fairly platonic relationship so that feels pretty normal to him. On that topic, his dad's apparently made jokes to him about us getting married, so that's an influence too I guess.

He wants a family. He wants someone to grow old with. Which made me feel like he just wanted to use me to fill a role, but he got offended at that interpretation and very passionately started insisting that he *didn't* want just anyone, he wanted *me*. Going on about ""seeing what was right in front of him,"" that we ""never had a bad time together"", that he trusted me and felt safe with me and ""committed"" to me. That he'd never once wanted to make an excuse to bail when we made plans, that if there was something I wanted to do or that was important to me then he was always 100% down. That I was loyal and smart and he always valued my opinion on things. That he considers me his best and closest friend. There was some stuff in there at one point about getting old and how he was starting to feel like ""the bachelor uncle"" (pretty much all his relatives are married with babies at this point), so I'm like half flattered and half insulted, I don't even know.

When I comment on the ""out-of-nowhere-ness,"" he says that he understands it feels really sudden to me, but he's been thinking about it for a while. That he's been ""trying to work up the courage to ask"" for *months*, but didn't want to ""ruin our good time"" with something ""heavy."" I feel weird about how long he's apparently been thinking about this with me having no idea.

After I feel like I *sort* of understand kinda where he's coming from, I once again reiterate my ""NO"" (I'm really paranoid about giving him false hope or leading him on), and he responds that if I think it's a terrible idea then I'm probably right. He says that he'll be fine either way, he just thought ""it would be nice."" He seems pretty okay with it and seems to drop it, despite leaving a little half-joking-but-also-not ""well if you change your mind..."" hanging there.

So... I start to think we can maybe move on. I'll give it a couple weeks and we'll hang out and we'll see if it's Weird or not. So we hung out last night and it was all chill and fun like normal old times for a while, and then IT came up and OMG. He started using terminology like ""*if* we get married"" (which I shot down every time), randomly showed me his bank balance and told me he has almost enough saved to buy a house loan-free, and the kicker - told me he's been thinking about this for *years*. Not the months he said before. I don't know how seriously he considers the ""thinking about it"" to be, if it was maybe just the seed of an idea in passing, but it feels like this is coloring *everything* now. When he made me breakfast that one time after I crashed in his guest room - was he trying to be a good host, or a ""good husband?"" When it was cold and snowy and he offered to go clear off my car for me - was he being a good friend, or a ""good husband?"" Did he suggest that fun roadtrip because he thought it would be fun, or because he wanted to prove to himself (and me) that we could get along well just the two of us, for days at a time?

I know what he'd say. He'd be offended at my suggesting he could be so calculating and manipulative. That he's happy with how things are. That he does things for me because we're friends and he likes making his friends happy.

I don't want to lose my friend. But I have no idea if that's even possible. Or if I even really know him. Maybe he *is* crazy. Or maybe he's just a bit aspergers or something that makes the social weirdness of this not seem that weird to him.


I'm losing my mind a bit over this. I catch myself thinking about it a *lot* in a kind of ""if life was a video game and I could make a save point, how would this play out"" kind of way. I do *not* want this. But it's weirdly compelling in a trainwreck sort of way I guess? Mostly I feel really bad for my friend that he feels so... alone? I guess? And I'm also terrified that next time I see him he's gonna confess his undying love for me or something. Or something equally crazy.

I need perspective. Am I overreacting by being freaked out? Underreacting by not running away screaming ASAP? I have no idea what to think or do. We really are quite close and have had a lot of really fun times over the years, it would suck to have to walk away from this. If he does turn out to be in love with me or something and not just... confused and lonely though, I think I'll have to.

TL;DR - Close friend randomly suggested marriage and babies. Need advice on WTF

Edit: Thank you all so much for your comments and replies, I've read every single one even if I couldn't reply to them all. It was immensely helpful to me, even seeing the full range of reactions from basically ""omg he's a serial killer RUN"" to ""I don't see what the big deal is, you should go for it."" For now, I'm finding myself agreeing with the general consensus of time and space being necessary for him to hopefully move on from this idea. I'm quite certain that he won't see the need for such, but I'll do my best to explain my thinking - I'm not gonna just ghost a friend after so long without a heads-up. Even if he doesn't agree, I know he'll respect my decision on this at least. I'll give it 2-3 months and then reassess. No contact shouldn't be too hard in practice, given our low level of contact normally any way. I'll give an update regardless. Thanks again all!"

"My husband[30m] and I[28f] have different parenting styles and it is ruining our relationship.


My husband and I have been married 7 years and have 4 year old son. Our parenting styles are completely opposite, I believe in a gentle parenting method and find yelling or becoming physical with your kids unnecessary. He takes after his own father's style of yelling and jumping to radical punishments that are hard to follow through with and inconsistent.

My son and I have a great relationship and he is a huge momma's boy, he always wants me over my husband. I have a ton of patience with him and rarely lose my cool. 

My husband and our son fight all the time. They are constantly yelling. I prefer to have a consistent punishment, like time out, every time he misbehaves, my husband threatens him with a ton of different punishments and my son gets very upset and the situation gets worse. 

He loses his patience so easily with him it makes me upset. I admittedly criticize his parenting in front of our son which I know is wrong and I need to work on that. My husband has mentioned that he wishes his father was less intimidating and more loving, but he parents the same way his Dad did despite this. He doesn't teach through example but through threats, how can our young son learn what he isn't shown?

This is just one of the issues in our relationship and I am going crazy. I struggle to be in the same room as him and don't have any romantic feelings towards him anymore. It feels like we are just living together raising our family, not enjoying each others company.

What can we do to work this out and be on the same page? We have had many conversations about this but we don't agree and nothing is resolved.

**TL:DR  my husband and I have disagreements on parenting issues, he won't change and it is making me dislike him. What can we do to get on the same page?**

**ETA in now way is my husband abusive to our son! Rereading what I wrote I can see how it comes off as that. He just is easily frustrated, he never hurts our son physically or mentally. By radical punishments I mean threats like taking away all his toys, or not playing outside the rest of the week. Nothing we would be able to follow through with.**

**UPDATE: I found very affordable counseling through my husbands university, I plan on talking to my husband about going, I am nervous to suggest it because and positive comments on how to have that conversation would be appreciated!**"

"My dad[58 M] screwed me [28 M]. My wife [25 F] is pissed, and idk how to proceed.


Back when I was finishing up my freshman year of college, my dad saw my living situation as an investment opportunity. Rather than just pay rent in a college town, he thought it wise to purchase a property, reap the benefits of deductible expenses, rent the rooms, and sell it when it inevitably appreciated in value. He purchased the condo in late 2006, at the height of the market, and I don't need to tell you what happened to the housing market shortly thereafter. However, the kicker is that in order to reap some of those benefits, he needed me to sign on the mortgage in order to qualify it as a primary residence or something. I was 18 at the time, my dad was a good dad that always provided for me, and he was a CPA that is generally really good with money so I signed without giving it much thought.


Fast forward four years, to early 2011ish, and the property is so unbelievably underwater that my dad decides to let it go into foreclosure. My parents' house is paid for, he has enough savings to be liquid, so he doesn't really mind the hit to his credit, and he assures me he will help me out with cash if it hurts my credit.
 

Between now and then, I've gotten married, and my wife and I just started the preliminary process of researching buying a home. Even though I signed the mortgage, it has never shown up on my credit report and I've maintained a credit score of 780+. But in the process of being pre-qualified, it has surfaced and we've been told that we can't get a loan for at least 3 years since the foreclosure was official (June 2016). My wife made some mistakes with credit cards when she was in college and she's building her credit back up, but qualifying through her isn't an option right now.

Ultimately, I trusted my dad as a naive 18 year old and he got burned on an investment that's affecting my life. We've never been all that close, but, I want to reiterate that my dad has always provided for me in any way. I needed a loan back in August which he gave me, and I've been paying it back interest free every month since. But now we're stuck renting for another 2.5 years and my wife is pissed. She thinks my dad only acted in his financial interests (which I agree with) and it's having an unfair effect on our life as a married couple. She said she doesn't want me to pay my dad back any of the money I still owe him, but I don't think I want to get into an ""eye for an eye"" type situation as that could just lead to things getting messy. I just don't know how to tackle this situation. I think I need to have an open and direct conversation about this with both of my parents in the room on my own, but I just don't know. I have always valued my family and I love my wife dearly and I just want to avoid this becoming a wedge between all of us. I can really see this spiraling if it's not approached the right way and I don't want that to happen.

  **tl;dr**: Dad had me sign on a mortgage when I was 18 that has recently foreclosed. Wife is pissed we can't get a loan because of said foreclosure. How do I keep this from being a wedge between my family and me/my wife?"
"[21, F] My boyfriend [24, M] is all over me about working out and being fit and it's killing my confidence.


So i'll give a short backstory here because there is some kind of odd scenario leading to this. My boyfriend was kind of a screw up in highschool and he ended up getting sent to this boot camp type program when he was 17 for breaking into a house. It was one of those where you complete their program and you avoid any jail time when you turn 18. One of their big things was physical fitness and he went from being kind of a typical chubby guy to being very fit, running miles a day, hundreds of pushups, pull ups, etc.

So ever since then he has sworn up and down that his little calisthenics program is a life saver, made him who he is, etc. I always liked how motivated he was and his body looks fantastic so it was always just a win-win as his girlfriend. 

The problem started this year when he talked me into making a new years resolution to get more fit with him. He came up with an easy routine for a beginner to start working out and for the first few weeks it was fine. But over time he really ramped up how hard and how time intense it is. He wants me working out 7 days a week now and usually they take me well over an hour because i'm not strong enough to fly through 150 push-ups like he is.

So anyways, if I ever tell him I can't workout today he gets mad at me. He is the type that thrives on negative motivation, im assuming because of the boot camp background, so he does that with me too. He'll tell me i'm going to be another fat piece of shit in 10 years if I don't finish that set of push ups, or hold the plank the full time, or whatever else. He'll text me pictures or videos while i'm at work of him doing some super tough exercise I can't do (and that are probably not even possible for a woman to do) and say stuff like ""I'm the fucking king, now I need a queen"" or ""i'm getting even further ahead of you"" and stuff like that. He thinks they motivate me but in reality it just makes me feel bad. 

I have had a talk with him about how i'm not trying to be as fit as him and he just brushes that off as me making excuses. I've turned down workouts and he'll just mope and say ""fine, be unhealthy"" or something like that. Basically, he's overboard about his expectations for me and he can't understand that what works to motivate him (telling him he's a piece of shit, or he isnt a real man - he asks me to do that when he's slacking) doesn't work on me and makes me feel bad. Also his bragging about himself makes me feel horrible because he's basically just rubbing it in my face that he is way more attractive than me.

I know this paints a bad picture of him, and in 2017 he has been bad. But we have been together almost 2 years total and I really do love him. I know he loves me too and he wants to help me. He's just not comprehending that he isn't helping and see's any challenge to him as an excuse to be lazy. Have any of you had to deal with a situation like this? Is it something you can come out of and make the other person relax?

TL;DR:

- Boyfriend is a fitness enthusiast 

- I agreed to make a new years resolution to work out and get fit with him.

- He's pushing me way too hard and insulting me to motivate me and it's killing my self confidence
