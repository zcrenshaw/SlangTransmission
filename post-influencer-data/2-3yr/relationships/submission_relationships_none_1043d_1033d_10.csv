"UPDATE: Me [26 M] with my best friend [26 M] of 15 years, what the hell is wrong with him?


**Update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55dbdn/me_26_m_with_my_best_friend_26_m_of_15_years_what/) thread**

So I realized that this couldn't go on and I had to do something. The comments in the thread made me realize why he was doing this, and so one time when we were driving to my house, I led the conversation to social awkwardness, which he has had some problems with. So we started talking about **his** social awkwardness in particular.

This is where I use the opportunity to say: ""Well you got this thing in social settings, though, which really shows that you are struggling in the circumstances""

He asks: ""What thing?""

And I reply: ""You joke a lot. Like with my girlfriend, she can't ask you anything, you just keep cracking constant jokes. It's almost a reflex for you. I think you may do it because you're not sure how to act""

He agreed and he said it's a problem, so we agreed to go to my house to see my girlfriend, with the goal in mind that he wouldn't joke so much.

In the start he was obviously under immense pressure, because we had just been talking about this and he must have been feeling as if I was judging his every move (and perhaps my gf too) so there was a bit of stuttering, where he must have been battling his insecurities deeply inside. But he won that battle because, you know what? He was great that evening. My girlfriend and he had a great conversation and after he left, she told me how great it was to talk to him when he acted normal.

It was really great to open the issue up, because now we can communicate about it freely and work on it.

I'd like to thank you all for your invaluable help. Without it, I would never have realized what to do!

Thank you all for your kind and caring support. Though this all happened today, I have began making my next steps.


I did end my relationship with Jim. The conversation was difficult to have, but it needed to be had. There were questions I needed to ask for my health (such as STIs and such). Though he did say he used protection, I still scheduled an appointment with my doctor for this coming weekend.


*Edit to add this part in [I overheard Jim's phone call with Derek. He told Derek what had happened and ended his relationship with them. He also said he is quitting his work tomorrow. I do feel bad but know that is purely his decision. ]


Jim will be moving back into his parent's place tomorrow. I will be canceling my lease tomorrow morning. I did contact my best friend from back home and simply explained that I will be returning home. He offered to fly up here to help me, but I said no because I know I will break down. Right now, I need to keep strong. Seeing a friend here will only allow myself to break down into a huge mess.


I'm doing my best to stay positive. I keep telling myself, ""Better now than later. Good thing it's only been just a year and not five or more. Think of this as a life lesson. Do not hold grudges and do my best to move forward."" It's hard, I admit, but continuing to tell myself those things helps me. I would love to believe that this experience has not swayed my views on relationships; rather, I would love to believe that this experience and relationship has revealed a little more of myself. I still need to do a lot of reflecting but that can come after I have done all the physical work (moving back to my home state).


Again, everything seems to be happening so fast but it's progress. Thank you all for your kind and loving support. I hope my experience and progress can be of some hope for others. I love my boyfriend extremely and though I did not mention it in the post, I did make a lot more sacrifices for him than he has ever for me. Through all that, I don't see it as losing an investment in someone but rather I am moving on for a healthier opportunity and hopefully he will be able to learn from this as well. I have no plans on getting back together with him. His words were sweet and tempting, but they were poison.


Thank you again :)

* Original Post 


Hi reddit,


I am extremely heart broken and am in need of advice and even comfort. I don't want to use real names so I will be putting in different names. Thank you for understanding.. Let me share with you all on what happened. 


I [25/f] have been dating my boyfriend [23/m] - we will call him Jim, for a year now. It was long distance at first, but I moved to his home state in August so that we can be together physically. Everything was perfect. Jim and I were extremely happy with each other, always communicated, and we were just a happy couple. 

He works at a cafe and there he befriended one of his coworkers [23/m - we will call him Derek]. Derek has been inviting Jim to get a few drinks after work, and the two became good buds. I've met him before and he was really nice. Jim thought he was a cool guy too. Then in mid-October Derek would invite my boyfriend over to his place. They'll just hang, order pizza, and drink some beers apparently (Jim would text me that he would hang out with Derek after work then come home. I never required him to text me where he was, but Jim was always sweet to text me messages throughout the day. I did the same for him too.). Throughout the entire night, Jim would tell me how he met Derek's girlfriend [24/f we will call her Karen] and that they were very nice people. I texted him back that it was awesome and sweet how the two invited him and shared a good time with him. I thought that was just that. 


So Karen and I have never seen each other. All I knew about her was that she was Derek's girlfriend, she was nice, and also I learned that she and Derek moved in together like early October. I thought that was pretty cute. That's all I knew about her. My boyfriend started to hang out at their place more often, and I would only think of it as something as coworkers/friends just hanging out after work. I do admit that I felt left out and even asked Jim if I could hang out with them. He would say it would be a hassle since then he would have to come get me from my work or at home then go to Derek's place and also that they only hang out for a short while. I just would say ""Alright"" and be done with it. 


I had a day off work and texted my boyfriend that I will come over to his work place to have lunch together. He told me that would be awesome so I went. It was pretty busy in there, but not super busy where the workers wouldn't be able to casually talk. I noticed my boyfriend working and one other girl. Between orders, this other girl would be touching Jim's arm and would smile at him. She would act really flirty with him...and my boyfriend seemed totally fine with it. It hurt because 1) he was letting another girl flirt with him and 2) he always felt bothered if I would flirt with him in public - mind you, I'm not all handsy, but I do playfully hug his arm. 


Well Jim didn't notice me in there so I just kept to myself. Until several of the customers walked out, Jim finally noticed me. We went out for lunch, but on our way out I asked him, ""Who is your coworker?"" and he told me it was Karen. I asked him if he found her attractive, and he said word for word ""Honestly, not really. She's not ugly but she's not pretty or anything."" 


I told him how I felt about him and Karen acting that way in the cafe, and he only told me it was meaningless since that's how Karen is. I tried extremely hard to just kill my jealousy, but it really hurt me. I cried in the kitchen after Jim had gone to sleep that night. 

A few days after that event, Jim would be going to Derek's place after work and would come home really late. Earlier today he told me he would be hanging out with Derek again, and with my own insecurities boiling inside me, I asked Jim to stay home with me a few times of the week because we rarely saw each other due to our work schedules. We ended up arguing, and in my anger I snapped at him saying something like, ""Fine then you can go to your little threesome."" His face went pale and just a sick feeling made me believe that what I had said out of anger was actually true. I asked him and he admitted it.

I ultimately found out that my boyfriend has been having a threesome with Derek and his girlfriend after work almost every day since October. I asked Jim if he was bi, but Jim said they were just sharing Karen and it meant nothing - it was only sex. It hurt. A lot. Jim and I shared the same views that an open relationship never could work for us, that sex with another person while in this relationship would be viewed as cheating, and so on (he was the one who set down the ground rules, and I agreed to them - we both were very monogamous). At least I thought. 

I am completely heartbroken. Jim is in the other room just sitting at his desk, and I'm in the bedroom bawling my eyes out while seeking some sort of help from reddit. Honestly, I have no friends here. The friends I have back at home didn't want me to go and we left on bitter terms. I'm ashamed to reach out to them for help. I just can't shake off this feeling of utter disgust and betrayal. I love my boyfriend so much. So very much. A pathetic part of me wants to just work on our relationship, but that is just a horrible choice. I know I should leave him and go back home or whatever.. but right now I'm just in shock.

"I'm (25/M) about to board a plane to London to get my twin sister (25/F) out of a tough spot; seeking advice on how to handle the situation in a that is good for her.


She moved across the country (BC to Ontario) to be with a guy she had met in university. From the start, we all knew he was bad news. He degraded her publicly, so I can only imagine the sorts of things he would say and do to her in private. Being twins, she and I were always really close. But as soon as she got with this guy, our relationship began to suffer. 


When she told me she was going to move, I tried to convince her to stay. She didn't listen. I knew she wouldn't, but I had to try anyway. After she moved, she began to slowly push everyone away. Including me. We were all worried, especially when she changed her number and refused to give us the new one. We still had her on FB so we could see she was alive and (seemingly) well, but I knew in my gut she wasn't happy over there. Eventually, she blocked me and the rest of us on every social media platform. At one point our mom got really worried and considered hiring a PI just to see if she was still alive. 


For nearly three years now, we've all been worried. Our parents haven't had a decent nights rest since she left. I've tried my best to be there for everyone and put up a brave face, but I've been just as scared and just as worried. 


At around eleven o'clock this morning, I got a call from a U.K. number. It was her. My twin. In short, she was crying and she asked if I could come get her. I forgot for a second that she had called from a U.K. number, suddenly realizing she was asking me to come get her ... from the other side of the world. At first I wanted to say no because I have work and commitments here and I can't just drop everything, but the sound of her voice, crying like that and calling after so long, was a clear enough indication to me that she was in a lot of pain. Regardless of how distant she's been these past few years, I'm there for her if she needs me. So now I'm flying out to the U.K. to get her home safely. I very briefly told our parents. My mom is relieved. My dad less so. He thinks my sister got herself into this mess, so she should get herself out. I can see what he means, but if she's trapped in a toxic relationship like that, then no ... the person who's been ignoring us and pushing us away all this time wasn't her. 


Right now she's in a battered women's shelter over there, has no money and was calling from a landline at the shelter. I have the address. I spoke with a lady who works there and we've sorted out the details. My flight is boarding soon. I guess I just want to know what I should expect. What I should do in case of resistance, in case she suddenly decides she wants to go back to him, which I know can happen in cases like this. 


Oh and just to clarify, the guy is English. They met here in Vancouver, moved to Toronto soon after, and then moved to London, England at some point after she cut off communication with us. 


TL;DR - My twin sister called me from a women's shelter across the world and asked me come get her. I'm on my way. Seeking advice on what to expect and how to treat the situation in a way that's most helpful to her. "

My little brother almost. My dad was unemployed at the time. My brother and I are in middle school, and my brother was staying behind at school with his friend Ashley. Ashley wanted his help with something. Ashley left with her mom and my dad was picking up my brother. My dad had been drinking all day at home. They crashed and my brother almost died from the amount of blood he lost. 

My brother survived thank god. It was probably the worst time in my family. My mom divorced my dad and got full custody of us. It was really open and shut. The judge was having none of my father and my mothers lawyer ate him alive. My mother and I left California and we moved to Arizona. My little brother is still struggling with his recovery. He just has alot of scaring and his leg is recovering. He needs to wear this brace when he walks around. 

My Aunts, Uncles and Cousins are blaming my brother. They are all my dads side of the family. They told mom and I that if he never asked to be picked up this would not have happened. It was raining, it's the only reason he asked to be picked up. I need to know what to do about them. They are still in California, but they want to come see us for Christmas.

"My [27F] husband's [28M] friend's [27F] boyfriend [2?M] told me he thinks their relationship is inappropriate. Not sure what to do about this.


My husband's friend's boyfriend (everybody got that?) told me he thinks their relationship is inappropriate.

Background: my husband ""Dave"" has been friends with ""Lily"" since college. Lily has become kind of my friend too, but she is more Dave's friend. I've never suspected anything inappropriate going on between them. They act more like squabbling siblings than anything else. 

Lily has been dating ""Mike"" for about six months now. I've met him a few times, he was okay, but very quiet. He never said much directly to me, until he sent me a facebook message telling me that he thought Lily and Dave's relationship was inappropriate. He didn't directly say he thought they were cheating, but I'm assuming he wouldn't have contacted me if he didn't think that.

The problems he had seemed kind of stupid to me. I don't know his life story, maybe he has been cheated on before, but none of the stuff he brought up seemed suspicious at all. For example, at a Halloween party, Lily got fake cobweb stuck in her hair. She tried to pick it out, but was having trouble with the back of her head. Dave was next to her, so he was able to casually reach over and grab the cobweb out. I saw the whole thing, it wasn't like he was tenderly stroking her hair, and it wasn't sexy or intimate at all. I guess she could have asked Mike for help, but Dave was standing right there and it look ten seconds.

He also had an issue with the fact that Lily didn't call him for help after she had minor surgery. I'm not even sure they were officially a couple at this time, I think I remember her telling us some time after the surgery was over. If they were a couple, it was brand new. It makes sense that you would not want a guy you have just started seeing and trying to impress in a state like that. Instead, she asked a few friends to rotate shifts staying with her until she was fully awake. She did ask Dave, but he took a turn with other people also, so its not even like she chose him above all others. I stopped by for a little because he was bored, since his only job was to look in on her every so often to make sure she wasn't dead. She was asleep most of the time, and the one time she woke up, she looked like a zombie. Nothing happened. There were a few other things, also all minor. Maybe I just have different tolerance levels than he does, but I really can't see what was wrong with any of this.

If it were anyone else, I'd tell them to stop over analyzing things and mind their own business. But *if* Lily was cheating, it is his business. I think he's massively overreacting. My problem is that on the one hand, it might be best to just reassure him that these are normal things and nothing to worry about, and avoiding getting all involved in someone else's relationship. But on the other hand, I am worried that being so upset over such innocuous things means he is not reasonable, and is a red flag. If so, I would want to tell Lily, or probably have Dave do it. Do you think I am overreacting at thinking that this is really weird? How would you suggest I try to reassure someone like this that nothing is wrong? Should I even bother talking to him?

"My[15/M] Mum's[47/F] Partner [60M] has been diagnosed with cancer and everyone is getting angry at me.


First before we start a little backstory:


My Mum cheated on my Dad about twelve years ago, the result of this was my half sister who is eleven and me being forced to live with my Mum, even thou i would much rather live with my Dad.


Currently I live with my mum and my sister, who i both dislike, its not like I'm being abused or mistreated or anything like that its just that my mum isn't a good mum, she cares for me sure but never supports me emotionally or in any work i have to do or ever helps me in general really and I'm finding it hard to cope with everything that i have on my plate. Again its not that she is a bad person its just I really don't get along with her.


Anyway My mother's partner has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and they reckon its been in his system for around 2 years. Since the diagnosis My mum has been understandably really upset along with her side of the family. Of course i would prefer it if none of this was happening and they could all be happy but that's just not how things work.


My mum has been with her partner for around 2 years and throughout that whole time I've probably spoken to him for around 15 minuets. And because i barely even know him I'm not really upset about the bad news. I'm still feel sad due to the whole situation but I wouldn't say i was upset. Since I'm not crying about it all the time or mourning over the bad news my Mum's side of the family have been treating me like some emotionless monster that doesn't care about anyone. I've tried supporting my mum but in the end they're getting angry that i'm not upset, I'm not prepared to pretend to be upset over something I'm not.


What do you guys think i could do to improve the situation?


feel free to ask more questions about the situation.


TL;DR My family is getting angry that I'm not upset over My mother's partners cancer.

Edit(My mum cheated on my dad probably before then, It when i was young I cant really remember)

Edit2 (turns out i forgot the definition for half sister, used step sister instead, whoops)

"My (21F) landlady/housemate(40s/F) let her son and his gf (25ish/M&amp;F) sleep in my room while I was away.


Hey guys! I need help on broaching a problem with my landlady/housemate.

I rent a room from a couple I have known for a couple of years. I've been living with them just over a month. Angelina is lovely, generous, kind and generally a great person to live with. She charges fair rent and the room she rented me is beautifully furnished. I cannot complain at all. Her partner Dave is great too. Dave has three kids from a previous relationship that come over at weekends sometimes. I knew this before moving in and I was cool with it cos it's only weekends and the youngest is 12 so they really don't disturb me. Plus they're nice kids. Also the house has five bedrooms so there's plenty of space for everyone. Angelina also has 4 sons from a previous relationship. One of them, Norman, lives a few hours' drive away.

Anyway, last week I went away for a week to see my boyfriend. We are in a long-distance relationship. Angelina was super nice and lent me a suitcase and offered to pick me up from the bus station when I got back (tonight). On the drive home she told me that Norman and his girlfriend had stayed in my room while I was away, and that she'd had to move some of my dirty laundry so they didn't see it. I was not asked about this in advance. I was so shocked I just didn't say anything and mortified about her touching my dirty laundry. I make sure my room is clean when anyone's going to come in it but I'd left the house at 5.30am to make my coach and then flight and since I was going to be away for a week I NATURALLY assumed nobody would go in my room, closed the door and just left it a mess. I'm now glad I didn't leave anything more intimate lying around...

I'm pretty pissed off and feel invaded. I am a university student and the reason I decided to rent from an older couple and not live with other students is that I hate the lack of privacy and the forced socialisation that comes with student accomodation. I am a very private, introverted person who needs a lot of alone time and really hates people getting all up in her business. This crossed a massive line for me and I feel super uncomfortable but Angelina just talked about it like it was no big deal.

Also, the house has FIVE FUCKING BEDROOMS which ALL have double beds. When Dave's kids are over at weekends, it's rare that all three of them come over at once. And even if they did the girls could share a room! There's absolutely no reason at all anyone should use my  bedroom and also my private bathroom which had been used, but I'm less bothrered by that.

I pay rent. Usually when people pay rent it doesn't mean that their landlords can use their rented home as a hotel for their family whenever the tenant goes away. If this was an apartment it would be totally out of line. How do I know they didn't go snooping through my stuff? I feel totally mortified and embarrassed that they saw all the mess in my room.

I need to nip this behaviour in the bud because I'm going to be away for a month at Christmastime. But I also don't want to damage the great relationship I have with Angelina and Dave. How do I broach this tactfully? Just the thought of her moving my dirty underwear around has me a horrible mix of furious and mortified. I want to set some clear boundaries so that this doesn't happen again.

"My [32M] girlfriend [35F] has just been told she is going through menopause and can't have children. How can I best support her in the next few days?


Throwaway account as I just want to reduce the risk of getting back to my main reddit account right now. 

My girlfriend of 3 years has been seeing a doctor over the last few months as she hadn't had her period - she went to see some specialists for tests and last week she was informed she may be menopausal (or as it's below 40 years old,  premature ovarian failure). She got her test results back today and the worst is confirmed - she has slim to no chance of having children. When this was a possibility last week, I told her that I'd support her no matter what and this is a blow, but we have other options for children if the news was bad. We had talked about adopting and other options before - we both wanted to have biological children but even before this were open to the idea of adopting, fostering and other parenting options so it wasn't like I just went ""oh shit, adoption it is!""

She got the news earlier and I'm home from work now, I told her that the weekend is absolutely hers and I'd be here to support and help her as she needs, she just needs to let me know. We had a brief chat and hug before and I just reminded her that this doesn't change anything for me and that we, her especially, just need to take time and think - but regardless of the situation I love her and I'm here for her. She said she just needed some space and time alone and I understand that.

Sorry for the messy post, I guess I'm just asking here for advice from anyone who has went through a similar situation - both as the partner or as a woman - as to how I can be best here for her in the next few days?

"I (23/F) recently trained a woman (??/F) to replace me after I got promoted, but I'm afraid she's a liability.


I graduated college about a year and a half ago and am still very new to the workforce and navigating work relationships. I had two jobs with HORRIBLE workplace cultures before I landed at my current company, and was just promoted out of reception about a month ago.

My company hired a woman to replace me through the same temp agency I used to work with. I spent a full week sitting at the front desk with her, showing her the basics like who gets which phone calls, how to transfer those calls, going through the mail, etc. It's a pretty easy gig, but she's been making a lot of little mistakes that my coworkers and I have had to keep correcting in the month that she's been here. I try to be patient and understanding, but it's horribly frustrating to keep repeating yourself and feel like the other person isn't listening.

My biggest issue with her, though, is the fact that she also has been over-reaching and assisting clients with things that she is **not** qualified to do. At the risk of losing anonymity, I will say that I work at a health insurance company. It's a huge liability for someone to assist a patient with claims, coverage, or enrollment if they are not authorized to do so. 

I have spoken with her, two of my coworkers have spoken with her, and my supervisor has spoken with her. She will not listen and continues to help patients with things that she herself does not fully understand. We have tried to take it to HR and have her replaced, but they're hesitant to get rid of anyone (even if she is through a temp agency).

I'm at a loss, and I'm afraid I'll be blamed for anything she seriously fucks up because I was the one who trained her. How do I a) protect myself, and b) stop her from over-reaching?

TL;DR - My replacement is not qualified to do anything beyond light reception work and barely manages that, but keeps going out of her way to ""help"" clients. I'm afraid of the inevitable fallout.

"I(21) got an interview for a makeup place that my friend(20) also wanted and now she upset with me. Should I not go?


Hello, I need advice. 
I'm 21 and work two jobs, both fast food and I hate it. A lot. 
I love this makeup store that I shop at and not to toot my own horn but I'm pretty great at makeup. Like I go all out everyday. 
Well, the store is hiring so me and my friend put in applications. 
My friend barely pulls $400 from her job monthly and I've offered her temporary jobs at both my jobs that would pay more but she's refused. 
I got a call back and she didn't. She's LIVID. Saying how everyone else is doing great and nobody ever calls her back and how she can't even afford rent. I brought up me offering her those jobs and she went off saying how she's tired of working food and how she wants to move up so I told her ""So do I, but I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my head above water and so should you."" Then I told her to walk in and talk to them like I did and now she's saying she can't do it until tomorrow and other excuses. 
It's pissing me off because I was so happy about this and now she's making me feel like I stole something from her just because she doesn't have a car or the motivation to do what I do. I'm debating on just telling them I'm not interested and recommending her instead. 

Update: Me and her have talked it out. She apologized for being jealous and told me it's due to her barely pulling $400 a month at her current job and that she sees me always going and doing and not worrying about bills because I work two jobs. I told her she still has so much to be hopeful for and that I'd do anything to help her out if need be because she's like a sister to me. 
I'm going to the interview Monday and ive already ironed my outfit and know EXACTLY how bomb my face is going to look. My dream is to be a cosmetologist and this is my foot in the door! 
I didn't think think this would blow up the way it did, thank you for the replies! 
Btw, I will try and get her a job there if I can, she deserves something like this to bring her up. 
 

Tldr; My friend and I put in applications for the same job, I got the call back and she didn't. Should I skip the interview?"
"How do I [26F] tell my boyfriend that I used to be a cult member and that's how I got my scars?


When I was 18 I joined a cult. It wasn't a ""let's sit in the woods and smoke weed"" cult, it was exactly what you expect from a very serious cult. I was moved to a foreign country where the cult operated, every second of every day was spent with the cult for all members, rituals that were performed most days and a lot of them were extremely abusive and almost torturous. I stayed there until I was 22 and then ran away and came back, changed my name and now live somewhere new.

I have a lot of scars and markings on my body as a result. I will get rid of them with plastic surgery but I can't afford it yet. I've been with my boyfriend (27M) for 4 months now and he's obviously noticed them on my body and asked about them, so far all I told him was that I'm not ready to talk about it and I will when I'm ready but in reality I'm just afraid of freaking him out.

How do I tell him something like this about my past?

"[UPDATE] I [20f] can't get over my jealousy of my so [27m] and his newish friend [20sf]


Hi again,

My previous post (https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58f4sl/i_20f_cant_get_over_my_insecurity_of_my_so_27m/) didn't blow up or anything but I am so grateful to everyone who responded, you all helped me feel like my feelings were valid. Thank you.

A few days after I posted, I had really been thinking about what exactly I wanted to say to him. I had been texting with Kyle and saw he posted on Instagram of him at a bar. Later, in the things friends like, I saw a video taken from the same bar and guess who posted it? Meg. So I was sure they were together and he hadn't told me so I resolved to talk to him the next time I saw him. I met up the next day with him and a friend and casually asked him about his day, really hoping he'd mention it. He listed the stuff he did (went Halloween shopping, bowling, to the bar and then to the movies) and didn't mention Meg. I was so mad but kept it together until later.

I waited until the morning and talked to him about it. It was a very long talk, but I stayed calm for most of it and I felt like I was as clear as I possibly could have been. I told him that we had discussed this on two separate occasions where it had clearly bothered me and that his behavior was incredibly untrustworthy. As I had guessed, not only did he go to the bar with Meg but everything he'd dome that day had been with her. 

During this, I found out that she had been over to his apartment alone and on one occasion she and his guy friend slept over after a night out. Hearing that made me want to puke. He said he couldn't just let a hammered friend go home, it wouldn't be safe. I told him that he could call her an uber in the future. 

Also I told him I needed to be told when he hung out with her, because otherwise I would find out on my own and feel betrayed. 
He told me the reason he didn't mention her or introduce me that one time is because he knew it upset me and he didn't want me to get upset and start a fight. 

Here's the thing, he has so many female best friends. If that weren't the case, I don't think I would have bought this but since he does, I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I said I'd believe him when he said nothing was going on but I needed him to be honest about it and I wanted to meet her the next time it could happen casually. He said of course, he loved me, he was sorry he had turned it into something that it wasn't etc.

And honestly things felt great for a bit! Like I was so relaxed and happy....

Then this past weekend.. Went to a friends party. It was a really big party but the whole time he wouldn't really talk to me or dance with me and for a lot of it, I didn't know where he was. I made do, but felt weird since I was getting hit on by a bunch of strangers and had hoped to hang out with him for part of it! We wound up getting into a fight about that and other things the following day.

I felt like I'd been a hungover asshole so I wrote him a love letter and went over to apologize. 
He was still really mad, told me he didn't think he wanted to be with me and fell asleep.
I was crying and I'm really ashamed to say this but I went on his phone. I looked at his texts with her. I didn't find any evidence of blatant emotional cheating, but a lot of stuff really hurt me. First, it didn't look anything like his texts to his other friends, a lot of triple texting etc. and

- They'd hung out a LOT more than I'd previously thought, INCLUDING texts about going to the party we went to and dancing together. So now I know where he was when I couldn't find him. 

 -She'd left her bag at his house the time he told me she'd just ""stopped in to use the bathroom."" Hmm...
 
- They swapped poetry back and forth, not poetry about each other but things they'd written which stung because he never shows me his writing. 

- Also there were a lot of occasions when she'd ask him what he was up to,  when he was with me and he would omit that fact and tell her he was with friends or running errands! Sounds familiar... The one one time he mentioned me was after we talked the last time, and she was all on board with going out with a group of us but after the text where he mentioned me she changed her mind about going. 

And then Kyle woke up, caught me on his phone, yelled at me and shoved me + all my shit out the door at 3am. 


So we're done, and I'm heartbroken and fucking mortified that I stooped that low when I could have just left with my dignity intact a couple weeks ago. But honestly, I think unless I caught them fucking I would have kept making excuses and rationalizing his behavior for him and forgiving him for everything until the end of time, so in a way I think it's good I did something so shitty and burned the bridge. 

**tl;dr:** tried to fix it, wound up snooping and seeing more weird stuff, got caught snooping and now we are like, so over. :( 

edit: oh gosh, thank you so much to everybody who took time out of their day to read this. I feel really bad about what I did and don't ever want to repeat it in the future, but hearing that things will get better on an emotional level means so much to me right now. "
"I [23f] have a strong gut instinct there's something off about my boyfriend [29m].


[removed]"
"My grandpa [89M] thinks I'm [16M] turning into a ""sissy"" and blames my mother [50F] for it.


Just a bit of background: I have two older brothers, 28 and 26. They are technically my half-brothers, because we have the same father but different mothers. They are both very much ""manly men"" and are both in the military. They are also very athletic and enjoy sports such as hunting and rugby. My grandfather (father's father) fought in World War II and is a real tough guy, the kind that takes no shit from anybody. He also has a rather old-fashioned world view and raised my father and uncles to his ideal. He is also very outspoken and speaks his mind. His jokes sometimes cross the line between ""funny"" and ""offensive"".

On the other hand, I'm very different from them. I guess my mother DID kind of spoil me when I was growing up, and was a bit over-protective of me, and I didn't really do any of the things which they did when they were young. Instead of fishing and playing rugby and hunting, I stayed at home and learned the violin. Instead of going to the schools which they went to, I was a chorister at a church from the ages of 8 to 13. Since then, my grandfather would always tease me and call me ""princess"" or the feminine version of my name. He would always encourage my father [62M] to take me out hunting, like a ""real man"".

Well, that happened once. I remember it vividly. The two of them (dad and granddad) took me out deer hunting when I was about 12. I followed them as they stalked and eventually gunned down a large doe. It was the first time I had ever witnessed an animal dying and I was so traumatized that I threw up and started crying. My father was in a hurry to get me home, and while my grandfather was worried at first, he started to rag on me on the way back. He teased me and called me an over-sensitive sissy. He and my mother had an argument over it. She accused my grandfather of ""pushing me too hard"", and he accused HER of being overprotective and allowing me to be so sensitive.

Now, I'm in high school. I'm on the school rugby team, but it's not something I really enjoy. I'd rather play the violin or golf than rugby (which I've broke several bones from). I guess you can say that I'm rather ""effeminate"" in that I care about my grades, the way I look, the clothes I wear, etc. I'm also bi, but I haven't come out yet, and frankly, I don't think I ever would. My grandfather gives me enough crap as it is.

The actual incident happened yesterday. As with every week, my family and I were having supper at my grandparent's house. My grandmother asked me how school was going. I told her it was going well. My grandfather asked me whether I was thinking of joining the military after high school, like my brothers had done. I told him that I was actually thinking of going to university to study law and become a lawyer. He huffed and was like, ""So you think the army is too good for you, princess?"" I was like no, I didn't think it was ""too good"" for me, I just didn't think that it was the right option. And then he went, ""Yeah, a pretty boy like you wouldn't last a day in there.""

My father then chimed in and told his dad to give it a rest. But my grandfather still continued. He was like, ""The problem is, [my dad's name], you've allowed your wife to turn your son into a little lady, prancing about in his designer clothes and expensive cologne."" He then went on about how when he was my age, he was sleeping in hard bunks in a military school and taking cold showers, blah blah blah. And then the kicker was when he said something about how he ""wouldn't be surprised if I turned out to be gay."" That's when my mother lost it. She told my grandfather in a hard voice that he was being silly and old-fashioned, that she would never let me join the military like a ""mindless sheep"" and that what I did with my life was none of his business whatsoever. She actually started to YELL at him, which was pretty surprising considering the fact that nobody had ever dared raised their voice to my grandfather, not even my grandmother.

She was going on about how I was her son, not his, and he replied with ""Thank God he's not my son!"" At that point I actually thought my mother would throw something at him, but my father interjected and told them both to calm down. The rest of supper was awkward, to say the least. My brothers tried steer the conversation towards something else, but the tension was still there. After supper, my parents and I went back home. My grandfather didn't even see us off. On the phone, my grandmother later apologized to my mother and I for his behaviour. I assured her that I wasn't offended by it.

My mother is still angry at my grandfather, and my father promised her that he would try to ""reign him in"". I'm not sure what to do though. I feel like I've been caught up in the center of their argument. Despite how annoyed I am at my grandfather's narrow view of the world, a part of me still seeks his approval. I just wish that he would be proud of me, like he is of my older brothers. I wish he could see that although I may not be good at hunting or flying helicopters or sports like they are, I'm still good at other things, like debating and playing the violin. I know that he loves me, or at least my father assures me that he does, but I just wish that I could have him understand that there's nothing wrong with me, that just because I'm more ""effeminate"" than my older brothers, I could still turn out to be a successful man.

TL;DR: From a young age, I've always been interested in things like music and literature, in contrast with my manlier older brothers. My grandfather accuses my mother of raising me to be effeminate. I just wish that he could be proud of me and acknowledge the fact that times are different and that being a ""man"" doesn't mean joining the military or liking sports."

"Co-workers [30 M] [35 M] [62 M] [64 M] will not stop commenting on my [28 F] clothing/hair/every move. I want them to stop.


I've been employed at the same business for almost 2 years now. The position I hold is notoriously high earning. (This is just common knowledge with the position in the industry - I have not disclosed this to anyone personally). I'm the last to leave every day and work very hard for my team. I have 8 years of experience in my field and love the job that I do.  


In the beginning these gentlemen were gentlemen. Everyone was cordial and we took part in polite office banter. Given the industry I work in I don't expect much, but basic respect isn't too much to ask. I don't believe I've created this problem as I am not much for visiting. I will chat and joke with my co-workers in passing without ever getting too personal.  


Lately, I cannot enter the perimeter without a comment about my: shoes, clothes, hair, make-up, jewelry, even the way I walk etc.  Its never-ending. Its **daily**.  I dress professionally, am clean and well-kept and have never welcomed this behaviour. For example, *""I liked your pants better yesterday. Those ones are no good."" ""Where did you even get that (insert item of clothing here)?"" ""Run. Run. Run. Clip-clop!"" ""Wow that lipstick is something else.""* Its constant.  


Now I understand when working with men, you have to have a sense of humour - I can take a joke. Its gone from comments here and there, to daily narration of almost everything I do. I have to walk by a couple of their desks on the way to my office and they will mimic my steps by stomping their feet every time I pass. **Every time**.


I've stood up for myself in the past and asked them why they would say/do these things to me and there's been apologies but it boomerangs after a couple days of peace. Lately I will keep walking and pretend I didn't hear. I don't know if these men have issues with a younger female in a higher earning position than they are or if they are intimidated but I want it to stop.  


I know I'll be told to speak to HR, but  I want to handle this myself if at all possible.  I would not like to cause a scene at my job and consider myself to be a no maintenance employee.

"Me [21 M] with my best friends [21 M] of 5-10 years, are hanging out with the person who assaulted me


I would like to start this off with,

about 1-2 years ago, my brother and i was attacked by a gang of people (around 30 people) for no reason, my brother was stabbed 4-5 times and i was bashed badly.

We found out who the people were a few days later, but were warned our house would be raided by them if we told the police, so we didn't.

Fast forward, two years later. I have a group of friends, and I found out recently, two of them hangout with the guy who stabbed my brother.

Should I be angry, even though they know what that motherf*cker did to me and my brother, they still decide to be friends with him? Because he is 'Nice' to them?

I know I don't own my friends or anything, but do I have the right to feel this way..?

It's hard for me to make friends, the group of 5-6 guys we are all tight friends, and i don't know what to do.

"*Update* Me [26 M]with my wife [25 F] of 1.5 years together 3.5, she cheated about a year into our relationship and just confessed.


Link to the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/56z72o/me_26_mwith_my_wife_25_f_of_15_years_together_35/)

Sorry for any errors formatting on a phone sucks. So my original post wasn't too terribly popular but I like updates so here we go. 

My wife was open and willing to do the paternity test on our son since the cheating was within a few months of us conceiving. I am ecstatic to say that he is within 99.9% certainty mine! That was a massive hurdle for the health of our damaged marriage. 

We have since been going to MC every other week and working on our trust issues... well my trust issue. There wasn't much I could do as far as digging since it happened over two years ago I have all of our texts saved on my phone and I couldn't even scroll all the way back to that time without my phone glitching out.

She has maintained complete transparency through our our marriage and has continued to do so after her confession. She seems remorseful to me she is willing to talk and listen when I'm struggling. It seems that she is by and far more upset at herself than I am at her. 

I'm sure you can tell by the tone that we are headed down the path of rebuilding our marriage. I'm sorry that this story doesn't have the justice that this sub loves but I believe we can have a happy family moving forward and there is zero tolerance for shady behavior moving forward. We have had many discussions about this. 

Thank you to all who PM me and those who had constructive responses to my situation! 

**EDIT: I understand that it's frustrating and honestly hard to grasp why a person would not just up and leave a cheater. I have many times in my life had no problems leaving a cheater. It's sad to me that because I believe my wife is behaving in a way that makes me confident she won't cheat again, that it creates an indictment on my self esteem. It's alright to not understand it why I'm doing what I am but don't try and tear me down further in hopes of convincing me to leave.

  **tl;dr**: Paternity test was positive I am the father. With the help of MC and transparency we are going to stay together and work on our marriage. "

[removed]"
"My [33F] mom [62F] has told me she's cutting off contact with me because I was unwelcoming to her.


My mom and her husband [75M] decided last week to make a trip to my city which is about 900 miles from their city.  The reason for the trip has to do with my sister [20F] who lives in a nearby town with her husband in his grandmother's home.  They asked if they could spend a few nights with me and I said they could.  The plan was for them to get into town Wednesday night around dinner time and spend Wednesday night and Thursday night with me and leave Friday.  

Wednesday I was feeling sick at work and came home around 11.  I went to bed and took medicine hoping to get it together before my mom was due to arrive.  At 12:30-ish there was a knock at my door and I (half asleep) ignored it.  It was my mom and she just walked in (I usually leave the door unlocked) and called my name.  I came out of the bedroom and asked my mom what she was doing there so soon and she got very offended.  She asked if I had a bed ready for them because they were tired as they had gotten up at 3 (from the motel they got midway between our cities) to drive in.  I hesitated because I was groggy and also didn't remember if there were clean sheets on my son's bed yet (they were to stay in his room, I gave him the nicer sheets that morning and told him to change the bed but hadn't verified that he'd done it) but I did say ""yes, I think so"".  She says my tone was disrespectful and she can tell I don't really want them there, I try to explain that I'm just sick and surprised, she leaves.  I call her about 20 minutes later to ask wtf and reiterate that there is a bed for them.  She says they decided to get a motel, I ask if they are still coming to dinner, they say yes.

So at 4 I'm sick enough that I don't think I should cook for people.  I call to ask my mom where she would like me to take her and her husband for dinner.  She is still upset that I didn't say I was happy to see her earlier and says she's not coming over if I don't want her to.  I say I want to see her, the kids want to see her, but I don't want to cook.  She finally agrees to come over and says that they'll  follow me to a restaurant if I really won't cook.  She comes over at the agreed upon time and then gets upset when I say it's time to go to the restaurant but she does follow me, I buy them dinner.  Her husband literally says one word to me the whole night.  

This morning I'm feeling better and I call to see if they'd like to make plans for tonight and even spend the night and my mother says that this is the last time she's going to deal with me because I made her feel like garbage.  I remind her that I said she could stay with me and she says that she knows I don't mean it.  I'm hurt and confused.  It is kind of a big deal for me to have people over (my mother and my husband's sister are the only family that has ever spent the night, my dad and stepmom always get a motel or stay with my aunt when they are in town to see me) because I have a large family  (four kids) and am self-conscious of my messy house (I do my best but it's a lot to keep up with) but to me that makes it more special that I was willing to have my mom stay here.

Tl;dr my mom showed up early and walked into my house and caught me off guard, says that she won't bother ""dealing with"" me anymore because I made her unwelcome.  "
