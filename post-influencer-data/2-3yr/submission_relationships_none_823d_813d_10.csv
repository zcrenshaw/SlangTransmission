"Update: I [30F] found my friend's [30F] fiance's [30M] Tinder profile. They have been dating for 2-3 years and are are getting married in 30 days.


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6fwlif/i_30f_found_my_friends_30f_fiances_30m_tinder/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)

After hanging out with Annie for four hours this weekend, I mustered up the courage to tell her about Finnick's Tinder profile. I told her that I didn't want her to think I was implying anything, but that if it were me, I would want to know, and I thought she would want to know, too.

She already knew. Not because they're in an open relationship, but because he had been having a three month texting ""affair"" with a girl last year. After that girl found out about Annie, she wrote Finnick a letter about how brokenhearted she was, then Finnick 'fessed up to Annie.

Annie said she doesn't really considering it cheating, and that's fine, because it's her relationship and so she and Finnick get to determine the dealbreakers.

I think she was a little concerned, though, because apparently he told her that he had deactivated/deleted his account, and that clearly didn't happen. She texted him when we were together and told him that someone else had found his profile. He apologized and swore that he didn't have the app downloaded but that he would go ahead and make sure his account is deactivated.

I don't know how many people were really looking for an update, but I did get helpful advice on my last post and I really appreciated everyone's input.

"Update: A girl (18/19?) from school asked me (18M) to go to an Halloween party with her. I'm short (5'4) and she is a head taller than me and I have no idea why she would randomly ask me out


[My original post:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58qbac/a_girl_1819_from_school_asked_me_18m_to_go_to_an/)
  
I (18M) took everyone's advice and gave her a call. We went to the Halloween party and had a great time. I was a construction worker which I know is lame but I had to throw something together at the last minute because I wasn't planning on going out anywhere. She was a ballerina. We had a great time and have been together ever since. Saturday was 8 months to the day of the day she asked me out.

She (18F) is 5'10 but honestly I forget about the height difference half the time when I am with her. She has never brought up my height in a negative way. I mean we both tease each other about the other's height but never in a bad way. She feels the same way about her height as I do. We are both freshman and are from the same city a few hours from here. 

All the advice and PM's from everyone was so great, I just wanted to come back and give an update. I feel so much better these days and I don't even care if people make cracks about my height. She is a great person and we have fun together. We went out on Saturday and she wore heels. She told me she hates wearing heels because of how guys reacted but she looked awesome and I told her so. She told me she was so nervous about asking me out she felt like throwing up. I told her it was a blur and I couldn't believe it happened. She has as much experience with guys as I did with girls (none) but I find that hard to believe though she says the same about me. We're enjoying being together and both of us are more confident from it. It's funny because neither of our roommates / friends believed either one of us when we said we had a date. We get along with each other's friend groups too which is nice. 

Thanks to everyone who helped!

TL;DR: I called her. We went to the Halloween party and had a blast and have been together ever since. Saturday was 8 months to the day since she gave me her number and asked me out. I have so much more confidence now.

EDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD!"

"Me (35F) with our office intern (22F). How do I politely let her know that her antics are inappropriate in an office setting?


Hello Reddit. Obvious throwaway because who knows if she's around.

I've acquired an intern for the summer. I've had little experience with interns, she was brought over as a favor granted to someone in a higher floor than I. Office politics, she's related to a Vice President of purchasing and they want her here all summer long. My boss said ok and handed her to me. 

My job is enough for one, but not for two, and there's only so much she can learn without doing. The databases and info I deal with is confidential, and cannot be accessed without a license and security clearance. So in short, there's not a whole lot to do. As a result of this issue, I am constantly asking others in our office for random jobs that she can do. Everyone has been great so far, but I really need help addressing some problems I've seen.

This girl has absolutely no boundaries. There is no respect given to anyone in the office, regardless of position, or seniority. 

She will announce to anyone that asks that she's here by request from the VP, and sees it as leverage over others. 

She's a terrible gossip. This girl knows more about the inner workings of the company than I do with nearly 12 years in. 

She's very personal with all of our staff, making inappropriate jokes and comments that offend many. I'm constantly apologizing for this girl.  

And lastly, small as it seems, I'm chained to this girl every day. Which means bathroom breaks are together, mealtimes are taken together...and she chews with her fucking mouth open and I can't stand it anymore. 

My direct supervisor has told me that there's nothing I can do, I'm going to have to do this until late July. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can make work easier for the next month and a half? How do I correct behavior gently so as to not anger the VP, her parent? 

Help, Reddit. I'm slowly going mad. I've recently come back from maternity leave and the extra stress combined with new motherhood is leaving me a little overwhelmed. 

Tl;dr: I have an intern that has no social skills or manners and is related to a bigwig in the office. I need help and advice on how to cope and correct behaviors. "

I've been with my husband for six years, married for two. We've previously discussed having children and it was always said we'd be happy with or without them. 

I'm starting to get to a point of wanting one... but I think he wouldn't be a great father. I know he'd love any child, but I honestly don't think he'd help parent. 

At times, he's incredibly childish, like he won't stop playing video games when I'm trying to have a serious talk with him. He'll pause for a minute, then start side eyeing the screen, then resume before the conversation is finished. 

He'd want to be a stay at home dad, but even if he did take care of a child all day, I know that he'd immediately turn the child over to me when I got home from work.

Children are difficult at the best of times, but I'm scared to do this and it go horribly.

"Fiancee's [27/F] therapist has asked that I [26/M] take measures into my own hands. Not sure how I feel about this. Is this unprofessional?


My fiancee ""Lina"" constantly puts herself down, to the point where it can be tragic. Lina works at a bakery and is a very talented baker with a great company who really likes her. She's extremely good looking, she's fit, funny, smart, caring and talented. She's patient and easy going... but she hates herself. Because her father hates her. 

Lina is Hispanic and is darker than her siblings &amp; father and similar to what her mother looked like. Her mother died before I came along and her father raised her for the last few years of high school. The man is, to put it bluntly, a f*king d*ck. He likes me because I'm Caucasian and upper middle class. When I told him I wanted to marry his daughter, he apologized to me, and said ""free to a good home."" If Lina is visiting, he finds little flaws to nitpick. Despite being fit, he'll grab her stomach and say ""ohh, fatty."" He'll question whether she's showered and worst of all, comments on her skin tone. The rest of her family is very light skinned (you wouldn't necessarily know they were Hispanic) where as Lina looks a bit darker. But, who cares? She's gorgeous! Not to her father. 

Here's how things go on a daily basis. She gets up and leaves for work at about 5:30. She works until 3:00 and then comes home. She cooks an entire gourmet meal, has it ready for when I get home at around 6:30. I will study till 10:00 when we'll get into bed and cuddle/watch TV till 10:45 and then I fall asleep. ***If*** her father calls during the day: I come home and the gourmet meal is ""probably garbage"" and she's a fuck-up. She'll compulsively smell her hair and pits to make sure she doesn't offend at the table, then sits alone in the bedroom. I'll come to bed and she'll be as stiff as a rail, laying there not paying attention. She'll ""sleep"" (pace around) and then go to work. 

When we can get her mind off her father, she's fun-loving and such a total goofball. It's wild. I love those days, because it's just so fun and unguarded. We'll have passionate sex or just totally be free. 

Lina has been in therapy for 2+ years but it hasn't made a bit of difference. I even attended a few sessions at the request of the therapist. This weekend, we were at an outdoor event and Lina was having her fun-loving day. She was laughing and playing games and stuffing food into her face. Her therapist watched from a distance and made her way to me. When Lina went to the bathroom, she pulled me aside and very casually told me that I need to get her to go NC with her father. There was no other way. She said to find a way to do it and she'll manage the therapy side. She walked off and that was that. 

Thing is, she does need to go NC with her dad. She keeps in contact because it's her last vestige of her mom, whom she misses terribly. When we got engaged, she took a photo of the ring and tied it to a balloon and brought it to her grave so she could see. I feel bad helping author the break-up of her and her father, but I feel like it's ultimately the right thing to do.

On one hand, I get what's right. On the other, I feel like I'm overstepping my boundaries. If you all were in my position, would you do what the therapist asked and engineer an end to this?

"My [29 F] parents [50sM/F] are full on ghosting me?


So I've always been the least favourite child in my family. I was a below-to-average child and my sister was a goddam genius. Guess who was the pride of the family, woo-hoo!

But while I still felt that while there was blatant favouritism with my sister, I still enjoyed a semi-normal relationship with my parents. When I moved out, the transition was smooth and I never went back or asked for money.

We enjoyed semi-regular contact because we live in the same city and what have you. I thought we got along.

Then suddenly about 26ish days ago, they stopped answering my calls. I tried email, phones, mobiles, facebook, everything. They flat out ignore me, but I see my mother's constant activity and interactions with my sister and other extended members of my family.

I've tried asking uncles and aunts, and they just shrug and say 'ask them'. I called my sister, who asked my parents, and according to her they said that they're 'just busy'.

My sister found it weird that I didn't turn up to my aunt's large birthday party, and asked me why I wasn't there. It's because I wasn't invited and had no idea a party would be going on.

I went to their house, and while their car was in the driveway, their doors were locked and I couldn't see through the windows.

I'm honestly just thinking of giving up, but I keep wondering why they're doing this. There was no fight or reason that I could think of. I don't want to ask my sister to contact them for me again because I don't want her stressing out over this.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Parents (and possibly some members of my extended family) are ghosting me and excluding me from events. Is this normal? How do I deal with this?

My grandma said that they didn't even mention me, and another aunt says they haven't said anything about being mad at me at all. In fact, they were bragging about me a few weeks ago. So that's weird.]"

This is long but I'm at a complete loss and any advice would be incredibly helpful. But I do have to give a little background in order to express my situation appropriately:

When I was 7, my biological father (Jon) gave up his role as a father and passed them to my now step father (Carl) who instantly called me his daughter and took responsibility immediately, and he's been my dad ever since. He's a businessman and CEO of a company, and his family that I was adopted into has tremendous wealth, as well as tremendous dysfunction. My mother emotionally and verbally abused me from a kid until I was 22 (where I finally left and estranged myself from her by choice, for my mental health's sake), and Carl would avoid and ignore the abuse when it happened, even when I begged for help. Because of the chronic stress and anxiety I had throughout my childhood, I developed an autoimmune disease (I later found it was due to my completely depleted adrenal glands) and became very, very sick. It's taken four years of dedication and insanely hard work to get back to the healthy state I'm at now.

He's an on and off again addict to pills and alcohol, and used to be addicted to opiates but who knows at this stage if it's current. He got out of rehab last year and seemed to be so much better, happier, and I saw a genuine change in him when my fiancé and I visited him. We even sat down and he apologized for everything he had contributed to when I was a kid that he hadn't realized he'd done, and would do everything he could to make it up to me. It seemed to be going well this past year. 

I'm a circus artist training at a university that offers a bachelor's degree in circus arts. It's an absolute honor and dream of many (including me) to graduate and succeed through this school, and in our final year of training we get to showcase the act that we've been working on for the last three years to show to the public for the first time, and is a very well known event. It's a very, very big deal to me, and something I had been telling Carl about since 2015, and he's been saying how excited he was to be traveling here to see me perform. It's also a great chance to be able to support me. 

Last night, hours before his flight, he texts me last minute profusely apologizing about how he suddenly can't make it. He gave a list of excuses, one of them being that he has another tumor in his ear (something he had admitted to me last year was a lie, and had apologized for and blamed it on his lack of sobriety), another being ""work emergencies,"" and then an excuse about how the lease to his new apartment hasn't been signed/his agent is being difficult and he can't leave the country without doing it first (he's also moving in way too quickly with his new girlfriend). 

I reminded him that he had admitted to my fiancé and I that his ear tumors were not real, and said that unless I'm sitting in the doctor's office with him and hear it from his own mouth, to not insult my intelligence by bringing that up to me again. That's when he started deflecting, and suddenly saying that after thinking about what I had said, he's realizing that he just isn't cut out to be a father and needs to stop pretending to be someone he's not. He said it would be best if we stopped talking and that I only contact him if I need money, and that he only knows how to show he cares by financially supporting me. He also told me to not come visit him while I'm home next week (I have a flight booked for back home when my school holiday begins).

I reminded him that this is the worst possible thing someone could ever say to me, given that I've already been abandoned by Jon, yet Jon had chosen to continue being a father to my half sister Vicky. I told Carl that if he truly is about to do the same thing to me as Jon did, he better be sending these texts to my two other step/half sisters, otherwise he is doing the same EXACT thing that my dad did to me, and he is singling me out as I've always been throughout my life. His response to that was to twist my words around and say ""I refuse to read the rest of your texts after reading what you just wrote about how sad you were that Jess has to have me as a father. Please spare us both the pain and stop texting."" I told him to stop manipulating the situation in order to deflect and distract me from remembering that he completely fucked me over and broke my trust beyond repair. He keeps pretending that he hasn't read my texts and only says to contact him if I need money. I tried calling so many times because I refuse to deal with serious issues via text, but he blocked me each time. I'm at a complete loss.

I called my sister Jess, and she was shocked because apparently Carl had told her weeks ago that he was going to fly to Oregon to visit her on the same weekend he was supposed to be seeing my show. Jess also had no idea about the ear tumors. He was never planning on coming to Australia and he never had ear tumors, and I'm realizing now that he deliberately created that lie in order to manipulate me into feeling sorry for him, as I'm the ""empathetic"" sister and he knew it wouldn't work with Jess. 

When I was a kid, he convinced me that he was secretly in the CIA and I wasn't to tell a soul even through text, otherwise he could be sent to jail and they'll track him down. He went even further to try and convince me that a telescope he had bought was secretly a nuclear weapon that agents had sent to him to keep until further notice. It's been four years and it's still just sitting in his spare bedroom. He has a history of bipolar disorder so I'm assume that it's related to his illness. The terrifying part is that he is so incredibly convincing and such a good liar, I don't know what's true and what's not. I feel like an idiot for even buying into any of those stories when I was younger, but now I am just concerned. I can't tell if this ""ear tumor"" bullshit is part of his bipolarity, or if he's just a straight up fucking liar. 

I'm absolutely disgusted and heartbroken as he is the only family I have left. My mother's side of the family is just as abusive, so I refuse to let them back into my life. His family doesn't really speak to me unless I'm at a family gathering and I don't feel close enough to reach out to them about this, although I'm tempted to do it anyway since this is just absolutely insane. The only person I'm now in touch with is Carl's daughter/my step sister, who has also kept Carl at a distance because of how much he has hurt her too. 

I'm supposed to fly home next Sunday, but he told me not to go visit him. I just can't stop crying and am at a complete loss on how to handle this. I know I have to keep my distance, but I also am in a situation where I'm financially reliant on him due to being a full time student in a foreign country, and because of my health condition I haven't been able to work while juggling a full time training regimen at school. I HATE that I am financially dependent on him right now, and I vowed a long time ago to not have to be in this position once I'm hired into a company and find my feet after graduating, but that's the reality I'm in right now. It hurts so much to know that the only way he will respond is if I ask for money. I just want a dad. 


What do I even do right now? He's always had bipolar disorder, but no one ever knows to what extent since he is so good at masking it and being such a good liar, and saying how he's on medicine that keeps him in complete control. He has a history of manipulating and lying to everyone in his life, and I thought that would have gone away when he got sober, or at least he wouldn't dare do that to me after knowing what I've been through. I was very mistaken. You can't help someone who won't accept help, and I'm realizing that no matter what happens, I need to keep him at a distance from now on because I will never trust him again. But I just don't know how to handle this current situation at all... especially when my own father is acting like a child and refuses to even take my call or read a text. If anyone has any advice on how to move forward, it would be incredibly appreciated. I'm so sorry for rambling, but I'm at a loss and don't even know how to stoop to this level of dysfunction. And of course it's Father's Day today.

Edit 1: I saw a counselor. She encouraged me to try and book a flight for my fiancé to come home with me so I'm not alone. My fiancé wants to rip him a new asshole.

Edit 2: My grandmother just died. He told me via text, and continued to ignore my texts and calls. He also somehow canceled the card information I had and refuses to pay for my fiancé to come home with me. He wants to cut off any support when I come home and isolate me, and I see right through it. It's incredible to me how people reveal themselves while attempting to hide.

Edit 3: I tried to reach out to my uncle/his brother by sending a message saying I didn't know who else I felt I could turn to and was in tremendous pain. He ignored my message and immediately sent it to my step dad, who just said ""Keep complaining to my family about me and I will cut you off. Immediately. Stop this now."" I'm in a state of shock. Typical addict behavior of threatening me unless I obey. He has stooped to a new level of fucked up. 



tl;dr - My step father just told me he doesn't want to be a father to me anymore, and told me to only contact him for financial reasons.

"I blew my friend's [26,M] cover that he cheated on his bachelor party. His wedding got called off. How to repair situation and move on?


I put together a bachelor party for my best friend and our buddies. We have been friends since kindergarten. During the trip, the fiancé’s brother took the bachelor to a massage parlor, where they were jerked off by prostitutes. The bachelor ended up going back to the same parlor the following night.

After the party, the bachelor told his fiancé that he had gotten a lap dance at a strip club, and she freaked out. He obviously omitted all the details about the massage parlor. Fiancé called my girlfriend and my girlfriend convinced the fiancé that a lap dance was a terrible reason to call of a marriage, and that the bachelor is a trustworthy person.

Later, my girlfriend asked me if any cheating had actually gone on at the party. I covered up for the bachelor and denied that cheating happened. 

For the next few days, my girlfriend suspected that I wasn’t being truthful. I am not a good liar. She kept asking me over and over if cheating had happened, which I kept denying. She became more and more suspicious of me. After about a week, I finally broke, and told her what had happened. She insisted that the bride-to-be deserved to know. I ended up calling my friend and telling him that I had spilled the beans, and I told him that he should come clean to his fiancé before she hears from another source. He proceeded to tell her the truth, and their marriage is now off. 

I feel guilt for not stopping my friend when I saw him making the mistake of going up to the massage parlor. Currently, he’s not in a good place in life, and our friendship is ruined. While he blames himself for cheating, he admits that he would have kept it to himself and lived with his guilt. I basically spilled the beans and forced him to come clean. He puts blame on me for ruining his marriage. 

I know in my gut that I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I was put in a terrible position by my friend. However, I still feel guilty for not stopping him from cheating, and sometimes I feel as if I am personally responsible for his wedding getting called off. Did I make a mistake by telling the truth? Do you have any advice on how to handle our friendship moving forwards? Thank you reddit!

  **tl;dr**: I blew my friend's cover that he cheated on his bachelor party. His wedding got called off, and he puts a great deal of blame on me. How can I repair our friendship (Or should I even bother), and how to move on from this terrible situation?

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I know I was in the wrong for lying to my girlfriend. I don't believe I was wrong in exposing my friend's cheating. I also wanted to state that this happened a couple months ago. While it rocked my relationship with my gf, she understands the reason I held the truth from her was because dropping a bomb on my friend's life was a very difficult thing to do. For that reason she forgives me for lying and has trust in me. I have learned a valuable lesson that I will be 100% honest moving forwards."

"I [23M] unsure about the future with my fiance [23F] of 3 years [UPDATE]


[Original Post](https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6e26wc/i_23m_unsure_about_the_future_with_my_fiance_23f/)


I figured I'd do a bit of an update on my situation to vent a bit and hopefully help someone in a similar position where I was.
Thanks to everyone who posted in my original thread, got some solid advices there and the courage to do what's best for myself.

After posting I decided it was time to have another talk. I was mentally prepared for a breakup at that point. We talked about everything and told each other how we felt and what isn't right. We both decided to give it a shot, but I told her that I am not 100% and she told me to tell her once I have made up my mind.

The next few days I was fairly distant from her and she noticed that, asking me whether I had already made up my decision to break up. I still hadn't, but I was thinking about it all the time.

A few weeks later I felt like I had enough. Even though we both changed for the better, I just didn't feel the connection between us anymore. I wanted to be selfish at that time and did what was right in my opinion so I told her I want to split up.
I basically summarized it to her that it is not fair to keep her in relationship where I am so unsure about all my feelings and not being able to see us holding together for another 5 years. 

There were hurt feelings, ofcouse. She wasn't 100% agreeing on this decision either. But it had to be done. And now I feel a lot better about it - I have just moved to my own apartment and it's all going good. It's as if I can finally breathe on my own and do what I want when I want.

I have also taken advice about counceling and will be going to therapy to see why I may have changed so much during this relationship and whether my issues are related to anxiety or something totally else.

My advice is don't be in a relationship just for the status guys, you will just be prolonging the inevitable and make everyone feel way worse compared to the fact that you would've just ended it earlier. Or even worse, breaking up due to cheating. Be selfish, it's okay in situations like this.

  **tl;dr**: After original post had a discussion with my ex about us and our problems, decided to try anyways, ended the relationship a few weeks after that.

"Me [39 M] with my wife [35 F] of 17, don't agree on importance of alone time since birth of child


I know I’m biased and anyone reading this should know that too.  That said, I just want the input of a bunch of strangers to help me get a handle on this issue.  As I try to type this story I realize every detail warrants a caveat but I don’t know how to tell a story like that so if there’s any interest I’ll provide details upon request.

My wife of 17 years and I haven’t had any alone time/a date night since our child was born 2 years ago.  (I’m 39 and she’s 35).  For Christmas 2015 she actually bought me a movie theater gift certificate and a movie  themed  treat with a note saying we would go see a movie together.  When that didn’t happen by the end of January 2016 and I was showing signs of frustration she sent me to the movies to on my own.

Finally, earlier this year, we planned a movie night.  Her mom was on hand to watch our child and I thought she got off work at 5 PM but her schedule varies so I wasn’t sure.  To be fair, we didn’t plan ahead in great detail, we just agreed we’d go to dinner and see a movie.  Her mom showed up on time but the missus didn’t come home until after 6.  We both wanted to see the same movie and I’d found a perfect time at a favorite theater that also serves food but by the time she came home and spent a leisurely 30-60 minutes visiting with mom and toddler, we could only catch a late show after a fast food dinner.

I clarified that she did, in fact, get off work at 5 but spent another hour  talking to a co-worker (because they had to touch base – they don’t get to talk often)  and then doing a non-essential personal task that could have been done the night before or after.  To make matter worse, she got home from work so quickly the night before that I was really surprised to see her.  That night, when I asked her how she got home so fast,  she said, “Because I wanted to.”

So I was pissed.  And I’m not proud of the fact but I was angry and even swore at her.  She bluntly told me I could be angry and spoil our night or I could run with it and we could carry on.  The whole evening felt super perfunctory – just like she was taking me out to prevent a temper tantrum.  She even said as much.  And it’s true I have a history of complaining vociferously when plans change. I mean I’m not a wife beater or anything but I guess I can be childish if “I don’t get my way.”

I hate myself for this but I can’t let it go.  I'm trying to understand her commitments to work and our child and I really want to be supportive but it just pissed me off that on the one night in years we set aside for ourselves – I guess just for me – she couldn’t be bothered.  At least, that’s how I took it.

What can I do to make a future date nights positive instead of just being angry about the last one?  I feel like it’s reasonable to want time out alone together even though we have a small child but I have plenty of family and friends who don’t feel that way.  Am I being selfish?  I have a long history of holding on to petty details so, in general, any advice on not being an asshole would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I feel like my wife blew off a rare “date night” and I’m Having trouble letting go of my upset (if it’s even valid).  Part of me wants to play the “so who’s right?” card here but I mainly just want advice on how to move on and improve future circumstances.  

e: fixed typos, poor formatting, etc for clarity. 

EDIT2:  I never expected a response like this and I really want to thank you all for your thoughtful advice. It's been pretty overwhelming, and sometimes uncomfortable to read and think about but it's feels good and really helpful to see it discussed out of my head and get input from outside.  "

"My [26 M] family disowned me, now want to reconnect.


Intentionally vague for the sake of anonymity and because I don't like talking about it. 

I grew up the youngest child of a very conservative religious household. When I was in my mid teens my brothers told my parents they thought I might be gay and they sent me to church based ""counseling"", which devolved into physical and sexual abuse. I got hurt, authorities got involved, and I was put in foster care. My family didn't try to get me back and have said a lot of hurtful things to/about me since everything happened. 

I recently got a message from one of my sisters on Facebook saying that she and my mother are sorry for what happened and would like to reconnect. I am not sure how to respond. On one hand, I really love/loved my family and I missed my mom terribly for a long time. I would like to meet my sister's children and be a part of the family again. On the other hand, I still feel hurt and betrayed that they let those things happen to me and I feel like they threw me away. I know that the relationships we had that I miss are gone permanently. I'm also very close with my new mom and I don't want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like she was just a placeholder until my ""real"" family came back. I don't know what to do or say to anyone.

Thanks for reading, and sorry if anything's unclear.

"My [28/F] now ex-bf [30/M] lied about his whole life: Purple Heart, family, cancer...


I've recently had issues with my boyfriend of 3 years... well ex now. He's the only man my daughter has told that she loves him (other than paw-paw). He talked about our future as a family, and how we are raising her, said he'd kill or die for her, claimed her as his own... She's only 7, I'm hiding what I can from her. 

It all started when I found out he was cheating on me with a 19 year old girl. She didn't know about me or my daughter. She knows now, and has ghosted him. She's helped me out a lot in the situation, gave me texts, photos, snapchats. I'm grateful for her kindness and maturity. But as of now, cheating is the least of my worries.

He's lied about his military career. Told everyone about his 3 deployments and how he was injured, he said it was an IED explosion and he was shot twice in the altercation, spending time in overseas hospitals. It was a lie. He's never been deployed. Not once. I helped him through his fake PTSD attacks, his crying when he was drunk, pitiful about how he killed women and children. It's sickening. Even used my daughter as an example 'You know one of the kids I killed was no older than (my daughter's name)?""
He lied about his little brother who died when they both got deployed together. He blamed himself because he wasn't there for his little brother when he died. His brother never existed. I pet him, reassured him threw every fit he had... Had me reduced to tears along with my sympathy.

He had a previous marriage and daughter that he lied about. He said she packed up and left him on his 2nd deployment, said she was cheating on him and took her pregnant belly with her. Said she filed for abandonment and he never saw them again. But I found another local woman that didn't have the same name as his ex-wife, with the exact same pictures of this child. He lied about it all.

He lied about his ex-gf's boyfriend stabbing him 5 times. No police report, no hospital trip, all self-inflicted. Told conflicting stories to different people. He made her out to be a monster, he cried to my daddy that she abused him. She's actually a nice girl, I've apologized to her recently, she's moved on and is very happy in a healthy relationship.

He lied about having prostate cancer. Could not tell me the stage, proper treatment, facility, medications, no unexplained absences (it apparently ""happened"" while we were together) 

He got drunk and pulled me off the bed one night, fracturing my toes and foot. He then took the magazine out of his firearm, put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, it didn't go off, there was a bullet in the chamber. My daughter was in the next room. I was scared and called his doctor and left a message. She thought it was his sister and contacted her instead of me. He found out, told his sister that I'm crazy, then yelled at me and said that if I told his doctor anything, he'd end up in a padded cell... I should've pursued that more.

Wednesday night he knew I knew everything and was planning on discreetly leaving (I had been preparing for a month). I called my parents (both police officers) for help, they were an hour away. I will never forget his face, how he smiled the whole time as he said ""Well I got one on you, (daughters name), and your parents for a good 3 years huh?"" I started recording with my phone before that because I wanted proof if he hurt me. I was alone with him, and scared. He noticed and came after me, grabbed me to get to my phone, and I tried to run out of our back door, he took my phone and slammed it down the 2nd floor balcony, and just smiled at me as I screamed and cried 'why'...

The police came, all military veterans and I explained everything that happened. They asked him about his time in the military and his deployments. Hearing him say 'no deployments' killed me. Sitting there realizing everything was a lie. Helping him with his PTSD was a lie, all the fake nightmares and crying from him. He was a hero to me... I felt sick. They told him to grab some clothes and leave. He did. My parents came and packed what I could and am safe. They were heartbroken, they loved him as family, had the same sympathy as I did... knew that their grandchild was going to suffer for it.

My phone was trashed, but still rang, I couldn't answer it. Took it to the Apple store and it backed up automatically to my iCloud, but was ultimately shattered and battery was swollen. $700 destroyed. (possible update with that if I can press charges bc I'll have proof he threw it and have proof of admitting to every horrible thing he's lied about. Also grabbing the police report from when the cops came.)

How do I handle everything that's happened? How do I not cry in front of my daughter... How do I tell her anything about why he's gone? She loves him... I will never forgive that. How do I trust another man ever again? Do I just block it out and move on? He's truly a sick person, and I know every truth about him, what are the chances of him trying to hurt me, my daughter, or even himself? Why do I still miss him? Why am I mad at myself instead of taking it as his fault? I feel so helpless, sick, gullible, and used. I paid off his credit card, bought him a gaming laptop (to be fair, he paid a lot of the laptop money back, only short $500 out of that), gave money for his dentures, paid for his 'ptsd' medicine when he didn't have insurance... 
But a silver lining, all the talk of us getting married, future children, just future in general... won't ever happen with us. I have a bright future in law enforcement about to start in a couple of weeks.

"Me [36 F] Found out I need a hysterectomy, also found out I may also have ovarian cancer. I just started a new job and I feel like an asshole. Where do I go from here? I am so lost.


I apologize in advance as some details here are going to be gross and may not be suitable for all readers.  


I have struggled with pelvic pain most of my adult life and over the last year it has become increasingly worse.    
I have had multiple surgeries trying to correct the issues that I have but in the end nothing has really helped, in fact it just created more scar tissue. In April I was working a job that I did not find fulfilling, so when I was offered a better position with better pay I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately the month that I started the new job ended up being one of the worst pain months I have ever had. It's hard for me to focus and concentrate, which is not good because I am in a very technical position and it is self taught.   I went to my OB to discuss pain management options, I had an ultrasound that revealed multiple lesions on my uterus, multiple cysts on my ovaries and a complex cyst on my right one that has the possibility of being cancer.  
Now I have a Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy scheduled for the end of July and I have to take at least a month of leave from my new job to get this taken care of.


Here's the problem, frankly I feel like a giant asshole loser who is letting everyone down. We are short-handed at my new job already and one of the main people today just gave 2 weeks notice. My manager/company owner is being completely awesome about the situation which makes me feel even worse. I really care about these people and I feel like I am letting them down. I feel like I am letting my husband down. We have been married for 11 years and tried for a while to have children and that did not work out well and now, any possibility of having biological children is completely gone. Also he now has to take at least 2 weeks off of work to take care of me post-op and that just completely adds to me feeling like a complete loser. Can't have kids, can't work my job, can't even take care of myself! 


I can not express the absolute feelings of self loathing and self hatred I have right now. I am so scared of this surgery, I am so scared I have cancer... I am so scared that everyone is going to be mad at me. I feel like I should be able to control this situation and I can't. I just keep crying and beating up on myself over this and it sucks!  


I don't know where to go from here. I have a therapist, but I rarely see her and don't really have great history with therapy so I don't think talking to her about this is going to help much. I guess what I am asking here is: have you gone through a similar situation?  
And if so, how did you handle it? What kinds of things did you do to get in a good mental state? I just hate myself so much over all of this. I have no idea how to move forward here.  
Any advice would be appreciated.

"Me [35M] with my wife [36F] of two years, I'm in a wheelchair and I can't tell if I'm the butt of a weird joke with her friends (30-35, M/F)


Using a throwaway here. I met my now wife when I was 30 years. I was working as an EMT and she was a law student. We lived in the same apartment complex and got along really well. About a year into our relationship I was involved in a car accident that left me paralyzed (almost full use of my hands and arms, no use of my legs). Since we had only been dating a year, I assumed she would move on to someone else, but to my delight she stayed with me and we got married two years ago. 



My wife was my first real girlfriend. I had been with two other women during college, but that was it. She had a much more typical dating history and had been with multiple men throughout her twenties. Her last long term relationship ended when he didn't want her starting law school when she was 31 years old. 


I felt very insecure about our relationship which got a lot worse after my accident. I became worried she would leave me for a healthy lawyer. We went through counseling and now things are really good between us. She has never done anything to make me think she'd cheat on me. Plus I feel a lot better now that I got a large settlement from my accident and can contribute equally to our life together.


My wheelchair has of course limited our life somewhat, but not as much as you'd think. We go on vacations, out to dinner and the movies, she hikes while I take nature photographs, etc. She seems very happy with our relationship and we are in the process of adopting a baby.



The other night when we were having dinner she got a text message that made her laugh. I asked her what was funny and she turned her phone away from me and said it was nothing. I'm not proud but my insecurities got the better of me and I later snooped through her phone.



I found an odd group text conversation between her and a few of her friends from law school. One of them had sent her a picture of a man who vaguely resembles me standing in line. The message said ""I saw [my name] at Sears"", to which she responded ""lol"".  The man did not look that much like me, but did have my same basic characteristics (I am pretty regular looking, I am thin, have a beard, short hair, and glasses). The friend obviously did not actually think this man was me because he wasn't in a wheelchair.



I scrolled back through the thread and found her friends have sent her over two dozen candid shots of men who look similar to me engaged in various everyday activities. All of the photographs included weird exchanges between my wife and her friends. One of the pictures showed ""me"" smoking a cigarette outside a store. My wife and her friend texted for a few minutes about how well I've hidden my smoking from her (I've never smoked). 



The weirdest one was of a man who kind of looked like me with his arm around a woman. Her friend had written to her, ""I'm so sorry, looks like [my name] is stepping out on you"". My wife responded that she is devastated and can't believe I would betray her. They all texted back and forth a few times about my infidelity and ended the conversation with ""lol"". It looks like my wife took a few of the pictures herself and sent them to her friends.




I immediately asked my wife what these pictures were. She said it is just a weird inside joke and doesn't know how it started and that it means nothing. I do feel they are making fun of me, but I don't actually understand what the joke is. This is bringing back a lot of my insecurities and can't tell if I'm justifiably upset by this or if I'm overreacting.


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My wife and her friends take pictures of men who look like me as part of some weird joke I don't understand.


   **edit**: I was told to edit my post with this comment: I agree it doesn't seem to be mocking me personally. I am a bit sensitive about one of her friends on the thread because he previously made some rude comments about me not being able to do basic, every day activities because of my wheelchair. So when I saw he was taking pictures of men who look like me doing normal stuff, I remembered the rude comments he made to me.

"Me [24 M] with my co-workers. How to politely make them back off about how I dress?


I work in an office environment with a very casual dress code. As long as we're not meeting a client, jeans, t-shirts, and the like are all relatively okay to wear on the average day.

However, I myself have a skin condition that covers quite a bit of my body. I treat it as best I can, and I'm sure no one notices it as much as I do. But for that reason, I have a tough time showing off my forearms and legs. 

While I don't wear sweaters or anything like that in the summer, I still tend to prefer long-sleeve t-shirts and linen pants to, for example, a polo and a pair of shorts. 

I started working in the autumn, so this wasn't a problem. But now that the weather's getting warmer, the entire office seems to have singled me out. It's actually sort of becoming a running joke, and my boss is actually one of the worst offenders. 

""Aren't you hot? How can you be wearing that in this heat? Oh look, he's wearing long sleeves again!"" And then everyone laughs.

I've told them that with the air conditioning, I get cold, so I just dress to combat it. Or that I like being on the warmer side. I've even given them the most uncomfortable face I could muster to try to signal them to back off. But it still keeps up, and it's kind of getting old.

Now, I know they mean no harm, but it's tangentially centered around an insecurity I've coped with my entire life. It can ruin my morning, and I'm about ready to just roll up a sleeve and let everyone see what I'm hiding. 

Before it comes to that, is there a way to politely ask them to stop?
