"My poor boss


A quick one
$me = me  
$boss = boss  

Last night (Sunday) my boss calls me up at around 2330 (11:30pm).  

&gt;$boss: ""Hey $me, can you help me out real fast? I'm trying to do payroll and my computer shut off.""  
*At this point I've already gone through half a bottle of vodka, so I'm feeling it.*  
&gt;$me: ""Can you walk me through the steps exactly to get to this point?""  
*$boss proceeds to walk me through his process, nothing seems off.*  
&gt;$me: ""Hmmm, that seems to be alright. Were there any errors popping up?""  
&gt;$boss: ""Nothing, that's what's weird.""  
*I pour myself another drink and take a minute. In the quiet I hear a computer running in the background.*  
&gt;$me: ""Hey, $boss, is that your computer running.""  
&gt;$boss: ""No, the screen is black.""  
*Recalling a previous tale I heard on TFTS*  
&gt;$me: ""Do me a favor, can you look under your desk and tell me if all the cords are plugged in?""  
&gt;$boss: ""I'm an idiot, I unplugged the screen from the tower with my foot...""  
&gt;$me: ""No worries, *drunk me decides to make a joke* Is it running now?""  
&gt;$boss: ""Yes, thank you!""  
&gt;$me: ""Then you better go catch it!"" *Proceed to $boss and I laughing way too hard over a terrible joke, thank you alcohol.*  

TL;DR: 6'9"" boss needs more workspace."
"""But I didn't spill the coffee!""


Long time listener, first time caller.

I have been in this IT Support business for about 20 years. Through this time, I've been privileged to support some very intelligent people and a gaggle of idiots.

I'll tell this tale and you can decide where this user fits in.


I got a broken laptop into my office, which is no new thing. It won't power on.

$User: My laptop suddenly stopped working!

$Me: What were you doing when the laptop died?

$User: I was working on some research.

$Me: Was there a power surge? Did you spill anything in your laptop?

$User: No, I didn't do anything.


So I got out my trusty screwdriver set and opened this bad boy. Coffee poured out.


$Me: Uh, you said you didn't spill anything on your laptop.

$User: **indignantly** Well, *I* didn't spill *anything*!

$Me: ...but there is coffee pouring out of this laptop.

$User: Oh, my wife spilled that. Does it make any difference? I didn't spill the coffee, so the laptop should still work.

$Me: Yes. Anything spilled in your laptop can make it stop working, no matter who did it.

$User: Oh. Even if I didn't spill it?

$Me: Uhhhhhhh.

Still, I recovered his data and sent his laptop to the big IEEE electronics recycler in the sky."
