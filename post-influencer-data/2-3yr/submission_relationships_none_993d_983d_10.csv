"Update: My (24F) partner (23M) is getting popular on Twitch and it's killing something we used to love doing together [relationships]


[removed]"
"I (21F) set up a date between my two friends (29M/25F). Something went wrong that night and now my guy friend won't talk to me.


I met my friend Chuck (29M) about 1.5 years ago. We were both part of an online local group for single parents, and eventually met offline with other group parents. I have known Britt (25F) since high school. 

Chuck's wife died of childbirth complications the day their daughter was born, more than two years ago. Britt is a few months out of a 9-year relationship. Both of them have expressed wanting to meet other people, and I thought they'd be good for each other because of common interests and we all have kids of similar ages. 

Two days before Christmas, Chuck and Britt went out on their first date. I kept Chuck's daughter at my house so the two could have some more time together without him having to worry about the baby.

The plan was for her to spend the night (she's done it before and gets along great with my 3 year old girl), but Chuck knocked on my door at 11pm to get his daughter. He barely said a word to me and I could tell he had been crying, but he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. 

The next day, I asked Britt what happened. She said that they had dinner and a couple drinks, things were going excellent. She said she felt like they had great chemistry and were even getting physical at his house, but he suddenly told her to stop and to leave immediately. She swears that she has no idea what she did wrong and is really hurt by the whole thing. I believe her because she is really sweet and social, I've never seen her do anything to piss anyone off. 

I tried to talk to Chuck at the same time to get his side of the story and see what went wrong. All he said that he ""wasn't feeling it"" and didn't want to discuss it further. I didn't push it, but when I went to wish him a merry Christmas a day later, I saw he had deleted me from his social media. I texted it to him instead and asked ""you okay?"" but no response. 

I am seriously hurt and don't know what to do. Chuck has become one of my closest friends, and our daughters are the best of friends too. I am really worried that this has something to do with his wife, and I want to apologize if he felt like I was pressuring him to date after her death. At the same time, I don't want to overstep boundaries and bother him when he's having a hard time. It's been over a week and I'm worried/upset. 

**tldr: I set my two friends up on a date. Things were apparently going well until my guy friend suddenly called off the date. He has now deleted me from his social media and will not talk to me.**

**EDIT: Someone mentioned that Chuck may be in love with me, but deleted the comment. I still want to address that. He's almost a full decade older than me, and has never expressed those feelings for me at all. In fact, the week before he cut me off, he said that I was a great friend and he was happy that his daughter had some female figures in her life.**

**EDIT 2: Thanks for all of your advice, everyone. I think I will give it another week before I speak with him again. If he hasn't reached out by then, I will tell him that I am still here if he needs to talk but I will continue to give him space if he needs that, too. I am almost 100% sure that this happened because of his wife's death. Another one of my friends who is still on his Facebook saw that he had changed his cover photo several times since Christmas, and all of them were from his wedding.**

"[UPDATE] My bf [27m] makes me [21f] feel scared without any reason at all and I don't know if I should bring it up, break up with him or just see a therapist.


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jgfkj/my_bf_27m_makes_me_21f_feel_scared_without_any/

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who tried to help me, truly. I appreciate it a lot &lt;3

I got it checked out and found out I have severe anxiety. So yeah. It wasn't my bf's fault at all - he's lovely- it's just me. And I ended up telling him that. He was very supportive and laughed a little bit when I told him I was scared of him. He said ""yeah, I'm definitely not a serial killer"". It's all good.

tl;dr: i have anxiety"

I took the advice of a lot of people on here and asked her why she's so upset.  She went off on how I'm an ""insensitive prick"" and ""not holding up my end of the lease"".I asked her what she meant. She thought that the whole renting a room thing was also going to be a friends with benefits thing. WTF!?

That was never mentioned or even implied when I agreed to let her rent.My girlfriend helped her get her room set up, she knows that I'm proposing to my girlfriend soon. Why would I need someone else to sleep with? I never flirted or anything.

She(crazy) started yelling about how she's made it obvious this whole time. Why else would she walk around in a towel? Um, because you live here? I walk around in my boxers all the time. It's normal..

After that she told me to go fuck my self and that she's moving out on Wednesday.

Edit: Proposing to my girlfriend in 5 minutes. Wish me luck. 

Edit2: She said yes!

"I[19F] was the only person in my family to get my dad [50M] a Christmas present


This is my throwaway account because my brother reddits and I don't want him to see this.


Hi, /r/relationships, I need some advice.
I have the best dad in the world. My dad has done nothing but support me and be there for me. He works full time as one of the top electrical engineers in his company, does the majority of the housework, and financially supports my mom, my brother, and me. (My mom also works but doesn't make much.) My dad pays fully for both my brother's and my college tuition, room, board, textbooks, cars, insurance...everything. He is always there to help and has been my go-to person since I was little. 


Here's the thing. My dad is very quiet, reserved, and introverted. He doesn't talk very much and doesn't really enjoy meeting new people or venturing out on new adventures.  He honestly just likes to stay at home or sometimes go to the gym. Because of this, he really doesn't have many ""friends""... mostly just work colleagues or a gym acquaintance. He really only has his family. But that's the problem.


My family is...a little off its rocker. My mother was emotionally abusive for the majority of my time at home (but has since gotten much better) and my brother is very haughty and arrogant. My extended family has a plethora of health problems that limit them from seeing us very much, and they also live far away. This makes Christmas and other holidays just for me, my brother, and my parents. 


My mom hates Christmas (we're still not quite sure why) and my brother seems to think he is too good to spend his money on Christmas presents. While this may seem like a very trivial problem to some, it ended up that I was the only person in my entire family that got my dad a Christmas present. 


While my dad is very good at hiding emotions, I could tell he was upset. It broke my heart to see my dad upset. My dad deserves so much more than this and I can't believe no one else can see how much he does for our family enough to even get him a Christmas present.


I guess my question is this: even though I got my dad something, I want to do more to show him how much I appreciate him. What can I do to show him how much I love him? Christmas presents just don't seem like enough.


TL;DR I was the only one in my entire family to get my dad a Christmas present. My dad was upset and now I'm upset and want to show him how much he means to me. What do?"

"[UPDATE] How should I [22F] handle the escalating issues with my neighbors [30-40?s]?


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jv0gm/how_should_i_22f_handle_the_escalating_issues/

This did not turn out the way I expected at all, but boy do I feel good.

Now that I know everyone's names, it'll be easier to keep straight:

Ashley and Ben = the couple living in the other half of the duplex

Robert and Liz = the couple living in the house next door (closer to our half of the duplex)

Dan = our landlord

When I made the OP, I mentioned that my roommate sent an e-mail to our landlord to let him know that we were thinking of moving out. He gave her a call on the phone a few days later and said that he had heard some outlandish stories about us from Robert and Liz and that he wanted to figure out what was going on. He asked her a few questions then said that he thought we were good tenants and wanted to get to the bottom of this.

Today, he arranged for me and my roommate, Ashley and Ben, and Robert and Liz to meet up to discuss the situation. Robert and Liz did not show up, so Dan asked us to each share our concerns. Ashley started by saying that she was frustrated because we keep banging on the walls even though she has asked us to stop, and that Robert told her that we told him that we sent someone over to vandalize their Christmas decorations (which resulted in Ashley calling the cops). She said that she and her children had been terrified and had trouble sleeping at night because of the harassment.

I told her that I was incredibly sorry that she went through something so scary, but that we had absolutely nothing to do with it and I had never spoken to Robert (whose name I just learned) aside from introducing myself when he and his wife moved in. She then went on to say that Robert and Liz claimed that I had told them that I was sleeping with Ben, her husband. Reddit, I was LIVID. Ashley didn't believe that I was sleeping with her husband of course, but she was furious that I was telling the neighbors that I was. Understandable, but again I had never spoken to Robert and I just learned her husband's name thirty minutes ago.

At this point we realized that a lot of our anger stemmed from lies that Robert had told. We had never had problems with each other until Robert and Liz moved in next door. We started exchanging stories with each other. Robert would tell my roommate one thing and tell Ashley and Ben almost the complete opposite. Ashley noted that the noise she heard was always coming from the outside of the house (not our shared wall) and she believed that it was us tapping the window only because Liz said she had seen us out there; however, just last night Ashley's youngest child said that someone (who they thought was Robert) was tapping on the window while we weren't home, so she knew something was up. We also thought it was extremely telling that they didn't show up for the tenant meeting.

Another interesting point - Ben brought up that Liz and Robert would fight outside in the middle of the night so loud that they could hear it from their side of the house. My roommate and I previously thought that it was Ashley and Ben, but now that I think about it, the midnight fights didn't start until this month.

Reddit, I never believed that I would witness this level of shit-stirring. Ashley and Ben said that at one point, Liz said that she really wanted her sister to move into the neighborhood so they could be close. So the only possible motivation I could see is that maybe Robert and Liz wanted to turn us against each other until one of us moved out. If that was their plan, it almost worked! It just seems so crazy to me though.

Ben and Ashley recently set up a camera outside of their house (originally meant to catch us in the act) that Robert and Liz somehow know about. So either the camera will be enough to stop Robert or they'll catch the real culprit. Dan said that legally, there wasn't much he could do. But we all agreed that we would start calling the cops when the midnight fights start (like a redditor suggested in the last post).

Even though we still have to deal with Robert and Liz, I feel so much better now knowing the truth. Nothing made sense before, and that was the most frustrating part. Tomorrow, my roommate and I are going to bring Ashley and Ben a pie from the bakery that we work at as an olive branch.
  ---   
TLDR: We found out that the source of our problems with our neighbors was a SHIT TON of lies spread by our other neighbors. We think that they might have been trying to create a vacancy in the neighborhood. Whatever they were trying to accomplish won't work anymore since my roommate and our duplex mates have agreed to ignore them. Thanks to anyone who read either of my long posts!"

"Me [32 F] with my Cousin [14 F], she stole a gift and lied about it. I want to demand an apology, and have a talk with her about character.



Today at my family Christmas party, my cousin, Annie, stole one of my gifts and hid it in her suitcase. I received a purse that she really admired, and she was messing around with the straps, trying it on and looking through all the pockets. I didn‚Äôt mind, we often pass around our gifts and tinker.

Annie and her mother, Sally, were leaving to go visiting with other people, I asked Annie where the purse wound up. It was immediately clear the she had stolen it, but I gave her an easy out and she didn‚Äôt take it. She dug in her heals and lied to everyone about it. 

My whole family ‚Äì my Mother, Grandmother, and one other Aunt ‚Äì all made a show of searching for the purse, but no one found it. Annie and Sally had to be somewhere, and so they left and we ransacked the room that they are staying in to find it. 

I had to leave before they returned, but my other Aunt left a note where the purse was found that said ‚ÄúMissing Something?‚Äù They will return later tonight and she will get in trouble. 

I want an apology from her, via FaceTime, and I want to use the conversation to impress upon her the importance of being an honest and trustworthy person. 

This will create conflict that my family often avoids, but I want to attempt to change the expectation that this behavior will be swept under the rug.

 I love my cousin dearly, and I want to bee a good role model to her.  I feel like I would be failing as a family member if I didn‚Äôt use this opportunity to have a conversation about the importance of character, and how to build trust in a relationship. 

I pushed boundaries and made bad decisions as a teenager too, and I can empathize with her immensely. I need some advice on what to say to her. Frankly, I think she needs to apologize to everyone. This just isn‚Äôt how Sally deals with discipline. I will have to demand an apology from Annie in order to make it happen.

I don‚Äôt have a great relationship with Sally, but I used to. She alienated my husband, and he hasn‚Äôt come to a family gathering in 3 years because of how she acted towards him. 

She apologized to my husband by emailing me and asking me to pass it along. I refused to be a middle man, and said that she needed to at *least* email it to him, if not call him. He never responded because he was so mad about what she did, and now Sally and I have a strained relationship. 

Apologies from her a rarely actually an apology, because she says that she‚Äôs sorry for how you feel, and not what she has done. This is a whole other problem, and I hate to think that Annie will be the same way.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of great advice in this sub about talking points, and that is what I‚Äôm after here. I‚Äôm not a parent, and I‚Äôm not around teenagers a whole lot. How do I talk to my teenage cousin about honesty and trustworthiness? What would you say to her if you were me? Is this even appropriate to do, or should I butt out?

**TL;DR:** My teenage cousin stole a gift, and lied to everyone about it. I want to demand an apology and use the conversation to talk about the importance of her character. Is this a good idea? What should I say to her?

  
**update** I called this morning to speak with aunt Sally. She immediately put Annie on the phone and she gave me an apology. 

I told her a story about how I was arrested when I was 16 for shoplifting, and how embarrassed I had been over all of it. I told her that I thought I knew how she was feeling, that I loved her very much, and that I knew she was capable of making better decisions in the future. She cried a bit and told me she loved me. I think it's a pretty good outcome, but only time will tell if the experience had the right impact on her. "

"Me [33 F]had to call social services on my Aunt (53f) for exploitation and neglect of my Grandmother (80)and now everyone in my family is mad at me


So I live 1500 miles away from my family. My Grandmother has had Alzheimer's and dementia for 10 years. My mother (50f) is my Grandmother's care taker, but not her Power of Attorney my Aunt (55f) is. 

My grandmother has gotten to the point that she is being violent, she has threatened to burn the house down and has recently gotten hurt and will not allow anyone to change the bandages eveb though she is a diabetic. My mother wants to put my Grandmother in a home but My Aunt will not allow her to do that, but also will not take care of my Grandmother herself leaving my mother to feel obligated to keep caring for her even though she is a danger to herself and others and my mom knows she cant give the proper care. 

Yesterday I am on video chat with my sister( 28f) and my mother and I heard my Grandmother telling my mother she was going to burn the house down and run away, she also hit my nephew whom is 2 and everyone laughs it off. I have experience with Alzheimer's patients and I know they can spiral out of control, so I keep advising my mom and my Aunt to put her in a home.  My Aunt has not worked for 10 years and lives off my grandmothers money,has recently bought a new car  but my Grandmother is always in jeopardy of not having electricity and no food. My mother and my sister buy food from their food stamps but My Aunt should be the one that buys the food and pay bills not my mother since my mother is care taker. My granmother gets 2000 or in ssi and pension and sees none of it. 

I notice these things yesterday AND that she has a wound as a diabetic that could easily get infected- but she wont let anyone change the bandages- and no one has thought to take her to the hospital to get it cared for. I tell my mom again yesterday that if she doesnt do anything I will. So, today when no one answered my plea and no one wanted to listen and shout over me, I called Social Services to come evaluate things. They agreed and someone will be there to look sometime in the next week. 

Anyway, that up set my Aunt whom is stealing my grandmothers money so she threatened to call the cops on my mother whom has warrants. I told her she can as my mother is a 50 year old able bodied woman and should have taken care that before so that is on her, whereas my grandmother is an 80 year old whom can not take care of herself, therefore she is my priority not my mom. So, as backlash I am getting yelled at and hated because I did the right thing. I am so mad and hurt and upset and just dont know what to do really.  I changed my number, deleted my facebook and will let the anger settle. My Aunt Has also lied and told my mother that my Grandmother makes too much for nursing homes...what?! who makes too much to be cared for? She has medicade and money, she will be accepted into a few places with no issue...I got tired of the excuses and now I feel isolated but My grandmother's life is more important to me than my family being mad at me.

  **tl;dr**: My Aunt is exploiting my grandmother,taking her money and my mom takes care of her and gets no help. I called social services on my Aunt because she is neglecting my grandmother by not providing the medical care she needs as an alzheimers and they are all mad at me because I exposed them to the state. 


[UPDATE]: Protective Services called me today. They found nothing to substatiate my claims but did insist that if I feel strongly enough about things, I could sue for guardianship of my grandmother, which I have started. If the funds allow- given that I am fighting for custody of my Daughter (we have 50/50 with wonkey holiday schedule and I want primary so it is more stable for her) I am not sure if I can even afford it. I want the best for my Grandmother and if it means that I have to make sure she gets the care she needs, then I will do that whatever it takes. As things progress, I will update on here. Thank you all so much for the kind words. I needed to hear it.

"My (24F) uncle (M51) drive drunk again, hit a guest's (27M) car. My dad (M53) stood up for him, things got bad.


Sorry for formatting or spelling guys, I'm on mobile.

So my uncle is a major alcoholic. We live in a tiny town and he lives about a mile away and tries to drive home plastered every year. Couple years back he backed into my brother's car, gave him a cash payout to fix it, year after that he hit my brother's friend's car, damage was so bad he had to file a claim with insurance since he couldn't open any of the doors on the driver's side. Couple years later it was a rainy new years and he ended up going off the driveway full speed down our tree covered hill and totaling his truck with his wife in the car. That happened and my brother and dad got in a screaming match where he threatened my brother and my uncle just stood there swaying and blinking slowly. Everyone involved was very drunk.

This year we have had it. As soon as I realised my uncle was driving I ran out but it was too late. I heard the crunch. I ran downstairs to the party and shouted who parked up the hill, everyone ran up and my sister, brother and I started screaming at my uncle, who again could barely stand up straight and blinked stupidly. My dad started taking his side and APOLOGIZING TO HIM. Poor precious baby getting yelled at, so we all started yelling at my dad for defending my uncle again (my brother recorded all of this btw) we had to physically pick up the friend's car and move it since my uncle's huge truck was wedged against it so firmly. I had grabbed the keys and my uncle kept trying to grab them back So I backed away and my dad went to try and talk to me so my sister started yelling in his face. All of us sans druncle went to the porch. My dad kept trying to express his point of view, but my sister who is crying at this point goes to run inside. I follow her and a switch flips, my dad shoved me out of the way and went to kick the door my sister was trying to pass through, I stuck my leg in the door to try and protect her and the door slammed on my leg instead of on her. My brother has to physically prevent my dad from running after my sister. I followed her upstairs and we hung out until my mom came up trying to defend my dad. We layed out what happened and she was still trying to justify his beahavoir but absolutely screamed at him when everyone was gone.

Druncle's truck was blocking everyone trying to leave and he refused to get out of the driver's seat (with an open bottle in the car) his wife finally came and picked him up. I was the only one sober so I moved his truck and hid his keys.

Now I'm upstairs the next day in my room not knowing how to interact with my usually incredibly close family, I'm going back to my home eventually, which means having to interact and get this resolved soon for the sake of my mom. I feel angry, upset and my eyes hurt from crying, my sister left last night and my brother probably won't come up from his basement today. How the hell do I handle this?

**tldr: uncle hit someone's car again (4 cars damaged now) my dad stood up for him, basically assaulted me and my sister. What do?**

EDIT: sorry I didn't mention this before: we've tried reporting him in the past. The last time we tried to report him the police took an hour to get there and the officer didn't do anything besides tell him off for trying to get behind the wheel (I wasn't there mind you, I was given this info secondhand)  the police in my small town are absolutely incompetent. When my friend's house got broken into and car stolen they never found the car or person even though she told them who did it. They don't care. "

"Me [30 M/F] with my wife [32 M/F] of 6 years, I'm not attracted to her at all


Been together 8 years, married 6. My wife is wonderful, beautiful, smart, and is a doting wife. Sure we all have our flaws, but overall she's one of those people you would consider a catch. People love her, she's generous, no one has anything bad to say about her, she has no enemies.

That love extends to my family. My parents treat her like she's their own daughter, she's a favorite aunt, she gets along with my sisters.
All of this only makes me feel worse and more guilty. I'm not attracted to her sexually, AT ALL. In fact, she repulses me. I feel like shit.

She has a good body (not super fit, but she's not overweight), she has a beautiful face and stunning features, a killer smile...but it does nothing for me.

When she tries to initiate sex, I'm immensely turned off. I don't want to touch her. I don't want to kiss her, it's even an effort to hold her hand.

We've been going to therapy for this as of course my wife is extremely hurt and just trying to be patient with me in case this is a phase. But I know she can't go on much longer and I don't blame her. She deserves someone who's crazy about her.

I used to be crazy about her. I couldn't keep my hands off her. Our sex life was really good.

This is why I feel so guilty and crazy. It just fizzled out. I have nothing concrete to complain about. She's trying so hard with working out more, buying lingerie, taking care of herself. But I look at her and I just feel...nothing. She might as well be my sister.
To make things worse, I AM attracted to other women and want to have sex. I masturbate fantasizing to other women. I don't want to cheat on her.

If there was a magic wand, I would love to be attracted to my wife again. Divorce would upset so many things and sex is the only sore point in an otherwise great marriage. We get along so well. She makes me laugh, we like the same things, she's my best friend.
I'm really hoping there are some other long term relationship people here who have gone through something similar. Have you ever completely lost attraction for the person you were with but still powered through it? Did it come back? Is it lost forever? Is this why people open up their marriages?

I feel like a piece of shit because she's such a good person, but I'm also incredibly unhappy.

What I wouldn't give to just feel SOMETHING for her. Really hoping to find someone who understands where I'm coming from. Thanks.

  **tl;dr**: Not one ounce of me is attracted to my wife, but she's a wonderful person. I feel horrible. Hoping someone can relate."

"My [34 M] brother in law is creeping me [26 F] out.


My sister [38 F] and my brother in law [34 M] have been married for 15 years.  They have 4 children together. My sister already had 1 when they met.  They met/dated/moved in together/got married in less than a year from the day they first met.  She was 23 and he was 19.  They were struggling financially when they first got married so they lived with our parents for a few years. I was 11/12 when they moved back in with us, so I grew up thinking of him as a blood brother.  My parents never have been fond of him because he has trouble keeping a job, but I never had a personal problem with him until the last year or so.  

Eventually they moved out into their own place and seemed to be doing okay until about 6 years ago when my sister got pregnant with their youngest child.  They had apparently been having major marital issues for awhile unbeknownst to us, and he left her while she was pregnant for a former high school fling he reconnected with. To say my sister was devastated was an understatement.  Long story short, they ended up reconciling about a year later.  Our parents were suspicious about him being sincere, but my sister wouldn't hear any of it.  She doesn't want anyone to bring up the separation. Ever since then it's a big taboo in our family to say anything negative about him to her.

Things have seemed okay for them but in the last year I noticed that my brother in law started aggressively liking ALL my posts on Facebook.  ALL my pics, statuses, etc.  My sister is on FB as well but he RARELY likes anything she posts.  I thought it was weird, but I didn't think much of it until a couple months ago when I used the new Instagram feature where you can make a story (kind of like on Snapchat) for the first time.  

It allows you to see who has viewed it, and I almost fell on the floor when I saw his name.  I've had Instagram for YEARS, and I had no idea he followed me on there or that he even had an account. He's never liked any of my pictures on there. My sister doesn't use IG, only Facebook.  I go to his profile, and he has no posts or even a profile pic BUT he is following over 500 people and ALL of them are porn/booty models. I KNOW my sister would NOT be okay with this considering their history. I'm the only regular person he follows and I don't post anything racy. It's mostly just selfies.  

This really creeped me out, but I was hoping that maybe it was just a coincidence or misunderstanding.  Yet EVERY time I have posted a story on IG for the last two months he is the FIRST one to view it.  I am honestly afraid and unsure of what to do.  

Should I just BLOCK him and forget about it?  Is it that serious where I need to tell my sister?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My sister's husband is liking everything I post on FB and frequently lurks my Instagram from an account that he follows nothing but porn/booty models on.

**UPDATE**  I decided to talk to my other siblings before I went to our parents.  My oldest brother basically said knowing their history, I need more concrete evidence before going to our sister.  I took screenshots of his IG page, blocked him on there, and put him on my restricted list of FB.  I hope that sends a CLEAR message not to f**k with me.  I am going to monitor the situation for the next few days/weeks and adjust if anything changes.

"Former friend (34F) obsessed with my (33F) pregnancy plans


Quick background: Ana and I had been friends since middle school, went to the same high school and college as well.  After two decades of a friendship filled with good times and happy memories, we had a falling out about 6 months ago.  The story leading up to it is long enough to triple the length of this post, so I'll try to sum it in a paragraph.

I've come to realize that Ana is very good at lying to manipulate people, even if those lies involve innocent third parties and may jeopardize other people's friendships with each other.  In fact if you call her out on her lies there is a high chance she will double down and turn it around on you if she can find a way to do it.  I've also noticed that she has a tendency of telling half-truths without context that will make others seem sad, pitiful, or just in a bad situation, while making a show about how worried she is for them.  She is also very concerned about her image and seems to have no qualms about ruining other people's reputations if it will lift her own.  I don't think she used to be like this so while I'm sad things played out the way it did, I feel that our friendship has run its course and am not interested in trying to work out anything.  I had actually started fading out on her as of the beginning of the year -- which she noticed and passive aggressively suggested to mutual friends *and* my face that my marriage must be making me unhappy and how I'm probably too embarrassed to talk about it --  and the fight leading to our falling out simply sped up the process for me.  Since then I've been hearing through the grapevine that she frequently brings me up when talking to mutual friends and insists that the two of us are fine.

Onto the issue.  We both got married recently, and it's been no secret that Ana wants to get pregnant within the first year of marriage.  She's brought it up many times in the past how she can't wait to get married so she and her husband can start trying for kids.  Meanwhile, I simply don't feel the same urgency.  I also think family planning is a private matter between the couple and is nobody else's business unless the couple chooses to share.  If anyone does ask, I usually say something to the effect of, ""Not yet.""  Most people accept that answer and move on, but not Ana.

I saw her once since our falling out, about four months ago at a mutual friend's house party  Within the first 10 minutes of me arriving she asked if I was pregnant (no) and if I plan to get pregnant soon (no).  Apparently the evening of that party she grilled my best friend, Rose, for information about whether I am pregnant because she didn't see me drink any alcohol (I did).  Ana seemed convinced that I am or have plans to get pregnant very soon, and am just hiding it.  This conversation repeats between them a few more times over the following weeks and Rose later tells me about it.

Other than her obsession with my not-baby, Ana also seems to really want to know what I've been up to, asking friends since she can't get the information from me directly.  Normally I wouldn't really care but before our fight I had noticed a trend where I'll say something to friend and like clockwork within 48 hours Ana would start a conversation with, ""So I heard you did X"".  Sometimes she'll just talk about it, but usually she'll subtly criticize me about it or say how she did this other thing that's so much better.  I stopped telling friends anything (which was very stressful and made me wonder about the point of having friends to begin with).  Presumably because she wasn't able to get any info from them, Ana started being obviously overly-positive in her conversations with me, while trawling my social media accounts and asking Rose about things I posted.  I'm not particularly active so I don't know if she realized that she had left a comment on a post I made over a year ago.

I know I can't micromanage what friends say to her, nor do I want to.  The most I can do -- and have done -- is to convey to them how uncomfortable I am with Ana's behavior and ask them to please not tell her anything about me.  I've had long conversations with Rose and another friend through whom most of the ""information leak"" had been happening, and I understand now that they weren't being her spies.  Rather, Ana was just playing the part of a concerned friend to get info on me.  In hindsight I also realized I had been an unwitting as well when Ana was looking for information from me on *another* friend who saw Ana for who she is way earlier and had inconspicuously faded out without causing any drama.

Rose agrees that Ana's obsession is really weird, bordering on controlling, and understands why I feel uncomfortable to the point where I don't want Ana to know anything about what I'm doing or what I'm up to if it can be helped. She has promised to not tell Ana if I do get pregnant, and reminded me to also ask other friends to also not let it slip in front of Ana.  But realistically, I can't expect my friends to uphold a 9+ month secret for me, then at the end a baby will appear and it will be obvious to Ana that everyone was withholding this information from her, even though it's not like she has some sort of divine right to this information.  I also don't want to hide it from everyone like it's a shameful thing just so nobody has to lie if Ana were to ask.  Besides, it's not like I can hide a pregnancy unless I avoid all friends after I start showing.

Ultimately I think the onus is on me to get over my paranoia and find a way to deal with it.  Advice on how to find my zen in regards to Ana?  I'm already avoiding her as much as possible by declining invitations to social events where she'll also be at just so she won't be able to corner me as easily to continue interrogating me about my uterus, or try to infer that I'm pregnant from changes in my behavior (i.e., no alcohol, no sashimi) and then go around telling people, ""I knew it!  Natcho's pregnant!"" which from her behavior, I think she would do even though it has *nothing* to do with her.  Aside from Rose and two other friends who've asked me specifically what happened between Ana and me, I haven't divulged information about our fight to others even though it is as obvious as day that we are no longer on good terms.


**tl;dr:** Had falling out with friend who has demonstrated a trend of narcissistic behavior.  She is obsessed with the occupancy status of my uterus and tries analyzing my behavior to determine whether I am pregnant.  Not pregnant yet, but may be in the near future.  Her actions makes me extremely uncomfortable and I don't want her knowing anything about me, but she is friends with most of mine, and I can't very well expect them all to lie to her face should she interrogate them about whether I am pregnant -- or can I?  Advice on how to get over myself and/or deal with this?"

"My (23M) brother in law's (19M) best friend (19M) hit my car last night and drove off without telling me. Now that I've discovered the damage, he is lying about it.


He had originally said that he knew he hit my car, but didn't see the damage (the damage is extensive, but it was very dark outside so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.) He also is telling my brother in law that his insurance is going to skyrocket if we turn it over to them, but that's not really how insurance works, but it's got my brother all upset with me. His dad does auto body work, but I don't trust him and feel more comfortable going to a reputable shop where they work for money and not the hopes of getting their son out of trouble. 

I've even told him that I'm not upset about the damage, I'm upset because of the lying and trying to get away with it. I just married into the family though and I've always had difficulty getting close to my wife's brother because of his immaturity (they both got arrested for publicly faking a kidnapping, and he's constantly stealing alcohol and getting speeding tickets.) I want for my brother in law to see the light and realize that his friendship with the kid who hit my car is not as permanent as my marriage to his sister, and that just because I demand his friend fix my car the way I want (being through his insurance and a legitimate shop) doesn't make me either of their enemy. What can I do besides wait for him to grow up, and am I handling the situation right?
