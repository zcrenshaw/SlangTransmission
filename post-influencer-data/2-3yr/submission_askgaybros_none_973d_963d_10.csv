"UPDATE: horny 17 y/o


So on my last post (about an hour ago) I was moaning about wanting dick but being underage and closeted. I mentioned that I live in a liberal NYC suburb. One of you told me to first come out, then (once I hit 18) hunt for dick.

I am posting this because I came out to my dad about a half hour ago. HERE'S WHERE IT GETS A LITTLE DREAMY.

I TELL HIM THAT I'M INTO GUYS and he says ""thank god,"" before going on to talk about how he was waiting for me to come out. Here's the best part: He told me that he was BI-CURIOUS when he was younger and how he's had both guys and girls. Apparently, my mom has known about this, too, and was completely fine with it.

After I come out, my dad proceeds to call my mom on speakerphone in front of me to tell her, and she nearly screams before congratulating me and telling me that SHE'S GOING TO STOP BY WEGMANS TO GET ME MY OWN CHEESECAKE FOR MY BRAVERY.

WHAT THE FUCK. This has to be one of the best outings ever. I'm shaking as I'm typing this because I'm so fucking winded right now"
"My friend named his baby after me


Hey guys, so I'm so happy right now and I don't know what to do with myself. 

When my friend first found out his wife was pregnant, we went out to celebrate. In a drunken state he told me that if it's a boy he'd name him after me. I didn't take him seriously. 

His wife delivered the baby last night and I went by this morning to see them. Bear in mind at this point I had long forgotten what he'd said at the bar. 

I asked what the baby's name was, and I heard my name said back to me. It took a second for it to hit but when it did I cried a little. 

Guys this is their first child after trying for a really long time. In fact they were seriously considering adopting or IVF before her pregnancy. I just feel so honored."
"For the first time since I can remember, I saw my reflection in the mirror and thought I was handsome.


Last night I was brushing my teeth before bed, looked up and saw my reflection in the mirror and thought ""damn I'm a good lookin' dude."" It caught me off guard, normally I avoid my reflection because there's always something if not multiple things that make me feel ugly/disgusting.

Last night I didn't get any of that, in fact I couldn't look away for a second. I've done nothing different, haven't gone to the gym, no diets, exercising or anything. I think I've finally reached the point of full self acceptance and my self esteem is through the roof.

Just thought I'd share in case anyone else has had similar feelings. I'm here for ya bros. Keep your heads high and carry on."
"I'm going to receive shit for this but fuck it


I just read some post and one of the comments was about how most muslims are homophobic. The guy got a lot of shit for it.

Why do you some of you feel they need to be so ""open"" and ""accepting""? Islam is homophobic and so are most muslims. That is a fact. The only thing different sects differ on is how to kill gays. Both the Quran and the ahadith are totally anti-gay and pro-gay execution.

Islam and most muslims (in the West and elsewhere) think you're sick and need therapy. They wouldn't mind imprisonment for gay people. Believe me, I'm a closeted gay arab in a muslim family and have to hear the most fucked up shit coming from the community every day. Yes 99.99 percent of muslims are not terrorists but stop idealizing shit.

The Quran and the Bible are not the same. Both are BS but the vast majority 99.99 percent believe the Quran is the litteral word of God. If you doubt it, you aren't even muslim anymore. 

Believe what you want, but don't act like you know better than someone who walks the walk. When you hear from moderate university educated friends that ""they don't mind the Orlando attacks cause it's all a bunch of faggots"" or from your moderate mother who doesn't even wear the veil that ""ISIS is the devil but the only good thing they're doing is throwing gays off buildings"", only then will you understand.

And yes I know Jews and Christians have people with these beliefs too. Matter of fact I've read some rednecks express their agreement with ISIS when it come to gay killings. But at least Jews have Reform Judaism. At least Christians have LGBT inclusive churches. Muslims don't have that. They have some LGBT mosques that have to be hidden for fear of being attacked.

I am an ex-muslim that has every day to fake pray, every year to fake fast and my whole life to fake straight in a ""moderate"" family. Don't come and tell me how ""not all muslims are like that"". Yes they are and some of them don't even realize it."
"Uhhh, my mom just told me if they knew I was going to be gay, they would have just aborted or killed me when I was a baby...


So, I'm 26 years old, but I live at home. I am financially independent, but I enjoy the financial umbrella my parents provide (I'm from an upper middle class family).

I came out to my parents right before Christmas last month and they haven't been taking it really well. Basically, at least once every 3-4 days, they'll tell me to try dating a girl and that I can't really be gay, because ""I never showed any signs"" when I was younger.

Today, my mom was bringing it up again, and she was being very insistent, basically saying that if I choose to marry a guy, she wouldn't want to see me again and won't leave me any inheritance. They said, I can choose the easy route (be with a girl and live a ""normal"" life with kids, stay under their financial umbrella) or the hard route (live in secrecy and shame with a guy, no financial backing from parents). I got pretty mad, so I told her that that was exactly why I never showed them any signs when I was younger, or told them before, before this is exactly how I knew they would react.

So my mom then says, that if I did show them, she would have just killed me, so she didn't have to waste any money or time on raising this useless kid.

I'm shaking with anger right now. 

Anyone got any comforting words or insights? :'("
"Yes, someone would date a guy like you


There's a post like it every day. ""Would you date a quiet guy?"" ""Would you date an Asian?"" ""Would you date someone with an ugly bellybutton?"" 

The answer to any and every variant on that question is fucking YES, someone would date you. Chances are whatever you think is repelling people from you isn't the real fucking culprit. And if it is, that still doesn't mean every single gay man on planet earth is not going to be attracted to it. Maybe one guy will think your freckles are hideous but another will think they are gorgeous. One guy might have no desire to be with someone who only speaks three words a day but someone else is going to be charmed and hang on each of those three words every damn time. I mean literally I don't think there is ANYTHING someone wouldn't do. ""Would anyone date a Serial Killer?"" YES. There is probably some homo diddling their asshole to pictures of Jeffrey Dahmer right at this very god damn moment. 

And yes, someone does share your fetish, no matter how weird or disgusting, so calm the fuck down. 

Also this is maybe the worst place in the world to come for validation that you are, in fact, attractive to someone."
"How to deal with Overheard Homophobia In Jiffy Lube waiting room. Did I do the right thing?


I was  sitting there waiting for my oil change when this guy and his wife walk in and sit in the waiting room as well. On the TV they have the woman's marches all over the country and the world on the news. The guy shakes his head and says. ""When will these women, Liberals, blacks and faggots learn that protesting doesn't do anything but fuck up traffic in the downtown area?"" 

Now normally I am sort of shy. But this kind of got me a bit angry. 

I said that he was mistaken, protesting got us Civil Rights, Labor laws and helped to end the Vietnam war. 

The guy shrugged and said. ""So? This protest isn't going to change anything because Trump is still President.""

I replied that Trump's presidency was not the reason for the protest as much as the anti-women rhetoric: Defunding planned parenthood which is designed to help women, not supporting equal pay for women.... grab em' by the pussy....etc. ""It's more of a respect thing and Trump has not demonstrated much respect for them. 

For some reason this guy got angrier and angrier.  He respects women he has been married for over 18 years to the same woman.... blah blah blah...

Then he says my voice sounds lispy and he asks very directly ""What are you a homo?"" 

This got ME a little angry so I stood up and said  ""yes! I am a butt banging, stool pushing, cock sucking homo! Why? You interested?""

The guy's face looked bright red like he was going to explode. He and his wife walks out of the waiting room and stood outside smoking cigarettes without saying a word. 

As I was leaving I heard the guy say under his breath 'faggot'. And his wife said, ""Just feel sorry for him Ray.""

Now, I am thinking I did the wrong thing. I made it seem like all gays are that forward and childish. Maybe I simply should have ignored him and walked away but instead I stood up and voiced my anger in a childish way. 

Did I do the right thing? Because now I am thinking I may have done more harm than good. "
"When I was in high school I was terrified that people would figure out I was gay.


Told myself gay porn doesn't count, tried to avoid media or anything they had a positive LGBT message or an LGBT person as a part of it. 



Fast forward to yesterday I'm sitting at my desk with my rainbow keyboard and headphones watching RuPaul's drag race while browsing /r/gaymers. Hard to believe I was ever so afraid!



I mean I had good reason to, my fears that my family would disown me came true. But I got through it and made a good life for myself. Chose my own family.


Shit gets better. Gets a whole lot worse, but then it has nowhere to go but up."
"Guys who use Grindr to advertise the fact that they will soon be deleting Grindr: why do you think anyone cares?


This phenomenon seems to be relatively common. Has anyone here done this before? Why did you do it? Did you expect to get a rush of guys messaging you before you leave, kind of like a 'going out of business' sale? Just curious because I find it quite bizarre."
