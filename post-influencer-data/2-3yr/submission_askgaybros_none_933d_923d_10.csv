"It happened at Chipotle.


I was eating at Chipotle with two of my friends, and the first employee on the line asked me what I wanted. I ordered three tacos to go, and the really cute guy winked at me, telling me that I might regret it because people get bitchy when they see who took the last ones. With my friends nudging me, I soon caught on and told the guy to inform angry customers that they could catch me outside. He burst into laughter and told me I gave him the laugh he needed to get through the rest of his shift.

With much encouragement from my friends, I wrote my number on a slip of paper along with the phrase ""I ate the taco shells - cash me ousside"" and waited in line for ten minutes to give it to him. My heart was pounding so hard that I couldn't even look at his reaction! I had to leave and go to the nearby Starbucks with my friends, but they said they could tell it impressed him.

He texted me and we're supposed to go on a date this Friday night.

Keep an open mind - you never know where it may happen."
"[UPDATE] It happened at Chipotle.


He led me on for a few days and acted like he was romantically interested, but he told me yesterday that he's not looking for anything. So we're not meeting up tonight as originally intended.

I'm upset, but I can't say I'm surprised. This is just how my life goes.

I would have linked the original story, but I'm technologically challenged."
"[Update] I asked a guy out and...


[First post] https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5w086o/i_asked_a_guy_out_and/

Hey guys. Wow, I didn't really expect my post to be that popular but thank-you all for the kind messages and egging me on and shit. Some asked for an update as to how it went so here we go :)

Mr Sexy and I had been in contact in the days leading up to our date last night, Snapchatting, messaging and on the phone to one another. We both expressed our excitement for our date. We agreed to meet at 8:30 at this restaurant in the city. I was there at 8:15 and grabbed a seat for myself and held a seat for him. He texts me a few minutes later saying he is running a bit late, but that he's on his way and would be there as soon as possible. 20 minutes later, he rocks up and is apologising profusely for being later. I wasn't pissed or upset that he was late, because he let me know before hand and his apology was sincere. 

Anyway, he sits down and the waiter comes with the menus. We both order and talk some more. Holy fucking shit he is unbelievably good looking. No adjective in the English language can describe him, seriously! Turns out that we have a lot in common as well. We both enjoy the clichés; hiking, gym, similar music tastes and views in politics, life etc. We also come from Middle Eastern backgrounds and had very hard coming out circumstances. 

Our food comes and we start eating and he jokes that the food here is better than at his cafe. I start laughing as I am a little tipsy at this point and so is he. We end up finishing our food and ask for the bill and he gets up to use the ""bathroom"" which I know is complete bullshit as Arabs say this to secretly go and pay the bill. I quickly got up and made my way to the counter to pay to his objection. I said to him that I asked him out on the date and that I feel obligated to pay. He suggested we go to a bar and drink some more as ""the night is far from over"". 

We get to walking and make our way to the bar which is about 10 minutes. We get in and order some drinks for ourselves and grab a booth. We almost can't hear each other from how loud the music is, so he yells for me to come to the dance floor with him. Now, like other things, I cannot dance to save my life. I look like a Neanderthal  when I ""dance"" lol. I have to say he is an amazing dancer too. Another thing he is good at lol. At this stage he is getting a lot of attention from guys and a few have even up to him (which I kinda expected). Without missing a beat, he told them that he wasn't interested as he was on a date and wasn't going to leave me. I thought that was very sweet but told him if he wanted to he could of (these guys were very handsome).

We stay at the bar for about an hour and head out. He is very drunk at this moment and I ask him if he'd like to come back to mine to sober up, or if he'd like me to take him home. His face lit up and happily agreed to come back to mine. We hop in a cab and make my way back to my place which is about 10 minutes from the bar. We head to my room and he is stumbling everywhere. I hold him and lead him to my room where he crashes on my bed. I grab some munchies and water for him to sober himself up on. He sits on my bed and starts to unzip his pants and takes his shirt off. I ask him if he wants some clothes to put on and he says no, that he usually sleeps without clothes anyway. HIS BODY IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE. I lay on the bed and get down to my undies too. He likes what he sees and leans in to kiss me. We make out for a minute or so before I stop him. I tell him that it is something I want, but not when he's drunk and that I would prefer to wait if the opportunity came up again. He smiled and said that he would very happily wait for our next few dates. He asked if we could cuddle and I agreed as I love to cuddle. We switched positions a few times and at one point notice that he is completely naked so I get naked too. He starts to stroke my cock and it's hardening in his hands and jokes if I still don't want it. I really do but it's better for me to wait. His cock is average (thank God). Average cocks are by far the best in my opinion. Check!

We wake up later that morning, both of us naked with all our clothes on the floor still spooning; me spooning him. He asks if he can hop in the shower and I say yes of course. He asks if I'd like to join him, to which I agree. We hop in and start rubbing each others bodies. We start making out passionately under the water and it is amazing. Biting my neck, using his tongue in my ear. Wow. Not much more than that thankfully as he kinda remembered what I said the night before. 

He had to leave to get to work so I offer to drive him if he'd like but tells me it wouldn't be smart as police regularly patrol highways with breathalysers and I would more than likely lose my license. He chooses to take a taxi. As he waits, we keep kissing some more and feeling one anothers bodies. He is a such a great kisser omg. I am definitely smitten over him now. 

His taxi arrives and makes his way to go out before landing a big fat one on my lips. He tells me that he will message me very soon. He messages me 20 minutes later thanking me for the amazing night he had and how I was the best first date he has been on, period. I am ecstatic and jokingly ask if there'd be a second date. To which he said, a second then hopefully a third and fourth. We made plans for next weekend to go on a double date with our dogs. We're going to go to a dog beach together. 

So yeah, sorry if you guys are bored yet. Didn't want to be too vague about what happened with him. I am so happy right now. I just keep thinking about the way he was squeezing my hand when we were cuddling at the kissing in the shower. I cannot wait for date number two next week! Thanks for all your support guys, it really means a lot to me :) I hope you all have a safe and happy weekend :)

Td;lr - Met up with Mr Sexy at a restaurant, went to a bar where he got lots of attention, went back to mine and cuddled the entire night. Showered together and he made his way to work. Date two organised for the following weekend with our dogs at the beach. "
"I asked a guy out and...


Hey guys, this isn't really a question but an interaction with a guy I had a few days ago. I am using a throwaway as I know some family members know my original account. Don't really see many happy posts as opposed to negative ones so I thought I would share my service. This may or may not be long so I will do a tdlr down the bottom.

I had been to this place a few times on my way down to the coast as it is convenient and the food/service was always on tap. A guy worked there who I later found to be the owner of this cafe. One time we made some small chat as I was waiting for my order and he let slip that he and his ex (boyfriend) used to own this business together but had a falling out and are not together anymore. He was a bit flirty with me a few times as well which I found to be cute. Awesome lol.

Anyway, we said goodbye and made my way down to the coast. A couple weeks later, my friend, dog and I went back down to the coast and stopped off at this cafe again hoping he would be there. He was. I spoke to my friend earlier about him and said I should give him my number considering he was into guys. I didn't really want to as I don't think I am in his league, he is really really attractive. I didn't really think he would be interested in any capacity considering...

So I enter the cafe but my dog had to stay outside which I understand. My friend stays with my dog outside whilst I place our order. Who comes out? Mr Sexy lol. We know each others first names, so he greets me and takes over from his employee and getting to chatting again. His smile is so infectious, and is incredibly well spoken. So, he finishes my order and I get ready to leave when my friend messages me from outside telling me that we should stay outside and eat, to which I agree. 

I asked him if there was anything that my dog could eat that wouldn't upset him and he said that he would prepare something for me. He told me to sit and start and that he would bring it out for me when it's ready. About 5 minutes pass and he comes out with this platter of meat for my dog. Like, it is huge. He places it on the table for me and asks if he can pat my dog. My dog is a Pitbull cross so he isn't very often patted, but he is a very placid dog. He starts patting him and scratching his head and my dog is loving it. He then tells us that he too has a Pitbull similar to my dog. He places the meat tray on the floor for my dog and he is just staring at Mr Sexy waiting for me to say the word so he can start eating. He is very impressed and jokes that his dog isn't that well behaved lol.

He has to go back inside but tells me to enjoy my meal and pats my dog again. About 10 minutes later, we finish and I go inside to use the restroom and he asks how my meal was. It was awesome, I replied. There's next to no-one in the cafe at this point and it's just himself and two workers there. I say to him we better jet and that I am going back to pay. He says that it's on the house and not to worry about it. I ask him to reconsider as it was a lot of meat and would've cost him a bundle. He continues to say no. I said okay and that I should at least leave a tip because the food and service was exceptional (every time I have been there). He says that it isn't necessary but I insist. I go outside, say what the hell and figure to write down my number on a napkin. I go back inside, leave a tip and go up to him (he's alone at this point). I can feel my heart beating out of my chest at this point as I am waiting for some rejection. 

I'm there with him and I start to stutter... I ask him, that if he's interested in going for a drink or a dinner some time to give me a call or a message, and I hand him my number. He grins and asks: ""So, do you want to take me out on a date""? I mumbled yes and he says that he will definitely take me up on the offer... What the fuck. I asked him ""really""? And he says absolutely, why not? I am smiling ear to ear at this point. I tell him that I should be getting on my way as my friend is waiting for me. We say our goodbyes and I say: ""I look forward to hearing from you"" to which he replied with, me too.

About an hour or so later, he messages me asking when and where our first date will be. So this weekend, we will be having our first date at a South American restaurant. My friend was ecstatic for me and was so happy I went for it. I cannot wait. I still cannot believe he said yes. We have been texting and Snapchatting non-stop and he is very excited for our date! I cannot wait.

Td;lr: Visited a cafe with a friend of mine that I frequent often and gave my number to the owner of the cafe after a few occasions of flirting and light discussions. We have our first date tonight :)"

"Live in a severely anti-gay country and I'm terrified


Hi guys, I'm a 19 year old guy from Ghana in Africa and I've known that I'm gay since I was like 4 years old. My country is extremely homophobic. LGBT people are either lynched or imprisoned. I've managed to remain closeted all these years and repressed my sexuality. I keep to myself and literally have no one in my life other than my close family. I've lived with depression since I could remember (as one does) but I've managed to stay together so far. I think I finally cracked, I'm in a constant state of panic thinking about my future and how best I can escape the hateful climate here. Last night, I had a ridiculous panic attack and contemplated suicide for the first time. I don't really know what I'm asking here. I guess I want to know if anyone else has been in such a situation and how did you get over it. Just needed an outlet of sorts. Thanks."
"Homophobic idiots going off on Moonlight's win


Saying how being gay is the trend and how you have to play gay to win an Oscar. Excuse me, when was the last time a gay-themed film won Best Picture? Never 

I'm also tired how some are saying how they're using the ""gay agenda"" to weaken the Black male. I guess gay men are at fault for why single parenthood continues to be an issue. If anything, the issue might lie more with trash like Love and Hip-Hop which thrives on presenting stereotypes. 

The reactions I read are proof positive a film like Moonlight was necessary. Unfortunately some will never change, bigotry is ingrained in their psyches. "
"Abusive things my ex did I thought were ""normal""


1. I wasn't allowed to masturbate. Whenever I didn't want to have sex for any reason (tired/school/bottom problems) he would ask me if I masturbated again. I barely masturbate, but he made it seem like I was an addict and it was wrong to do.  
2. He would take my money without permission and knew my card-code even though I never gave it to him. I thought it was okay at first because we have been together for two years, but not when I had to beg him for money when I was late for rent. I realize know I never knew his.  
3. Not telling me when he had to come. He knew I didn't like swallowing and called me a prude when I didn't want to. After a while he just stopped telling me. BB was the worst 
4. He was always high. *Always*. I only saw him 3x a week but he had to drink/smoke weed. It was the only way to be with him so I started drinking more and doing more drugs. 
5. He didn't care. When my grandma died and I called him crying, the first thing he said was, ""oh, I thought *someone* died. I mean she's old"". And refused to go to the funeral because he said my mom didn't like him. That week he didn't call/text/visit because he knew I wouldn't have sex. 
6. Ignoring me and being passive aggressive over nothing. His silent treatment would last for days till I would forget how the fight started. I was always the one apologizing because he was never wrong. This I thought was normal because it was better than we he yelled at me. 
7. Too sexual. 90% when he was over we just had sex. If I told him I had to study or else he would guilt trip me because he was already there, he travelled to see me. He couldn't even hold a conversation without overly touching me. I  thought it was cute at first but it became so frustrating. I feel like I was only there for him for the sex.  
8. Make fun of me. When I would tell him about a topic I was interested in relating to my university course he would roll his eyes, kiss me to shut me up. This was never cute because when he introduced me to people he knew he would always joke, ""don't ask him what he studies, he will bore you to death"". I became used to saying ""you are probably not interested"" to people and I'm still surprised when people actually listen when I talk. 
9. Scare me. He has a motorcycle which he loves. Whenever it was raining or he was slightly intoxicated I would have to beg him to just take the train but he wouldn't listen and not even text when he did arrive. This did get him in an accident that broke his arm. 
10. I was never allowed to top. The few times I was he would do his best to look super bored and then blame me because I was doing it ""all wrong"". His excuse then, ""at least you are a perfect bottom"".  
11. When we would watch a series together, he would watch the next episode himself and then spoil me on purpose. Silly but he just didn't respect me.

These all might seem obvious but he was my first everything and I never went to pride events (he said they were for faggots which is so stupid) or met other gays. I was 18 when I met him, he was 21. I hope if someone else sees these signs, they just leave because it took him hitting me for me to realize what type of person he was. He wasn't/isn't a bad person, he just has so many issues. I can only hope he gets them fixed and doesn't waste 2 years for someone else."
"Test Came Back Positive


Hey guys. I had a HIV test so I could start PrEP and protect myself. Turns out I should have done it earlier. My life changed last Monday morning when the doctor called me and told me my results were positive. I've had a week to deal with the news so far and I'm in a much better place now thanks to my amazing doc and my best friend who I told immediately. I know it's my fault and I should have been safer. It could have been avoided and I think that's what makes me feel so guilty and sad.

 I feel like I've read the entire internet looking up everything I can about HIV. I had blood samples drawn and will get an appointment scheduled with a specialist when the results come back. I know from searching this subreddit this topics get posted occasionally and I could really use the support and hopefully some answers to questions I've been having. My biggest fear is the cost of medicine and doctor copays. I have insurance from the ACA but since I haven't seen the specialist I don't know how much my meds will be (also copay is double the amount for my pcp). I've looked at AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) for my state and hope they send me information soon. I'm also going tomorrow to a local hiv/aids outreach clinic type thing to see if they can help.

I've totally lost all interest in sex and my normally high libido has dropped to zero. I don't even wake up with morning wood anymore. I'm kind of worried about that, even though sex and masturbation is very far down on my list of things. I think it's psychological. If you've experienced the same thing how long did it take you to get back to normal? Sorry to ramble. Remember it can happen to you, be safe and get tested!


**edit:** thanks for all the responses guys, most of them are really helpful. If you don't know your status I urge you to get tested. I know it sounds like a broken record but I literally never thought it could happen to me."
"My dad wants to meet my boyfriend


My dad and I have always been very close. I have two other brothers, but he seems to favor me the most. My gifts have always been more expensive, more thoughtful, I get away with more mischief, etc. My brothers and I could be watching TV, and he would specifically ask me to come join him on the porch, or go driving someplace. 

The sad thing about my dad is, he’s extremely homophobic. Growing up, I got to watch him act disgusted by gay people. I remember when I was 12 we went grocery shopping, and after we left the store, he started mocking the cashier for being effeminate. There’s been many other instances, and that's why I didn’t come out to him until college.  

He took it hard, but shockingly I only got ignored for 3 weeks. When he started talking to me, he wanted to know everything. How long I’ve known, if I hated him, if I was seeing anyone, etc. I told him I had a boyfriend, but what I didn’t expect was for him to ask to meet the guy.  

My boyfriend is slightly effeminate, and I don’t think my dad will be able to handle it. Even while he was trying to act accepting, I could tell from his demeanor that he was still struggling with it. 

What do you guys think? Should I wait until he gets used to me before introducing my boyfriend?
