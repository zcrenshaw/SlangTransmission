"TIFU by getting diarrhea at the beach.


Hey Reddit!

So I've been traveling in Africa for a while, now. About four days ago, I got reeally sick. I was puking all day, had diarrhea, stomach aches... It really sucked. Nothing seemed to help. 

Fast forward to today and still I haven't left my hotel room for more than 20 minutes at a time since I got sick. I was feeling better, but really faint because I hadn't eaten. I had a light breakfast and decided that I was going to go to the beach. I know that a lot of places here don't have washrooms, so I chose wisely and went to a  beach front bar where I was 100% certain that they had a bathroom.

So I'm on the beach, tanning, drinking water, reading... When all of a sudden, I need to shit *NOW*. So I get up and hobble over to the washroom with my butt muscles tensed up as to not leak liquid shit everywhere.

*""Lady! Lady! Sorry, the bathroom's getting repaired right now, you can't go in,""* the bartender explains. *""WHAT NO IT'S OK I'LL USE IT ANYWAYS!"" ""Umm, no you can't, there's someone fixing it.""*

I was desperate, and I told him it was an emergency, and he laughed it off saying, *""Just go in the ocean, everyone does.""* Turns out the closest bathroom was a 7-10 minute walk away...

So get into the water and start swimming out as fast as I can. I get about twice as far as the second furthest person... I look around. No boats, no surfers, no swimmers... ok. 

I pull down my bathing suit and start to let out a massive load of orange pudding-like shit. It creates this DISGUSTING cloud... and half started floating up, so I swim a few meters away with my bottoms still down.

Then... I look down into the water and see there's four fucking scuba divers about 2 meters below me, COMPLETELY grossed out, pointing at my cloud of diarrhea to warn each other and swimming away as fast as they could. I shit on scuba divers. 

I left the beach immediately and now I'm back at my hotel.

**TL;DR: Went to the beach hoping I didn't have diarrhea anymore, desperately had to shit, decided to go in the ocean, ended up accidentally shitting on a group of scuba divers.**"
"TIFU by pissing on a toddler.


Okay so this was a new low for me and I'm Irish so you know that's gotta atleast be a bitta craic.


So earlier today I'm in town playing Pok√©mon Go and I've just came across a poke stop with a lure activated. I have to pee but I figured I'll stand about for a couple of minutes and see if anything cool appears and Christ am I happy when a lvl 932 Aerodactyl appears. I click on the bastard and start chucking balls. Well, I don't know if it was the need to slash or just the game fupping with me but could I catch the bastard? Nope, ten balls ten misses. Each ball I throw seems to curve more than the last and this grey ballocks is flapping his wings at me, Fifteen balls and he escapes twice, One ball left and I hit him, of course he escapes and runs away. ""Fuck sake"" I whisper and realized in my pacing I've heightened then need to pee greatly. So I head for the nearby shopping centre two streets away.



As I approach the corner entrance to the shopping centre I'm about to burst, I've inherited my fathers bladder and at 32 years of age I pee at least 20 times a day and by fuck do they come on quick and fast. I'm practically running at this point and as I reach the door this little kid comes full speed and runs into me, head first into my crotch.



Well I don't need to tell you what happened next but I will because its the whole point of the story, when he headbutted my goolies I pissed, a lot. Wearing shorts this piss flowed down my legs and all over this kid, it was all down his wee shirt and trousers and I was soaked. His mum was mortified and his dad laughed so loud the whole shop was watching, I apologised and explained I wasn't feeling well, I didn't know what to do. Poor kid started crying and I'm stood there just ashamed. The parents where pretty understanding though and apologised for their kid, I think they just pitied me, I would. 


I walked the two miles home in piss drenched shorts and foot wear and cursed the entire walk.


At least in future when that kid runs from his parents they can say ""do you remember what happened last time?"" and he'll think of that giant ginger bearded wanker who pissed on him.


Fucking Aerodactyl.




TL;DR : Decided to try and catch a pokemon instead of going to the loo, ended up pissing on a kid who ran into me on my way to the toilet.


EDIT: Which one of you sick fucks gave this post a golden shower? Thank you, I'm glad my misfortune can cause some laughs! "
"TIFU by peeing outside in Thailand


This just happened a few minutes ago and my legs should be renamed Pompei.

Im visiting Northern Thailand, and my resort courtesy shuttle driver had to pee, so he pulled over, and since I needed to go too, i got out as well.  Thats where it all went wrong.  

The driver pulled over near a canal, and i jump out of the van and go down to the waters edge thinking I would be out of oncoming drivers eyes and turn my body so the driver cant see me either, since hes doing his thing about 15 feet from me. I pull out Lil' Wang and start to flow...it was glorious...then I feel some movement on the hairs of my legs, so i look down expecting to see mosquitoes....nope.  I had just waddled into the largest ant colony I had ever seen.  Within the maybe 5 seconds I had been standing there, these fucking monsterous fire breathers had already covered my legs to the point i could barely see my ankles.

I immediately start to jump up and down on alternating legs while I'm swatting at both ants and mosquitoes with my one free hand. I eventually let go of my dignity and use both hands to scrape the layers of biting ants off my legs while unsuccessfully ceasing the golden flow.  The van driver is laughing his ass off as im hopping up and down and halfassed running up the hill without pulling up my pants screaming ""oww oww oww ants fucking ants!!""  

To add insult to injury, my lovely fiancee is in the van scolding me from afar telling me i should have known better and that i shouldn't be waving that thing everywhere.  

Im back in the van now, covered in my own urine, and my legs are on fire.  Every few seconds it feels like im being bitten again randomly on my feet.

TLDR: jumped out of a van to pee, stood in a fire ant nest and gave myself a golden shower...

Edit: Wow this blew up...front page even.  Thank you Reddit for the love."
"TIFU by Asking a Girl Out


So there's some things you have understand before I start this story.  I'm in grade ten of high school (this happened in June, so about a month ago).  I am an incredibly anti-social person.  Up until this point I have never even tried to ask a girl out.  This was my first time EVER.  So I walk up to her, absolutely terrified, and just before I say anything, I trip on a crack in the side walk and land right on my face.  I get up instantly and try to play it off, blood gushing out of my nose.  She is freaking, and I'm stumbling around mumbling ""its okay, I'm fine, I'm fine"" when I fall for a second time, this time backwards, cracking the back of my head against the sidewalk, knocking me out cold.  I wake up in the hospital a few hours later, luckily with no serious injuries, except maybe my pride.

TL;DR Tried to ask a girl out, ended up in hospital"

"TIFU by slamming my daughter down onto the ground.


I enrolled my kids in karate class about a month ago. Since I had to stay there with them while they practiced, I figured that I might as well sign up too. That way we can practice together at home and I can keep them motivated by being in class with them. 

Last night at class we were practicing a move that we learned not too long ago. Our teacher paired me up with my daughter to practice the move together. I pretty much have the move down, so I went through it pretty fast. Unfortunately when it came to the throwing part, I didn't hold her up high enough during the fall, so I ended up throwing her down for real. 

Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing and looked at me in shock. Of course I was apologizing to my daughter and making sure that she was ok. But our teacher was not happy about it at all. She...corrected me and basically told me not to let it happen again.

My daughter is ok, but a little bit sore. I feel like a total piece of shit about it. And nobody is letting me live it down either."
"TIFU by kissing the wrong girl in front of my girlfriend.


I've been dating my girlfriend for a couple of weeks now and for the first time we were both off work on the same day, so we decided to make a day out of it and spend some time together. Her parents are abroad for holidays, her sister is at work and her brother is with his friends, so she was home alone, bored and wanted to hang out, go for a run, get some food.. You know, just have a day out together like any normal couple would. So when I arrive at her house, I see her walking across the driveway towards her garage.. She hasn't spotted me yet, so I decide to sneak up behind her. I get close, and then in a _borderline rapey sneak attack,_ I just quickly grab her by the shoulders, turn her around and kiss her. After I pull away she's got a shocked look on her face, (obviously I've just nailed it and she wasn't expecting it at all.) 

""Umm.. What the fuck?""

""Oh shit."" (I haven't nailed it all, she didn't like this)

I then hear the hysterical laughter coming from behind me as I turn around and see my girlfriend laughing really fucking hard because she just witnessed me kiss her identical twin sister, who was just at home for her lunch break. I'm trying to keep it together and explain my fuck up to her and it was an honest mistake, but she just continues to laugh and eventually told me that she opened the door to greet me, but when she saw me walking behind her sister in the opposite direction, she decided that it would be hilarious to see how it panned out.

Luckily she got a laugh out of it and nothing bad happened, we're still together. But in that moment I instantly thought that the relationship was done for. 

Moral of the story; If your significant other has an identical twin, never try to surprise them.. Probably better off ~~murdering them~~ making sure they're not around, first."
"TIFU by thinking I could outsmart a Scientology stress test administered by a Scientology Auditor on an e-meter.


Ok, in this instance ""today"" is 25 years ago. To cut to the chase, I am well on my way to recovering from this FU but it took a very long time, with the help of some very good people. 

25 years ago I was a high school Junior attending one of the many high schools in Albuquerque, NM. Most campuses had an open lunch policy and me and my friends would often travel to a local Wendy's located roughly at the intersection of Menual and Wyoming. At this time the Church of Scientology had a Dianetics center in the adjoining strip mall (Hoffmantown Center). Every day at lunch there was an odd, sloop shouldered man who would hang around the Wendy's asking the mostly student customers if they were interested in improving their academics, athletics, he would ask if we wanted to improve our relationships with our girlfriends (or even get girlfriends), our relationships with our parents and teachers. 

I was pretty much the typical picture of the late 80s/early 90s high schooler, somewhat athletic, suffering grades, smoked a little weed, drank at the bonfire parties held on the mesa every weekend. But I was also probably smarter that I gave my self credit for and I always felt like something was missing. I also thought I was pretty funny and street smart (as much as kid from the NE Heights could be). 

One day we were at the Wendy's and the Dianetics guy came up and sat next to us. Thinking we were being funny, we started goofing on him about his clothes, his odd glasses and hair style (think David Koresh with less charisma). As I look back on it, we were vicious, way more vicious than we should have been but it didn't seem to affect him at all. He let it roll off his back and still offered to help us discover all the things that were holding us back, that all he needed was an hour of our time and he could show us our endless potential. We finished lunch, he said something like ""maybe next time"" and I remember I got a big laugh from my friends when I said ""I seriously doubt it Skolnick"" as we were walking away. 

Maybe a week later we went back to that Wendy's and sure enough he was there. He again approached us with his standard spiel, but this time emboldened by my buddies and the ribbing we gave this guy the last time, I agreed to take his stress test. So did another of my friends. I just knew for a fact that I would get in there with my friend, we'd get some off some hilarious jokes with each other and we'd finally get this poor nerdy guy to snap and let it show that we had gotten to him. I had no idea what a stress test was but I figured that whatever it was, I'd be in and out in an hour and have a great story for my friends about how I'd snapped the poor fucker. 

We were so convinced that we were going to work this over, my friend and I decided to ditch 5th and 6th period and do our stress test. We walked over to the strip mall with this guy and again he exuded a strange calm while we mocked him from behind, my friend even gave him a ""flat tire"" then kicked his shoe into the parking lot while I tried to not laugh uncontrollably. The Diantics guy dutifully picked up his shoe, put it on and continued walking. He unlocked the door to a very unassuming but mostly blacked out storefront and he immediately said that my friend and I would have to do our stress test separately and that if we could be patient he would have another auditor on the way. Well shit, I thought...I could skip classes but if this ""joke"" leaked into baseball practice, I would not get to play that coming weekend. I said this to the guy and while I didn't know it at the time, this was his first clue into what vulnerabilities he would play into later. 

My friend and I agreed and I decided to go first. We walked into a seperate room that looked like it was a movie set from the 70s that would be labeled as ""office, unassuming, not comfortable"" on the script. There were mustard colored vinyl chairs, wood paneled walls, musty and frayed carpet and a laminate desk between the seats. On top of the desk was an electronic device with two soup cans (literally) attached to wires coming from the device. 

He sat me down and asked me to pick up the cans. His first question

""what is your name?""

I answered. 

""what is your full name?

I added my middle name. 

""was that always your name""

I said no, I was adopted by a step dad when I was a baby.

""What is your name?""

I said the name given by my step dad again. 

""What is your name?""

Every time I would answer he'd jot down a note on a big yellow legal pad. 

""What is your name?"" He asked again. 

Just wanting this line of questioning to be over with I answered with my birth name. He seemed to nod with approval at something on the e-meter and moved on. In that session he asked me about secrets I'd been keeping from my parents, he got it out of me that I really wasn't happy playing baseball because the coach wasn't giving me enough playing time, that I was an under achiever in school, that I had zero luck with girls because I was too shy around them. As the session was winding to a close, I absolutely remember him looking right at me and saying ""come back, and I can get you more playing time."" I asked him how, that would probably require him talking to the coach. He said he would love to talk to my coach as well, but that the power to get more playing time was within me. Looking back... all the swagger I walked into that little office was gone and I was looking forward to my next auditing session. I was hooked. 

I spend the next ~22 years as a dedicated Scientologist. I don't have any of the truly exotic stories of abuse of power because I never joined the Sea Org and was a relatively detached member. But I did spend a small fortune on Scientology services, I dutifully believed that the church had changed my life for good.  In my 20's I married another Scientologist, had two kids and am currently going through a bitter divorce that is ripping my kid's lives apart because their mother still insists on having them in the church while I want them out. Her legal bills are most likely being paid by a Scientology benefactor (my lawyer is trying to figure this out). 

I rubbed elbows with true celebrities in the Celebrity Center in LA, I got to attend events that have now become youtube famous for their creepiness and disconnect with the world at large. I am lucky in that I was able to start and maintain a successful business (largely with help from the Church and it's networks at the beginning, I have to admit) and am not dead broke, but I have seen well off people reduced to a lifetime diet of ramen noodles because of the expense and expectations of the church. If I were to total it out, I would guess that I've spent $115,000 on services and donations to the church. That number compounds if you add the services and donations in the name of my wife and kids. 

I'm lucky that my parents never abandoned me, had I joined the SeaOrg (which I considered doing prior to having kids, but was discouraged because my business &lt;in other words; donations&gt; was ""too important"" to the church at large) I would have lost track of them as well. They have helped me come to terms with the time I spent in the church, they still love me and still fight to see their grandkids (current state has a grandparents rights statute in divorce cases) and most importantly allowed me to keep a foot in the outside world. 

This fuck up will never truly end however as I get near daily calls and emails for donations from the church. I get a forests worth of direct mail asking me to come back and experience the new auditing techniques or to take a tour of Flag Base in Clearwater. Worst of all, unless my soon to be ex-wife also ""blows,"" my kids will forever be exposed to the Church of Scientology. 

tl:dr: 25 years ago, I fucked up thinking I could outsmart a Scientology Auditor. I spend about 22 years and well into the six figures and exposed my kids to a life time of Scientology because...no...I couldn't outsmart a Scientology Auditor. 

Edit: wow this really blew up but I imagine it's winding down now so I should have edited this earlier. I've actually run into several people from Albuquerque I knew in high school...that's crazy. No I didn't go to Sandia, we would just go to that particular Wendy's because no chance of our teachers or admin staff being there.

I didn't make this clear but in the first writing but my mom and I were abandoned by my real dad when I was an infant. I have a great step dad who really sacrificed a lot to take us on, however when my little brother was born my step dad treated us very differently. About this time (I was 9) I was told he wasn't my real dad and that my real dad had tried to get in touch with me. So pre-teenaged (and teenaged) me seethed with resentment over both being abandoned (real dad never showed up for his promised meeting--have no idea where he is to this day) and thinking I was treated worse because of biology. As someone said below the auditor was doing a cold reading basically and either the meter really did jump or he read my reaction to the name question and took me off guard by going down that path. Had I answered ""yes, that's my real name"" he would have gone to something else. I should have made it clearer why this had such a big impact on me.

And to by far most common question, I did not get any more playing time. I actually really hurt my knee at the end of junior year and could never generate the power in my swing after that...I actually sat most of senior year and any long shot college prospects I had were long gone."

"TIFU by wearing an apron on my head.


This was a few hours ago.

I work in a kitchen, so one of my duties is to clean the hood vent housing biweekly. I usually take pride in the job, because I know no one else does it as well as me.

Anyway, I also have pride in my hair, and I hate getting grease and cleaner in it while I'm up there, so like usual I grab an apron and tie it around my head like a bandanna. I always do this, so I was not expecting what happened next.

As I was cleaning near the air shaft which was pulling air, it yanks my apron off my head. I yelp and scream to my coworker, who looks up at me in confusion. He is dumping grease from a drip tray into a tiny hole for disposal; a precision job if there ever was one. The next second was a series of banging from the fan, followed by  me screaming at him to turn off the fans. The next moment was him dropping the grease all over the floor and running to the switches on the wall (not where the fan switch is). What followed was him flicking on/off all the lights, while yelling ""in the office!""

The fan is off, and there's grease all over the floor, while I am still wearing normal shoes while waiting for new non-slips to arrive. We tried retrieving the apron but Solid Snake must be fucking anorexic if he can fit through the vents. We ended up giving up, I called my boss, and I hope it all gets sorted out in the morning, hoping I keep my job or get that raise I wanted still...

TL;DR - Tried to be Solid Snake, ended up with Liquid on the floor. Fission mailed.

Edit: Good lord, the upvotes. Love you all /r/TIFU I'll update after my scolding tomorrow. Good night. &lt;3**

Edit 2: I go to bed with 140 upvotes and wake up to 1600. Seriously. &lt;3**

Edit 3: I just only had breakfast. 2k? and Gold?! (Edit 3.5 - Front Page too. o_O) Wow, misery does love company. Restaurant's been open for a while, haven't received any bad ~~codecs~~ calls/texts. About to head out and receive my OSS (On Site Scolding) soon though. &lt;3**

Edit 4: [Snuck out to do this edit.](https://imgur.com/wNE53wJ) The Boss is on an off site mission. Got a scolding. Will update more with pics when ~~Shalashaska~~ Otacon arrives for the closing shift. I work 11 hours with strict no phone policy. &lt;3**

Edit 5: I'll fix the brackets when I get home. I'm no good with Reddit mobile. I have a short break. Apparently we shut the hoods off in time. The Boss' SO pulled out a shredded greasy apron from the roof, so all is well now. Was expecting to get yelled at. Got more of a disappointment chat. Heartbreaking. I keep my job, but I don't think I'll get a raise. I'm ok with that.

People seem to be misunderstanding the office's location and the kitchen's size. We are a small place. The office is 3 steps from the range. We clean the hoods weekly. We do NOT have a deep fryer, which is why the hoods are not done daily. Also the greasy mess was not big. It's just a litre. It was a minor pain but still gross. When we close up I'll share pictures of the whole thing. &lt;3**

Edit 6.1: I just got home. It was an unexpectedly busy night. Formatting and blurring pictures and videos to protect the innocent. Then I can put this TIFU to rest 'til my next post (deciding between the car fu or umbrella fu). Seriously, thanks for everything guys. It started with one fan, then having at least 3000 more made my day.

Edit 6.2: The imgur links begin.

TL;DR for updates: Apron was extracted from roof, I keep my job, shoes ruined.

"TIFU by doing the splits


This happened yesterday. I had gotten prescribed a muscle relaxant called ""Baclofen"" as a result of a recent car accident. I took some yesterday. I was at the park and had been sitting down for a while so I decided to do some stretches. To my amazement, I could reach my entire hand around the bottoms of my feet- usually I can barely only touch my toes. It also felt really good to stretch. I started stretching out in various different ways. 

At one point I had one leg stretched straight out to the side and I was reaching over with my hand- basically a ""one leg split"". I got he bright idea to see how it would be to just go ahead and put the other leg out. I did. To my amazement, I could stretch down within maybe 3 inches of the ground. I was practically doing the splits!

Hours later it became apparent that I had made a huge mistake. My legs were feeling wrong. 

Turns out I pulled the muscles on the insides of my thighs in a pretty bad way and now it hurts to walk. I just couldn't tell that my muscles aren't ""actually"" that stretchy while on the Baclofen. 

FML. 

Edit: Update: 

By fortunate coincidence I happened to have 3 days off work in a row, which practically never happens. The incident happened in the morning of the first day. So I've been able to stay off of my feet since this happened. My legs are feeling 75% better now, about 48 hours after the incident. I have work tomorrow, I'm hoping I have fully recovered by then. "
