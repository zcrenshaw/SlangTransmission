"TIFU by accidentally dosing myself with LSD at work.


Throwaway.  Well it was around noon when I ate my pasta.  Shortly after that I found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.

TL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office."
"TIFU by ejaculating in my bed


Throwaway obviously. This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.

So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.



I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. 



So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.

TL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation"
"TIFU I accidentally proposed to my girlfriend waking up from appendix surgery


Not really a fuck up, more just an unexpected suprise. So on Friday I woke up at 7:30 a.m. with abdominal pain. My girlfriend of 7 years told me to stop moving around so much and went to work. I was rolling around for about 3 hours until I realized that my pain was getting more localized in my right lower quadrant area. Since I work in the medical field I knew right away it was going to be an expensive day. So I grabbed my phone charger and went to the hospital. Was immediately checked into the emergency room, got a CT scan and was told by the doctor that I needed my appendix out that day. So I was admitted into the hospital, my parents and girlfriend came. They were by my side as I went into the operating room. When I came out of surgery and was in pacu, both my girlfriend and my parents were there waiting for me. Working in the medical field I knew that people my age (30 years old) say some crazy things from anesthesia but I didn't realize how crazy it was going to affect my life. When I started coming to, the drugs/anesthesia affected my judgment and i made a life-altering decision. I looked at my girlfriend, pointed to her instead, ""I WANT TO MARRY YOU!"" right in front of both of my parents. She was in shock, so she turned to my parents and asked him if I was being serious or if it was just the drugs talking. They reassured her that I was serious because I had ""mentioned"" marriage to them in the past. So she said, ""of course I will"" and my parents said,"" welcome to the family"", then they all hugged. So yesterday I purchased her an engagement ring and the wedding planning has begun. So I guess the moral of the story is, sometimes it takes having less guts to have guts to do something?

Tl;dr got appendix out, proposed on drugs, I'm engaged

Edit: Holy shit, front page? Really? Haha. A little background story, i was joking around in the comments. She waited until I was 100 percent first to make sure I really wanted to do it. I have discussed with my parents multiple times that I wanted to marry her also. My parents aren't grandbaby crazy, we don't want kids. I love my girlfriend and coming out of surgery made me realize how fragile and short life really is. No more fooling around. Thanks for the gold and front page!"
"TIFU by forgetting 5+ years of college education in a moment of weakness


Here we go, friends. This FU did in fact happen today. I am currently curled up on my bathroom floor, spooning my toilet as if it were my highschool sweetheart about to leave for war, because of a moment of idiocy that occurred about 5 hours ago.

For some necessary backstory, I am a recent college graduate with a degree in nursing. I had a little too much fun in college, so it took me 5 and a half years to graduate. Being that it took me almost 2 years longer than it should have to obtain my degree, I am currently drowning in student debt. Also, I recently discovered that due to a clerical error, the dental insurance I thought I had under my parent's health insurance was cancelled last year. So when my dentist told me a few months back that my wisdom teeth were growing in at delightfully awkward angles and would need to be removed, I scoffed a pathetic little scoff and decided to hold off until next year, when I could get dental insurance through my work. 

Flash forward to 3 days ago. My right wisdom tooth begins to hurt. Like, REALLY hurt. Like, the worst hurt that I've ever felt in my 25 years of life. My mouth begins to swell. It swells so much that I begin to have trouble opening my jaw. My jaw becomes so tight that I can barely fit a spoon in to my mouth. I am resolved to essentially sipping soup and broth all day, at which point I call my dentist. She says that it sounds like an infection that resulted in lock jaw. I cave in and schedule a wisdom tooth extraction, and am prescribed 10 days worth of antibiotics, as well as some medication for the pain.

As any freshman nursing student can confirm, a common side effect of both antibiotics and pain relievers is nausea/vomiting. To avoid this, it's recommended that you take these medicines with food. I am so desperate for relief when I go to get my medicines that I completely overlook this information that I had engraved into my eager student brain 5 years before. Y'all see where this is going? 

I pick up my medicines and enthusiastically take them all at once, on an essentially empty stomach. What resulted was a violent vomiting episode that hasn't been seen since the Jello Shot Nightmare of Freshman Year. I hope you never EVER have to experience the pain of vomiting while simultaneously having lock jaw. It was indescribable. The icing on the cake, though, was having to call my super-nurse manager and explain that I would not make it in to work today as I was experiencing a completely avoidable side effect of my medicines, and am thus probably unfit to be a nurse.

TL;DR forgot how to be a nurse when I got lock jaw from a wisdom tooth infection, may never leave my bathroom floor again. SOS.

Edit: I just want to thank you all for the overwhelmingly kind/supportive comments, and for all of the advice on how to alleviate the pain. You all have really brightened up an incredibly lousy day. I'd smile larger but, you know, the lock jaw and all... ;)"
"TIFU Stepping into an Acid Cloud


This actually happened several years ago. We had a problem with the scrubber on an hydrochloric acid (HCl) tank. The scrubber neutralizes fumes from the tank to allow expansion within the tank without leaking HCl fumes. For some reason it would go bad after 2-3 days and had to be replaced. The consequence was an acid cloud that would sink to the nearby road.

The person responsible was our health and safety manager, who for some reason would not fix it. He was not local, but would visit the plant once a month or so. The guys knew to stay away from the tank, but one day the wind was right and it blew the cloud to a more active area. One of the guys said it was like those gaseous clouds in Star Trek trying to chase him down.

So I confronted the health and safety manager, said someone would get hurt if they didn't fix it. He told me he'd fix it when he got to it so I told him I'd talk to his boss. He was 6'6, maybe 275# heavy weight lifter and an academy graduate, so he wasn't used to people threatening him in any manner. He got really mad but he did finally bring in an engineering firm to fix the problem. We fixed the scrubber again in the morning that they arrived, he asked me to show them the scrubber.

So I went to the walkway above the tanks, opened the door above the hydrochloric tank and stepped out. My lungs instantly froze when I began to breathe in the fumes. I turned around to waved my hands to try and stop the health and safety manager from going out since I couldn't talk as my lungs had seized, but he tried to go around me. I put my hands on his chest to try and stop him and he starts pushing me like I was trying to pick a fight. So I let him step out and stopped the 2 engineers from going out, who looked confused as to what was happening.

I'm bent over, wondering if this is how I die and the health and safety manager comes back in. He's right across from me with a scared look on his face, watching me. My lungs started to work after maybe a minute so I got behind him and patted him on the back to try and get his to work as well. Which they do and we both are coughing. I told him that was why I was so concerned about the situation. He gets a look on his face like he came to a realization and said oh, you were trying to stop me from going out there. I pointed out, did he really think I'd suddenly turn around and start a fight?

tl;dr Safety feature on an acid tank failed and I stepped into an acid cloud. Lungs seized for a while.

EDIT: Wow, more than doubled my post karma. I should do one about the time I almost died from breathing cyanide next :p.

EDIT 2: Thank you to whoever gave me gold, my first ever.

To the people who think I made this up, if I was the sort that made up stuff to gain karma I would have reposted something from the front page before now. I only had 23 karma going into this, and have been a reddit user for several years."
"TIFU by battling a nest of nyc sewer roaches. (nsfw language)


*Edit - Thank you Anon for the gold!

I'm finally past this enough to write about it.  I've been rattled by it for days... and I don't rattle easy.  This will be long, and I apologize in advance.


Preface:  I'm renovating an old brownstone in Brooklyn.  These are row houses, all connected to a common and old-as-the-city sewer system.  Earlier this week I decided to try shore up a vertical section that had sagged, and broken some of the retention straps that reinforced it. Luckily this was on a branch of plumbing we weren't using, but still.  I'd be bringing in a plumber to do the actual fitment work, but this, I felt, couldn't wait, as it was an absurdly large cast iron stack weighing hundreds of pounds.   (8"" pipe out to the street which is about double what is really needed for residential.)
.

So lets paint the scene. I'm wearing a cheap-o led head-lamp, which is at best pretty dim.  20-30 lumens, tops.  The basement is very dark and shadowy, with a few bulbs, off in the main part of the basement, and that's it. This pipe is coming down from several floors above, and is in the darkest corner of the basement.

I'd been noticing some ""water bugs""  (a polite name for the largish flat american cockroach that often inhabit basements.  Different from the brown, german roach that will invade your cabinets, but no less gross. )

Now, to keep things in context - ""some"" to me at this point was more than one, alive, at a time.  So - several is a more accurate description.  Nothing infestation level. Several. A few. A handful..   Given the age of the house and how long it's been empty - not unexpected.

I hate bugs, by the way.  I've broken bones, had wounds deep enough to require multiple layers of stitches, and was hit with the gut wrenching realization that human flesh smells like hot dog when cooked, by unknowingly grabbing a freshly welded piece of metal.   I'd rather go through any of that again, than have a bug of significant size crawl across me. (shudders) - My irrational fear here will maybe explain some of the poor decision making you're about to read.

So anyway - As I start attaching a retaining strap to the lowest portion of cast iron pipe stack, I hear it.  I'm not aware what I am hearing, but I'm hearing something. We'll get to that in a minute. 

I'm crouched inches away from the stack, about to stand up so I can bear hug this thing into place and relieve the strain it's been putting on the supporting brace and other straps.

Ever play a horror video game? Where you have a flashlight as your main or only source of light? How you have to scan slowly, with only a small field of illuminated vision?  That's my lighting situation down there, in this corner.

There I am, face about a foot away from this pipe, with a small cone of light as my only sight-line. As i raise my head upward, revealing a small portion of the pipe at a time, something is off about what I'm seeing.  My brain just isn't putting it together - so i adjust my headlamp a bit and lean in a bit closer, looking up along the length of this pipe - pitch black becoming suddenly illuminated in a slow reveal as I sweep my sight and light across.  That's when I realize I'm seeing shadows. Time itself slows.

Shadows of antennae. Hundreds of pairs of dancing, twitching antennae - exaggerated both in size and apparent movement against the wall behind the pipe by the stark directional light of a head lamp LED.  It also occurs to me what I've been hearing.  That white noise, barely audible.. the rustling of leaves, etc...  that was the sound of these bugs.  

What was likely just a few seconds stretched on for me until i actually felt myself ""snap out of it"" and I jump up and backward, away from this small corner of hell.

I'm not okay at this point. I slowly withdraw to regroup.  I hate bugs.

I locate a big ass jug of bug defense spray (intended for keeping yard bugs out of the house.)

I locate my brightest flashlights. 

I prepare for battle.

Steeled for what i have to do - i head back down and re-evaluate the situation.  Okay, there weren't really hundreds of pairs of antenna - just a few dozen. The bugs were clearly just hiding on the back (dark) side of the pipe because i invaded their space with my LED light. Realistically - how many can fit behind there? And they weren't THAT big - maybe 1-1.5"" long or so.  
I can do this. 

The bug spray is just a hand sprayer attached to a gallon or so jug.  I tentatively give it a squeeze, aimed in the general direction of the back of the pipe.  I still need to wrestle this thing into place, so I'm hoping to scatter these few dozen bugs so that I may continue the repair.  I'm still not prepared, clearly.. but i had no idea yet.

So anyway - i spray a single shot, tentatively.

Fucking. Apocalypse.
    
With a few thousand lumens of light on this pipe now, the bugs with nowhere to go or hide, and some asshole spraying an irritating chemical at them - they erupt from behind the pipe.  They start dropping down to the floor. The rustling which was barely audible earlier, is now frantic - and my fear response is lighting up. As i start squeezing that spray trigger with more urgency, I have only one thought:

""What have I done""

I could have, and should have walked away. Gotten something stronger to deal with this. *Hired someone qualified*... but no - there I am spraying the shit out of these bugs with something that only barely seems to be killing them, slowly.

Then I see it.  

As I work my away around the side of the pipe, with all the extra light I've brought - from a different angle I can see that the pipe had developed a large gaping crack, running almost the length of the pipe. It's wide enough to fit a hand (flat) through it. 

I'm not simply fighting a few dozen bugs hanging out on the backside of a pipe - I just declared war on an unholy army of direct-from-the-nyc-sewer-system roachbeasts. 


...So I spray a few shots directly into the hole.


So, hey - remember that scene from The Mummy, with Brendan Frasier?  When the scarabs swarmed in ocean-like waves and devoured people?

This was kind of like that.  The previous response i had triggered was a puny apocalypse.  Very tiny indeed.

Bugs.. nay, angry roachbeasts from the seventh level of hell... are spewing out from inside the pipe at this point. They're forcefully ejecting themselves from this sewer main pipe, and due to the inconvenience of being cramped quarters with nowhere to go - they're all around me.  Under me.  On. Me.
I'm spraying and stomping and spraying and stomping.  I'm sweating like crazy. I hear my own heartbeat in my ears. My fight or flight response is at full throttle.  I may have been screaming - I can imagine some combination of terror screams and war cries.  I was alone, so this is completely unverified - but let's assume I was screaming. And spraying. And stomping.

My forearms are burning from squeezing this damn trigger by now(and switching hands as i get tired).  My breathing is heavy.  I'm wearing down.

So - remember Game of Thrones - the epic battle scene at the wall from a few seasons back?  The war drums. The battle horn.  When the Wildlings brought their GIANTS AND WOOLY MAMMOTHS?  

Yup.  So my barely effective poison juice that I've been spraying in and around the pipe must have worked it's way down to an as-yet unknown layer of the netherworld - which brought forth the giants desperately trying to escape that pipe of mild discomfort.

Now, my friends from down south will tell me that a two-and-a-half, maybe three inch ""palmetto bug"" is pretty fucking normal - but not to this city boy they aren't. Watching these things emerge from a pipe as you're fighting a war to save humanity itself is pretty damn demoralizing. 

I'm ready to give up. Let them take me. I imagine myself being slowly devoured by these giant bug beasts.

It's at this point that my logical brain takes over from my emotional one, and i start grabbing newspaper, rags, and anything else i can find and start stuffing the crack.  I stem the tide of bugs coming out of the pipe, and concentrate on the ones that are now wandering aimlessly, slowly, across the floor.  More stomping and spraying, but less screaming.
The spray WAS working, eventually.  It wasn't strong enough to kill instantly, but did kill. This will become a source of regret - but i'll explain in a moment.

With the adrenaline rush gone, and dying roaches carpeting the basement, I finally have enough presence of mind to ask myself - what the hell am i even doing?  I grab some duct tape, a big piec of carboard, and hastily start taping it around the pipe/crack. I pour the remaining part of the gallon directly into the pipe, close it all up, and go upstairs.
I didn't talk the rest of the night.  My wife, when she came home, knew something was wrong, but didn't prod too much and let me be. I was rattled beyond measure.  Just typing this out made my skin crawl all over again.  She laughed the hardest she has in a long time when i told her the story the next day but I wasn't totally okay for a day or two.

So fast forward a little - the gift that keeps on giving. Seems like this product is a slow, long lasting killer.  4 days out now, and I'm still finding dead or dying roaches.  I clean them up, come back later, find more... repeat. The rate is slowing down - instead of a couple dozen every few hours, we're down to about 6-8 emerging over night. 

Haven't called anyone in to replace the main yet, because now that i see the severity of the crack, that changes the way i'll need to approach it.  I'll have to open up some walls upstairs, and I'm betting the entire stack has to be replaced, roof to basement. I've decided instead to enjoy my long 4th of July weekend, and mentally recover before revisiting.

Thanks for reading.

TL:DR - Started what i thought would be a basic project in an old house. Ended up fighting a horde of giant roaches from an open sewer main."
"TIFU by inducing vomiting in my puppy, thinking he'd swallowed a poisonous substance.


I found him chewing at a packet of silica gel, and since they often have those ""Do not ingest"" warnings, I panicked and thought they were poisonous. I though it would be rapidly absorbed into his bloodstream, so I instantly gave him a teaspoon of salt to make him throw up, and he threw up *violently*. I had a flight to catch just afterwards, so I had to miss it to rush him to the vet because I thought he'd die. Anyway, once we got there, the vet told us that silica gel isn't toxic to dogs, and that he was just a little dehydrated because of the vomiting. So now I'm booking another flight, and my poor puppy is giving me the stink eye because I think he knows I was responsible for his troubles. 

tl;dr: I forced my dog to puke out a substance I thought was toxic but wasn't actually so, leaving him dehydrated. I also had to miss my flight and take him to the vet because I mistakenly thought he was going to be very sick. 

Edit: [this is a picture of him](https://i.imgur.com/bbLrYjq.jpg)

"TIFU by falsely reporting that my car was stolen


My wife and I drove separately to church on Sunday but left together in my car, intending to pick up hers later in the day. Fast forward to tonight (Wednesday) and we still had not made it back to pick up the second car.

So finally tonight I call an Uber when the kids are asleep and sure enough the car is not in the parking lot. I Uber back home and call the local police department, they had no record of it being towed so I report the vehicle as stolen. They send two officers to my house to get my statement, I'm stressing about insurance coverage and feeling shitty for not just getting it sooner.

It's 11:30 and I'm getting into bed, and I make some comment to my wife about how they had the parking lot locked up... her: ""I parked on the street, not in the lot"".

So I fucked up by not confirming where the car had been parked or walking the 50 steps to check the street before getting the police involved. Sorry for wasting your time officer Ortiz!

So I just took an Uber back to the church and the car is right where she left it. I called the police department again to tell them my mistake and they made it very clear that I should not get in the car because it is still in their system as stolen. I'm currently sitting outside at 1am waiting for a call from the officer to give me the go ahead to drive home.

TL;DR: didn't know where my wife parked the car, reported it as stolen."
"TIFU by accidentally tricking two teachers into thinking I was bleeding from both eyes and nostrils, causing one to faint


Obligatory this happened roughly 14 or so years ago. Me and my friends were quite the pranksters in middle school, nothing too serious. The most we ever got in trouble for was using a chain to lock everyones bikes together, there was a snitch amongst us. 

One day in cooking class we find a bottle of red food dye and get the bright idea to go around the school yard at lunch and he would run at me yelling ""You stole her from me!"" And graze past my cheek on the opposite side of our spectators and I would turn my head and apply the dye slightly in my nose and let it drip. Holy shit did this get the most genuine concerned looks. People rushing over, girls crying, people pushing my friend back, and then the reveal. And then the laughs, the confusion and sometimes anger.... we did this one more time and decided to do it one more time since my face started to look sunburnt. We find a good sized group of people, we decide to go out with a bang and set up, but were unaware of the two teachers walking behind past the crowd. As my friend shouts ""You stole her from me!"" Everyone turns, I step up my game and apply the dye to my eyes and before I can even look up this poor, poor lady is screaming her head off, crying and promptly fainting. Addrenaline kicked into overdrive and I froze in place, not saying a word, shaking uncontrollably though. Freaking everyone out even more as my friend tries as hard as he can to explain what is happening.

The paramedics show up and my vitals get taken followed by some mental sanity questions. I ask about the teacher and all they could tell me was that she was alright. The teacher was on leave for 3 or 4 days and seemed perfectly normal. I had to write an apology letter and read it out loud in front of herself, my parents, the principal and the counselor.

TLDR: Used red food dye to trick a teacher into thinking I was bleeding out my eyes making her faint, causing the paramedics to be called."
"TIFU by eating edibles at work


So this was actually last Wednesday to be clear. I work at a tire shop. About two months ago a customer came in after her vehicle was finished and asked me if I would take some weed brownies if she brought them over. I said well yes of course ! I even told my boss and he just laughed it off. Fast forward to last Wednesday I'm sitting on a stack of rims eating my Korean BBQ for lunch. She walks in with a bag of brownies sliced into small square cubes. I divide them amongst my two coworkers evenly and I eat one piece (she advised one piece would be plenty.) the smart guy I am. I waited bout 15 minutes and said jeez these are weak ! So I ate about 4 more pieces. Two hours later I might as well be a vegetable. Can't even speak a full sentence. Got hit in the head with the hood of a balancing machine so hard that I literally went to the bathroom mirror to make sure I didn't have a huge dent on my scalp. Could barely do any work and grew more paranoid by the minute. Could not wait to go home. Also at the end of the day I as having a smoke with my manager and I told him I ate the brownies at lunch. He was pretty mad, but I figure I'd tell him because my eyes were as red as the devils dick. 

TL;DR I underestimate the power of weed edibles at work, almost lost my head and my job. Sorry if this was a boring story it was entertaining IRL and I thought it would read better "
"TIFU by rinsing my contacts with acid before putting them in


TL;DR I washed my contacts in a weak acid before placing them directly on my eyes, then cried a lot before throwing them away and using a fresh pair. 


I use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for my contacts overnight. I always let them sit for at least 8 hours. The acidic solution cleans them better for me, which is why I switched a few years ago. The instructions clearly say to leave them in solution for at least 6 hours for the lens holder to neutralize the acid and prevent what must be equivalent to using Tabasco as an eye dropper. 

Now, I always let them sit for at least 7 hours. But, near the end of the bottle and lens holder lifespan (should change holder with bottle as it loses efficacy) the solution doesn't always completely neutralize so it's recommended to give the lenses a bath with neutral lens solution. This morning, in my haze I grabbed the hydrogen peroxide instead and gave the lenses a nice acid bath and inserted my left contact. 

Everything was on fire. I wanted to gouge my eye out. Eyes, nose both running, I start sweating like a cold beer on the beach, I was cursing like an animal... I could barely open my eye to reach in and get the devil's lens out. 

Finally got it out and threw it onto the counter, washed my eye with normal solution, cried a bit, then bathed both contacts with normal solution for a long time, before trying righty. Same situation. Decided to call it quits on those lenses and just get a new pair, after standing in the shower with my eyes open for a few minutes. 

An hour later, both eyes still puffy and watery and I look like I got super high before coming in to work. 

Pro tip: if you use the hydrogen peroxide solution, keep your bottles in separate locations to avoid the worst morning you'll ever have.
