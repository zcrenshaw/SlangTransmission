"TIFU by ruining a movie shoot with Jennifer Aniston


Disclaimer: This should be, ""several years ago IFU,"" but I'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events I've ever caused.

I had plans to meet up with some friends in Atlantic City for the weekend. I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

I parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.

That is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I'll be in it?"" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, ""ACTION!""

I start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""I'm not suposed to be here, am I?"" He immediately shook his head no.

So, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. I think to myself, ""if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

I make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn't screw anything up!

After a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they're blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!

Only at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells ""CUT!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

Turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, ""Uh, I'm sorry."" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

TL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation."
"TIFU by smoking cat feces.


So me and a friend were going to go smoke some weed outside as his wife won't let us do it in the house. But it is a rather chilly day here in Missoula, so we went to a large shed connected to the side of the house. It was normally lit with a shop light, but my friend had taken it out earlier to work on his car. He went off to get the light while I loaded the bowl. He was taking his sweet time so I went to take a hit and realized I had dropped the dense nugget of weed on the ground. I picked it up and reloaded it, and took a big rip. I didn't get anything from it so I broke it up a little bit with my fingers. Hit it again and I got smoke but it tasted foul. I chalked it up to this being some old stuff I found in the dresser. I rip it a third time and get a huge cloud that makes me gag. About then my friend comes in and plugs in the shop light. He points at the floor ""Hey there's some weed on the ground"". I look down,  see the weed, see the pipe, see the pile of old dry cat shit and realized what I had done.




TLDR: It was dark and I smoked cat shit.


edit-Hey front page now everyone knows I'm an asshole.

edit #2-As long as a lot of people are reading this I wanted to say peace and love to everyone no matter who you voted for."

"TIFU when I accidentally tried to steal a MacBook at the airport.


Obligatory TIFU didn't happen today, but back in January.  My wife and I went to Orlando for my birthday. The actual trip was great, if a bit colder than we expected, but still a fantastic time. Until we got to MCO to fly home, that is. 

We got there with tons of time to spare, but it was packed and security was a nightmare. We get up to the metal detectors and X-ray machines and unpack all our crap into bins, and start the process of going through the security checkpoint. My wife goes first and gets pulled aside for an invasive further screening leaving me to gather our mass of belongings spread out in the bins. So I grab my MacBook and cram it in my wife's purse, her carry on, her shoes, belt and coat. My hands are nearly full at this point, but the machine just keeps spitting the bins out and the people behind us are pissed at the delay, so I start fumbling to grab my bag, shoes, belt and wallet, my 3ds and oh shit, I almost forgot my MacBook.  I'm way overloaded, but the people behind don't give a damn so I try to shuffle to the side to wait for my wife to get done with her screening. In the process of doing this I drop about three quarters of the crap I had and so I begin organizing things a bit, putting my MacBook in my backpack with my 3ds and wallet, rearranging all my wife's  things so that I get it down to a manageable amount. Oh shit, I almost dropped my damned MacBook so I decide to hold it directly in my hands until my wife can help me with our junk. 

Well, while I'm doing this, the woman behind me starts shrieking that her laptop is missing, that she can't find it and it was just here before it went through the machine. She comes up to me and tries to snatch my MacBook out of my hands, but I flip it around to show her my piranha plant sticker and prove it's mine. She goes back to flip out at the TSA guy working the X-ray machine and my wife comes up and we proceed to schlep our stuff into the food court area down the way. 

We grab some food at the Ruby Tuesday's and I tell her about the woman trying to take my MacBook, which gave her a good laugh. I surf the web for a little bit and decide to pack the MacBook away for the flight and when I went to go put it in the computer pouch I always keep it in, there was already a MacBook there. It all clicked at once what must have happened so I go to return it to the woman. I get back to the security station and she's pinned to the floor in handcuffs, bawling her eyes out, because she was apparently getting arrested for assaulting a TSA agent. I didn't know what to do so I sheepishly walked up to one of the cops that was handling her and said, ""Uh, I think I grabbed her laptop by mistake"" and handed it to him. Through her tears she bawled out that I was the thief and the cops should arrest me not her when one of the cops said, ""Lady, he just brought this back to you, if he is a thief, he's the worst damned one I've ever seen."" 

I didn't know what to do so I said sorry a couple of times and the cops shooed me away, so I left, and flew home. I don't honestly know if she was arrested or not because I can't find anything about the incident online and I have to believe that the local paper would have written about that sort of misunderstanding, but she was in handcuffs last I saw.

TL;DR:Grabbed a second MacBook in a moment of confusion and caused a woman to flip out and assault a TSA agent because she thought someone had stolen her laptop."

"TIFU trying to be a nice person


This morning we had guests at camp that were lactose intolerant so my manager decides to get the guy some soy milk out of her own pocket, I have never had soy milk before, never tasted it and have never seen what it looks like outside the box

This is where the fuck up comes in, I ask her if I can please pour some into a cup for myself to try, I do and In my head I'm thinking ""what the fuck man, shit looks disgusting"" so chunky and thick, it just looked awful, so I go ahead and begin to drink it and that's when it hit me, anyone who drinks soy milk is not fucking human and clearly lacks the sense of taste 

I realize that because I have started I have to finish it, I mean my manager bought this out her own pocket and I can't be wasteful and throw it away, I don't want to be rude either so I just go ahead and down that fucker, my life flashes before my eyes but I carry on drinking it, man I swear I even had to wipe away a few tears. 

Few moments later my manager walks to me and said ""I thought you wanted some"" I say to her that I have already taken, she then points to show me the box is still closed, I then point to the box I drank from and she bursts out laughing, ladies and gentlemen I had drank only god knows how old soy milk that was standing for only the heavens know how long, and I drank that demon down like my life depended on it 

EDIT: decided to give a TL;DR because of certain complainers, read the post. "
"TIFU by nearly destroying a multi-million dollar water treatment facility


Happened so recently that I am soaking wet while typing.

I will try to eliminate all of the technical jargon that I can. Yesterday I was given about one hour of training on how to properly operate and maintain a groundwater treatment facility in New York City. The engineer who designed, built, and operated the facility had quit without giving notice a few days before that and my company was scrambling to find a replacement so I volunteered. Today was my first day working there solo and even though I was in over my head I decided to just roll with it.  I am fairly new to my company and want to impress.

The day starts off simple enough, check all of the hundreds of gauges and connections to make sure all of the pressure is correct, as if I know what the correct pressure should be on any of these gauges and connections.  One of them seems particularly high, however, so I call up the chain to see if that is normal. It is not. They recommend that I backwash the carbon filters (run a portion of the system backward.) I don't know how to do that, but as I am so eager to prove my worth I tell them that I'm on it.

I close off a bunch of valves, flip a whole lot of switches and head over to the carbon tanks.  Seems simple enough to me. Disconnect the hoses going one way, attach them the opposite way=backward flow.

I disconnect the first hose, and it fucking explodes off of the tank. It is spraying everywhere and flailing around like an untended fire hose.  I am completely covered in contaminated, untreated, carcinogenic, bone dissolving, chemical filled water.  No one should ever look and the chemicals that are in this water and I now have them in my mouth and eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I stand there in shock for far too long and I am instantly soaking wet as If I had just jumped into a pool. I run over to the hose and grab it, try to just reattach it and can't.  The water pressure is far too high for that.  Run around closing off valves, doesn't seem to be working. Try again to reattach it, because I'm an idiot, and that still doesn't work.  Now there are warning lights flashing in every color of the rainbow.  All my valve turning has royally fucked things further, but I keep closing valves because the hose is wildly thrashing about and smashing into delicate equipment. There are now several inches of water on the floor of the plant.  I keep closing valves to stem the flow of water.  The sound of the metal hose striking metal instruments is drown out by sirens, several of them, each indicating that some other area of this plant is about to explode. I assume warning sirens are worse than warning lights.

Finally all of my valve turning is successful. The water stops, and I reattach the hose.  I almost celebrated until I remembered that I am standing in a solid foot of water, sirens are screaming in my ears, and the combined light of all the warning signals is burning out my retinas.

I will spare you the boredom of me troubleshooting every light and siren and using a shop vac to clean up all of the water. It took almost the whole day. I got everything back to normal in the end, except for a few broken things here and there and decided not to tell anyone. My boss called to ask how the day went and I said fine.  I didn't know that there is remote monitoring of this facility though, so everything that went wrong was recorded by the system's computer and could be accessed at the office. He had seen that things were decidedly not fine and I have to sit down with him on Monday. I'm concerned I might lose my job for lying about what had happened.

TL;DR I am incompetent but incredibly confident and nearly destroyed a groundwater treatment facility with the very water it is supposed to treat. Then I lied about it and was caught. May be time to get my resume in order.

Edit: Hey! Turns out I'm an arrogant asshole! For clarity, this is not a facility for drinking water so don't worry about turning your taps. The system treats contaminated groundwater which is then discharged into the sewer line. During all of this the groundwater was contained within the plant as well so there's no need to report to the DEP.

Edit #2: I'm not going to jail, I'm not subject to fines, and I wasn't fired. Sorry, I know that a lot of you were looking for blood. I, of course, admitted to all wrong doing and that I handled the situation terribly. Management can see that it was unwise to send someone inexperienced and untrained into a situation like this.  Sadly, there is no CCTV footage of me running around like Mr. Bean.  Going forward I am sure to be more cautious.

This has been an interesting ride. A lot of your comments had me shitting my pants over the weekend so I pretty much ran away from reddit and wasn't really engaging or answering questions.  I've been on this site for a little over a month and this is one of my first post on this or any website so thanks for sending me to the front page so fast.  Hopefully if I make it there again it will be for something I am proud of as opposed to being a negligent dick.  Thanks everyone!"
"TIFU by causing a school wide panic for 5 minutes


I am in a sophomore metal fabrication class. Today was the first day we actually got to try out oxy-fuel cutting. When it was my go to turn on the torch, I put too much of one gas, not really sure if it was acetylene or oxygen, and when I lit it with the sparker it made the loudest sound I had ever heard, like a popping sound, like a gunshot. Right next to my right ear. There are classes next to the metal fabrication shop and at least 2 girls could be heard screaming from one of them. 30 seconds later the school goes into lockdown due to gunshot, the metal fab teacher had to call down to the office to explain what had really went down. There were cops and a swat team outside the school, at least that's what my friend said. My right ear is still throbbing. Thinking about switching electives. 

Tl;dr - lit a torch improper, sounded like gunshot. School went in lockdown for a good few minutes 

Edit: Holy shit! Got a lot more reception than I thought I would! Thank you everybody for the advice. I would have replied to all the comments but this blew up faster than I could reply. "
"TIFU by donating $60 to Goodwill.


Last fall, I put on my jacket and inside the pocket I find the gift-to-yourself that forgetful people often do, a folded up $20 bill. Years ago finding a forgotten bill in the pocket of a par of jeans would mean an exciting day of thinking of what to do with the windfall. Usually it meant a case of beer for the lads. For today's me, it kicks off my day in a brighter mood which inevitably positively affects the rest of my day. So once spring rolled around, I thought I would gift my future self by hiding a $20 bill in three separate coats. As it started to grow chilly again, I decided to purchase a new, better coat for the winter. Also on the decision list was to donate 3 coats that I had worn forever to Goodwill as they were still in great shape. Today, I found a bill in my jean pocket that gave me an idea to hide more bills for future me. Present me eventually realized what past me had already done, and now the donation receiver at Goodwill probably just had a great day. 

Edit: It sounds like the cash will either go to a good cause, or be found by someone who may need it. I certainly will not call for it. "
"TIFU by trying to ejaculate and defecate at the same time


This TIFU actually happened about 20 minutes ago. I finally was able to clean up the mess.  Throwaway because of reasons.

So I am still a student going to Uni. My parents let me live with them still because my University is about a 30 minute drive. Anyways, It was a really stressful week and what better way to unwind than to bop my bologna? I had been sitting in my room trying for a while but kept being interrupted because privacy is a foreign word in my household. I decided I would go to the bathroom because my parents wouldn't bother to walk in on me handling my bathroom business. I figured since my parents were fiddling around with some electrical stuff in my hallway, I would go to there bathroom farthest from them in the house. Easy mission right? Do the deed, flush 'em down the toilet and we're done, right? Wrong. I also felt a  disturbance in my stomach. I needed to relieve myself in two ways now.  I had remembered reading a post once where someone said that shitting is one of the best feeling in the world so I decided I would try to shit and orgasm at the same time. It seemed like a great idea at the time, mostly because I figured it must somehow stimulate the prostate. 

I was ready to reach my climax. I had a shit queued up. As soon as I felt myself ready to orgasm, I pushed and sent my load of crap out. It was a strange feeling. I felt like I had left myself, but it wasn't entirely pleasurable. The horrible scene that awaited me when I came back to reality. 

I some how managed to send my seed all over my mother's beautiful floral forest wallpaper. Now this was shocking for me, mostly because I never really launched a load like that, mostly just gross dribbl- Never mind. Not only was the wallpaper covered, but my pants and underwear. I also noticed that I had diarrhea. Since my anus kept contracted as I orgasmed and I pushed out diarrhea at such a force, some of it ricocheted back at me hitting me, which isn't the end of the world, and also managed to somehow creep out from under the toilet seat and seep down the side. 

Reddit, please don't ever try to shit and cum at the same time. It's not worth it. No reward for a lot of work.



TL;DR: I tried to reach ecstasy, but only managed to send my seed all over my wall and have my shit seep onto the floor.

"TIFU by trying to ruin my vision


So this fuck up actually happened happened today, going against usual TIFU fashion. I'm currently in the Philippines taking welding courses in order to get certifications to take back to the states. I honestly suck at it but that's bedsides the point. I had just gotten done grinding down my work piece and I make my way to a work booth to begin my weld. I should preface this by stating that I always wear headphones during class to cancel out some of the noise, so I'm thoroughly distracted most days. I strike the rod (giggity) against the piece and get started, all is well I'm really not paying attention. I lift up my mask and grab a tool to chip away the slag and I notice that I can't focus correctly at what I'm staring at. I close my eyes for a bit, does nothing, so I close my mask and try with that and it helps some. I restart my weld after cleaning away the slag as best as I can. At this point I'd paused my music and after about five seconds I notice the arc is much brighter than it is normally and I realize my fuckup. My mask is auto darkening like many of my classmates, except I can adjust a few settings; delay, sensitivity, and more importantly, darkness. After grudging my piece down earlier I forget to turn the knob back from grind to a higher darkness setting, giving my retinas a good tan in the process. 

TLDR; distracted fucker can't turn a knob, almost cooks his eyeballs"
"TIFU by forgetting how Google Docs works while applying for jobs.


I've been looking for a job for the past two weeks, and I found about nine places to which I wanted to apply. For each, I wrote a nice introduction email, attached my resume and a cover letter to it from Google Docs, and submitted it. All well and good, or so I thought. 

After I wrote my introduction email for the ninth potential job, I opened my one and only copy of my cover letter and tailored it to the specific job I was applying for, as I had done the previous eight times. 

It was only after I sent the email that I realized something crucial. When I attached the cover letter to the email, I wasn't attaching a new saved copy of a cover letter like a saved document in Microsoft Word, I was actually sharing a real-time link to the one-and-only cover letter in Google Docs. 

The same cover letter that I had been changing nine times for nine different potential jobs. 

Horrified, I went into my Sent Mail folder, pulled out the very first job application email I sent out and clicked on the Google Docs link to the cover letter. What popped up was the latest updated version, written for the ninth job application. 

Somehow I don't think I'll be getting an interview for any of the previous eight jobs. 


**TL;DR: I didn't send out nine individually changed and saved copies of my cover letter to potential jobs, I sent out nine links to one singular cover letter in Google Docs that I changed to fit each job as I applied for it. As a result, the hiring managers for jobs 1 through 8 will only see the version of the cover letter I wrote for job 9.**"
