"TIFU by brake-tapping a cop


so this happened about 45 minutes ago while i was driving home from work. Im going down a rural road at about 85km/h (speed limit is 80). When this guy in a blue ford focus comes flying up behind me and instead of passing he rides my tail so close that if i stopped for any reason he would have smashed into me. So me being me, i give a polite brake tap (not actually slowing down, just a warning not to follow so close). 

Turns out it's an undercover cop with a dashboard light strip (which isn't visible unless turned on) and he immediately pulls me over then screams at me for driving too slow and break tapping. I argue i was driving the speed limit and i didn't actually slow down when i tapped my brakes. 

256$ ticket for ""careless driving"" ...so i guess i fucked up by dealing with a cop on his bad day.

Holy guacamole, i cant beleive this went crazy over night...thanks everyone, i think ill try to fight this ticket!"
"TIFU by not proposing to my girlfriend.


Last week my girlfriend and I went on vacation in Stowe, Vermont. We decided to go for a walk. As we were walking, we came across [this large open field with a stage in the middle of it.](http://i.imgur.com/MXfgsn5.jpg)

ME: Oh they must have weddings here. This is really neat!

***She points to a bunch of flower petals on the ground*** 

HER: Oh yeah! Cool!

***I start humming that classic wedding tune as we walk hand in hand down the field*** 

ME: da-da-DA-DA da-da-DUH-DA!

***We finally get to the stage, which is empty aside from two chairs and a small box.***

ME: Woah, a ring box! Someone must have left it here.

***I bend down to pick up the box. My girlfriend stands in COMPLETE SILENCE looking shocked. On one knee, with a ring box in my hand, I open the box facing my girlfriend to reveal-- an empty ring box***

ME: See? Huh, too bad it's empty! Still pretty neat though.

HER: ...

***I suddenly realize everything I just did and what it must have looked like*** 

ME: Oh....Oh...Shit. Sorry.

HER: I hate you.

Oops. I ended up keeping the ring box though...it was pretty neat.

-------------------------

**EDIT:** To make matters worse, this is literally the fourth time something like this has happened.

**Time #1:** Last Christmas I made her a DIY kit and individually wrapped all of the parts (yarn, glue, stamps, glitter, cards, etc...). I wanted her to open up the smaller gifts first because I was really excited about some of the big stuff. She asked me what she should open first, so I grabbed the smallest box I could find (it was just a rubber stamp...the size of a ring box) and jokingly said something like ""I know it's what you've always wanted""...Oops.

**Time #2:** Our friend had just returned from the International Space University in France (it's a real thing). He graduated at the top of his class and they gave him a medallion in a jewelry box. I called my girlfriend into the room with the box closed and said something stupid and yeah...Oops.

**Time #3:** My girlfriend started an etsy shop so I had a custom stamp made of her logo. I was excited to surprise her with it and ended up texting her the day it came in: ""I have a big surprise for you when you get home!"". When she finally got home I told her to close her eyes and put out her hand...Oops.

-------------------------

***TL;DR:*** The Universe game me the perfect proposal and I shit all over it.


-------------------------

**EDIT #2:** Woah-- She isn't going to leave me...she knows how much karma I bring to the table. No way she's gonna' let ***this*** go.

**EDIT #3:** [She left me.](http://i.imgur.com/dS9Utgw.png)

**EDIT #4:** loljk. Her seeing [stuff like this](http://i.imgur.com/JMtYVgx.png) has warmed her numb little heart more than breaking up with me ever would.

**EDIT #5:** ITT -- People who have never dated a rational human being with a good sense of humor.

**EDIT #6:** We are engaged

**EDIT #7:** Oh, sorry. I accidentally hit **save** too soon. What I meant to say was *""we are engaged in debate over which of the four fuck ups was the worst.""*...Oops."
"TIFU by blowing a burp in my dogs face.


This Happened a few days ago. My dog, pouncer, is a half shih tzu, half poodle. Both breeds aren't that bright, old pouncer was left with a double dose of the stupid. I love him nonetheless, he's all i have. Every day i come home from work he's elated to see me. He's always been nervous and has some attachment issues.

After eating dinner i wind down on the couch, iron chef is on. Not the good one, the american one. It'll do. I lie down, pouncer lies on my chest, head near mine, all is good.

With out notice, the ghosts of my dinner come up to haunt me. Really it's my own fault, i shouldn't have thought nandos was an adequate meal substitution. No one should have to think that. I exorcise the faux-Portuguese demons from my mouth directly into poor pouncers face. I swear i didn't mean to. Pouncer perks, looking puzzled. He snouts out air a few times then freezes. Now he's looking at me and i'm looking at him.

I don't think i need to explain what happened... But i'll do it anyway. He threw up into my face. Not on, not around, into. The vomit traveled up my nose so far, i swear i could taste it. Within milliseconds i start to throw up. Whilst gasping for air, spicy nandos vomit is traveling back down into my lungs, scarring my insides. I run to the bathroom, strip down and have the most uncomfortable shower of my life.

As i leave the bathroom to go clean the ungodly mess left in my house, i find pouncer is happily cleaning it up for me.

He's all i fucking have.

**TD;LR:** blew burp in dogs face, dog threw up in mine, i threw up in his but he was ok with that.

EDIT: ok ok poodles are a smart breed. Obviously pouncer didn't inherit any smarts from that side.

**EDIT:** front page. This isn't my finest moment, but i guess it'll do. I'd like to thank all those who made this possible. Nandos, pouncer, especially pouncer but mostly nandos. Thanks.

EDIT: for the love of god i know poodles are a smart breed now. Mines just got a real bad case of the dumb-shits. I guess he inherited it from his own

EDIT: thank you for the gold! If i had only known cross-species, two-way vomiting was the secret to gilding, i would have tried it sooner."
"TIFU by blowing $10,000.


Today I fucked up, big time. I have been trading currencies for around 3 months and was getting good results (maybe beginners luck who knows). I decided to go the next step and borrowed $10,000 from the bank so I could put on bigger trades and hopefully get bigger profits.

After a week I made $4,000 in one day (in a few hours) in a great trade. After that I thought I was invincible and kept getting bolder and bolder with my trades. Needless to say today I lost it all, including the $10,000 which I borrowed from the bank. In one day. Gone.

I'm 28, casually employed and have no real assets. I feel like my gut has been wrenched from inside out and I also had to break the news to my girlfriend whose birthday is just around the corner. 

Pretty huge fuck up, one of the biggest in my entire life. 


**Edit:** Surprised at all the feedback I've gotten in such a short amount of time. All the troll comments are making me laugh, at least that is something positive out of all of this. Important thing is to remember no matter how smart or safe you think you are we are all humans and make mistakes or stuff doesn't go our way. It's the way you deal with it after that counts. Cheers for all the comments."
"TIFU by getting drunk the day my grandmother died


So, this didn't happen today. It actually happened March 27, 2009 on the day that my grandmother passed away. My grandmother, 81, had been in declining health for the last 4 years or so, mostly from her developing emphysema. I remember her having to do these breathing treatments multiple times a days and it really sucked knowing she never smoked and still developed it. That being said, she was a wonderful woman who made amazing whiskey cakes and ended up passing away at the age of 81. 
I was 17 (obviously not old enough to drink at the time) and I received the phone call after school that my grandmother was not going to make it through the day. I hauled out to her house to find that about 20 family members and friends were there along with hospice. I was the last person to arrive. They ushered me inside and brought me into her bedroom where she was laying in her bed. I was told she was no longer able to move or speak and all she could do was listen. I held her hand and all I could do was tell her that I loved her. I stepped out and shortly after she passed. Everyone was on the porch crying and I remember thinking how weird it was that I couldn't cry like everyone else.


This is where the fuck up happens. About an hour after she is taken away from the house and most people have gotten their crying out, everyone leaves except my uncle and I. My uncle, who has also passed since this, grabbed the last two beers out of her fridge and shared one with me while we talked about my grandma. Those two beers passed rather quickly and we both wanted to continue to drown our sorrows. Well, my grandmother used to make these ""whiskey cakes"" (I suppose they are the equivalent of a rum cake but with whiskey) that were fantastic. She would use a little bit of whiskey in her icing mixture and it would really set it off. I happened to be around for the last whiskey cake that she made and I knew where she hid her fifth of Johnny Walker Red. I dug out the bottle from under her kitchen sink, hidden way in the back behind cleaning supplies. My uncle and I continued to sip on it and share stories for about two hours until I ended up black out drunk. I don't even remember getting up out of the chair on the porch but apparently I told him that I had to piss and went inside to the bathroom. When I got in there, I guess I decided I had to shit so I dropped my pants and sat down. Now, what I'd like to say happened was that I slipped when i went to sit down on the toilet, hit my head on the tub and knocked myself out. Realistically, what probably happened was that I passed out while trying to poop and just fell forward onto the floor. Either way, there I was: passed out on the bathroom floor, pants around my ankles, and I ended up shitting all over myself. 
I was unconscious for a good while, at least an hour or so. My uncle had wandered over to my dad's house and I guess forgot about me. By the time they realized where I was and had gotten the bathroom door pried open I had rolled over and smeared shit all over the bathroom floor, gotten it on my hands, on the bathroom wall, and in my hair. They woke me up and got me into the shower. I remember being so confused (this was my first time ever being black out drunk) and wondering what was going on. My dad swears I started yelling that SOMEONE had shit my pants and I was trying to not admit that it was me. Anyways, I got cleaned up, went to bed, and woke up the next morning praying that it was all a dream. It was not. They still give me hell about that. In fact, that story was publicly told at my wedding two years ago. At this point it doesn't even bother me anymore; I wear it like a badge of merit (The story that is, not the shit.)


Tl;dr: Got blackout drunk at my grandmother's house after she died, passed out in the bathroom, and shit all over myself.


***
Edit: RIP inbox (and Maw Maw). Thanks for the enthusiasm guys! Glad I could make everyone chuckle at my shitty time. Since this one did so well, I actually have one other shitty story that I think I'll do next weekend. If you read that one too, you'll see that there seems to be a theme between alcohol and my defecation. On a completely unrelated note, the wife does not approve of me drinking as much anymore.


Edit 2: Holy shit my first gold! Thanks so much u/2faymus


Edit 3: For everyone who has asked, I will get the recipe for her whiskey cakes from my stepmother and post it on here. I should be able to get it within the next few days and get it up before the week is out.


Edit 4: HOLY SHIT I MADE THE FRONT PAGE!


***
Edit 5: Here is the recipe. I only ask that when someone makes it that they take pictures, post it in r/food, and drop my username so I don't miss it. 

The whiskey Cake Recipe:


1 box yellow cake mix (without pudding)

1 box instant vanilla pudding

4 eggs

1/2 cup oil

1 cup milk

1 shot whiskey (1 and 1/12 ounces)

1 cup walnuts


Combine all ingredients. Mix for 3 minutes. Pour into a well-greased tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-60 minutes.


Topping:

1 stick butter

1 cup sugar

1/2 cup whiskey


Melt butter. Add sugar and whiskey. Cook until sugar is dissolved and of syrup texture. After removing the cake from the oven poke holes (with fork) in the top (leave cake in pan while doing this). Pour some of the syrup mixture over the cake. Let cake sit in pan 15-20 minutes. Remove cake from pan and brush remaining syrup on sides and on top of cake."
"TIFU by pranking a narcoleptic


Ok, TIFU I guess. Or 18 years ago I fucked up. 

Growing up we had a friend we called Bert. He was a big lanky and skinny dude, pale as a ghost due to his low blood pressure, prone to bouts of narcolepsy. Bert wasn't his real name, just a nickname that had stuck--it was short for Sherbet (pronounced Sher*bert* here), because he would foam at the mouth during his narcoleptic spells. In other words, he was a fantastic source of entertainment for our idiot troupe, and pranking Bert became part of our weekend routine.

He would drift to sleep during the slightest lull in action--sitting still more than ten minutes, basically. The only way he could stay awake was by keeping occupied, so he would walk around a lot, or keep himself busy eating (jerky was his favorite). When he slept he had two modes: he would either nod off and jerk back into consciousness a split second later (no good for pranking), or he would be out cold for maybe five minutes (perfect for pranking). You could tell he was out cold when he drooled.

One day we're playing Fifa '97 at another friend's house. I don't know if you remember Fifa '97 for the PS1 but the loading times were atrocious. After a while we looked over and Bert was slumped into himself, drool pooling in the folds of his coat (he rarely removed his big Manchester United manager's coat). We all agreed that Bert was due a pranking.

We knew we could move Bert around while he slept--an arm here, a leg there. But we'd never fully tested the limits of his tolerance. Two of us took an arm each and another guy took his legs and we lifted him from his chair. Sure enough he remained asleep. We swung him back and forth a bit and still he slumbered. We were amazed.

So *of course* we knew the thing to do would be to carry him upstairs to our friend's sister's bedroom. At first we just wanted him to wake up somewhere weird. Then *we* got weird. Our friend's sister was about four years older than us, something of a hottie, and she worked odd shifts at the local supermarket. We'll call her Jane for the purposes of this retelling, it's close enough. It was mid-evening and we didn't know when exactly Jane would be home, which lent a frisson of terror to the process of undressing Bert.

After we'd stripped him down to his underwear, we slipped him under Jane's big baby-pink quilt and took his clothes downstairs. This should have been enough for us, but the madness had taken us and we knew we were going to push it as far as we could. We took one of Jane's fragrant girly pillows and put a bra and a pair of panties on it, then slipped it under Bert's naked arm.

We skulked back downstairs stifling laughter, waiting for Bert to wake and flee from the room in terror. Five minutes passed, then ten. Usually he would be awake by then. Maybe the comfort of the bed had lulled him into a deeper sleep...

We went up to check on him, and found him in much the same position as we had left him, except now he had an obvious erection that had escaped from the front of his boxers and he had just had a very messy wet dream all over Jane's sheets and pillow. It had darkened an expanding area of the crotch of her panties.

One of the most grim experiences of my life was trying to mop up Bert's cum with a bundle of kitchen paper on the end of a pair of barbecue tongs. We tried to wake him but it was no good, and that awful pale thing of his refused to deflate. Apparently he had no blood pressure problems in *one specific area.* Then we hear keys in the front door and *holy shit Jane is home.*

I'm ashamed to say that I thundered down the stairs and ran out the back door and vaulted over the fence with an athleticism I never knew I had, closely followed by friend number 4, leaving our other friend to deal with Bert, his sister, the panties, and the cummy tongs.

That was a shitshow.

**Edit**: some folk are asking for what happened afterwards, so here's a summary: we ran for a bit then slipped home without passing his street. There was much nervous laughter. We didn't hear about our 'house ban' until two days later when we next saw our friend face to face. He explained that Bert woke in a fugue state just as Jane came upstairs...for a while he had no idea where he was, or why he was sticky, and he reacted to the pillow like it was a severed horse head. 

Jane naturally lost her mind at the state of her room and the cumstained slenderman flailing around in it and it apparently took about an hour to explain the sequence of events to her (my friend said it was all down to me and friend #4, a survival strategy I completely understood). Meanwhile Bert got dressed and got out of there, pleading complete ignorance. When my friend's mother came home, Jane spilled everything to her and Mrs X just blanket-banned us from the house forever. Luckily she was too tired and exasperated to call our parents because I'd still be locked in my room now.

Our friend had to clean everything up, naturally.

When we regrouped Bert was downtrodden and said we'd gone too far, but we soon got him laughing and back on form when we complimented the ridiculous volume of spackle he'd produced, joked that it wasn't the first stranger's load dumped on those sheets, etc etc etc. Juvenile stuff.

**tl;dr**: a narcoleptic friend; a dick that would not bend; a spill we tried to mend; a house ban without end

"TIFU By not stepping in dog shit


This happened a few weeks back and I'm still embarrassed by it. 

Now I must set the picture of where I live. A quiet rural area where many of the residents are the kind to own a Range Rover, tweed clothing and a dog. This area also has nice scenic walks near a canal. 

Every day i take the same route to work, it's a short 30 min walk along said canal and I pass by these jolly folk walking their dogs every morning. 

Sadly these people let their dogs create a mess and some don't clean it up. So on my way to work I was reading Reddit and paying no attention to the path. At a quick glance I noticed some dog shit I was about to step on. Without being aware of my surroundings I quickly moved to the right. Only to fall in the canal!!!

One dog walker saw me and came to the rescue. Pretty embarrassing as it was my neighbour. I had to go home and ended up late for work. Lucky my boss saw the funny side. 

I'm much more careful where I walk now. Probably would have been easier to step in the shit."
"TIFU by giving myself autism


A few years back, I was a naïve kid attending a smallish college outside of my home state. Utter shyness was my vice, and this made it nigh-on impossible to get a job in a town which was almost exclusively clerk/ cashier positions. Every interview I went to, I would cripple over into myself and sweat profusely. Still, I needed a job – badly. 

So, when I saw a ‘help needed’ sign in the general store’s window, I was eager to check it out. This place was old school; it looked as if it had been preserved from the social-contract times of the 1940s and the owner was an elderly man of eighty years. I ask after him and the old guy hobbles out, extending a hearty handshake. 

We walk off to a backroom and he begins to ask the usual questions, I begin to get uneasy and jumpy like usual. This seems to make the old man nervous also and a perplexed expression forms across his face as his brow furrows. “Say, why ya nervous all of a sudden?” the man asks. In a panic, the sweat funnelling down my neck, my hands becoming clammy, I was in a corner and this was the last chance saloon – “Er, well, you probably ought to know I have autism”

Fuck! A look of compassion and sympathy spreads over the old man, yet I want to run away. “None to worry, can you stack shelves for a couple of hours a day?” I continue to look at the ground, praying for it to swallow me whole, “yes, sir.”

And so, every day for four or five hours, I stock the store’s shelves whilst pretending to be autistic. I saw ‘Rain Man’ kind of once when I was on a flight, and I do my best to imitate Hoffman’s Raymond Babbit. If a customer came to me and asked for an item, I’d echo their words under my breath, or twitch my body around, or mumble incoherently. It was a shitty situation all round, but I needed the money and I was doing no harm. 

This ploy continued through to spring, until one day the old man asks me if I want to work front-shop ‘to build some confidence’. Reluctantly, I agree and continue doing a sub-par impression of an autistic man for the few customers that walk in. The old man stands beside me sorting out items, he seems proud.

A few hours pass and I slip into the routine. Suddenly, my mom and dad stroll through the door – I had forgotten they were coming up to visit me, oh shit! 

They walk up to the desk and hug me, I cannot react else the old man beside me will know the ruse is up. “How are you?” my mom asks with a big smile. “mrrr…” comes my reply. Mom looks confused, “mrr, mrr, work,” I repeat. 

“What the hell, are you fucking with us?” The old man steps forward and leans over the desk, he thinks a random couple have come in to abuse me. “This kid has autism, you fucking old whore, get the fuck out of my store.” My dad, my mom, and me stand with our mouths agape. Sensing I had to mitigate the situation, I throw my apron on the floor and run like Forrest Gump to my car, I floor it to my dorm.

Several hours later I get a call, it is my dad. “Son, have you ever been tested for the spectrum?” 

TL;DR: Recreated Rain Man with the old guy from Up"
"TIFU by farting in the shower with my SO.


Literally happened like 5 minutes ago. So the other day, my SO and I were browsing an ask Reddit thread about how to strengthen your relationship. We came across something about getting in the shower together, lathering up each other's butts and just rubbing booties together, ya know, really exciting stuff. So we waited until this weekend when I could be over at her place to test this out. After a long, hot day outside, we figured today would be our opportunity. We got into our birthday suits as fast as we could and hopped in the shower. Things were going good! We got all soapy, pressed our butts together, and shook like our lives depended on it. It was super fun. Here's where I fucked up; for some reason, I thought it would be a wonderful idea to just let out one of the burliest biker farts my body could produce. I built up my energy and just exploded flatulence. Of course we both thought it was hilarious and began to laugh... Until the smell hit her nose. She looked dead into my eyes, almost as if she were about to tell me the saddest news in the world, and threw up everywhere. All in the shower floor and on our feet was my girlfriend's vomit. Now here I am, cleaning the shower while my girlfriend feels ashamed and embarrassed over what just happened. FML

Edit: Wow! That blew up! Thank you guys so much. My girlfriend and I have a really silly and fun filled relationship and we've been together for almost a year. I love her so much. Thank you guys for the funny comments! 

Again, for those of you who didn't see, here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4y0kuj/couples_of_reddit_what_are_fun_things_you_should/d6k8x20

TL;DR- Farted in the shower with my SO

"TIFU by making myself look like a pedophile


Happened last year, not today. But anyway, me [22M] and my family (dad, step mum, two younger brothers 10 &amp; 5), we're on holiday. Nowhere special, we live in the UK and decided to holiday within the country as money was tight. We went to this resort, it's in the middle of the countryside, a big private fenced off piece of land. On the land is loads of these wooden lodges that people stay in, it's more of a quiet getaway. But on the resort there's a main building with a games center and entertainment such as disco nights and whatever. Really cheesy stuff but I wasn't bothered as my brothers loved it. Anyway, next to this main building there's a huge shop that sells souvenirs and all kinds of home accessories, it's only 1 floor but there's about 40 aisles. We go in there on the last day to buy some things to take back home, Mum &amp; Dad are leading the way, brothers closely behind. And I'm just holding back on my phone chatting to friends so I didn't die of boredom. Not really paying much attention to what's going on. Big mistake.

I glance up from my phone and I see mum and dad are now pretty far away. There's a short aisle that I can see over so If i went straight and then left I would've caught up with them. I assumed my brothers were with them but obviously they were too short to see. That's what I thought until I saw my youngest brother on his own looking at things on the shelf in front of me. I don't bother him, I decide to let him explore and do his thing while i hang back. A short while goes by and I figure it's time to catch up with the rest of the family. So I grab his hand and say ""Let's go!"" and start walking in the direction in which I last saw my family going. We're about half way up this long aisle when my brother starts making this crying noise. It was weird because it didn't sound like my brother at all. I looked down and staring up at me was this completely random kid crying, looking scared shitless, and wearing the exact same coat as my brother. I froze, not really knowing what to do or how the fuck I managed to mistake someone else's kid for my own brother. 

Before I could even react I heard a very loud, very intimidating ""Oi! what the fuck d'ya think you're doing!?"" I looked up, and at the end of the aisle is a ripped, bald, tattoo covered, white vest wearing bear of a man looking angrier than I've ever seen anyone in my entire life. That must be the dad I thought. Behind was a sobbing panic stricken woman who I assumed was the mother. I tried to think of how I would explain this to them both but before I could think of anything he started charging at me. This 6'5 built like a brick shit house daddy bear was fucking charging at me! Without any hesitation I did the only thing I could do, and ran. I ran for my fucking life. Straight out of the shop, straight out of the main plaza area, and right back to my lodge where I remained hiding until my dad called me. ""You alright? Where did you go?"" He said. ""Dunno what's happened but it's all kicking off in here, police are here and everything. Some sick cunt tried to snatch a kid"". I told him I started to feel unwell and decided to go home to have a lay down. ""Ok"" He said. ""Be careful"". 

To this day I haven't told any of them because I don't know how they'd react, and if the family of the boy are reading this, I really am sorry, I'm not a nonce, it was a genuine mistake.

TL;DR Accidentally stole a kid, got chased by dad of said, ran for my life back to my lodge while police we're called. (Without the kid of course)

Edit: Changed the TL;DR so it doesn't look like I took the kid to the lodge with me. A lot of confusion there. Apologies I'm not used to writing posts like this.

Woke up this morning and my inbox has blown up, I can't reply to everything so I'm going to answer a few questions here.

Yes, I shouldn't have ran. But it's not everyday you're in a situation like this, I panicked and mad a bad decision, which was to run. As I was back in the lodge I considered finding my family and explaining to them what had happened before going to the police, but the fact is I already ran, so that made things a lot worse. It was a fuck up within a fuck up so to speak.

No it wasn't centreparks, although that comment almost made me spit my tea all over my desk. It was in Hastings, but unfortunately I don't know the name of the place. A lot of woodland around, very secluded place. I'm hoping someone knows it and provides a name?

Yes I can see now that the title doesn't really match the story, but it's well over 3500 likes so I'm not gonna change it now.

I'm glad everyone got a laugh out of this, looking back it is pretty funny. I only wished I had handled things differently. I can honestly say I've never been so scared in my entire life. The man was the true definition of an English ""geezer"". I on the other hand am pretty weedy, but very fast and agile. I did what I'm best at, ran away from my problems. Pretty much a metaphor for my life.

Edit: Spelling."
"TIFU by dislocating my girlfriend’s knee while having sex [NSFW]


This happened a couple months back, but I was too traumatized to write about it on the day of.

I (about 160 lbs) was doing the deed with my girlfriend (about 100 lbs), nothing too unusual.
We were having a great time, both enjoying the intimacy of the moment.
I was on top, and I wanted to switch it up.

While I was still inside her, I tried to roll around to switch up our positions.
But then I heard it: a loud ‘pop’ from underneath my leg.

Her soft moans started to get louder, until they became screams.
I was confused, and didn’t know what was happening until I looked down and saw that her left leg was looking a bit unnatural.

She started hyperventilating, and in between her gasps, she screamed, “MY” *gasp* “LEG!!” *gasp* “KNEE” *gasp* “DISLOCATED!!” *gasp*.

She was going into shock, and if she didn’t breathe, things would get much worse soon.
I was panicking myself, but I tried my best to stay calm, and told her to breathe deeply and slowly. I started breathing with her, and eventually got her to start inhaling some air.

Then like a champ, she kicked her leg back, and with a loud CRACK, her left knee popped back into place.
That crack is a sound I will never forget...

She had to wear knee braces for the next couple months, since she used to feel pain in her knees whenever she climbed up or down the stairs.
Thankfully, she’s okay now and feels no discomfort in her daily activities, but has since developed a slight aversion to hills and stairs.

We laugh about it now, but back then, I felt terrible and was worried the damage would be permanent.

So gents, the few seconds you save from switching positions while still ‘connected’ to your partner is not worth the risk of dislocating your partner’s knee. Don’t be a dumbass like me, and make sure to switch positions when your bodyweight is NOT on your partner’s leg.

Oh, and we are still together.
We actually got married 3 months a go, and we are still going strong! :)

TL; DR - Tried to switch positions while still inside my girlfriend, dislocated her knee. Still got married.

EDIT: Actually, according to my wife u/gomteddy, the knee-incident apparently happened about a year a go. I guess the trauma makes it feels more recent than it actually is. 

EDIT2: According to a lot of comments here, she probably didn't dislocate her knee, but her kneecap. I don't know which, but I'm guessing it's her kneecap since she's not in rehab. 
When she got it checked, the doctor said her cartilage got bruised while the knee/kneecap was dislocated and cracked back into place. 

EDIT3: I don't remember because I was so traumatized by the dislocation, but according to my wife, we were back at it after she popped her knee/kneecap back in. So, I finished lol
And 'a couple' = 2 months. Also, 'ago' not 'a go'. Got it. "

"TIFU writing an essay


This actually happened when I was 8, but I was just reminded of it by another post on reddit. 

So there I was in history class and the teacher tells us to write an essay about a famous Viking. I chose 'Cnut the Great'. Despite producing what I considered to be some fine work, a spelling mistake was repeatedly made throughout, and I did not recieve my paper back after I handed it in. I remember the teacher treating me as though I knew what I'd done, and gave me a real verbal shit-kicking. I literally had no clue what the fuck was going on. It actually took me years to work out what had happened..."
"TIFU for stealing Yugioh cards from walmart and served 2 months in jail for it.


This happened last year, but decided to make my first fuck up post. This one is worth the share now that i look back on it.  Let me give a bit of background about myself before i share this story with you guys. Me and my buddy were homeless, and the way to pass time after we got off work, was to play with Pokemon and Yugioh cards in fast food places. 

I was working at Walmart at the time, and decided to steal three  big fucking boxes  of yugioh cards. The boxes was worth $25 each. After i got off work, i went to the card aisle, and casually looked left and right, and ripped the security tag sticker off of the boxes, and just walked out with it. I  at the time, was not under the influence of any drugs, so I did this stone cold sober.

I have no idea what was going through my  head when i  committed this heinous crime, but apparently I gave no fucks. So I get out the doors, and the alarm didn't go off, so I thought to myself ""Holy shit, I did it!"" I sprinted towards my buddy sitting in the car with excitement. 

I proceed to get in the passenger seat, shaking in amazement. I tell him ""dude lets go to mcdonalds and try these decks out"" Hes just as excited as I am. We leave Walmart, and head to Mcdonalds. We play 3 Games, before my girlfriend calls, and says ""I need you to bring my car back to my work, Im about to get off"" so We did. 

We pack up our new presents, and head to her work. We are sitting in the car, smoking weed, laughing, and playing Yugioh. Im 19 when this happened, and hes 27. A police car pulled up on us, and my friend went from ""dude im so happy and high "" to the most paranoid person on the planet in 0.2 seconds.  He cups the blunt in his hand to hide it, and i can tell its hurting him.  The cop gets out and walks to the window, and He says, ""Where were you guys earlier?"" I get struck with paranoia and fear.  My mind is racing to come up with an intelligent answer, because im sitting here with the fucking evidence all over my lap, on top of the middle console, and the dashboard. I could only come up with, ""uhm we...we just got back from mcdonalds playing a trading card game o...officer"" he replied with what i expected ""Where were you before that?"" 

Im sweating and nervous as fuck and scared all at the same time. I knew i was going to go to jail, because this would be my third offense petty larceny, and in my state, 3 petty larcenies get amended to a Grand larceny. Anyways, the officer and I are going back and forth about are whereabouts, and i couldn't take the immense pressure, so I said ""I was at Walmart and stole these cards sir"" He asked me to get out of the car and I did. Another officer was coming up and found the pot in the car, it was about a gram. He didnt charge me with that tho. My Girlfriend comes outside confused as fuck and starts crying ""what did you do!?"" the whole restaurant workers there knows me as well, and are right behind her. At this point, i'm so ashamed and embarrassed because they see that im getting put in handcuffs over some Yugioh cards. 

I get taken back to walmart in the Loss prevention room, and sign some papers, and got fired, and can never work for walmart again. As expected, I was charged with Grand Larceny. I go in front of the magistrate and to my surprise, got out on my own recognizance. Went to court plead guilty, and the felony was dropped to a petty larceny, and served 2 months in jail. No one in jail knew why i was there. I would not dare tell them the truth. So there ya go. Thats one of my biggest fucks up. If there are any errors, i apologize.  

TL;DR Stole yugioh cards, served 2 months in jail for it.  

Edit: Forgot to mention how the cop knew where we were and knew we stole. So Walmart watched me steal the cards, i think it was a secret shopper, if you dont know what that is, Walmart pays Loss Prevention employees, to walk around and pretend there shopping, but spying on customers to make sure there arent stealing. When i left, they went on the cameras, saw the license plate, called the police, then the police went to my girlfriends dads house, because the car was in his name. Her dad told the police where my girlfriend works and they showed up at her work to ask her if she knew where i was, little did he know, it was I, waiting for the cop, but no seriously, I was already at her work when they came.       


Edit: WOW! I didn't think this was would blow up. When I get off work today, I'll do an AMA. "
"TIFU by traumatizing my sister


Ok, so this didn't happen today, but my sister was talking about it recently and it reminded me.

When i was younger, probably around 11, I was really into Call of Duty (the good 'ol days). I had a friend as well that was into the game, and sometimes we would have sleep overs where we would play all night long. 

One night, my friend was over and we were planning on spending the whole night playing CoD. Except, come 11:00 pm, we couldn't find my disk for the game. Me and my friend began to freak out like the little kids we were and start to ponder where it could be.

Well, I had the genius idea that maybe my sister stole it and hid it in her room. She usually plays pranks on me so this seemed very logical at the time. Keep in mind she is 5 years older than me. 

So here comes the plan me and my friend conjure up to get my video game back: when my sister goes to bed, we will quietly sneak into her room and look for the game that she obviously hid from us. Seems pretty simple, right? What could possibly go wrong?

So my friend and I put our plans into action around 12:00 am. We head up my creaky stairs unhindered (the bedrooms of my house are on the upper level). We get to my sisters room, which is located directly next to my upstairs bathroom. Except her bedroom door is closed. Every door in my house squeaks when you try to open it. I tell my friend this and he suggests we hide in the bathroom and open the door inch by inch every 30 seconds so if she wakes up and hears the door opening she wouldn't see us. My friend is a genius so I obviously agree that this is a good idea. 

About 5 minutes go by and the door is now fully open. I had no idea if my sister is awake or not, but falsely assumed we were successful and proceed to lay on the ground and slowly crawl into my sisters room. My friend is also pretty ballsy so he goes in first pretty quickly. I hear a little bit of shuffling, but being as dark as it was in my sisters room, and only having the faint luminescent glow of a nightlight in the hallways outside of the room, I couldn't tell if the shuffling noise was from my sister waking up or my friend crawling in her room.

Its my turn now, and I am a little more timid than my friend, so I slowly get on the floor and slowly start crawling into her room. Very, very slowly. I really didn't want to make any noise. I hear a little more shuffling, and see the faint silhouette of my friend under my sisters bed. ""Perfect"" I think, ""he surely found it there!"" I am in the doorway of my sister's room at this point, probably cause I was too much of a pussy to go all the way into her room so quickly.

But then, something happens.

I here a quiet yet scared sounding ""who's there?"" It was my sister. Now, with it being as dark as it was, I couldn't see her, so I assumed she couldn't see me. But in the off chance she could, I curled up into a ball with my eye's looking into the dark abyss of my sisters room, not knowing how to get out of the current predicament I was in. My logic behind curling up into a ball was ""maybe if I curl up into a ball, she will think my silhouette is just a pile of clothes."" I was fairly confident with this idea, so I remained in my sisters doorway, not moving an inch, waiting till my sister writes me off as a pile of clothing and goes back to sleep.

Except thats not what happened. I start to hear a faint whimper, almost like someone was crying really softly. I remained where I was however, cause she had to go back to sleep at some point, right?

So a really, really long 30 minutes go by with me not moving and my friend under my sisters bed. At this point, I assumed my sister went back to sleep so I concluded that it was safe to move. I slowly, inch by inch, start to crawl out of my sisters doorway, not making a single sound. Then my friend starts to head towards my position as well. No game, oh well. I think its time we take the L and leave my sisters room.

Except right as my friend moves under my sisters bed, I hear a huge scream from inside the room, and then I hear my sister jumping out of bed and running. All of the sudden, my sister comes out of the darkness, I look up, she kicks me square in the face while Im on the ground, then leaps over me with as much airtime and distance as an olympic long jumper. She darts downstairs, whaling away waking up my whole house, and possibly neighborhood, and sprints out the door all while crying out ""THERE ARE MONSTERS IN MY ROOM!!!""

5 minutes later, there are police cars at my house (My sister called them). My parents were outside trying to calm her down. And me and my friend where in the bathroom trying to figure out where we went wrong completely ignorant of the situation outside my house. 

It was really hard trying to explain the reasoning to my parents, but I took the full blame for it because I didn't want my friend to be in trouble. But lets just say I never had a sleep over after that. And my sister ended up getting a therapist. 

Oh, and the CoD disk turned out to be under the couch in front of my tv. If my friend and I looked harder, this whole incident could have been avoided.


TLDR; 
Thought my sister stole my video game so  a friend and I snuck in her room at night to look for it but ended up scaring her half to death while taking a foot to the face and getting the cops called on me.


Edit: As hard as it is to believe my sister was screaming out ""monsters"" it is in fact a true story people. My sister has really bad fright and flight mechanisms so if she gets scared she has been known to do some irrational things in terror. "
