"TIFU by giving my girlfriends cat a chance to kill us.


Normally when I go to bed I put my girlfriends cat in the spare bedroom. It is always getting into crap it shouldn't so we like to make sure it can't break anything while we sleep. Last night he was being extra calm and sweet so my girlfriend convinced me to let him stay out as a ""treat"" for good behavior. I woke up in the middle of the night because I had a dream about peeing and we all know where that leads. But as soon as I woke up I smelt a horrible smell (to groggy at the time to realize what it was) and I was very short on breathe. Turns out he somehow turned the gas on the stove on and tried to kill us in our sleep."

"TIFU by claiming tea that wasn't mine, leading to a colleague taking offense and hundreds of pounds worth of damage to my workplace.


Me and my boss have a pretty great relationship. Lots of banter, elaborate practical jokes- it makes the working environment a much better place. Between us, that is. 

I'm the only one to have that kind of back-and-forth with him. All my colleagues (much older Polish men who generally don't speak English very well, save for one or two who act as translators) he's always brusque and professional. The Polish workers are the first at the factory and the last to leave, so he often writes hand-written instructions for the work they have to complete; as such, they're familiar with his handwriting, a fact which will become important later on.

This morning, whilst making myself and my colleague Piotr a cup of tea as he operated a machine, my boss comes into the canteen. Piotr brings in his own tea. It's some kind of special infusion citrus aroma thing, it smells nice, lots of pictures of flowers on the outside, pretty expensive stuff. My boss asks me whose tea it is. 

I could have told him it was Piotr's and that would have been the end of it. But, for reasons inexplicable even to myself, I found myself telling him it was mine. Perhaps I knew that he would crack a few jokes over it and wanted some early morning entertainment. Maybe my brain was still only half-awake and it was a genuine mistake. Whatever the cause, I found myself claiming ownership, and- as expected- received a barrage of well-meaning abuse. I chuckled, put the tea back and returned outside with a cup for myself and for Piotr.

What I will now tell you I have managed to piece together through talking to others, my own detective work, and some natural deduction. At lunchtime Piotr and two of his friends were crowded around the cupboard in the canteen, all talking animatedly. Piotr was shouting whilst his friends seemed to be trying to placate him. It seems that my boss, believing the tea to be mine, took it upon himself to tape the following label to the tin:

https://imgur.com/a/TQkCa

Now my boss telling me this was a simple expression meaning he thought it was ridiculous tea. Due to a cruel twist of fate, however, Piotr- the tea’s true owner- is a homosexual who it seems had left his last job due to cruel and constant taunting over his sexual orientation. He believed the expression ‘shove it up your arse’ to be targeted at his homosexuality. It seems he went on a rant in Polish, questioning which of his friends told our boss, asking how dare he put that on his tea, declaring that simply because he was gay did not mean that he took pleasure from throwing anything he could get his hands on up there. The more he shouted, the angrier he got, until he stormed from the building into his car to eat his lunch alone.

This is yet another cruel twist of fate, leading me to wonder whether all these coincidences really weren’t coincidences after all but some kind of cosmic joke beyond my understanding. Last night Piotr had bought himself a bottle of Krupnik, a Polish alcohol, on his way home from work and had forgotten to take it out of his car. As such it remained when he entered for his lunch, and in his anger and frustration he decided one drink couldn’t hurt and before he knew it the man was inebriated. My boss, out of the factory at lunchtime to buy himself fish and chips, was unaware of the events unfolding.

Immediately after lunch Piotr was needed on the forklift. This I wasn’t witness to, but it seems as soon as the vehicle lurched backwards some people guessed what had happened and ran to stop him; alas, it was too late. All I heard was a tremendous crash that echoed around the factory, and running out found that the forklift had careered into- and straight through- the factory doors. 

Piotr has walked out of the factory in a rage and hasn’t returned since. My boss, learning what had happened, is now looking for me, furious and in need of a scapegoat. I am currently hiding in the toilets and will remain here until the end of the day. 

Tl;dr I told my boss I owned some tea which wasn’t mine, he left a note telling me to shove it up my arse, a gay Polish man took it as discrimination, got drunk and crashed a forklift through the factory doors, completely destroying them.



UPDATE: With little left to do today anyway I have slunk out of the back door unnoticed and driven home. Some may call this cowardly: those people would be correct. There is another reason I didn't go talk to my boss and Piotr, though. When I left the toilets I could hear them having a screaming match along with one of Piotr's friends in the canteen. With my boss so angry and feeling guilty, he may well have fired me in front of the other workers; being a proud man, I think it would then be very unlikely for him to take me back. I'm leaving in 6 weeks anyway, but I need that next paycheck! Anyway, it'll be safer to talk in the morning.

Here's a picture of the ruined door since covered up by plasterboard. I've blacked out details of the company I work for.

http://imgur.com/a/8mF0a



FINAL UPDATE: Okay, so thankfully things seem to have gone swimmingly. Coming into work this morning my boss called me into his office. Instead of a tirade, I apologised for him and started to explain, and he cut me off with an apology of his own. It was literally like a 'I'm sorry' 'no I'M sorry!' type thing after which we both laughed and patted each other on the back. Turns out he came to an agreement with Piotr after figuring out what had happened- Piotr will stay, on the understanding that if there's one step out of line he's out, and he's not going to take my boss's note any further. The forklift accident will go down as simply an accident. He has since offended another person during the day, but as that is not my fuck up the story will remain untold. Thank you all for your kind support- I'll remember the advice when something like this inevitably happens again."
"TIFU by being to shy to tell the lunch guy I'm not Muslim


The lunch guy at my job thinks I'm Muslim.
It started off with a subtle ""do you want the Turkey sausage instead"". At this point I'm thinking ""well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage"".  Admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because I'm pretty brown looking, I have a beard, and Arab and Desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. Let's be real, he damn sure didn't think I was Jewish (*funny story: I'm jewish enough to legally immigrate to Israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). 
But I didn't speak up. 
Well today I went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course I pipe up and said ""oh it's fine I'll just eat around it"" which is somewhat true: I don't actually like bacon and I really did just want the pancakes. I must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). Well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if I took the plate just to make it easier for him because then I'd be being a *bad Muslim* just to convenience him. Well then. 
This was the first time that he outright called me Muslim.
Did I come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? No, in fact I'm at my desk wondering what I'm going to do for Ramadan.


Edit:     

1. Thanks for the gold.           

2. The cafeteria guy is a really nice guy, loud, jokes around with everyone in such a way that every morning is almost like a group conversation between me, him, and the rest of the line. It's a great way to start a morning- the guy is very personable. The flipside is that the times where I might privately correct the matter are few and far between.           

3. *That Seinfeld interpretation was absolutely legendary.*          

4. I really wish I would have spelt *too* correctly.           

5. To everyone calling me a p\*ssy, wimp, etc: whatever makes you feel tough I guess. I had quite a bit more to say on the matter but frankly it just wasn't worth the drama.

&gt;TL;DR    
TIFU up by being too shy to speak up and tell the cafeteria guy at my job that I wasn't Muslim, now I'm too deep in the lie, and have to roll with it until I have the courage and, more importantly, right setting to come clean. "
"TIFU by eating ice cream in the back of an ambulance


-- Obligatory ""this wasn't today"" --

I'm a firefighter/EMT and live in an area that responds to a significant amount of high-speed vehicle crashes. Needless to say, we all get a little calloused after a while.

It was July and my Captain, myself, and a co-worker decided to hit up a local fro-yo joint to cool off. As we receive our delicious cups of frozen creamy goodness, we get a call from dispatch of a high speed SCHOOL BUS VS. PICKUP wreck up on the highway. This is the kind of shit you dream/worry about as a FF. We hadn't even paid yet, but the kind lady thrusts our cups of ice cream into our hands and yells at us to run, and that it's on her. As we throw our protective shit on, the guys hand me their bowls (they are up front driving) and I am left figuring out how to preserve or discard the significant amount of ice cream present.

We're hauling ass, and I have the brilliant idea to put the ice cream into the refrigerator where we keep the IV drugs. We make it to the wreck, find out there is a school bus full of kids, and a completely unrecognizable truck that had a young lady (driver) who was killed on impact. The kids were alright, but all the bystanders were pretty shaken by the scene, especially because one of the lady's legs was amputated from the hip down and was just laying in the middle of the highway. I picked the leg up and covered it with a tarp.

Even worse, the car driving behind the pickup was the MOTHER of the deceased, and as expected she was absolutely hysterical. Basically, this whole thing was a shit show. I go over to try and comfort the mother, and listen to her say all of these things I know she would never tell even her closest friends, and then eventually left her when her pastor showed up.

I go back to the ambulance, and find out we need to move the ambulance to make room for some incoming units (43 kids inside the bus, all needed an examination), so I hop into the back and wait for my driver to get into the rig.

About five minutes goes by, and I figure he got held up. So I think ""damn, it's a hot fucking day and that ice cream is just sitting in that fridge."" Fuck it, and I go for my big bowl of fro-yo. So I'm sitting there, quickly spooning heaps of chocolaty goodness into my mouth, when the back of the ambulance door swings open. 

15 kids, 4 cops, my boss, and the poor frantic mother just staring at me, as I shovel a big lump of ice cream into my mouth. I immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. Bus full of potentially injured children. An amputated deceased victim. The victim's mother. And I am sitting in the back of the ambulance eating ice cream like a fat, careless fuck.

I tried to recover, practically throwing the ice cream sideways and stammering out ""alright kids who wants to go for a ride?!"" or some stupid shit like that. But they couldn't hide their disapproving astonishment.

So that's how I got the nickname Ice Cream.

TL;DR: Am firefighter, was getting ice cream, got interrupted, went to car wreck with dead people, finished ice cream in the back of the ambulance while on scene, was seen by everyone"
"TIFU and found out Jello can be explosive


I wanted to Surprise my husband with banana bread this morning. So I woke up at the butt crack of dawn to get started. I have four dogs; three under a year old. I got distracted when one of them ate a shoe. I cleaned up and added baking powder, not remembering that I had already done so before the shoe incident. 

I had the ingredients in the mixer. I beat the hell out of them. I scraped the mix into the pan and into the oven it went. And the banana bread started to rise. And rise. And rise... 

It frothed over the top and began spewing over the edges, all over the heating coils. 

After calming down and clearing away the smoke, I started to clean up and decided that jello would be a nice surprise, even though it's not banana bread. 

So, I put some water in a bow and microwaved it while I cleaned up. But cleanup took longer than expected, and I didn't want the water to get cold. So I added 30 seconds and went back to cleaning. And added 30 seconds and cleaned some more. Repeat five or six times over a ten-fifteen minute period.

I finally finished cleaning and added orange jello mix to the superheated water. It fizzled a little bit while stirred, but whatever. It was 6 am and my mind was fried already. 

I read the box and decided to mix in ice cubes to help it set quicker. Ice cubes in, jello explosion out.

I was covered in scalding orange jello juice and my kitchen needed another cleaning. I called my brother (who lives a few miles away), explained the situation, and told him to take my husband out for breakfast. 

Productive day. 

I'm going back to bed.

EDIT: I am new to the Reddit world and appreciate all of your feedback. It was brought to my attention that someone may consider giving me ""Reddit Gold"". If someone feels the urge to do so, please donate the money to your local no-kill shelter instead. They need your support more than I do.

I'm very glad that my unfortunate morning brought amusement to so many of you."
"TIFU by ruining my $1,600 laptop, which ended up costing me another $65,000, another year of my life, and will likely limit my future career prospects.


So of course this didn't happen to me today, but about 6 months ago. I was in the library studying for the hardest test of my first year of medical school. I had a cup of water that I was drinking, without a lid of course, and after a sip I tried to set it back down but it slipped out of my hand and spilled all over my laptop. I turned the laptop upside down and got napkins to try and soak up the water. My battery is not removable without taking off the bottom of the laptop so I just shut it off and hoped for the best. I left it off for a few hours to hopefully let all the water dry, but it had been fried. I was pissed because I had splurged on a MSI GT72 Dominator which was amazing and cost me way too much money. I spent all day taking it apart and trying to dry it out, but I'm pretty sure the motherboard had severe electric damage and so it was a complete day wasted.

I still had a test to study for, which was only a week away so I had to go to walmart and buy a cheap 11"" chromebook to hold me over until my replacement laptop came in the mail. My school has a testing service that we install on our laptops that allows us to be able to take the tests on them, so I installed it on my tiny new chromebook and thought that I was ready for this test.

Here comes the major fuck up, This test was 4 hours long, and I barely finished in time. After we submit our tests we are able to instantly review and are shown our right and wrong answers. I'm going through mine and it's looking okay, not getting everything right, but I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Then I get to a question that doesn't seem to have the right answer provided, and I think, wtf, and start looking more closely at the answer options. It's then that I see the answer options box has the ability to scroll down, and I see that there are 10 possible answers! We had never had 10 possible answers before on any exam and since my computers screen was so small I had only seen 5 and assumed they were all there. So I ended up getting half of those questions wrong because when I answered them, I didn't even see the right answer on my screen. 

I was freaking out and I emailed some people, but got no help and was basically told too bad. It takes about a week for our final scores calculated and released. I knew it was going to be close and when I finaly got them back, I saw that I'd failed by HALF OF 1 PERCENT! Well fuck.

I had to meet with a committee where they told me that because the class was so long, that I wouldn't be able to just retake the test during the summer, which is the normal protocal for someone who fails a class, but that I'd have to repeat the entire first year. So yeah, pretty shitty since this will go on my transcript and makes me less competitive when applying for residencies, so I can basically say goodbye to any of the ultra competitive specialties like Derm or plastics. Pretty cool.

tl;dr Spilled water all over my giant gaming laptop, had to take a test on my new small laptop, could only see half the answers to 10 of the questions and failed my test by half of a percent. Had to repeat the first year of medical school as a result.

Edit: There seems to be some confusion for some people. I am not in any way blaming the test, or my computer, or anyone other than myself for this. I realize that it is entirely my fault that I did not see that there were more answers available, and it was entirely my fault that I'd spilled water on my computer. What I'm saying is that all of this could have been avoided if I had a bigger screen, but I didn't because of MY screw up. If I'd just looked two inches to the right I also would have noticed that there was a scroll option fo the answers, hence, a second FU. I'm not a stupid person, it's just lots of things went wrong for me that week and it is a pretty big bummer that I screwed up so badly.

Edit 2: Since a lot of you are telling me I should have realized the ""right"" answer wasn't there, I'll explain how these 10 questions worked. First off there were only 10 questions that had more than 5 questions. These questions were ""which is the most correct"", type of question. I'll give an example. If I showed you a picture of an apple and said, what color is this apple?

A. Red

B. Green

C. Yellow

D. Mostly red, but there are green spots with most of the green concentrated around the stem.

And D was the description of the picture, then that is the right answer. However if you only had options ABC you would choose Red, because it was MOSTLY Red, even though there was some green included.

So for these 10 questions the right answer WAS always there, however, there was an answer that was ""more right"" available, it's just that I failed to see it."
"TIFU by grabbing the TV remote instead of my wallet


This happened a few months ago. I woke up in the morning and decided to go to the local petrol station to get a coffee from the Starbucks coffee machine there. So I just woke up, put some  random clothes on, grabbed my stuff and immediately and left the house.

I went the petrol station, served myself a latte from the automatically machine and took it to the cashier to pay. She said ""that will be £2.40"" I then went to get my wallet from my pocket and instead of taking out a wallet I took out my TV remote which I had picked up by mistake instead of the wallet. Then there was this moment where I just stared at the remote, then back to the cashier then again at the remote and back at the cashier while I was figuring out what was going on (I had only just woken up remember). 

Obviously I explained that I had left my wallet at home but I later realised that I never explained to the cashier why I had taken a TV remote out of my pocket ... It's possible the cashier thought I just wanted to show off my remote."
"TIFU by having an ugly face contest with my girlfriend.


This was about a week ago but I was at her house and we were just hanging out sitting on her bed when decided to see who could make the ugliest face. We were sort of doing a Blue Steel style reveal each time where we would make the face and then hit each other with it. It was one of the funniest things we had ever done but about 5 minutes of straight laughter in it was my turn again. I turned away and set my face with my jaw to the right and whipped my head around in the most ridiculous way I could think. My already strangely positioned jaw hit my left shoulder and my jaw became dislocated. My girlfriend just laughed hysterically for almost 30 seconds until I was able to control her and tell her I was in serious pain. We then had to go to the hospital and explain how the dumbest injury ever had occurred to a group of extremely skeptical nurses. It was not a good time.

tl;dr I tried to make a funny face and ended up dislocating my jaw"
"TIFU by giving my pug some milk


I fucked up real bad. This happened few days ago. Lets get straight to the story.

I was off from work and i had been spending it home alone with my pug. I was eating cookies and milk at the time and my pup Gunther sat right next to me as usually with the saddest eyes in the world. Cookies had some chocolate in them so I couldn't give him a bite but I decided to give him some milk. What's the worst thing that could happen, right?

I know my dog isn't lactose intolerant since he likes to steal food and some of it has been dairy and occasionally we've given him little bit plain yoghurt to help ease his diarrhea etc. and he's been more than fine. But if he drinks or eats too fast and swallows much air, he throws up a little.

Anyway, I pored a little bit milk into his bowl, pug came running all excited because you know, food. He chugged it down and returned to whatever he was doing. A minute later I heard weird noises and when I raised my head I saw a small puddle of milk-vomit he had thrown up. Ah, great. Went to the bathroom for some toilet paper to clean up the mess. 

I'm very sensitive to foul odors and textures, but since it was mainly just milk and saliva, it wasn't too bad. But once I started cleaning, the sliminess hit me and I gaged as usually. And again. And this time I actually threw up, right next to where my pug had thrown up. First reaction was 'well great, now I have two puddles of vomit to clean up'. Then the smell hit me and I immediately threw up into my mouth.

Feeling that there is more to come I ran towards the bathroom. I barely reached the bathroom door when the projectile vomiting started. It sprayed on the toilet, the tank, on the walls and floor, sink and the cabinet below it, mirror, washing machine etc. I got next to the toilet and tried to aim but since pretty much the whole god damn bathroom was covered in vomit, I didn't want to waddle inside it. It all happened so fast. 

While I was there, violently throwing up and crying I heard my dog in the other room had started to eat my vomit. I yelled to him to go to his nest which he did but it was far too late. He had walked in it, eaten some of it, his face was covered in vomit, his nest had some vomit on it. 

We're both good now. After emptying my stomach I cleaned up everything. Bathroom was easier as I pretty much just showered the whole room. But the whole apartment still smells like vomit, including me and Gunther. 



TL;DR Gave my pug some milk, made him throw up. That made me throw up. The smell of my vomit made me throw up even more until I was projectile vomiting. Vomit everywhere. Dog ate some of the vomit. 



 
 

EDIT: Holy shit, my most upvoted post is about me and my pug having puke-fest. That's great.

"TIFU BY nearly cauterized my butt hole shut.


I am currently in Spain doing some work for the US military. I am staying at a hotel and they have a bidet in the restroom. I decided to use it, because well, when in Rome. I sit down and crank on the water only to have lava come out instead! The water was set on the hottest setting and it felt like the devil came out of the faucet and knocked on my unsuspecting poop shoot. It's been about 8 hours now and my butt still hurts. Hoping a night of sleep will make it feel better.

Edit: well spank my burnt ass and call me Charlie! Never could have guessed my burnt b-hole would get me so much Internet points!

Edit 2: Woke up and things seem to be decent... I will be holding off on the coffee and smokes this morning to try and delay my morning poo as much as possible.

Edit: Also for those concerned, no bleeding just tender, overall not as bad as when I scorched my ball bag with Nair...

Last update. Thanks for all the support and interest in my butt, I did poop and while tender, there was no blood so I think I'm good to go. Time to go eat some Spanish food!!"
"TIFU by getting ants on my balls


Just gonna throw a quick didn't-happen-today-but-a-few-months-ago in here and here we go:

I was about 2 months into the relationship that I'm in now, my girlfriend and I were already very comfortable with each other, clothed or not, it was morning time and I needed a shower, so I did what any other person does and showered, I then go for the classic towel move ( I know, classic) and start wiping my body, and balls and que excruciating pain ON MY BALLS, STINGING EVERYWHERE ON MY BALLS. Then  I saw them, the little bastards, ants all over my balls at least 10 or 20 just crawling, burrowing, and biting into my precious sack. I burst into my bedroom where my girlfriend is lying in bed and proceed to yell/explain/cry that there are ants on my balls and I need her help removing them, she didn't even think twice, she just proceeded to, almost robotically, pinch every little bastard ant off.
They were on the towel somehow. 
Lets just say we're still together today.

"TIFU by being a bus hero and breaking a girls nose


So in true tifu fashion this didnt happen today but about a month ago. 
I was on the bus from school to home and at a bus stop a cute girl walked on the bus. So let me just explain that the bus drivers in my city are fucking horrible. Random speed ups and intense braking causes quite some casualties on the bus (casualties=people falling).
So ofc as the girl barely steps on the bus, the bus driver already initiated his fucking hyper engine and drove off at what felt like mach 3. 
So i knew what was going to happen because i've seen many people fall because of stuff like this. And ofcourse being the bus hero i jumped in to save her... But, i didnt really realize at what speed she was actually stumbling towards me and then as i held out my arms i didnt catch her. 
Instead she slammed face first in to my shoulder which broke her nose from the impact (mind that i had my back pack on and the straps are really tough), but ofc the fuck up doesnt stop there. 
As we slammed into eachother we both well backwards and i hit my head on the metal floor part of the bus. 

I blacked out instantly. 

I woke up in the ER and the nurse told me that i had a minor skull fracture and a concussion. Great. 
What made matters worse is that the girl whom i ""saved"" was lying on the second bed next to mine in the room with a bandage over her nose. 

I tried apoligizing but i just couldnt say anything, i was too amazed at my stupidity and i cant even immagine the reaction of the other people on the bus. 

TL; DR 
Tried being a bus hero by saving a girl from falling, ended up breaking her nose and got a fractured skull and concussion. 

EDIT(18.oct. 2016): WOW i never expected my fuck up to get such attention, thanks to all of you for the awesome comments... Even though most of the comments are saying its like a love story and i should talk to her and stuff. But since this is real life i dont even have the balls to approach her... And tbh i dont want to since it would be way too awkward. Thanks again guys and gals. "
"TIFU by putting the trash out whilst in my underwear….


(this happened earlier this year)

It was midweek, but one of my days off work, and I had been enjoying a lazy lie-in that morning.

10:00am
Like a creature from the walking dead, I groggily shuffle and stumble downstairs and invade the fridge. Downing a carton of juice, whilst staring gormlessly at the kitchen walls, I flappingly motion towards the bin with one hand… only to realise it is full.  

cue: *zombie groan*

Running on auto-pilot, I sluggishly go through the motions of emptying the bins and heaving the sticky bags to the front door, trying not to trip over my overly-affectionate two cats (a sudden affection likely inspired by their empty food bowls). 

[ I should mention at this point that I am still only wearing my bedtime attire, which, on this day, consists of an oversized t-shirt and some little knickers, besides which, I’m pretty much naked. ]

Quickly scanning the residential street through the door window, I come to the conclusion, that, on this quiet day, I should be safe to step out into my yard for the 4 seconds that it takes to put the trash in the wheelie bin (trash can); no one would notice me.

I boldly stride out of the door, and dump the trash in the bin…
...only to turn just in time to see the front door slam shut with a sudden gust of wind.

*Crap.*

I go to the door and try the handle, which, contrary to my sleepy intention, **locks it!**

*Fuck.*

I start banging on the door, in the hopes that one of my housemates will hear and let me in. That’s when I realise that two of them are at work today. 

The third, well, I’m not sure whether she’s in, but even if she is... she is as good as deaf to any alarms (she has the loudest most irritating alarm that I’ve ever encountered, which basically annoys the crap out of the other housemates and myself, and yet infuriatingly never wakes her. I put this down to her being a dedicated fan of loud heavy-metal music). There’s no chance of stirring her from her death-metal grave.

Anyway, I then think, “no worries, I’ll just phone her!” (or one of the housemates)… only I’m then met by curious and mildly-amused stare from one of the cats inside, who is observing me… and is sat next to my mobile phone.

I loudly slap the letter-box open and closed a few times and start yelling through the letter-box to any possible occupants in the house (not before hissing curses at the cats for their uselessness and lack of opposable thumbs).

Inside the house… nothing stirs. 

One of my cats starts nonchalantly licking her arse. 
I angrily give her the finger, before turning to assess my situation.

Like a startled shrew, I’m stood shivering in my front yard, with no trousers (pants) or bra, with hair that would make even Russel Brand blush, and my retreat path has been sealed. 

My housemates won’t return from work until the evening and I can’t call a lock-smith because I have no phone.

No keys, no phone, no money, no clothes, no dignity and nowhere to hide.

*Fuck.*

Remembering the spare key, I tip-toe sheepishly next door, like a sneaky cartoon figure, and rap on their door. ... No reply.

I’m wracking my brains at this point, and it occurs to me that perhaps I could access my back garden (and subsequently back door), through next-door’s garden, if they could only let me through their house. 
So I go and rap on my OTHER neighbours door. …To no reply. 

*FUCKSHITBOLLOCKS!*

I look to my bare feet, and then to the 8ft fence/gate to the side of next-door’s house (they are the end terrace)… I’m gunna have to scale it. 

Now, to my advantage, I’m actually quite good at climbing, so this shouldn’t be too hard for me... that said, I’m bare foot and the gate/fence is splintery as fuck, and not particularly sturdy. … aaaand I’m only in knickers under my big t-shirt, meaning any passers-by or neighbours happening to look out of their window, are going to get a pretty rosy view of my arse. Nice. 

I climb the 8ft fence without too much difficulty, but totter at the top, as I pivot over, trying my best to avoid splinters in my knickers. The flimsy thin gate makes the pivot somewhat challenging, and, for a moment, I feel like I’m going to fall, but I somehow manage it and drop down on the other side... and instantly slip on the green algae coating the concrete passageway. Ew.

I creep down the passageway and through into their back garden, faltering every second step to scrape orange splinters and algae off my feet. 

I peer into my neighbours back windows and shout a few cursory “Hello!”s to avoid being mistaken for an untoward intruder (all be it, a very scarcely dressed one).  … still no reply. This time I’m actually relieved.

It’s then that I am faced with the 5ft garden fence separating my neighbours garden and mine. It’s even more thin, flimsy and splintery than the gate,  and wobbles and creaks with a gentle shake. 

*Damn.* I’m gunna break it.

I choose the end of the fence that secures onto the wall of the house, in the hopes that, like with tree branches, the closer to the base, the safer and less likely of snapping. 

I try and make the move over as swift and ninja-like as possible... 

… and, obviously, fail; falling clumsily into my flowerbed on the other side, catching one foot and the fence and so landing in a painful Egyptian-esque pose with one foot up behind me. The fence cracks loudly, but, by some miracle, doesn’t break. 

*Phewf.*

Sporting an attractive mix of soil, algae, and yet more orange splinters, I hobble to the backdoor, close my eyes in prayer, and pull the handle.  

Locked.

Why, oh why, couldn’t one of my housemates (who are smokers and so frequent the garden), have lazily left it unlocked like they usually always do? I instantly start regretting the rant I gave them about doing this the other week.

I walk into the garden and look up at my bedroom, which sticks out the back of my house. Beneath my window, is the bathroom roof.  If I can only climb up onto the bathroom roof, I can walk up with roof and clamber in my bedroom window, which I often have slightly open to air my room. 

Nope, it’s closed. 

The bathroom window is one of those structures that looks like a rectangle divided in half, with a further division through the top third of the left half. That left top third is an open-able section... and it’s open!

If I can climb up and reach through, I can reach for the inside handle of the right half of the window (the big half), open it and climb through. *Perfect!*

The little window I’m aiming for, stands about 6ft above ground height, and so I drag over the garden table, climb up on it, lean against the window and reach my arm through. My arm isn’t long enough, so I awkwardly squeeze my head through the 30cm height gap and push my shoulder through to extend my arm’s reach. I grab the handle… and find it locked. *Damn.* 
(I never use that window and have no idea where the key for it is).  

My only chance is this little window, that I’m semi-jammed through. And it’s tiny.

Luckily, I'm pretty slim, and following various adventures, I’ve learnt that if I can fit my head through something (and can angle my shoulders through) I can fit the rest of me through. It just involves a lot of sucking in and wiggling. 

I reach my remaining arm in and pop my other shoulder through, and leverage my chest half-way through. This is where it gets tricky. Inside the bathroom window there is a 6ft drop into the bath, and nothing to hold onto/use as leverage. So I have to pull myself down the inside wall like something from 'The Grudge'. 

There is one point and I’m stuck, body dangling inside the window and arse and legs jammed outside the window, legs flailing... in only my knickers.

[Any unsuspecting neighbours who chanced to see this, must have been pissing themselves laughing]

Anyway, eventually I nose-dive into the bath, sending shampoo, soap, and a few odd bottles scattering everywhere. I’m crumpled in the bath, with soap in my eye, bruised ribs, and mud, algae and splinters on/in my feet, my t-shirt up around my shoulders and my knickers pulled half off my arse. 

I look up, feeling semi-triumphant and semi-concerned at having just discovered it’s possible to break into my house...

… only to be greeted by two pairs of big green eyes and an expectant “meow”.

*sigh*, the cats are hungry. 



&gt; **TL;DR.** Half-asleep me accidentally locked myself out of the house in my underwear and had to break into my own house.

"TIFU by letting my mom accidentally drink my own semen (kind of NSFW)


Excuses for my bad English, I'll do my best.

This happened a couple weeks ago. I had a pretty bad cold (not any fever or anything, just headaches and a sore throat and coughing up a lot of slime) so I stayed at home from school. I decided to lay on the couch while my mom was going somewhere with a friend of her. After a couple hours I was bored so I decided to start fapping (I didn't feel that bad). I didn't have anything near me to dump my load in except a cup with a little water left in it. I decided to use it and said to myself that I would wash the cup right after I would be finished. This is where the fuckup started

After I finished I was so stupid enough to put the cup back where it was. I know that I was being stupid but I really didn't feel like coming of the couch. Then my mom comes back and starts a conversation with me. She decides that she'll be nice to me and clear the little table next to the couch. She picked up the cup and DRANK WHAT WAS LEFT. You could see on her face that the stuff she drank wasn't exclusively water and she asked what it was. I'm completely fucking shocked and I'm just able to say that it was some slime that I coughed up and spitted out. She was extremely disgusted and got pissed at me. I just wanted to kill myself that moment but I think I handled the situation pretty well by telling her that she drank some of my spittle than some of my semen.
