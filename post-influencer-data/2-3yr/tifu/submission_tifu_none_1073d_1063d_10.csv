"TIFU by playing GTA V with my 3 year old


This was a few days ago.  My son was down for his nap. My wife works 3rd shift, so she was a asleep.   Figured I had an hour to play some Grand Theft Auto.  Soon after, my son woke up and wanted to watch me play the game.  I figured no harm for a few minutes, since I was just going to do races, or other non-violent things, with the sound off. 

Driving to wherever I was going, he yelled at me because I didn't stop for the red lights.  I indulged him for a little bit until I got to one of the delivery missions that are timed.  Didn't stop for the lights on that particular one.  He became visibly upset on the verge of tears.  I decided that it was probably best to stop playing.  That's when the meltdown happened.  It woke my wife up, so she's upset and can't go back to sleep.  So I dealt with a grouchy wife and an inconsolable 3 year old that kept pointing out my driving mistake.  Now my son notifies me of every light while we're actually driving and gives me directions on what to do.  Every. Single. One.  Yellow lights are the worst. 

TL;DR My son got upset because I didn't stop for the red lights in GTA V.  A meltdown ensued and woke up my 3rd shift wife while she was trying to sleep from working the night before. "
"Tifu by not calling out of work


Woke up with that feeling of ugh I don't wanna go to work. I'ma call in. Nah better not this is the short week I gotta go. So I got up and went to work against my will. 

I work as an assistant mechanic in an industrial setting and sometimes required to work on a 100 ton press. My line lead and I were working on said press clearing a material jam and were almost finished, when we both noticed some debris in the die (dye maybe idk). He used an air nozzle in an attempt to blow out the debris, he was unsuccessful as I could still see it. (Insert fuck up here) I reached my hand into the press to show him where the debris was. He never fires this thing without calling clear or fire in the hole. Well today he did. He pushed the buttons, it came down, my hand was still there. Initially there was no pain, more of a super wtf moment. Luckily when I yelled at him he released the buttons and it stopped before completing it's cycle and he was able to reverse the press. Got my hand out and just held it til I got to ER. Had to have my left ring finger removed. It sucks. But it could've been a whole lot worse, it could have been my entire hand. 


For those wanting to see my hand now. http://imgur.com/KVgL9ob (nsfl)  This happened Oct 2 2016

Update: for those of saying to lawyer up, I wasn't going to at first, but in light of other information I've received from the co worker involved I'm going to consult with one. As far as time lost, there isn't any. They left me on the clock that night and I was out for 2 days, which was covered by vacation time because of how wc laws work. I'll be returning to work Sunday. Under doctor orders of extreme light duty. 

Non dominant hand thankfully. 

Regarding the loto procedure it's considered impractical for what was being done for a couple reasons. Supervisions main concern is down time, mechanically speaking it's not possible to do a raw material change with the machine powered down and no air flow. Most of the supervision have never worked as a mechanic, so they default to downtime being the reason for impracticality. 

Talked to wc adjuster, everything will be covered including the 2 days I had to use PTO for. 

First day at therapy. Bandages off.

Doctor says everything thing is looking well considering its only been 5 days and that it's healing fine. Movement is good in other fingers as well for this point. 

Tl;dr went to work, did something dumb, trusted another human, lost finger.

"TIFU by blowing on my cat's butthole


This happened a few hours ago and I've been in a state of shock and disgust ever since. 

Okay, so I had just finished reading Harry Potter and the Cursed Child when my cat jumped onto my bed and greets me. So I start petting her and she climbs on me and starts purring and kneading me when she turns around and presents me with her anus, tail held high and proud. I had heard that this, in cat language, was like a handshake and meant she wanted me to sniff her butthole in greeting. Well, that wasn't going to happen and I had remembered reading on Reddit that if you lightly blow on your cat's bootyhole this could 'simulate' you sniffing it. So I did. Bad idea. She proceeded to spray liquid shit directly onto my face.

"TIFU By being a shady milk man


This happened earlier this morning.  

I work for a dairy distributer that supplies restaurants and grocery stores with milk, cream, etc.  We get to one of our first stops, a small coffee shop at 6:30 am and always walk in the back door, drop off their order, leave a receipt and bounce.  NOT TODAY!  It's cold as shit today so my partner and I are wearing hoodies over our uniforms, as we get to the door it's locked.  Frustrated we try to yank, bang on the door so they'll let us in for about 5 minutes or so.  About when we were gonna say fuck it, we turn around to two cop cars flying into the parking lot, they jump out start screaming at us to freeze, hands up etc.  they do a full felony stop on us because we were reported as burglars. Turns out the coffee shop had a new opener today, a 20 year old college girl who (rightfully so) mistook us for two burly, shady looking thugs trying to break in.  It took about 30 minutes and half dozen phone calls but it's all sorted out now. 

Our boss told us to come back ASAP where we were just given strikes for 1) not wearing appropriate uniform 2) violating professional protocol which doesn't include loudly banging on the retailers locked door.
It was also 'strongly recommended' we write an apology to the shop employee we frightened this morning.

TL:DR-tried to deliver milk to coffee shop, get mistaken for a burglar, cops point guns, slap on handcuffs, but quickly let us leave, formally written up by management.

EDIT: I'm surprised Reddit didn't get me strike 3, cause you fucks blew this post up!

Yes we had cold weather clothes provided, but it wasn't strictly enforced this time of year so we wore our own shit.  This sub is about how I/WE f'd up yesterday so I'm not looking to pass blame off on anyone, but appreciate how some of you were in our corner.  

P.s. Also, glad this post gave the guys with milkmen usernames their overdue chance to shine:)"
"TIFU by doing enemas with my girlfriend


Yesterday my girlfriend and I somehow decided that we both wanted to see what having a clean colon feels like. We went to Walmart to pick up an enema kit which thankfully looks like a hot water bottle. 

When we got home I decided she would go first. All goes well for her and she gets to the waiting stage. Apparently you have to hold in the water for 10-20 mins. 

Being an impatient person, I decided to start filling up as soon as she started waiting. All shit breaks loose for me at this point. The second I pulled out to tube after finishing the bag I immediately had to release the water. She raced me to the toilet because when I started scrambling after pulling out the nozzle she laughed which triggered her poop senses. She got 3/4 the way over the toilet and absolutely errupted. I was on the verge of crying because I knew I'd never make it to the upstairs washroom... As I'm looking at the sink she leans over and rips the shower door open. ""SHOWER!!"" I threw all of my shampoo and body wash out the door and turned my ass towards the corner and sprayed the water out like a skunk. A tiny turd flew out.. At this point were dying of laughter, embarrassment and disgust. 

TIFU and did a couples enema and ended up with fewer toilets than spraying assholes. 


This post was removed earlier this week because of rule 4.

---
Thanks everyone for laughing at this fuck up! To clarify, we were in the bathroom on the floor and had a 3 foot race to the toilet. She won but I got to shit in a shower so who really won. "
"TIFU by playfully setting a cardboard box on my toddler son's head.


This was actually last Friday, but it's had lasting effects.

My son (1.5 years) was exceptionally grumpy that evening. Everything I did was wrong or pissed him off or caused a giant meltdown. About an hour before bedtime, he was playing with a small cardboard box he's had for awhile. He kept handing it to me, and I was sick of him doing so, so I playfully set the box on his head. He immediately grabbed it, screamed ""NO!!!!"" and threw the box off his head, hitting my face. The corner of the box hit right below my eye, and it immediately swelled shut and turned blue/purple. I swear I was blind for a few minutes.

The next day we were scheduled to have family pictures. By then it had turned a lovely shade of dark purple and maroon. Thank goodness for photoshop.

Sunday was our anniversary, which it had then turned completely black, and I kept getting funny looks from every stranger I came in contact with. I constantly felt the need to explain that my black eye was from my son, not my husband. But isn't that horrible?

And tomorrow, I have to attend my husband's big fancy gala party for work, and this black eye has STILL not subsided. 

Good times. Toddlers are the best.

Edit: words.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the awesome replies, folks.. especially the makeup tips! But the amount of people telling me to beat my child for what he did is a little disturbing. He's one step up from a baby. He didn't throw the box at me to purposely hurt me. He just didn't want it on his head.

Edit 3: I'm a mom."
"TIFU by almost getting fired over mayonnaise


This actually did happen today, a few hours ago to be exact. I'm working my normal shift at Wendys (I'm still in school) anyway we're pretty busy and my manager ask me to fill the vanilla frosty machine with frosty mix. So I go into the walk in freezer and get a bag of vanilla frosty mix and pour it into the frosty machine. About 10 minutes later my manager looks pissed and calls me over to the frosty machine i look in and realize I filled it with mayonnaise. My manager starts screaming at me about how i almost broke the frosty machine and made me clean the mayo out with my bare hands and I despise mayo with my entire being 

Tl;dr thought I was filling a frosty machine with frosty mix turned out to be mayo and had to clean it out with my hands and almost got fired 

Edit: everyone saying I'm an idiot this was my first time filling the machine and I've been working here for like 2 months also the next day me and manager laughed about it "
"TIFU by buying my teacher a laser pointer.


So since the start of my CS class, my teacher had always complained about not having a laser pointer. Instead, she had to use a heavy-ish meter stick, because the board was about 8 ft off the ground. So I thought, hey, wouldn't it be nice of me to buy her a laser pointer. Boy was I wrong.

I went on amazon later that day and found a relatively well priced laser pointer and bought it. This think had all the works. A laser. Buttons for switching slides. A usb-wireless connector. You name it this thing had it. I was super excited to bring this in and give it to her. 

That next class, I decided that I would just leave a note and leave it on her desk, sort of as a anonymous present, just in the hopes that it would brighten her day and make her happy. I wrote the small note, then slyly moved to the front of the class and left it on her desk. As I sat back down in my seat, I noticed that the teacher from the last class and a few TA's had all gathered around the desk with a rather puzzled look on their face. I thought, ""No matter, they just must be surprised that someone left a gift."" Later though, when the teacher came in, she swiftly read the letter, then shuffled the note along with the laser pointer (it was in a box) into her bag. I was very confused why she hadn't just opened it there and then.

After a while, my friend Harley came and joined me in the seat aside to me in the lecture hall. I had told her that I thought it was rather strange, why had both teachers as well as other become flustered when seeing my gift. To which Harley said, ""Well what did the note say?"" I really thought about it, and then I finally told her what it said:

""Dr. Gibson - No more using that big stick :) It needs batteries"" 

That's when I figured it out. I sat there in silence. Harley facepalmed and tried to keep it together. I couldn't believe I was that stupid. Anyway it's been almost 3 weeks (6 class periods) and she still hasn't brought it up. Not sure if she just threw it away or didn't see it. I'm not sure if I should ask. What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Bought my teacher a laser pointer, she thought it was a dildo and threw it away.

Edit: I will be talking to her about it after class next Tuesday, I will let you know how it goes."
"Tifu by buying a colony of baplica dubia roaches online


So I have several reptiles and Dubai roaches are some of the best food I've researched. Unlike crickets and meal worms you don't have to powder or gut load them. They are big slow and won't infest you house. So I built an enclosure for my new colony I ordered and figured I could sell off part of my stock to reduce the numbers so they didn't over populate and kill themselves off. Today my new food source arrived so I opened the box and dumped them into their new home but instead of 100 dubia roaches. I got more like 2000 German cockroaches. Less than half went into the tank even less stayed in it while I fumbled with the lid. My wife now hates me I have an arsenal of raid and combat gel bait. Wish me luck.

Update: Roaches won the battle but not the war. They fried a lot of electronics hence my surprise when I seen all this karma. Called the exterminator $200 later they are kept at bay still see them at night only a few. I feel it's safe to bring my son home at least, thank you all for your support.

Update: seller is no longer a threat and has to give me money. He was an eBay scammer.he took internet pics and information made it look professional as hell. Then he gathered up roaches from his infestation and shipped them to me. He takes jars rubs the inside lip with. Petroleum jelly so they can't get back out. 

PS: to the neigh sayers give my your address I'll send you some free of charge. I have pics but can't figure out how to upload them.

"TIFU by accidentally taking a melatonin at 4am instead of an ibuprofen


I had to get up at 4am today for work and I am by no means a morning person. Quite the opposite. I woke up with a pounding headache and in a sleep deprived haze I took an extra strength melatonin instead of an ibuprofen. The bottles look quite similar and are right next to each other in the medicine cabinet.

Currently sitting at work trying to stay alive. "
"TIFU by tearing my girlfriend's cervix


So this quite unpleasant situation that happened last night.  No before you ask this isn't a story about how I have such a massive penis I somehow punctured by gf's cervix although admittedly it's not much better.

To begin you have to understand an important dynamic between my gf and I.  We're into bdsm.  Ok that was easy.  Her biggest kink is insertions, she loves being filled up huge.  So we're going through our scene, she's tied up to a chair mounted on a big ole buttplug while gagging on a dildo-gag.  I've got a nice little vibrator against her clit having a great time really.

Well then things take a turn.  We've experimented with using this [ pump dildo](http://imgur.com/dr1ZmCS) before, which was a lot of fun, and we've been longstanding [users of this guy too](http://imgur.com/2FpEiSe) (B not A).  For the first time we thought hey let's use them at the same time.  Start off and she's loving it, like she's really into it.  Screaming through the gag, spittle flying out the sides, etc.  She's losing it and losing it, so I pull out the gag so I can hear her.  I ask her if she wants to keep going and she just nods.  At this point I notice how fast she's breathing so I stop pumping her up and give her a minute to catch her breath.  I ask her a couple times and we have a quick conversation where she says she wants to finish the scene and she's loving it, and so on and on.  So I say ok and we go for the finish.

Well after about two pumps I see the blood.  **A lot of blood**.  I very calmly inform her we've got a bit of an issue and have to end the scene, while internally about to faint from the sight before me.  It's not the blood itself it's the fact the blood is coming out of her vagina like at torrent.  I quickly untie her, throw on a pair of panties and sweatpants and carry her to the car.  I drive straight to the hospital and about halfway there the endorphins run out and she starts complaining of pain.  I'm sweating fucking bullets (she's reassuring me she's not blaming me or mad or anything) thinking I literally just broke my gf. 

We get her in to the ER and they immediately put her down on her side, a bag of blood and some pain medication.  She's really hurting by this point and I'm trying to help and be supportive while dying rapidly on the inside.  If glares shot daggers I'd have been a pincushion from all the nurses who think idk I somehow beat my gf's cervix.  Doctors finally arrive, take a look and agree yep she tore her cervix.  Well I tore her cervix but she keeps saying it's not my fault, doesn't make me feel any less guilty.  They then of _course_ had to cauterize the tear.  My mind conjured images of a blowtorch going into my gf's vagina but I was assured it would be some sort of fast-acting gel that would still burn like a motherfucker but at least close the wound.  So they go ahead and give her a sedative and perform the operation while I sit out in the waiting room struggling to figure out what to tell her relatives.  

She was in a lot of pain when she got out, and was nauseous from the pain medicine to the point she couldn't walk.  And she was catheter'd because she obviously can't use those muscles.  So they kept her overnight and got released this morning.  Of course I have a huge meeting today I couldn't miss so I had to leave for work straight from the hospital, had a friend of ours bring me my work clothes and stay with my gf.  Guilt ate me alive so I came home from work, and have been pampering her all afternoon until she took another dosage of painkillers and passed out on the couch.  

What's the lesson kids?  *Know the limits of your gf's cooch before ya stick things in*.

**TL;DR: Playing real kinky with my gf and ended up tearing her cervix with a spiked dildo**

Edit: Alright I was unclear.  I threw panties _on her_ not me.  Jesus guys I can't keep making the ironic ""we're not into that weird shit"" joke over and over again.

edit2: oh you fucks just had to gild me didn't you.  I DON'T FEEL LIKE A WINNER REDDIT!

edit3: so she woke up, read these comments and laughed her butt off which I'm taking as a good sign for recovery.   We're headed off to bed now guys, see ya in the morning.

edit4: I hope y'all are happy.  You ~~double~~ quadrouple gilded a post about making a girl bleed out her vagina.  Never change reddit."
"TIFU by singing ""Rape Me"" in the gym at work.


It's 11:15 and about time I took my morning break.  I went to the gym we have in the office to ride on the bike for a bit.  There's a rule about the office gym, which is to leave it as you found it.  The lights were off and I didn't see anyone in there.  So, I left the lights off and got on the bike.  Once the workout was set up, I put on my music.  I hit 'Shuffle Play' on Spotify, and ""Rape Me"" by Nirvana came on.  
As I was getting into my workout, I started singing.  It got intense.  Rape me...  Rape me...  RAPE ME.

Turns out I wasn't the only one in the gym.  Also turns out that I have a date with HR tomorrow morning."
"TIFU eating free craigslist meat


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My house has three large dogs, and kibble gets expensive. I love perusing craigslist for free shit. It's hunting season right now and someone said they were getting rid of old, freezer burnt meat. I thought, sweet, dog food. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I pick it up, take it home, open it up and it all looks great. Give the dogs a couple pounds of elk burger and call it a day. What fucked us is this wasn't just burger meat, there were awesome antelope, elk, and deer steaks. We three are all suckers for steak so next thing you know we're cooking up steaks, and they're delicious. We might have been ok but we all prefer our steaks very rare.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I pooped water for five-six days, once every ten minutes or so. I've never been so sick in my life. My roommate found me in the shower crying and shitting because I couldn't go long enough to make it through the shower. The only plus to this experience was that I felt like I should have went to the doctor but didn't (no health insurance) BUT NOW I DO and the experience made me realize that accidents happen (sometimes in your pants)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This happened a few weeks ago but I didn't think of posting it until I read about the enema date. 

TL;DR Got craigslist meat, fed it to me and my dogs, got sick, shat liquid.

Edit: Someone asked the important question about how the dogs did. Dog kind again proved to be superior to the weak human being. All that time eating cow poop really paid off for their immune system. 
 
Edit: I added that I now have health insurance. 

Edit: I usually hate when people put up edits that their post blew up, but people seem very worried about a lot of things. Most importantly [the dogs are doing pretty fricking awesome since](http://imgur.com/a/qLQu4) (they weren't only living off of meat, it was supplemented with kibble) and while I appreciate you dog tips; I'm pretty sure that living on a farm and never being alone or in a crate is better than your dogs life of 8 hours a day in a crate eating premium kibble. 

Second, I said a few weeks but looking back on it it was a few months ago, I have not had any symptoms of anything since. I'm currently living a very happy healthy, craigslist meat-free lifestyle.

LASTLY. So is my home the only place where people commonly give away and accept craigslist meat? This is pretty SOP around hunting season to give away meat, accept it, and feed it to your dogs. Obviously I'm a big ol retard for eating it myself, but seeing the dog's health improvement of a meat/kibble diet, I would probably accept the meat again and just not personally consume any. "
