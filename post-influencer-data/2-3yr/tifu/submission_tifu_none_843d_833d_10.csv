"TIFU and punched a total stranger in the face


This literally happened about 15 minutes ago. I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.

TL;DR Tried to save a baby's balloon from flying away but ended up punching a stranger in the face."
"TIFU by climbing 999 steps with empty pockets.


Quick disclaimer: This was a year ago.

I'm a huge history nerd and I absolutely love exploring ancient sites. My mother and I took a trip to Greece and were on a tourbus.

One of our many stops were Nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said ""If you climb 999 steps, you'll find the beautiful fortress of Paladimi. The entire bus chuckled (Mainly middle aged, few elders.) But being the teenage self I am, I was determined to climb those steps.

There's a slight problem however, I was really out of shape.

I am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn't weigh me down. Left me with just my phone. She decided she didn't want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.

I begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. I had a sense of pride as I stepped to the entrance of the gate. I would be able to see a part of Greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn't able to see. I would have stories to tell at the dinner table. I would have amazing pictures.

Suddenly, right at the door I see a sign.

""8 Euros for admission"" 

and with that, I took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps. 

TL;DR

I left my wallet and climbed a mountain to see a historical site, only for there to be an admission fee.

"TIFU by befriending a lobster


So this isn't really today, but rather a summary of my last couple of lobster filled days and how I made a 150 mile journey to put a lobster in the sea.

So I'm a student and since coming to university I eat a lot of fish. Like 5/6 times a week. The only way to afford this is to prepare my food from scratch - including preparing my own fish  (£15 salmon can feed a man for two weeks) so I'm not squeamish - It also means I have a healthy working relationship with my local fishmonger. Every single trip, he will have some wild caught, exotic, fancy, or otherwise intriguing catch. There will be a little barter, I'll probably buy it.

**Wednesday**

This day is no different, I walk in looking for some coley (great alternative to cod, please try it, sustainable), when the fishmonger is like ""ah my friend! Only the best for you? I have the special stock out back"" 

Of course I want the special stock.

So he goes out back, and brings back this little fella, beautifully blue, with just one antenna, he puts it on the table. It wiggles that little antenna at me... And in that moment, I decided that the lobster in front of me was special. I say that I'll decide if I want it tomorrow. 

I go home... distressed? I don't know why - but in those small moments I emotionally connected with a fucking lobster. I go on a panicked 2 hour frenzy (this is the middle of exam season, I should be revising) looking for tanks, looking up lobster information, trying to work out how I will hide a lobster in my room. Eventually I realise that there is no way of keeping this lobster. I try to find friends and family with tanks that have no fish, or someone that want's a pet lobster - nothing. I decide to purchase it, and try to find it a home, and if not, quickly put it down with a knife (instead of boiling, which I am confident, having read the scientific literature, causes a lobster distress and pain).

**Thursday**

*I feel at this point I should inform you that my confused girlfriend now knows I am getting a pet lobster*


Now before I go to the fishmongers, I head to the supermarket. I need supplies to transport the lobster; and if I have to put it down, it will have a nice meal before it dies.
I purchase the following

1) Sea salt

2) Ice

3) Salmon, Cod, Prawns, Broccoli, Carrots (stuff that the internet said lobsters like)

4) Tea towels

5) Apple juice (to help me with the emotional stress I'm currently in)

I go to pick it up, the fishmonger (ex-chef) asks if I want it boiled, I say no, and that I will cook it myself. He gives me seaweed to keep him comfy and hydrated in. I take it home. Turns out the lobster is male. I name him Qui-Gon because there's always a bigger lobster. I take apart my plastic drawers, and pop him in one of them. Along with the sea weed and food. I play some underwater sounds I downloaded on my phone. I take pictures and post pictures of him on pet sites on facebook looking for a home and/or a tank - my third plan, was now to house him at my parent's home. 

*At this point my family knows I own a pet lobster*

Oh, I have a 24 hour bug and feel very very sick? Fantastic.

Wait? It's Thursday - I'm meant to be making the two hour journey back home today - I have to be back to go to Comic Con on Friday morning.

But this little guy needs a home. Being in a tank isn't good. He needs the ocean.

Anyways, me and Qui-Gon have a nice day. I work out a plan to get him to the sea. I'm too ill to make the 6 hour journey to Skegness. However, I can make an hour and a half journey to my hometown, and my friend has offered to drive me the other hour and a half to Southend the following evening.

I put him on the side, fill the box with ice, place the first teatowel over the ice, then put him back in the box with some food, then food and seaweed. Finally i put the second teatowel over the box to protect him from the sun. I've made up artificial saltwater to the correct concentrations to splash him with (not great, but should keep him hydrated).

Lots of train delays, tram delays, bus delays. Should be home at 8, I get back at 10.30. Me and Qui-Gon made a lot of friends - apparently you get attention when carrying a lobster on a 110 mile train journey. He's eaten some fish, seems happy. No signs of stress such as tail thrashing. 

I get him home and put the box back in the fridge. He seems a happy lobster. I check on him before bed. Happy lobster.

**Friday** 

I wake up at like 7. I check on Qui-Gon. He is responsive and seems okay, I splash him a little more. I head to London

Comic Con stuff - whilst filled with anxiety over his wellbeing.

I get back, my friend informs me that there is a fish center that can take him, about 30 miles away - and keep him in suitable conditions. I agree on the condition that he will be released in Cornwall (where he first came from).

Sadly, when I got home, he was unresponsive - after trying to get him to do stuff, gently brushing his eyes, unclipping his claws, etc. It's clear he is dead. I'm legitimately upset. A fully grown, 6ft, bearded man, may have cried over a lobster.

However, he did eat the salmon and cod, and displayed no signs that he had thrashed or tried to escape, or was other wise stressed. It seems that he died whilst numbed from the cold of the fridge, hopefully asleep.

I wrapped him in the seaweed so it would be like home, and went to the nearest lake, and eased him into the water. He didn't last long enough to get him proper help.

I literally spent Wednesday-Saturday with my life revolving around looking up information, caring for, seeking help for, and transporting, a lobster. I do not like animals, I do not want pets.

Qui-Gon was a special fella.

TLDR: Avid meat/fish eater. Emotionally bonded with a lobster in a fishmongers. Went on 120 mile (193km) journey in an attempt to return him to the sea. He died, now I am sad. However he had a nice couple of days eating fish and making friends.

"TIFU like, REALLY FU, by getting a drink of water


This post is purely out of a desire to take my mind off the pain.

Holy Jesus Lord.

So you know the drill.  Got out of bed in the middle of the night, gotta drain the little u/Trussed_Up, gotta wet my thirst.

I usually keep a glass beside my bed to drink from whenever I wake up.  Was carrying that back to my bed when **FUCKING WHAM**.  I slip like a bender's first time on ice.

First thing I think of was ""oh fucking shit, my favourite nightglass just smashed on the ground and now I'm covered in glass.

Second thought was ""OH FUCKING SHIT, THAT'S NOT WHERE MY KNEE IS SUPPOSED TO BE"".

I looked at my own leg in the dark of the 3:30 am Canadian morning.

My kneecap was completely backwards.  It was, to the letter of the goddamn word so I better not hear about it, **LITERALLY** BACKWARDS.

My kneecap was underneath my knee.

Now I ain't no pansy, so I took one look at it and threw up.

Then I lay there for probably 1 or 2 *minutes* contemplating how much I loved baby Jesus.

Since there was nothing for it, I did the most insane thing I've ever done, and in one motion, grabbed my own kneecap, straightened out my knee, and shoved that motherfucker back in place....

Except I missed apparently.  And it went over to the other side of my knee.  Cue baby Jesus again.

Now I've played enough hockey to know that sonofabitch needs to be in the right spot before you move.  So I grabbed it, praying like father Dennis would be proud, and put it back in place with both hands.

The first thing your mind goes to is this. https://youtu.be/-kcOpyM9cBg?t=440

The second thing is HOLY FUCK I HOPE THAT'S NOT GONNA AFFECT MY LIFE

Couldn't really move.  Called my clinic since I didn't want to jam up 911, and now I'm writing this to take my mind off it while I wait.

TLDR:  When you're 99% asleep and draining the dragon, use the 1% brainpower to WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING

**The post clinic EDIT:**  Well that was painful as fuck.  The waiting that is.  4 hours or so.  The knee hurt too, but oddly not nearly as much as you would expect.  As long as there's zero weight on it, it's really not the most painful injury I've had.  Any weight makes me want to yell though, so definitely keeping off it.

The doctor was surprised to find in the x-rays that I don't seem to have any bone damage.  He was *not surprised* to find I likely have fairly extensive muscle and tendon damage (hard to tell with the swelling).  I got a loose brace, a whack of painkiller/anti-inflamatory pills, crutches, a new ice-pack wrap thing, and a whole bunch of physio to go to.

All because chamberpots went out of style."
"TIFU by setting my anus ablaze with the fury of a thousand suns.


Obligatory this didn't happen today, it was actually a few weeks back. 

So I am a 17 year old boy, and like most 17 year old dudes I have moderate acne that I constantly have to deal with. Nothing crazy, but just enough to make me buy cheap anti-acne facial exfoliating pads. The things work, but due to whatever is in them they sting a little when applied and leave a very slight lingering burning sensation. I keep these on my special hygeine shelf in my room, right next to my toothbrush, toothpaste, hair gel, and deodorant.

Oh, and also my hemorrhoid pads.

Recently​ I gave myself a hemorrhoid by shitting too hard or however it is you get hemorrhoids, and it has been the worst experience of my life. You know how when you get bit by a mosquito you have an intense itch, and the more you scratch the worse it gets? Imagine that.

X 1000.
On your asshole.

So the only relief I have been able to find has been these pads that you apply to said area, as a reactive treatment to the itching. There is also a cream, that you are supposed to lather on a mini dildo-thing and insert into your butt. 

So, here's the FU. While doing desk work in my room, I casually reached to scratch said itch, not thinking twice. Well, as I said, it slowly got worse and worse until I was furiously tearing at my jeans. I have never itched that bad in my life. Suddenly remembering the pads, I sprung out of the chair and frantically unscrewed the lid and grabbed a handful of pads. I also took the little dildo thing, wanting full release from this hell that was my turd tunnel, and used the pad to continue scratching not only the outside, but INSIDE of my ass.

Normally there is a slight burning feeling, then the soothing effect takes hold and I continue on with my day.

This was not to be.

You see in my frantic scramble for relief, I had accidentally grabbed the  acne facial exfoliating pads. My anus felt like someone had poured molten copper in/around it. It is the most painful sensation I have ever experienced. I immediately fell to the ground, screaming in pain and doing my best to find relief to no avail.

Well, all of my screaming alerted my mother, and she burst into my room to find me lying naked on the ground with a mini black dildo in my asshole, screaming in pain.

TL;DR- I mixed up my exfoliating alcohol acne pads and my hemorrhoid pads, and used an acne pad on the interior of my asshole, which resulted in the most painful experience I have endured in my life.

Edit: Grammar"
"TIFU by mistaking bacon fat for Oreo cream


I work as a dishwasher at a small diner-type place. It's not the greatest job, but I stick around because everyone's friendly and I get free food. 

The cooks there like to be creative with the specials. On this particular day the special was Oreo pancakes, which were just pancakes with crushed up Oreos cooked in. Then, they spread on what looked to be Oreo cream over the top. I'm still not sure if it was the real deal or some homemade concoction, but either way, I wanted some. 

While I was washing dishes in the back kitchen, one of the chefs dropped off a bucket of kitchenware that needed to be washed. One of the items was an emptied container, caked to the sides was a thick white substance. With food on the mind, I immediately thought, ""Oh sweet! It's that Oreo cream!""

Without hesitation I took a big finger full and put it in my mouth. This was immediately followed by a full face cringe. As it mulled around in my mouth, I realized it was pure, uncooked, bacon fat. I spat out what I could and spent a good five minutes trying to wash the taste out of my mouth. Hours later I can still taste the bacon fat, and I still have not acquired that Oreo cream.

TL;DR: I had Oreo cream on the mind, and the second I saw a container filled with a white substance, I took a big finger full and ate it. It was bacon fat, and it was disgusting.

"TIFU by sticking my finger in the lawn mower while it was running


So I have two lawns, one scabby, lumpy old one behind the house, I and a new perfect lawn rolled out last summer in front of the house. The new lawn needed cutting several times a week to turn out nice, so the old lawn was forgotten. 

Well, today I finally went to cut the old one, where the grass was knee high. I finished up, but noticed grass wasn't spitting out anymore.

Yes, I was an idiot and used my finger to clear clogged grass from the side outlet with the blade at full speed. This isn't some little electric mower, but a 173cc 4stroke with a mulcher knife.

But you know what? I'm off to buy a lottery ticket, because all I got was a numb finger tip and a nail that was instantly blue in some places, guess it will fall off in a few days. But I'm just extremely lucky to even have a finger tip to grow a new nail on.

TL;DR: was an idiot, got away with it with just a blue nail and totally numb fingertip.

EDIT: The much requested pic - it aint much, but you can see some blueing of the nail(no that's not dirt, and no I haven't cut my nail since the incident because it hurts), and a small cut below the nail:

"TIFU by doing the worm at a school dance. NSFW


I'm not the most smooth man in the world. As with most FUs, this wasn't actually today. Rather, this was a few months ago. I debated on writing this the day of, but my shame overtook me and I decided I would wait until a better time.

That better time is now, apparently.

Does anyone remember March 25, 2017? Perhaps it isn't significant to any of you, but that was the day that I went to my Sadies Dance at school. I'm getting chills recounting this.

To fully understand the context of my FU, one must realize that I have never gone to a Sadies Dance. For anyone that doesn't know, Sadies Dances are events where a girl asks a guy to the dance; this is a twist on traditional gender roles in the United States. I actually went to this dance because a girl invited me to go with her and some friends. That was cool.

The other cool thing about this dance was that I went with this group in some Napoleon Dynamite-inspired clothes, where we had previously made matching shirts together in the style of ""Vote for Pedro.""

So imagine a lanky, 17 year old boy going to a dance with a group. The dance is casual, and everyone is having a good time. There are even dance circles forming, and people are showing off their break-dancing skills. Our group decides to make a mock circle, dicking around and pretending to do cool moves. 

This is where I get my idea, and completely FU. 

The beat is about to drop for this song, and there's a big buildup. The circle is actually considering imploding on itself, because nobody has gone to the center in nearly half a minute. I decide that I'm going to do the worm, and fall to the ground exactly as the beat drops.

I go out to the center of the circle. The beat is about to drop. I jump, and land exactly horizontally onto the ground as the drop happens. ~~Everything is going according to plan.~~

Until I land on my penis and pain just explodes throughout my body, radiating from my genitals. I could actually feel the pain pulse through me, and I got goosebumps from the intensity.

I'm no physics student, so I'm not entirely sure this happened. I was wearing jeans at the time, and my penis was positioned down as it normally was. My guess is that the jump I did to match the bass drop moved my penis up and into a U shape, and then the momentum carried that shape until I fell.

But it gets worse.

I'm on the ground. I need to do the worm. There's no way that I can simply just fall on the ground and not do anything. People are looking at me. They'd make fun of me if I just fell down. I can't let this happen. 

So I continue to do the worm, slamming my pelvis into the ground each time. I'm absolutely destroying my genitalia by doing this, but I know that I have to. After about five slams, I get up, laugh, and go to the circle with everyone else. I actually almost fall down on the way out, because I was starting to lose feeling in my legs.

I excuse myself from the group, give my friends a smile, and go to the bathroom to inspect the damage.

There's nobody in the stalls, so I'm able to rush in and evaluate the state of my dick.

There's red EVERYWHERE. Oh. My. God. I'm going to have to call my mom and tell her to pick me up, or ask my friends to take me to urgent care. holyshitthiscannotpossiblygetanyworsebecauseimightaswelljustcommitseppukuohmygod

Wait.

I inspect closer.

This isn't blood. This is just dye leaking from the red lettering of my ""Vote for Pedro"" shirt. I just have this massive bruise.

It's not terrible, but I'll probably not be dancing for the rest of this night. I go out. I see my friend, named Hailey. I smile at her. I sit down.

I don't think I've crossed my legs since then.

I'm not the most smooth man in the world.

TL;DR
I go to dance, land on my dick, think there's blood everywhere, just turns out my shirt leaked."
"TIFU by trying to be Tesla


In keeping with TIFU tradition this happened many years ago. We were a pair of young and passionate engineers. If you only care how this ended, skip down to the part where we departed engineering and entered the hallowed, and now carbon-scorch marked, ground of the TIFU. TIL: Tesla himself submitted a TIFU after melting the first AC generator in the country at Niagara Falls. He forgot the off switch.


The Plan


[HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program) is a government project and we wanted to see if we could do something similar with spare parts and a pickup truck -- instead of a bloated military expenditure run by professionals. We were going to try for a bit of mad science instead of the nice and polished kind a billion dollars buys. Point of note: There are no mad scientists, just mad engineers. They don't have control groups and tend to care more about making awesome as fuck things happen than petty contrivances like FCC radiated power standards.


The goal was to use some Tesla-inspired engineering and a junkyard of old electronics parts to make our own HAARP. Tesla's experiments are simple and every electronics enthusiast knows them by heart. They need: capacitors, coils, and a really big off switch.


The Capacitors


Capacitors usually come in micro or pico-farad sizes. We needed a *really* big cap -- so about, uhh, a few million times bigger. America! Go big, or go home. We built some big honkers out of metal drums and coated the inside with paint. We checked continuity and had to redo it a few times before we actually got that right. In went the guts that make a capacitor, and we're done with that.


We had to come back to this once the coils were done. At the end of the series we filled up some two liters with our secret capacitor sauce and would run some AC pulses through it into a multiwatt resistor block out of some industrial equipment. Math ensued, and we hit our tolerances. 


The Coils


We had to wind the coils ourselves too. We needed what was basically a voltage ladder, which would be a series of transformers at like 50:1 each time. It's not a problem for the first few in the series, but when you start getting *reeeeeeally* high voltages, even the tiniest crack in your wiring and everything's on fire. We had to use really thick wires because those come with really thick insulation that won't have any cracks in it. It got... big... and... heavy. And this is how we went from pickup truck to flatbed. Go big or go home!


The Off Switch


The most important part of any mad science... is making sure you can shut it off. Many an evil overlord have died shortly after screaming ""But -- *I am invincible*!"" *Off*. *Switch*. Ours was made of some pneumatics pulled from a dead caterpillar. It pushes forward, the connectors meet, and we have juice. When we're done, we hand-pump it the other way to release it. It's also safe because we're not near it and it's all plastics, rubber, and non-conductive oils. Out of a fear of having the pump fail from our nearby barely controlled chaos, we opted for the hand pump. Slow -- but it can't break. 


The Juice


We were going to power this off the mains. No, not house mains. Overhead mains. The big ones. Don't ask how we hooked it up. Think junkyard. Bored engineers. Imagine! Tesla's experiments needed a lot of juice. So does HAARP. And there was no legitimate way to get that much power except right from the source just like he did. 



How it *Should* have worked


We'd get some spectacular arcing in our mystery sauce substitute for the primary tap output. It would make the air ionize. That's what HAARP tries to do, except a mile in the air. Normally, Tesla coils are put in open air to let the arcing have a little fun and put on a light show. We needed that in a confined space so it was less the light show and more what the light show did that we needed: Ionization. We put it inside a tall pipe and sprayed the inside with non-conductive paint many times. We should also get some pretty good heating effect, so air would draw in from the bottom, pushing the ionized air out through the top. I think it put out something like 800 million volts by the math. For comparison, most people are sane enough to stop at around 500k to 3 million. If it were left in the open air... the arcing distance would be over 20 meters long. 


There was no video of this because, obviously, hooking into the HV mains is frowned upon. Most people do it for less savory reasons than the wholesome pursuit of science. Also, we didn't think anything more sophisticated than a vaccum tube would survive anywhere near our monstrosity. The intense RF radiation causes lightbulbs to glow -- even just from the transmission tower, which is just due to the current flow and not a deliberate engineering choice. Cell phones near it would probably never work again. But that was going to be all we'd have to worry about. The circuit was balanced. We had a off switch that could not fail. It wouldn't draw any more juice than the factory that had run here before. Nobody would notice.


Transportation


We thought it might be best to not be around when five hundred people called in asking why the lights flickered and then everything wireless went ape shit. A normal car has normal electronics, which might not work after if this was loaded in back on the flat bed. Remember what I said about big drums and big coils? That's... big heavy. So -- diesel engine. God bless something that can survive a nuke. We also needed to sure our vehicle was primitive enough to survive any mishaps and carry away the evidence with us. 


This was less a finely tuned chunk of RF engineering and more like a hundred ton coal-powered locomotive. But it'd put on a pretty light show. We would throw a couple thick plastic tarps and sheets all over the back of the truck, which should protect it. Electricity takes the shortest path to ground -- with all the metal covered and the vehicle propped up on rubber tires, it wouldn't be a problem. Airplanes get hit by lightning all the time and nothing happens. Our ride was sure to live.


The Location


We carefully selected a location where we could set up, and be near a transmission tower and a road. That took time, but we eventually found a parking lot behind a closed factory. A few cars were around, parked, but it was quiet and that was perfect. 


**Here's when TIFU enters the game**


We waited until it was late enough nobody was going to see a couple dumb kids pull up in a wheezing diesel with a tarp over something big in the back. A few minutes of setup and we do our (redacted) on the tower, and we're ready to throw the dead man switch. The hydraulic pistons edge slowly forward as we frobbed the foot lever. After a minute or so, a loud and deep buzz filled the air. 


The st. elmo's fire was spectacular. Just as we expected, the heating effect caused the air to ionize and in seconds we had a nice glow coming out of it. And by glow, I mean roar. Like back of a fighter jet roar. It actually reminded me of some experiments you see in high power physics or nuclear reactors. It was a sight to behold ripping out of the back of a flatbed. It started to heat up. A few sparks flew out of the coils, but given the juice pouring through it that was hardly a surprise. We weren't going to run it long.


Well everything went to hell pretty much as soon as we confirmed our little frankenstein did something cool. The two liters? We did the circuit perfectly. We overengineered everything else. Except those fucking bottles. We were tired and it'd been a month of fuckery building it. We fudged. Just run it a few minutes, see what happens, and then pack it in, right? The bottles didn't last that long. And when they went a minute in, it was to a loud boom and spray. 


Inside the circuit, there's a resonant frequency allows the best discharge of energy. Deviate much from that, and your whole circuit can become unstable. Rather than a smooth cycling flow, you'll start to get harmonics and stuff. Ordinarily, this just means you don't get a pretty lightshow anymore and your little Jr. Tesla Coil Science Kit just makes an underwhelming buzzing noise and lets out the magic smoke. The feedback eventually just karks it. We... did not have a Tesla Coil Science Kit Jr. -- ""For Safe, Clean Fun!"". No. We had the Tesla Coil Science Kit Sr., and it's motto was ""Let's Fuck Some Shit Up."" 


With that much energy floating around, that meant wild excursions in voltage and current. Gratz... we're now ground zero of exactly what happened to Tesla right before he melted the Niagara falls generators. The only difference is... this thing has an RF element. The smooth flow of ionized air started chiefing bad. It started shitting out lightning balls like an angry steam locomotive. Near a transmission tower. Which it was connected to. We... are not clever engineers anymore. We'd put it at least five times the distance of our expected arc distance between our apparatus and the tower -- so there was no way for it to ground out on it. That would have been very bad. 


Ionized air is... ionized. Ionized means it eats the paint off of shit. Literally. While we were trying to figure out if our new Chiefer Coil Deluxe(tm) was either an experimental success or a horrifying failure before shutting it off, Chiefer Coil decided to end the debate with huge fucking sparks in the everywheres. The drum wasn't insulated anymore. And our circuit wasn't stable anymore. This... was now causing lightning on a cloudless night that would have been visible for miles, along with orange and bluish shit floating around up there. It would have looked like an angry UFO saucer on a war path to the people on the freeway miles away.


We didn't know if there was enough left of the equipment to dampen any oscillations enough to keep the current from jumping to one of those ionized pockets that it was shitting out. Main line current will crispy critter you *instantly* With transformer isolation compromised the secondaries (output) could feed back into the primary (input). We were faced now with a daunting choice: Rush the hydraulics to release the connection, run and leave a very pissed off power company and half a million people behind, or begin praying at about 7 megaprayers per second. We made about 21 megaprayers while throwing paper-rock-scissors to see who'd rush the hydraulic disconnect.


It was a harrowing run to the primer to retract the hydraulics. I stomped on that like a Erdogan body guard on that thing, pulling the oil into the reservoir and kark it before it karked me. All around, lightning was grounding out to everything metal and the air was humming after our equipment dropped the bass. Well, again, our circuit execution was flawless. Our materials design was... less so. We retracted the hydraulics but a spark gap had formed. The mains didn't want to let go. Now we had an ape-shit tesla coil feeding back on itself next to something that was now sending a continuous arc ten feet straight up. It danced about in curling ribbons while pyrotechnics of blue and gold shot all around it. If one of those hit, the ionization path would send potentially a billion volts up to the tower and backfeed into the main grid. It'd be exactly like a lightning strike, only far, far worse. The noise of all of this had everything around us vibrating with a deafening and modulating hum. We thought we just needed to retract it a little more than the arc gap would be if the HV grounded out. Which is true: We didn't know it at the time but this is how power companies turn them off. 


We were fucking terrified for about ten seconds that it might not actually turn off. It did, just like it does for the power company, and the acrid smell of ozone was the only trace we left behind as we took our asthmatic (and borrowed) diesel, only the engine working and all the lights dead, and the smoking ruins of the equipment back out into the country before taking grinders to our equipment. Engineers: 0. Mother Nature: 1.

"TIFU by turning a strobe light on during a party.


**As told by Rivy**

It was October my junior year of college and per usual, my frat had a Halloween party that was hosted 
at my house.  Everyone was dressed up accordingly. There were goblins, vampires, slutty cats, slutty dogs, slutty sluts, characters from movies like Grease and Star Wars, one dude was a hobbit, another dude was the “Fuck her right in the pussy” guy from all those youtube videos.

I was dressed up as a medieval knight which came with the hood, fake chainmail, a sword, the whole nine. On my chest were the words “A Knight to Remember”. When people came up to me and asked,

“Hey Rivy, why are you a “knight to remember”?

I would immediately lift my gown to the side to reveal a three foot long plush penis accompanied with a saggy set of balls.

I waved the fucking thing around like a flag, chased my friends with it, shrieked when it got caught in a door and plopped in on the beer pong table to distract my opponents from hitting cups. It was a riot and everyone had a good laugh.

Later on in the night, many more people ended up coming through than predicted so I needed to get everything poppin’. The living room was the dance floor and the main area everyone hung out in so I had to think of something cool to get the juices flowing. In the back of the room, I saw that one of my big strobe lights was there but not on. I plugged it in, flipped the switch, and everyone cheered at the rapidly blinking lights as they flashed throughout the room. 

I danced for a few minutes before heading to the kitchen to grab another beer. During my travels, I saw my frat brother, Jafar (not his real name) sitting in a chair with perfect posture staring blankly into space. I asked him if he wanted a beer. No response.

“Are you alright, bud?” I said as I pat him on the shoulder.

No response.

I waved the plush penis around.

Still no response.

I looked over at my friends who are sitting across from me and they said he’s been like that for the last few minutes. 

All of sudden I heard the loudest scream I think I’ve ever heard in my life. It sounded like a man being held down by gang of demons as satan slowly inserts centipedes inside his urethra. 

I turned around to see Jafar on the floor shaking and screaming. The whole party stopped and turned to look at this kid wildly seizing. The music gets turned off, lights go on, and a bunch of us approach Jafar to try and help. 

Then it dawns on me.

Jafar is a photosensitive epileptic and my dumbass forgot and turned a strobe light on.  

We comforted him as best as we could and made sure he wouldn't injure himself or anyone near by. I noticed a small puddle of blood forming behind Jafar’s head so he must have hit it on the ground. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

Obviously, we called an ambulance and rapidly started cleaning up the house of any illegal substances just incase the cops were to come too. In five minutes what went from a house being riddled with beer cans, cups, trash, drugs, etc., turned into the cleanest it’s ever been. EVERY person in attendance helped clean and throw stuff away. 

The paramedics arrived and begin to address the situation. Jafar finally settled down, and talked to medics. He said he was fine but still had to go to the hospital. 

One paramedic asked what happened and me, still dressed in my costume with cock and balls dangling said “Yea, some asshole turned a strobe light on.”

In the end, Jafar was alright but needed some stitches and time off from class. The party got broken up early and everyone went home. Some people were pissed at me for not owning up to my mistake, but I was too nervous to admit to almost seriously hurting, maybe even killing, my friend. 

**TL;DR: Had a halloween party my junior year of college. Turned on a strobe light to make everything better. Forgot my friend was an epileptic and he seizes in the middle of the party. Paramedics come and take him to the hospital.** 


**Edit:** Wow, what an amazing turn out. I'm glad most of you enjoyed the story! I'm more appreciative, however, to the people that commented on the seriousness of epilepsy, in this case, photosensitive epilepsy. It just goes to show you how good times can shift downward in a matter of seconds.  

Just for those who are interested, here is an image of the costume I wore that night: http://imgur.com/a/brrpl

"TIFU by absentmindedly throwing my phone into the garbage and having to hitch hike outside a state prison. [Medium]


Early this morning, 1 A.M. ish, I boarded a Greyhound bus headed to Los Angeles. Along the way one of the stops is in Blythe, California. When the bus pulls into Blythe, I'm tired as fuck because I didn't get any sleep. But it's 6 A.M. and I'm hungry. Across the street is a Burger King. I buy some pancakes and a breakfast burrito, and then sit down a little ways away from the bus, on the curb, to eat my food. 

Clearly, I misjudged how much time I had because next thing I know I see the driver marching up the steps of the bus. In the rush to not get left behind, I throw whatever trash I had into a nearby bin, and stuffed my wallet/phone/headphones into my pocket, or so I thought.

20 minutes into the bus ride, I reach into my pocket for my phone, only to grab a handful of breakfast burrito wrapper. ffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkk. My phone is $300, and is housed in a wallet case (with all my ID, cards and cash). The bus ticket was $40. No brainer. I tell the driver to let me off the bus and he drops me off at the next exit. By the time we get there, I'm about 30 minutes from Blythe.

So I'm out there in the middle of nowhere, with all my bags, no phone or ID. The only way back is to hitch hike. Many many cars go by, a couple honk, none stop. Eventually, a big fat semi truck decides to pick me up. It's pretty beat up, looks kinda old, and has cardboard covering up the sun roof. I'm not sure, I think he was Eastern European, ~50ish guy.

Trucker: ""You need ride?""

Me: ""Yea, I need to get to Blythe, just down the road.""

Trucker: ""Okay, come on.""

Me: ""Thanks for stopping, a lot of people went by before you.""

Trucker: ""Well, you are next to prison. It is illegal to pick up hitch hikers here, but you don't look like the criminal type. I can tell.""

Me: ""What.""

He takes me back to Blythe, and he's honestly one of the friendliest men I've ever met. Sure enough, after a little digging, I found my phone in the garbage. I bought a new ticket to get to LA from Blythe, and I'm chilling at Burger King right now.

Thank you trucker guy! Saved me many miles of walking in the desert with heavy bags and no water!

tl;dr Threw my phone in the garbage. Had to go back and get it. Friendly trucker guy saved me excruciating walk in the desert."
"TIFU by blending my finger and getting peanuts in my bones


It was June, 2014 (not today--duh). My baby was asleep in his swing, all was right with the world, and UPS had just dropped off the immersion blender I'd been waiting for all week (a Cuisinart Smart Stick, for the curious). I was going to be mother of the year. I'd be whipping up organic smoothies and pureeing vegetables like a true goddess of wholesome things. First, though, I'd start with peanut butter. 

Before the thunder of the UPS engine was even off our street, I had that box ripped open and the blender plugged in. No instructions necessary, my friends. I was a pro. I filled a cup with peanuts, shoved that stick down in the middle and set to work. This was fun. SO FUN, you guys. I sang a little tune and did a merry booty-wiggle-chop-chop-chop dance while I buttered the hell right out of those peanuts. The transformation was happening! I was a master of domestic affairs.

Then it happened. Something was amiss. The blender was no longer making a ""ch ch ch wk wk wk vrrrrr"" noise. It had slowed to a pathetic ""lrrrrrrrrrrrrrg, lrrrrrrrrrrrg"" sound. Being the detective and goddess that I was, I decided this was most certainly abnormal and merited investigation.

I turned the blender over and put on my best Sherlock Holmes. I determined, wisely, that the peanuts must have become impacted in the blades, slowing them down. No problem, boss. I'll just sweep my (very important) left index finger in there and clear out the debris. You know. Help the little guy along. Don't worry, little fella. I won't let those peanuts hurt you. 

Now, for the uninitiated, an immersion blender has a convenient and large button that activates it. It's an ergonomic marvel. It sits smoothly in one hand, and all you have to do is just squeeze...a little...bit, and that sucker will chop and slice like lobsters in a scissor factory.

And so it happened. In a split second and with a trauma-inducing slap-thump sound, my right fingers betrayed my left. Peanut butter and blood shot to the ceiling. It splattered the window, the floor and the dog. As humans are wont to do, I decided that it was probably fine. Only a flesh wound. I'd just squeeze it really tight, not look at it, mutter a few ""ouch-shit-ouch-shits"" and hop around the kitchen for a minute. 

That did not cure me. I went to the sink to assess the damage and clean up, and my fingertip fell apart. It was like watching a wet red rose opening. It fell completely apart, and could no longer stand up to the forces of gravity. I wrapped that sucker up in a tea towel, checked my baby (who was at this point wondering what all the hollering was about), and set about planning my trip to the ER. 

Naturally, this is the one time I can't get in touch with my husband. I'll be damned if I was going to call an ambulance for a finger but I was losing a fair amount of blood and was worried that I'd pass out either wrestling my kid into a car seat or whilst in the middle of my drive of shame. About forty phone calls and 30 minutes later, I found a ride to the ER (where I also work, and had to explain my whole ordeal like the idiot I am). 

It was a true spectacle. Everyone came to see, and I have never subsequently lived it down. I was x-rayed, cleaned out and sutured by my horrified and amused peers. Peanuts had found their way into my bone (not many people can say that), and I'd earned myself weeks of antibiotics. How many weeks off work would you think you'd have to have for such an event? Seven, folks. Seven weeks of sick leave down the chute, all for being a moron.

So now, my finger is there. It's ugly, but goddamnit it's there. [Pics in various states of healing](http://imgur.com/a/DKvv1) for the interested with strong stomachs. 

TL;DR: Blended my finger, got peanut butter in my bones and was never the same."
"Tifu by cleaning my clothes washer debris filter


This happened late last night, not quite today. I was doing laundry and my washer kept stopping and throwing an error message. Pull out the book - 5E... not draining. 
Right, ok. Let's see...aha! clean out the trap. Oh, right! I know that's a thing! 

I crouch down and am greeted with a little door that says ""clean filter every two months"". Well fuck! I've had that washer for 2 years and never cleaned it once. Oops? 

I pry open the door, pull out the emergency drain tube and proceed to drain it. I fill a large bowl with the water but it's taking forever. The water seems to be slowing down so I figure it's pretty close to done. I'll just take out the filter now - there can't be much water left! And here's the FU. I unscrew the filter and am hit with a deluge of soapy water that is full of lint! I've never seen so much lint! And lint floating in water looks fucking disgusting! Grayish pulpy blobs that look like some sort of alien secretion. 

I try to shove the filter back in to stop flow of water but it was too late. I give up and water continues to pour out. And pour out. And pour out.  I run inside and grab all my (clean) towels to so I can try to keep the water somewhat contained. Thankfully my washer is in the garage so water damage isn't really an issue. 

Finally the water stops and I pull gobs and gobs of lint from the filter. I put everything back and everything works again. It was late. I decided to leave it to deal with later. 
I went out today and thought mold was growing on my floor. It's fucking [furry!](https://imgur.com/a/uVl2u)

I basically made paper with the lint and water combo. 


TL;DR
Unscrewed washer filter without fully draining it and now my garage floor is furry. 




**Edit**


FWIW the water didn't stink at all. I do leave the washer door completely open when not in use which seems to cut down on the mold/mildew issue. I also live in a dry climate so it actually dries out completely.

I will check the trap again later today - I washed the towels that I used to mop up the water and I assume I deposited a good chunk of lint right back into the washer in doing so.
