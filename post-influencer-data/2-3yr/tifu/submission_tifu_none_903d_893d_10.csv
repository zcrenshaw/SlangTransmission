"TIFU by going too hard while masturbating.


This was a few months ago, but I was just slapping the ol' beef and didn't really have a ton else to do. Came a few times, figured I could go for one more. At this point the dick was getting kinda flappy but I figured if I went hard enough it would work itself out. After a while of jerking, my arm started to get tired so I switched arms. Started again with renewed vigor and went basically as fast as I could, squeezing for more feeling. I started squeezing tighter and tighter as my arm got more tired and I kinda started to tense up everywhere, and suddenly I heard like a physical rip and felt excruciating pain from my Willy. Looked down to examine and there were broken blood vessels in a ring around the base of my dick. I then had to figure out how to get my pants back on and drive myself to the hospital without passing out. Ended up in a dick cast type thing for a few weeks, now I'm really horny but afraid to masturbate. 

TL,DR: tried finishing too many times, almost tore my dick off.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that unfortunately I don't have any pics cause I was too embarrassed of the situation. It wasn't exactly a dick cast like one on your arm necessarily, but more of just kind of a thing to hold it in place while it healed. Peeing was interesting. They gave me some medicine to help it not fill with blood every now and then (like if I was to randomly pop a boner) which sorta helped. This was the first time I told anyone about this cause I was pretty embarrassed. Nothing like confessing your idiocracy to Reddit!

"TIFU by waging chemical warfare on myself in my kitchen.


Okay, so, we all know ""don't mix ammonia and bleach"", right? And really, the worst that it ever gets for some people who accidentally do that is burning eyes and a painful breathing, because they mix cleaners, and not in very great quantities.

I'm working on a project and I needed to corrode various metals. Steel was obviously the easiest - just some vinegar and salt, let it soak for an hour, then air dry, then repeat until it's as corroded as I want it to be.

Well I needed to corrode *aluminum* which isn't nearly as simple - aluminum has an oxide layer that resists corrosion. So I needed something to strip the oxide layer. Somehow I came up with the decision to mix vinegar and *bleach*. Okay, so, what I *didn't* know is that even though the chemical reaction is completely different, *it still makes chloramine gas*.

Remember how I said most people are just doing basic cleaning and mixing low quantities? Well I had a lot of aluminum. I made nearly a fucking gallon of this stuff. The only thing that probably saved my life is that in order to keep pets and the odor of this noxious brew down, I sealed it inside a big plastic container and left it just outside my kitchen.

Fast forward to the next day. I look at the container and the mixture apparently worked how I wanted it to - the liquid inside was a dark, rusty red! Time to see the results, and see if it needed to soak for a few more days. I crack the lid off the container and... yeah.

Wow. I was not expecting what roiled out of this box. I had been exposed to CS in the military as part of CBRNE training. Deeply unpleasant stuff. But this was on a whole other level.

You cannot even get one breath. Your passages immediately slam shut and an impossible to stop cough racks your body. My eyes started burning. I immediatley thought 'gas gas gas!'. I knew my cat was standing nearby and would succumb to this long before I did, so I grabbed him and basically hurled him down the hallway into my room and locked him in there. Now I was in the back of the house and could breathe - I also knew enough from my training is that the chlorine burns your mucous membranes - if the cough didn't stop, that was bad news. I felt okay, but for how much  longer? There was a superfund chemical spill in my kitchen!

I suppose it's anti-climactic that this TIFU has a happy and mundane ending. A few month ago I found a website selling US surplus M17 gasmasks. [They looked pretty cool.](https://www.google.com/search?q=m17+gas+mask&amp;rlz=1C1ASUM_enUS522US731&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKosq36_jSAhVLQSYKHYi7A5sQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1094) I had spent ages cleaning up some awful residue that had coated it. It came with sealed filters (which have without a doubt had expired decades ago) that I had installed, and I sized it to fit. I even had the gas mask sitting out and ready to use.

I pulled the mask on, tested the seal, and walked back into the kitchen. Who'd have thought that after all the training, all the exercises, all the times I had lugged a fucking gas mask around with me through Korea and the Middle East, the one time I would *actually* need one was when I nearly killed myself in my own home. I had absolutely no idea if the filters were even any good... I had been holding my breath. I walked closer and finally took a breath. Then a second. The gas mask worked. It worked!

I knew I needed to get this shit out of my house, so I threw on some rubber gloves, picked up the vat and carried it out to the garage. After opening the garage door - there I was. Standing in nothing but my underwear, with a gas mask and elbow-length rubber gloves, carrying a vat of noxious materials. I was like a functionally retarded Walter fucking White. All I needed was my gun with me.

I had no idea what to do with the toxic mess so I dumped it all right there on my driveway. Still wearing the gas mask, I began spraying the entire area down with the hose until I felt it was sufficiently diluted. I then opened all the windows and let the house air out for the rest of the day. Kitty got lots of treats. I monitored us both for any persistent effects but I don't think he got any of it. 

And that was how I nearly fucking killed myself with chloramine. Acetic acid + sodium hypochlorite = bad shit.

On the plus side, the aluminum came out pretty good! I think next time I'll stick with a galvanic corrosion approach though, and wrap it in steel wool before immersing in a much safer salt bath.

TL;DR: I didn't know there were multiple reactions that would liberate the chlorine out of bleach, and acetic acid is one of them. After brewing an entire gallon of this lethal swill, the gas mask I purchased on a lark saved me more than the gas mask I was issued in the military *ever* did."

"TIFU by ripping off chunks of lip with a -195C spoon


happened 2 hours ago, sitting on the bus back home with gauze strapped to my mouth

so. I'm a pastry chef and my restaurant has  this one dessert where I siphon nitrous oxide charged cream into liquid nitrogen and break the frozen chunks up into something akin to dippin dots. pretty tasty stuff, and I usually have a little taste to make sure it tastes good before I send it out.

order comes in, we're pretty packed so I rush to get my shit together - I toast my meringue, add my granita and vanilla ice cream and get my stuff out for the nitro cream.

now, nitrogen is pretty fuckin cold and dangerous to handle - e s p e c i a l l y in a cramped open concept kitchen, with customers sitting right in front of you. you kinda have to put on a show and remember your kilometre long order docket while protecting customers from being splashed by -196C (or -321F for the only place that still uses the imperial system) liquid

cut to when I'm breaking the cream up in the nitrogen. it freezes to a crunchy solid on contact, and the nitrogen is basically a ruthless liquid that freezes anything and everything. my spoon is pretty frozen at this point, and I leave it in the nitrogen with some cream bits still on it. bout 30 seconds later after the dessert is out, I'm talking to my guests when I put the spoon (THE FROZEN SUPER FROZEN FUCKING SPOON) in my mouth to taste the cream

cue the fuckupery! the spoon immediately freezes to the corners of my lips and gets stuck. panicking, I turn away from the guests and start tugging, feeling a world of pain as little chunks of flesh start ripping out. I then had a brilliant idea to try and warm the spoon with the heat of my whole mouth, clamping down with the entirety of my lips, ultimately freezing my entire mouth shut. blood starts dripping from the side of my mouth, and I turn to see guests just staring at me with their jaws on the floor (how nice to be able to separate your lips, huh?)

I pull harder and feel flesh tear and new wounds open. tears are coming to my eyes and I give up and run to the bathroom, washing my mouth and the spoon with hot water. the spoon comes loose but so does all the skin that came off with it. I'm now pouring blood and my tastebuds have been rendered useless for the rest of the night.

I find my head chef and kind of just mumbled a bloody something about a first aid kit - patched myself up, and couldn't speak or taste for the rest of the night while continuing normal service with a wad of gauze taped to my mouth

TL;DR : decided to put a -195C spoon in my mouth and froze it, yanked a little too hard, bled everywhere and lost the number one tool any chef is nothing without

Edit: the parts of my mouth that were bleeding are now stark white, and my lower lip is swollen and the inside that touched the spoon is white, my tongue is a little numb but I think I have 60% of my sense of taste back. the white bits feel like ulcers, but I didn't see a doc, I don't think I need to unless it gets worse
never gonna put cold spoons in my mouth again

"TIFU by having some ""me time""


Posting this under an alt on the off-chance my actual account ever gets discovered because I sure as hell don't want anyone I know knowing about this story. I'm currently curled up under a blanket in my room sobering up and wondering if I will ever feel truly clean again. Be prepared, though, because this is going to be a bit of a long one. And yes, it actually happened today.

Earlier this afternoon I partook in some (legal) consumption of the devil's lettuce (don't do drugs kids) and was, needless to say, not in a well-adjusted state of mind. After my little escapade outside, I decided to come inside and fix myself a little snack. Found some ice cream in the freezer, bam, favorite snack of all time sober or high. Ate the fuck out of the ice cream, as well as a grilled cheese sandwich. Content with myself, I went up to my bedroom to watch some youtube and maybe take a nap. 

I laid around in my bed for a bit when the sudden thought came to my mind: I was home alone, just a little bit stoned, and it was the perfect time for a little self-love session. I grabbed my trusty little ""back massager"" and a pair of headphones (just in case), and for whatever reason, I decided to do it in the bathroom. Call it the alluring ambiance of the linoleum floor and cracked shower door or whatever, but I will forever be grateful for that last minute decision for reasons that will become abundantly clear shortly. 

Without going into too graphic detail, I got down to it and things were going swimmingly. Feeling great. I could ignore the gurgle in my tummy that surfaced a few minutes into the game. Because, much like that gay guy/gal you had the hots for junior year, I cannot make ice cream love me back. Still, the feeling wasn't anything I couldn't handle-- 

until it was. 

Just as things reached that final crescendo, I promptly shat all over the bathroom floor. 

To make matters worse, it must've triggered some reflex because my bladder decided to open the flood gates a few seconds later. I sat there for a solid minute in disbelief, unable to process what had just happened. And then I stood, utterly ashamed, and cleaned up the mess off the floor. That was relatively easy, but I still felt disgusted with myself. 

I decided my best bet to clean up was to squat in the shower and use the hand-held hose to clean up the downstairs. Which I did, except when I went to adjust my stance, I slipped on a wayward poo particle and went toppling over to one side. I landed hard on my elbow, which mostly snapped me out of whatever was left of my high. I cried out in pain as I reached for the faucet to turn off the water. Instead of pressing it down, though, I twisted it to the ""HOT"" side and was promptly met with a blisteringly hot stream of water to my nether region. That hurt INFINITELY worse than the fall on my elbow. Ever simultaneously scald your ass and genitals? No? Good. Don't. 

I finally managed to put off the water and climb out of the bathtub. For the next twenty minute I lay in the fetal position on the bath mat, cold washcloth between my legs, trying not to cry. 

Then my mom got home. 

I didn't mention this earlier, but I'm a young adult currently home on break from college out of state. I'm in this weird state of being where I'm not really a guest, but also not really a member of the household proper anymore. But when you hear your mother scream your full name at the top of your lungs from downstairs like she did when you were a little girl, you better bet your ass comes running. And I did. 

The bathroom downstairs-- which lies conveniently below my bathroom upstairs-- had flooded completely. And oh, shit, I had forgotten that the pipes to the shower upstairs had been damaged, meaning that if you tried to use the upstairs shower it would seep through the ceiling to the downstairs bathroom in the form of dirty, ceiling-y water. I was met with a mop and 4'10"" of angry mother. Instead of putting on proper rain boots before mopping, I decided to march into the swamp with bare feet. 

What you don't really consider when walking in water is that it really isn't slippery until it's mostly gone. So I got the majority of the water mopped up, leaving only a thin film of moisture on the floor. It was only then that I slipped and fell, landing hard and getting the wind knocked out of me and covered in nasty gritty floor debris. Two severely bruised kneecaps and a possibly sprained wrist later-- not to mention the elbow from earlier-- and my terrible afternoon finally came to a close. 

tl;dr jilled off while high, pooped/pissed myself, fell during the cleanup, banged up my elbow and scalded my ass/lady parts, flooded the downstairs bathroom, pissed off a leprechaun, injured myself further."
"TIFU by being a douchebag to an asshole.


So this actually just happened a couple hours ago. Had a buddy go with me to pick up a junk track car that has a very well built engine. I buy the car and as we are driving down the road my buddy's truck blows 2 tires, fuck us right? So with no other option we grab the track car. (Before you jump down by throat, yes it is a legal to car to drive on the street, it is still registered and insured. Legal just not practical; race suspension, race tires, etc).  Look up the local tire shop and head down the road. *This is where the fuck up starts.* My buddy sees a big red flip switch, and decides to flip it. The car takes off like a rocket with machine gun fire shooting out the exhaust. Turns out this thing has an anti-lag system ( for those reading this clueless, this if anti lag 
 https://youtu.be/XBvHxfmeYjQ ) We start laughing and acting like fools on this back road, just tearing up the streets. Once we get into town, we are on our best behavior. Until this blacked out Tahoe starts tailgating me hard, I move so he can pass but he just sticks to me like a stage 5 clinger. It's not just following close, it's getting dangerous. He is easily a foot or two from me the whole time. I decide, fuck em. I'll teach you not to tail gate. At the next stop light I flip the switch, and start reving the shit out of the car. Unknowingly, this not only produces a machine gun like sound but it make such an intense fire ball the Tahoe's bumper begins to melt and catch fire. Thinking I showed this guy, I fail to see a very large man pull me out of my driver's window at gun point. When I finally realize wats going on, another man is cuffing me as my buddy is face down in the street with hands behind his head. Turns out, the Tahoe was an undercover cop car, they thought they could bait me into speeding off, (which is illegal in my city). As more cops roll up, we are separated and taken in. After a long wait and a bunch of questions, I have to pay to get my car out of impound and will have to wait to see if I have to pay to fix the SUV. 
TL;DR drove a street legal race car and used it's anti-lag to melt the front end of a narc car, got arrested.

Edit/Update*:
So thanks for all love and comments everyone. I was contacted the police chief. No charges will be pressed against me, I am being refunded the impound fees. The officer has been suspended pending investigation of his action. There was a dash cam with sound, it recorded him explaining to his rookie partner how he normally does this to cars to help his citation quota. I will also be receiving a formal apology from the Commissioner within the week. I'm really thankful the police chief was quick to admit it was his men's fault.
I think it helps that our car community has such strong bonds with the police and i doubt she didn't want ruin what has been built.

For those wanting pics of the cars will have to wait, i crushed the screen of my phone while leaning over the fender of the car trying to pull the motor.
the junk car is a drift built 240sx with a 2JZGTE turbo out of a Supra. Its going into a a 2013 FRS chassis."
"TIFU by letting my dog in my bathroom, losing a chunk of my arm, getting my roommate stitches and flooding my house


Obligatory 'this happened a few months ago' - some backstory you need to know beforehand is that a) my downstairs toilet has an issue with its seal so it regularly clogs and overflows, b) I used to foster rescue dogs regularly and c) I'm not an excessively private person, at least not with my pets.

So, fast-forward to a few months ago. I'd just begun fostering a new rescue dog, which I'd had for a few weeks at the time. I live at home with a roommate, and she also loves dogs and is more than happy that I did this because she got to meet a new dog every few weeks. Though these rescues usually had pre-existing problems (hence why they'd been given up) I'd never had a problem with them.

The problem started when one day, the Chow that I'd had for about a week - whose pre-existing problem was that it had been abused and was very skittish - was home alone with me while my roommate was at work. It started off very normally; I got out of bed, had my breakfast, fed him, took him for a walk. I'd been having some...'digestive' issues so I took a laxative. And then I went to the bathroom.

This dog had abandonment issues to the point where it'd whine and whimper if it was out of your sight, and I'm not a private person, so I allowed the door to stay open and let him poke his head into the bathroom while I dropped the kids off at the pool. He licked my hand and sniffed around. No problem. 

Now, just as I was about to flush my devil's donuts, my roommate got home. In a hurried effort to maintain my privacy, with my hand on the toilet flusher and a dog halfway through the doorframe, I struggled to reach over with my free hand and both push the dog back out of the door and close it. He did not take kindly to this.

I guess the sheer shock of the noise of the flushing toilet, me hopping up from the toilet, my roommate coming in and closing the front door, and me shoving him back out of the doorframe must have been too much for him, because he went into full-on instinctive attack mode, latching himself onto my arm.

At this point, with my pants still around my ankles, I pissed myself a little bit from having a large dog latch his teeth onto my forearm. He began to shake and dig himself in further as I slumped down against the sink in a mixture of my own excrement and urine as I saw the toilet overflowing past the rim, and all I could do was scream the most blood-curdling scream from both the pain and the disgust.

My roommate quickly realized what was going on, and after the screams of ""get it off of me!"" ran into the bathroom to see me lying in a mess, the bathroom now full of water and bodily discharge with a 150 pound dog tearing flesh out of my forearm. As she pulled him away, he latched onto her hand and leg until we managed to get him out of the doorframe and lock ourselves inside the horror scene that was now our bathroom, bleeding profusely and sopping wet, looking at each other with shock.

For the next eight hours, after we rushed to Emergency for our wounds, our bathroom mess kept seeping through the floor, completely ruining the downstairs (carpet). The front hallway and the room itself were a mix of traipsed-in shit, toilet water, urine and blood smeared across the floor, the walls, and every other surface. 

Anyway, we took our socks off, wrapped them around our wounds, exited through the back door giving the now guilty-looking dog a wide berth and headed to hospital leaving our mess as it was, though we did manage to stop the toilet running any more than it already had. Eight stitches for me, and four stitches for her later, we came home to about twelve hours of thorough cleaning. The house will never be the same, and we immediately put in for the rescue dog to be re-housed.

tl;dr: Let a skittish rescue dog invade my bathroom while taking a shit, roommate got home in the middle of my bathroom time, scared the dog with the combined door-opening, flushing and hurried attempt to close door, ended up flooding bathroom and losing a chunk of my arm to a dog bite.

EDIT: Picture of the arm wound (**gore warning**): http://image.prntscr.com/image/99f83361915548d0ada730b130613eb7.png

EDIT 2: Doggo is now re-housed with a very good family (no kids) and has been since the day this happened, months ago. He's very happy and there's been no further incidents, and I've been told he's almost completely rehabilitated from his trauma as a puppy. Glad we didn't have him put down."
"TIFU by kicking the sofa


So I woke up in the early freaking morning and was drowsy as all heck, and was walking towards the refrigerator. In my sleepy state, I just kept walking and missed the flipping sofa's leg. Being the silly spoon that I was, I accidentally kicked the leg and it hurt my goshdarn little toe. I was squealing in pain, ""FRICK! SHOOT!"" By golly it was painful. I don't know why I kept the fluffing sofa over there. I don't even know why I have to keep it there of all the fuchsia places around.


In my frustration I kicked the leg again, and this time it fizzing hurt even more. Hurt like a monkey-fighter. It ached like a darn Monday-to-Friday, and I was shivering while checking it to see if it's a tad too gory[.](https://bpaste.net/show/2668036a81b1) I had to sit down to comfort the toe and calm myself down, while uttering ""Gobsmacking son of a snitch.""

TL;DR: Injured my toe, oh god no

edit: Gee jiminy cheese and crackers, it's a mod favorite!"
"TIFU by adding orange oil to my bath and getting chemical burns everywhere


So this fuck up actually happened about an hour ago and I'm still feeling the consequences. 

Tonight after returning from the gym I decided that I deserved a nice facial and bath.  I made preparations for this evening event and thought a candle sounded nice.  You know, to set the mood and put out them good smelly smells. I got my orange scented candle and trotted off for my bath.  Now sometimes when I treat myself I put a few drops of lavender oil in the bath, but I also have some pure extracted orange oil.  I've never used this in the tub, only to put on my wrists and whatnot, but tonight seemed like a great time to break it out.  I put two cap fulls of it in the hot bubbly water (I'm guessing like a 1/2-1 tsp) and I hop on in to enjoy. A few minutes later my fuck up makes its presence fully known.

Well I'm browsing reddit and enjoying the bath, the back of my knee start burning.  It's mild at first and I figured it was a weird gym related cut reacting to the water.  I felt around and got nothing so like an idiot I ignored it.  Soon it's both of my knees and it feels on fire! I finally figured out it was the oil! I jump up, turn the shower on, and start trying to washing this crap off.  Alas, to no avail, the damage was done!  Eventually the burning spreads from my knees all the way to my butt, inner thighs, lower back, and shoulders.  Everything felt so hot and just on fire. To describe this sensation I'll let you imagine rubbing sandpaper on the worst sunburn you've ever had.  Sounds real nice, right? I was screaming and hysterical in the freezing shower burning my skin off while crying. 

The burning wasn't getting better and I kept seeing visions of my skin falling off.  Terrified and in horrible pain I gathered the strength to call my husband, who wasn't home at the time.  After screaming/sobbing the story as best I could he quickly came to his hot, naked, and wet wife's aid.  (Trust me it was the least attractive I've ever been I'm sure.) We googled orange oil chemical burns and found a few answers but I basically just had to take a half hour long ice cold shower until the burning stopped.  Everything is pretty much better now, the skin feels raw and bumpy but it only stings a little.  I'm just lucky it didn't get in more sensitive areas.  I know now this oil isn't for bath time, and should have been diluted with a carrier oil at least.  

Thanks for reading and joining in my pain.  Half way through I made a joke that at least I had a pretty good TIFU now. I figured it was time to pay for how much I laugh at you guys!

TL;DR added orange oil to my bath tonight, reacted to it and got chemical burns, then had to call husband to come home and help me, took a long cold shower to cool off my burns and it still hurts... I completely ruined my relaxing night! 

Update: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for everyone's concern and tips!  For those telling me I should have used olive oil, I actually did use that after my husband read that soap and water doesn't always work.  It seemed to help get the orange off pretty well. When I woke up this morning everything was completely fine, no trace of the event at all.  I'm glad it's over and I at least made you all laugh and I got some karma out of the deal too. Thanks! "
"Tifu by riding a bike


This happened yesterday after 3:30. Me and my mate come out of school and thought it would be a great idea to swap bikes on the way home from school. Soon after we swap bikes and start riding home. About 3 minutes after riding I lost control of the bike and went face first into a brick wall. I watched as 2 of my teeth roll across the floor as Im realising what happened.We call an ambulance as im spitting blood into the pavement. The ambulances were busy but we waited and no ambulance arrived. 30 minutes later im taken to hospital by car and I have xrays taken and had my braces pulled out as the hooks dug into my mouth. then sent to the dentist and had my teeth put back in. I can only eat soft food for 2 weeks now and have no school. 

Tl;dr Rode friend's bike home, lose control of bike and lose my teeth, teeth then put back in and im on a soft diet."
"TIFU by bricking a computer with Rick Astley


Most April fool's day I don't do anything, but last night I was the last one in the office and decided to prank a few of my less techy coworkers. The first thing I did was turn off auto sleep, then I pulled up a fake update website and full screened it so unless they pressed F11 they couldn't exit the browser. The last thing I decided to do was play Rick Astley's 'Never Going to Give You Up' in a new tab at low volume so it would just mildly disturb them. Now that the prank was set up I turned the video on loop and full screened the fake update, and then I went home.
        When I came in the next day I was excited to see how they would react but when I got to the office I didn't hear any Rick Astley, but I did see a few irritated coworkers. Apparently on the old office computers it had overheated from running all night and now the computers won't turn on. Now I owe several hundred dollars in computer repairs and I am probably the least favorite in the office :(

TL;DR tried to prank coworkers with Rick Astley, ran the YouTube video all night, in the morning multiple computers were bricked. Now I owe several hundred dollars and I am now the least favorite in the office."
