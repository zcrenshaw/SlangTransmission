"TIFU by trying to save someone from being robbed.


Obligatory this did not happen today, but around nine month ago. On a weekend we had planned a night out with some friends. An old chap of mine who moved a year ago came over and needed a place to crash, so I invited him over to my place. 

Later that night we started drinking at home before moving over to a club which was about ten minutes by foot from my place. At the club I rapidly spend all of my cash on drinks. I asked the buddy who stayed with me to lend me some money so i could keep partying with them. He happily obliged and we partied until about 04.30 AM before making our way back home. Since he lend me around 50 bucks and was due to leave relatively early in the morning, I decided it would be the best thing to give back the money right away so i wouldn't forget it. So naturally, before going home we went to the next ATM where I wanted to grab enough cash to pay him back, but as we approached the ATM, two guys who were standing right in front of the ATM started to fight each other. 

In my drunk mind - I was ABSOLUTELY smashed, we had been drinking since eight hours - I was pretty sure that someone was being robbed when one of those two guys pinned down the other one to the ground. I turned to my buddy and told him to call the cops while I darted towards those two persons on the ground. I grabbed the one on top, who was holding the bottom guy in a joint lock, and pulled him off while telling him to stop and keep calm.

Now, this is were the Fuck-up happened. I was totally perplexed when all of a sudden the whole place was crowded with people rushing towards me. I was quickly brought to the ground and also pinned down with a joint lock. I shouted to my buddy to call the police asap, but he was too smashed to get his phone to work. 
So while Im lying on the ground shouting something like: ""Call the fucking Cops! Call the fucking Cops, shit's going down!"", the guy pinning me down leans in to my ear and whispers: ""We are the Cops."", all while handcuffing me.

It felt like it was straight out of a mobster movie.
Well, as it turns out, i did NOT observe a Robbery, but what actually went down was an undercover cop making an arrest. I totally busted that arrest and got a pretty bad scratch on my chin and nearly a dislocated shoulder from being tackled and held in that joint lock. Cops were pretty pissed too.

TL;DR: Wanted to save someone from being robbed. Busted an undercover arrest."
"TIFU by almost killing my coworkers


Like usual, this didn't actually happen today, but a while ago. 

My first job was working at a local pizza place, it was really chill to the point where it was pretty common for employees to be drunk and/or high while on the clock. One night, I (as the youngest on shift) was left to mop up the back room while everyone else was chilling on the patio for a bit since we were pretty much done for the night. Its pretty late at this point so I'm trying to fill up the bucket so I can start, and I see a couple of the many spray bottles we have lying around that are always full of some really mild cleaning solution. I was impatient and figured our mild cleaning solution would be fine mixed with bleach (which is what we were using on the floor) so I dumped the bottles in in an effort to fill the bucket faster.

Buckets full, dump in bleach, begin to mop.

A few minutes in, I start to notice that I'm feeling a bit lightheaded and nauseous, but I figure its just because I've been working for almost eight hours at this point without an actual break.

It's been probably 20 minutes or so since I was sent back to mop so one of my coworkers came back to check on me and they immediately noticed something was wrong, yell something about the smell. Mutual realization that something is definitely Wrong. Check the bottles, turns out I accidentally managed to find the one solitary bottle of vinegar thats used to scrub the oven and dumped that in with my bleach, thus making chlorine gas. Ended up having to air out the entire restaurant for probably 40 minutes. Luckily my manager thought it was kind of funny and was glad I didn't accidentally kill us.

tl;dr accidentally waged chemical warfare in restaurant kitchen



edit: a lot of people are saying something along the lines of ""never mix cleaning products dumbass!"" yeah i know i passed high school chemistry too; i was a tired 17 year old and i thought i was adding hella diluted dish soap (which i had seen be added before with absolutely no ill effects), not the one singular spray bottle of vinegar"
"TIFU by going to the wrong interview


Unlike normal tifu manner, this was actually today. Maybe an hour ago.

I'm turning 17 this month and was trying to get my second job ever. I applied to many places, and finally got a call back. I was told ""Go to chili's at 2 pm on friday"" this is where the fu begins.

I was excited for the interview, obviously, and told my parents and a couple friends about it. Finally the day is here, and I leave about 30 minutes early just in case. I go in, and the interviewer is taking quite a while, which is the first sign to me that something is wrong. He finally comes out, it all goes smoothly, but he says ""We aren't currently in much need of new team members, but you must've been called for a reason."" Second sign something's wrong. 

We shake hands and I leave, and I decided to check my calls. 

I look up the number to see which store it's for, as it didn't match the one I was at.

Except

It's not chili's at all

It was Tilly's.

So not only did I confuse some poor manager, I missed out on the real job opportunity. 

TL;DR: went to wrong interview, possibly missed out on job 

Edit: Geez, okay so I understand ""Rip my inbox"" now. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. I want to say thank you everyone for your advice, and maybe clear up a couple things.

I applied to both places, and they're within a few hundred feet of each other. I heard it wrong on the phone and mixed it up.

I called Tilly's as soon as I realized my mistake and let them know what happened.

Yes, I know it was dumb. 

I'll update when I figure out more.

Edit 2: To the people saying ""Call and explain, they might think it's funny."" They did.

Edit 3: Well, no one's really gonna see this now, but I have a second interview tomorrow. Wish me luck! "
"TIFU something that should be on the outside is now on the inside


This actually happened only a few hours ago. I was laying on the couch watching Wedding Crashers  this afternoon. Taking a well deserved break after my last final yesterday. 

When I watch movies I have a habit of putting my wedding ring in my mouth and flipping it between my lips and teeth with my tongue. I rarely even realize that I'm doing it. I let out a thunderous laugh during the ""notch on your belt"" line. 

My ring slid down into my throat and playing a dangerous game between my trachea and esophagus. And it chose my trachea. I sat up rapidly and coughed to clear it from my windpipe. It only moved enough to clear out of my trachea. But the ring was still sitting in the back of my throat. So when I reflexively swallowed the ring travelled down my esophagus and ended up nestling itself deep in my stomach. 

Immediately I realized my fuck up. Which was reiterated by the doctor at the hospital. ""Don't put anything in your mouth that you don't intend on consuming."" Thanks doc. 

Well now I have to poop sift. 


And tell my wife. 


Marriage is indeed a hard pill to swallow. 

TL;DR I swallowed my wedding ring and still haven't told my wife. 

Edit: I posted a comment down below with a link to the X-ray. 

Edit 2: For all who are interested. I have not told my wife yet. She is out of town. Will update when I tell her. 

Edit 3: For clarity. "
"TIFU By Putting Magnets Near My Dick [NSFW]


As usual, not today but a few years ago. Throwaway for sanity

Let's set the scene. It's 3AM in a basement in the middle of central Canada during the Winter. Acid Jazz is playing over a laptop with a few dongles attached various wires running off to a breadboard on my worn out wooden desk. Soft pings of messages constantly floating in from IRC channels and the smell of stale cigarettes fill the space.

I was cutting sleep to play around with some new sensors I had picked up, in this case a [Reed Switch [image]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Reedrelay.jpg). For those that aren't geeks, it's a device that detects the presence of a magnetic field completing the circuit only when near a magnet is near. I'm playing around with an Arduino and get it all set up with live graphing over the serial link thinking maybe I can use this for managing the timing of a [POV wheel on my bike or something](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/images/000/001/091/medium800/Bike-Wheel-POV-Display-adafruit-thumbnail.jpg?1448302256). My girl texts me some dirty stuff and suddenly I get a bright idea. [DICK SCIENCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics)

This is not the first time I've had this happen. In physics class I measured the height of my dick off the groud and came in a perfectly horizontal position to calculate the average velocity of my jizz (33KPH). Using this number later and a scale I even got the force of impact. 

Eyeing up the now-flat graph I pull out the two small cubed 1/2cm neodymium magnets I had ordered and loosen the buckle, throwing some porn on the other monitor to kickstart the process. Let the boys in IRC know what's going down and stand above the mess of wires ready for the sweet sweet data. Realizing this magnet won't stay in place I opt for placing the other magnet on the opposite side of my cock (it beat the duct tape). Surprised that the thing would stay in place with only minor deformation I start pumping away at air. 

The data starts flowing in, and graphs are being generated and everything is just peachy. A little sad that I didn't have a way to accurately measure over time and more focused on the graphs, my erection started to wane. And with that my foreskin rolls back on over dislodging the magnets. In a second the top one gets knocked off and falls the bottom however rolls under the skin. Then the wonderful force of magnetism sucks them back into each other making a wonderful foreskin sandwich.

[Ever heard of the Inverse Cube Law](https://media.quizizz.com/resource/gs/quizizz-media/questions/L2FwcGhvc3RpbmdfcHJvZC9ibG9icy9BRW5CMlVxTTFBeXJDSjY1aHVSOEN0TGl2b1JXUm5mdDk5TkNZZmN3ekVuNjVaMlA0T0ViV0x2MGhabWNRY19NQ0QwV0JqazJZeno1STJoUV9RdkZwUlhyQUlNVkVWeWgwQS5ib1UycWJ4YlZqTXU1Ym9f)? If not, the force between two magnets is greater the smaller it is. How thick is a squished foreskin?

**t=0**
I yelp, but mostly out of shock and try digging these magnets out of my cock. At first I dig some fingers in there but the precum is preventing me from getting a grip. Sitting down in my chair I tab on over to IRC and update the boys on my experimental developments while trying to figure out the next step. There's a few tools around me but the needlenose pliers and [vicegrip seem like good option](https://youtu.be/Vt8NOdINJ1s?t=46s). So I kick back in my chair, throw my legs on the desk and dive into my dick with two sets of needlenose pliers. Not regular ones, but the ones with super fine points for mounting SMD components. The things just can't hold onto the bits of metal and keep slipping around. After getting a solid grip and applying a ton of force, the thing slips off and nearly stabs a hole in my dick.

**t=20min**
I light a dart and ponder what the fuck I'm going to do, trying to avoid waking my dad up to run me to a hospital. Can I slide it out? Maybe? I'm losing feeling pretty quick so I decide to give it a shot. Grabbing my housecoat I slip upstairs and hop in the shower. Applying liberal amounts of soap to the area does absolutely fuck all. These magnets just can't be shook. While cleaning myself up and reconsidering my life choices, I decide to call in the big guns. 

**t=35min**
Now soaking wet I throw on my housecoat, grab the shop keys, spark a dart and head outside. It's the middle of Canadian winter out here 
(-35C (-31F)) and my nice wet hair starts freezing instantly, but the slippers keep everything warm for the short run. I get into the shop and stumble through the lawnmowers and welders in the dark to the light switch above the workbench. Reaching over the bench to where I think the switch is I hear a nick loud **click**.

**t=40min**
Good News: I found the [bench vice](http://l450v.alamy.com/450v/g3jcyk/old-blue-battered-bench-vice-g3jcyk.jpg).

Bad News: My dick is now stuck to the side of a metal bench vice.

I try to move the magnets around but the rough texture of the vice prevents it, I can't get a grip to pull them off and there's jack shit for other tools within reach. I take a pull from my dart and then I feel it. Slowly creeping through my cock is that sweet sweet Canadian winter, All -35C of it.

Thoughts start racing. There's no one awake within earshot, and within 10 minutes I'll have severe frostbite. Do I start screaming only for someone find me in the dark with my cock stuck to a workbench? Do I take it like a man and just die peacefully out here? Rip my cock off? I can't even bend to get under the bench. The way I see it, there's only one option with three outcomes. I'm going to have to rip my dick off this bench, that much is certain. The magnets might stay attached, stay attached to the bench and leave a gaping hole in my dick, or separate. 

I finish my dart and say a quick prayer. Closing my eyes I lean back throwing all my weight backwards and the cock stretches out like a taught violin string. Followed by a sharp pain.

**t=45min**
I start screaming, hands clamped around my cock. A few seconds later my body is filled with this amazing wave of relief (like orgasm but 40x better). And looking up I can just barely make out the outline of **one** of the magnets. Thank fucking Christ is all I can think fishing out the other one.

I managed to get minor frostbite but feeling returned to the area a few minutes later. The entire area was bruised in a perfect 1/2cm square. A few weeks later after it healed I'm still left with a discolored square on the bottom of my cock. A testament to curiosity and stupidity. 

I usually tell this story only when I'm really drunk, or someone notices the scar.

TL;DR Microelectronics lead to sweet dick scars

"TIFU by not reading the sympathy card


So we have this thing at work, which I'm sure is common in many workplaces, where when a life event happens that warrants a department wide greeting card (retirement, birth of child, death of family member, etc) to be delivered to an individual the card is put in a manilla envelope with a list of all the employees in the department and a description of what the card is for.  The idea is to sign the card, cross your name off, and hand it to another person on the list whos name isn't yet crossed off.  

So a few minutes ago, a coworker pops in and hands me the envelop.  Me, being wrapped up in my work, opened the envelope and saw that it was a ""Sympathy"" card.  I quickly signed it with a cheap cookie-cutter response, ""Sorry for your loss ~ Breakfastbeerz"" crossed my name off, stuffed it in the envelope, and read who was next.  Fortunately, the walk wasn't far as my office neighbor's name was still available.  I popped my head in his office and told him, ""Here's another card to sign"", and walked out.

About 30 seconds later, my neighbor comes into my office holding the envelope, with a really sour look on his face, and drops it on my desk, ""I don't think you intended to give this to me"", he walked out.  I opened the card and finally got around to reading it.  Low and behold, the card was for him.  His mother had passed away a few days ago and I just gave him his own sympathy card and asked him to sign it.  I feel like such an ass.

TL;DR Quickly signed a sympathy card without reading it.  Gave it to a coworker to sign, it was a sympathy card for his own mother whom had just passed away."
"TIFU By smoking two cigarettes in quick succession


So I started my new job as an aviation engine technician about two months ago, pretty stressful start to the job as I had a whirlwind induction to the world of engine repair. This stressful time made my cigarette intake span over the working day, whereas before I only smoked at home.

So fast forward to today, I got into work at 6AM, way before anybody else, as I had some things to do, and time dragged very slowly, it is usually a very interesting job, but today was clearly just a bad day! 

At 9.15 we have our first break of the day, and I went over to my toolbox, and rolled myself some cigarettes. Now usually I would only have one on my break, as it's only 15 minutes long and that's usually enough for me. Well today I thought it would be a great idea to smoke two cigarettes in quick succession as the morning had been very boring. 

I made my way over to the smoking hut, and sparked up my first cigarette, this was fine, and after I was feeling content. Then came the second cigarette. About half way through I felt a bit funny, but ignored the feeling and finished it. 

Now on the walk back to my working area, I was rounding the corner from the smoking hut and my vision went completely black, I tried to grasp onto something but fainted, and hit my head on the floor. Not sure how long had passed when I came too, could've been a couple of seconds, could've been a minute for all I know. The first thing I remember is a guy shouting and running over to see if I was alright (luckily this guy was our first aid employee!)

The rest of the story consists of being sick due to concussion, being fussed over by upper management about how an ambulance was needed to cover their insurance, and eventually being dropped off to the emergency department of the hospital in the company van!

I now have a golf ball sized lump on the back of my head and a pretty killer headache!

Tl:dr; Smoked two cigarettes in a row, got a major head rush, fainted and got concussion from hitting my head on the floor!

Edit: Grammar

Update: Wow this has blown up over night! Nice to see you all getting a kick over my misfortune ;) when there were less comments last night I could reply to them all, but that would take hours now so just thought I'd say here that yes I've decided to completely give up smoking cold turkey.

 I realised it could've been a lot worse if I'd fallen over a little bit to the left as there was a large steel pipe jutting out of the floor! I want to make sure that the situation doesn't happen again and the only way to do so is by quitting, so thanks for all of the motivational messages and methods, they've helped a lot!

Update 2: noticed a few people saying stuff like 'Yeah sure it's a normal cigarette' etc etc, I'm in my dream career, I'm in the best place to eventually become an aviation engineer. I'm not going to risk that by lighting up at work lmao. Plus I offered to do a drug test after, as the first aider did ask me whether I had smoked anything else, to which they declined and said they trusted me."

"TIFU by Making my wife think I was having an affair


As tradition in this sub this did not happen today but 10 years ago. I am now divorced but was still married at the time. Now on to the FU.

I had a corporate meeting with employee's from all over the US. Of course we introduce ourselves and shake hands as people come into the conference room. The meeting goes as planned and I present my portion. Meeting breaks up and hand shaking begins. Having drank a lot of coffee I was REALLY in need of the restroom. I march off to the restroom and this is the point of which I messed up. I did not was my hands before touching my junk - only after. What I did not think about was the women's perfume that I collected onto my hands and then transferred to my privates. That night the wife wanted to get frisky despite me having just arrived from the airport and exhausted. Of course she smelled the perfume and flipped out. She was convenced that I was pushing her off because I had an tryst instead of working an 80 hour week. To this day her dumb ass does not believe me but she it totally not my problem these days. [This wasn't the main reason for the divorce but an event that lead me to realize that something was off.]

TL;DR - shook hands with several ladies, transferred perfume to my privates during a bathroom break, and wife smelled the perfume.

Edit: 1 - 
 * Congratulations on thinking that everyone uses the same kind of perfume and no one uses their hand to smear it in. IDK if it was stinky lotion, oil, perfume or whatever.
* At this point in my life and with my ex completely gone I would have no problem admitting an affair. It would still make a good TIFU.
* To those saying I am lying and smells dont last more than a few hours I am baffled - this is not rocket science.
* Its easy to call FAKE and not back it up - harder to disprove to the fools online. 
* I just was reminded of this story because of something that occurred at work. Coworker gave me a hug and my damn shirt stunk the next day when I did laundry. 
* 75 emails in the hour and half drive from work. 

Edit 2: My ex was having a lot of affairs and lying. She would brag about manipulating me to friends, chats, and emails. Since we were open as a couple it was about honesty. In the end she could care less about me but if she could hold something over my head to manipulate then that is what she would do. She spent diaper and formula money once on beer and cigarettes and told me to figure it out when I was broke one week. 

She would project and twist to her advantage. She would even leave our 4 year old at home alone and party when I was working out of town. I even had people stop by to check on my son - he was hiding in the closet. He is grown now and fine.


edit 3: Also I just wanted to tell a funny story. I don't need a pat on the back and I see now I should not have been honest about the divorce because of shit people. I had no reason to lie or improve the story. If I had cheated I would be proud and even more proud to shove into her face right then and there. At the time I was trying to get her help and get on track financially. My mother had just died and I lost our home.  My real fuckup in life was thinking she could be helped. I dont trust anymore. I have given up dating. Stupid fucking people. I cant even post images without being told I didnt take it or that its fake.

"TIFU: Mixing up two containers = $1,500 mistake


TLDR: I mixed up containers and sprayed round-up on 250,000 sqft of campus just in time for graduation.

So.... I am a full time teacher + part-time maintenance worker at a high school and part of my job is to take care of the area surrounding the gym and center campus before major events such as Graduation, Alumni Weekend, and the visitation weekend by prospective students. 

A few weeks ago I get the campus looking pretty awesome after planting a few hundred flowering plants, mulching everything, and pulling weeds until my fingers have a permanent green tint to them. After this I started to work on the center campus and parking lot grass which for some ungodly reason has been completely taken over by dandelions. I go to the store and pick up several large containers of bargain name round up and more containers of something to spray on the lawn and kill broad-leaf plants. So after teaching a full load of classes I got on the tractor, filled up the sprayer and sprayed for the next three to four hours every single square inch of the center campus and area around the main parking lot. I come back to fill up my final load and I'm out of the chemical mix, to late in the day to run to Home Depot to pick up more so I decide to edge the parking lot and cracks to kill the weeds. I reach under the work bench to get the other canister of 'round-up' and pull out instead a completely full container of Tri-mec lawn-safe broad leaf weed killer. Stomach sank to my feet as I realized that I had just sprayed the entire campus with round up. Every. Damn. Inch. All this is perfect timing because graduation will be the weekend that all the grass is supposed to be completely dead. 

Now im researching how to reseed 250,000 sqft of lawn and calculating how much I'll have to spend to get the grass looking nice by August. The seed alone is gonna cost $1,500 minimum.
