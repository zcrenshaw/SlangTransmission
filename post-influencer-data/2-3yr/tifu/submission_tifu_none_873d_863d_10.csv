"TIFU by listening to my GF's obviously stupid game.


So, yesterday my girlfriend and I were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.

Now, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

Long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). Since yesterday, peeing still hurts. She thought I wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

TL;DR I fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**Edit**: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down, I am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well I hope you didn't). Sorry, I'm keeping it up. See you at 8."
"TIFU by spilling a massive amount of blood in a public park


So, my lady friend gets a call from her cousin saying he has a college film project due, but can't seem to get his fake blood to look just right. She is a theatre/ photography type, so she agrees to help him whip up some better stage blood. 

So we do, but its still not quite right. It looks perfect to the naked eye, but still not perfect on camera. 

So its getting pretty late. We decide to take the bottle home and work on adding a little more pigment to help it out. We were parked on the other side of a large park. At this pont it's almost 11pm and we haven't seen anyone the entire walk. 

As we are walking, I'm talking with my hands when I hit her arm and knock the bottle out of her hand on a concrete wheelchair ramp. 

The bottle splits open and every drop of ""blood"" pours out. All 32oz. It looked like a Tarantino flick. Its running down the ramp. Real horror show. 

But we're not too worried. First of all its threatening to rain, so we figure it will wash away. Also there aren't alot of people in the park. So we figure if nothing else we will get to the car, fill a bottle with water and go wash it down, if it doesn't rain before. 

We walk about 10 more minutes to the car, fill a bottle with water from the fountain and start driving back. Until we see the police SUV flying down the road toward us. Hauling ass, lights blazing

He hits us with the spotlight, but then turns it off and pulls into the nearest parking lot closest to the spill. I'm like ""we should tell him"" but she is a bit freaked out. So I say ""ok I'll pull into a good spot, leave you in the car and run and tell em what happened."" As soon as I pull over another cop in a cruiser pulls up and tells us we need to clear the area. I'm like ""well...I wanted to..."". And he drives off midsentence toward the other cop. 

Then another cruiser comes. This cop motions for us to leave. So we do as she said. I wasn't looking forward to talking to them anyway.

Not sure whatever came of it, but I'm sure they figured it out. 

TL,DR - Walking in a park. Carrying stage blood from a film project. Drop it. It goes everywhere. Looks like a slaughter has taken place. Police are summoned. We make our getaway. "
"TIFU By Bringing A Magnet To School


I'm a high school senior.
I'm what you would call a mischievous student.
I bought a magnet.
It's a pretty big magnet.
Pretty cool looking magnet.
Pretty fucking strong magnet.
I brought said magnet to school.
I showed all my friends.
Wed a little ""Test Your Strength"" booth that the security guards took part in.
Point was to take it off a locker.
Fun stuff.
I had the magnet in my hand.
I should've had it in the cardboard protective wrap.
I walked into English Class and went straight to my teacher's desk to ask a question.
I forgot I was holding said magnet.
Said magnet jumps out of my hand and attaches to the drawer.
All metal in the drawer jumped to where the magnet was stuck.
There were CDs in the drawer.
The stuff that flew must've scratched and cracked some CDs.
CDs were unreadable.
I was laughing too hard to take it off the desk.
The substitute teacher was too weak to pry it off.
He called maintenance to remove the magnet.
Then security to remove me.
I now have a Saturday School Detention and am facing a suspension for ""destruction of property.""
I feel bad so I'll replace the CDs.

TL;DR: Don't bring a magnet to school.

"TIFU by losing everything I own to a pigeon...


Throw away because my friends know my main account. I'm sure they'll hear about this at some point, but right now I really don't want to deal with being the butt of their jokes.

Anyway, I'm moving countries and have been selling my stuff in this last week. Today I sold the final item on our list of things to sell (apart from the car), to someone and offered to drive it to them because they couldn't fit it in their own. 

I get paid and put the cash in my wallet with the rest of the cash from literally everything else we sold and headed home. 

On my way back, there was a car stopped in the middle of a 2 lane/2 way road with a lady running around around her car, throwing her hands up in the air and looking quite helpless. I stick my head out the window and asked if she needed any help and it turns out that there's an injured pigeon on the road and she was trying to catch it to get it out of harms way. 

I get out and chase the pigeon, caught the little guy, and walked him out to a little area where I knew he'd be safe and went back on my way. 

When I got home, I realize that my wallet wasn't in my pocket. No Biggie, I must have left it in the car. 

Nope. 

I'm not really sure what happened, but I'm guessing I must have left the thing on my lap or something, got out and lost it there, but I could not find it when I went back. Nearly $6,700 down the drain. 

Maybe my fuck up was waiting until I sold everything before I put it into my bank account, or not just putting it in a fucking sock or something. Either way, I basically lost the earnings for everything I owned to this goddamn pigeon.

I hope that pigeon lives to be fat and plump because if I hear that a cat got him, it would have all been for nothing.

**TLDR: I sold everything in my house and got absolutely nothing for it because I lost my wallet whilst rescuing a fucking pigeon** 

*EDIT: Woah. I never thought this would get so much attention. I really appreciate all the love and all the lovely messages you've sent me. I also wholeheartedly agree with everyone pointing out how much of an idiot I was for keeping so much money with me in person (this is why I'm here on this sub). I fucked up big time.* 

*I spoke to my wife about it, and she's an absolute legend. I know she was upset, but she never overtly showed it and just told me that it will be alright and we'll get through it. I'm so lucky to have someone awesome like her in my life. I was panicking about this, but she's amazing. I think I owe her a big holiday sometime.* 

*Also, to those of you suggesting the gofundme thing, that's awfully generous of you. It's really cool to see people band together to do shit like that. There's a lot of stuff happening in the world right now gives me a bleak glimpse of what humanity has come to nowadays, but it's people like you who glimmer like diamonds in the dirt. You're awesome.* 

*I know it's a lot of money, but I've always strongly believed in facing the consequences of your actions (or inaction in this case), learning from it and moving on. The help is greatly appreciated, but it just doesn't sit right with me to have strangers fund a totally avoidable situation. I fucked up, and now I must deal with it. I'm also not completely broke or anything like that. We could've made it through fine without the money from our old stuff, but it's just a shame to have lost it all - especially since we considered shipping some of the more expensive stuff. Gah!*

*Those of you asking me to check back where I lost it, I have! So have the police. I mentioned in a comment that they were pretty certain I would never get it back. Either someone's picked it up, or an animal's taken it. They will keep an eye out for it. Also, it's a lot a money! Of course I've also thoroughly checked my car, and I definitely had it on me because I put the money into my wallet just before I drove off. The only stop was the pigeon rescue.*

*The lady could've been a scam artist, but it just seemed quite unlikely for a few reasons; she was driving a fairly expensive car, she was with me the whole time, she drove off just in front of me and she was alone. Perhaps there was an accomplice involved, there's no ruling that out, but it just didn't seem likely. I think I just dropped the bloody thing under my car when I got out and didn't see it when I got back to my car. I even vaguely recall seeing something in my rearview mirror as I drove away, but at this point I don't even know if that's just my mind making it up or something.* 

*Also, those of you wanting us to run over the pigeon - shame! That's terrible! I would've taken it home if I wasn't moving. I actually have no regrets saving the thing. I just wish I was more careful with our cash, or less lazy and less stupid. Lesson learned I guess.* 

*Thanks for all the e-hugs. You guys rule :)*

*Edit 2: Oh yeah, for those of you wondering how I fit that much money in my wallet, I'm not from America nor do I live there. I only converted the amount to USD because there are more Americans on here than any other nationality (ans besides, most people can relate to USD). We have bigger amounts in notes where I live, but yeah my wallet was still pretty thick!* 

*Also, for some of you who think I'm trying to scam people into feeling bag for me and paying me, as I said earlier, I do not want your money, nor am I asking for help. I just wanted to share a fuck up just like everyone else on this sub.*

*Hope that covers all the FAQ's!*"
"TIFU by getting angry with a man pushing into the queue for the plane on the way back from deployment...


Obligatory happened a while ago... I am ex British Military, 845 squadron, Commando Helicopter Force to be precise. When I left the military civilian life didn't agree with me so I went into close protection specialising in hostile environment and anti terrorism. Working primarily in the Middle East, after one long deployment we were coming home through Sri Lanka. Unlike the British who everyone knows we just love to queue and play by the rules, people in that part of the world don't share the same ideals.

So me and my team are queuing to go through security and a Sri Lankan guy tried to push in smashing my trolley out of the way, I say ""ow pal, get to the back of the queue!"" He then looks annoyed but ultimately does as I ask. We next get through security and get to passport control, again the same issue! I politely remind the men that there is a queue system and point to the back, they join the back of the queue whilst giving me the evils.

Then my finest moment, bare in mind I have been deployed for two months away from home and fed next to nothing and lived in horrendous conditions, I'm tired and hungry, desperate to get home and fed up of the lack of respect for other people displayed in this part of the world. We are queueing for the plane now and a guy pushes past us followed by about ten kids going to the front of the queue... I lose my rag ""OW PAL! (He turns around and looks at me) Yeah you! There's a queue here get to the back of it for gods sake!"" 

The the children all turn round, they are all wearing sunglasses... strange? Then I notice them all with white sticks... oh dear... he was escorting ten blind children onto the plane and given priority. I immediately apologise and proceed to ensure roughly ten hours of piss taking and impressions and recounting of the tale in various ways all more embellished than the last to make it funnier by my team (as is per military tradition) the air hostesses who we normally end up getting friendly (in more ways than one) with wouldn't even talk to me or give me any refreshments. And to top it off I will probably burn in hell...

TL:DR got sick of people pushing in a queue and by the third time I told someone off for it realised he was escorting blind kids to the from of the queue

Edit - holy shit this blew up, just like to say thanks to Naz at the kebab stand! Without you my Saturdays would be meaningless, struggling to reply to a lot of the comments as I'm boring now with kids and chores but thank you for the kind comments I really appreciate it I hope you all have a lovely day

Edit 2 - I also don't feel bad about this just wanted to tell a funny story... prob not all that funny if you weren't there and if that's the case my apologies for wasting your day lol

Edit 3 - if you're anti military or just want to comment some bullshit propaganda you read in a magazine that all military lads/lasses are scum please do it elsewhere. I have limited tolerance and don't want to waste it on internet trolls today"
"TIFU by sending the Navy Seal copypasta over live chat to a company whilst at college.


Obligatory this didn't happen today.

So me and my classmates were often left on our own by our teacher. As you'd expect we got bored and being young we'd do the usual office chair jousting and what-not.

Well one day we're surfing the web looking for stupid websites to keep us amused and came across a horrendous yet glorious mess of a website for a car leasing company. I'm sure plenty can guess who it is; I'll leave that to you.

So we carry on perusing it until we spot that they have live chat... **bingo**.

Now we aren't taking this website seriously; we all thought that it's some kind of bot and fueled by our adolescent idiocy, decided to mess with it.

&gt;*THEM*: Hi I'm [insert name], how can I help?

&gt;*ME*: Hi I'm Mike Litoris, I'm looking to lease a car.

&gt;*THEM*: Sure Mike, anything in particular?

&gt;*ME*: Something with a big trunk.

&gt;*THEM*: Perhaps a SUV then?

&gt;*ME*: A pussy wagon?! Good thinking.

&gt;*THEM*: Ok, but please refrain not using language like that or I'll have to end the chat.

&gt;*ME*: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

*A couple of minute pass...*

&gt; *THEM*: We can see your IP and notice it belongs to [insert college name]. We will now forward this onto your college administration.

**fuck.**

**It wasn't a bot.**

Scramble ensues to clear browser history, pull out the network cable &amp; shut down the computer... *like it will make any difference.* We agree not to talk of it and hope they were just trying to scare us.

...

**About a week later**


We're sat in class, they were *obviously* bluffing: we all think it's blown over. 

The head of department, my tutor and college deputy walk in. Oh shit.

&gt;Deputy: (My name)? follow me.

I make the walk of shame to the Principal's office, then I'm sat down at a table with a load of people I've never seen before.

It turns out the company emailed the **entire** conversation directly to the Principal and it was forwarded onto every member of the college administration. The IT support team then looked through everyone's history to find out who visited the website and of course, I had.

I was in there for at least a couple of hours. The highlight being explaining what the Navy Seal copypasta is to the college principal and admin team.

Somehow, I wasn't suspended despite taking all the wrap but was watched constantly for the rest of my time at college and had to stay after college for a few weeks.

Still, it's safe to say, that was one of the dumbest things I ever did.

**TL;DR:** I sent the Navy Seal copypasta to a company over live chat at college and they sent the whole conversation to the principle and college admin team.

EDIT: To clarify i'm not in the US, so our definitions of principal and deputy aren't the same

EDIT 2: Whoa, this blew up while I was asleep.

EDIT 3: Cleaned up stuff that autocorrect changed to satisfy the grammar nazis."

"TIFU - By accidently guillotining my dick


Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

First off, my dick is still intact. Thank GOD. Anyway, this happened about four hours ago. I was moving an old table to my in-laws’ house. We decided to give them our old farm-style dinner table. You know, the kind with a leaf in the middle (this is important). 

My wife and I loaded the table with chairs into my tow-behind trailer with no problem. I head on over there and as soon as I arrived my brother-in-law, who looks like a two-legged moose -- Fuck it, we’ll call him ‘Moose’ – is waiting outside their apartment. I roll up and get out. As I am undoing the tie downs I ask him to take all the chairs out and carry them inside. Meanwhile, I am sliding the table, which is top down, out of the trailer. 

Now here’s where I fucked up. As I am tilting the table sideways it’s starting to open where the leaf goes. I don’t really think anything of it. However, the moment I get it completely sideways in my outstretched arms it slams shut….right on my dick shaft. Unfortunately, Moose is inside and I am stuck --for a lack of a better word. To make matters worse, I can’t pull the table apart in this position and I can’t set it down without yanking my wang off. I am standing there is agonizing fucking pain, frozen, for what felt like an eternity. 

Finally, Moose comes out and sees me there holding the table. I am probably pale white by this point. The good thing is that he doesn’t know how long I have been holding the table so he thinks nothing’s wrong. I, somehow, muster the words “Please help” without sounding too obvious that my shaft is lodged. Well, Moose grabs one end of the table and by the grace of God that causes it to open up a little bit. Instinctually, I drop my end and go to the Tebow position. Now, I have too much pride to tell Moose what was wrong, so I told him I ‘pinched a nerve’, which in hindsight is technically true. Right?

Anyway, with Moose’s help we carry the table to the apartment. All the while I’m fighting back tears. As soon as we put the table in place I made up some bullshit excuse why I couldn’t hang around and hurried back to my truck. I sat there for a good five minutes crying and making sure I didn’t snip the damn thing off. The good thing is that now it is massively swollen 😊. The bad thing is that now it is massively swollen. FML.

TLDR: Tried to lift a dinner table sideways and guillotined my dick. 

Edit: typos.

UPDATE: I was fully clothed for those wondering. I had a loose pair of workout shorts on at the time. Also, I went to the urgent care first thing this morning and the doctor said I will live. Yeah, that was embarrassing trying to explain.

"TIFU by attempting to be a ninja and destroying my lymphatic system


This one takes me back, probably the stupidest decision of my life. I was just a little kid back then, in the suburbs of Houston, Texas. I had a pretty vivid imagination and I was always role playing about being a ""soldier"" or a ""warrior"" or whatever. So this particular day, I was just playing in the back yard, pretending to be a ninja. Coincidentally at the same time frame, I had begun taking Kung fu lessons at a Chinese community center. (As a clumsy white kid, I was the laughing stock of the operation XD) I saw this nice firm shoot of bamboo in my yard and decided to wield it as my weapon, figuring with my martial arts, I would do something epic. I proceeded to sprint at the garage wall, in a attempt to pole vault up the side with my flimsy piece of bamboo. (Thinking back it really didn't make any logical sense) Instead, as I ran, I fell over a rock with the bamboo still in my grasp, and borderline skewered myself in the thigh with the bamboo shoot, now splintering and a couple inches deep through my skin. Blood immediately covered the area and I could feel the wood inside of my laceration. In all my pain, I was dizzy and disoriented removing the splinters from my thigh.
I could have never known that the damage would be much deeper. 

Over the course of a week my leg began to swell to twice its size. It was like nothing we had ever seen. The skin became soft and malleable, almost like a memory foam mattress. You could leave faint white streaks on my leg by simply touching and dragging a finger across. On top of this it was heavy, uncomfortable, and an embarrassment to have. After speaking to several specialists, my condition was identified as Lymphadema: A condition in which the lymphatic system fails to move fluid waste back into the bloodstream. I received that injury ten years ago, and must manage it through stockings worn daily, garments worn every night, and additional measures

TL;DR Pretended to be a ninja as a kid, found bamboo stick, impaled myself in thigh, suffered a permanent condition.

"TIFU by accidentally giving my mom a THC medical patch instead of a CBD medical patch.


So my mother uses CBD medical patches for her knees and back. She's had multiple surgeries. These patches help her more than the pain pills ever did to be honest. Anyways, we were at work, we own a business together. Her knees were hurting really bad and she had forgotten her pain pills; she doesn't like using the patch at work even though it doesn't get you high. I had remembered I had a patch in my car so I suggested she use it. But, I had also forgotten that this patch was a thc patch. I had purchased the wrong one about a week earlier. I went out and got it and immediately opened it; I didn't even look at the front of the package surprisingly. She put the patch on and about 30 min later she said she felt funny. She said she kept forgetting what she was doing. I looked at the package in the trash and finally found out about the patch. It was pretty funny in a way because she was making fun out of the situation instead of being mad or freaking out. But she did have to stay in the back office most of the day. 

TLDR: accidentally gave mom a thc patch instead of a cbd patch. Accidentally got mom high. "
"TIFU by thinking i'm more athletic than i am


About 4 years ago on the walk home from a drink fuelled evening with my then lady friend, i decided to try and show off by betting her she couldnt jump to touch a shop sign, and then demonstrating myself how it's done. Why I thought this was particuarly impressive, I really dont know.

Anywho, i succesfully touched the sign with the spring and grace of a basketball pro. Upon landing however, i felt my right foot give way and a sharp pain shoot up my leg.

So we hobbled back to my place and decided tomorrow's forecast was a trip to the hospital for an xray.

Funnily enough, after waiting for 6 hours, the doctors declared they couldnt see anything wrong with my foot and sent me hopping away, crutchless.

It wasnt untill 5 days later i got a call from a sheepish sounding receptionist who asked me very nicely to make my way back to the hospital for a CT scan, as the wise doctors had reviewed my xray and thought they had spotted a fracture.

It transpired that i cracked my heel and was given a moon boot, crutches and 4 weeks off my feet (no bar work, hurrah!).

Lesson learnt: know when youre not Michael Jordan.

TL;DR drunkenly jumped to touch a sign, showing off to my lady friend, cracked my heel.

"TIFU by almost gluing my teeth together


This happened yday actually. I decided to get away the big city and rent a remote shepherd's hut in the beautiful British countryside. This place is in the middle of grass land and houses can be seen in the distance...perfect. When I unpacked I realised I left my toothpaste behind so I drove 4 miles to the nearest shop to get some much needed beer and of course toothpaste. I picked up the first box I saw that looked like toothpaste got in my car and 4 miles later I am in remote paradise. After I had some food and a fair amount of alcohol I decided to sleep so went to brush my teeth. As I squeezed the paste on my brush I saw it had a funny texture but who cares now..I started brushing my teeth when instantly I realised something is wrong. It was sticky and funny tasting. I am like wtf and check the tube where I see ""Denture adhesive cream. Strong hold"". I went from 0 to 100 in miliseconds started yelling wtf wtf wtf. Thinking what do I do now? Strong hold? How fast is it??? If I glue my mouth together how am i going to call anyone? I will sound like DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street where he took those old ludes (for anyone not seen that bit it's hilarious). So in a moment of clarity I start frantically stuffing toilet paper in my mouth trying to scrape it off which helped a bit but I could see in the mirror the layer of denture adhesive all over my healthy teeth like plaster on a wall. Finally I managed to get all the adhesive of my brush and started brushing like a maniac with water to get that shit off my mouth. I must have brushed for 20 minutes when it finally came off. 

TL;DR I bought denture adhesive instead of toothpaste almost glued my teeth together."
"TIFU by trying to be funny and possibly ruined my life


So this happened approx. 3 weeks ago. 

To set the scene, I live in Canada, I am 18 years old, senior year of high school, Just about every single person knows me in the school, and have racked up a hefty amount of scholarships, bursaries and grants towards my chosen university. 

The end of the school year is coming to an end, and the senior film class is trying to get student actors to film and produce their final project. To get actors, many of them have posted their requests on our Grad class (approx. 200 people) Facebook page in a very generic structure : ""Looking for actors to film **** type of movie for film class, need X amount of people for X amount of time."" Me, trying to be edgy and funny, parodied those posts by using the same generic structure and made it seem like a documentary that needs cameramen, and if you don't volunteer as a cameramen, don't come to school tomorrow. Giving it the slight ""school shooter"" edge. The first three comments were people that understood the dry humor in it, and volunteered to it. Immediately afterwards I had to leave to start my first day at a new job.

Fast forward to approximately 11 PM, I return home from work exhausted, and I notice two police cars in my driveway, I park my car and walk towards my parents who are standing at the door crying, and I try to find out what's happening as the officers close in on me from behind. They walk me inside and tell me I'm under arrest for ""Uttering Threats"" and begin reading me my Miranda rights as both my parents sob. I am put in cuffs and am then lead to a cell and held there for a day. Though the short time I spent in jail, it honestly allowed me to understand how much it fucking sucks. You lose concept of time as there is nothing to do, nothing to track time by, and you're constantly shivering from the cold. 

The next day I was interrogated by cops, which I tried to explain everything, and that though I understand the fear it could have affected on someone, it was nothing more than a terribly executed joke. Fast forward time ( I am still unaware of what time it is at any given point) I get taken to the courthouse where my lawyer speaks on my behalf to the crown counsel and sets me free on bail, since I am not a danger to society. (lol?) Though the RCMP has recommended charges against me, and the crown counsel approved. Finally I am released, and taken home by my parents, where I learn that I was expelled from my school, where I was graduating at the top of my classes, and have lost a very large amount of money in scholarships, grants, and bursaries.

I am currently struggling to successfully graduate from high school on time, so far have lost 3,000$ on lawyer bills, and still haven't finished. And have a chance of having a criminal record that will stick with me for the rest of my life.

TL;DR : Tried to be edgy by parodying posts by my graduation class on Facebook graduation page, got arrested and charged, lost lots of money on lawyer bills, and even more on scholarships. Have a chance to fail to graduate meaning I forfeit my University acceptance. Have a chance at having a criminal record stick on me.

Edit : woah I didn't expect this to actually get any attention, honestly kinda wrote this for the sake of relief. though many people are trying to support me, it doesn't help to combat the shitty feeling I have constantly. And I was one of the most uplifting person in school. 

If you have any questions on this situation ask away I'll try to answer or shed more light"
