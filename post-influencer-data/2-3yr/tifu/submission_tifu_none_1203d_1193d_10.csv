"TIFU by accidentally smacking my stepdaughter's ass


So, My wife and her daughter look remarkably alike same height same build, They get mistaken for sisters all the time, well It was a long busy day, and we were at home, and I came around the corner, and saw my wife standing there, and gave her a nice big playful smack on the ass, Only it wasn't my wife, they were both wearing extremely similar outfits. She just laughed it off but my wife is really pissed and hasn't really spoken to me since. I think I'll be on the couch for a bit. (resubmitted with the rest of the story, since I ended without the result it was removed)

Edit : The couch thing was a metaphor, kind of like being in the doghouse,   Im' not ACTUALLY sleeping on the couch,  We've since talked and she's cool with it,  knows it was an accident.   "
"TIFU by petting a kid because I thought he was a dog.


Edit: Here is a link to an update!

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4mao6x/tifu_update_tifu_by_petting_a_kid_because_i/

This is pretty weird so please bear with me.

I absolutely love dogs. I really do. I don't have one at the moment, but whenever I go for walks and see a dog I ask if I can pet it. I consider myself to be a good dog petter. I always ask the owner first, approach the dog slowly, and never push further if the owner/dog is uncomfortable. So. Here is the story:

My sister had a softball game, and I decided to go watch. It was out of town, so we had to book a hotel to stay with her. I didn't sleep very well and was kind of disoriented the rest of the day. They had two games today, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and they got absolutely creamed both times. During a lull in the second game, I spotted a small sandy dog with a nice looking couple. They were a bit off the side of the field, and I went up to them.

Me: ""Excuse me, but you have a lovely dog. May I pet it?""

Them: ""Sure no problem!""

I crouched and began petting the dog. I was maintaining eye contact with the couple while I was absentmindedly playing with the dog's hair, and I asked them what breed it was, where they got, what its name was, etc. Then the woman looked at the dog, looked at me, and gave me an incredibly spine chilling glare.

Her: ""Why are you petting my child?""

I looked down and looked closely at the dog for the first time. To my horror, I saw that I was petting a sandy-haired, kind of scruffy 4ish year old kid who, for this entire time, was crouched on the ground and drawing circles in the sand. The dog was right next to him.

I wanted the earth to open up and swallow me. I wanted to roll over and die. I wanted someone in a large black helicopter to fly over and drop a rope ladder and cart me off to Texas.

Me: ""OHMYGOD I am SO SO sorry I thought that that was your dog!""

Her: ""You thought MY CHILD was my DOG??!?!?! What is WRONG with you blah blah blah""

Kid: ""mom it's ok i didn't really mind""

Her: ""I mean the GALL to PET my SON I cannot BELIEVE JESUS CHRIST CHILDREN THESE DAYS""

I didn't really listen to the rest because I was internally screaming and that sort of drowned her out. I apologized profusely, but she still seemed upset. I later heard her complaining to the other moms on the softball team (her daughter is on my sister's team) who all seemed really confused.

tl;dr: Went to pet a dog, pet a kid instead, rage and shock ensues. I didn't even get to pet the real dog :c

"TIFU by sitting on the toilet too long


This just happened a couple of hours ago so I thought I'd share it with you all. 

I had just got home from work. I was about to start making dinner but I decided I need to go to the bathroom first. So i sat on the toilet and took out my phone to browse reddit. I was sitting there a good 10 minutes with my elbows cutting off the blood to the rest of my legs from me resting them on my thighs. 
I finish and go to stand up but there is no feeling in my lower legs at all. The second I am upright I topple straight into my shower door breaking it right off whilst also hitting my head off the side wall. 
So I'm sitting here with a cut on my forehead, a broken shower door and a girlfriend who has not stopped laughing since she got here an hour ago."
"TIFU by making a sarcastic comment in a chat window and ending up in a mental health facility.


So, let me start off by saying I understand that what happened to me was just a series of people trying to do their job. I have no ill thoughts, at least I think, towards anyone involved in my last three days.

It all started off with my application to my student loan provider, regarding the lowering of my student loan payments. They currently stand at a high amount ($250) and are scheduled to raise up to the $400's. Whatever, the system sucks, woe is me.

I opened a chat window with a customer representative, hoping to find a better option than $400 payments. The conversation ended with customer rep saying there was no better option. Me being a sarcastic person replied with something to the extent of, ""Going to school was the worst decision I've ever made and I'll probably end up killing myself. Byyyye!"" I closed the text chat, thinking nothing of it, and went and started the dishes.
Not more than twenty minutes later, the cops are at the door, I'm being cuffed and placed in the back of a cruiser.
I'm taken to a mental health facility, all under the assumption that I'll be assessed and then released in a matter of hours. 

Bad news. Turns out since I was brought in through the police, a three day evaluation must take place, in said mental health facility. I'm placed under suicide watch (for my entire stay) in the flight risk hall.

None of this really sinks in, until about 30 hours later and I still haven't talked to a psychiatrist, social worker, fucking even a nurse that knows what is happening. 

Countless things happened in that three day period that I still can't comprehend. Funny enough, if anyone has read [It's Kind of a Funny Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Kind_of_a_Funny_Story) or seen the movie, alot is relatable. I even passed the time drawing pictures and signing them for other patients. I attended all available groups, went to AA meetings, and did everything possible to be normal in hopes to leave after my three days. 
Even though I never experienced any suicidal thoughts, just poor judgement and a poor selection of words, I still felt as if I had to put on an act and jump through hoops to show I'm not suicidal.

I was released after three days, and sit here at my desk in a complete numbness of my experience. I honestly feel worse now that this happened. I missed work, feel like shit, and have an incredibly embarrassing story that will hover over me. Oh and an expensive psychiatrist appointment, not to mention whatever my three day vacation is going to end up costing.

TL;DR: Told someone online, sarcastically, that I was going to kill myself and was placed in a mental hospital for three days under suicide watch. Might have left with an actual mental disorder. Met some interesting people though.

EDIT: This post has been helpful with dealing with this experience. I hope some users have found a little comfort in seeing similar stories, I know I have. For a while after posting I attempted to reply to everyone but fell a little behind and will be turning off notifications. If anyone has pressing questions I'd be more than happy to communicate with private messages. Thanks again."
"TIFU because apparently we're not supposed to talk to transgender people.


**TL;DR: I said I could see myself hypothetically engaging in the act of love with someone who may or may not have been born a man.**

I swear I was just walking by.

I was coming out of the Produce department where I work when I was stopped by a freakin' *GORGEOUS* blonde by the deli case. She said that she didn't know what to pick out for her lunch, and did I have any suggestions? I pointed out some of my favorites; she thanked me and said that she appreciated how friendly everyone was there. I thanked her in turn for that and went on my way. 

That was *it.*

On my way back through that area later, Sheryl stopped me.

""Hey Kaser, we were watchin' you talk to that customer earlier. You sure were hitting it off, huh?""

""What? Oh, I don't know. She was nice. She was just asking for some recommendations for lunch. Why?""

""Sure were talking to them for a long time. I guess you didn't notice that was actually a *guy* then, huh?""

(...*she said, her voice rising in order to be heard by her partner in hateful shrewishness snickering over by the meat slicer.* Seriously: they *suck*.)

""What are you talking about?""

""That *'girl'* you like so much is a GUY. What, you didn't see the Adam's apple? Just wanted to let you know.""

(Full-disclosure: I had been having a bad day that day. I know I could have avoided all of this by simply walking away at this point, but TIFU because this is what happened instead:)

""Soooo, what you're saying is that I *shouldn't* have talked to her. You're saying that if a customer who I think might be transgender asks me a question I should ignore them and keep on walking. Am I reading this right, Sheryl?""

""Hey, I'm just trying to save you *some EMBARRASSMENT* (she practically shrieked, winking at Tweedledum over there (I'm serious: just the *worst* (see above)) the next time you get all flirty with a *transvestite* or whatever.""

(You know that part above when I said I was having a hard day? Yeah, so:)

""Okay, look. One, I wasn't 'flirting'. I was doing my *job.* Two, I don't feel embarrassed talking to transgender people. And three?""

I took a step closer so an old lady picking out radishes nearby didn't hear this.

""I really don't actually think that *was* a 'guy', for the record. But if it *was* a guy? And if I *was* 'flirting', because it somehow turned out I've been living a lie and *haven't* been married for eight years?""

""Guess what: I *TOTALLY* would have fucked that '*guy*'.""

Her face went fucking *green.*

""Um, you're *disgusting.*"" And she turned her back on me and lumbered away.

This morning the store manager called me into his office over reports that I ""was making inappropriate comments about customers on the sales floor"". I told him what I just told you. He said that he had to do a write-up of the incident for HR, but that if I was ""more careful"" about my comments in future he would consider the matter resolved. 

So yeah. Now some faceless drone in HR downtown has a report in front of them saying I need to be watched for making inappropriate comments about trans people. Awesome.

Fuckin' Sheryl, man.

Edit: The TLDR because I'm assuming that's why people are downvoting this so hard.

Edit2: lol, YUP, that was it. Ahh, Reddit. Never change. &lt;3"
"TIFU by dressing up as Bukkake


A little over a year ago my friend turned 18 which is the age where you can legally drink where I'm from and he decided to have an ""offensive-themed"" party. I decided that there's not much more offensive than semen so I decided to dress up as bukkake. Basically I just squirted shampoo all over my face which not only stung my eyes but it tasted awful. I was commited though as I reapplied it several times throughout the night. There was also a large fire which by the end of the night had way too much wood on it so it was pretty intense. It was a fairly cold night so I ended up spending the last hour or so around the fire.
One of two things happened then. Either the fire was slowly cooking the shampoo on my face or the shampoo had given me chemical burns bu basically the end result was my face was burned pretty bad.
TL;DR: I accidentally cooked my face with fake cum.

Edit: [There is a picture that somewhat hides my identity but still shows the shampoo for those that are interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4mc3r0/tifu_by_dressing_up_as_bukkake/d3ukalo)."
"TIFU by leaving the windows open


This actually happened today. 

So I live in a high rise apartment block. The aircon recently broke, so I was sleeping with the windows wide open for the past few days. 

As I woke up today, I walked over to the edge of the bed and reached for my phone and accidentally grabbed my Kindle which I was using the night before. It was heavier than my phone so my confused self was, well, confused. It slipped out of my hands and as I didn't have a morning coffee, my genius of a brain decided to kick it to bring it back up to me. 

You can guess the rest - a Kindle booted by my right foot through a window 33 floors up. 

Still haven't found it yet - GG


TL;DR: TIFU by drop-kicking my Kindle out of a window 33 stories up. 


EDIT: still haven't found it...may as well give up as I was gonna replace the kindle soon anyway.... :( "
"TIFU by getting scammed on Craigslist


TIFU by getting scammed out on Craigslist, here to get some of my pride back in sweet internet karma.

On the weekends, I have been buying and selling Xboxes and PS4s on Craigslist and my school’s yard sale groups. I know it sound a bit silly, but I’ve actually managed to make an extra $150-200 a week by buying them low and selling them high. It works. Well yesterday, I scheduled a time to meet this guy on the corner of my block to sell him an Xbox One still inside the box, he agrees to pay $275 for it. He stalled from 9pm to 10pm and said he “needed to get the money.” Eventually, around 10:20pm, he texts me saying that he is finally here.

I grabbed the console and ran downstairs to meet him. He came up the block in a red hoodie and counted the money out for me, mostly $10s and $20 bills. We had agreed to $275 but he actually counted out $290. I handed him the console and he was on his way. Yay for xGr4viity, right – nope. About 5 minutes later I was recounting the money and realized it felt a little weird and it wasn’t long before my entire apartment was crowding around my loss, comparing real money to the counterfeit bills that I got scammed with.

It was tough but I ended up cutting it all up and throwing it in the garbage. His Facebook profile turned out to be a really good fake, and his phone number was a burner – disconnected right after the trade. No cameras on my street either. So yeah that happened, there were multiple red flags that I should've caught. Fuck that dude.

EDIT: I dont post TIFU posts often. Can someone explain why so many people are commenting with anger at my fuck up? Its a subreddit for fuckups, hindsight is 20/20, I understand I was tricked - Id appreciate if you guys wouldnt comment with nonsense attacks

EDIT2: Holy shit this blew up. I find comfort in knowing that over 2,000 fellow redditors either learned from my mistake or got hard-ons telling me I deserved to get scammed for buying and selling a commodity. Thanks for the entertaining day r/TIFU

EDIT3: The money is cut up and gone. PLEASE stop telling me to give it to the police/secret service. I am not going to get my cash or xbox back and if giving the ""evidence"" to them would help prevent this sort of thing from happening, then it wouldnt have happened to me. Im putting this behind me.

"TIFU by lighting my ex's dog on fire...


My ex, and still good friend, and his little dog came to visit. Unlike my dog, he had yet to treat the Yorkie for fleas and ticks this season. Discovered a very large engorged tick on the poor little pup. 

Tried my standard go-to, ""suffocate the bugger in alcohol"" to make it release its bite so I could remove it head and all with a quick yank of the tweezers. 

Except, this time it didn't work. No problem, attempt alternative, burn it's butt with a lighter. 

Yes, I held a lighter to a fluffy little Yorkie drenched in highly flammable rubbing alcohol. According to my ex, who stood paralyzed, I put the ball of flames out in under 3 seconds with my bare hands (I think I have traumatic amnesia), and luckily the little guy got off with nothing more than a bad haircut.

Lesson learned: to remove a tick from a dog,  either A) light a match, put it OUT, and hold it to the butt of the tick on your non alcohol drenched dog (then yank the sucker; or, B) put a little squirt of your go-to flea and tick cream, wait a minute or two, and grab the sucker when he make a run for it.

PS I'm officially the owners I used to condemn from which I've previously rescued dogs. There's just no good context where you don't look like an asshole for lighting a dog on fire."
"TIFU by chemically scorching my testicles...


A few months back I started scratching my nuts a little more than usual.  It was a pleasantly cool spring so I couldn't in good conscious chalk my newfound genital irritation up to muggy weather, which sometimes heats up the underside of my saggy beanbag to the point where I've taken more than few ""timeouts"" from outdoor social gatherings to wipe the sweat away with a paper towel.  Ignoring the problem didn't help.  The itch only intensified, spreading to my butthole like hellfire.  One night I awoke to an itch so excruciating I was reduced to slathering my testicles and gooch in rubbing alcohol - going so far as to putting on a pair of fresh rubber gloves and fingering the remnants of alcohol up my pooper to calm the atrocious sphincter tingle.  Denial would no longer work...I did indeed have a raging case of jock itch.

The 24-hour Wal-Greens was twenty miles away.  Could I make it through the night without applying dedicated medication?  Would my half-ass home remedies work?  The re-emerging tickle in my genitals indicated not.

After purchasing fifty dollars worth of various ringworm, jock itch, anti-fungal sprays, powders and lotions, I immediately started spraying my junk with a gray, aerosol can of Lotrimin powder the second I got back into my car.  Goddamn this fucking itch!  The medication goes on wet then dries to a white film, enveloping my dick and balls with a soothing, wintery coat.  Ahhh...relief.  No, wait...FIRE!!! Jesus Fucking Baldheaded Christ!  What the fuck is happening to me?!  It felt like Lucifer himself was giving me a blazing handjob from hell.  Tears of pain instinctively streamed down my rufescent face.  I struggled to catch my breath.  A minute passed, then another, the searing agony slowly subsiding.  Oh, my poor boys, my precious danglers.  What have I done to you?

Once regaining my composure, masculine reasoning set in: ""Well, you certainly made it through that shitstorm of fury, old boy. The burn you were feeling was obviously the medicine doing its job - kicking that nasty, little fungus' ass. Now reapply!""

""Thank you, sir! May I have another?!"" my mind screamed while I hosed my itchy banana-beans down a second time, upon arriving home.

The same burning sensation nearly brought me to my knees.  Man, this stuff fuckin' works, yo!

Fast forward three days and I'm still blindly dousing my dick, balls, and choad in every goddam product I purchased that night.  That is until I actually took the time to observe my seething sex organs, and read the instructions on some of this medication.  What the fuck?! There's dried-out, leaky open wounds on my nuts!  That's *very* thin skin!  I can't afford to lose flesh there!

What the Christ?!  How did this happen?  And they *still* fuckin' itch!

Apparently, after emptying an entire can of Lotrimin before reading the directions, I realized I used a two week supply of anti-fungal medication in three days on my now blistering fuck-plums.  The itching sensation I was feeling was my poor scrotum meat trying to scab over,  attempting in vain to initiate the healing process, which was continually being thwarted by my brainless reapplications of fiery, death-spray and burning lotion.

I actually thought I might have to head to the emergency room once I showered off and took a good, full look at my crumpled cannoli and parched testicles; they looked like shit run over twice.

Panic-stricken, I started trying every fucking remedy I could think of to nurse my chemically mutilated genitals back to health, without letting my girlfriend know I had inadvertently destroyed them in the first place: dipping my balls in aloe vera after showering and letting them air dry, gingerly applying baby powder, doing hourly moisturizer touch-ups to the trouble areas.  My God, through the obvious lack of masturbation and constant caregiving I was bestowing upon my mangled junk, I'm surprised I didn't develop the Florence Nightingale effect for my own hairy enchilada and its matching sex-olives.

Word to the wise, read the instructions on jock itch medication or suffer the agonizing consequences of accidental genital mutilation.

Epilogue:

Two weeks later and my dick and balls are fine now.  They healed nicely, like it never happened, *and* my jock itch has also been defeated.  Further, and I'm very proud of this for some reason, my girlfriend never suspected a thing.  How's that for keeping my cool?  I genuinely thought my dick might fall off and I still didn't flinch.  Fuckin' A."
"TIFU by leaving my clothes unlocked while showering


So yesterday I was working out in my local gym like every other day, I prepared myself in the changing room, I locked up my stuff and made myself mentally ready for the hard work to come. Everything went well so the workout was great and I was satisfied with my work.


After I was finished with the day's pump I went back down to the changing room and I started preparing for the well-deserved shower. I opened the cabinet (you need to bring your own lock for it) and I started pulling out all my normal clothes just to make everything more convenient when I was done showering. so I basically left everything on a bench but my bag and phone which is still locked up in the cabinet. (Basically what I always do). This was my first fuck up. The second fuck up I did was leaving the keys hidden in my shoes which was also left on the bench. On top of that I even fucked up a third time. I somehow ended up packing a fucking face towel instead of a normal towel!


What happens next might not surprise you. After I managed to dry myself with this tiny towel that would only be fit for someone like Tyrion Lannister I went back to the bench and my cabinet. and guess what... My clothes, shoes and EVEN my sweaty and stinking underwear was gone!! my first 10 second reaction was like 'wtf is this, where's my shit?!' and suddenly I'm like 'did I just get robbed! and all I have left is this fucking face towel !!'... Yes, some low-life actually decided to steal my sweaty clothes AND my normal outfit AND my shoes and underwear... Imagine me, a guy who couldn't even bring this ridiculous small towel around his waist, asking strangers for fucking clothes to wear... 

For any wondering a really cool guy gave me some shorts and I can’t thank him enough for that! the way home was a little chilly though. I went by public transport.

TL;DR - my clothes got stolen while showering and the only thing I had left was a face towel. I got home with public transport wearing nothing but shorts.

Edits - grammar"
"TIFU by taking out the trash


This morning I noticed that the garbage can in the kitchen was overflowing and smelled like ass. I took it outside and went back to the kitchen to replace the bag. I reached in the cabinet under the sink to grab a new bag, and here is my fuck up. I do the thing you do with garbage bags to open them, but I feel all these specs like sand hit me in the face. I look down at my shirt and see I'm completely covered in millions of fucking satans evil spawn (fucking ants holding their fucking eggs). They're crawling all over my hair, all over my face, I'm screaming like a wild goat in heat, ripping off all my clothes. I open the front door and chuck satans concubine cave (the garabge bag box) outside and spray that shit with all the fucking raid I have in my house. My wife has been calling me Drama Queen all day, but she clearly doesn't understand the emotional pain of having ants crawl over your entire body while carrying their eggs.
