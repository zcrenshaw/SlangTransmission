"TIFU by getting my dad an ancestry DNA test for Father's Day and destroying his self identity


I know most non-Americans on here think Americans are idiots for how much stock we put in our ancestry, but the fact is that here in the US where heritage is celebrated and held up with pride, it becomes a large part of our self-identity.

My father's entire life he's been told he's 1/4 Native American (Seneca, to be exact) and that his grandmother was full blooded.  His parents taught him to take pride in that fact and his whole life he did.  He attended powwows, he read and learned about native culture, etc.  He even got a dream catcher and buffalo tattoo for his midlife crisis.

He's always been pretty into genealogy and has traced his father's side of our family back hundreds of years.  So, for Father's Day this year, I thought it would be fun to get him a 23andme ancestry DNA test.

We got the results back this morning and he's 0% Native American.  He's 40% Irish, 25% German, 10% Scandinavian and a quarter ""broadly northern European"".  He took one glance at the results, shook his head, went to his bedroom and shut the door.  A half hour later he came out yelling about how he should've gotten a shamrock tattoo instead.  I think it's going to take awhile for him to come to terms with it.

tl:dr-- My dad was told his whole life he was 1/4 Native American and made it a big part of his identity.  He's not NA at all and so my Father's Day present made him lose a huge part of his sense of self."

"TIFU by promising my daughter she could keep a seagull


Obligatory ""not actually today,"" but July 2016. I was on a beach vacation with my wife, 9yr old and 7 yr old daughters. The kids had been pestering me about getting a pet. In my infinite fatherly wisdom, I promised the girls they could ""have a seagull"" if they could catch it. Because, come on, that just ain't gonna happen.

Later in the week, I am lounging in my beach chair when...I shit you not... my oldest daughter nabs a seagull in a butterfly net. After many seconds of cheering from both daughters and confused gray and white flapping, I managed to collect my jaw off the sand. I ordered my daughter to let the bird go.

Both daughters were quite pissed off because it had taken them days to formulate and successfully execute their plan to acquire a pet. The story does have a happy ending. I did promise the girls a pet so we adopted a puppers. I have learned to never promise anything to the kids I can't deliver no matter how far fetched it seems. I've also learned to *never* underestimate the abilities of two young girls who have their heart set on a goal.

TL;DR I promised my daughters they could keep a beach seagull as long as they could catch it bc I knew it would never happen. Except that it did happen. I half-kept my promise by exchanging the seagull for a puppy.

"TIFU by ruining my school career


Can't sleep because of the stress from this and figured you guys should know. 
I'm posting on my phone so sorry for spelling errors.        
For my year 12 (final year) Media SAT (Melbourne, Australia) we are required to create a short film, for this our school lended me and two friends a tripod and camera between the three of us. We thought it would be a good idea to act in each other's films, but since the audio did not work on the school camera, I was forced to use my own Sony video cam. Anyways, yesterday went smoothly, my friend filmed his low-budget masterpiece and all seemed well. Then came today, my turn to film, pack my laptop to transfer files and my camera with spare batteries followed by a bus ride into the city. Great, finish filming, grab lunch and head home. This is where shit hits the fan. Now usually, I check all my bags before leaving public spaces, but his time I decide, hey, let's fumble finding my bus card,grab my tripod, forget to tap off and forget my backpack with my camera and laptop completely. I have rung the bus service and they can't locate the bus without the bus' ID code and I have to wait until morning to go to the bus depot and hope the driver kept an eye on the bag and handed it in after the last stop.
The laptop with my entire school career's notes, holiday homework and assignments will be gone if I can't find it tomorrow when the depot opens. I managed to sneak home without my parents asking, if I can't find it tomorrow then it's only a matter of time before they find out. Not to mention I have to film my friend's movie tomorrow. Pray for me.

TL;DR: Left my backpack on a bus, lost a laptop and camera. Now my entire school career may be in shambles, 1k of equipment lost, no backups and warranty has run out on my school laptop.

Edit: details 

Update: Went to the depot and got it back, everything still there. Apparently some guy nearly walked off with it but the driver saved my ass. Parents never found out, i'm the luckiest fucker alive.

Update 2: Thanks to all you guys for the support, made this whole ordeal a whole lot easier. 

Update 3: Seems to be a lot of confusion about how much this was worth. The SAT is worth about 30-45% of our marks for the year though im not sure. 50% is the exam and the rest is the planning leading up to this assignment which i'm not sure would be valid if I did not submit a finished product.

Final update: The reason I don't have a backup is that my notes are on an old onenote and I have had issues in the past accessing it after a windows 10 update. Definitely gonna backup my stuff now."
"TIFU by thinking a dead person was a raccoon


Welp, I goofed once again. This time, I was relaxing in my room after church was over. I went on Snapchat to check up on what my friends were doing, and I came across a post that said ""RIP Spencer."" I was confused, but I continued on, and on another person's story I saw a [picture of Spencer](http://imgur.com/eIM0NMx) that said ""RIP Spencer, you going to be missed buddy.""

My dumb self thought that Spencer was the raccoon and not the person. I decided to tag along with the ""joke"" and posted on my story saying ""RIP Spencer"" and giving my condolences. People were messaging me asking if I knew him and stuff, to which I replied no. Except for one person.

This person asked if I knew the person, to which I replied ""It's the raccoon."" She said ""No it's not."" I was extremely confused, so I did research. [Here's the conversation btw](http://imgur.com/xJki3qX)

I was mortified when I came to realize that Spencer was not the raccoon, but indeed the human that was holding the raccoon. At this point, my messages were being flooded and I couldn't do anything but apologize.

So yeah, I apologized and sent a prayer and that was it. Hopefully this doesn't stick with me very long...

TL;DR
Everyone was saying RIP Spencer, I saw a picture of said ""Spencer"" which I assumed was a raccoon. Posted about it and now have to apologize to everyone that I offended. Spencer was actually a 16 year old kid that was shot in a fight.

EDIT: Holy bohunkus! This blew up extremely fast! Ok, Here are several links to some news articles for clarification: [Article 1](http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/article160379264.html) , [Article 2](http://wbtw.com/2017/07/09/shooting-in-aynor-leaves-16-year-old-dead/) , [Article 3](http://wpde.com/news/local/teenager-shot-and-killed-in-aynor)

I'd like to clear a few things up while I'm here. First, the picture was NOT passed out by the family. A friend had this photo of Spencer saved and used it. Second, people asked why I joined in a joke I didn't understand. In high school, it's kind of something you do, but I understand that doesn't really justify my actions. Third, I apologized to everyone not because I did something wrong to them, but didn't want to seem like a messed up person and I just had my mistake. Thanks for your comments and feedback! RIP Inbox"

"TIFU by throwing up into a McDonald's bag while driving.


So last night I was spending time with my family to honor my late grandfather by drinking gin and tonics. Nothing too crazy or over the top, probably two G&amp;Ts and then a beer or two. For some reason it got me good though, and I was throwing up at my cousin's house all morning. I thought I had my vom sessions timed out perfectly and would be able to make it home in time without any disasters occurring on the drive home. So as soon as I yaked for the third time, I grabbed my stuff, ran out to my car, did some deep breathing and prayed to the G&amp;T gods that I'd make it home.

They heard my prayers and must have cackled, because five minutes down the road from my cousins I started to get that ""oh shit I'm about to throw up"" feeling in my mouth - you know the one. So I did the only thing I could do and grabbed a little brown paper McDonald's bag that was chilling in my passenger's seat from the night before and yakked my brains out into it while driving down a busy city street. Always keeping it classy. I put the vom bag down on the floor of my passenger's side and cranked my AC and hoped that was the end of it.

I was wrong. I got stuck in shore traffic coming over the bridge into NJ and caught a whiff of something foul (more likely than not it was my own puke) and got that trigger feeling again. I didn't know what to do so in my scrambled state of mind, I grabbed the McDonald's bag again. As I'm puking into it, the bottom of the bag gives out and its contents completely pour all over me. I spent the next 30 minutes of my drive home crying and sitting in my own vomit.

TL;DR I had to throw up while driving home, puked into the nearest container I had (McDonald's brown paper bag). Had to vom again, the bag broke all over my lap, and I spent a half hour crying while sitting in my own vomit."
"TIFU by letting a stranger check a new phone.


So, I work in a store where we sell phones and their equipments. And today, at 3 pm, a  crippled guy came to the store. He didn't say anything, he just came forward and started checking the phones we had. He started pointing at phones, and asking about the price and stuff, his way of speaking wasn't clear enought but I could understand what he was saying. He then asked me to hand him a phone name "" ARCHOS "", so I did.
Now, here is where shit started to get messed up without me realizing it. This phone has the bettery integrated with the phone, so he started turning it on. We usually keep the phones without a battery, cause people sometimes mess up stuff. But, I didn't want to hurt his feelings or anything, so I just went with it, and waited for him to check that phone. He then wanted to negotiate, but turned out he didn't have the enough money, he started asking about other phones...ect, then left. 
After he left, I wanted to turn the phone off again. To my surprise, the dude put a pattern lock to the phone. I didn't freak out much, cause i knew I can hard reset it, and ofc I was wrong. My man changed the language to chineese as well, and even the recovery mode is now in chinese and I can't find the "" reset option"" 

this is what the screen looks like 

http://imgur.com/a/bozzs

i would appreciate it if anyone tells me whicch one is that option. 

tl;dr I gave a dude a phone to check, he changed the language and put a pattern lock on it, and now I am ineed of translation


edit: It is allll fixed thanx to shay2k and also to anyone who tried to help . thank u guys.
edit2: this is my first tifu, and I forgot to edit the topic. For those kind people who suggest that I take a same model phone and just check the steps, then do the qame to the other, I couldn't. Because, that phone was the last one we had.

"TIFU by not moving my file onto dropbox.


So this happened 2 hours ago: I was doing my work at my uni for my assignment due Thursday - a 360 panoramic digital painting. I made great progress today and basically got most of the background work done, and even have some nice details drawn in - a really solid 6 hours of work.

I saved my file and logged off. Then I realised just now when I got home that I saved my file onto my school computer's desktop, which everything gets removed after I log out.

If there is a saving grace, it's that I am confident that I can replicate what I already did fairly quickly, but right now I am going through all the scenarios in which I might have a chance at recovering my 6 hours of work.

TL;DR: Saved my work in a temporary folder in my school server and lost my whole day of progress for a project due in less than 40 hours.

-

Edit: Done my work for today. Presentation in 6 hours. Didn't get to recover my original file.

Not a paid shill. If Dropbox wasn't a requirement from this course's professor I'd have settled for anything else just as well.

Not a fine arts major. Game design major. Apparently some people didn't know design requires drawing. Suggestion: start paying attention to real life. Literally everything man-made is designed, using drawings, to make pretty pictures, and habitable places.

Thanks to the people who are being sensible / logical / helpful. You guys are in the majority and you guys make this world a better place. As promised: [link](https://naietz.artstation.com/projects/LVVNA) to my finished artwork."
"TIFU by breaking my brand new $1000 phone with 1000 amps of electricity


Unlike most of the fuckups posted here, this happened 45 minutes ago.

To give you a little background, last weekend I took apart my old microwave and salvaged a 1000W transformer. For those that don't know, a microwaves transformer takes a low voltage, and increases it, decreasing the current. I modified mine so that it would decrease the voltage, and increases the current (amperage for Americans). So it turns 230v AC into about 1v with 1000amps.

I have been having a lot of fun with this because I can use it to instantly melt nails and other metal objects, creating a lot of sparks in the process.

Yesterday my new Samsung Galaxy S8+ arrived, it cost me about $1000, a phone renowned for its superb camera. So about 50 minutes ago now, I had the genius idea of filming me melting a nail in slow motion. How cool would that be? And what could go wrong?

So I set up my shiny new phone about 20cm (~8 inches) from the nail and melted it. Sparks flew everywhere, damn it looked awesome. That was until I looked at the back of my now not so shiny phone. The sparks were so hot that they had cracked the glass back of the phone, not limited to the camera lens and fingerprint reader, rendering them useless.

TL;DR
Cracked the entire back of my brand new phone including camera and fingerprint scanner by showering it in sparks.

Thank you for the gold kind stranger"
