"TIFU by not testing the stability of a grappling hook bought off amazon.


I tried to climb an abandoned factory at night across from my house. The grappling hook seemed to be fairly secure, and I started climbing up the rope thinking I'm spiderman. I am not spiderman. The whole thing falls apart when I'm about 15 ft up, I fall and sprain both my knees, cut up my arm and break my clavicle. I also needed a tetanus shot.

**Tl;dr** it's literally 5 sentences just read it

Now I don't have pictures of the actual X-ray, but I have the also much requested pictures of some of the injuries. The only proof I have of the knees are the braces which aren't that exciting.

And uh, here's a shameless plug of me doing the salmon ladder to show, uh, if I were to have a higher quality grappling hook it'd be possible. You know, if I wasn't a flaming idiot.

"TIFU by hitting on a girl and getting disowned


This literally unfolded over the last few hours

Every other year me, my siblings and my parents take a vacation together. It's a good way to bond since my siblings live in different countries and while i don't exactly agree with my family on many things we all love each other. Well. So I thought. 

It is necessary to point out I am a lesbian and my family are good people but conservative due to their culture (Georgia, the country not the state). Obviously I am closeted. 

We are currently in Europe on vacation and we went out for lunch. On a table across from us sits a girl who occasionally catches my eye and smiles or plays with her hair. That combined with her Ruby and Sapphire t-shirt makes me suspect she might be interested in me. The girl is also mind-numbingly hot, to the point I forget that gaying around in the presence of my family is not a good idea. 

So when we are leaving I find a moment and ask the waiter to pass her a note with my number saying ""didn't find the courage to walk up to you. Will you forgive me? ;) "" When we walk out of the restaurant I see her reading the note and smiling, SCORE!

We walk to the hotel and I realise my younger brother is not with us. I ask my Dad and he just laughs and says my brother asked to stay behind a little bit. 

Well it turned out my brother stayed behind to sit with the girl and ask her out. She turned him down and he was confused and mentioned how she was totally smiling at him all this time and she just fucking had to go and say ""No I was actually flirting with your sis. She gave me her number. Lulz."" WTF random European girl 

So my brother stomped up to the hotel and proceeded to tell everyone and we had a huge ass fight with my family and I was backed into the corner and with not much room to lie and suddenly I was fucking done worshipping Georgian ""family values"" (think a culture similar to Asian i guess) so I told my parents if they won't stop their bullshit and listen to me I was leaving bc I am 23 year old and not here to be yelled at and promised to be grounded. My mother looked me into the eye and told me ""if you leave you will never be a part of my family again"" and I snapped and said ""well fuck you you cruel bitch"" (not my proudest moment) grabbed my shit and left

So now I am sitting in a Starbucks and I am honestly kind of numb. I have my wallet, laptop, documents and other important stuff but most of my things are in the suitcase in the hotel room. I am so numb. I knew my parents would react badly if I were found out but I never thought they would disown me. Their unconditional love for me was always my bedrock. Also, I am slowly coming to realise that while I have a job back in Russia that can support me my parents' promise to fund my education in London where my brothers live is now probably moot so - goodbye chances to leave Russia

All because that girl was a stupidly hot blonde wow 

TL;DR: am gay, hit on a girl. brother also hits on a girl, she outs me to him. i get disowned. topkek 

UPD: had to relocate as my starbucks closed. Honestly overwhelmed at the amount of the support that I received in the meantime, thank you for your kind words and messages. I wish I could reply individually but that doesn't seem feasible, but I'll be gathering my life together. My older brother's blowing up my phone - not sure if he's doing it out of his own volition or my parents are using him as messenger so they don't have to compromise their pride. But I am not interested in talking at the moment either way"
"TIFU by ignoring a pimple


This fu didn't begin today but I'm still suffering the consequences so I think it counts.

Last fall I noticed a red dot on the side of my breast. It was the day before my first ever vacation to the beach and I had been planning the trip for a year. The dot seemed more painful than what one might expect from your run of the mill skin blemish. NOTHING was standing in the way of my vacation though so I finished packing and headed of on what wound up being a grand adventure with the exception of this annoying dot morphing into a major health problem.

Fast forward 8 days to the final day of vacay. Whilst shaking the sand out of my top I start to experience a pretty intense burning sensation. Take a peek and see that the dot has now become the size of a golf ball. Since I'm at this point a 10 hour drive from home I decide to wait until I get back to call the doc. 


Fast forward about 36 hours. My dr is on vacation and the fill in is booked. Pain is at this point severe and I'm running a fever. Haul my idiot self to the ER. The (male because that's my luck)nurse has a difficult time masking the look of horror on his face. He was very sympathetic though. I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter ""holy shit that has to hurt"" as he mercifully infused the morphine. 


12 hours later they wheel me into the OR. 4 hours and about 1/4 of my boob later I wake up in recovery. I wont describe the torture and excruciating pain that ensued over the next week as they assaulted my system with intense medications to fight the systemic infection coursing through my veins. I will say that it was on par with the emotional distress of waiting for the pathology report. Dr was fairly certain it was Inflammatory Breast Cancer. 
Path report was negative thankfully. The culprit? A single ruptured hair follicle. 

 
Two weeks after being discharged I was admitted again for surgery. It has been 6 months. It still hasn't healed. I'll require at least one more surgery before they can start the process of reconstructing the breast. All because I ignored a pimple. 


TL;DR  :  I ignored a tiny red pimple because I was leaving for vacation, had emergency surgery, lost half of my breast


edit: 1st- I meant absolutely no offense by my comment about the nurse being male. He was awesome!  the issue was all my own, I'm naturally very modest and it was embarrassing for me. He did a great job at putting me at ease. As much as possible given the circumstances. 


2nd- thank you everyone for sharing your stories.  I'm overwhelmed with trying to respond to all of the comments but it does help to know I'm not the only one. 


3rd- no pics. See edit #1. I have one pic post-op bandaged but I still keep it covered around my husband and disrobe with my back to the mirror.  "
"TIFU by dating a girl without knowing her name


I'll try to keep this short as possible, and maybe sorry for bad english.

That story happened 3 years ago. I was leaving a restaurant when I saw one girl in the street, she looked at me and I thought ""Well, I think I know her, I think I 'dated' her when I was very young (twelve years young, just holding hands and kid's stuff, I have 25 by now)"". So the girl comes at me and say:


Girl: Hi Diego! Long time no see.

Me: Hi! *Wtf, I don't remember her name*


So we chatted a little, remembering the old times at school and she said we should hang out someday. I thought why not, she was very pretty and could be fun, but she asked me to add her in the facebook, but I didn't remember her name, so I said:


Me: Oh, sure, how can I find you on Facebook?

Girl: Just search for my name, I think we have a lot of friends in common, it will be easy.


And thats I how I fucked up. I didn't want to ask her name, would be awkward because she remembered mine. So I asked for her phone, she gave the number to me and a I put on my cellphone as ""Girl I dated""

Ok, a week pass by, my friends wants to call her to know her name but I refuse, I had a plan and a backup plan, it would be easy. I call her, and the conversation goes like this:


Girl: Hello?

Me: Hi, who is this? (my plan! She will say her name and it will be ok)

Girl:... Diego?

Me: Hi!! Yes, how are you? (Ok, I fucked up)


So, she didn't say her name, but we chatted a little on the phone and I asked her out on a date. The date is set. We will see Iron Man 3 in the movie theater in the next day. Ok, my friends still wanting to call her, but I had another plan, we will see a movie, so when we get to the movie theater and we buy tickets she will probably have a Student ID (Idk if there is something like that in other countries, but college studants pay half the price in concerts and movie theaters in Brazil) and I will joke about her photo in the Student ID and see her name, easy peasy (I realize now that was stupid). 

So, we are on the movie theater ready to buy the tickets and I she didn't have student ID because she already have a degree, I fucked up again. I didn't knew her name yet but we went to see the movie. In the middle of the movie we start making out and things start to get hard, so we decided to leave and we went to my car.

I parked my car in a dark place and we start to make out and goes on and on and we had sex. It was very nice. After that she cuddles with me and we keep like that for a while. So, just to remember, I didn't talk with her so much, we just talk about us as kids, I knew nothing about her.

After a while she asked me why I didn't add her on facebook. Men... I froze. I start to panicking but I said that I didn't find her on Facebook, and the conversation goes like this:


Girl: You didn't found me? What you searched for?

Me: Well, I searched for your name, but I didn't found you.


She looked at me, her face turned into a very serious face. She asked me ""What is my name Diego?"". I almost shitted my pants, I didn't know what to do. Do I say the truth, that I really liked her and didn't want to be awkward and say that I forgot her name? Or I try to guess her name? (I really tought that her name was Bruna, but I tried to search on facebook and never found). I went with the truth. I said that I was ashame that I didn't remember her name, but I really liked the time we spent together, and she was nice and I keep going saying that stuff.

She obviously got mad and start yelling at me and saying a lot of stuff, calling me names. She asked me to take her to her home, and so I did. I stopped in the front of her house, and before she left I hold her arm and said: Please, Im sorry, what is your name?
She was very angry, she take of my arm from her, leave the car and says:


Fuck you.


And she leaves. Yes Reddit, Im very stupid. I was very upset for a few days, but after that I really laughed with that story.

TL;DR
Dated I girl that I knew when I was a kid, she remembers my name and I didn't remember hers. We had sex, she realizes that I don't remember her name and gets very angry. I dropped her at her house, ask her name and she says: Fuck you.


Edit: Guys, I didn't knew about the number-facebook thing, it was 3 years ago, and we didn't have whatsapp at that time.

"TIFU by switching seats on an airplane


Happened today, roughly 40 mins ago. Posting from the plane. 

 I am sitting in the aisle seat. 

Just got my drink from the flight attendant. They roll off to the next section. 

Lady in the other aisle seat, single mom, infant child. 

Has been talking about how hard this traveling is to see the father Etc etc etc...

She opens the child's bottle.

That was packaged on the ground. 

We are at 30,000 or more. 

It is pressurized. 

It leaps out, in an warm spray. 

Like the first gallon of water from a garden hose in the middle of the summer. 

Ankle, hip, elbow, drink, shoulder, ear canal, and hair. 

Drenched in warm milk. 

WARM... MILK... 

As my brain processes this the lady looks horrified. 

She immediately starts apologizing and producing napkins and baby wipes to assist in drying and sanitizing my self. 

All I could muster is ""don't worry about it""  

I knew that all I could do at this point is make her feel worse. But that wouldn't make me feel better or change my situation. 

I just have to ask her though. 

""Is that breast milk?""

Sheepishly she confirmed my worry. 

I have to follow up that awkward question with an important, personal medical question... ""Any thing I need to worry about? STDs, etc...""

She assures me that she is perfectly healthy and still so very sorry. Offers to buy me a shot on the plane. 

I tell her to please continue to not worry about it. I travel a lot. So much so that my favorite flights are the ones I can't remember. 

That this flight however. I will remember forever. 

I am dried off now. 

The flight attendant replaced my drink. 

The baby is fed and asleep. 

I am laughing about it in my head because, this isn't my assigned seat. I switched with a young lady that wanted to sit with her wife. 

Which reminds me, no good deed goes unpunished. 

**TL;DR:** switching seats to help a married-couple^lesbians sit next to each other put me in the firing line of roughly half a baby bottle of recently harvested female breast milk, which i briefly thought could make me patient zero for ghona-sypha-herpa-aids.

**EDIT**

clearing up frequently asked questions.

**bottle pressure:**
the altitude at DFW airport is 607 feet. The altitude a cabin is pressurized to is 8000 feet. the pressure is sealed in the bottle, and escapes rapidly into the low pressure around it, hence spraying all over me. *This experiment covers the basics of how this happened* http://www.physicscentral.com/experiment/physicsathome/physicsonplane.cfm 

**STDs how stupid are you!?!?!?:**
Today I Learned... CDC says its fine for Hep B and Hep C moms to breast feed. Transmission is less than 1%-2% and the nipples have to be cracked and bleeding http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/hepatitis.htm

**what did it taste like**
I didn't get any in my mouth, it was just so shocking. not that there is anything wrong with breastmilk and if my wife and i have kids, i'll probably try it in a controlled environment. 

**Was she Cambodian:**
you're funny and you should go into comedy.

**was she hot**
I honestly couldn't tell you, I didn't notice her before the incident, and could look her in the eye after the incident. I'm happily married and just don't care what other women look like."
"TIFU by getting nervous after deciding to try to ask a waitress out.


So this happened about 30 minutes ago, throw away because my friends know my original account and they can never find out.


So, I decided to eat at my favorite restaurant for lunch. It was my favorite restaurant not only because of the awesome food (especially when hung over or drunk), but also because of a particular waitress. We'll call her M. This waitress and I had been flirty for about a year or so, she would take breaks when I came in to talk, or take a smoke break next to me, or just random conversations while she worked. She always worked the same shift, and often times if I went in at the end of it, she would have a quick bite to eat with me, or I would walk her to her car as I was leaving. M was actually really cute, a rare thing for a restaurant like this, and though she was about 5 years younger, I couldn't help but be attracted to her. I decided today when I went to the restaurant, I was just going to take the risk and ask her out.


Fast forward to me going to the restaurant for the first time in a few months because I'd been away for work. I went near the end of M's shift so that I wouldn't be asking her out in front of her coworkers or staff, as much out of respect for her as it was I didn't want to be embarrassed if she said no. Of course M comes over and says hi, and we talk for a bit, then she has to get back to work because they're starting to have a rush. Well, a bit later, another regular comes in, an older man that everyone enjoys talking to. This particular man was a bit slow, so the staff shows a bit of extra care and patience with him so that he feels welcome there.


Well, the older customer is joking with everyone, and trying to decide where he wants to sit, and M decides to be helpful. She asks him if there was a certain waitress he preferred, and told him who was working what section. Well, she ends with ""and this is my section, do you want me?""


The fuck up: As soon as I heard that, for whatever fucking reason, my body decided this would be the perfect time to tell her how I felt, so without even consulting my brain, my mouth blurted out ""Hell yes"" very loudly. Loudly enough for about half the restaurant to hear. 


The reactions were immediate. The cook burst into uncontrollable laughter, the older waitresses gave me dirty and disgusted looks, and a few of the customers were politely trying to hold back their laughter, and one almost spit out his drink. Mercifully, M was behind my table at this point, so I didn't see her reaction, but since instead of asking her out I had suddenly turned the situation into a horrible sexual innuendo, I can't imagine it was a positive one. Thankfully, I had cash on me for once so I threw down a $20 and left with my head down and without looking back. I guess on the bright side she got a little over $9 for a tip? Looking back though, I really wish I would've at least apologized before leaving.


TL;DR: Went to a restaurant with the intent of asking out a waitress I'd been acquaintances with for about a year, ended up making a horrible sexual innuendo in front of the entire staff and customers. 


Edit: To everyone telling me to go up there ASAP, I will be going up there in the morning, hopefully fairly early, but before lunch. I'll be sure to keep you guys updated, thanks for all the support!


Edit 2: Well guys, I did it. Just got back from the restaurant, and things went... Ok-ish? I woke up, showered, put on a decently nice button up shirt, made the drive over to the restaurant, and drove right past it.


Yep, nerves got the best of me again, but after 2 or 3 minutes I managed to convince myself to turn around. Got to the restaurant, went inside and sat at my usual spot. Different cook today, thank God, he's a good guy and would have probably made a few friendly jokes about it, but that was one conversation I didn't wanna have until after I had spoken to M. Anyways, M came out and said hi, took my order as usual and basically acted like the entire prior events hadn't happened. I asked her to join me on a smoke break, where I apologized for what happened. She laughed about it and said it was fine, and that she had heard a lot worse. I finally built up the courage to ask her out for coffee (weirdly, I don't even drink coffee, but I couldn't think of anything else), but sadly, she declined. Apparently she's going out of state tomorrow for a vacation before she starts grad school in a couple of weeks. She did give me her number though, and said that we should get together when she gets back! Not exactly the ending I was hoping for, but I figure I've waited this long, another week won't kill me. Now I just need to figure out if the 3 day rule applies here since we've been flirting for so long...

Edit 3: final update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4ygjhz/tifu_update_by_getting_nervous_when_trying_to_ask/)"
"TIFU By wasting 16 years of my life by cheating in school by being misdiagnosed with ADHD.


For as long as I can remember, when I was 8 years old I've had horrible issues with sleep in general. I was *always* tired during the day and evening no matter what was done. I could sleep 6 hours or 12, absolutely no difference.

At the time, none of my doctors could figure out what was wrong with me. They had assumed because I wasn't fat, and I was so young that it simply was ADHD. So I was given Adderall to mask the symptoms of sleep, which did help. 

I don't know if you guys know what massive sleep deprivation does, but imagine having no sex drive and being tired all the time. Anytime you try to study, you get unbearable sleep attacks that even if you did fight it, it was moot because you literally forgot what you just read.

My sleep deprivation was so bad, I had to constantly rock my head against the desk just to stay awake. My teachers were always frustrated with this, and would frequently think I was sleeping and ask me questions. Amazingly enough, I was able to answer these questions and not get in trouble.

Eventually, my parents got scared that I wasn't getting proper education and took me into home schooling. This was literally the worst decision in my life to agree to. They were unbearably strict, I had to get a 80% or I was grounded and had to take the lessons over again.

It was impossible for me! I tried so hard, but no matter how much I tried it didn't matter. I would be literally fighting myself to stay awake, and forget the last 30 seconds of my life. I didn't know what was wrong with me!

I did the only thing I could, and that was cheat. This is my biggest regret in my entire life, I had cheated through ninth grade to 12th, hardcore. I installed a virtual machine, which for some reason Windows 7 gave admin rights inside of it even if you were a standard user. I had copied the answers from the Teacher edition.

Eventually, the guilt overwhelmed me and I admitted this to my parents. They were not happy at all and made it much harder for me. I then had to use a keylogger to steal the password and grade the courses myself.

I felt so guilty, I had graduated high school by cheating and as far as everyone is concerned, I have no better education than a 7th grader. I no absolutely no math at all, I even struggle with addition and subtraction. I became very depressed, and was given anti-depressants which didn't work at all. I did make a recovery from depression however, but it was during dark times. I didn't realize I was gay until right around this time, and it kind of hit me all at once. But it was a huge weight lifted when I got out of the closet, as if I was suppressing my own feelings without realizing it.


So at this point, I did the only thing I could do. I started studying in computers, as much as I could. I got the shittiest help desk job and moved up the ladder and make decent money, but currently feel I have hit the glass ceiling. I opened up to my friends here and many of them felt that my medication for ADHD was ""cheating"" and that being tired is perfectly normal. This hurt me the most because these co-workers were the closest thing to me other than my parents and they totally disregarded my problems as something normal and I was taking the easy way out.


I felt no doctor could figure out what was wrong with me so I literally diagnosed myself, I did research online and with the symptoms I had and blood test results I knew I had the conditions. 

I tested positive for Narcolepsy, which involves taking 5 naps with 2 hour breaks in-between. I fell asleep on 4 out 5 of them, hitting REM within 6 minutes.

I was rated at 48-72 hours of constant sleep deprivation. My entire life, I was misdiagnosed as having ADHD.  To make this even worse, I also had sleep apnea despite not being overweight. I inherited the sleep apnea, from my mother and narcolepsy from my father.

It was an overwhelming experience, everything made sense. I no longer feel stupid and understand why I had so many problems.

But in return I feel my entire life has been wasted and I am not sure what to do. I had cheated through High School, skipped college and only went into IT knowing that it didn't require an education. I had played life the best I can with the cards dealt.

But now knowing this can be treated and I can go to college, I am scared. Part of me regrets not being more resilient to my parents by complaining I needed help, but they never believed I had issues as I had good hyper-focus. I was writing scripts in games at age 9, so they felt I was more than smart enough to handle it.

Perhaps my calling is to become a doctor myself, but having no education and starting from High School just not sure if it's possible.  

I know I can't blame my parents, they couldn't have known. There's nothing I can do to change the past, but hopefully my story can help support others who have similar issues with staying awake and feel trapped. TIFU isn't for getting advice, it's for letting people know you fucked up... and I did. 

Tomorrow is a new life for me.


TLDR: I had massive sleep deprivation from both Narcolepsy and Sleep Apnea, misdiagnosed as ADHD and given Adderall. It was impossible for me to function, my family had too much high standards that I had to cheat and I ended up here today knowing how to fix this problem and feel I wasted 16 years of my life,  not knowing what my future is. 

My entire life all of my friends called me lazy for admitting taking Adderall, explaining I couldn't stay awake. Constantly being told why don't I try being a normal person and not take drugs as ADHD is a load of crap. Being tired was normal, etc.

"TIFU by having sex with two transvestites in the Philippines and becoming their captive.


This happened in 2013.
I was 19 and experiencing the first week or two of drinking alcohol in my life. I was on a street called Burgos Street, that is known for it's pay for hire activities. However, I was actually there to visit a cute waitress at a bar that I met at a nightclub. (The waitress was not a sex worker nor a dude by the way). It was late so I left the bar to get a taxi. They were usually abundant but I couldn't find a cab so I decided to walk around the block. A random girl asked if I wanted a massage. She said it was about $15 USD and I was like sure, correctly assuming a sexual encounter would occur. (I was there to visit the waitress girl on friendly terms, but I really wanted sex and didn't think I could get it otherwise). She holds my hand and begins to lead me to a hotel. On the way back to the hotel, another girl asks if she can join so I was thinking ""awesome!"". I had never done any of this before but thought the massage would be somewhat sexual. They led me in the room and had me shower. By this time, I was realllly excited.  

For some reason, something in my mind clicked and I realized these girls might actually be men. I began to notice their voices sounded more like men pretending to be women. By this point, I was too excited and drunk so I told them that I knew they were men and that I wanted to play anyways. They stripped down and I took turns playing with both of them. Afterwards, I showered again and they asked for payment. I was thinking it'd be like $30 still, and they were like, ""the (pesos equivalent) was for a massage. Sex costs more."" At this time, I was like, oh shit. They wanted $75 each. I told them I don't have that much money and they said that they could take me to their manager. At this point, I'm like, I really messed up. I want to avoid meeting the ""manager"" so I tell them I'll go to a certain ATM and that my debit card only works with ""B.O.A"", never completely saying Bank of America. Over the course of an two hours, we drive in a taxi from mall to mall in search of the non existent B.O.A. ATM's. They are getting frustrated and telling me that I should just ask my stepbrother for the money back at the hotel. (I may have mentioned that I was on a family vacation while inside some ladyboy....)       
  
During the mall visits, I'm pondering whether I can run away from the guys and escape their sight. At another instance, we're waiting for a hotel and I was considering hopping a fence and booking it. Anyways, at the final taxi I would take that night, I get in the taxi and quickly lock the door. The driver of the taxi, being polite, unlocks it for the other guys. I let out a quick ""NO!"" and the taxi driver knows he made a mistake. The guys get in and we drive around for a while, stopping to ponder our decision. Taxi driver knows whats up. He locks all but one of the interior doors of the cab. I get in and lock it. I say ""here's $20 bucks, get me to my hotel."" The guys get in another taxi and begin following me. Eventually, my driver loses the other vehicle and brings me to my hotel. He asks, ""Don't they know what hotel you're at?"". Fortunately, although I originally told my actual hotel in the early chaos, they forgot it and I named a new hotel that was away from mine. I mentioned the random hotel's name several times to reinforce in them that that was my hotel. Perhaps they ordered their taxi driver to head to my decoy hotel. During the drive back to the hotel, my driver couldn't stop laughing at my situation...  
    
 I've never told anyone this because it's so embarrassing... 
I was so worried I was going to get injured by their ""manager"" or have to reveal to family that I needed money to pay 2 angry ladyboys. I also wonder if they got in trouble for not collecting payment and being out of service for 2 hours chasing money....

TL;DR: Thought I was paying $30 for sex with 2 cute girls, wound up captive for hours for my $150 sex fee with 2 guys."
"TIFU by trying to ask a girl out and then breaking her skull.


This just happened like 3 hours ago.

I was at a wedding and was bored to no end. I was standing outside the wedding hall because it had rained earlier and the weather was very pleasant. I see this girl about the same age as me, i actually kind of knew her. I grew up in a very conservative area and only now I had moved to a more ( you could say) liberal area. Because of this, I have no idea, on how to ask a girl etc, and I just clamp up in front of girls. But this was the day, i thought to myself that this is the day that everything changes.

I start thinking on how to intiate conversation, what to say etc. I make up a great plan on how I will ""accidentally"" bump into her and apologize and start talking about how boring the wedding is and how one thing will lead to another. You can probably guess what happened next.

She is still standing there. I start walking after her and try to bump her. But the pavement was slppery and she was wearing heels. I bump her, she slips and falls on her head. I just froze for a minute. There was blood everywhee. I start shouting for someone to help us(we were like just outside of the marquee). A group of people come near us and someone calls an ambulance. I hold her head. I feel so bad.

This girl was the younger sister of my sister's friend. I have never felt so bad in my life. By this time, 80% of the people inside of the marquee were outside including her sister. The ambulance came and they picked her up and her sister also got in the ambulance with tears in her eyes. I felt so bad. I want to visit her in the hospital tomorrow as my sister is going tomorrow to visit her but I feel like an all round douche and I don't know if I should go.

TL;DR: Tried to intiate conversation with girl by ""accidentally"" bumping into her. Pavement was wet, she slipped and broke her head.

Edit: I have commented here before, but the thing is that she was taken to a military hospital(it was the nearest). Her father is in the military and hence doesn't have to pay for anything.(I don't know if military hospitals cover children of officers but here they do). I am going tomorrow with flowers and chocolates. Wish me Luck Reddit!"
"TIFU and deciding to go to sleep in a car and almost dying


When I was about 15-16(couple years ago) I stayed with my sister a lot. Their house was disgusting(the type where nobody ever cleaned anything ever) and I was fed up with sleeping in a house that nasty, so I decided to go sleep in their big ass van, which was slightly less nasty. Well I was stupid and didn't realize that it would be really hot the next day. I woke up in what had to have been 100+ degree weather, my vision was so blurry I could barely see, I could barely lift my hand to open the car door, I was drenched in sweat. Stumbled inside after a minute, told everyone what happened, they looked at me like I was stupid, and I was. It was the middle of summer, I don't know why I thought it would be okay to sleep there. Worst part is that my sister has kids and they would have been devastated if I accidentally died in their car.


I literally JUST realized while I was writing this that all of my near death experiences(I have a few) have been directly and clearly caused by my own stupidity and not just bad luck or accident. Damn. "
"TIFU by popping a spider bite.


Wolf spiders are pretty common where I'm from in the Midwest, so getting spider bites wasn't an unusual thing growing up. A couple years ago, I noticed that one of my tattoos on my leg had a big bump with two little dots on it that was pretty painful, so naturally I popped it and thought nothing of it, and went about my day. The next day when I woke up to catch a flight, I had a fever and the entire back of my leg was swollen and red and I could barely put weight on it without it hurting. I go in to the E.R., and the doctors were unsure if the initial bite or an infection caused the swelling and fever, but she said she needed to cut open my leg, drain it, and pack it with gauze. I asked if this could be avoided and her literal response was ""Either we cut open your tattoo now, or we cut off your leg later."" Got the surgery, was given Keflex and sent on my way. Little did I know that I was PRETTTTTYYYY PRETTTYYYY PRETTY allergic to Keflex. When I would take it during the day, I would become groggy and  experience mild hallucinations along with the most exhausting fatigue i've ever felt in my life, and during the night I would wake up to chest pains and both my arms being completely numb. It wasn't until about a week later that I finally called my mom and complained about what the side effects were and she told me I was allergic and to stop taking it and I'm lucky I didn't die. Fuck spiders.

TL;DR I got bit by a spider got an infection in my leg then almost died from taking antibiotics I was allergic to.

EDIT: My mom did not know I was allergic to Keflex, she simply put two and two together (and later verified with a call to the doctor) that I was having an allergic reaction based on what I told her. I had never used Keflex before, just a few other antibiotics.

EDIT 2: Ok I get it, the odds of it actually having been a spider or insect bite are slim to none. I said that the doctor thought it was an ingrown hair but noticed the ""puncture wounds"" so said it may be a bite. I didn't like spiders before this, and i still don't now.

EDIT 3: A harsher reaction to Keflex does not necessarily constitute an allergy, got it. Still going to mention it at the doctor since I reacted that way. "
"TIFU by filling my hotel bathroom with bubbles


So, boyfriend and I are on vacation; sightseeing, having a great time. Including a pretty posh hotel room; king sized bed, room service, modern, and a jet tub in the bathroom.

Now, as we are here to relax, we decided that our evening should include a bubble bath in said giant tub. In preparation we go to LUSH, ask for bubbles, pick out some bubble bars and we're set!

Neither of us have used bubble bars before. Boyfriend asks me how much to use and I figure one and a half should give us the Hollywood bubbles I've dreamed of, so he throws them in, runs the bath, and we start the jets.

We're dancing in the living room, waiting for the bath to run and cool. Boyfriend periodically checks on the state of the bubble bath and is increasingly concerned about the amount of bubbles.

Now it's relevant to point out that the jacuzzi tub is older and operates through one, variably reliable button, so we tried to stop the jets over the next half hour, but instead prolonged their cycle... 

As the suds threatened to escape the tub area we tried to hold them back with the shower curtain. At this point we figure it's best to just let the jets run their course, since we haven't figured out how to turn them off. So we close the door go to living room and continue dancing for the rest of the hour.

When our playlist ends, we decided we should probably see the state of the bathroom. We peek in to discover a scene right out of a sitcom. Our bathroom is entirely full of bubbles. The shower curtain had put up a good fight, but eventually the suds were too much for it; filling the rest of the bathroom and spilling out into our hotel room once the door was opened.

Resourcefulness on our part won out; we threw on our swimwear, used towels to scoop as many bubbles as possible back into the tub area, and got the floors and walls mopped up before any lasting damage occurred from our personal foam party. Best Fuck up of my life!

Update:
We'll post pictures when we get back to the hotel. None of the pictures show the whole amount because once the entire room was full we immediately started cleaning it up. 

Update 2: 
Here are the pics that were promised!

"TIFU by washing my daughter's toy.


Last night I decided to wash my daughter's old Precious Places castle. She hasn't played with it in a few years, but wants to keep it anyway. I got out a washcloth to clean it off, but I decided to be smart and put it in the shower. I turned on the water, poured dish soap on it, and ket various residue and detritus flow off of it and down the drain. I walked away to let it keep rinsing off, and then saw the flashing lights playing erratically on the wall and remembered that this thing has batteries and plays music when you perform certain actions. Crap. I pulled it out of the shower, but the damage was done. I left it upside down to drain, and figured she can still keep it... it just won't play music anymore. I transferred it to the bedroom when it was dry enough, and forgot about it. At 1 am, I woke up to what I was certain was an angry, screeching, flashing ghost. The music was playing, slowly and drawn out, and the lights were flashing haphazardly. It took me way too long to figure out what was going on. I checked every electronic device in the room before I found the castle shoved under the shelf where I had left it. I took it to the bathroom and slammed the door, but the sound followed me back to bed, so I had to get back up to wrest the batteries out of the thing. After pulling out the toolbox and finding the correct screwdriver, I noticed the off switch. I never knew that castle had an off switch. Upshot of this whole event is that I am now really, really, tired after having been woken up by a demonic pink castle and been unable to go back to sleep for hours."
