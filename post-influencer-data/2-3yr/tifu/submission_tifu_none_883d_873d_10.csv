"TIFU by underestimating apple cider vinegar


This occurred within the past 24 hours and could be subtitled, Adventures in Health: a Cautionary Tale

So I've had Apple Cider Vinegar on the edge of my radar for awhile, but never looked into it very deeply. My wife recently picked up a bottle of it to help with some gastric issues my son was having, but only used a teaspoon or so out of it so it was just sitting on the kitchen counter.

Flash forward to a little while ago when I was closing up the house for bed and noticed it. I need to give that a try I mused, then hopped on my phone and did a quick search on recommended methods. Yadda, yadda, so many parts per ounces of water... add a pinch and dash of so and so...in the words of Sweet Brown, ""Ain't nobody got time for that."" So I grabbed a Dixie cup and poured two fingers. 

Not being a total fool, I took a preparatory sip and although it had a bite, it didn't seem too bad. I did the next logical thing that people who never read directions fully tend to do...pinched my nose and tipped that sucker back. At first, I just got a little bit of the Holy Ghost and did the shimmy shakes, but they passed after a few seconds and I felt okay aside from the extremely pungent aftertaste.

Hey, you remember those science fair volcanos you used to make in elementary school that you fill with baking soda and food coloring, then at the last possible second, douse with a cup of vinegar before running for cover as the bubbling ooze endlessly pours from the top?  That's a really useful metaphor for my story because my baking soda stomach decided that it didn't appreciate an apple cider vinegar bath and, well, I'll spare you the details except to say that the leftover pizza I ate for lunch then wished that I hadn't was no longer an issue for my digestive system. Unfortunately, the myriad of snacks and tonight's dinner was blocking its path down the mountain, but the geyser of apple cider vinegar erupting up my esophagus convinced everything else in my stomach that life would be better down the metaphorical mountain too.

The edges of my vision went dark and I saw a tunnel of light which I doggy paddled along the ether to reach, which transported me to a place made of light. A figure approached out of the mist and I immediately recognized him as Jesus. He knelt and gently took me by the hand and slapped the back of my head and said, ""What were you thinking?"" Then everything started to fade.

I became acutely aware of the smell of sulphur and a rising burning sensation in my body, but as my vision cleared I realized that I hadn't indeed been catapulted into the lower reaches of Heck (reserved for the headstrong and hasty), but I was just feeling the after effect of my stomach's sudden rebellion. I'm currently able to walk again, although my stomach is a bit jumpy and the back of my throats feels like it's been run over a cheese grater.

If you have enjoyed this story up until now, I urge you to keep your eyes peeled for my soon to be released bestseller, ""Better Bulimia Through Apple Cider Vinegar."" It promises to be a hard hitting read.

TL;DR Threw back a shot of apple cider vinegar; chaos ensued."

"TIFU by sneaking a spaghetti sandwich into the movie theater


Last week, my friend said he wanted to see Rogue One and asked if I would come along. Star Wars isn't really my thing, but I might as well go cuz I have nothing else to do. I'm a hungry guy, so I tried to figure out what I'd sneak in. I decide that candy wouldn't be enough, it was time to try something new. My mom made spaghetti the night before, and it's my favorite food. So, I put some in a plastic bag as well as two pieces of bread in another bag. My friend doesn't notice, and we finally get into the theater. The lights go down and [POSSIBLE SPOILERS] the blind guy fight scene begins. I whip out the food and start eating it. A security guard comes by and sees me. Eating a spaghetti sandwich. He says ""Sir, you can't bring outside food into the theater."" I say, ""I didn't. I bought this at the front stand."" He says, ""I'll go check, if it's not there, your movie is over."" As soon as the guard leaves, I bolt to the door at the back of the theater room. It didn't say emergency exit or anything on it, so when an alarm screeched, it scared the crap out of me. The sandwich was still in my hand, so I took a bite and all the people flood out of the theater. When the police arrive, I have to explain that I was eating a spaghetti sandwich and set off the alarm because I panicked and tried to leave. I'm formally banned from the theater, and my friend got banned for a week for ""being an accomplice.""

TL;DR: I snuck food into the theater, when a guard saw, I ran out the emergency exit by accident, and I'm banned from the theater now."

"TIFU by hiding ""fuck"" in my school yearbook


&gt;Obligatory ""not actually today""

About one-third of the way through my 8th grade year, I, being in the yearbook class was having a good time interviewing others and writing things for pages. One day, my friend, (Frank, to keep anonymity) was assigned the Robotics Club page. Frank isn't the best at writing conventionally, so he came to me to see if his main body paragraph looked OK. 
&gt;01010001010110! Welcome to Robotics Club, where you can...

&gt;etc.

I notice the string of binary code at the beginning and ask him if it means something.
&gt;no, I just mashed my keyboard with ones and zeros.

I then suggest to frank that it actually says something.

I show him an ASCII to binary converter website and he is a little bit confused on how to use it. So, I show him how to use the website, trying different words and numbers. He says
&gt;How about we make it say ""hello?""

The smartass inside of me thought it was a good Idea to have it say something else, so I put the funniest thing a new eighth grader could think of. I type ""fuck"" into the generator while he isn't looking then quickly use inspect element to change ""fuck"" in the input field to ""hello"". Thinking that nobody would ever notice, I left it alone and just assumed he caught on and changed it.

Fast-Forward to about three-quarters through the year, book is done and has been sent to publisher. I had forgotten about this series of events, and Frank had put it into the yearbook. One day, Frank is called down to the main office. Our yearbook teacher gives the entire class a lecture on what is and isn't acceptable in the book. The next day, I get called in. Frank told the principal that I wrote the binary, and that he legit thought it said ""hello"". 

I was booted from that class, and my name removed from the bylines. I had to confess my mistake in front of the entire Yearbook class, and basically spent my 6th period in the counselor's office for the rest of the year.

**TL;DR**  Friend wanted some binary code for his yearbook page, I put fuck instead of hello, had to apologize and spent rest of year with counselor."
"Tifu by going paintballing with out telling my wife.


So this happened around a month ago but we are still realising the enormity of this FU. 

This FU starts with me going on a business trip for a week a month ago. I had finished my work a day early and my flight couldn't be moved my boss said the I could use that day to do what I liked as I had work late into the night the past 3 days. So I looked on the website 'meetup' for things to do and found a group going paintballing. ðŸ˜ƒ I join and have a brilliant 7 hours accumulating many bruises. 

After a 7 hour flight and an hour drive I get home late morning to find my wife getting ready to leave for a week due to a last minute conference. There was less than 15 mins between me getting home and her leaving so no time to really talk.

Now here's were the FU ramps up. 

On the day that my wife is due home I go for a morning run what I didn't know was my wife had returned home seconds after I had left and had seen me leaving. Half way round I started to feel bad but tried to push through the pain. Moments later I fainted and hit the ground. My wife who knew my route had thrown on some slacks and followed me only see me on the ground. An ambulance was called and off to hospital we went.

After an initial assessment they asked my wife what all the bruising was from and she had no clue. Apparently this is a red flag for domestic abuse. It took two hours until I was coherent enough for me to clarify that I went paintballing all the while my wife was being asked by many people why i was bruised. My wife and the nurse was suprised by my statement and I don't think the nurse believed me. 

After 40 hours in hospital I was released and home we went. Two days later we had a PCSO vist because of loud shouting in our apartment building. And finally this morning we woke to find our apartment had been broken into and trashed. We have just moved and had nothing value outside our bedroom how we didn't hear them we don't know. The problem is that when we called the police they split me and my wife and interrogated us. Asking me questions about our relationship. 

After all these encounters we think that the powers that be think my wife beats me. 

Tldr:- went paintballing didn't tell wife series of events and now people think my wife beats me."
"TIFU by switching on a lamp and sneezing


I was working in the lab a few hours ago using a UVA lamp (basically a black light) which is a rather dim light source that essentially leaves me working in the dark. Once I'd finished up with the lamp, I sat at my desk and completely blinded myself by switching on the regular and much brighter desk lamp.

Fun Fact about OP; having a bright light shone in my eyes makes me sneeze.

Repeatedly. 

Like 11 or 12 times in a row (current record is 17). It's particularly bad after spending a few hours in the dark.

So I sneeze.

Hard.

And smash my face off the desk

Which doesn't stop the sneezing; didn't even slow it down really. Instead it busted my nose open. 

I tried to cover my nose with my hands and get to the toilets while still sneezing but that basically made things worse. A dozen or so sneezes later and my little corner of the lab looks like a Jackson Pollock painting, there's a small trail of blood all the way to the toilets, bloody hand marks on the lab doors and I look like an extra from the Walking Dead.

**TL;DR: Switching on a lamp made me sneeze so hard I smacked my head off a desk, busted my nose open and sprayed my workplace with blood**

Edit: Fucked up Mr. Pollock's first name."
"TIFU by smoking weed at a police station


I'm telling this story because 4/20. It actually happened 13 years ago.

I was in college, a few buddies and me went to go watch Shrek 2 in the local theater.  Beforehand, we decided to find a secluded place to toke up.  It was late on a Saturday and we found what appeared to be an abandoned building.  We pulled around back, packed a bowl in our trusty piece ""Reese"", and started smoking.  As the pipe made its third round, we saw a car driving up behind us.  We all slunk back in our seats to avoid being seen.  The car parked right next to us; it was a police car.  We were totally silent.  We saw two cops get out, talk for a minute and then walk away.  We laughed at our bad luck and then got ready to leave.  Just then, another police car pulled up on the other side of our car and two more officers got out.  When they were out of view, we left as quickly as we could.  As we pulled out, sure enough, we dumbasses had just lit up behind a goddamn police station.  We took a picture of ourselves with pipe in hand and the police station in the background and sent it to a couple friends to boast of our accomplishment.

We went, saw Shrek 2, laughed our asses off, then went back to the dorms at our college.  When we got there, our dean had somehow intercepted the picture of us smoking.  We got suspended, but it was much better than being arrested.

Anyway, enjoy 420!  Be smarter than me, smoke anywhere but a police station.

tl;dr me and my buddies got high at a police station; got suspended from school because we boasted about it.

edit to answer a few recurring questions: we're not 100% sure how the Dean got the picture, we think someone uploaded it to our school's student network and some third party brought it to the Dean's attention.  No, he doesn't look like the Dean from Community, he looks more like Dennis Haysbert.  Yes, my school suspended me for something that petty.  It's a small, religious college (2,000 people) and it suspended people even for legal activities, like smoking cigarettes or consensual sex.  Also, Shrek 2 is underrated, get high and watch it this weekend.

second edit: thanks for the gold, **FUCK DONALD TRUMP**"
"TIFU by trying to walk on a numb foot


Scenario: I wake up with 30 mins till I have to leave for work. I can't feel or move my left foot. It is completely limp. Well, I have to get ready for work and I don't have time to wait for feeling to come back. Barely conscious me thinks, ""No problem! It will be like walking on a peg leg. Feeling will come back while I get ready.""


I stand up.


That lasts for half a second as my ankle rolls and I fall to the ground. Hard.


Shit.


I pick myself up off the ground along with my shattered dignity. I hold my left leg in my hands and shake it until feeling returns. Too bad that with feeling comes an incredible amount of pain from my newly sprained foot.


Double shit.


I limp around the house, taking twice as usual. I end up being late for work and missed an interview for a supervisor position. Basically fucked up my entire day and my foot.


TL;DR Thought a limp foot would work like a peg leg, sprained it and missed a job interview."
"TIFU by trying to clean a lamp


This didn't happen today but happened when I was 9 years old. My dad is a neat freak so as a child I picked up the habit (Which I grew out of). When anything was a bit dirty in my room, I cleaned it up. So one day, as any 9yo does, I'm at my tiny desk coloring, and I notice there's dust on the lightbulb (which is very much on). So I rush into the bathroom, get some toilet paper and wet it in the bathroom sink. I rush back in to my room, and try to clean the lamp. As I put the wet toilet paper on the lightbulb, it explodes, with the glass that broke, leaving cuts on my hand in a couple of places. So I'm sitting there crying and my mother hears me from her room. She comes in, and sees my hand bleeding. As she's panicking, she asks me what happened. I told her, and her panic turned into laughter, at how stupid her son is. Because everyone knows that water and electricity don't go well together. The cuts were nothing a band aid can't cover.

TL;DR: tried to clean a lightbulb with wet toilet paper, which ended up exploding and making my hand bleed.

Edit: Grammar mistakes.

Edit2: as a lot of people pointed out it was the water with hot bulb that caused the ""explosion"", so I feel stupid. Can someone scientifically explain why that happens, please?

Edit3: also lots of you expected to see a genie in this story, I'm sorry that isn't the case. Maybe in my next TIFU? Haha

Edit4: so many similar stories! Glad I wasn't the only one! And lots of people have answered 'Edit2' in the comments so thank you!"
"TIFU by reporting myself for theft


Obligatory this happened several years ago.

I was out drinking with some uni mates on a bit of an informal reunion. We'd been out a fair while when we went to a bar that used to be a student favourite but had over time become a locals' pub popular with the residents of a nearby council housing estate. Most of the guys didn't really fit in, with their skinny jeans and fancy shirts. I've always been a scruffbag so I didn't stand out too much.

After one drink (my round by the way), everyone decided they wanted to get out of there and try another bar so we left quite quickly. About 10 metres out the door I realised I'd left my leather jacket behind. When I went back in to grab it, someone was picking it up off the seat it was on. I said ""Oi, that's mine"" and he apologised saying he thought it was his because it looked similar. I slipped it on and caught up with my mates.

At the next bar we didn't stay long enough to get back to my round. And we headed to a club. I Agreed to pay the lads way in instead of a round but when we got to the door I found I didn't have my wallet.

Obviously the guy going through my jacket in the Court Inn must have nicked it. This club was on the same road as the police station so I said to the lads that I was going to report it stolen and then I'd catch up with them in a bit. I went to the police station and there were about 4 policemen in the car park so I called one of them over and told him the tale. When they asked for a description of the guy I gave it.

Here's where I should have thought harder. He had hair about the same length and colour as me, beard about the same length as mine. He had eyes the same colour as me. He was about my height. He was wearing a t-shirt about the same colour as mine, Jeans like I was. And he'd said he had a leather jacket like mine so I told them he might be wearing a leather jacket. I told them all this, and that he was at the court, gave them my phone number and left.

Since the court inn wasn't far and would be close to kicking out time I thought it would be a good idea if I went back and confronted the guy. So as I was wandering back I wanted to text the guys to let them know what was going on. I couldn't find my phone. I was confused by this because I thought I remembered checking it in the queue for the club. Turns out the inside pocket of my leather jacket had a tear in the lining. As I'm almost at the pub I find my phone, my wallet and an old work ID in the lining of my jacket.

Relieved I turn around to head back to the club right as two police officers are stepping out of a car behind me. I walk towards them thinking I'll tell them I reported a crime and that I wanted to cancel the report. They came over and said they were investigating a theft and I suspect I wasn't very clear in my explanation because when I said something like ""no, I've got the wallet back"" they asked to see it. Saw it had my ID in it. Saw I matched the description of the thief and started arresting me. I don't think it helped that on my driving licence I had no beard and at this point I had quite a full beard.
 
When they got me back to the station they had my phone and rang it to try and get in touch with me. When it rang they thought I must have taken that as well. I tried to explain that I was me and I was mistaken when I said my wallet was stolen but I was nervous, drunk and rambling so they didn't really get it. But they did say if it was my phone, could I unlock it. I was shaking nervous and drunk and I got my pin wrong three times and that was that. They processed me and tossed me in a cell overnight.

In the morning, a sober me was easily able to explain that I was me and that this was all a big misunderstanding and in the clear light of day they could see that I matched my ID and I was let go with a warning about wasting police time and filing false police reports.

TL;DR Thought I'd had my wallet nicked. Gave the police a detailed description of myself for the thief. Realised I had my wallet and the police arrested me for having the stolen item and matching the description of the thief."
