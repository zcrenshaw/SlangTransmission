"TIFU by pranking the wife. NSFW


This happened a couple of months ago. 

Kids were all on sleep overs. We finally had a weekend to ourselves. Having decided we would enjoy the peacefulness. A all out steak dinner was in the works. Cooking together making our own favourite sides. Asparagus for myself roasted potatoes for her and buttered mix veggies to share. 

Sometime during dinner conversation, we end up taking about urinating practices. She states men are gross and pee everywhere. My rebuttal is that it's not as easy as she thinks. 

Fast forward to the morning. I challenge her to try to get all the pee into the bowl, without any splatter. Challenge accepted. 

So there we are. Myself standing at the toilet, wife holding  my junk aiming. I can't let her win. 

I start slow, using some kegal action to control the flow. She's getting the hang of this, so I up the flow a little to throw her off her game. At this point the asparagus pee odor reaches her face and she doesn't want to do this anymore. 

This is where the fuck up starts. Up to this point she has been doing very well. I am losing and that can't happen. As Deadpool would say I chanted in my head ""MAXIMUM EFFORT"".  I squeeze my cheeks, close my eyes and kegal the crap out of my bladder. 

I can hear that the stream is no longer hitting water. Her first reaction is to turn off the flow manually. Squeezing and bending is her technique. I open my eyes in pain and try to step back. She counters by trying to get a better grip with her free hand. 

At this point things are happening in slow motion. Fear has set in, I try to dodge the income hand, but get tripped up by my boxers wrapped around my ankles. The hand is coming and I'm losing balance. I shifted just enough that she would miss, but take a direct hit to the coin purse. 

I'm falling back as she releases the death grip. Ending up in the tub with my legs in the air. The built up pressure is released, spraying myself in the face. 

TL;DR

Tried to win a childish argument. Ended up slightly concussed, Bangkoked and waterboarding myself with asparagus pee."
"TIFU by shaving my anus NSFW


Had to create an account just to tell you guys this story!

Though it was several days ago that I shaved my asshole, it is this morning that I had to face the consequences.

My girlfriend and I decided to shave our sexy parts together earlier this week, so we did. I shaved my pubic hair down to the skin. Like a baby's bottom. For some reason, I thought my asshole looked a little messy, so I went to clean it up a little bit. The more I shaved, the cleaner it looked, so I just clipped the surrounding hairs down very close to the skin.

A couple days later, I'm at work and my asshole is irritated. I thought nothing of it and I continued my day. It wasn't severely painful.

Then it became severely painful the next morning. I took a look at what's going on down there and I have some ingrown hairs that look like little red mountains of pain and grossness.

This morning, I took my throbbing asshole to the immediate care center, where the doctor had to correct ten ingrown hairs right on the area I can only describe as the ""taint."" I was laying on my back with my legs in the air, feeling the sensation of having my taint pierced nearly a dozen times.

I feel better now, but I will never shave my asshole again."
"TIFU by going on a date with married woman and finding myself in a shitty situation NSFW


Foreword - This happened over a month ago. The night it happened I knew I would submit the story to this subreddit, but due to the embarrassing nature of the content I opted to wait an unspecified period of time before posting. 
 
I am a single man living in a city in the US. I was raised incredibly religious and recently, already far into adulthood, I have begun to experiment with the mischievous pleasures I have up to this point avoided. My life is currently an oddly connected string of misadventures. Not the least of which happened on the night I fucked up. 
 
One such taboo I have explored is sex with married women. For those unaware, there is a robust online community comprised of couples in open relationships looking to explore sex outside of their partnership. I have dipped my toe into these waters many times with generally positive results. But after the events of this night, I fear I may never again. 
 
I had been talking to Jane (fake name) via text messages for a few weeks until all parties felt comfortable engaging. We decided to meet at a restaurant attached to my apartment building. Dinner was nice and we connected immediately. She’s a beautiful woman a few years older than me. She married young, has at least one child and an understanding husband. The only real mistake at dinner was opting for a second, free bottle of wine that came as part of a previously unknown 2 for 1 deal. We opened it thinking we would have a sip or two, but finished it far too quickly. 
 
After dinner we changed into swimwear and went up to a large ornate hot tub on the roof of my apartment complex. The wine kicked in and we were feeling its romance. There was chemistry. We kissed. Soon we were ready to be alone. 
 
In my apartment we turned the music on and the lights off. She removed her wet swimsuit in a strip-tease performance. All clothes came easily off and we started to have sex on my couch. 
 
ENTER THE FIRST PHYSICAL ODDITY – Jane is a squirter, meaning upon sexual stimulation up to and including orgasm, Jane lets forth warm gushed bursts of liquid from her vagina. I’ve been with squirters before, but the shear volume and frequency of Jane’s squirting was truly remarkable. After a few strong pulses that showed no signs of letting up, I suggested we move to the floor. At that point she assumed the top position and we continued. Moments later the floor was covered in female ejaculate. 
 
ENTER THE SECOND PHYSICAL ODDITY – After an especially intense orgasm Jane’s body became erect and her face showed a state of shock. She ran to the bathroom. It was then I realized the smell. It was a terrible and familiar smell. My wine-drunk brain frantically scattered through its olfactory libraries to determine the culprit, afraid to look down where Jane had straddled. But in the end I couldn’t will away reality, and when all evidence was too strong to refute I began to accept that I’d been shit on. 
 
Said mess was spinning afloat a small sea of gushed love left spreading inch-wise across my apartment floor. 
 
I started to clean the mess with a half dozen towels (that have since been burned). Jane called out from the shower, demanding I join her. At this point in my mind our little rendezvous had ended and this was the solemn hygienic dénouement. But this only lasted a moment. 
 
Her hands washing me and her face and the steam and the wine all played partner, and as shameful as it may seem, we continued our sexual experiment starting again in the shower but shortly later moving to my bed. 
 
Though I had apparently forgiven the earlier mishap, I had not forgotten. I laid down a series of towels in strategic locations and positioned our bodies to have sex on the bed’s edge so that the physics of our planet coupled with the angle of her asshole would form a natural path towards one of many towel traps. The sex continued. I could feel another strong orgasm build inside of Jane and peak. She paused, motionless. The suspense was palpable. Had it happened again? Up until this moment all admission of fault had be implicit. Until, that is, in a moment of introspection she conceded: 
 
‘I keep excreting.’ 
 
I was a bundle of emotions. On one hand, I had been shit on a second time. On the other hand, my shit-trapping towel mathematics had succeeded! In many ways I felt like the sexually deviant De Vinci of this wayward shit-fearing generation. 
 
The pride of accomplishment carried me a second time into the shower. This time we both had a silent understanding that there would be no third shitting. 
 
We finished our shower. I walked her out. I bleached the apartment and I have never spoken of the incident. Until today....
 
TLDR; During sex, a married woman squirted and then shit on me. We showered and continued and I was shit on again. 

EDIT: Thanks for all of the interest/funny comments/and Reddit gold! 

A few questions and comments I've gotten multiple times in the comments section or in PMs 

COMMENT - 'She did it on purpose!'

Reply - That's quite possible. I guess I'd put this at a 5% chance for the following reasons: 
1. There are tons of guys that would be into this. Of course, one could devilishly advocate 'But yeah, the surprise would be part of the fetish' to which I'd have no strong reply. 
2. She seemed genuinely embarrassed. 
3. When she started squirting (or urinating) she told me she was a squirter. She didn't have the same reaction with the other. 


COMMENT - 'Maybe she had a physical issue, she opened up to you, maybe don't make her feel bad about it' 

REPLY - You're absolutely right. I tried to make her feel as at ease as possible about the oddity of the situation. If she or her husband are reading this, I believe I've made the details vague enough to never affect you. And thanks for the story and (mostly) fun night! 

QUESTION - What are these online communities of which you speak?!?

ANSWER - First of all, by community I don't mean a single site that serves this purpose alone. In fact, I've lived in a few states in the past few years and it seems like each area has its own site(s)/ groups that everyone uses. In one state there was literally a private yahoo group dedicated to this. I was invited based on an OKCupid interaction. Long story short, once you find a way into the community (regular dating sites, google 'swinger events in city, polyamory in city, etc) then the path will become clear. This interaction started on OKCupid. 

QUESTION - How could you sleep with married woman?!?

ANSWER - I see no issue with it when it involves consent from all parties involved with set boundaries. 

I actually received a number of fairly scathing super-religious sermons on marriage. Thanks for the thought, but I feel more peaceful and at ease with myself now than I ever did when I was religious. 

I'll try to respond to each message sometime this week. I didn't plan for so much action on this post, but it's certainly a pleasant surprise! Thanks again!

"TIFU by not asking if a woman was in a relationship.


     This one actually happened last night!

I'll start with some background. This woman and I have been dating for about 2 months now yet I have never seen her residence. After a week of me pestering her she finally says yes, tells me to come over after work. We get off at 2 in the morning which made me assume I would be staying the night, bought a bottle of booze to help the night along. 

This is where the FU starts. I pull up to the address she gave me and park a house away as per her request, it is a very nice house way out of the price range of what we make. Seeing this I assume she still lives with her parents which isn't to odd for a person in their low 20's (we both are), explains why she didn't want me over. Right? After a very fun night of drinking and watching movies she leads me into a bedroom that looks like my grandparents, no color, a nightstand with pill bottles and a real alarm clock on it. Didn't think to much about it, big mistake. After doing the deed and being rather drunk we pass out. Waking up to her phone alarm going off and her yelling ""OH SHIT OH SHIT HIDE NOW"" I get shuffled into a closet, NAKED!

..... Been hiding for a while between a wall of clothes and damn GUN SAFE. I am trying to decide if I should yell ""Leroy Jenkiiiiins!"" or ""no one expects the Spanish inquisition!"" to start my naked dash to my clothes and then freedom, then comes an older sounding voice and the sounds of love making shortly after.... 'Oh shit her parents are home!' I think to myself, now my options are trying to sneak out or doing the respectable thing and introducing my naked self as their daughters boyfriend. I make the safe choice and sit there for what seems like hours. Eventually the door opens and my girlfriend is standing there signaling me to be quiet and come out. I lunge from my throne of old shoes and face plant hard, my legs have never been more asleep. I hear a voice from bed saying ""babe what is going on"" and then i see a 60+ y/o general manager from a different shift sit up and stare into my naked soul. All hell breaks loose and I sprint towards the door eating shit on the wall outside as my legs are apparently in a coma, hearing a thud behind me I pick myself up and run for my life not knowing if he is going for me or the gun safe. I make it outside with only a bloody nose and a few sore spots that I blame my traitorous legs for.

Now here I am outside naked, bloody, no phone and no keys. I hide a few houses down for about 30 minutes. My little soldier is trying to make a full retreat into my body for warmth and my fingers are bright red. Sneaking to my car I jump in the back with only a winter hat from the floor of the car and the fetal position to keep me warm. After a few hellish hours of thinking death was at the door my now ex-girlfriend opens the door and tosses me my stuff and says get out quick. I floor it out and find a spot to get dressed and check my phone, 5% battery and 20 minutes to get to work... great. 
I get to work and keep my head low until the shift before me finishes leaving, not knowing if the GM knew me or not. A 10 hour shift with no sleep was ahead of me. I eventually get to talk to the woman and the first words out of her mouth are 'please don't be mad it's not like you asked if I had a boyfriend'....

TL;DR Didn't ask a woman if she had a sugar daddy before getting romantically involved.

edit for this https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/43xufv/how_do_you_make_a_new_paragraph_when_typing_on/

UPDATE: So I talked to her on my first break and she is acting like nothing happened which blows my mind. I made it clear that we are done and she didn't handle it well but oh well. Also I will be getting myself tested! Depending on the results their may another TIFU on the way but much darker lol "

"TIFU by being trapped in a train


So this is actually happening right now while I'm writting this... 
So lets rewind a few hours back to how I got where I am right now *rewind scratch sound*

It's Monday and I have a ton of work to do for school (different papers to write) and I just didn't have the time to finish all of that work during the weekend so I decided to skip classes today and study. Now I don't really like to study at home bc I easily get distracted or I just give myself every 10' a food break wich I ofc well deserve after watching 10' of YouTube videos bc You can't study while you eat right? So my favorite place to study is on a train; now I need to mention here that I live in Switzerland and our public transport is more than amazing (srlsy it's so good you get annoyed by it at some point). So why do I prefer to study on a train? Well you get a comfortable seat, a lil table to put your laptop and papers, a plug to charge your devices, it is very calm and you can have some of those *glancing out of the train window while thinking about deep things of the universe*, oh and you can enjoy a beautiful view of the snow covered Alps. But most importantly I can't get distracted, you see when you get on a train only with your school stuff you don't have anything else to do apart of studying those books. I forgot to mention that I own some special train card (GA) that allows me to hop on every train, ship, bus, cablecar of switzerland, so i don't need to buy a ticket for my favorite study place. 

So usually I go to the mainstation, hop on some random train and start studying until I arrive to the endstation between 1 and 4hrs later. Once at the final trainstation the train *usually* goes back to the mainstation or to another city. So I spend my day zig-zaging aroun Switzerland studying.

Now comes my fuck up...
Like every other time I hoped on a train and started studying... 2hours later I arrive at the final train station, everyone else gets off I continue to work very focused on my paper waiting for the train to leave the station again, either to anew city or back to where I came from. After some minutes you always hear a message thru the speakers wich asks everyone kindly to leave the train *in four languages bc switzerland* (I know this message by heart now in all of the languages). I always ignore it still waiting for the train to leave the station. So the train finally leaves and I continue studying. Now after some minutes I realize that the train isn't going along the usual tracks (after years of doing this I start to know wich tracks go where by heart). A bit confused but not alerted I keep studying. Now the train comes to a stop, I guess we arrived at the next station, after around 10' I look out of the window and that's the moment I realize I fucked up: The train is in the middle of a huuuge/massive/enourmous field of sidetracks where the train company parks their trains and cargos. Before I can even think of something smart to do the lights go off, my phone stops charging and I guess they disconnected the train from the grid. 

So now I'm looking for a solution... I could open the train doors with an emergency lever, but every swiss person knows; you shouldn't except the train is like literally on fire, why you may ask? bc. if they argue that it was not an emergency you need to be able to pay a fine that is around 3000US Dollars. *I am not able*. Also not all of the tracks I see seem to be sidetracks, every 30'' there is some high speed train rushing thru this field, everytime on a different track but impossible to see wich ones. If I would get out of the train I would need to run over this field of tracks avoiding trains going at full speed randomly changing tracks. 

So here I am now sitting writting this TIFU wondering if I should start making myself comfortable for a night or if I might get out of here.

tl;dr I got on a train to study, ignored the please leave the train message, now trapped in a train surrounded by high speed trains rushing around my wagon wich is parked on a sidetrack.


**UPDATE**
So unfortunately my phone battery died shortly after I posted this. Before anything else: I made it out! 
*How*
So while my phone was dead and I my laptop still had some battery I decided to work on my paper until my laptop dies, or something changes in my situation... I mean I was not in danger or anything as long as I stayed inside. So while I was focused on my paper someone knocked on the window: two track workers in yellow neon clothes. Immediately I start screaming thru the thick window glass to communicate. I understand that they are from the German Train Company and that they need to get a guy from te Swiss Train Company, *So I guess I am at GER/CH border*... after 5' they both return with a swiss track worker *and a german border police officer* Yeah I amost shit my pants realizing that I might be in so deep in shit that I should get my diving equipment... the swiss track worker opens the train door with some special key and instantly the police officer asks me if I am a swiss or european union citizen (fyi bc of the migrants crisis they r a bit more sensible lately). Being both (CH and EU) citizen I say _both_ he doesn't think it's funny, I show him awkwardly my swiss ID card he notes down my name and number. They then kindly bring me to the closest train station being in Germany, on the way I ask the police officer if I will get a fine, he says that I didn't break any law so it is up to the swiss train company. So here I am now back in a train, but this time heading home wondering if the swiss train company might ban me for life.... 

**Edit** 
Some people mentioned that I could have charger my phone on my Laptop, I must clarify that I'm using an iPad with keyboard... and I use it as a laptop... but at the same time it isn't having no USB port... *also people wondering that why I didn't have a charger or why the train didn't have an outlet.... there was an outlet and I had charger but I was charging my iPad instead of my phone... as soon as the fuck up began I mentioned that the train was ""turned off"" aka. taken off the grid so there was no electricity*"

"TIFU by getting into a random car and thinking it was my Lyft.


This actually happened 2 days ago....

I was heading out to attend a basketball game and called for a Lyft to get to the arena. I saw that my Lyft had arrived and I saw it was a white SUV. I walked out of my apartment building and saw a white SUV parked right out in front. I did not think twice and proceeded to get into the car. I moved over whatever was on the seat (leftover food?) and he began to drive without saying a word. I thought it was a little strange, but did not think too much of it. I then got a notification that I was charged a $5 cancellation fee from Lyft, hmmmm ok, now this is weird. I came to notice we were going the wrong way too, so I asked the driver, ""hey, you're going to ***** arena, right?"" This was the first time he turned around and said anything. He looked me in the eyes and said, ""oh shit, you're not Peter!"" He then proceeded to get very upset (I don't know why) and he unlocked his doors and screamed, ""get the fuck out of my car!"". I was in shock and was also a little scared, so, I was left out in the middle of an unfamiliar part of the city, and I ended up missing half of the game. (But I did get into the correct Lyft this time)

Moral of the story: Make sure you are actually getting into your Lyft when you think you are getting into your Lyft.

TL;DR thought I was getting into my Lyft, but it was actually a man who thought I was ""Peter"", missed half of the game

"TIFU by not having renter's insurance


So of course this wasn't today but back in April of this year. I was robbed while I was at work one day. It sucked. They got two TV's, my Nintendo Wii U &amp; 3DS, my iMac desktop computer, and a few other things. I filed a police report, gave them the serial numbers I had, checked with local pawn shops, etc. After a month or so went by I pretty much gave up hope. The detective that was keeping me updated didn't seem to have much to go on.




I checked into renter's insurance so I'd be covered if something like that ever happened again. Bottom line, it's way too cheap not to have. If you're a renter and you don't have either a home security system or renter's insurance, I would seriously consider at least one of the two. 




I'm posting this to share my experience and hopefully encourage someone to avoid this. With that in mind, I learned something else from all this and thought I would share that as well. Kind of a silver lining to the story if you'd like to hear it. 




One day about two months after I was robbed I was sitting at home and a friend sent me a message. He said ""Dude, your Wii U is online right now. Says someone is watching Netflix."" So then I realized.. whoever ended up with my Wii U hadn't factory reset it. He sent me a picture of his TV and sure enough, there I was.. online watching Netflix. Suddenly I had hope again. I wasn't sure how, but maybe I could get a lead from this.




I started to call Nintendo support but it was outside their business hours. Then I decided to log into my Netflix account just to see what I could see. That's when I learned Netflix has a log you can easily check that shows each time a device accesses your account. It also lists the device, and best of all, the IP address the device was using. Bingo.



I used a public network tools website to ping the IP address. It showed that it was a Bellsouth (AT&amp;T) internet subscriber. I then contacted the detective. I sent him screenshots from my Netflix account showing the IP address and the timestamps, along with the ping results showing the domain. I also sent him the steps to contacting Netflix and AT&amp;T for law enforcement assistance. He thanked me for the information and said he would get right on it. 



About three weeks later I got a phone call from the detective. ""I wanted to let you know I've got your Wii U."" I had nearly given up again by this point so this really made my day. Turns out the person who stole it gave it to a relative. That relative let their five-year-old kid play with the Wii U. Thanks to him watching Netflix I got the console back in one piece.




Unfortunately that's the only good news I have. They tried tracking down the named relative, who I was told already had a criminal record. They ""tried to make contact with him"" on three occasions but were led to believe he was tipped off and got out of dodge. I haven't heard anything since.




If I'd had renter's insurance I could have simply replaced all the items that were stolen. Instead I lost a couple thousand bucks worth of stuff and now I have to go without or come out of pocket to replace everything. Getting my Wii U back was a damn fine consolation prize though.




TL;DR - If you rent, get renter's insurance. Write down all the serial numbers on your expensive electronic devices. If you get robbed, see what information you can find to help the police recover your stuff.




Edit 1: Wow, thanks for the gold! 


Edit 2: Renters insurance, not renter's insurance. I can't change it and it bothers me."
"TIFU by falling back to sleep with my boyfriends dick still inside me. nsfw


Boyfriend woke up, stuck it in from behind while we're laying on the bed,  finished the morning deed after about 10 minutes. Commence fuck up. We had stayed up all night doing exactly this and we were still very tired. We fell asleep as we were. Wake up 2 hours later in the same exact position. I start moving and feeling some discomfort.  The boyfriend wakes up hurting as well. We try to pull apart only to realize that our love juices are dried up and pulling his hairs... I'm currently writing this not wanting to move anymore and cause any more pain to my bf.. halp! How do we get out of this without ripping all his pubes?!?"
"TIFU by using my dishwasher to unclog my sink


This fuck up just happened, but started about two weeks ago when I bought a bag of small orangie citrus fruit (tangerines?). As a single guy, I've been trying to sneak more fruits/vegetables into my diet.  Anyway, the orangies were delicious but there were 20 or so in the bag and me just living alone found it hard to finish them off - which leads to my fuck up.

While putting away groceries last night, it looked like the orangies were ready to go to the trash. There were about 8 left - slightly spongy and questionable. I briefly considered tossing them in the trash, but then I figured they'd do better off going down the garbage disposal in my sink.

The disposal ate the first orangie with no complaint, so I fed it the rest one by one with the water running. No problems. But then.... the water started to slowly creep up and I knew I was deep in fuck up territory. I tried a plunger - no effect.

I went to bed with about 8 inches of water in the sink. When I woke up this morning, the sink was empty leading me to believe that I didn't have a *complete* clog and I just need force to blow the clog through the pipes.

I realized my dishwasher discharges through same pipes as the sink and garbage disposal, so I turned it on and blocked the sink drain to make sure all the pressure was going towards the clog.

As the dishwasher started draining, I could hear the water gurgling and trying to find the path of least resistance.... which turned out to be me and my ill-fated attempt to cover the sink drain. I attempted to bleed out a little pressure from the drain resulting in a rain of hot dishwasher water and orangie pulp... like a citrusy Mount Vesuvius. The window about my sink is completely covered in orangie bits and smells fairly nice.

BTW - the sink is still clogged.

TL;DR- CLogged my kitchen sink, used dishwasher pump to try to dislodge the clog and created a huge mess.


P.S. If anyone has any tips (aside form calling a plumber), please advise.

UPDATE1 - A lot of people asking about the setup. I have a two basin stainless sink. The disposal and the other basin have separate p-traps (not my doing).  Both of those traps are routed into a Y connector with a cleanout.  My plan after work is to pull the cleanout and see how that goes.

UPDATE2 - I believe the clogs is after both p-traps as the water level in both basins stays fairly level.

UPDATE3 - Instead of taking a picture, I drew a [shitty one](http://imgur.com/ZSi30aW) for you fine people.

"TIFU by my missing exit and setting in motion a series of unfortunate events


This happened today, I just got home. I was driving home from Long Island to NJ and for reasons that I cannot remember, after sitting in traffic forever on the LIE, I miss the exit for the Verrazzano because I was trying to get back at someone for doing something stupid in another lane(they made the exit, so I even failed at that). And thus begins the fuck ups.


 I'm using gps on my phone and it begins taking me down a variety of streets in Brooklyn after sending me off the highway, presumably to turn around. Problem was, for whatever reason, the gps would get lost every 5 seconds, which is kinda an issue in the city because you don't have the liberty of time to wait for it. After getting me mildly lost, it's about to put me back on the right track and is telling me to go straight, THEN CHANGES TO LEFT and I swing left and make it, BUT I hit a curb I didn't see. I continue up the on ramp and am about to merge when I realize I caused a flat. Fuck me. 

I pull over and pop the trunk thinking ""well, it's inconvenient, but at least I have a spare and jack"". Nope, my younger brother had wrecked the two cars in the house earlier in the year, each replacing the last, and while the jack had made it into the second car with the tire iron, I apparently never moved them into this one. Mother. Fucker. 

I then call my dad, who I immediately assume the worst(he's sleeping and left his phone downstairs, I'm only 21) and tell him of my predicament. He has me call the insurance company, and for reasons beyond my comprehension, I begin by telling the insurance person that I am in the wrong boro. I know full fucking well that the Verrazzano goes from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and yet, I insisted for 10 minutes that I am in Queens, leading all directions I gave to the woman trying to help me useless. I'm eating up my phone battery, which I realize I forgot the charger for and is now at 28%, my only way of calling for help AND my directions for getting home. Another monumental fuck up. 


Eventually I managed to convey where I was, and she tells me that they can't send a tow there, for whatever fucking reason. I'm running out of battery, so I quickly wrap up the call and start walking back up on the on ramp(I walked back earlier to get the address of the nearest cross street). While I'm walking up the ramp, a guy slows down and pulls up to me and asks if I need a ride, I tell I've got a few hundred yards ahead and ask him if he's got a jack and tire iron. He says maybe, and invites me in. He pulls in behind my car and we get out and check his trunk, he has both. I am saved. I fucking love this guy. 

We begin to set up the jack and raise the car, and proceed to attempt to remove the bolts on the wheel. Turns out, his didn't fit the bolts, wasn't one of the 4 sided ones. FUCK. ME. We go back and double check his trunk and mine and come up empty handed. He agrees to stick around for a bit and let me charge my phone in his car, again, this guy is a fucking savior and the MVP of Thanksgiving. 

Suddenly, a tow truck with flashing lights pulls up alongside me and him. We look at each other and wonder where it came from, then I remembered I told me dad where I was, I guess he managed to send a tow(insurance company is full of shit, what else is new). I talk to the tow driver and he says to have the other guy move, but before the other guy goes, he knew I didn't have a charger and my battery was dying, AND HE GAVE ME A CAR CHARGER. THIS MAN DESERVES A FUCKING MEDAL. I thank him repeatedly and he heads out, and I move the car onto the bed of the tow. 

The tow driver gives me the rates and everything, then tells me that he only takes cash. It should be noted at this point that I have had my debit card number memorized for years, but have forgotten my pin 3 times. My card is thus, locked, at least if I want to use an ATM, for whatever fucking sense that makes. And I have no cash on me. Eventually, my dad ended up having to come and pay the guy and the tow truck guy was stuck with me for an hour while my dad drove into ~~Queens~~ Brooklyn and paid for the tow and tire change. Turns out the tow guy could have impounded my car for my inability to pay, but was a really nice guy. 

TL;DR I managed to turn a 2 hour trip into a 5 hour trip, wake up my dad on Thanksgiving and make him drive out to pay my tow bill, and all of this because I missed my exit. Don't miss your exit or do anything else I did. Tonight was the collective fruition of a basket of poor decisions, some nurtured over time(my card has been locked for like 4 months). "
"TIFU by handcuffing my girl and not having the right key.


So this happened this past Halloween. Some months ago, I bought these pink handcuffs from the flee market. We were planning on using them for the bedroom. Well my girl dressed up as a sexy police officer for Halloween. Before we were leaving to go out I grabbed the cuffs and hand cuffed her. I have a real handcuff key on my car keys so I was going to take them off. Little did I know these handcuffs were different and required a different key. She gets extremely upset and demands I take her to the popo station after learning I didn't have the right key. I explain to her that they will not be able to open them because I have the same key as them. She insist so I take her to a police station, while she is dressed up in a sexy police outfit to get the cuffs removed. After I explained to the police what happened I could tell they were holding back laughter. Surprise surprise they were unable to remove them. I finally Google how to pick handcuffs and were able to remove them. Lesson learned test handcuffs before use. We look back and laugh at this now.


TL;DR handcuffed girl while she was dressed in sexy police outfit, didn't have right key, went to the police station and eventually got them removed.

Edit: we had the key just miss placed it. I did not test the handcuffs before because I have 3 hand cuff keys at the house and figured one would work, none of them did and I learned there are more then one key. I put them on her quick right as we were getting into the car. I felt like they would have made a good addition to her costume. When she told me to take them off I inserted my key and then made an oh shhh face.

Edit 2: I have handcuff keys because where I work we are required to carry handcuffs(not a police officer). I have 3 keys because I was issued 2 then giving an additoanl key. My girl did agree to allow me to take a pic of her in the outfit with the hand cuffs tomorrow but I fear no one would see it anyway cause who goes back to the post?

Edit 3: I am going to try and post the pics for all the, ""your a liar people"", and the people who just wanna see tomorrow.
