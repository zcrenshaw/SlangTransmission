"TIFU by losing a customers baby photos.


To clarify, I work in a phone retailer in the UK where it's common to do a data transfer for customers buying a new phone from their old one. 

A young couple had come in, toddler in tow, to get their new device and had been incredibly helpful by loading all their data on to a micro SD card ready for the new device. Despite them offering to do it at home, part of our good service guidelines is to do it in store for them. Some may know that many phones spring load their micro SD cards so that pushing it in to the device pops it back out.

This phone, for whatever reason, had a ridiculously powerful spring that immediately shot the SD card out at such a force I didn't even see it go. So I'm standing there with no card, no knowledge and in store music drowning out any sound of where it landed. 

I searched, my colleagues searched, but to no avail. These photos were majority baby photos documenting this kids entire life and had helpfully been backed up on to one card with no other options. No Dropbox style backups, no PC backups, nothing but that card. The customer was understanding but incredibly upset and when store closed I promised to stay behind and look before the cleaners descended. 

This was two months ago. No sign.

This week we had keyboard issues. Four buttons weren't working. It's likely to be a blockage as keyboards tend to work fully or not at all. As I prised the buttons off it became rapidly more obvious that black plastic was blocking it. Sure enough, an SD card. Tested it and there's the couple, there's the kid, everything. In two months we have thousands of customers so I had no way to contact them but to search archive upon archive of paperwork to try and find them. 

To cut a long story short, I did. I rang, returned and apologised for the heartache and they couldn't be happier. I pride myself on my service and it had bothered me for months. 

TLDR I lost a customers baby photos for two months and hunted them down to return it. Now I can sleep at night. "

"TIFU by befriending an Uber driver


So of course this didn't happen today, but last Friday. I decided that I wanted to have a couple drinks and have a good time on Friday, but I do not know what moderation is. After drowning my body with almost a liter of overpriced gin I was ready to go downtown. Drinking that much alcohol in a short amount of time really fucked with me (go figure) and I only lasted about an hour at the bars. 
Que the uber ride home. At this point I was blacked out so I have no recollection of the roughly 10 minute ride home. According to my girlfriend, I had struck up a conversation with this man about how I was a world class golf coach and play a couple of Pro-Am tournaments every month.Now spoiler alert,  I know absolutely nothing about golf. Not shit. So my uber driver, let's call him Jim, is buying the whole thing. He asks if I could knock a few strokes off of his game and get him in touch with the president of the local country club. I tell Jim of course and I can also get him this guy's number because I play a few rounds with him every weekend. I let him now I'd help him out in any way possible to get his golf game back on track. 
I realize now that that may have been a giant mistake. I wake up the next morning still slightly drunk and my girlfriend asks if I remember talking to the uber driver last night. I say no and think nothing of it. She gives me the rundown and I just laugh it off.
 About four hours later I'm at work and one of my coworkers was like hey, someone wants to talk to you. I finish with a customer and go see what this guy wants. It struck me as a bit odd when he addresses me by name but eh, whatever. He asks if I got him some guys phone number and I had to explain to him that I had no idea who he, or the guy who's phone number he wants is. And this is when he tells me that he is Jim, my uber driver. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I have to crush this nice old man's dreams now and tell him I know absolutely nothing about golf. I try my best to tell him that I cannot help him in any way and try to explain that I was bullshitting the whole conversation. Jim doesn't take too well to this and just walks off while mumbling under his breath ""I guess that's just how the world works sometimes."" Way to make me feel bad, Jim.

Tl;dr: Got intoxicated and turned into a pro golfer who gives empty promises about golf lessons and fancy memberships."
"TIFU by playing Pokemon GO


So a few hours ago I downloaded Pokemon GO (I live in New Zealand) and enjoyed walking around my city collecting items from Pokestops/ capturing Pokemon etcetera, before going home. Around half an hour ago I decided to leave my house and skate around my suburb to see if I could catch any interesting Pokemon, or gain some cool items. About 5 minutes into skating slowly down the footpath my board is blocked by an uneven surface and I go flying across it with my phone. More worried about making a painful landing, I let go off my phone and try to cushion the landing with my hands, but because my reaction time is just as fast as a sloths my face planted the same time my hands reached the pavement. My phone was also thrown directly into the ground, which cracked the screen. Now i'm at home typing this up from my laptop because my phone won't do what I want it to do.

TL;DR - Wanted to catch 'em all, ended up catching my fall (Sorta), oh, and breaking my phone."
"TIFU by hooking up with a girl and having the worst walk of shame of my life


So this story happened a while ago, but when I told it to a friend of mine he urged me to post it here. So here goes..

I was at a party in a flat where only students live and at a certain time I was getting pretty intoxicated. I’m not quite sure how it started, but at some point I was making out with this girl, let’s call her Emily, who lived on the same floor the party was at. We wanted some more privacy and thus she was dragging me to her room, which had been seen by some other girls. I think for the story it’s good to know that most people knew each other at this party. The girls who saw us were friends of Emily and they all had another friend who I had hooked up with a while before this party. Anyway, we entered the bedroom, locked the door and things were progressing to the point where we were no longer wearing clothes. The girls who spotted us thought Emily couldn’t do this to their mutual friend and they were banging on the bedroom door. We were pretty drunk and the banging on the door, combined with screaming was kind of disturbing. In fact, Emily thought she could convince her friends that I was not in her room, so that they would leave and we could continue. She quickly put some clothes on, but obviously I had to hide and the only place our drunk minds could think of was her closet. So while she was telling her friends to leave, I was hiding in the closet. I honestly believe they could still see my clothes on the floor though.

They soon left though and we were able to continue. About 10 minutes later, I think, they were back and we were getting annoyed. Once again she opened the door to tell them to leave. This time I just hid under the blankets; she asked me to. They obviously knew Emily wasn’t alone, but she thought she would just say it was someone else who was with her. The girls actually came in the room and I heard them talking right beside me. One person actually sat down on the bed, but that might have been Emily as well, I never found out. I was just not giving a fuck (literally) and waiting for them to finally leave, which they eventually did.

 However, this is when shit got weird.. Before we went to sleep, I had to pee. Emily didn’t want me to go to the toilet, because then her friends would see me coming out of her bedroom. She suggested I used some sort of bucket she had in her room. So, I was peeing in a bucket in her bedroom, which was really strange to me. I remember thinking, why am I even doing this? I was honestly happy that I could sleep after that. In the middle of the night I woke up, when I noticed she was moving around. I was half asleep and not really sure if I was seeing things right, but it seemed as if she was peeing next to the bed. I’m not sure if she realised it, or maybe she thought the bucket was there or something. All I know is that she was still very drunk and I just fell back asleep. And then the morning sun rose and we were both waking up. I just wanted to go home asap and got out of bed to search for my clothes. And then I saw them lying next to the bed, on her side. I remembered waking up in the middle of the night, but I was hoping I had it all wrong. I did not. I picked up my clothes and they were wet. My jeans, shirt and vest had been freaking pissed on. The only thing I thought of was the fact that I had to cycle home for about 20 minutes, and I could not do that in my underwear only. So I just sucked it up, put on my pissed on clothes, cycled home and showered for about an hour while thinking: what the hell happened? Emily and I never spoke of the pissed on clothes. I think she was too drunk to remember and I just found it way too awkward to tell her.

TL;DR, Got drunk and hooked up. She pissed all over my clothes, had to go home wearing them. NEVER FELT SO DIRTY

EDIT: Okay so people seem to think the vest is weird. I'm also not sure if vest is the correct word, maybe its a cardigan. At least this is what it looks like: http://www.asos.com/ASOS/ASOS-Cardigan-In-Teal-Green-Cotton/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=6359938&amp;cid=7617&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=36&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Teal&amp;totalstyles=462&amp;gridsize=3 "
"TIFU By helping a guy not drown and trusting society.


I was out with a few friends last night for my 22nd birthday, we decided to head to a bar. I was walking along a canal with my girlfriend and another of our friends when we see a guy climbing from balcony to balcony that was overhanging the canal. We tried calling out to him but he seemed too drunk to notice. We stayed and watched and suddenly he dropped into the canal. I immediately started running to help him. I throw my wallet and phone on the top of the step going down to a grass area so I could jump in if needed. Luckily we got the attention of more people and managed to get a safety ring to one of them. 
Unfortunately when I went back to my phone and wallet someone had taken them both. I eventually managed to track the phone down with findmyiphone and the help of the police but the wallet seems to be gone forever.

Edit: Someone handed my wallet into the police station, I assume it has no cash left I in it but will be glad to get anything left. 
Edit 2: Wallet returned without the cash as expected but nothing overly much to worry about.
Edit 3: Yup should have gave my stuff to gf or friend, and all cards have been cancelled and the bank notified."
"TIFU by crying in front of some strangers.


I had to put my dog/best friend of 14 years down a month ago.  To say it was traumatic is an understatement.  He was ornery, barked at everyone, peed on everything, and absolutely hates my husband's feet.  But he was loyal to me and I had him since he was a pup so I put up with him.

So today I was at work, I do scheduling and insurance authorizations for an outpatient diagnostic imaging department at a hospital, and I heard some heavy breathing behind me as I was walking to the cafeteria.  

I turned around and it was two Bernese Mountain dogs.  The hospital volunteers have therapy dogs that make the rounds and offer support with pet/touch therapy.  Me being the dog lover that I am I ask if I can give them some belly rubs.

And I immediately start bawling my eyes out!  I'm a 34 year old Army Vet for goodness sake and I can't keep it together long enough to give tummy rubs!  The two volunteers are absolutely stunned.  They just looked at each other in total bewilderment while I'm on my knees in the middle of a hospital walkway with patients and hospital staff passing me by and I'm clutching onto this giant dog saying ""I'm so sorry"" in between sobs.

The volunteers start fumbling for words ""Can we call someone for you?""  ""What department do you work in?""  ""Do you know this woman?""

I sense that I'm drawing a crowd and get off the floor while muttering apologies and run to the nearest elevator.  Everyone just stands there, exchanging looks like they can't believe what they just witnessed.  Needless to say I won't be going to the cafeteria anytime soon.

TL;DR Had to put my dog down, lost my sh*! Over a therapy dog, and scared the bejesus out of their handlers and a crowd of people.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

**UPDATE**

So I went to bed after reading a few comments thinking how nice it is to know I'm not the only one who's made a fool of themselves in public over a fur baby.  I figured I'd get a few more upvotes, a troll would eventually call me out for my service (honestly not much service, went to a bunch of schools, broke my ankle on a 15k road march and got discharged), and that would be the end of it.

Now I'm at work with my brand new Game of Thrones lunch bag - Winter is coming?  Oh heck no, Winter is HERE! - and HOLY COW!!!  I never expected this kind of response.  I can't stop smiling knowing this has touched others.  You guys have bolstered my courage enough that I'm going to stop by the volunteer auxiliary desk and try to explain what happened.  

Also, my husband is taking me to a local humane society shelter today after work to see some pups.  He knows full and well that I may have another outburst but at least I'll know it's coming.  If we find a bond with a dog then we'll adopt.  If we don't then we're going to sponsor one and cover their adoption fee.  We also plan to sponsor one dog a month in memory of my little guy.

Thanks again to everyone!

"TIFU and broke my wife's face


So today we find roach droppings on the counter top of our new apartment. (I posted about the terrible decision of selecting this place the other day on tifu but it was removed.) 


I decide to check the tops of the cabinets as they may be home to these bastards. I climb on top of the counters by the sink to take a look, and everything is good just a bit of dust but no droppings. Well my kitchen is like a rectangular shape and in order to check the other cabinet tops I need to get around the stove and the stove hood... 

At this point I have two options I can try and walk around the stove or I can get down and climb up on the other side. My lazy butt decides to just try and wiggle to the other side.

I go to step around the stove and my stomach hits the corner of the over hood. I lose my balance and I am falling with my neck aimed right for the countertop corner. In my head I am thinking I am going to die, all because I was too lazy and too fat to get down and climb back up.

That is when my wife comes and saves my life! She tackles me as I am falling and catches my 250 lbs butt with her shoulder and face. She tilts me so that I fall with her to the floor instead of breaking my neck on the countertop. I scratched my arm on the fall and twisted my leg, but she took the most damage as her face is swollen and she has a black eye.


Tldr: forced my wife to save my life and it broke her face.

"TIFU by publicly accusing my fiancee of cheating on me


Ex-fiancee now. Throwaway because of how stupid I was.

I went away for a friend's bachelor party. We went to Nevada. My fiancee and I have been together for 2.5 years and our wedding is in 6 months. She told me her cousin Stacey was coming down for a week while I was gone.

So while I was in Nevada another friend of mine texts me that he had seen my girlfriend out with this guy. He figured she was probably a friend or something but this friend lives up the street from us and he said there was truck parked in my driveway. The next night he saw her go in with this guy and the guy stayed all night.

I told my girlfriend that we had decided to stay in Nevada for an extra two days but I went back early and I followed her and this guy to see for myself. She even told me on the phone she was with her cousin and didn't mention the guy at all. I took all the pictures my friend had taken after I asked him to and the ones I took and posted them on Facebook with her tagged and a message about her openly running around with this guy and him spending a bunch of nights at our house while I was away and how she was a liar and a cheat.

The guy was her cousin Stacey. Fucking everyone jumped all over me right after I posted. Stacey is a girl's name and I had no damn idea. Apparently I met him at some wedding before. She moved out and her sister who is a cop dropped the ring off."
"TIFU by forgetting I bought potatoes


Alright guys, this actually happened like an hour ago. Okay, so I buy groceries from week to week. As a single guy living alone, I usually just buy enough to last me the week. At some point in my multitude of grocery store trips, I bought a bag of potatoes. I think I may have used like one or maybe two potatoes from the entire bag before forgetting that I even bought them. Now, fast forward x amount of time (I can't remember how much time has passed since I bought them). At this point, I had been noticing a few gnats had been flying around apartment, to which I had no idea the cause. I am a relatively clean guy. I don't leave dishes or any puddles of water, and I have no plants (read online somewhere this attracts them). So, I buy some ribbon tape and notice it catches a few but the problem persisted. Anyway, I was making cereal in my kitchen and slicing bananas to put in my goddamn honey nut cheerios, and for whatever fucking reason I remember the potatos I bought way too fucking long ago, and I think, ""oh, i should throw them out. They are definitely not any good anymore"". So I open the cabinet where I keep my potatoes, and I was not prepared for what the fuck I was about to see. The potatoes had gone passed the point to where I don't think I could call them potatoes. There was this thick brown liquid stuff that had specs all over it that somehow made its way into my crock pot (forgot to mention crockpot is only other thing in the potato cabinet). As I opened the cabinet a plethora of gnats flew out and this unbearable stench was coming from the potatoes and brown liquid stuff. I immediately nope the fuck out and throw the potatoes and crock pot out in my apartment complex's dumpster. I come back in to examine the brown liquid stuff and to holy fucking hell, the specs on the brown liquid are larvae squirming around. I have never felt mmore gross or disgusting ...

TL;DR
I bought a bag of potatoes, forgot about them and it became a giant orgy breeding ground for gnats."
"TIFU and forgot that I am coffee's bitch...


Here I am at 12:59 am making coffee. Why? Because today I was so excited to have Ovaltine, that I forgot my morning caffeine intake and since I drank water for the rest of the day (the convenient work coffee machine not being close at hand), my body rebelled. My head started hurting this afternoon and by evening was absolutely raging. I raced home, trying to make it to my own personal toilet before vomiting from the pain. That didn't occur. Twice. Side of the road. Sorry potential future neighbors or friends. I cancelled my awesome go out tonight plans, took some headache meds, fell asleep, and then woke up with the head still wanting to kill me. I took some more excedrin to no avail. Then it dawned on me. Coffee! Now I'm sipping it and can feel the tension and pain draining from my body. Damn you liquid joy!"
"TIFU by failing a semester


My semester was going good and I was passing all my subjects then halfway through my grandmother died, because of this I found it really hard to concentrate and fell behind in my classes and ended up failing a semester.

Now I got an email saying that I have to withdraw from the faculty of science, I only needed 4 more courses to get my BSc. I am now preparing to submit an appeal and explain situation in 300 words.

TL;DR: My life just got screwed, grandmother died, failed classes and forced to withdraw from univeristy with a mountain of debt and several wasted years of my life. Trying to submit an appeal."
