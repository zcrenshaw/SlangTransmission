"TIFU by putting a dildo in my gun case (NSFW)


This happened a couple weeks ago...

My aunt and sister-in-law came to visit my neck of the woods, but I'd just returned from a business trip and hadn't been home yet when we met up. They wanted to see my new apartment, so we headed over to my place. I went back to my bedroom to change out of the airplane clothes (I can't be the only one who does this, right?), and notice I'd left a purple vibrator on my bedside table (my husband had jokingly purchased the brightest, most obnoxious purple vibrating eggplant he could find, because we're apart a lot for work and he laughs at my affinity for purple). I went to put it away just as my sister in law walked into my bedroom. Having family see you holding a vibrating jelly stick strikes me as odd, so I ducked down and went for the first concealing item I saw: my pistol case. I quickly and snugly tucked the vibrator in the foam-lined case alongside my pistol, stuffed it under the bed and went on my merry way. No harm, no foul, no weird looks at Thanksgiving.

A few days later, I'm headed to the gun range for some target shooting. I grabbed my guns, some ammo, and headed out. It was such a quick and seemingly insignificant moment with the vibrator, I'd forgotten about stuffing it into the pistol case (the gun is purple, too, btw). I arranged everything on the table, and opened my gun case. In what seemed like slow motion, I opened the gun case -- the dildo, uncomfortably stuffed alongside the pistol, rolls out of the case, perfectly bumps something (the table, I assume?), starts vibrating, and comes to a rest on the floor. Past the table. This means, ladies and gents, that it's past the area you can go; there is a purple vibrating dildo lying amongst the spent brass shells. While I was in my own lane, there were 15-20 people in the other lanes. For the briefest moment, recognition seemed to fill the area as the gun range fell silent... 15 people watching the hapless dildo vibrate and twist it's way across the shooting range. Fortunately, it was only a couple feet past the table, so I grabbed the broom intended for sweeping shells, pulled it back under the table, turned it off, and threw it away. Looks like I have to find a new range now...  

TL;DR - in trying to hide a dildo, I put it in a gun case and proceeded to spill it onto a public gun range. "
"TIFU By trying to shake Obama's hand and almost getting taken out by Secret Service and ruining thousands of peoples day.


As with most TIFU, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post I saw on the front page. During the 2008 election, Obama came to my University to give a speech. I went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. I was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

When Obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a QandA session. When he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. I was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. Everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. He had a pen in his hand and was signing away. I thought to myself ""Damn, I don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm OH WAIT! Yes I do. My ticket I used to get into the event."" There was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my INSIDE jacket pocket**. So as the future president is 4 people away, I hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. Just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

They immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. It all happened so fast I couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all I had was a piece of paper for Obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. I was just able to get my bearings about me and I was the last person to shake Obama's hand at that event.  About that time the security all turned to Obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. As Obama was being ushered out he said ""Sorry guys, they said I have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. So not only did I almost get taken out by secret service, I ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.




TL;DR: Tried to shake Obama's hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made Obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day.

"TIFU by cleaning my humidifier and almost killing my entire family


Obligatory - This actually did happen today.

My family and I live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central Arizona, USA.  The whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  For those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  Since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  Basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  It's one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.

For various reasons not apropos to this TIFU, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  Today I decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  Possibly inspired by another recent TIFU, I also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  While cleaning, though, I noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""No big deal,"" thought I.  Eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  I scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.

Here's where the TIFU really starts.  Some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  I decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places I couldn't reach.  ""But,"" thought I, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  I figured I should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, I figured, is better at that than bleach?

Right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""Uh, dude..."" Yeah, I know.  Or, I should have known.  But I didn't think it through, so I poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  Almost immediately thereafter, I took a whiff and started coughing.  At that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  Turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and I'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system.

I immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  Of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  So now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days I'll be coughing like I've got the black lung, Pa.

TL;DR - Tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.

EDIT - Words

EDIT 2 - Front page, neat.  It has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine - I think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  Finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that I'm an engineer, I have to - if everyone doesn't know, I'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  Can't have that.

EDIT 3 - Lot's of fake internet points AND my first gold!?  It's almost worth the war crime!  Thanks!"

"TIFU by trying to scare my wife. NSFW


This actually happened today.  I'm writing this while currently in the doghouse.  So my wife and I are just finishing a nice shared bath.  We are almost ready to get out when she notices that her crazy bipolar dog is sitting by the tub shaking instead of her usual spot under the bed in fear of her getting her own bath.  My wife being slightly paranoid instantly thinks something or someone must be in the bedroom that is making the dog scared.  She ignores my logic that the dog is bipolar and if there were anyone or anything in the bedroom she would be going nuts barking.  Not to mention my husky is in the living room and would not let anyone in without doing something.  

Well.  We get out of the tub and start to dry off all the while my wife is eyeing the bathroom door into the bedroom which is wide open.  She finishes drying off and as women do she wraps the towel around her.  Now she needs to check out the bedroom.  She literally gets down near the door and starts crawling towards the door.

Here is where my fuck up happens.  She is crawling in nothing but a towel about to peak around the doorframe to the rest of the bedroom.  Of course what do I do standing there seeing her butt facing me holding a towel?  Yep.  I think a quick little pop to the butt will scare her good.  Without a second thought I let a light little flick of the towel fly.  Oh but I forget.  It's not how hard you flick the towel it's how you flick the towel.  It was almost perfect...except my aim was off.   Yes in my stupidity did i not only manage to pull off a perfect snap of the towel but i managed to perfectly center my aim right where no one ever wants to be hit.  It was literally looked like it was in slowmotion as I watched in horror the towel popping right in my wifes crack.  I knew the look well she gave when she turned and rolled to her back.  I get her up and breathing normal again and then I see the other look.  I know I deserve this look.  

She has recovered now and is sleeping soundly.  There was no after bath fun.  There will likely be no fun of any kind for as long as she is mad.  I have no idea how much laundry or dishes I will need to do.  Nor do I know how many flowers or dinners it will take.

TL;DR. tried to pop my wife in the butt to scare her.  Accidently hit her in her privates instead.  Her dog started everything rolling but now I'm the one in the doghouse."
"TIFU by taking a dump that destroyed part of my house


Well, actually, Tuesday I fucked up by taking a shit that destroyed part of my house, but rule #4 prevented this post from happening for a couple days. In the end, that's probably a good thing for the post, because the shit was just the tip of the iceberg. I've been fucking up every day since when trying to deal with this.

Tuesday morning, about 3 AM, I wake up and go to the bathroom. I sit down and know I'm in for some trouble because this dump is large and about to punish my butthole. Some pain and minutes later, I finish up and flush the toilet. Clogged. I shut the rising water off, grab the plunger and get to work. That clog ain't budging. Screw this, it's 3am, I'll deal with it after I actually wake up. I go to work on it again in the morning. Still ain't budging. Screw it. I shower and go to work, I'll deal with it when I get home.

I get home, head into the bathroom. The bowl of the toilet reeks. It's lined with dry shit water. I turn the water back on to let it fill back up and rinse the bowl, then I go sit down and watch some TV. About 15 minutes later, I hear a loud crash. There always used to be loud crashes in this house with no explanation, we'd chuckle and say it must be the ghost. Without missing a beat, I chuckled and thought, ""must be the ghost."" About 1/2 an hour later, I had to piss, and remembered I needed to unclog a toilet too. I walk around the corner, open the door, and holy shit.

The toilet is running. The flapper never came down and it just kept filling and filling until the floor is covered in shit water. I start to panic and dash in, throw towels on the ground, it's not enough. I run into my bedroom and start grabbing old shirts to throw down. Still not enough. I run back and grab an old sheet and comforter off the bed. That manages what's on the floor. As I stand there wrapping my head around this, I remember the crash 1/2 an hour earlier. My eyes dart to A/C vent on the floor... motherfucker, who puts a vent on the floor? I do the math and take off down the steps into the basement.

HVAC ducts all over the floor. Shitty pouring down through where those pipes used to be, all over the wash and dryer, all over cardboard boxes, clothes, files, records. And then I grab a nearby stool and sit down and watch as the water slows to a steady drip. ""Oh. Shit. This is bad."" 

Mopped the basement up, and started to let it dry. Came back up stairs and went into the bathroom. Threw the shit water soaked rug into the tub. Continued cleaning up what water was left over with my soon to be trashed shirts and bed clothes. Go into my bedroom to sit down and take just take everything in again. ""Hm, this carpet is a little wet. Must have tracked some water in with me earlier."" Fuck up number two. And in the end, the grandest fuck up.

Later that night, I notice the carpet isn't really drying. The wet foot prints I left, they were starting to become pretty soggy. I grab a towel, drop it on top of it, and start trying to soak it up. Fuck up number three because there was no method to my madness. I should have been working from the outside in. Instead, I was just spreading all that water out. By the end of the night, two or three soggy foot prints becomes a giant puddle of shit water in my carpet that will not relent. I stay up until around 2 AM, going at it from the outside in this time, but the damage has already been done. I put a fan on it and go to bed.

Wake up Wednesday morning. It's pretty bad. On the way home from work, I swing by a hardware store to rent a wet vac. The internet seemed pretty high on these thing's ability to suck water out of a carpet. Six hours later, I've maybe sucked 1/2 gallon a of water out. In the end, I think it only made things worse as several spots seemed much wetter than before. That's what, TIFU #4?

Things didn't seem too bad on Thursday. With the exception of a couple spots, the carpet was just damp. I kept a fan on it when it wasn't covered. Washed and dried some towels, dropped them to soak and went out for a couple hours. I get home, and the smell of shit is permeating through the house. I didn't think to close off the few A/C vents that still work. 

Friday morning. The carpet smell begins to hit. It wasn't too strong though. I take to the internet again. If your carpet's a bit damp, what does the internet tell you to do? Baking soda! So I threw that baking soda down and left for work. Turns out baking soda will fuck up your vacuum cleaner. I guess that's not too serious because it's not like it'll do it right off that bat, but I just feel like this week keeps on kicking. At this point, I'm out of ideas. I'm pretty sure it's gone through to the subfloor. Tearing the carpet and padding up wasn't really an option to begin with, and now I'm taking a break from cleaning out my room and preparing to tear everything up. I am defeated. 

TL;DR: Took a shit that flooded my bathroom. It destroyed the insulation, A/C, a ton of possessions, and now the additional nightmare of my carpet. 

Edit: So this took off since I last got to check it. Thanks for the gold, whoever did that!

Yes, there is home owner's insurance. Things are going to get taken care of. I got bent on trying to take care of the carpet without removing everything from my bedroom. I get now that it's something I can't tackle by myself. Those of you who told me to get a dehumidifier right away to help dry things out and slow down or prevent things from happening, I did that. I don't really know what else I can offer in the way of an update right now?

Some people seemed bothered that this started on Tuesday and not today? Sorry? I checked the rules and they said that was okay.

Anyway, glad some people got a kick out of it. Thanks for the comments and advice."
"TIFU by costing my business 15k and losing my dream job.


TIFU: So in honor of the norm of this sub this incident happened about a year ago.
I worked as a Travel Agent in rural Australia in a small office that was run by the largest Travel company in Aus.
I had a client come in one day one of my very first who wanted a basic travel package to Vanuatu, sure no problems easy enough I work it up for them take their money and send them on their way until their tickets are ready (about 4 months after the payment). Fast forward 6 months I get woken up at 3am from our customer relations team letting me know of my colossal fuck up. We had a system that let us know of all flight developments for the tickets purchased by our clients cancellations, time changes etc. Now I had next to no training on this system and thus very important message got overlooked by my rookie eyes. It turns out Virgin Australia had cancelled all flights to Vanuatu due to runway conditions about a week after I booked these flights. So my clients are at the airport at 3 in the morning being told that their flight DOES NOT EXIST. Long story short we paid for 2 first class tickets, 2 weeks of 5 star resort accommodation as well as food and drink expenses. Totalling $15,673AUD. And was promptly ""let go"". 
TLDR didnt know what I was doing customers tried to board a nonexistant flight and I cost the business 15K and lost my dream job"

"TIFU by leaving the bath tub water running and trying to run back to stop it from overflowing


Had mother's day celebration for my mom and wifes mom here at my house, to avoid having to do the drive of both houses as we typically do for every holiday. Last people to leave the house were saying their goodbyes so I turned on the bath tub to take my usual bath with my son. (toddler) Good bye's were drawn out and I forgot about bath tub, I heard a weird noise as if the washer and dryer was screwed or the hose or just something when I realized and remembered I left the water running in the bath tub...I ran (dummy) to turn off the bath tub, but the water had already made its way into the bedroom (tile) by the time I realized that there was water in the bedroom I was up in the air and landing on my head seeing the stars trying not to lose consciousness...worst part is that everybody was outside saying goodbyes so I had to drag myself halfway out the house until someone made their way back in because they left something. Iphone was in pocket...iphone 7 not as water resistant for sitting in 1 inch water for maybe 1 minute. Fortunately for me it was only 10 stitches and negative on the CT scan.

"TIFU by politely walking into my friend's 21st birthday party


OK, this didn't happen today, it happened 10 years ago...

A friend of mine was having her 21st birthday party at her house. She's Greek, so it was a huge family thing with about 100+ people there and I didn't really know anyone but her. It was a pretty formal event so I was rocking a cocktail suit type thing.

Anyway, I'd never been to her house before and it was out in the suburbs so I'm running properly late. By the time I get there the birthday girl is already giving her speech in front of a big crowd in her yard. The lights are dim so I figure I can just sneak in around the back of the crowd and wait for the speeches to be over. 

So  I see that there's a concrete driveway behind the crowd underneath a carport. I head down some steps and I'm walking behind the crowd onto the driveway, when I suddenly drop like I've missed a step - but this time I'm knee deep in water. 

My momentum keeps me going forward while my brain figures out that I've just stepped into a swimming pool. In what felt like slow motion, I plunged suit-and-all straight into the pool and I'm underwater coming to terms with the situation I've just landed in. I thought about what is going to happen when I come up to the surface, with a crowd of 100 strangers staring at me, so briefly contemplated exhaling and sinking to the bottom for eternity. Anyway I re-surface through a me-shaped hole in the pool and my fears are realised when everyone is laughing hysterically at me.

Turns out that the birthday girl had arranged for the pool to be covered in foam earlier. The foam had settled down leaving a grey film over the whole pool that, in the dim light, looked exactly like a concrete driveway - meanwhile there's no goddamn pool fencing. I ended up giving the birthday girl a soaking wet hug and splooching around in my wet shoes... word got around that I had been *pushed* in, so I went with that to save some face.

TL;DR: Tried to sneak into my friend's birthday party during her speech, and fell into a pool instead."
