"TIFU by choking on an orange during an important work meeting.


One hour ago I experienced this. I am currently sitting in the bathroom wallowing in shame. So at my job I am being considered for a promotion and need to act my very best and put on my smarty pants to wow everyone. A meeting is set up with my boss, my boss's boss, and a few other higher ups so I can give a presentation about my teams progress and ideas of future steps to take. There is a big platter of all sorts of fruit in the middle of the table. Nervous me thinks that I will look more relaxed and confident if I eat something (false) so I grab an orange slice. I peel off the skin and pop that bad boy in my mouth with such confidence I completely bypass my teeth and it slides right down my windpipe. At this point the meeting had already started and it was just moments before I stood up to present and literally all thoughts of everything leave my head as my adrenaline kicks in that I am choking on an orange and I am going to die in the middle of this room. I stand up (which knocks my rolling chair back which smacks into a water cooler and cracks the base), and instead of giving myself the Heimlich which I thought was engrained in my head, I reach my hand down the back of my throat to grab that son of a bitch. My brain focuses on getting it out only so I don't realize I have scratched the inside of my mouth in my quest and I am bleeding. After a couple seconds (what felt like a lifetime) I grab the orange, pull it out and fling it across the room... straight into the eye of my boss's boss... who then proceeds to freak out since the acidity of the citrus juice from the fruit is burning his eye. I squeak out ""Sorry!"" And squirt a glob of blood from my mouth onto the fruit platter....

Needless to say the meeting was cancelled shortly after that. I am sitting in the bathroom terrified to leave. 

TL;DR- important meeting for me, choke on orange, crack water cooler, throw orange from throat into bosses eye, burns his eye, spits blood on fruit platter. Awaiting my termination. Searching for new jobs soon...

Edit: Wow! Did not expect this to blow up like it did (thanks for the gold oh sweet stranger!) I'm glad many of you had a laugh at my miserable morning. Thanks for all the hilarious comments. I had initially gone to the bathroom to tend to my wounded mouth which was just a minor flesh wound on the inside of my cheek. I ended up smoothing things over by apologizing profusely and made a few bad jokes along the lines of ""I had a bad case of the Mondays."" The wounded eye boss man was very grumpy and I was a joke for my coworkers the rest of the day(foreseeing now the rest of my career there). I ended up doing the presentation a little after ""the incident"" and it went fairly well, all things considered, so hopefully when they are thinking later of promoting someone they think of the crazy blonde chick who threw up bloody orange on the boss.

"TIFU by listening to Ed Sheeran at work.


This literally happened an hour ago. Earlier this week I got my hands on the new Ed Sheeran album (Divide). Excited as I was to listen to it, I only got to this morning at work. Getting into work later than usual, and being a Friday, I thought I'dâ€‹ blast some tunes to end the week on a high. Everything was going swimmingly until the song ""Supermarket Flowers"" started (Ed's tribute to the passing of his grandmother). Well almost instantly the feels started. My stomach tightened up, throat clenched and tears started forming. Thinking I could breathe through it I had a drink of water and then the chorus hit and I lost it. As if time slowed I felt the first tear fall, hitting my paperwork and then I was done. Tears were falling as if Niagara Falls had made its way into my eyelids. My supervisor then walked into the room. What a sight I must have been, a sobbing bearded baby. Turning the music down I start damage control by explaining the song and that the feels got to me. But she just awkwardly stood there, saying ""OK"" and then slowly left the room. I composed myself, had a tea break and coming back to my desk there were councelling service pamphlets, and dealing with depression in the workplace printouts. The cherry on top, I have a session with the work shrink this afternoon to discuss what happened.


TL;DR Listening to Ed Sheeran at work, got the feels, lost it like a little girl losing her dolly, now my supervisor thinks I'm depressed and has scheduled a councelling session.

Update: Just got out of the meeting with the work shrink. After 30 minutes and telling me countless times I was in a ""safe space"" she has decided I'm suppressing what really happened. She has scheduled me in for fortnightly meetings until I ""open up"". So this FU is going to have long lasting effects. So really, TIFU by listening to Ed Sheeran and getting sent to therapy for the foreseeable future.

Edit: Wow gold, thankyou! This has gotten a lot bigger than I was expecting. Thanks everyone for the kind words, depression isn't something to take lightly and knowing that the service is available is definitely a positive to come out of the situation, even at my expense haha."
"TIFU by forgetting I'm not in Finland.


So, as usually, this fuck up didn't happen today, it was yesterday. I'm an film school student, working as an intern in Slovakia. Yesterday I was supposed to be at the studio at 5pm so as usually, I took a bus to the centre at 4.20pm and went for a lunch before hitting it up to the studio.

There is this fancy eat-all-you-can type of buffet restaurant in a shopping center. It's my restaurant of chose, when it comes to filling your stomach quickly. So, I finish eating, check the clock and realize I'm almost late from work.

From here starts the chain of unfortunate events. Yesterday was a laundry day. Instead of having a nice clean suit on me, I was rocking cargo pants, hoodie and a cap. I also had a pair of sunglasses on me and as I was in hurry, I put them on. I raise from the table, ""shout"" thanks to the restaurant, put on my earplugs and tune in some lovely Finnish death metal on max volume.

From there I start to walk fast and later on it transforms into full-on running trough the shopping centre. I was only a couple of meters away from the exit when a large mall guard craps me from my shoulder and then proceeds to drag me from my hoodie.

At this point I was really confused and quite upset about the fact that a large man is destroying my clothes. I go full aikido on him and on the process of destroying his hand it clicks on me. I HADN'T PAID FOR THE DINNER! Now, I don't know how it is in your country, but in Finland you have to pay for your buffet before you get to eat anything.

So there I am. Terrified in the middle of a fully crowded shopping centre, suspect of a shoplift and assault on a guard. I raise my hands up in the air and go something along the line ""Sir, I am so sorry, I was in hurry and I completely forgot to pay"". Now of course, this guy didn't understand a single word from the sentence and back we went to the restaurant ( this time he was only dragging me from my hand, rather than my hoodie ). The guard had a discussion with the restaurant owner in Slovakian language and then the owner just simply shakes his head. I tried to explain myself but nobody spoke any english.

The guard escorts me to a side room with a chair and a table and leaves me there. At this point I'm starting to grow a bit tired of the whole situation and laugh to myself because this kind of stuff only happens in the movies. I start to text my friends about the situation and run out of battery in a couple of minutes. Gladly there was a clock on the wall and I could tell the time. At around 17.35 a pair of police officers come to the room and GLADLY one of them speaks fluent english.

Indeed I was suspected from a shoplift and I was to pay for the charges. I explained how I've been in this restaurant many times and I've paid for my lunch each and every time with no problem. At this point the officer looks at me like I'm an idiot and asks me not to lie to him. The guard had told them that none of the staff had recognized me and that's the reason why I am in custody. I explained to them how on all the previous visits I had probably been wearing a suit. I also told them how I was in hurry and had to run to be able to make it in time and the fact that in Finland we have to pay first. Then the cops ask why I didn't respond to the guard tailing me and shouting to me. I felt like an idiot and that I will never get away with this, but I answered with the truth. I had my earplugs blasting music on full volume so I didn't hear anything.

The cops finally accept the fact that it was all a big mistake. We go to the restaurant and the cops ask the owner if he recognizes me with a suit and then apparently he remembers me and says ""sorry, sorry"" and something in Slovakia. The police translates it to me, saying that the owner was sorry for the whole thing ( wasted time and the guard dragging me from my hoodie ) and said that I didn't have to pay for the lunch. I refused the offer, paid and left the shopping centre, calmly walking, without the earplugs or sunglasses.

I arrived to the studio an hour late and everyone was relieved to see me. They had tried calling me countless of times and they were afraid that I had been kidnapped or something, because during the 4 weeks I've been in here, I've never been late before. They had even called the police on me...

EDIT: People seem to be quite worried about my ears and the fact that I might not be aware of the permanent damage it causes to blast music on too loud. I stated that I had my earplugs on ""full volume"" which nessesarely is not the truth. Just loud enough that I didn't notice someone calling for me in a foreign language! Thanks for your consern! &lt;3

EDIT 2: As for the band I was listening to, most likely Mors Principium Est. Check them out, they're amazing!

TL;DR an exchange student, forgot to pay for my dinner and accidentally acted as suspicious as one could, sat trough a police interrogation and caused global panic amongst my co-workers.

"TIFU by knocking myself out with a piece of pizza


This happened maybe 10 minutes ago and I'm still in the shock of this situation also my engrish is bad so bear with me. This might be the stupidest fuck up  I could ever imagine and I mean it. Here's how it all went down.

I came back from school, was a bit hungry so I popped one of those frozen pizzas in the oven. Not the healthiest option I know. Anyways we all know how dry these things can get, especially if you leave them in the oven a bit longer then you should. And that's what I did. 

But me being the glutton here, I wouldn't let that pizza go to waste and decided to eat it. So I sat down at the table with my pizza, reading something on my phone, went for the second bite. It was the crust of this already dry pizza and I took a really really big bite and swallowed it almost whole because I couldn't chew it properly. Now, I'm guessing you could imagine the feeling of this huge chunk of crust piercing through my esophagus in the most painful way. I could feel that fucker going down in the slowest way possible. I was all ""oh shiiiit"" in my brain and did what most sane people wold do and took a huge gulp from my soda. And guess what?? That fucking gulp also joined the bite and at that point I realized my vision was going black. All I could think was ""oh FUUU-""

Next thing I felt is hard cold kitchen ground underneath me. My cheek was pressed against and my head hurt like a motherfucker. I've never fainted before so I couldn't grasp the situation for a while. I saw my phone smashed into the pizza when I got up so I'm guessing I got blacked out, fell down and hit my head.

TL;DR the bite I took was so huge that it blocked my aorta or some shit and made me pass out.

Edit: Guys, thanks for all of your concerns and advice, I appreciate it. I'm all good now, only a tiny bump on my forehead. Most of you assumed I was a dude which is understandable I too tend to believe any internet stranger to be a male. And some of you said that my English isn't bad, thank you! You just can't be sure sure when it's not your native language, you know. 

Also that few people who tried to explain what an aorta is... really?"
"TIFU by dropping my phone in a deep fryer.


This happened yesterday, and i am still feeling the pain now.

So I was working my usual Monday shift at the fast food place I work at, dropping food in the fryers, same old same old. Mondays tend to be slower then most days, so I was just on my phone while talking to a coworker. Well I (had) a Galaxy S7 Edge with no case, and those things can be pretty slippery. So dumbly, I was look at instagram while by the fryers, and saw a funny meme. When I went to show my coworker, my phone slipped out of my hand and fell in the fryers. Now I kinda expected what was to come, so we both ran, as hot oil proceeded to blow everywhere. It still hit me and my coworker, me worse (of course), as I now have several burns all over my body. Even worse, i'm out of a $700 phone &amp; got written up by my GM for being on my phone and ruining the oil. Oh yeah, the mess wasn't fun to clean either.

TL:DR - phone in fryer = boom"
"TIFU by forgetting about a pot of rice on the stove, in a blizzard.


So a couple of days ago, the northeast USA got hit with winter storm Stella. Where I live got hit with about 2 feet of snow, but thanks to an abundance of wind, there are piles of accumulation anywhere from a few inches, to 3-4 feet due to the snow blowing around. More on that later.

I'm a college student, and I live with my boyfriend and 3 other housemates in our apartment. We all got a day off because of the snow, so naturally, we were smoking bowls and watching Netflix. As the munchies kick in, I remember that I have some left over curry from a local (delicious) Indian restaurant down the street, and decide to heat it up. And of course, you can't have curry without rice. So, I throw the curry in the microwave, put some rice and water on the stove on low, and decide to retreat back to the warmth of my room; my roommates don't like us to keep much heat on in the house, and my toes are cold.

A considerable amount of time later, we're watching a rather *steamy* part of the movie, and the music in the background is horribly arranged; or at least thats what I thought. This monotonous beeping keeps interrupting the beat......wait. Wasn't I cooking rice?

My high ass *forgot* about the rice, and I come out to an apartment **filled** with smoke, and two smoke alarms going off. I tell my roommates we should get out, as my boyfriend tries to get the rice out of the apartment (which was burning, but not on fire). My heart is racing and I'm in a state of panic, not helped much by the weed-- I run over to the door to open it and get some fresh air, when I see that none of us has shoveled the deck yet, and we're stuck behind about 3 feet of snow- most of which has blown over from our roof. 

Now starts the real panic.

Theres a wooden katana by our door that I stick through the small crack of an opening that I can manage with the screen door, and I start going crazy with it to try and loosen some snow. My boyfriend takes this over as I go to try and calm down/fan the fire alarm, that is now screaming ""EVACUATE"" at me. I go over to him a few minutes later, he mumbles something that I took as ""yeah, I'm getting there, blah blah blah try and squeeze through the door."" Theres a ~4 inch opening, and my adrenaline soaked body decides that we can fit through there. I squeeze through, bending the door, hyper-speed shoveling an area so he can open the door and my housemates can come outside. After a long while of shoveling in soggy pajama pants and a t-shirt, we were all safe and breathing fresh air.

After the place had been aired out thanks to the windows and some fans, we went back inside to get warm and hangout. What I failed to realize was that I was the only one freaking out, the whole time; as I'm trying to calm myself down (its been about 45 minutes and my heart is still beating out of my chest and my knees are still shaking), I start to feel something warm and wet on my shirt, along with a steadily increasing amount of pain. I lift up my shirt and find one normal breast, and one covered in blood from the nipple down. The shirt I was wearing was black, so I hadn't noticed the blood; after taking awhile to try and think of where the hell this came from, I remembered that I slipped through an opening between metal door and a wall that was about 4 inches too small for my body to comfortably slide by. Thanks to the crazy adrenaline/panic attack, I hadn't felt this at all. My pointy nipple ring (that catches on EVERYTHING) had gotten caught on the door, and almost nearly *ripped completely out of my nipple.*

Yeah.

So now my house smells like nauseating smoke, I ruined one of my favorite pots, and I ripped my favorite nipple in half. I might need to work on handling stress better.

I've since taken out that nipple ring, and will be sporting a bandaid on that nipple until it heals. RIP right nipple.

Moral(s) of the story; 
1. ALWAYS stay in the kitchen while you're cooking something! or, set a timer and stay close. Don't do what I did.
2. It's fun to be snowed in, but don't let yourself *literally* be snowed in. Keep up with the snow, shovel it (reasonably) as its accumulating so you're ready in an emergency, and to make it easy on your back. You *never* know whats going to happen.

**TLDR;** gets high, makes rice, forgets about rice. Smoke alarms go off in abundance, tries to leave apartment, snowed in behind 3 feet of snow. Gets wild kick of adrenaline, has panic attack, tries to squeeze out of much too small an opening of the door to shovel to safety. Comes down from panic attack/adrenaline, realizes nipple ring got caught on the door, now has a nipple ripped in half.

"TIFU by getting three traffic tickets at once


About a week ago, I was driving back home from school just after the sun had gone down. I'm a pretty good driver with a fairly clean record, so I never expect to actually get pulled over for stuff, but after I stopped at a light, a police cruiser came up behind me and pulled me over. Of course, like any sane person would do, I immediately started wracking my brain trying to figure out what I had done wrong.

The officer came to my window and told me that my tail light was out. Okay, fair. Not that big of a deal.

I knew that my tail-light had been damaged a few days earlier by someone backing into it, but I was dumb enough not to test it and make sure that it was working, so even though I was caught off guard, I wasn't actually surprised. The officer noticed. Ticket one.

I gave the officer my license, and after a momentary pause, he went to his car to look me up in the database and fill out a ticket. I thought he would be back in a minute, but he wasn't. 5 minutes turned into 10 minutes turned into 30 minutes. Naturally, my mind started racing. ""Oh shit, did I forget to pay something, am I going to jail?"" etc, etc. Every moment, I was becoming more and more panicky and trying to fight back the urge to get out of the car and find out what was taking so long (obviously a terrible idea).

When the officer FINALLY came back, he explained that he had noticed my tag was expired on the way back to his car. On top of that, my license had just expired last month as well; apparently, if it had been just a week or two later, I would have been on my way to jail. Ticket two. Ticket three.

Obviously, I'm an idiot for not staying on top of those things, but what started out as someone backing into my tail light in a parking lot turned into $500 worth of tickets...plus I have to get the tail light fixed. RIP my paycheck.

TL;DR Got pulled over for a broken tail light, ended up with three tickets totaling $500. Thanks life."
"TIFU by making my own sex toy


NSFW - I was doing an article on DIY sex toys when I saw this video in sexplanations where she used an inflated latex surgical gloves to create a sex toy (fleshlight-ish). I was alone, I had a box of surgical gloves so I thought why the hell not. 


After two failed attempts ( one was just shaped weird and the other one had a slow leak 'cause I accidentally cut with the hobby knife I used -this is a very important detail) I finally had a sex toy. I whipped out some KY and went to town. Afterwards I was just sitting there, with an inflated rubber glove that was dripping fluids which I needed to get rid of. 


Remember that slow leak I said earlier? Yeah, I think part of my brain was still shut down when I figured I should just pop it with the x-acto blade and it should slowly deflate... 


That slowly deflating part, only works when the gloves aren't inflated to their limits. As I unfortunately learned. I slowly rubbed the tip of the blade on the surface of the glove/sex toy trying to create a small leak. It popped. The inflated glove/sex toy, popped sending jizz shrapnel everywhere. It was on my keyboard. My bed. My shirt. My shorts. My hair. Some on my face. Hours later I still finding spots that I missed. 


TL;DR - Made a sex toy out of an inflated glove, popped it with a knife, jizz everywhere."
"TIFU by stabbing myself in the ass (with a fork)


Hi! Longtime lurker on here--this is actually my first real post so please be kind. I am 16/F, it was my first time in an ambulance, and I'm ok now!!

Anyways, it had been a seemingly uneventful day (especially since it was a snowday). My sister and I have been obsessed with the Great British Baking Show lately, so we passed the storm by attempting to make a swiss roll. After a family dinner, we were cleaning up and putting dishes away in the open dishwasher. I wanted to present the cake and put a little powdered sugar on top to jazz it up (a decision that would come back to ~~bite~~ stab me in the ass). This prompted me to get the sifter, which is conveniently located directly to the right of the OPEN dishwasher. Within this dishwasher and closest to the sifter-containing cabinet was the separate compartment for dirty cutlery, all standing to attention. So, in my motion to bend down to retrieve the tool, my unsuspecting butt felt 4 identical pricks as the tines of the offending dinner fork poked through my pants and sank about 1/4 inch into my lower left cheek. 

At first, I was more in shock than anything, and was probably a pretty comical sight as I jumped up with the fork still attached to my rear. Initially, it hurt, but it was bearable. My mom freaked out and I literally had to calm *her* down. I asked her to pull it out, which is when I realized (painfully) that it was in pretty deep. Soon enough, the rest of my family saw that the situation was kinda serious--albeit hilarious-- and they jumped into action. My mom called my neighbor, a chiropractor, and my sister called 911. My *dad* however, tried to dominate the situation. He did this by incessantly demanding we by trust his boyscout knowledge of puncture wounds, and just yank it out and apply pressure. However, my sister already had a professional on the phone so my dad's aggressive input was unnecessary and quite unhelpful to the already tense environment. In fact, it literally caused the dispatcher to think that a stabbing had actually occurred because of the yelling, so they sent like 5 squad cars along with the ambulance. They arrived within like 1 or 2 minutes, it was almost spooky how quick it was. I was ok by the time the EMTs arrived, a little shaken up by my dad's behavior--I had cried a bit--but they wrapped it up and had a laugh doing it. It was a good reminder of how ridiculous the whole thing was. I was smiling by the time I got to the emergency room, where I was quite obviously the entertainment on a slow night. Basically every nurse tried to act like they were involved so they could see the girl with a fork in her ass. It was great fun. They didn't really make a production out of it, they just stuck me with some numbing shots and yanked it out, having to cut a favorite pair of pants in the process :(. No stitches necessary. And apparently, according to the EMTs, we had done the right thing not following my dad's advice and just pulling it out then and there. We tried the swiss roll when we got home, it was forking amazing. 

TL;DR On a quest to make my swiss roll pretty, I fork-got that the dishwasher was open and my buns were promptly assaulted by a vengeful utensil

EDIT: I'm a minor so sorry no ass pics but here's some proof: http://imgur.com/qDyMXjo 

EDIT2: wowee this is blowing up I'm happy I'm making u guys laugh :))) and for those asking, the glorious swiss roll: http://imgur.com/TiC3QEE presentation is a little less than top notch but it was damn good. We mashed a couple of recipes together, the cake is lemony and the filling is homemade blackberry jam and cream."
"TIFU by mixing up steam in the bag and boil in the bag rice


I didn't properly check the packaging, assumed it was just a case of microwaving it.

About 4 mins later there's acrid smoke coming from the microwave, my eyes are watering and it's becoming increasingly hard to breathe. I quickly open the window after.

I turn the microwave off and pull out a black mass on a plate. I shove this in the sink and turn the tap on. I then hide in another room until the smokes cleared.

For some fucking reason the inside of the microwave is now orange, even after half an hour of cleaning, but I'm going to give it another go tomorrow .

TL:DR Black mess, orange liquid and smoke inhalation are why you should read packaging properly.

Not sure if anyone will read this, care or if I'm doing this right but ho hum, it won't be my biggest fuck up today.

EDIT:So I wake up to this having blown up.

I will try some of the cleaning methods, hopefully I don't get mustard gassed in the process.

As for getting a steam cooker, the main reason I'm having boil in the bag rice is because my flatmates broke the oven, added to that what they did to the George Foreman another person had, I'm not risking it."
"TIFU by convincing my friend that we should relive our child memories


Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago. Wanted to post it during the weekend to be on the safe side with the rules and then kind of forgot about it...


So it's winter, but my friend and I decide to defy the snow, this beautiful sunny day. We decide to take a walk through the neighborhood where we grew up together, to catch up and talk about life. The usual stuff. As our walk is nearing its end we get to this slope. At the slope you have the option to either go around it or to take your chances walking/running downhill. It's a bit too steep to walk downhill safely. If it's the least bit muddy or icy, it's a guaranteed slip and fall.


This day it's covered in fluffy snow, slowly melting in the sun. So walking down safely is out of the question. My friend is turning right to walk around it. That's when I get this flashback from when we were kids, rolling down the slope, getting all dizzy and laughing uncontrollably. So I say to my friend ""hey, you remember when we used to roll down this hill as kids? Shouldn't we do that again? Wouldn't it be nice to relive that memory?""


My friend is very hesitant but I'm now completely determined to embrace my inner child and get us both rolling down this hill. She's complaining that the snow will soak through our clothes, I argue that we're just a few minutes from home. So after a bit of convincing we reach the decision that I will go first, so I can catch the most of the loose snow and create a path for her to roll in.


So off we go! I throw myself down the hill. Even though rolling down the hill as an adult hurt a bit more than I remembered it did as a child, I laugh loudly all the way down and reach the bottom of the slope unharmed. My friend copies my moves and we both end up just lying in the snow, at the bottom of the slope, laughing uncontrollably. Now you're probably thinking ""how is this a TIFU-story?"", oh just wait...


After collecting ourselves and calming down a bit, the laughter slowly turns to giggles and we decide it's time to get up and get moving. After walking just a few meters I catch a whiff of a very unpleasant smell. By the facial expression of my friend I see that she's smelling it too. ""Maybe the garbage truck just passed by"" I say. As we walk on the nasty smell is still following us and no garbage can is in sight. We start discussing if it might come with the wind from a construction site, where they're messing with sewage system. The smell is still too strong and we can't see any construction going on either.


It finally dawns on us and we're left with no more excuses.

The smell is coming from us.


We look at each other and at first glance we both look perfectly normal. At closer inspection I notice something smeared on my friends shoulder, I sniff it and my stomach drops. Dog poop. We're both completely covered with it. It's smeared from shoe level to shoulder. It's even in my hair!


We both start gagging and realise there's no way to continue this day together, we need to get home and to get sanitised as soon as possible. After picking up the speed, hoping that we won't have to face any other people out walking, we then quickly say goodbye and rush home.

Once at home just getting out of the clothes, without making the mess any worse, was a real challenge. I emptied the bathroom of everything and slowly stepped out of my clothes, coughing and gagging all the time. Leaving the pile of shit stained clothes to deal with later, I stepped into the shower. When I got to cleaning my hair I couldn't keep it in any more and puked over myself, as my fingers tried to get the pieces of poop out of my curly hair.

I still can't believe how the dog poop got all over, there must've been more than one log hiding there under the snow. Most of the clothes I threw away immediately, but I tried to save the jacket. A new winter jacket isn't cheap but no matter how much time I spend cleaning it, I just can't help but gag a bit when I see that jacket.

Tl;dr: went out walking with a friend, I convincing her that we should relive our child memories and roll down a snow covered slope. Under the snow dog poop was hidden and we ended up smeared in poop from top to toe. Puked on myself while trying to clean it up."
"TIFU by not skipping leg day


I am the guy that skips leg day every week... my chicken legs are fragile and don't like punishment. When i went to the gym today i was planning for another upper body workout but last minute decided to do a leg workout. It hurt. My legs were jello and i had trouble walking and even working my gas pedal driving home. I got into a hot shower to easy the pain before laying down to watch a movie before bed. I was feeling better and before bed i had to go clean my cats litter box. I had not cleaned it for 2 days and this 14 pound beast had just push out a torrent of hot ass butter among 2 days worth of land mines. I grabbed my bag and scoop and began to squat down over the box. This was my mistake. My legs quivered once and my mind was racing with ""no no no no"" I knew had lost control. My legs revolted and time slowed down. In slow motion i fell forward and landed in the litter box. My cats recent deposit was still warm and was now on my neck and check. I dry heaved but kept my dinner down. Fuck. Leg. Day. 

TL:DR Didn't skip leg day got covered in my cats ass goo."
"TIFU by trying to use an X-acto knife while wearing new multifocal glasses.


This happened last night at about 11:30. First a little back story: My last eye exam was in 2006 and in the last 11 years apparently my eyes have gone to complete shit. Getting tired of Mister Magooing all over town, squinting to see any distance whatsoever, and having to hold anything I needed to read at an arms length that would make Stretch Armstrong ooze at the armpit with envious corn syrup, I broke down and went in for an eye exam.
  

Turns out I needed trifocals the likes of which I'm pretty sure they use in the Hubble telescope to focus the light from distant galaxies. So, i go and get an eye exam and continued to squint along for the few weeks it took for the new glasses to arrive.
  

The day came and I anxiously opened the glass case to reveal my snazzy new specs. My new glasses are housed in a nice looking frame that kind of mimics my sun glasses. Almost RayBan-ish with a hint of something Adam Savage would have picked out had he not been able to completely focus on his image in the mirror while trying on new frames.
  

Now, if you've never had to adjust to multifocal glasses, let me give you some insight. D'you know that sickening, wavy, room-spinning thing you get when you're about three Long Island Iced Teas over your bodily limit? Well, couple that with the way things look as the tunnel vision sets in just prior to passing out. Yeah, that's what its like every time you turn your head or move your eyes.
  

Until your brain catches up with whats going on, everything is distorted. The keys on your keyboard look like a field of wonky parallelograms, all of the neatly displayed cans in the canned food isle at the grocery store all look to be different sizes, some short and squat, some tall and skinny. It's almost like you're wearing a set of funhouse mirrors on your face. Nausea and headaches become old drinking buddies but most of all your hand-eye coordination flies right out the window.
  

Fast forward to last night - 72 hours in with the new spectacles. I'm a prop builder and motorcycle enthusiast so there's always something on the workbench. So, I'm out in my shop, working on a new project, burning a little midnight oil, getting ready to call it a very long day and going to bed. I was cutting out two circular patterns from some thin leather to use as washers to put under the seat on my bike where it bolts to the fender.
  

Having somewhat adjusted, or so I thought, to the new glasses, I pulled my knife hand away and reached in with the other hand to pick up the freshly cut scrap of dead cow. Now, I had just (I mean not 30 seconds before) replaced the blade with a new one as I had broken the very tip end off the old one and I can not stand a nubbed off blade. That's when it happened. The blade entered the side of my right index finger (yeah, I'm a lefty), at the knuckle with the same ease and effort it would take a samurai sword to cut warm butter.
  

The funny thing about traumatic injuries is that you don't feel them as they're happening. Your brain doesn't have time to fully process the scope of what has just gone down. The blade went into my finger and stopped. Instead of doing what every other normal human being would do, my reaction was to jerk the blade away quickly and violently in an upward and away motion further filleting my digit like a Ginsu knife cutting a soda can.
   

Immediately, blood came gushing out of the wound, covering my hand, the workbench, the leather, the shop floor, the paper towel roll and anything else within spurting distance. I kid you not, it looked like a goddam civil war hospital up in here.
  

Having been a medic during my military service, I applied pressure and elevated to extremity. Now, I'm not the type that passes out over this sort of thing but I had to sit down as I felt the diaphoreses and light headedness wash over me. I started rhythmically breathing to calm the effects and once I felt I could kind of move around, I went to get my wife out of bed in order to drive me to the ER.
  

Enter these damned glasses again. As I went to walk into the house, the waviness of my vision through these new binoculars threw me right back onto the edge of a vomitious, flailing, shakespearian death scene style black out. But, in fine British fashion, I kept a stiff, yet quivering upper lip and made it into the bedroom to fetch my peacefully sleeping, lovely wife.
  

I did a pretty good job of controlling the blood flow but, as the wife was getting dressed, I attempted to clean the wound in the sink by running water over the effected area. Hitchcock himself would have been impressed by the gore circling the drain as the life poured from my somewhat severed yet still attached finger. Okay, maybe not ""severed"" but you couldn't tell it by the amount of red every where. Upon seeing this, the wife's haste in dressing sped to a blur and once again the wash of faintness came flooding back over me.
  

We get to the ER and my makeshift paper towel bandage was doing it's job quite well. Hell, if it weren't for the fact that I was holding my clotted towel, bandaged finger above heart level, you wouldn't have been able to tell there was anything wrong as I had recovered quite nicely from my near fainting episode. I get checked in and prepared to set there and wait it out as I am quite familiar with ER wait times.
  

You never realize how much you rely on two hands until one of them is occupied and you have to fumble around trying to do even the simplest things you never knew you needed two hands to do. I must have fumbled and almost dropped my phone three times. All I could think was if I drop this onto the ER waiting room floor I would need to autoclave the sick people funk off my iPhone. As I pondered what would happen to electronics in a hot, wet vacuum the ER nurse called me back into the exam area in record time.
  

The doctor came into the exam room and nonchalantly plotted his approach to reattaching the flap I had created in my once perfect finger. As thoughts of never being able to play the piano again and having to pull my name from the extensive list of the world's hand models, he began to suture my knuckle back in to some semblance of normalcy.
  

As the second suture was being inserted, my old friend, Passy Outty came poking his head into the room to remind me that I was a clumsy, fallible, blind, oaf who had no business using sharp objects while adjusting to new trifocal glasses. This time his appearance made it so I had to lay down as any and all remaining notions of my manliness exited my body like a cartoon ghost climbing out of a body and floating up toward the heavens.
  

Laughing at my clumsiness, my wife then drove me home and went back to bed. Once all the excitement of the evening began to wash away, I rewarded myself with a midnight snack and went out to the shop to clean up the crime scene and finish what I had started.

TL;DR TIFU by hacking into my flesh with an X-acto because my new glasses are screwing with my coordination."
