"TIFU by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the Atlantic Ocean on an international flight.


I was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from Delhi to London, so I quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as I ran to the boarding gate.

About 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the TVs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

I can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

After a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

As it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. They're also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I'd grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

And **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.


**

TL;DR: I made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. Everyone lost their minds."
"TIFU by punching my boss


Our office is set up really strange and to get to the women's restroom you have to walk through a large dimly lit storage area and pass through a couple of doors. I had just finished washing my hands and turned to reach for the door to leave. Suddenly the door was flung open and scared the ever loving shit out of me. I guess my fight or flight chose fight because the next thing I know I'm wildly swinging a right hook. I punched my boss, who was dressed as a witch for Halloween, in the jaw/neck as we screamed at each other.

We've now had two ""safety meetings"" about preventing future incidents, they've made laminated signs and taped them to the bathroom door that say ""Please open SLOWLY"" and every woman in the office now announces themselves every time they come in or out of the office. I got a verbal warning from HR and I'm now too afraid to use the office restroom because I don't know if I can be trusted when startled. I sat through a meeting about it dressed as a bumble bee and trying to not laugh and cry at the same time.

Edit: I'm a female. Boss is female.

Edit Edit: Boss was also dressed like a witch for Halloween."

"TIFU by pretending to be a mannequin


Like so many others this didn't happen yesterday, but a few years ago when I was in college.  
  
I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear.  All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat.  Not a single piece of skin was showing.  I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window.  This is where the FU happens.  I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange.  For the most part people aren't noticing me.  Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right.  That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger.  He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working.  
  
A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms.  The older fellow was black too.  He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist.  He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people.  
  
TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin.  Scared a little kid who happened to be black.  Got called a racist."
"TIFU when I made my Uber driver have an existential crisis.


This happen to me about an hour ago. My car broke down and had to call Uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I'm going to change the name of my job and the people I'm speaking of.)*

UD: ""Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?""

Me: ""It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.""

UD: ""Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?""

Me: ""Yeah man. I get you.""

UD: ""I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.""

Me: ""I'm glad to hear that. What is his name?""

UD: ""My boy Frank.""

Me: ""Frank...Gallagher?""

UD: ""Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.""

Me: ""Um..When was the last time you talked to him?""

UD: ""Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I'm going to hit him up soon.""

Me: ""I don't know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.""

UD: "".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.""

Me: ""I've been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.""

UD: ""No, he didn't. I'm going to call him right now because I'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.""

**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**

UD: ""He probably didn't pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha""

Me: ""Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.""

UD: ""He wasn't some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...""

Me: ""or early 50's? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I've ever trained. He died, man. I'm really sorry you found out like this.""

**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**

UD: ""I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!""

Me: ""I'm sorry...I don't know what to say"" *looks at the clock on my phone*

UD: ""He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40's bruh.*

He eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.

**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together. 
 
**Edit** name and grammar

**UPDATE** This has really blown up. I didn't expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages I received that say ""Kill Yourself asshole"" or ""Scum for doing that to a person"". [I screenshot'd the text message between the Uber Driver and I.](http://imgur.com/gallery/ErXBP) Wasn't mean or anything, he just wanted me to be certain about ""Frank"". "
"TIFU by not opening my Reddit Secret Santa gift for months...


This happened two Christmas's ago and I want to remind everyone to make sure to open your gifts fully. 

So I have done Reddit's Secret Santa exchange the past few years. The first 3 years tried it, I sent my gifts and had got nothing back in return. I was on my final straw with the exchange and because I was putting a good effort in my gifts, I wanted something cool in exchange. 

I made my bio on the Secret Santa page and showed all my interests. I talked about my dog, how much I love soccer and all sports, my favorite teams, and other hobbies. I was hoping this would be the year...Well about a week before Christmas, I get a package that has written in sharpie all over it, ""REDDIT SECRET SANTA!!!!"" 
I was stoked to say the least. My roommates gathered around to see what was in the box...an electric toothbrush still sealed in the box(looked like this http://i.imgur.com/bcrSJ22.jpg). I was so bummed. My roommates laughed, I laughed (but was a little mad). I said something along the lines of, ""I guess when my toothbrush breaks I can use this one.""

About 5 months go by and Im using my old electric toothbrush and it suddenly breaks. My Secret Santa gift will now come in handy! I go into my closet and pull out the box. I cut the tape and inside is not an electric toothbrush....It's a hand painted mug with two of my favorite soccer teams badges. I started laughing and was pumped! I felt like a fool for not even opening the box for months. It was one of the best gifts I have received in a long time and I use this mug almost every day for my beer, chocolate milk, water. 

So thank you random Secret Santa Redditor. I will continue to do Secret Santa because of you! 

http://imgur.com/a/UetSS

TL;DR: Thought I got an electric toothbrush for my Secret Santa gift...turned out to be an awesome hand painted mug with my favorite soccer teams.  

edit: picture links

Edit 2: if my secret Santa sees this , thanks again!!!

edit 3: I got my toothbrush replaced, costco warranties. Maybe I picked the wrong picture for the box. I dont think it was a limited edition toothbrush. just a normal oral b toothbrush. 

edit 4: I can't believe people thought a puppy was in the box...and for the people who wanted to see my dog http://i.imgur.com/7i6zJXl.jpg

Edit 5: OH its the same mug! Liverpool on one side, Inter on the other. "
"TIFU by using my gaming laptop for 4 years... with the wrong graphics card


I'm just speechless at this point. I always thought I know a bit about pc's, and people usually went to me first when they wanted to have their own fixed.

When I bought my gaming laptop 4 years ago, it wasn't absolutely topnotch, but a rather good setup. Costum built, ~2000$ XMG laptop, i7 3630QM, Geforce GTX 660M etc. Mediocre today, but quite good a few years ago.


Now I always wondered why I could play many games only on low setting, if at all. Like Witcher 3 was basically a diashow, gta 5 only on the lowest settings etc and today I bought Skyrim SE. I used to play the original one but since it was a bit laggy I just played the main story and quit.

Now I start the game, and set everything to super low... and 10FPS.

Dafuck I think, look up the requirements:

&gt;CPU:	Intel Core i5-750/AMD Phenom II X4-945
CPU Speed:	Info
RAM:	8 GB
OS:	Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit Version)
Video Card:	NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 1GB /AMD Radeon HD 7870 2GB

Comon, thats way worse than what my old gaming buddy has. I always had a thought that my laptop would use its integrated graphics, but why would it (Intel HD Graphics 4000)? I check the Nvidea control center and it says 0 supported games. After updating, it found a few games, but still, laggy as hell.

Now at this point I discovered the Nvidea control panel, or rather clicked around it - and then I saw that for whatever reason, almost all my games with the exception of League Of Legends and Stardew Valley where using my integrated graphics card instead of my Geforce.

For four years I played games with my integrated graphics card.

I just can't get over my stupidity at this point. Btw, Skyrim SE runs now at a mix of Mid/High settings @ 60FPS..."
"TIFU by making my wife seem like a heartless bitch to all of the people she works with.


So last night we had a conference for my wife's work. It was for a charitable foundation for children with physical disabilities. The presentation itself was an hour and a half long using Powerpoint. They trotted out the kids one by one and tried to guilt you into the inevitable when they asked for money at the end. Seriously the only thing missing was Sarah McLachlan singing ""In the Arms of an Angel"". It was just like that but with kids instead of animals.

So I was bored silly and texting my son in the Army. When I told him an hour and a half of Powerpoint he commiserated and said, ""Yup. That's every damned meeting for me!"" I showed this to my wife and she want, ""Ha!"" out loud.

Now, at that very time they were talking about another poor little kid. So it went something like this:

&gt; Presenter: This little guy was born with all of his organs on the outside instead of on the inside.
&gt; 
&gt; Wife: Ha!

Then she looked up from the text to see people in a three table radius staring at her."
"TIFU by destroying my Aunt's entire Swarovski Crystal collection


This happened over a decade ago when I was around 9.

My siblings, cousins and I were playing hide-and-go-seek in my Aunt's fairly large living room, while the adults were doing their boring adult thing at the table along one of the walls. You know when you've played hide-and-go-seek a million times in the same house, yet by a stroke of imagination you manage to find that new spot that nobody's ever found before? Well this time, I had found it. It was the short circular table that supported my Aunt's Swarovski crystal collection. You know, the one with about 75 pieces that she's been collecting her entire life? The house's centrepiece? The one where friends would surprise her with a new thousand-dollar item every so often for decades?

Anyways. I felt like a genius for finding the spot. The table's cloth perfectly covered the table's legs. Genius. This was real estate that De Beers would be proud of. The only problem was that there was just so little room under there. So while my brother counted to 20, which probably happened over the course of a couple seconds, I scrambled under the Swarovski-ladden table and held my breath.

""20!"" And the hunt began. From one corner of the room, I hear ""No! Darn it!"" Oh, there goes Christina. From behind the piano, you could hear a dissatisfied rumbling from Gary. Amateur. Entire seconds passed in the blink of an eye. When suddenly somebody – my brother! – grabbed my foot, which was neatly protruding from beyond the table's hanging cloth. ""Gotcha!"" he cried.

That's when I decided to scare him by springing up with all my might. Except I was beneath the table, which required extra might. And that's when it happened. Before I knew it, I heard a loud crash on the floor behind me. Turning around, I saw it: all those crystal bears, elephants, monkeys, and other animals, destroyed. Some were decapitated; others suffered much more gruesome fates. Perhaps a few Siamese kittens survived; I forget. I pouted up to notice the parents mid-gasp. My aunt looked shocked and angry. I turned to my cousins – but the alibis disappeared! So I did what was natural, racing to the couch where I buried my face, crying, in the cushioniest corner, away from the world.

What would you do if some pesky kid accidentally ruins your life passion?

Well after 15 minutes of me sulking, my aunt sat down next to me. Perfect calm. And she told me this story:

""Once I was a dinner guest at a friend's house. We had a very lovely meal and a great time. But when it was time to go, I started walking out, and when I did, my foot fell right through their hallway floor! I was so embarrassed! Their floor was broken! My friends were looking at me with such disapproval and I didn't know what to say. I had ruined their home. I just felt like crying... I know exactly how you feel. And it's okay.""

She was an incredibly strong woman. Passed away some years later. May she rest in peace.

--
**TL;DR** Playing hide-and-go-seek when I was 9. Destroyed Aunt's entire Swarovski collection by jumping out from under the table that supported it. She showed tremendous grace in comforting me."

"TIFU by using lube NSFW


Actually happened today. My wife and I had decided to have some fun relation times. We normally keep our happy fun time juice on the stand next to our bed, (no kids) so I reach for it and proceed. After the deed was done, I noticed I was feeling some odd tickling near my no-no zone. Looked down and saw an ant crawling around.

Now I'm all down for third partners, but this guy just shoved his way in. I disposed of it, only to have a brief moment of insight. The ants that are very common to this area are obsessed with sweets. I glance over at the bottle, and sure enough, ant orgy.

I then realize that they are most likely all up in my SO.

Shit. 

She's currently in the shower while I type this.

Tldr: used ant covered lube for sexy times with wife.

Edit (Update): Wife is still pretty grossed out, but she appears to have gotten them all. We estimate about 15 or so. She at least finds it funny."
"TIFU by lying to my boss and getting fingered by a doctor infront of my mom


 TIFU

hi reddit im gonna use a throwaway for this, im 30 so this happened 14 years ago but i can remember it like it was yesterday. this is an xpost from /r/askreddit about the stupidest reason you had a doctors visit you can find the first post in my history. here goes.

TIFU

I was 16 hung over and working at Burger King, I was supposed to open the next morning (Sunday) which meant I had to be there by 5:45 to clock in at 6 so we could open at 7. I was up partying the night before lost track of time and left the part at 4:30 in time to get home get a shower and leave for work. 

It's now 7:30am I'm in drive thru drunk as shit trying not to sleep and/or puke. Finally I take the headset off tell the manager in not feeling good and go to the bathroom. I sit on the toilet for what feels like hours but ended up only being 5 minutes. I come out of the bathroom take a ketchup packet and smear some of it into the palm of my hand and a little on my finger tips so it gives them a red after effect. I go to my manager pull her aside and tell her my stomached been in knots all morning show her my hand and tell her i was just shitting blood. This scares the woman beyond reason and she tells me to clock out. 

I go sit for a few minutes and wait for the next bus when my mother shows up crying. The manager called my mother who was my emergency contact. My mother who left her job is now standing in front of me crying asks me if I'm ok. Now I have two choices in front of me either tell the truth and let her rain holy wrath down upon me as only an angry mother could at their drunk lying 16 year old trying to get out of a hard days work. Or I can play along. 

20 minutes later I find myself in the emergency room explaining to the nurse how I was just oozing blood out of my asshole at Burger King. They rush me in to a bed and strip me naked. Sooner than I hoped this old Indian man is in my room with a rubber glove snapping into his hand looking at me, I'm stark naked bare this little hospital dress they put on me, he rolls me onto my side and sticks his finger into my brown abyss. He's poking around reaching like a child would a vending machine that ate his last quarter. He asked me if I have had any sexual activity in my bum because he can feel some tearing ( what a fucking bullshitter this doctor is I didn't bleed out of my ass) and it can usually be caused by anal penetration. I deny it my mom looks worried he gives me a note for the day off I get dressed we get to the car and the drive home is quick. 

Before we pull in to the driveway my mom asks me If im OK and how my butt feels. I tell her it's sore and she told me that's what the fuck I deserve for lying to her about drinking the night before. She knew... What a bitch.


im unsure when she figured out i was lying, it had to be after she picked me up tho because her hysterics were real when she arrived.


TL:DR
i was drunk wanted 2 leave work lied to my boss about shitting blood, my mother was called took me to the hospital and let a doctor anally probe me when she knew i was lying.

Edit:formatting
Edit2: I am a man since I didn't state it clearly."
"TIFU by wiping s*** on my face and not noticing until my wife pointed it out.


So I'll give a bit of background; I've been sick for the past few days and had my nose clogged for about 3 by now. Being the weekend, I stayed home and tried to get better. Often times I would find myself in front of the tv, with some tea and tissues. 

Last night, at around 1:00 in the morning, I woke up to use the bathroom. My wife was asleep so I tried being quiet. Half asleep, I groggily walked over to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet. 

I did my business and got up to wipe. While up, I thought might as well blow my nose, and clear my clogged nostrils. Being that I was full of NyQuil, and just got up, I hadn't noticed I used the same piece of toilet paper.  

The same....piece....of TP!!! (Pause to imagine previously described s##tuation). 

Simply put, I went back to bed and having a clogged nose (still), hadn't noticed the aroma, propagating in front of my face. 

My wife woke me a few minutes after the incident. If I recall her words correctly, it was something along the lines of, 'What smells like s###? Wait is that you? WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE S### MARK?!?'

After realizing the horror of the situation, I went to in the mirror expecting a huge glob of human product on my face. 

Having wiped more than once, I didn't have much on my face, but when my sense of scent returned I noticed a prominent stank that made me dry-heave a bit. 

I washed the smell off returned to bed but had trouble sleeping over the sound of snickers coming from the left side of the bed. 

TL;DR 
•clogged nose 
•had to s###
• wiped, then blew my 
nose with s### covered TP


Edit: too clear up some confusion, I do in fact wipe standing since that's how I was taught. 

Edit 2: I also do sleep on the right side of the bed, for which difference it makes I had no knowledge of. 

Edit 3: I'm also not afraid to curse, I just don't like to read at work and see me boss read curse words over my shoulder. 

Edit 4: I also did wash my hands. I forgot to mention.

"TIFU by trying to deep-fry a partially frozen turkey


**As per usual -  This happened 15+ years ago**

So I'll start off by saying a couple of things; first I am a Canadian and secondly I love outdoor cooking.  Don't care if it's grilling, smoking, BBQ'ing - I love it all!

So being from Canada, pre-food channel days, I was not afforded the luxuries of TV tutorials on the do's and don'ts of deep frying a turkey.  Hell, we still didn't have a decent outdoor shop in my town where I could buy a turkey fryer.  To say I didn't know what I was doing is an understatement. 

Off to eBay I go, and find a decent set up, pot, fryer basket, lifter, burner, thermometer- everything I need.  So I pay up and a couple weeks later my new purchase comes in the mail.  My wife and I host a yearly BBQ and I thought it would be the ideal time to try out my new toy.

So, day before the BBQ, I go out and buy a turkey from the store - still completely frozen.  I throw it in the fridge with my naivety kicking in and telling me it'll be thawed by tomorrow.  So the big day comes and I position the burner in our back lane (right by both our cars), and proceed to begin heating up 17L of oil.  Now, I did what I could looking up things on the internet (this was 2001 and not a lot was around back then), and did the volume of oil check with the turkey to make sure the oil wouldn't pour over the top when I put in the bird.  

Finally, with my guests arriving and sitting in my back yard watching me, the oil temperature gets up to 400 degrees F.  I go get the bird, drop it into the fry basket, hook on the handle and just drop it in all at once.

Holy. Shit.

Now I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, and somehow my brain failed to process the most basic of cooking instructions:

Oil + Water do not work well together.

The instant the still frozen parts hit the oil, the water changed to steam and created what I can only describe as a geyser of canola oil shooting out of the turkey neck hole 10 feet in the air, and raining down on me and my vehicles.

So here I am, screaming in pain as blisters develop on my face, arms and legs, oil peeling paint off our cars, and a backyard of friends witnessing this horror.

Then shit went south...........

The Pot of oil burst into flames fueled by the burner and stupidity.  I'm losing my shit at this point and determine the best course of action is to kick the pot of flaming oil over into my back lane.....and as I did so I watched burning oil flow down my lane and go directly into the sewer system.

Needless to say, the turkey was ruined, I was taken to the hospital with 2nd and 3rd degree burns, the paint on my cars peeled, and all the time my friends watched this debacle take place.

tl;dr - Tried deep frying a frozen turkey, was burnt by a geyser of boiling oil, destroyed my cars, and lit my back lane on fire.

Edit 1: Well went to bed after a night shift woke up to this. Thanks for asking how I am.  I'm not all Freddy Krueger'd up just some scarring on my arms and back of my neck but for the most part it's ok - remember I live in Canada, free health care. It had rained the night before, so there was water in the back lane which either helped the lake of fire flow so nicely but likely extinguished it upon entering our storm sewer system. I don't have any pictures of the aftermath but I wish I did 😓

I've done dozens of turkeys since then. One stupid mishap should stop you from doing something. Obviously you learn pretty quick the don't so the do's come pretty easy after. 

If you want to deep fry, use peanut oil if you can find it (I can't usually and when I do find it its well over $100 to buy it). Peanut oil imparts a nice taste whereas canola oil (my go to) just frys shit. Once turkey is thawed for a couple of days (check it) you can inject it with seasoning or brine it the day before. I do both. Pat it dry then take melted butter and baste the skin. Put some seasoning on the skin and set bird aside. Get oil up to 400 degree F (the temp will drop once the bird goes in). Put bird in frying basket, and make sure you are wearing a big goddamn glove (I wear welders gloves). Lower bird into oil about two inches then remove, then lower into oil again so bird cooks another 2 inches. Keep doing this till the bird is fully immersed. 3.5 minutes per pound and I guarantee it's one of the greatest things you will ever try. "
"TIFU by telling my Dad I'm atheist, and now i have nowhere else to turn


It's currently 1:30 AM as I'm typing this, when I should be studying for a psychology test. I just decided to make a reddit account like 5 mins ago because no one else in my fucking life will even listen to reason. This might be a long post, so if you don't care to read all this then just skip to the TL;DR at the end.

Okay, so maybe this isn't the right subreddit to put this post, but I don't fucking care. Move this thread if you need to. I apologize. I need a place to express myself. If you're going to continue reading this, all the way through to the end, I just want to thank you. Really. Thanks.

First off, I'm a boy scout, and I'm an atheist. If you know the organization you would know that those two things don't go together very well. That being said, my Dad just found out I'm atheist. Wonderful.

Let me briefly interrupt with research I did. [Here](http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/god-top.html) is a link I found referring to a short history of Boy Scouts concerning atheism, and [here](http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/lambert.html) is a relatively recent example of how the BSA handled one case of an atheist scout. As you can see, if you read them, the BSA takes this situation absolutely seriously. Although the scouts and adult leaders within a troop may protest to the BSA office, it is **extremely** rare for an openly atheist scout to achieve and keep the rank. Please keep that in mind.

Early this afternoon, after I got home from school, my Dad decided to talk to me about religion. Who the hell knows why. ""Son, I'd like to talk to you about God."" What the hell? Why now? ""Do you believe in a God?"" I hesitated. He's a good observer. He's seen how I am apathetic to anything in the family regarding religion, and how I seem to deliberately avoid them at all costs. ""No, not really. I don't really have a reason to believe in one."" [Here's](http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/Venturing/About/welcome.aspx) why I didn't just lie to him. That was my fuck up, if you're looking for one. I should've just lied to his face, and none of this would've ever happened. I've been a scout since kindergarten, and I respect the majority of these rules. Whenever it comes to saying the pledge of allegiance or the scout oath (above) out loud, I always leave out God. Been doing it since ninth grade. Additionally, for the scout law (above) it says that scouts should be ""reverent."" Ironic. This word can also be extended to mean revering and respecting others' opinions. What fucking hypocrites. I don't criticize them for believing in God. Believe whatever you want, just don't let it affect someone else. Anyway, my father said that it's probably not worth all the effort to go through my eagle project and every merit badge anymore since they wont accept me anyway. Great. Fucking great.

Sure, I could always try to do the project on my own or with another adult, buy you need to understand that I actually have a life outside of scouting. I am a 4.0+ GPA student, and I have been commended for being a runner-up finalist to the National Merit Scholarship, or something like that. Big deal. My point is that I have 4-8 hours of homework every day, and that it is highly, and I mean HIGHLY, inconvenient to go to some other location to do work. I will easily run out of time and stay up until 3 AM again doing some stupid shit like this. Another thing, I know nothing about the Eagle Project process. My Dad's actually done it before with my older sibling, and it turned out great. He's also said in the past that he's willing to help me with the project, and I've said that I'm completely willing to put in the work to get this thing done.

""Wait, wait, wait,"" I can hear you saying. ""You've achieved all that shit and you're worried about this? Why worry about what colleges you'll get into? You're already set in school, they gotta acknowledge that."" Right. Good point. That completely invalidates my entire post. Sure, but, over the course of these last 10 hours, this has become something more to me than that. I've learned just how corrupt the BSA is (denying gays, atheists, other people they decide to discriminate against), and I feel the need to prove to my father and to my troop that I can do this. I am a good person, and no sense of a higher power can get in the way.

Another thing. I've already started the project a month ago, and I've told tons of people about it, and the executive director of this one community center has enlisted my help, and I've already agreed to do it. Now, my Dad's basically just telling me to give up, because I'm bound to fail. I've already made the commitment. I am not giving up that easily. And, I have no intention of giving up any time soon.

Unfortunately, it seems that my Dad has already contacted my scoutmaster and forced me to talk with him. He basically said that in the next two weeks I've gotta find a way to believe in God, even if I believe that he/she/it is unlikely to exist. His argument is that I can't prove that he doesn't exist, and that because I admit this, that must mean that there's a 1% or even 0.1% chance of me believing in him, and therefore I've got to listen to that part of me over the other 99% of me. I've thought about this and contemplated this concept for years, and I've come to the conclusion that I do not believe in a God. Although I admit that I can't prove that he exists or doesn't exist, that gives me no less reason to believe what I do. I'm not just going to believe something because other people want me to. I'm going to make my own conclusions, you assholes.

That might just be about everything, so if you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Think about it. Post a comment. Hate me. Support me. I don't care. I really just don't know what to do right now, and I felt that I had to get that off my chest. Yes, boy scouts is a stupid organization at this point, but I can't just give up. I'm not like that. Say whatever the hell you want, now. It's 2:40 AM, and I have school tomorrow. Maybe things'll change. Maybe this post will get downvoted into oblivion by the time I get back from school tomorrow. At least I would have something in my life to look forward to.

TL;DR: I belong to boy scouts, which is a private organization. One of the requirements is that you have a belief in a ""Supreme Being."" I was about to start working on my Eagle Project to achieve the final rank of Eagle. My Dad asked me if I believe in God, I said no, and now he says that he doesn't think i should continue scouting. He's practically the only person who can possibly help me get to Eagle, and now I'm not going to get Eagle. I should have just shut the fuck up and lied to his face. No, I absolutely HAD to do the right thing.



EDIT: Holy crap. This blew up so fast and hit the front page. I can't even believe all the messages I'm getting from you guys. I really didn't expect so much. All I can say is thank you for your support, it means a lot to me ;). I don't really have time to answer questions or respond to the over 1000 messages I've got in the past 20 hours, but I decided to check in for a short time, and holy crap was I blown away. I'll take time to read through some of your messages when the weekend hits, right now I'm busy with schoolwork.




EDIT 2: Okay... It's been two weeks, and I've just finished talking with my scoutmaster and my Dad. My scoutmaster told me what I thought, and after reading all of your comments, I decided to tell the straight truth. I said ""Well, I admit that I can't prove there isn't a God, and I can't prove there is. Does that mean that there is one? Don't know. Does that mean that I believe? It does not."" My scoutmaster asked if I'm still willing to put in all the work for the project, I said yes, even with full knowledge of my potential failure. So he said that I can proceed with the project. HOWEVER my Dad decided to step in tonight after talking with my scoutmaster about what I said... He basically said that he is unwilling to help me if I am not going to achieve the rank. I called BS on this. You don't try things in life because you know you will succeed. You try things because you gain value out of the experience. And at this point, I want nothing more than to show him that he's wrong. I also said he stepped across the line when he introduced the issue to my scoutmaster, and he said ""Do NOT talk to ME that way!"" I reaffirmed what I just said. ""You stepped across the line, and you do not understand the repercussions of your actions."" Then he basically said I need to reevaluate my position in life, and I responded by saying ""Yes, I admit that I have plenty of things to reconsider and think about. But, if you think that you have nothing to reconsider or think over, then I am clearly not the only ignorant one in this room. And I walked out. And I did my homework. And here I am now. If anything else happens I'll update you on what goes on... This just fucking sucks right now."
