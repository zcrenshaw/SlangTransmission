"TIFU by changing the fucking rules.


Good fucking day to you all.

A few days back we decided to change the fucking rules and generate a more ""wholesome"" fucking community by making our bitch-ass posts ""cleaner"" by disallowing vulgar slang. We even went as far as to change the fucking title to ""Today I Fudged Up"" As you could probably fucking tell by now, it was an April Fool's joke. Haha, we totally fucking got you motherfuckers.

&amp;nbsp;

Happy fucking April fools.

"TIFU by drinking an energy drink and almost dying.


This very recently. 

It was my day off, and I usually start my morning by drinking an energy drink and playing some video games. 

So I popped open a Monster drink and sat down to play. 

About 20 minutes later, I started feeling very anxious for no reason. Then all of a sudden, my chest started pounding really hard for no reason. 

I've had panic attacks before, but this was different, it felt like my heart was pounding, AT A RHYTHM IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO. This scared the crap out of me and I thought I might be having an attack or something. I tried breathing slowly, but it wouldn't stop. 

So I drove myself to the hospital. (I know that was really stupid, but understand that by this point I wasn't thinking straight, my brain was losing oxygen and I was in a delirious panic. )

Upon arriving at the ER, I checked in and they immediately rushed me back to a bed, and this is when it got really scary. 

I couldn't really understand what was happening, but I knew I was losing feeling in my limbs and my vision was going dark while nurses crowded around me, and they told me they needed to stop my heart. I cried out terrified, saying I didn't want to die.

I woke up a little while later with a tube in my arm in the same room. The doctor had explained to me that I had a severe super ventricular tachycardia, or in other words, my heart had been beating irregularly and in excess of 230bpm. At that fast of a rate, the blood doesn't have enough time to absorb oxygen, hence the delirium and loss of feeling. So they tried to chemically halt my heart, but that didn't work, so they had to use a cardioversion machine to stop and restart it. 

After talking to the doctor about my diet and personal habits, he summarized that I had been malnourished to the point of having very unbalanced electrolyte levels. 
Electrolytes are basically what allows your nervous system to control your motor function, and having poor electrolyte levels and introducing a strong stimulant made my heart go crazy. 

I haven't touched energy drinks since, and I try really hard to have a balanced diet now. 

tldr: poor diet and energy drink consumption made my heart go crazy, almost killing me. Electrolytes are important kids.

Edit: Holy shit, I was just trying to share a scary experience. I had no idea  this post would blow up so much! 
Umm, thanks I guess, I don't know what to say. 

I agree with those of you saying it wasn't strictly the energy drink that caused this, it was mostly my bad diet depriving me of potassium and phosphates specifically. But the energy drink is the match that lit the tinder I laid out. 

Some are telling me this event is rarely life threatening. 
That may be true, but I will say that some may be confusing what I wrote about with a super atrial tachycardia, which is far less serious than a ventricular tachycardia, which is serious enough that I am not allowed to donate blood or plasma due to me being permanently labeled a saftey risk. This isn't from my knowledge, this is from several doctors who told me so.


I appreciate the well wishes and the concern, I am eating a balanced diet, I exercise daily, and I only have the occasional coffee or tea now, I do not wish to repeat that stupid mistake. 

Edit again:

A lot of people have been asking what my diet was like before this happened.

It wasn't so much to do with what I was eating, but that I wasn't eating enough, I work very long hours and I usually only spared myself the time to have one good meal a day, usually something my wife cooked at home. The doctor said that because I wasn't eating frequently enough my body wasn't able to build up enough potassium and phosphorus to keep my system stable. The long periods of fasting coupled with long strenuous hours of working severely depleted my electrolytes. 

So the lesson is that you should not only eat a balanced diet, but also eat regularly. 

Edit x3: First time Reddit gold!! Thank you kind stranger! 
All I had to do was nearly kill myself from shitty habits.

"TIFU by expressing my dog's anal glands


I took my dog to see the vet recently. One of my concerns was that the dog was scooting his ass on our doormat. The good doctor educated me: dogs have two small sacs near their anus. These sacs are filled with stinky liquid that dogs use when marking places. As turds get passed, the glands get squeezed, pushing out some of this liquid and letting other dogs know that they've been there. Occasionally, these glands can get impacted, so it is good practice to clear them out every now and again. The dog will scoot his ass on the carpet to relieve the itch.

Now the good doctor showed me how to do it - WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING IT. That happened in the back, presumably done by the vet tech.

Fast forward to earlier in the week, when I noticed the dog scooting. So I got some nitrile gloves, and a paper towel and ""expressed the gland"". With just a gentle squeeze, the most vile liquid I could ever conceive of squirted onto my face and shirt. I cannot explain just how vile it was. Words do not do it justice.

Have you seen those beached whales who die and then their corpses explode from the trapped gases? I would rather eat what's left behind of the whale than smell this again.
I have showered several times and I still smell it. I have done nasal rinses twice and I still smell it. I threw away the shirt, but its in my garage. It can be smelled through 
the garbage bag in my garage.

TL;DR did some home vet tech work. Never again."
"TIFU by almost getting run over by a car trying to hide my junk from my sister.


So I'll bet the title has you a bit confused so I'll get right to it. I'm 15 and my sister is 17. Every spring we celebrate the departure of cold weather with water balloon fights. It recently got pretty warm where I'm at meaning it was time for us to go at it again. 

This all happened three days ago. We filled up the water balloons and were in our bathing suits outside and we started throwing them at each other. We had been at it for maybe ten minutes, and my sister had a good fifteen water balloons left when I had already ran out. She started pegging me, and I ran away from her which happened to be towards the street. We were in our backyard which is filled with trees. I was running away from her and my swim trunks got caught on a sharp branch sticking out from a tree and they tore straight off. 

Now idk about other guys, but I don't wear boxers under my swim trunks (the netting basically serves as the same thing) so there I was butt naked in my backyard. I went into full-on panic mode, not thinking at all, and I ran to the street away from her trying to cover myself in hopes that she didn't see anything.  My plan was to get across the street and into the tall grass (there's an empty lot on the other side of the street) and wait there for her to toss me something to wear. This is where it all went even more south.

As I was running I heard my sister scream my name. I stopped to look back at her when I realized there was a truck coming down the road. I immediately dove back into our yard and my leg got clipped by the bull-bar on the front of the truck. I also managed to smack my head on the ground pretty hard. The next thing I knew my sister was standing over me very worried, and when I opened my eyes she was relieved. She told me to stay put, got my torn trunks from the tree branch, and then covered my privates and helped me up. I couldn't hardly stand even on my healthy leg, and she ended up basically supporting all my weight over her shoulder while covering me at the same time. Once we got inside she laid me on the couch and got a towel for me to cover myself with, and then called my parents. They were both at work so my sister got me some clothes, helped me to her car, and took me to the hospital where my parents met up with us. I ended up having a fractured shin and a concussion. 

I was lucky my sister saw the truck, because in the split second I looked at it I saw the girl driving was on her phone and not paying attention, and had no idea I was even there. I'm lucky that my sister is amazing because she basically saved my butt in this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: I was having a water balloon fight with my sister, my trunks got torn by a tree, I ran to hide my junk from my sister and ended up running into the street with a truck coming, and my sister got my attention so that I had enough time to get out of the road, and the truck clipped me leaving me with a concussion and a fractured shin. And in the end my sister ended up seeing my junk anyways so it was all to no avail. 

EDIT: I'm going to ask you all to please stop with the ""pegging"" and ""going at it"" comments. I used poor word choice and tbh the jokes are becoming pretty stale. But feel free to make one if you feel you have to. "
"TIFU by submitting porn for my religion assignment


EDIT: It was gay porn. Just when you thought it couldn't be worse...

So every second term in my high school, we have to submit an assignment for religious studies (and often other subjects, but consistently religion). This term, it was a pretty large task involving multiple text documents, mp3s and movies. I won't bore you with the specifics, but I had the idea to use a folder to keep all my progress together and eventually submit. At the same time, I had no laptop and needed a space to store porn because our bandwidth was low (I had to recycle videos a bit. I'm a teenager, going without is not a possibility.).

My family's computer used one account because my father was convinced multiple would use up too much data (sigh), so I decided I would store everything in a folder in the religion folder- who would check there for juicy stuff, right? Of course, I would take it out before I submitted it online.

Today, when I got my marks back and saw a 0/20, my heart dropped and I knew exactly what happened. My religion teacher pulled me aside at the end of the lesson and told me I was getting detention every week for the rest of the term as punishment for this 'sick joke.' My parents were informed, and our family computer was moved to the TV room; my account was also locked out past 8pm.

TL:DR; Submitted a folder that coincidentally also contained porn for a religion assignment, got a term of detention.

UPDATE: For clarification, during the period from submission to getting my marks back I ended up creating new accounts for my whole family because my mother was annoyed that stuff I downloaded (utorrent, etc) was starting up whenever she got on the computer."
"TIFU be ignoring subtle scratching sounds from my would-be attic.


This was in the spring going into summer months. My cousin and I shared a two bedroom apartment on the second floor. This is a private four unit building, probably built in the early 90's or so. It wasn't fancy but it was nice for us. 

Occasionally we'd hear these little scratching sounds in the attic (which was inaccessible). Never really thinking too much of it, we never had an issue with pests of any kind. So we wrote it off as maybe a bird or a chipmunk. AGAIN it's not like we'd hear it all the time and only if it was quiet. 

It progressively got worse but now we knew where the sound was coming from, you could hear it coming from one spot in his bedroom, the corner. Again, being young and naive and not really caring- because it really wasn't a bother, we ignored it. Maybe once debating whether or not to tell the landlord. We didn't want to be THOSE people. After all it really was a very gentle sound, maybe it's the building because it's old I don't know. 

On a warm Tuesday morning we both get up and head off to work. He closes his bedroom door because I recently got a puppy and he didn't want him to wreak havoc in his room. 

So now it's about 330pm and we both arrive home surprisingly at about the same time, to look up at a window that is covered in wasps. Clearly on the inside. 

Holy- fuck. My dog. The dog was fine, he had his door shut, and us having carpet it was a perfect seal- no access out of the room for the angry mob of wasps. 

Turns out this nest was probably years in the making because it weighed enough to eventually come crashing through the Sheetrock while we were at work,  exploding on his bed and letting out thousands and I mean thousands of miniature raging serial killers. 

I am not kidding when I say thousands. You could hear the buzzing when we went into the apartment, from the foyer. Thank Jesus his heat duct was closed too for whatever reason, maybe luck who knows. 

Don't ignore sounds coming from your attic, albeit how small they are. Imagine if he was asleep and this happened in the middle of the night?!

TL;DR I fucked up by ignoring little sounds upstairs and it resulted in a mammoth size wasp nest to come crashing through the ceiling and exploding in a bedroom releasing thousands of wasps. 

Edit: we called our landlord and they sent exterminators over to bomb. It was a mess in the room. They also sealed the hole with new sheet rock. 

Edit 2: so the title is definitely supposed to say ""by"" not ""be"" the iPhone auto correct is disabling. 

Edit 3: I wrote this in comments but I feel like I have to say it. People are saying the tenant is at fault for not reporting such and such and they should be held liable. Do you know how quiet god damn WASP FOOTSTEPS are? Probably not because you've never been close enough. Sorry had to say it. should be liable. 

Edit 4: vacuuming sounded like sucking up confetti. Thick chunks of confetti of death. 

Edit 5: SO I DIDNT POST THIS BEFORE thinking it'd make this story way too long and blah blah. My mom (who is deathly allergic to bee stings) had lived in Texas for the past year and a half and moved back to upstate NY (guilderland) during this time. She popped over and decided to stay the night (my cousin and I arranged) I always think if maybe she was there - she left probably a couple hours before the crash. But would I be responsible for my moms death. I don't think I could live with myself. "
"TIFU by thinking 'never mix business with pleasure' didn't apply to me


We stay at these cabins in Oklahoma for vacation that we found on the internet while looking at getting married and figured it was worth the 3 hour drive to give it a try. It exceeded our expectations and fell in love with the place.

Our first visit was 6 days and the older couple that own the place were very pleasant and left us alone unless we needed something. By the end of our stay we ran out of propane and firewood (both specifically stated would be stocked free of charge) and we were shown where it was kept because it's easier if we do it ourselves. I thought that was weird seeing as how I'm paying for this to be done but went along with it anyway and enjoyed the rest of our stay. 

We book again to get away for the weekend and when we show up the owner comes over and shoots the breeze and says he's adding a third cabin and wants to know if I barter. This is where I should have grabbed my better half and ran into the cabin, locked the door and not come out until time to go home. I say yes( I own my own company by the way specializing in remodels doing tiling, flooring and plumbing) and regret it to this very second. All he needed was for me to run the sewer and water lines under the cabin in return for 7 free nights stay since he can't get underneath them very well anymore. I repeated...all you want me to do is the plumbing UNDER the cabin. Period. Nothing more? Answer was yes,  I need your young legs and specialized tools for the work needing done UNDER the cabin. My better half repeated...so all he has to do is the plumbing UNDER the cabin for our free nights and he promptly told her yes. His wife shows up and all of this is repeated again and to be sure I say...you only want the plumbing UNDER the cabin done and you'll do everything else because driving my work truck would be expensive if you want more than that done to which he says yes but like he's clearly getting frustrated with me repeating my question and I say good enough. We run out of propane halfway through our steaks, I try getting a hold of them to which there is no answer, steaks ruined and I should have taken that as a sign. I didn't. I wish I had. Did I tell you I didn't? Because I didn't. 

We come back so I can do the work and the world goes to poop. He has contractors there working so I can't get my plumbing stubbed through the floor so I run my trunk lines underneath figuring I'll be able to get in the cabin. Nope. They are there all day. I'm wondering why I'm there at all. This guy wouldn't waste my time on purpose would he? Now he is telling me where the shower walls are and the toilet and vanity and I'm like that doesn't pertain to me because I'm only doing the underneath stuff. He talks me into installing the shower faucet. Should've said no. We go back home work not done and tell him I'll waste another trip down to finish work. 

Said wasted trip was this last Saturday,  April 1st and I swear this isn't an April Fool's because I wish it was and this didn't happen. We leave at 3:30 am so that I can start working at 7. I'm cruising along and by noon I have my work done and girl him I'm wrapping things up and he hits me with our agreement was you set all the fixtures and put in the countertop and build a wall around the shower base and blah blah blah blah blah a lot more happened but I'm already boring the poop out of you so unnecessarily long story coming to and end is my better half finally lost her mind,  I politely lost my mind,  told them to keep the 7 free nights and that we would never be back. He doesn't care because he got his cabin plumbed for free. Well played old man,  well played. 

TL;DR Where I screwed up was not getting the job in writing before I started and the consequences of my actions led me to end up with nothing including our free week of stays. I learned that money, or the saving of it,  honestly trumps friendships. This experience taught me that displaying all your religious artwork and talking of God doesn't make you a Christian and that in my experiences I should trust you less. I learned that all of this makes me sad that the days of taking a man at his word and a handshake sealing a deal are gone. Oh well,  the joke's on me, right?"
"TIFU by finding gold flakes.


Tuesday night I helped a friend do some engine work.  When we got done, the car ran fine.  Wednesday morning his car died on the way to work.  Wednesday night, I noticed my wedding ring was missing.  I never take it off and rarely fiddle with it, so  i wasnt sure when I lost it.  *Queue sinking feeling*  Today I got a chance to look at the car engine.  When I opened up the intake manifold, the inside was covered with pretty gold glitter.  I'm sure my ring slipped off, got sealed up in the manifold and made its way down to destroy the valve seats and cylinder wall.  The engine is shot, and my ring is reduced to dust.  I did the right thing and bought the car for fair (running) value.  I'm thankful it was a high milage clunker.  At least I know what happened to my ring.

tldr:  don't wear rings when working on engine internals.

edit1:  Thank you for the gold, the kind words, and the advice!"
"TIFU by trying to replicate a local supernatural phenomenon and almost getting killed.


Where I live there is something called the Spooklight. Many towns ""have them"".  Basically people think it is a light that will show up on certain nights in the country outside of town. People have pinpointed its prime location to a road, known as ""spooklight road."" No joke, that is what everyone calls this road. The road comes to a dead end down by the river, and on this dead end lives an angry old man who doesn't believe in the spooklight. Thinking about it now he probably is just pissed off because so many people drive down there to look for the light every weekend. Anyway, me and my friend were at a party when we got the idea to go ""spooklighting"". (We hadn't been drinking) So we head to the dead end of the road, and park his truck. After about 30 minutes of waiting for the spooklight to appear we got an even better: we would get a flashlight out of his truck, run around in the woods, and pretend to be the spooklight and prank people. So after the around quarter mile walk back to his truck, we grabbed the flashlight and went in the woods behind this guy's house. We started running around, shining the flashlight towards the road to see if we could scare anyone. During all this fun, we hadn't realized that the guy was standing where his yard ends and the tree line begins, watching us. With a gun in his hands. He didn't begin with a warning yell or anything. He fired right at us. I know this will sound cliche, but where I'm from people don't fire warning shots. We have the make my day law, which states if someone is trespassing on your property, you are fully in the right to blow their head off if you want. I've always found it to be a little harsh, but the law is the law. Anyway, back to the first shot. I was frozen in fear, but my friend hit the deck really fast. This caused me to believe that he had been shot, so that really scared me. He immediately jumped up and took off sprinting, and I followed suit. This is by far the hardest I have ever ran, and I run track for my school. We hopped in his truck, and he sped so fast out of there. That is BY FAR the most scared I have ever been, and the closest I've been to death as well. Me and my friend vowed to never go back to that damn road. 

Tldr; me and my best friend decided to run around with a flashlight in the woods behind this known angry guy's house, and almost got killed (legally) because of it. "
"TIFU by eating my brothers tooth


Well I should probably explain. Every day I wake up half asleeep and get dressed, take my allergy pills, and eat breakfast before sitting around waiting for the bus. But I decided that I should stay up late watching bundles of youtube videos, so I was a zombie walking around the house. I only got half dressed before walking to the kitchen, and for some reason my brother had lost a tooth that morning, and decided to lay it next to the pills that had been set out. So without looking, and barely awake, I grabbed his tooth and a vitamin pill, and popped it into my mouth. I was fully awake as it was halfway down my throat, but there was no stopping it. My brother had been in the room watching in horror (he's 8) and ran to my dad crying. I ended up being fine, and I never checked my crap for that tooth, but I had to pay up tooth fairy money with my own cash. Well I was feeling pretty nice so I gave him 5 dollars and a bullshit story on how the tooth fairy took it out of me using magic, and that was that. I'm glad I never heard of it again, because my dad isn't the type to do that, and my brother was 8.

TL:DR I ate my 8 year old brothers tooth instead of an allergy pill, and paid him my own money.


Edit: thanks everyone for the upvotes, I wasn't expecting this much popularity!"
"TIFU by performing CPR on my Dad...


Back story: I live with my mom and go to university while staying at her house. My dad lives in Arizona and I decided to visit him while on Spring Break.

I was watching TV (local news) with my pap and he decided to take a small nap. Me, being the loser I am, decide to go and watch some YouTube in the other room. My dad typically snores loudly throughout​ the house and proceeded to do so as he fell asleep.

After about an hour of videos I decide to see if my pap was awake yet and wanted to play some Rocket League. Although, everything was silent except the TV playing some random law show. I was curious to see why he wasn't snoring, so I closed the door loudly to see if he woke up. No response. I called his name. No response. At this point I'm freaking out wondering if he's deaf in both ears (he's deaf in his right ear) or dead.

As the CPR certified person I am, I go and start the usual steps. Check response, breathing, and pulse. He didn't respond, wasn't breathing, but he had a slight pulse. So I jumped up ran to get my phone downstairs, but as I was running my sock slipped on the carpet stairs and I fell face first. I screamed in agony, but continued on, for my dad's life was on the line. I grabbed my phone and a shirt in my dirty hamper to stop the bleeding coming from my head.

I called 911, moved my dad, and started CPR. I pushed and his sternum cracked just like they tell you in CPR class. As soon as it broke he woke up and screamed at me asking what I was doing. I had never been more scared in my life. The person I was just trying to perform CPR on woke up and yelled at me for doing so.

Eventually, first responders came and I got stitched up above my eyebrow. They took my pap in for x-rays and he just needs to wear a brace for a couple weeks. I also broke a little bone where my eyebrow is. 

Turns out that nothing was wrong  I with my dad's heart or lungs because he just has a sleeping disorder that makes him unable to breathe at points in the night. He now has a respirator to wear just in case. In the end, my dad wasn't mad at me after what happened because he knew I was just trying to help and save his life.

TL;DR: My dad wasn't breathing so ran to call 911, slipped, and cracked my head open. I then performed CPR, broke his sternum, but he woke up and didn't actually need CPR. He just had a sleeping disorder.

Edit: A lot of you are telling me I should have pinched him. In my CPR class I was taught to shake the shoulder and ask if they can hear. So I was kind of freaking out and didn't think about pinching because I had never been taught to. Although I messed up big time by not doing a sternum rub.

Terrible photo​ quality, but [here](http://imgur.com/kce3uRt) is a picture of my eyebrow after falling.

Everything is doing better today, just a black eye and my dad's sore chest. Lots of meds though.

Edit 2: WOW! Had no clue being clumsy got you gold. Thanks, and thank you all who have wished my father good luck. I've enjoyed reading your own personal stories about events related to this."
