"TIFU bu almost jacking myself off to death


Ok so this one happened a few weeks ago now, but it's permanently burned into my brain, So I have an inbuilt defibrillator, that will monitor my heartbeat and shock me if my heartrate raises above 180 BPM, and it plays an important role in my tale.

so, it's 3am and I feel like shit, really bad pain in my lower abdomen, at this point everyone else in my family has gone to bed, so after about 3 hours of suffering, I say fuck it. and decide to go have a shower. and it relieves the pain, though, because I was alone, in the shower, with no-one else awake, I say fuck it, may's well jerk off. and I'm going along and.

BOOM

 I black out. I come to, Scream for my mother (at first I thought I was having a stroke, oh the irony).
Turns out the combo of jackin' it and hot water bought my heart rate up to 217!

BOOM

I black out a 2nd time. my mother rushes into the bathroom and sees me with a raging boner. 

BOOM

I black out once more.
and collapse in the shower.


 my mother wakes me up, and calms me down (turns out being electrocuted tends to increase your heartrate) , as I get continually shocked. and I end up in the ER a 4AM in the morning, having to explain, to my own mother, and 3 female nurses, why my heartrate was so high at 3AM in the shower.



I will never live this down."
"TIFU by underestimating the stupidity of multiple people


Background info: There was a running joke in my schools that I would always be elected to be the Vice-President of student council for my year and bets would be taken on how long it took until I got kicked out for bad behavior.  This started in 5th grade and went all the way until my senior year.  In case people are curious, my ""terms"" ran from literally seconds to about 2 months.  Anyway, this post is from my junior year.

So junior year rolls around and it's time for student council elections.  By now everyone knows I'm going to be elected but because it was fun I still campaigned.  This years campaign consisted of me ""paying"" people to vote for me.  Now this ""money"" I was handing out to people was a black and white print out of a hundred dollar bill with my face badly pasted on using MS Paint.  They were about 50% bigger than a regular bill and also only printed on one side.  Anyway, about 3 days after the election I'm going through the lunch line and I find one of these ""bills"" in my pocket so being a smartass I hand it to the lunch lady at the register fully expecting her to call me an idiot and ask for real money.  Now, the way my schools system worked was you could type in a PIN and electronically charge your lunch to your account.  If you wanted to add money to your account you just gave it to the lunch lady and she would add it.  

So I hand this obviously fake hundred dollar bill to the lunch lady and she asks if I want to put my change on my account.  I sort of stare at her for a minute then say ""Sure"" figuring that she'll realize what's going on when the bill doesn't fit in the compartment in the register.  Nope.  She credits my account and sends me packing.  I think whatever, someone will catch the mistake later in the day and we'll all have a laugh. 

False.

2 days later the assistant principal comes to my 3rd period class flanked by two (2) State Troopers and hauls me out of there. Handcuffs and everything.  It turns out this ""counterfeit"" bill I was passing off made it all the way to the bank for deposit before someone finally said ""Duuurrrrrrr... why is this bill so much bigger and blacker and whiter and one sideder than the other bills?""  Bear in mind at least 3 people other than the lunch lady had touched it and counted it by this time.  

Now, apparently no one had shown the fake bill to the cops so as soon as they saw it they laughed and un-cuffed me.  They told the assistant principal that they were not interested in pursuing this matter any further and that there was absolutely no reason that bill should have ever been mistaken for counterfeit money.  

So the outcome was in school suspension for 3 days, I wasn't allowed to play in the next football game, a huge boost in my street cred for getting taken out of class in handcuffs (I had to start wearing safety glasses to protect my eyes from all the soaking wet panties being thrown at me (I kid)) and obviously I was removed from student council.  My second shortest term.

TL;DR Gave an over-sized monochromatic single sided hundred dollar bill with my face on it to a lunch lady. Lunch lady took it as real cash.  Cue oblivious people being oblivious.  Taken out of class by cops for being a criminal mastermind running a counterfeit operation.

Edit 1: Holy hell this blew up! Also, for some clarification; No, the lunch lady was not disabled. She was just a regular lady who I'm assuming just had zero fucks to give.  We were friendly and had a good laugh afterwards.  I got in school suspension I'm assuming because the assistant principal didn't want to look dumb.  Which really only made him look worse.  Finally, I couldn't find it in my yearbook but I did manage to find one of the originals being used as a bookmark in the yearbook.  So here it is, along with a 100% legal $10 bill for reference.

(Hello darkness my old friend...)

Edit 2:  I didn't bank one the astute eyes of reddit.  I wanted to make myself sound a little older so I pushed back the dates of my FU.  It was a 2006A series hundred dollar bill.  I was a freshman in 2007.  I have brought shame upon my ancestors.

Edit 3: Imgur has no chill so I'm taking down the picture.  We're talking reporting to the Secret Service and shit.  If anyone wants it let me know and I'll figure something else out.

Edit 3.5: Some clarification. I put the picture up on imgur earlier and had multiple people (on imgur) saying they were going to be reporting it. Hence, imgur having no chill.  I'm trying to upload elsewhere but I'm on a work computer so I'm limited.  Also, there's GOLD in my hills! I feel like the luckiest boy in the whole world!

Hopefully reddit has more chill. If not, it'll be gone quick so hurry!"
"TIFU by getting my feet stuck in a bucket of cement.


The mob were not involved. Technically this happened a few years ago but thought it was good enough to share.
I was working on a short film and needed a plaster mold of my feet, so of course I thought ""well why not"" and shoved my feet right into a bucket full of wet cement. Other than the heat of the chemical reaction between the water and the dry cement, everything seemed fine. So about 20 minutes later I tried taking my feet out, and long story short the fire brigade were called. They tokyo drifted down my drive and burst through my door. As each fireman came through the door they broke down into tears of laughter, before long they were all standing round me taking photos.

TL;DR - Needed plaster mold of feet, feet stuck, fire brigade called, they all started taking photos of me."

"TIFU By giving a stranger 20 dollars for gas money


I'm 17 working at a grocery store from 5-10. I got off at 10 and started walking across the empty parking to my truck. As soon as I got in some guy pulls out of nowhere and pulls in behind my truck. 

He gets out and I roll down my window to see what he wants. Said he needed gas money and was running on nothing. He offered me 2 cds and 2 5hour energies for just a couple bucks to fill his car up. Since there was a gas station right in the same parking lot I figured I'd give him a little. It turned out that all the cash I had was a 20 dollar bill. 

He had a somewhat new car and was decently dressed so me being the gullible teenager that I am handed him the 20 and denied the cds and 5hour energy. He shook my hand and peeled out driving past not one but two gastations I sat there dumbfounded realizing the mistake I made.


Edit: Thanks for the uplifting words guys! I realize that I lost 20 bucks , but I also realized that it could have been much worse than me losing money. Thanks for the tips on how to avoid these things I will be more cautious moving foward.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments and up votes! Its good to know I'm not the only one to fall for this. Wish yall all a good day!"
"TIFU because I made my boss think I was suicidal


I was at work. I was bored and tired and waiting for a client to call (dropping off a package) and I was typing random stuff into Google to see what the auto-suggestions were. I typed ""I'm tired"" and looked at the drop down list, selecting the first item just as the phone rang. I ran downstairs to get the package and then came back upstairs and went home without turning off my computer. I got a strange email an hour later from my boss:
&gt;Hey. Pardon me for asking, but you left a screen with a Google search up on the computer at the front desk, and I was worried.
&gt;Three things.
&gt;First, thank God you’re part of this team. Couldn’t do it without you. Everyone’s glad you’re here.
&gt;Second, if you ever want to talk about anything, including bad times and ugly shit, I’m here.
&gt;Third, I can’t promise you that life will be wonderful, but I can promise you that you can feel better about it. I didn’t believe it, but it’s true.

I emailed him telling him I was fine and asking what I had typed.

&gt;I'm tired of living

My boss is hyper-aware of depression and suicide and was scared for me. Now, all the senior attorneys are treating me with kid gloves.

Edit:  Thank you.  I was aware I have an awesome boss before this, but this made me appreciate him in a new way.  I think things are smoothed over now but we'll see.  "
"TIFU by picking my nose and ending up in the emergency room.


For the record, this is incredibly embarrassing and nobody outside of my immediate family knows about it. With that said, I have decided to post it on one of the most trafficked websites in the world. Before I begin with my story, I should add: this happened a few years ago [like most posts] when I was 18/19. I am 23 now.

It was a night like any other night: I was studying for a midterm the next day, with my nose in my books like the Hunchback of Notre Dam. Coinciding with allergy season [because studying is not miserable enough on its own], I feel my nose blocked internally with mucus and snot, sort of like when mountain towns are effectively overrun by snow.

What was I to do ? I tried using my finger as a sort of shovel, but the humidity made the contents of my nose dry and hard, like those crusty rocks inside caves. My finger was not doing any good so I decided to use the end of my mechanical pencil [https://www.amazon.com/BIC-Atlantis-Mechanical-Refillable-Pencils/dp/B000V7PBYM] to pry it out. Whilst doing so, the cap covering the eraser became dislodged, firmly implanting itself in my nasal cavity. 

My reaction, you ask ? I panic. I try to pick it out but I end up pushing it up further. Probably not the best solution in retrospect. I wake up my parents and my father grabbed a pair of pliers and tried to pull it out. Nothing doing.

So, where does that leave me ? Am I forever destined to have a pencil cap lodged in my nose ? Modern medicine suggests no. This is my cheeky way of saying I wound up going to the emergency room. I explained my dilemma to the nurse, who asked where my little brother was, because what adult would legitimately have this happen to them, right ? After five hours of waiting, the doctor walked into the room, with widened eyes [he probably skimmed the file and assumed it was a child, not a man] but asked no questions. 

A quick push of a tube of compressed air into the clear nasal canal and the pen cap shot out. My nasal canal has not had an object lodged in it since.

I will pretend that caps on pencils and pens are required to have holes precisely for this purpose and therefore I am within the norm. Nobody tell me differently.

TLDR: I was studying, picked my nose with the end of my mechanical pencil, dislodging the eraser cap and clogging my nasal canal. I ended up going to the emergency room and having a tube of compressed air put up my nose to shoot the pencil cap out. It worked.

EDIT: Front page of Reddit ! This almost makes up for this whole ordeal. Almost."
"TIFU by sleepily thinking that the angel in my tattoo was shedding feathers.


This just happened about an hour ago, and now I'm wide awake...

Backstory: got a tattoo of an angel falling from heaven a few days ago. It's pretty big and covers about half my back, which means that applying ointment/lotion to it is super tricky without assistance.

Woke up and had to pee, and while I was in the bathroom decided to apply some ointment to my tattoo since it was feeling a bit dry. I perched on the sink vanity and attempted to reach around my back to get at a tricky spot. As I smoothed my fingers over one wing, I felt something stick to my hand. I put it up close to my face and squinted (I'm half blind and was still half asleep), and there it was: a single white feather, which then floated off my finger to the floor. 

I was instantly and illogically convinced that some sort of fucked up Black Swan moment was happening (again: half asleep) and leapt off of the counter to try to look at it in the mirror. I immediately lost my balance and went crashing ass-first into the bathtub. I also took the shower curtain and quite a few bottles of shampoo/body wash with me, which made a nice, lovely crashing noise that echoed through the whole house. Boyfriend jumped up from a dead sleep and came running into the bathroom clutching the Glock from the nightstand, and our Husky started howling bloody murder outside the door because she probably thought I was dead.

Once I stopped seeing stars and tried to explain the situation to my relieved but slightly grumpy boyfriend, it occurred to me: we have a down feather pillow, and one of them must have escaped and gotten stuck to my ointment covered back.

Good morning to us...

TL;DR: a feather got stuck to my new tattoo and I thought it was coming out of my back a la Black Swan, and accidentally woke up my whole house while freaking out about it.

Edit: wow! I definitely did not expect my silly story to reach front page territory. Thanks, guys! Just to clarify, yes I am American, no I do not live in a trailer park, my boyfriend keeps the clip separate from the Glock in the nightstand so when he checked the bathroom the gun was not loaded (clip was in his hand), and lastly, the whole reason we have a gun in our nightstand is because we actually did have a home intruder about eight months ago. When confronted the intruder's reaction was to try and hurt my dog, therefore we decided to move one of our guns to a safe but easily accessible location to protect ourselves and her. 

Edit 2: a lot of people have been asking me to post pictures, so here you go:

https://imgur.com/gallery/WxQew

I've only gone through one of several sessions--we're going to add a lot more color and add more detail to the body/wings (including fixing his ""strong hand""). I was going for the idea that it could be an angel and it could be Icarus.

Also, my boyfriend has informed me that I am an idiot and used the wrong language referring to the Glock--I meant the magazine, not clip. And this is why the gun lives on his side of the bed..."
"TIFU by almost killing a guy with my nuts.


I'm a baker at a company with a strict labeling policy. I accidentally made a cookie with nuts instead of a cookie without. Since the label said it didn't contain nuts, a man decided to eat one. Instantly had a reaction. Luckily he realized right away. "
"TIFU by bringing snacks in to the theater.


So this actually happened about 4 hours ago. My friends and I went to see Snowden (which was fairly good), but being the cheap bastards we were, we went to the save-on to buy snacks, which was ironic because I ended up spending $16, mostly on pistachios, which is relevant to the story. The first 10 minutes are EXTREMELY quiet, so I was trying to open my bag of pistachios as inconspicuously as possible, but it was proving difficult. I mustered up a tiny bit more gusto and the bag exploded and SHOWERED the floor and the seats in front of me (which, thankfully, no one was sitting in), completely breaking the silence. I can still remember the exact sound of hundreds of shells bouncing off seats and the hard floor. My girlfriend was super embarrassed, and my friends were dying trying to contain their laughter. What happened didn't even register for a few seconds and I just stood there, wide-eyed, trying to comprehend the situation. I picked as many as I could off the floor in the darkness, but I know there was still at least a hundred in the aisle in front of me. If somehow the theater worker is reading this, I am so goddamn sorry I was that guy.

"TIFU by spilling two liters of piss in my bag.


So I have a problem with my liver, they don't know what it is yet so I'm doing a lot of tests.
One of them was a 24 hour urine collection, which means I had to pee is a jar for 24 hours and then give it back to the lab for analysis.
I drink a lot, so after 24 hours I had a good gallon of piss I took everywhere.

When it was finally time to take the jar back I put it in my bag because I didn't want to walk around holding a clear jar full of piss, I thought it was a good idea. It wasn't.

I was walking to the lab, and suddenly i feel water running down my legs. ""What could this be?"" I wondered for a few seconds, then it hit me. My legs and lower back were covered in my own piss.
Apparently the jar tilted, spilling half its contents in my bag.

I ran to the lab, and gave what was left to the guy there and ran back out.

Today cost me a bag, two books and a phone charger. It was not a good day.

**Edit** a lot of you are asking if I had a lid on it. I did. In fact it wasn't even my jar, the lab gave me like a plastic pitcher thing that came with a lid, I thought it would be at least to some degree water tight. It was not. Ohh also I had to go straight to work, didn't have time to shower and I serve food.

**Edit 2** just to clarify, it spilled on the way to the lab, I was not walking around with it. And about the job, I know it's gross, but I work solo shifts in a place that's really understaffed so I could not cancel or be late on such short notice, I was supposed to open the place. Btw I quit working there, it was my last shift."
"TIFU by having a disastrous medical check up


(Reposted, reformatted, renamed with fuckups highlighted to make mod-friendly!)

This wasn't today, sometime ago in fact.

I got a letter in the post telling me to go for a medical checkup for my life insurance. ""No worries"" said I, munching down on my breakfast bacon butty ""I am a picture of bloody health"". The old ball-and-chain muttered something under her breath which I didn't quite catch - it was either ""fat bastard"" or ""fit barsteward"" but she wouldn't repeat it. I'll go with the barsteward one because I have been known to frequent drinking establishments from time to time but also, memorably, did a press up as a Christmas party trick once. Just the one, mind you, don't want to end up looking like that robot fella, wozisname, Arnold... you know the bloke that whoopsed the hired help and then became a big shot politician. Yeah, that's the fella.

So anyway, I hopped in the ute the next Saturday and headed into town to see the quack. The receptionist told me the doctor was running a bit late - some old fella had swallowed his dentures or something - so I ended up sitting around in the waiting room for about an hour and a half flicking through old copies of Reader's Digest, Horse &amp; Country and Farmers Weekly.

Now, at some point, my guts got sick and tired of waiting around and started fidgeting - rapidly breaking down the mince and cheese pie I'd had for breakfast on the way into town. Mate, traffic was getting seriously backed up at the motorway exit, if you know what I mean. So, I'm sitting there thinking to myself ""Cripes, I’ll have to hold myself down for this one"" and working out a plausible excuse to go and walk around in the car park for a few minutes when the receptionist called me to see the doctor. There was no escape so I did the old reverse swallowing trick is well-known to fellas like me who are prone to the odd bumburp here and there.

Now at this point, I'd just like to describe my doctor. Most doctors are bloody old, smell of Old Spice and piss, and partial to a power nap. Usually these happen while you're describing your symptoms and you end up with a leg cast to treat your hay fever or eye drops for your chapped udders... in small towns doctors can double up as vets, by the way.

Yeah, so our new doctor is not like this at all. She is in her thirties and pretty in a sort of Dr-Quinn-Medicine-Woman kind of way. She's been bloody awesome for the district health levels because there seems to be a lot more bathing and hairbrushing and suchlike amongst the lads, and the fellas now drag the kids off to the doc at the slightest sniffle. Oh and she's bloody posh: you know that ""I drive a Volvo and get someone else to sweep the chook shit of my porch for me"" kind of posh.

So I went into the consulting room and the doctor asked if I'd like a fella to perform the exam. ""Odd"" I thought but anyway, I wouldn't want Mick the orderly there to get all involved - he'd spend an hour talking footy and I've got bloody fences to mend! So I said no.
So we did the pulse thing, and the ears, eyes, throat thing, blow in this tube, stand on the scale, blah-de-blah-de-blah. Then she asked if I would undress to my underwear and lie on the bench as she needed to check for hernias and a testicular cancer.

O-kay.

Things began to get very tricky as she was doing her checks extremely thoroughly - I was frantically trying to sing the national anthem backwards to myself whilst mentally yelling at my downstairs ""DON'T YOU BLOODY MOVE!"". Let’s just say I ignored myself. Embarrassed as, I tried to bluster through an explanation she just gave me an ""I've seen it all before don't you worry"" smile, patted my on my shoulder and then said that she needed to do a prostate exam. I would need to lower my briefs and lie on my side. ""Odd"" I thought again but only briefly as I was trying to tuck my errant old fella away out of sight.

Now at this point, I would like to make a serious complaint about the education system of the seventies and eighties. No-one explained enough about the prostate when you're at school. Most blokes don't know what it is, let alone where it is or how it’s checked. All we know is its in the section of the school textbook where there are pictures of naked people that other students over the years have decorated with little spectacles and moustaches, arrows, people's names and suchlike.

So I was lying there still smarting from embarrassment when suddenly it felt like the doctor rammed a log of firewood up my nethers. ""A bit taken aback"" is probably the politest way of describing my reaction but she persisted, rummaging around like Santa searching his grotto for a present and I swear at one point she might have been in up to her bloody elbow. If this wasn't enough, the mince and cheese pie and my over-active metabolism came back to haunt me. I farted long and hard and, my holy fuck, it smelled like it came from the deepest depth of Satan's own backside. I can quite comfortably say that the embarrassment of becoming sexually aroused during a hernia and testicular exam pales into insignificance when you fart in a doctors face.
So, needless to say, I haven't been back to the Doctor for a year and a half. My missus says the doctor often asks after me and I suspect there's been a bit of a breach of doctor/patient confidence because she always sniggers when she tells me this. Oh, and I saw the receptionist in the supermarket a month after the exam and she was laughing uncontrollably and pretending she had read something amusing on the back of a cereal packet. Personally, I’ve never seen anything on a cornflakes box that is THAT funny so she must know too.

This is why I hate insurance salesman - if it wasn't for them I'd still be mates with my doctor.

TL;DR TIFU by farting during a prostate exam

Edit: So to answer a bunch of things...

• 'Cheers' to those who said they enjoyed reading this pile of dung. 'Fair enough' to those who called it a festering heap of shite. 'Couldn't have put it better myself' to those who said I talked for ages, said very little, was unentertaining, and had the writing ability of a high school eejit. If you thought it was rubbish, down vote the hell out of it, democracy is a beautiful thing. 

• I'm an old fella and old farts like us ramble. On purpose. Mostly because it is annoying but also because it's habit after decades of pre-Internet tale-swapping in pubs. It is what it is... down vote the hell out of it.

• Is it true? Yes. Is it embellished, over the top, and flowered up? Oh fuck yes! Is farting on a doctor really a fuck up? Maybe not for her. Either way, doe vote the hell out of this turd if you think it is shit.

• Happened in a little town in Essex when I was over there for ten years or so. Us colonials tend to travel a bit before settling down to shagging sheep and getting tattooed (or whatever anyone thinks is normal of Kiwis)!

• I encourage you again to down vote this spew-laden shit-post. I just enjoyed writing it down. 

Edit 2: Thank you things...

A big cheers to coolaccount2 (whose user name understates how awesome he actually is - good on yer mate) who encouraged me to kill myself for crimes against writing and being a shit stain upon the world. Look, I love your passion and agree that the world could do with fewer shit stains upon it but I couldn't top myself before killing every pair of undies that I own for being guilty too. 

Oh and fella who coined the phrase 'overwrought maturbatory prose', I love that! Cheers for a great chuckle. Or snigger, which someone told me is an unacceptable word. 

And anyone who had a laugh at a really stupid story, I'd have a beer with you any time. 

Edit 3: Today I learned that putting the TL;DR at the top and adding the words 'long as shitpost' to it would be wise if I ever try this again :-) 

Also thanks again to coolaccount2 who's continued advice on preventing further abuse of the written word by me shrugging off this mortal wozisname has been insightful and entertaining. I did Google your suggestion and yeah, nah. Thank for your help mate.
