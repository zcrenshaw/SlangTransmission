"TIFU by taking a bath with my girlfriend


Obligatory this happened two months ago

My girlfriend and I were sick and congested.  We were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

She then asked me if I wanted to join.  Sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  She went downstairs to grab our towels and I started the bath.  As I put the oils in, I yelled asking how much I should put in.  I got the answer of only a little bit. 

Apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  I don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

As we climbed in the hot bath, I realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

In my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, I said ""Hey babe, hot water rises right?""

Right away she looked back at me and screamed ""How much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

I said I turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

So we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  It burned like icy hot.  My balls were on fire.  My girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  I'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

I then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  NOPE.  Makes it much worse.

Fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   It wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  Takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

The heat from the blankets warmed me, but I felt like I had ice under my skin.  

Half an hour later, it went away.

And that's why I'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

Tl;dr: girlfriend and I are sick.  Decide to take bath. I put enough peppermint oil in bath.  My girlfriend and I get it seeping into our pores. Has the effect of icy hot.  Balls and asshole are in pain.  Girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

Edit:  Holy shit, this is in the top ten all time TIFU's.  I'm honored and ashamed.  

Things that I've learned since I posted this last night

1. A lot about essential oils

2. My girlfriend loves how everyone is reacting to this.

3. Too many people have had similar experiences.  

Edit #2: THANK YOU WHOEVER GAME ME GOLD!  I LOVE YOU.  

Edit #3:  My girlfriend is sick and I've had a long day.  All of these comments have us laughing and in a good mood, thank you.  We both needed this.

"TIFU by grunting while getting a blowjob


So I'll start by saying that this happened years ago while I was still a teenager in high school.

I was dating a lovely lass, we'll call her Amanda, for just over two months. Her family went on a yearly trip to a roller coaster theme park.  It was roughly three hours away.  They invited me along and offered to pay for everything.  Honestly it was a great time.

 We left for our trip at around 2:30-3:00a.m. So we slept sitting in the back seat for most of the ride.  The park was a blast. Short lines, decent weather.  There from open to close. Afterwards we stayed the night in a Holiday Inn and left in the morning to return home. 

We were riding in Amanda's dad's company car. It was a white 2005 Cadillac sedan.  It was roomy but still not so much as to lay down unimpeded while sharing the back seat. Amanda's parents were in the front. Her dad was driving and she decided she was ready to nap. She put her head in my lap facing me and curled up in the rest of the bench style seat. 

She rested awhile but I guess she got bored and decided to play a road trip game to pass the time.  I wasn't aware we were going to play.  Amanda started sneakily caressing my manhood with the hand under her ""snoozing"" head. I responded physiologically rather soon, as teenage boys will do, and quickly outgrew my pants.  

Now, of course, I was nervous. I could see her parents and was occasionally engaging in small talk. Through the rearview mirror they could check back and see my face but not much lower. Amanda was wearing a hoodie with hood up and was laying mostly still.  All of this only added to the excitement though.  The risk was a reward to my adolescent mind and I sincerely doubted any repercussions.  

Anyways, my pants had seemingly shrunk and Amanda, having noticed my discomfort, took it upon herself to free me of their constraint.  Now feeling the fresh air was a relief but risk increased exponentially and so did the thrill.  Amanda must've felt exactly the same way.  So with thrill increased the obvious solution was to hide my exposed member in her mouth. I was not against this one bit. However I did have to bite my lip to stifle any verbal agreement to her action. 

We may have been young, and maybe because I was young, but Amanda was a goddess from the lips in. Every move she made was the exact right move.  There's something alpha and strange about seeing the back of someone's head while exploring the back of their daughter's head.  

So there I am.  Trying to look natural in case they use the rearview mirror.  Biting my lip, eyes wide open, mostly holding my breath.  Looking natural.  There she is. Looking asleep.  Head slowly bobbing.  Wet, soft, occasional, gagging noises.  Normal sleep stuff. I'm starting to get close.  Like three minutes in.  Severe lasting power for my teenage self. 

We had developed little signals for this situation.  The orgasm situation.  Not the blown near parents situation.  Worked for both thankfully.  Little double tap on her shoulder to alert her of incoming baby babies. Lucky for me she was of the habit of consuming these salty potentials. Which also was advantageous to this situation.  

Here's the fuck up.  I'm starting to climax.  Trying to summon lady gaga's best poker face. Holding my breath and turning red. I imagine my eyes rolled up into my skull for a brief moment because everything went black. I uttered a single soft grunt. The pivotal fuck up was less than a syllable. I re-focused on the mirror to find her father quizzically looking at me.  In less than two seconds, I'm not even through my throes, I fucked this entirely enjoyable situation up. With less than a syllable. 

I saw realization come across his eyes. Followed by anger. I hear a mutter of, ""wtf?"" I try to pull her head up just a bit. She slams back down in an attempt to contain catastrophe. However some little bit of catastrophe escaped.  A dime sized drop of milk gooey catastrophe landed just behind her hood. In plain sight of dad. 

Risk or danger tend to make sexual events that much more exciting.  It makes them feel explosively more intense.  Getting caught does not feel that way.  It's like coming to the brink of orgasm and then getting shot in the nutsack with a bb gun after the first gush. 

That little dime sized bit of full confirmation meant that I had to find my own way home.  No yelling. No berating. Just, ""Get out."" And I did just that. 

TL;DR

I got head in the back of a car that was being driven by the girl's parents and was caught just as I finished.  

Edit: Thanks kind stranger for the gilding."
"TIFU by having a cracked iPhone screen


So this literally happened 24 hours ago... hang with me on this one. I posted yesterday, but because of crappy formatting it was removed after 10 minutes. 

So.. resubmitted:

I go to a religious school, and it has a rather large church that we attend on Sundays, so a lot of time I browse Reddit. Past week I finally decided to make an account so I can upvote and comment and that sort of shit. 

Anyways... here's the story- I'm cruising old Reddit posts on /r/AskReddit under the top rated section, and reading the comments. 

I find the funniest comment to me for some reason which was ""Nothing puts me in the mood to fuck a pregnant stripper like Squidbillies."" So like a normal guy, I copy paste it to send to my friend down the row who is also on Reddit. 

But instead of iMessage, I have to hold it and send it as a text bc his data is off, whatever. But because of the cracks in my screen I accidentally pressed ""Speak"" which is next to ""Send as text message"" 

Then proceeds Siri's voice- echoing over the dead quiet sanctuary, down the balcony and off the walls: ""NOTHING PUTS ME IN THE MOOD TO FUCK A PREGNANT STRIPPER LIKE SQUIDBILLIES""

And 300 people all around me turn to see my face- red from embarrassment and eyes with tears because of how funny it actually was. 

So.. this morning after my first final exam I get a call slip to the Administration office and assigned 75 demerits and having my enrollment threatened if I let my phone scream about inter corse with pregnant strippers again. 

Fml 

EDIT: ayy thanks for the gold kind stranger! 

EDIT EDIT: it's a college and the church has maybe 6000 people in it

"TIFU by getting every field trip at my High School canceled for two years


In classic reddit fashion, T(en years ago) I fucked up by doing what I thought was a pretty innocent practical joke. I'm only just getting over the shame, so I guess I'm ready to make a throwaway and tell the story.

My entire junior class (~175 kids) was taken out to the ""big city"" to see some type of Shakespeare play. Not a broadway, but some truly awful back-woods theater production. So everybody is pissed that we didn't go see something cool. Perhaps because of that, and unbeknownst to me, a group of ~20 kids had smuggled booze into their backpacks and were getting drunk (The 16-year-old, ""God, I'm so drunk right now!"", but not actually drunk). So that's under wraps and none of the teachers find out.

Then the FU. I'm sitting at the food court of a mall on our way back home with my two best friends. One of them had bought this disgusting chocolate pudding that he didn't want. So I dared him to put some on the toilet seat of the restroom. He dared my other friend. My other friend double-dog-dared me. Knowing that you can't back down from a double-dog-dare, I knew I had to do it.

So I go in to the bathroom of the food court, put a little bit on the toilet seat, and a little bit on the wall. It's pretty minor, and I think ""Heh, did it, that's funny, and somebody could wipe this off with a napkin after they laugh about it. Maybe two napkins.""

Nope. As I'm sitting down at my seat, some employee runs screaming out of there, thinking it was real poop. Not bothering to check or reason it out. Just screaming. 

Then shit hits the fan. Teachers start randomly pulling kids aside and interrogating them. One was a former marine and he thought this was the single defining moment of his life. He goes ape-shit on everybody. I'm surprised he didn't start water-boarding people there.

It comes to light somehow that these kids have been drinking. So they are instantly blamed by the teachers but the students know it wasn't any of them (they were the cool kids). With 175 kids, the rumors are flying around real fast. We get herded into the buses immediately, and as soon as we got back, everyone was ushered into the auditorium for what were the worst hours of my life. Everybody was sitting there, and one or two kids would get called out at a time. When they came back in, another would get called out. This went on for about 3-4 hours; the complete trepidation was tangibly thick in the air. Fortunately, neither of my friends ratted me out. But all the kids who were drinking wound up with pretty severe punishments. 

All trips for the next two years canceled? Check.

Annual trip to the amusement park canceled? Check.

Senior trip canceled? Check.

People complained about poop-man for the next two years. Every time I heard that I would die of guilt on the inside. I was terrified of anybody finding out and me winding up suspended and not able to go to college. Hopefully I've passed the time horizon where anybody from my school will read this and laugh instead of going on a witch hunt...

TLDR Put some chocolate pudding on a public toilet during a field trip as a joke. Employees didn't get the joke and the school administration canceled every field trip from then on.

"TIFU when teacher tries to embarrass me in class


I made the mistake of taking a 9am class this semester. I go to a community college and live about 40 minutes away so if you do the math I have to wake up at least by 8:20am to be on time (what was I thinking?). My class has a good amount of kids, more than the average size but not too large. My teacher has a very monotone voice and speaks slowly so when he was going over a test I did relatively well on I chose not to pay attention (I got a 98 but with the curve it was a hundred). I resorted to r/tifu for entertainment. I was reading the story about the person who glued their butt cheeks together, and of course I had a huge grin on my face and was trying desperately not to laugh as I was reading more of the details. My professor suddenly hits me with the classic ""why don't you share with the class what you find so funny?"" Since the class was huge I became very embarrassed and tried to defuse the situation with ""nothing."" It didn't work and the teacher kept pressuring me to make me uncomfortable. I had no choice so I decided to briefly describe what I read ""I was laughing at a story on Reddit of this guy glueing his butt cheeks together."" My teacher was shocked and the class started dying. I was then asked to leave class and I'm sure my professor hates me now. I later found out that he started a new unit today so I missed all the notes as well.

Here's the butt glueing post I mentioned

"TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma


TIFU by almost kidnaping the wrong grandma 



My mother’s side of the family lives in Japan. Since I lived abroad ever since I was a child, I haven’t met my grandmother in a long, long time (I am closer to my paternal grandmother). Anyways, my grandma has always been afraid of flying, so she hasn’t traveled abroad in 10+ years, but this year, she decided to come visit us because her time is running out. She was supposed to come to the airport, and my mom was supposed to pick her up. 




However, some other important issues came up, and my mom had to travel to a different city for two days. So instead, I went to pick up my grandma from the airport. (Note that we can’t communicate with one another directly because she doesn’t speak English and I suck at Japanese.) I waited at the airport for 2 hours prior to her arrival time because I was nervous af. All I had was a recent photograph of her and her phone number in case I can’t find her. People arrived, and I kept waiting for an old Asian lady with snow white hair to come out. I tried calling her phone number, but it seemed like she ran out of battery or intentionally turned it off. After all, she’s not tech savvy and she barely manages to dial our phone number because she’s very old—80’s approaching 90. 



From the terminal, I saw an Asian lady come out; she had white hair and looked exactly like the lady in the photograph I’m holding. I assumed it’s my grandma, so I approached her, and said welcome in my super broken Japanese. She responded very kindly and said something I can’t understand; I told her in English that we’ll talk more when mom’s around to translate. I offered to take her luggage, and we walked out together. 




We got home, and I fixed my grandma some food, and showed her to my empty brother’s room [sic: brother's empty room]. I assumed she must be tired so I left her to be. Roughly 3~4 hours later, my mom called me and asked why I haven’t gone to pick up grandma. I asked her, “wtf are you talking about because she’s here with me,” and I snapped a photo and sent it to mom. Then she told me that the lady isn’t our nana. 



Apparently, my grandma had arrived at the airport, but didn’t fill out the paperwork, so it took her extra 30 minutes to get out. She waited for me at the airport. She also didn’t pack her charger in her luggage and her phone had run out of battery, so she asked other Japanese passengers to help her call her daughter (aka my mom) after she waited at the airport all alone FOR 3 HOURS. After talking to grandma, my mom called me in panic. 




Anyways, I went back to the airport to pick up my real grandma, and she gave me a hug. I came back and talked to my fake grandma by having my mom translate our conversation via phone call. She was just an old lady from Japan whose family signed her up for a spa getaway retreat after her husband passed away, and thought I was from the agency to pick her up. I asked which resort she booked, saw her itinerary papers, and drove her to the place she signed up for. Before she left, my real grandma, fake grandma, and I had a mini supper, and I apologized for causing major confusion. 




Before I dropped off my fake grandma at the resort, she tipped me. 







_________________________________________________________________________




EDIT: 





[Fake grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/VlM4kgB.jpg) looks like this. Please don't say that I subjected her to a hostile environment for making her sit on the floor. She kept on sitting on the floor. She was so nice to me, never lost her cute smile, and tried to talk to me in Japanese, but I couldn't understand her. This is the one and only photo I have of her (which I sent to my mom); she was okay with me taking a photo of her, but if someone on reddit is her family member and want this photo taken down, send me a message and I'll do so upon verification that you're her relative. 

[Real grandma] (http://i.imgur.com/AFrn6Za.jpg) looks like this. This photo was taken by my mom at night. She probably loled at my failure. 


By the way, [this] (http://i.imgur.com/eRXfMXq.jpg) was the photo I had to *guide* me at the airport. This photo was literally the only photo my mom had of grandma from the last 5 years because she hated taking photos. Please note that it doesn't really show her face, so I was mostly looking for ""white hair + old + short Asian grandma"" at the airport. 



For those who need proof of the bill I received: 



[Asian money envelope] (http://i.imgur.com/UcYldgV.jpg) She had given me the money in that white envelope; the envelope is from a Korean foreign currency exchange bank, which makes me assume that she visited Korea prior to her travel here. She also left some coins at my house--don't know if fake grandma left them or my real grandma. I'll have to ask.  



[She gave me money] (http://i.imgur.com/6aI1ORs.jpg)

[She left these coins behind] (http://i.imgur.com/XhNhxyH.jpg)

"TIFU accepting a free couch


About 6 years back I lived in a dive apartment (my first place; a little one bedroom, one bathroom with a single kitchen/multi room) It was fairly cheap and all I could afford. I took in free furniture where I could and didn't turn down a good freebie. 

After a few months a neighbor offered me a couch. (Hell yeah! It was a sectional couch so big that it took over most my living space!) I never stopped to think why someone would give away a perfectly good couch. Turns out it was a huge mistake....

A few weeks go by with the couch and being the single guy I was and not owning a real bed, but a futon (a real bed was too expensive) I chose to start sleeping on the giant couch. It was so comfortable and swallowed me in all the right places, but shortly after I started sleeping there I noticed an odd rash on my forearm. 

My first thought was that the rash was something in the community laundry room I bumped against or something at work (I was a temp agent at that time doing whatever job floated my way) I was prone to being a janitor for a week here, a box sorter there. I did all sorts of things and came in contact with allot of different products, I paid no mind to the rash.

I had visited a neighbor a few weeks later and mentioned the rash only on that arm over dinner. Thinking they may have an answer or something to make it go away. My neighbors who didn't speak the greatest English laughed laugh and said it was  just a chinche's and to wash it away. Wtf is a Chinche? I asked them having never heard of it and thinking it was a plant or something... They told me to go where I slept and look there and wash them away. And that it wasn't any problem. So I did....

I didn't know what I was looking for. I flipped the cushions over patted around, vacuumed out crumbs etc. Found nothing out of the ordinary and went about my life. A couple days later I run into my neighbor again who immediately ask about the Chinche. I said all I could find were crumbs and a few candy wrappers and that I don't know what to look for. That's when they mentioned I needed to look in the corners and dark spaces. I did just that later that day and was horrified...

What seemed like hundreds of bugs were in the giant folds of plump dark brown cushions at mid back level right where my rash arm was always at. There were clusters of them huddled together with babies and old exoskeletons littered about their sleeve of cushion. Not knowing what they were and having searched the entire couch finding batches hidden throughout went to google.

Bedbugs! I honestly only knew them from the night time saying (don't let the bedbugs bite) I didn't know they were real thing! They're living in my couch and feeding on my body like a buffet every night while I ignorantly lay there for them. They needed to go! 

I googled how to remove them and seen all sorts of  company's tarping homes and gassing entire buildings. Heater treatments that ruined homes by seemingly near melting the insides. Crazy chemicals and pesticides the works. All of which I couldn't afford. So I vacuumed the little bastards and sprayed raid up under the cushions. Sleeping on the couch with 2-3 bed sheets draped over I picked up at Walmart.

I started looking into chemical alternatives at sone point when the vacuum treatments weren't enough and found that cedar oil is a natural remedy at a fraction of the cost. I jumped at it and after some reviews settled on Cedar Oil. I went through a couple bottles fast and ended up buying a gallon. This was the best choice I could of found at the time since nobody at that time seemed to sell ""bedbug spray"". It worked!

Although I ended up trashing my couch, blankets, what few pillows I had and my futon mattress. I was lucky enough to not have much and lost very little when I moved out and in with my girlfriend. She wasn't sure why all my wood furniture smelled like cedar oil and I had to tell her of my battle with the bugs. 6 years later I keep the rest of that same gallon in the garage just in case my son and wife notice anything. I will be ready when or if it happens again. 

TL;DR:
Defeated bedbugs with Cedar Oil and learned not to accept a free couch from foreign neighbors."
"TIFU by eating a peanut butter sandwich


This happened a little over a week ago and I'm certainly not proud of this one. 

I was working my usual shift at a candy shop in my home town. Working that day was this very elderly woman and myself. Boss decided not to come in (it was a Monday so slow business around this time anyway). 

Around noontime I took my lunch as usual, eating a peanut butter sandwich and a couple of pieces of candy. Everything went smoothly for about 20 minutes after I finished. Then suddenly I had this horrible pain shooting across my chest and through my neck. 

This is when my anxiety does it's thing and I start to panic on the inside. This just makes things worse and the pain intensifies to the point I think I may be having a heart attack. I walk up to the woman I'm with and she stares at me and says ""you look terrible! Is everything okay?"" I reached my breaking point and told her I had to go to the hospital. She understood and let me leave. 

I drove down town to a hospital that is local to me. The entire time imagining the worst cases in my mind. I get hooked up to all the machines as all my symptoms are synonymous with a heart attack. My family joins me in the medical room all worried sick of course. 

It was then that the doctor comes in with a half-smirk telling me that I strained my esophagus from eating too quickly. This was causing immense pain down my chest and neck. 

After looking like a complete idiot, the nurse comes in and asks my family to leave for a second. She tells me they have to give me a shot for the pain which made me feel a little better about the whole thing. That was until I saw the needle. This massive thing she pulled out brought back the little kid inside me. This was not exactly what I had imagined, I figured a little needle or even just give me an ibuprofen and I'll be on my way. But nope. 

She tells me to bend over because it's going my ass. I laughed thinking she was kidding. She wasn't. The shot hurt worse than the pain in my chest. It was like taking a nail gun to the butt. I couldn't sit for hours after. I'm still getting made fun of for this. 

TL;DR: Ate a sandwich and got a shot in the ass because of it. 


Edit: Thanks for all the responses and stories! 
Edit 2: Thanks for the gold!

"TIFU by shitting on my boyfriend's dick. NSFW


**Edit: So I just learned about the Jared-subway-thing. I'm not american, so I had no idea. To me it's just a name. Carry on!**

Yes, this is an anal story. Let's do this.

It happened with my boyfriend of now 4 years; we'll call him Jared. He was my first at pretty much everything, but he was sexually active long before he met me. One day, around 3 years ago, we were watching a movie where a group of people discussed anal, and I realized that in the time Jared and I had been together, we'd never tried it, and hardly talked about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I asked him if he had tried it with another girl before, if he liked it and what he'd think about trying it with me. He had not tried it with another girl, and to be honest, he said, it had been a consideration of his to try it with me for a quite a while. He just didn't feel the need to bring it up at that point, because we were experimenting with other things as well. 

A few days pass, and I spend some time reading about anal online. At this point, I'm determined to give us this experience: I buy a completely new kind of lube, I practice washing myself way further up than usual, and I wear the buttplugs we already had for far longer, without anybody knowing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, Friday arrives and I decide, this is it. I'm excited and nervous, but I eventually tell Jared about my plans, and invite him to the bedroom. Boy doesn't object: I got this. 

&amp;nbsp;

It's difficult. Much more complicated than a buttplug: a penis is actually attached to something and completely out of my control. Also, he was clearly excited about the situation, so he was a bit larger than he used to be. However pleasant that sight is, it was pretty inconvenient. 

He moves too fucking much, trying to make it pleasant for me. Sweet, but I can't feel anything but pain, and I eventually have to ask him to get completely still so I can figure this out. Furthermore, we probably didn't use enough lube. 

We try a few different positions, but they all hurt after a few seconds. I finally decide to get on top of him, with my backside to his face. Alright, perhaps this works. I get going and he seems to be enjoying it; I'm just trying to get used to the feeling, but at least it doesn't hurt that much... Until after about 30 seconds, and I decide I can't take it anymore, and I jump off to sit on his stomach for a break. 

&amp;nbsp;

*And I freeze at the sight of what was before me.* 

&amp;nbsp; 

**His entire dick was covered in a thick coat of feces.** With clear signs of our dinner last night. 

I don't know what to do. What do I tell him? I'm blocking his view, so he doesn't know what's going on. I soon realize I have to tell him. There's no other way around. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Why did this happen? What did I do wrong? Everything was fine, why the fuck did this happen, holy shit! 

&amp;nbsp;

I close my eyes and say, as calmly as I can, with a shaking, crackling voice; 

""Jared. Do **exactly** as I say. Get out of bed very slowly and carefully, walk to the bathroom, **do not touch or go near anything,** and clean yourself thoroughly in the shower. And whatever you do, **do not look down.** Are we clear?""

And he starts laughing. My heart is beating so fast I can feel it pounding in my chest. My face is warm, my hands are shaking and my ass **fucking. Hurts**. And he belly-laughs at me, knowing exactly what happened. I'm so embarrased I'm almost crying, but his warm laughter eases me and I end up chuckling along as well, while tearing up. I'm completely beside myself. This was not part of the plan. Screw this.

&amp;nbsp;

He does as I say: he doesn't look down, he walks slowly to the bathroom, and takes a nice, long shower. He won't shut up about it, though. He asks me why I'm embarrassed and tells me everything's cool. He invites me to join him in the shower, he hugs and kisses me and laughs at the whole thing. I'm still in panic-mode. I just want to go to bed and watch some movies: maybe order take-out. Forget everything. 

A few days later we try anal again, and this time, without any ""interference"". I guess mission is completed, right?...

&amp;nbsp;

But he won't ever let me forget it, of course.

To this very day, every once in a while, when I'm cooking, or working, or watching something, he sneaks up behind me, pulls my hair gently aside, and whispers softly in my ear: *""Do you remember that time you took a shit on my penis?""*


&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: I tried anal with my boyfriend and ended up unintentionally covering his penis in my feces. To this day he still mocks me about it. It's the small things in life.**

"TIFU by not wanting to eat the sour part of the jawbreaker. Images inside


So this just happened last night. So you know those giant fist sized jaw breakers? Well I had one and I really didn't have the patience to lick the thing all night so I was going to break it and eat it in chunks (My first mistake). So I threw it on the ground and it jumped up and bruised the knuckle on my right hand. So next time I threw it against the wall and taught it who's boss. *(I have tiled flooring and brick walls, also for all of those who told me to use a hammer please remember I am in a girls dorm room. There is a certain lack of hammers. Also the jawbreaker was in multiple Ziploc bags as to not get candy everywhere and to keep it clean!)*

When I finally busted the ball into several pieces small enough to fit in my mouth I had another brilliant idea. Lets scrape out the middle of the jawbreaker, the sour part that I don't like, with my pocket knife. So I am sitting on the floor of my dorm room with my extremely sharp pocket knife and started scraping off the nasty core of the jawbreaker shards. Then I slipped and next thing I know I was looking at bone, I had sliced threw my pointer finger on my left hand. I knew what I had to do and used my other hand to apply pressure on the wound, I calmly spoke to my roommate telling her I need to go to the hospital when I did fuck up #3. 

I was starting to feel slightly off so I started pacing across the room to keep my mind off it and woke up a minute later on the floor with my roommate screaming at me. I had passed out and hit my head on the tile floor. So the roommate called the front desk and the RLC came rushing into our room (I forgot to mention I am on campus, I'm a college student), and saw me on the floor blood everywhere and freaked out. I was the only calm one in the room. 

Eventually we wrapped up my finger and I found a ride to the hospital. They wouldn't let me drive myself, and I agreed. At the hospital they took off my makeshift bandage and it started bleeding everywhere almost causing me to pass out again. Finally I got it stitched up and was sent home. The doctors found it funny how I managed to hurt myself and I was really embarrassed.

**TL;DR I didn't want to eat the sour part of my jawbreaker so I tried to cut it out with knife and sliced my finger to the bone in the process and passed out. Made it to the hospital and to the doctors amusement got 4 stitches, 2 inside and 2 outside. I still have not eaten the rest of the jawbreaker.**

"TIFU by getting super excited at the beach


Went to the beach with my housemates instead of going by myself as I'd planned. We went to a different beach which is more like a 'bay' as it's a little beach area with a long channel of water greeted by built up concrete on either side until it hits the ocean. You can set up along the man made banks with your gear and jump into the water at deeper depths. It's great. Very 'european' for an Aussie beach. 

Got there and found a spot. It's 34c here today (93f) so when my housemate said ""straight to the water?"" I replied ""fuck yeah"", as you would. I rip my singlet off, run over to the edge and dive in. It was cold but not crazy cold.. perfect in fact. I'm treading water when I feel something bob against my leg and as I reach down to figure out whatever the hell it is I'm greeted by a large rectangular object inside my pocket. My iPhone 6s Plus.

I immediately scramble over to the wall and throw it on top. I'm unable to get myself up there because it's low tide but I try anyway, scraping my arm up. I swim around to some steps and as I'm getting out of the water I realise my wallet is in my back pocket as well. I grab my now soaked phone in front of 10's of people clearly aware of my fuck up if they saw what happened. The embarassment is real.

Shaking the phone saw several drops come out. I left it in the sun hoping it'd help evap the water. I went home a few hours later and so far not so good with the rice bag. I'll leave it overnight and try again before calling it. It's a work phone too. 

TL;DR - I got excited as soon as I got to the beach and jumped into the water with my phone and wallet still in my pockets.

Edit: For those who care cause it seems some people do.. it's Clovelly beach in Sydney. TinyURL to Google images [here](http://tinyurl.com/h56anmk). 

Edit 2: 24 hours later the phone isn't turning on. It's my work phone and has AppleCare. I'm the IT manager so I'll try my luck with Apple or buy a new phonel. Maybe it's time to go back to Android.. *cough* Pixel *cough* no waterproofing though *cough*

Edit 3: Turns out I'm not the only one that fucked up that day. Shortly after we left we saw police rescue vans with their sirens on going in the opposite direction, towards the beach. Turns out a lady fell off the 10m cliff and broke her leg. Shite. I think she wins."
"TIFU by gorilla gluing my buttcheeks together


Title says it all. I was curious and wanted to see what would happen. I really need to take a dump and am not sure what is going to happen now. I think I am going to take a shower to try and fix this. Any tips to get me out of this mess I have now found myself in? 

EDIT: So late last night I was able to separate the cheeks. They are not sealed together anymore, now there is just a ring of gnarled up hair mixed with dry glue chunks. I think a few more bath treatments and it should all come out within the next couple of days. Going to the ER at this point would be pointless, a lot more painful, and probably quite expensive.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the comments and upvotes everyone. I am doing well and all of your responses have made this ordeal much more bearable. On a funnier sidenote, I am so proud to have my TIFU thread cause someone else to experience a TIFU-worthy experience, which was then posted as another TIFU. Someone else on Reddit was reading my post while in class, couldnt control their laughter, and the teacher forced them to read my story to the class, causing another embarrassing moment worthy of this subreddit. You guys are great."
"TIFU by thinking I was skilled at archery


Rewind it back to this time last year: I was back home for a few days before my exams, and I was really stressed out by all my schoolwork and various other things. I needed to relieve some stress. Bad. So, what better way to do that than by grabbing the ol' archery kit and shooting some arrows?! I was always a pretty decent shot before, so I just assumed that my skills were innate and were always with me. I used to shoot on a target, but we just left it outside and eventually the elements did their thing, and it pretty much rotted. So, I found an old basketball in the bushes and decided to shoot at that. Not wanting the neighbors to get suspicious, I decided to shoot on a narrow path beside the house where no one could see. I kicked the ball about 20 ft in front of me in a nice, tight space between the house and the bamboo. Easy shot. I loaded up the bow and aimed at the ball and let go. Next thing I know there is smoke everywhere and I don't know why. Well, I soon realized I had missed the ball terribly and instead had a perfectly accurate shot at the AC unit's copper piping, puncturing the pipe and letting freon escape everywhere. I had no idea what to do, no one was home, so I ran inside and turned off all the electricity in the house, and that ended up stopping the smoke. After an earful from my parents everything ended up being ok, and luckily the damage was just enough so that the whole thing didn't have to be replaced.

"TIFU by trying to teepee my friend's ex GF's house


So this happened back when I was a senior in high school. It was homecoming week, which is code for getting drunk and doing stupid things. We were not drunk when we decided to do this, might have been better if we were. My group of friends in high school were well liked, but we kind of bordered on nerddom. We never did too much out of the norm, and very rarely ever got into trouble. This meant we didn't have curfews or anything like that. 

Back on topic, it is Homecoming, and my friend, let's call him Jeff, decided we should teepee his recent ex-GF's house. Now our high school was a combination of farm towns, suburbs, and a small portion of a large city. His ex lived in the city part. About 6 of us piled into an old Buick and drove down to the dead end street she lived on. Thinking we were smart.... we blacked out our headlights as we drove on her street. We first drove by her house to make sure everyone was gone, they were. We then doubled back and parked up the street instead of right in front of her house. We decided at that point, we were too far away and drove up a little more and parked once again. As we were getting ready to exit the car, 3 cars come up the street and block us. One of them is a jacked up truck with lights on top of the cab shining at us. A group of 15 people emerge, some with baseball bats, others with chains, and still some others with huge Maglite flashlights. They were all tapping them into their palms like you see in movies before the gang fight begins. We were all scared to death, and trying to figure out what to do (this was before cell phones were popular). We finally agreed we would all exit on the count of 3 to figure out what was happening. So on 3 I got out and began walking toward the huge group of rednecks with weapons. Turns out none of the others in the car did. They all chickened out and let me confront the angry mob. I get up there and the first thing they said is, ""we have called the police they are on their way!"" I thought to myself, thank god, at least if I am murdered the cops will be here shortly. They then said, ""So it is true, crooks like to return to the scene of a crime, right?"" At this point I was completely confused. I looked back at the car of my friends, and they were all scared but also laughing that I was the one stuck talking to this group. I explained to the mob that we were stupid teenagers looking to teepee a house. One of the leaders of the mob kind of chuckled and explained that earlier that night, several houses and sheds on that street had been broken into and power tools and several guns were taken. 

Just as I was hearing that story, 4 different police cruisers came speeding in. Three of them blocked in the car my friends were in and the other one approached me and the mob. The first two get out with their guns aimed at me. The mob leader then said, it was a false alarm, we were not the robbers. The officers holster their weapons and call off the other units. After a bit of time there is just two officers left. One approached me and the other the mob. I explained to the lady that we were just going to teepee a house, that was it. She looked at my friends in the car, then the trunk of our car and told us to wait. She talks with her partner and then they both approach us. She said that it was all a big misunderstanding due to the earlier criminal activity. She said we should leave the area, so everyone can simmer down and relax. She said, ""Go grab a bite to eat at Perkins or something, then if you still want to come back and teepee the house. Just don't get caught."" She looks at her partner and asks, ""Can I say that?"" The other cop shrugs and they go back to their car. I get back in the car and my nerves were still shot having to defuse all of this by myself. My friends are laughing hysterically at me for having to do this. They decided to come back later and still teepee the house, I chose to stay back. 

TL;DR - Went to teepee a house, get confronted by an angry mob with weapons, cops are called with guns drawn, and it turns out is all a big misunderstanding due to earlier robberies.
