"TIFU by unintentionally taking the train home during my lunch break


My intention was to go to the train station to renew my season ticket but my body was on auto-pilot and went straight past the barriers, checked for the next available train and got on it. Realised that I was not meant to actually leave on a train when I looked around and the train wasn't as jam-packed as it usually is. Tried to make it out of the train but unfortunately did not make it. Am waiting at the next station now to return to work....and hopefully to renew my season ticket on my way there...

Update:  Thanks for all the comments.  Nice to see fellow mindless numpties out there. 

Just to update you all - I made it back to work in time, but as I got back to my station the queue to the ticket counter was painfully long... so long that I got worried I would switch to auto-pilot mode again and hop on the train once I get my ticket!  Luckily I didn't and made it back in time but without lunch, I pretty much functioned on auto-pilot mode for the rest of the day!"
"TIFU by smoking a joint.


So I'm literally writing this about 30 minutes after it happened,

So this morning I'm thinking I'm going to smoke a small joint before I go into work to deal some minor stress (dad just had a heart attack this morning) so I'm running late thanks to the awful choice to smoke a joint, as I realise I wasn't going to get to the train station in time I spent £10 on a taxi there,

So I get to the train station and buy my ticket (£6.80) and jump on the train ready to not be late for work!

So what happens? Because I'm so fucking baked I leave my ticket and the receipt on the train... get to the barriers and I can't find the bloody thing, at which point I ask an attendant if I'm able to re buy my ticket and he tells me ""yes but you're going to have to pay a £20 fine for traveling without a ticket as well"" as annoying as this is I can't do much but agree, so I pay, now my journey is at £33.60 so far, I then ask if I can have my ticket so I can return back from work later and I'm told ""no you will have to buy another one"" 

So after this costly shitstorm of a travel fare I get into work and explain my shitty morning to my manager and that I'm going to need to take tomorrow off to see my dad in hospital,

I then find out that I have booked today and tomorrow off about 2 weeks ago.

TIFU..

TL;DR

Got high, late for work, paid an expensive taxi, lost train ticket on train, got fined, had to buy a new one as well, didn't even have to be at work today, the journey totalled £40.40."
"TIFU by forgetting to poop.


So I work for a cable provider taking calls for tech support. During my day, I get two 15 minute breaks and a half hour break. This all started about 30 minutes ago, and is still a very active situation.

About 15 minutes before my break, I felt the feeling in the pit if my stomach that I needed to relieve my self. Looking at the time, I realized I was close enough to my break to not worry about it. 5 minutes later I began to worry, as the feeling turned from a tingle to slight pain. Looking back at the time, I was unsure if I would make it. Fast forward to the final 5 minutes before my break and I started to feel like I would barely make it. Standing seemed to help a lot for some reason, so I paced in front of my desk while finishing my last call. That actually made me feel much better and almost relieved the pain entirely. Once the call was over, I clocked out for my break and headed for the restroom.
This is where the fuckup really begins.

I walk into the restroom, pulled my pants down and my phone out, and sat down on the toilet. I began browsing reddit, minding the clock as to not be late from my break. Reading through some TIFU posts and laughing at some of you idiots always helps me pass the time. After a few minutes I realized I should head back. I pulled up my pants and walked back to my desk. I only made it about 45 seconds into my first call after the break before that all too familiar pain returned. Thats when it hit me. I forgot to poop. I am currently pacing in front of my desk,  sweat forming at the top of my head, clenching my cheeks as I am typing this on my phone, waiting for my customers equipment to reset. The countdown begins.

TL:DR: had to poop really bad while at work, went to restroom and forgot to poop, now I may shit my pants.

Edit:Update: After what was almost an hour long call, I put my phone in ""personal"" time and ran to the bathroom, barely made it to the seat, and had a glorious bowel evacuation. Thank you all for reading and laughing at my situation. :)

Edit: the letter A

Edit: GOLD? Who knew forgetting to poop would create reddit gold! Thanks stranger! "
"TIFU by getting my co worker fired


This happened last week.
I work at a Mazda dealership, which is quite slow during the week. I went out to the store to get lunch and when I came back my friend/ co worker wasn't there, so I figured he was out back behind the store smoking the blunt he told me about earlier. Well, I didn't know he was actually test driving with customers.  One of the features these new Mazdas do is read your text messages out loud, so he had paired his phone to show the customer how it worked. 
He didn't expect me to text him ""Yo you smokin the blunt out back?""....
Well the customers immediately told my manager, who decided not to fire both of us, just my friend. He decided to punish me internally. I feel really bad, this guy trained me and I feel like a shittard"

"TIFU by trying to translate the entire Bee Movie script to Swedish and breaking my phone


Earlier today I was texting my friend and decided to send him the Bee Movie script as a joke. I then got the bright idea of trying to translate it to a random language using my phone. Regretfully, I didn't consider the fact that sending or receiving the script as an iMessage usually crashes my messages app; it should have crossed my mind that Safari probably wouldn't do much better. 

Safari froze in the middle of translating and wouldn't open correctly, so I restarted my phone. I have since restarted it two more times and Safari is still unresponsive when I open it, and as long as the app is running my phone works very slowly.

TL;DR: I tried to translate an entire script to another language on my phone and now safari won't work.

Edit: To those of you giving me ways to fix the problem: Thank you! This post blew up overnight for me and I only just saw it, but I managed it o fix it with the clear cache thing. I'm not the most tech savvy person so wouldn't have known what to do without your comments.

Edit 2: First time making it to the front page! It feels great to know that my highest rated post is a meme-related fuck up! Thanks to all who commented/upvoted :)"
"TIFU by putting my shit in my ear


[UPDATE](https://redd.it/5cu36m)

Yesterday I was listening to music at home when I was hit with the uncontrollable urge to take a massive dump. So I charged to the bathroom down the hall, did what I needed to do, and flushed. 

When I got up to wash my hands, my earbuds fell out of my ears and hit the bottom of the toilet bowl with a terrifying thump. 

I panicked, because I have a history of destroying my earbuds in magnificent ways. Without thinking, I pulled the earbuds out of the water using the chord that was still attached to my phone and stuck one of them in my right ear to test if they still worked. They did, and I was relieved, until I wasn't. 

Realizing my fuck up as soon and the earbud squished into place, I yanked it out and started washing my ear out in shame. I had just put something that was in a toilet bowl that was just full of my crap just seconds ago into my poor ear. 

I decided to call it a night, and I woke up this morning with a splitting headache, fever, and my ear was burning. So I realized that it must be infected. 

TL;DR I'm never going to hear the end of this shit. 

Update: Holy shit front page! I woke up this morning feeling a lot better, the fever is gone but I still have a bad headache. Doctor's appointment is scheduled for later today. 

Edit: Read through the comments, and just wanted to say that the fever that I had yesterday was very small. I've also had was I think is a cold for the past week, and the fever was most likely caused by that. I just took my temperature after the shitty incident, and that's what I attributed it to first. 
Leaving for the doctor in a couple of hours."
"TIFU by stealing my grandmother's chocolate


This happened not today, but many a year ago;

When I was young, my family lived very close to my maternal grandparents. Their house was just two blocks away and a couple times a week, my mother would walk over with my brother and me around lunchtime. We would all have lunch together, then my mom and grandmom would sit in the kitchen playing cards and talking while I played with my brother in the living room.

One day my brother and I were busy building a Lego city after lunch, and the grown-ups decided to put their card game on hold to watch their favorite soap opera on the living room TV. My mother shooed us out, telling us to go play in the kitchen for a while and have a snack. There was a bowl of potato chips and some soda on the table so we sat down, ate our snack, and played Go Fish with the deck of cards.

After a while, the soap was about to end and my brother and I are getting bored, so we decided to head back out to the living room. Bro ran out and, as I was leaving the kitchen, I saw a little forgotten-looking bar of chocolate on the counter. It was a segmented chocolate bar, partially wrapped in its foil wrapper, and there were only a couple of sections missing. SCORE! Being the sneaky little shit I was, I quickly pocketed it and headed back out to the Lego mess. My brother and I created blocky multi-colored worlds for a while, then I excused myself to the bathroom to eat my ill-gotten candy in secrecy, because I was greedy as well as sneaky. It tasted a little dry and stale but chocolate is chocolate and I was an eight-year-old kid, so it's all good. I squished up the empty foil wrapper, flushed it, and went back out to play.

Shortly after, my wonderful and loving grandmother came out and sweetly asked us if we took some candy that she left on the counter. Of course, we both denied it and looked up at her with our big innocent child eyes. She then got serious. She placed her fists on her hips, looked sternly down on us, and said, *""I know it was on the counter this morning. Somebody took it, and I think it was one of you kids. If either of you took it, I want you to be honest and tell me now. I will be angry, but you should not lie to your grandmother.""*

We both gave her innocent blank stares.

Grandmom pointed her finger at us, *""One of you is lying. I don't know who, and I'm done asking, but know this; God will punish whichever one of you stole that chocolate and then lied about it. When that happens, I will know it was you. So, this is your last chance to tell the truth.""*

More innocent stares and claims of innocence. She turned and went back to her card game in the kitchen without another word. I wasn't overly worried. My grandmother had a flair for theatrics and, as far as I was concerned, I had committed the perfect crime. Let them suspect me, they had no evidence so HAHA! (I'd like to again point out that I was a horrible little shit.) I assured my little brother that I didn't take it, and we went back to our Lego pile.

About 20-30 minutes later I began to feel a little... off. Nothing especially worrying, just some gurgling and rumbling in my gut like I was gassy, only without the actual gas. I tried to ignore it. Shortly after, I felt like I needed to poop. Still nothing to freak out over. It steadily and swiftly got worse. Very swiftly. After a few more minutes there was a massive *clenching* in my lower gut, I broke out in a cold sweat, and I had to get out of there *immediately*. So I dropped everything and sprinted to the upstairs bathroom. I barely had time to drop my pants and sit before my ass full-on detonated.  The cramping was horrible! Each stomach cramp was immediately followed by a high-pressure gritty liquid explosion. My ass had become Hell's fire hose and there was no sign of when it would stop.

After what seemed like forever, my digestive tract was finally empty and I sat there dazed and exhausted. I was shaking and too weak to even get up from the toilet. There was a knock on the door, then my grandmother peeked in and asked if I was okay. I told her I had a stomach ache and was sick. Her chilling response; *""This is the punishment I told you about. You should have told me the truth when you had the chance. You were able to lie to me, but God knows the truth. I want an apology, but I'm not going to punish you. I think you've suffered enough.""*

Years later, this story came up in conversation. I asked my grandmother, who was not at all religious, how she was so sure that God would punish me. Her answer; *""It was a bar of Ex Lax.""*

**TL;DR - Stole a candy bar from my grandmother, repeatedly lied about it, grandmom called down the wrath of God on my literal ass.**

"TIFU by letting my drunk friend sleep on my floor


So we were both seriously wasted, and he lives far away so I said he could spend the night with me. Nothing particularly unusual, I've let him sleep on the couch at my place before, but this time there was no free furniture so he slept on the floor. 

Before he KOed for the night he guzzled down some water to stop the hangover. Then we both went to sleep.

At about 6am I hear a rustling, and I see him walking around the room. I try to ignore it and turn over. The next thing I know he's taking off his pants, and then he starts pissing all over my bed with me in it.

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING DUDE??!""

He looks at me like I've inconvenienced him somehow. He shrugs and says ""I wasn't aiming for you"". Then he walks over to the other side of the room and opens my closet and starts pissing in it.  

And well. My room is covered in his piss."
"TIFU by squatting on the toilet


This happened a few months back. I usually poop at work cause I don't get much time in the morning at home and am usually in a hurry. This day, I wasn't particularly feeling well. So I sit down on a toilet at office and find that I actually can't force the shit out. So I decide to put my legs up and squat on the seat, as I know that helps with bowel movement. Now, this toilet is not on the floor but actually attached to the back wall. As it turns out, the putty and plaster holding it to the wall is pretty bad and as I, rather uncomfortably try to force out a doodie, squatting on the rather narrow toilet seat, the stupid thing breaks loose from the wall. So I'm sitting there on the floor with ceramic pieces all around me, a few minor cuts in my ass and hands covered in toilet water, while more water splashing my back from the opening on the wall. Thankfully no shit was present in the toilet. A couple of people started banging on the door asking if I'm all right. I told them the toilet broke. One of the kind blokes called a janitor who handed me a rug with which I cleaned myself the best I could, put on my pants and walked out with an ashamed look on my face. My manager and co-workers got a good laugh and I was allowed to take the rest of the day off and get myself sorted. No one who isn't reading this knows that I was squatting on the toilet.


Edit: Reading through the comments, I realise I got off extremely lucky. From here onwards, I shall always check the integrity of a toilet before taking a shit in it.    
Also, I took my shoes off before squatting, because I had to take off my pants, I don't see how anyone could sqaut and poop with their pants on!!"

"TIFU by trying to prove that my phone screen wouldn't crack


Having had smartphones for the past 4 years, I've never had a screen crack. No matter how many drops, the screen has always been fine.

So over a meal today when someone wouldn't stop going on about how often their screen smashes, I tried to shut them up by hitting my phone against the table.

Well what do you know, it smashed. It smashed really fucking bad. I even held it up and went *""see, they don't crack""* before realising. I then had to sit through another two hours of this douche boasting about all the times he's proved people wrong."
"TIFU by locking eyes with my neighbour as I peed


Our bathroom is on the second story with a small window high up above the toilet facing our neighbours place.

I am pretty tall so when I stand there to pee my eyeline is directly out the window looking into their kitchen on the first floor.

The other day I was standing there taking a piss when I accidentally locked eyes with the wife of the neighbours household. Goddam that was awkward.
Then today a similar thing happened when I was standing there doing my business and we locked eyes again. We both looked around awkwardly but I wasn't done yet so I just had to keep standing there. In a couple of seconds she checked to see if I was still there and we locked eyes again! At this point she gestures to her husband who looks up and now we lock eyes! 

I was there thinking ""what is wrong with these people? Why would they stare at me while I am trying to pee? Weirdos."" 

It was only just then that I realised that these people have no idea that I am peeing, they have no clue what room of the house I am in. To them I am just some freak who stands at the window a few times a day and stares at them. Even worse I am some freak who gets caught perving into their home and I just look around awkwardly for a few seconds then just keeps on looking at them!
So.... yeah... fuck. Now I have to crouch down while I pee.

TL;DR: I keep locking eyes with my neighbours through the window as I pee and it is extremely awkward. "
"TIFU By not paying attention at Subway on National Sandwhich Day


This happened yesterday so in good TIFU tradition, not actually today!  

Girlfriend and I went to Subway to get our sandwich on in honor of National Sandwich Day courtesy of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. While discussing whether we should get 12"" or 6"" subs the Subway Man overheard and misinterpreted our discussion as our order and since they were rather busy began making our sandwiches... All 72"" of them. Before we could say anything he had 4 of them already covered in our desired meat/meatballs and was asking us what cheese we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene we looked at each other and both nodded in agreement and said ""Fuck It, we've gotten this far...""  

I'm happy to say we are now the proud owners of Six 12"" Subway Subs and will be eating Subway non-stop for at least a couple days. Thankfully it is only cost the price of 3 Subs so it didn't break the bank.  

TL;DR Celebrated National Sandwhich Day in the correct fashion, ordered 6 Subs instead of 2 because I'm to socially awkward to correct a mistake.

EDIT: Words, now that I'm on PC instead of phone.  

EDIT 2: Replaced the restaurants name with &lt;Redacted&gt; (Bravo's Sub Par Sandwiches) &lt;Redacted&gt; to prevent r/hailcorporate from having a HayDay.  
  
Edit 3: Due to popular request changed it back Subway"
"TIFU by dropping a lighter in a fryer


I'm going leave out a lot of details to avoid self incriminating here because this could have been a lot worse and was seriously dangerous . This actually did happen just a few hours ago too . 

So I was a little inebriated and stumbling a little more than I would like to have been . I pull something out of my pocket and as Im you can guess my lighter came out with it and after some mid-air fumbling around it plug right into the fryer.

I was in a panic at first trying to figure out what exactly I should do while at the same time trying to fish with the lighter out of the fryer before the inevitable happens... An explosion.

After a brief moment of fishing around with no success I was starting to panic quite a bit about the explosion that was soon to come. I decide that I had been fooling around for long enough and needed to take cover. Right as I am turning around to take side cover is the same moment the lighter finally explodes. I was expecting some sort of huge catastrophe but lucky enough all it did was clean fryer grease everywhere which sounds horrible but given the circumstances I was pretty worried the worst would happen. Luckily all that happened was I took a solid spray of find fryer grease to the face. The spray was thin enough that I didn't burn myself too badly but it shocked me enough for me to fall backwards over the pizza oven and onto my ass. Fryer grease also managed to land all over the floor since a big flop shot out of the fryer but none of that hit me luckily. I walked away with a sore ass from falling over and like a dumbass and some mild burning that felt like sunburn on my face. All and all it would have been hilarious for someone to have witnessed it but thank God I was alone in the kitchen at the time because it was definitely a dumb spectacle to see.

Tl:dr 
I dropped a bic lighter in a fryer and wouldn't ya guess it exploded . No injuries except my ego. "
