"TIFU Accidental LSD Breakfast


Ok, so obligatory long time ago in a dimension far, far away...I was 22 years old and living in a sharehouse with my SO and another girl. The housemate was away for the weekend at a dance party, so I was enjoying a rare morning to myself.
I woke up early and went to make some breakfast. In the fridge, I noticed the shiny golden wrapper of a delicious Ferraro Rocher hazelnut chocolate treat. Being a somewhat greedy and kind of sneaky 22 year old, I did some quick justification math and figured it was ok if I ate it, as long as I replaced it before my flat mate came home. 
I scoffed the chocolate and went about making coffee. 
Not long after I started feeling a bit light headed...my boyfriend had woken up by this stage and I told him I was feeling weird. I've got epilepsy and at that stage in my life, I used to have a lot of seizures. He asked me if I'd done anything unusual that morning. I said nope, everything was routine....oh except I ate that chocolate the flat mate was stashing. 
He looked me dead in the eye and said, uh what??  I'm like, yeah, you know, the Ferraro Rocher. He looks kind of semi-serious and says in a very calm voice ""ok so don't panic, but there's acid in that chocolate""
I do some quick counting. I reckon I've got maybe 15 mins before it kicks in properly. 
""Uhhhh, do you know how many doses?""
My boyfriend pats my hand, says ""just 1. Maybe 2. Tops"" 
I figure it's too late to panic. I quickly got some fresh pjs, had a quick shower and turned on the Teletubbies. Before the creepy baby sun giggled and said hello, I was tripping balls and it was barely 7.30am. I guess it serves me right for being a sneaky chocolate stealer. 

TL/DR - unknowingly stole LSD-laced chocolate. Got instant psychedelic karma. 

EDIT: some common questions (and sorry about late reply, I dropped this before bed and woke up to boom)
1. How didn't I know and BF did? Cause I'm a flaky chick who was apparently told but I don't recall that. 
2. Yes I replaced the acid
3. It wasn't that strong TBH - really only Teletubbies and Daft Punk worthy. We're not talking bleeding prisms of laser light here people.
4. I'm sure it's the plot of lots of movies. Weird shit happens in sharehouses. 
5. Lying for karma? Lol. I don't care about fake internet points. It's a funny story I thought I'd share with you all. I told my mum this story (she's a nurse) she tells EVERYONE, she thinks it's hilarious. 

Edit 2: holy shit did this make it to r/all? "
"TIFU by not stopping a rumor of me being a school shooter.


Like most TIFU the major fuck up happened about 2 years ago, but the build up started 6 months before that.

 Let me start by giving you some back story. I went to private school from 4th grade until this happened my Junior year of high school. Before I was homeschooled. Perfect innocent sheltered child… right? Wrong… Major social reject on all levels. Did not make any actual friends until my freshman year of high school and because of being in private school I went to the same high school as the people I went to middle school with. So all the ass hats from middle school followed me and my social position had no hope of changing. Because of this I made friends with the other “rejects”. You know… the stoners, emos, rebels, budding anarchists, and so on. I adopted every one of these stereo types. Since there were only 300 people in my school, everyone knew me and my five friends. We wore hoodies every day over our uniforms to rebel against our strict dress code, even when it was 100 degrees outside. We were those kids that parents tell their kids to stay away from. And it only made it worse that my older brother was the star quarterback and was the most popular senior in school.


Now onto the real story.


After my brother graduated I (sophomore) was expected to fill his role on the football team (I can’t play worth shit). Luckily one of my people was already on the team so I decided to join (small enough school where there weren’t tryouts). Surprisingly I actually showed up to practice and gave my hardest, but I sucked so much that it probably looked like I half assed everything. Played about 4 minutes of game time that season… on JV… whatever it was something to do. During summer off season my junior year one of the senior stars told my friend that he looked like one of the Columbine shooters… Being those kids we thought it was funny shit. So we let the rumor/joke continue. 


We never thought it would stick around because new rumors were started about us every day. But this rumor was very different. It stuck around… and grew… by the end of the season the rumor had grown extremely complex and overly detailed… but so far it had stayed in the locker room. (I didn’t care). 


I came to school the Monday before Thanksgiving break to find that my friend was not there… interesting… it was rare that we could get away with skipping school. Oh well. By the second period I had an uneasy feeling. About halfway through 2nd the dean of discipline (also head football coach) called me out of class and started walking with me to his office, he didn’t say a word. Odd but ok. 


He took me past his office and into the principle’s office (even though I was a little shit I had never been here). In here both of my parents (who should have been at work) were sitting with extremely worried expressions. The dean left and so it was just me in the room with my parents. As soon as the door shut my mom asked me what the hell was going on. I ran through my mind all the possible things that I could have been busted for that both of my parents were summoned. I said I didn’t know but kept thinking about what it could be... (pot? That kid that tried to stab me the week before?) 


After about 5 minutes of awkward and terrifying silence two detectives entered the room and asked if they could record the interview. My mind was racing and I started getting really scared. They said that one of my classmates was arrested that morning because of a school shooting tip off… (oh shit… this is not good) they told me that the informant said I was going to supply him with the guns to do it. I denied and told the officers that my family didn’t have guns and that I was only 17 so I couldn’t have bought any… My parents backed me up. The detectives asked the same question over and over again… and apparently one time I worded my answer in a way they took as me admitting guilt. 


The school expelled me and my parents contacted a lawyer and were advised to take me out of state in case a warrant was placed for my arrest. (lawyer would be alerted first and we could discuss possibilities before cops came and arrested me). We took our thanksgiving break early and visited family. 


At the end of everything my friend was 16 so they did not need a warrant to arrest him. He spent two weeks in juvenile detention center and another 6 months under house arrest before the case was wiped off his record. He had to redo his junior year and is still pretty shaken up by it. I was 17 so they needed a warrant for my arrest but they didn’t have enough evidence to get a judge to sign one. I got expelled from school and had to transfer to the public school. My parents were not mad at me at all but furious with the school. Both my friend and I are still close friends and we were both drastically changed for the better.


TL;DR. Rumor about my friend shooting up our high school and me supplying him with weapons. Cops got involved, and he was arrested and served 6 months house arrest. 


EDIT: This guy sent me a message with a link to an animated video of this story I thought it was great so I am adding it to this! [Video Story!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCteT-RqXz8)

"TIFU by getting electrocuted by KFC Wet Wipes


So this actually happened today.

I was hungry around lunch and thought that I'd get some KFC after seeing all the new deals on TV. Anyway, I bought it, ate it, nothing interesting there. But a little later on I noticed a bunch of those wet wipes that come with the meal just sitting on my desk. I didn't even need to use one, but I got bored and decided to open one... with my electric plasma lighter. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, it's a lighter which uses two arcs of electricity instead of a flame.

Yeah, stupid decision already but what I hadn't realized/remembered is that the inner side of the wet wipes were lined with a metal which I assume is aluminum. It doesn't look like it from the outside though, rather like paper. In hindsight it makes sense to prevent moisture from getting out, but this is Today I Fucked Up not Today I Made a Conscientious Decision, so I stupidly decided to try and hold one side of the packet, while zapping the other end with my plasma lighter.

The moment I did that I got a huge jolt (much worse than I would have thought from something like a lighter) and threw both the lighter and the packet down and clenched my hand in pain. I think I'm going to go vegan now.

TL;DR: Tried to open a KFC wet wipe packet with electricity, got jolted and probably broke my lighter.

EDIT: Front page of Reddit, you guys are amazing! Also, I'm not actually going vegan, that was just a joke but thanks for the advice anyway!"

"TIFU by volunteering to be a foster home for the Humane Society. Signed up to receive 4 - 6 kittens, came home with 8 puppies.


Sorry for formatting. My intranet at work is terrible for Reddit and image hosting. I'll add with mobile later. 

Last May, two friends and I signed up to foster a litter of kittens from the local shelter. We chose kittens because they're low maintenance in respect to puppies. We have a good place to do it, love animals, and have the time. So we walked into the shelter, signed up, received a background check, and then told to standby. On June 1st we got the call. We were so excited. The clerk informed us that they did not have kittens, but puppies. We discussed amongst ourselves and agreed we could do 4 puppies instead of kittens. When we arrived, they brought us straight into a room with 8 puppies hobbling around and squeaking. They were 2-3 weeks old. 3-5 pounds each. Their mother had died. A vet technician was bottle feeding one. Our hearts melted. 

We asked which we would be taking. The Vtech looked at us weird and said, ""Well, the whole litter I would hope."" 8 puppies 1 litter. Just then the manager walks in and thanks us for volunteering. He goes on to explain that the shelter currently had a terrible parvo outbreak and their quarantine ward was overflowing. If we only took 4, the rest would likely die. 

So off we went, in a Nissan Altima with a bucket of puppies. 

The next six weeks we raised the puppies until they were old enough to be spayed/neutered. (The vet said that was at 8 weeks, I recognize some find that a little premature). We started with formula and bottles, then soft food (dry food mixed with water) and then dry food. 

Our main issues were containment and clean up. 8 puppies can eat and excrete more than you can imagine.

To contain them, we started with a caged off area inside the house. Mistake. After 3 days, we didn't sleep much as they all woke up every 4-6 hours. It was clear the floor would be ruined due to excrement. I then constructed a cage using 2 plastic kiddie pools stacked on top of each other. This worked until the pups learned to pile bodies on one side permitting 2-3 puppers to climb the pile of fluff and escape. This small cage also quickly filled with waste, despite changing the puddle pads hourly. It was small, so they would then roll in their filth. The plan briefed well, and looked cool, but didn't work out. Phase 3 was the back porch. We hung chicken wire around the posts and put up 3 foot baby gates by the stairs. They were trapped. The area is 6'x10'. Plenty of space. Half of it is covered. Wood floors. We power washed it every day while they got their baths. Success! Cleaning them was the largest problem. I won't go into too much detail unless asked. Just... poo. Everywhere. 

The house was wrecked and smelled for a considerable time. The deck was chewed up. The cat was so stressed she lost hair. 

I still adopted one of the bastards. 

TL;DR Wanted to try out fostering, starting with an easy job. Went from 4 to 8 real quick.

"TIFU by making an 11 yr old snort putrid milk



Out with my girlfriend and her son tonight for dinner and a few errands. Each time we get in the car, the two of them mention a rotten smell. I'm not picking it up as I've been fighting a cold. First trip: ""What's that smell? Bacon?"" She says. ""I don't know"" I say and joke that I 'may' have farted. Hop out and grab some Indian dinner.

Next trip ""Seriously, what is that?"" she asks. ""ugh, I know! Blech!!"" He moans. I say, ""What? really? I'm not getting anything. That's weird."" I'm thinking maybe I left some fast food in the back seat or something. We go into Sam's club and get a few things.

Trip three: ""OMG!"" They both say. Now I'm racking my brain. ""Maybe I spilled some milk or something..?"", I say. ""Spilled milk? In your car?!"" ""Yeah!"" I chuckle. ""Sometimes I drink milk in my car, you know?

Then I remember it. The 3 week old tetra pack of Horizon 2% milk that her kiddo stuck in the passenger seat pocket. He's a great kid. He's just always leaving stuff in my back seat.

""Hey Nathan, maybe that smell is the pack of milk you left in my car!"", I joke...sort of ( knowing if I'm right, maybe this'll make him stop leaving trash in the car) Here's where my brain stops working.... ""Give it a squeeze and check.""

As I give a quick glance over my shoulder to see if he's done it and if his milk is the culprit, he gives it a good squeeze. Now mind you, I thought the pack was empty. It was not. Not even close. In an instant, a burst of foul milk LITERALLY shoots UP his left nostril. Now I bust out laughing, but quickly reel it in knowing how fucked up that must be for him. He's gagging and fighting back tears. His mom's hunting for napkins or ANYTHING AT ALL to help this poor kid out. Now we're all busting a gut. He's waffling between crying, gagging and laughing and has milk still draining from his nose and running down his face. And for the first time, I get a whiff of it. I dry heave. Dry heave again. The drive home becomes a mix of laughing, gagging rolling windows up and down and planning his immediate trip to the shower so he can start to breathe through his nose again. Good times.

TL;DR. My car stunk. I convinced my girlfriend's kid to shoot rotten milk up his nose to find the culprit. It was the milk.

EDIT apologies for the difficult read. I had to post it twice and when I copy-pasted the formatting went to hell.  Didn't notice until I woke up this morning. 
Glad so many enjoyed it!"
"TIFU by knocking on my dorm window.


Unlike most TIFU this actually happened about 2 minutes ago..
I had just gotten home from my morning class, put on my jams and looked out my window. 6 stories below me I spotted a friend walking past my dorm. For the hell of it I thought i should try to get his attention. Since the windows don't open in my dorm the only way to achieve this would be knocking on the window. After about 5 knocks the window gave out sending shattered glass everywhere... it rained down on the people below. Needless to say I am FUCKED. and the worst part is I don't even know if I got my friend's attention.... 
About to submit a ""work order"" need excuses to make it look like an accident....

TL;DR. Knocked on window to get friend's attention which broke under the pressure.

Edit. I went to my RA like most of you suggested. Told him I knocked on the a few times to see if anyone could hear me... *judgmental look from him* and that it broke. He didn't laugh.. told me I was an idiot but he did not want this to be in anyway brought back to him. So he used his RA powers to call maintenance to quickly replace the window before it became a big issue. Maintenance is on their way..."
"TIFU by peeing on my girlfriend's makeup.


I'm going to start this off with a disclaimer. I wasn't aware this event even happened until my girlfriend told me about it the next morning. 

I don't like going to clubs downtown but my girlfriend does, so me being the good boyfriend that I am, I bring myself to the point of drunkenness where everything is a good idea! We didn't have much time to pre drink so I ""had"" to rush as much alcohol into me as fast as possible. 20 minutes, half a 26 of gin and a bottle of beer later, we were in an Uber headed downtown. 

Now I'm not a big guy. I'm 21 years old, just under 5'9"" and weigh about 165lbs, so you can imagine that I was feeling pretty heckin' inebriated. But the club had a promotion where an 8 ounce cup of beer cost a dollar. So how could I refuse 25 of them? Yes, I eventually vomited, but that's no issue in comparison to what would happen later that night.

Cut to bed time at around 2:30am, I had all my puke outta me, some McDonalds intta me, my face brushed and my teeth washed. I was doin' pretty well for myself in that moment.

4am rolled around and I rolled out of bed. My girlfriend awoke but soon closed her eyes after realizing I was just going to the bathroom. But my drunken ass couldn't find its way there. My girlfriend then jolted awake to the sound of my yellow rain pouring down upon her makeup bench located at the foot of her bed. 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" she asked.

To which I replied, ""Pee pee"", after my stream had halted midway.

She directed me to the bathroom across the hall. I lifted the seat, emptied the remaining 7/8ths of my ammo, washed my hands and plummeted back into our bed. I had no idea that any of this happened until I checked my phone the next day.

Luckily, my gold only showered over her highlighter (it's a makeup thing, I guess) which will only cost me $50 to replace in lieu of the potential hundreds of dollars of other stuff. Fortunately for me, she wasn't mad. She actually thought it was pretty funny. She's a keeper. As for me, I'll be abstaining from alcohol for a while.

TL;DR - Got really drunk. Woke up at 4am. Didn't make it to the bathroom. Peed on my girlfriends makeup bench ruining her $50 highlighter.

Edit: 
Here's a link to the text conversation I woke up to. I figured it would give you better insight on the event. I censored our names to preserve our anonymity but some of the photos' quality worsened because of it.

"TIFU by pooping too hard and splitting my head open.


This happened a couple of days ago,  I'm still recovering.

On Thursday I got a vasectomy, everything went well, I wasn't in too much pain and they let me go home after the anaesthetic wore off. On Friday morning I was a bit sore, but I still got out of bed and went through my morning routine like normal. After breakfast I sat down on the toilet, and that's where the trouble started.

As I started pooping I could feel a dull ache growing in my balls, and the more I pushed the more intense it got, and seemed to pulsate up through my guts and down my legs. I slowly began dumping my load, and the pain got worse, like my balls were being squeezed in a rotating vice. I started to feel a bit faint, but I still wasn't finished, so I took a deep breath and prepared for the final push...

The next thing I know I'm waking from some kind of dream, wondering why everything has gone quiet, with no idea where I am or what's going on. It takes me a few moments to realise I'm face down in a puddle of blood on the bathroom floor.

I looked like an absolute mess but felt ok after that, there was a gaping wound on my forehead but at least the pain in my balls had subsided. My wife drove me to the hospital to make sure I was ok, and they glued up the gash in my head and made me hang around for four hours just in case I passed out again. Strangely, neither the ER doctor nor the surgeon who had snipped me the day before believed that pooping could trigger that kind of pain in my balls. 

The next time I took a dump I spread pillows out on the bathroom floor to catch me if I went down. I still got some intense pain, but luckily managed to stay conscious.

TL;DR: Got snipped, pooped, passed out.

Edit 1: Judging by the comments, I probably overemphasised the ""pushing"" part. I wasn't straining at all, but even the smallest muscle movement down there was setting off the pain. Still should have stopped...

Edit 2: They gave me general anaesthesia for the vasectomy, from what I understand this was the anaesthetist's personal preference. Got it done in an Australian public hospital."
"TIFU I caused a massive traffic jam while I was grocery shopping.


So this happened many years ago. I went to my local grocery store, parked the car, shopped for about 15/20 minutes, then came out to find my car wasn't where I parked it. I knew it hadn't been towed. (I frequented that plaza often and towing was not an issue.) Maybe it had been stolen. As I considered the headache that would present, an 'uh oh, you fucked up' explanation hit me.

Cut to a few years prior, when very similarly, I went to a store in a plaza and when I came out my car wasn't where I parked it. I ran the reasons in my head but then I looked up. There was my car, way across the other end of the parking lot. Thoroughly confused, I rushed over and got in. It was then I realised what had happened: I had left the car in neutral (it was manual transmission) and forgotten to apply the parking brake. 

Because I had left the steering wheel turned, the car rolled backwards just the way I had pulled in, and proceeded right into another parking spot where it stopped against a fence. How it didn't hit someone, rolled out into emptiness, perfectly slid back into an empty row of parking spots and just rested there, was bizarre.

Cut back to me outside the grocery store. I panicked: had I done it again?! I took a deep breath, looked up, and saw my car. In the middle of the street. It was blocking the two eastbound lanes, and as I moved my eyes to the left I saw a sea of cars, and a bus, sitting in traffic behind it. (To this day, I have such a vivid image of the glow of all those brake and headlights against my on an angle parked in the middle of the street car.)

I didn't have time to process anything. All I knew was that every second I stood there wondering what happened and what I should do was another second all those people in their cars were going to get even more pissed off.

So I just ignored the what would have otherwise been paralyzing embarrassment, and started walking calmly but quickly towards my car, grocery bags in hand. Walked through the parking lot, down the slope to the sidewalk and into the street, up to the car. I was far too embarrassed to look at anyone, so I smiled strangely, opened the door, got in, and drove off. 

I still wonder what I seemed like to them- emerging from the store and acting what possibly appeared nonchalant about having inconvenienced all those people, with a such a strange situation. 'Oh, terribly sorry about having parked in the street again, but it's simply the best spot!' (In your best Mrs. Howell voice.)

I want to add that it's thoroughly bizarre, again, how the car ended up where it did with no harm to people, or cars, including my own. Next time I was at the plaza I had a good look and the car had rolled into the row of parking spots behind it, which managed to be empty, over the concrete parking curb, in between two signs, down a grassy slope, across the sidewalk and into the (main and busy) street where there were no cars, or they were far away enough to be able to stop in time. How all those elements lined up, I'll never know.

Don't worry- I drive an automatic now.

TL;DR I forgot to leave my car in gear and put on the parking brake, and it rolled into the street causing a massive traffic jam- all while I was grocery shopping.

EDIT: Welp, I misremembered the story. I DID apply the parking brake, but didn't leave the car in gear- so when the parking brake wasn't strong enough there was nothing to stop the car from rolling. That was the crucial mistake. A Redditor below made me suddenly realise the circumstance I described made no sense- the car would have 100% rolled immediately, with the slightest incline. It honestly happened so long ago my brain catostrophised everything to idiotic proportions.

TIFU my TIFU post. (And the title, apparently. Thanks to another Redditor for making see that one.) "

"TIFU by not knowing micro/nano SIM cards existed


so after 'using' a completely broken crappy iphone clone for many many years now I finally decided to get a proper, fully functional android phone.

said phone arrived about an hour ago and of course I jumped straight into setting it up. When it came time to pop the SIM card in I was confused that it didnt seem to fit in the slideout tray. I took a glance at the instructions and saw the tiny SIM pictured taking up half a tray but I decided to assume that meant the other half sat outside the tray. At this point I knew something was up but I decided there'd be no harm in trying. Big mistake.

The SIM card slipped in and my recovery attempts only served to push it in further, until it was jammed deep inside. faffing about with paperclips for 30 minutes didn't get me anywhere so I decided to see if anyone else on the internet had been as dumb as I was.



I came across a tip to remove it that sounded perfect! heating up a needle and sticking it inside the card? What could go wrong!?

Long story short, the SIM card seems to be in 3 pieces and melted into the slot and the phone has no removeable cover. Guess I'll have to be the guy with no phone number for another 5 years.

---------------------
tl;dr: melted a SIM card into my brand new phones sim+sd slot while all the accessories are still on their way to me. Gotta come up with excuses for why I still can't be contacted via mobile."
