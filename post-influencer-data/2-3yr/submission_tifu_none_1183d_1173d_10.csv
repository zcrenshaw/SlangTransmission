"TIFU by showing my daughter videos of the Japanese Tsunami.


My 7 year old daughter told me how cool tsunamis are and wish one would hit our town. I told her they are terrible and told her about the one in Japan in 2011 and how it had killed around 20,000 people. She didn't believe me so I showed her a video on YouTube of a Japanese town getting obliterated by one. She freaked out, started screaming. We live by the sea and she is now convinced one will hit our town. The swell is quite big at the moment and you can hear the waves crashing from our house and it's freaking her out. Like a good big sis she told my 3 year old how we're all going to die, which freaked her out. I've had nearly 6 hrs of crying and screaming. They've made a camp on the top bunk and have been there for 2 hrs. Quiet at the moment...I'm resisting the urge to shout ""tsunami!!!""....

EDIT: Thanks for all the posts, this really exploded. I understand this got pulled earlier so not sure if you'll see this....probably those terrible incest posts. You'll be pleased to know there were no tsunamis today. For those wanting to know where we are in New Zealand. These were the videos I showed her:

"TIFU by putting ant poison on a hornets nest


For once someone actually posts on the day of their fuck up because it actually happen like 5 hours ago. So I live in a secluded part of an already small town, just under a mile from Illinois's second largest forest preserve. Needless to say living in basically in an acre of forest has lots of bugs. The bugs like to get down in the cracked foundation and build nests and colonize down there and sure enough we have a Carpenter ant infestation.  I took this hose and big bottle of ant poison and just let it drain down there.  As I see all these ants running/dying/panicking like it's the smite of Soddam and Gomorrah, I see this wasp fly into a little hole on my siding.  I figure while I'm at it,  I'll poison them too.  I get up on my roof and find this hole and start going to town with the poison.  These were wasps,  not bees,  not hornets,  wasps.  These fuckers get angry.  They do not pollinate flowers,  they do not produce honey.  They literally exist to fuck shit up.  They sting more than once. They give off a chemical that alerts other wasps that they're in danger and need back up when they sting or die. This is where I fucked up. The poison is only used for ants roaches and spiders. This poison only made them angry. I pull out the hose out of this hole and a steady stream of furious wasps come pouring out like the final scene from Braveheart only with wasps and King Edward's army was my exposed skin.  (On a side note, it's 95 degrees in the end of June and I'm on a black tar roof. Of course I have no shirt on.) This is bad.  I'm swatting and getting stung like crazy. I'm on a roof so I can't get too crazy or I might fall off.  I make like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs and get out of there as fast as I could. As I was on the ladder,  one of the wasps gets me right in the eye.  I'm freaking out. Now I can't see so I jump half way off the ladder. Have you felt your internal organs shift?  Well I did today.  I land and feel my guts move up in my body but my knees and ankles and hips take the impact. I land in a rose bush.  I'm dazed and confused,  on the ground, scraped up, sore, blinded and getting stung by bees.  I finally make it into my house and am currently in a tub of ice water applying ointment to my stings.  
TL;DR: Tried to kill a wasp infestation on my roof with ant poison, WHICH FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY DOES NOT WORK!  SPECIFICALLY GET WASP KILLER, got attacked, jumped half way off a ladder into a rose bush (shirtless) and am currently nursing my wounds...  and pride.

Edit 1: spelling, grammar (as usual) and wording on what constitutes a bee.


Edit 2: Holy Shit this post blew up, I guess it really is funny when someone else gets hurt."
"TIFU by taking my entire hotel's internet down for a day


Alright, so this happened Monday. I was staying at a hotel with my brother for a few days while he was in LA for a conference...

**Context:** 

We both brought our desktops (my brother was streaming, and I wanted to browse dank memes), but neither of us had wireless adapters. I called ahead and found out the hotel only had a single network jack in each room - no problem, I figured: I'll just grab one of my extra routers I have laying around and wire us both up through that.

I grab a random router that a friend had given to me - I'd never used before, but since it was the first one I saw I just grabbed it.

-

So this is where the fuck up happens: we get everything set up, I plug in the router, and only my brother's computer is getting internet through the router.

No problem, I figure. I'll just log onto the router and fix that.

Now, anyone that's worked with many home routers before knows they generally use some variation of 192.168.0.1 as their logon address.

My main router is just that address, so that's the first one I tried plugging into the address bar (you can probably see where this is going) well, up comes the login screen, and I try to guess the username and password (remember, never used this router before, and it was a random Chinese brand, so I wasn't familiar with the setup page or the login it used):

&gt;Username: admin

&gt;Password: ~~admin~~ password

And I'm in. Great, going smoothly so far. I start changing settings... But for some reason nothing's happening. Then, in a move of desperation, I start changing any settings I can...

-

Suddenly, everything's down. My phone is no longer able to browse while on WiFi - I pull out my laptop, same thing. I call down to the front desk and ask if their internet is working... NOPE.

They also couldn't accept payments because of this, so I just fucked them over big time. Everyone else in the hotel can't use the internet to get work done.

It was down for about 6 hours. When it finally came back up, hardwired still didn't work. 

So yeah, that was about my greatest unintentional hack ever.

-

**TL;DR** - hotel didn't change the default username/pass on their ISP box, I accidentally logged on thinking it was my own router and ended up disabling the entire hotel's internet access for half a day

EDIT: To the people calling BS... You can believe it or not. I got nothing to gain by posting this... I just thought it was a funny story you'd all enjoy hearing, and could help some people change their default logins. If you don't think it's real, that's fine, but sometimes just because something is unusual, doesn't make it fake.

EDIT2: And to everyone who thinks I didn't actually take my desktop... https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4p4w1c/staying_at_a_hotel_for_a_few_days_too_much/

Also, here's the router's setup page, showing how I ended up having it set up: http://i.imgur.com/46OqRWF.jpg"
"TIFU by wetting my boyfriend's bed


Reddit, my body betrayed me. 

You know how sometimes you have those dreams where you use the toilet.... and then you wake up and *luckily* they didn't come true? Well I wasn't so lucky.

This morning, around 5am, I woke up with a strange feeling as though I had just peed. I snuck a hand down there to check, and yup, at 24 years old, I wet the bed. 

If I were in my own bed it would be no big deal. But I had stayed the night at my boyfriend's, and he was in the bed next to me. So I did what any mortified girl would do, and [panic-messaged my best friend](http://imgur.com/a/f2pKz).

After about half an hour of stressing about what to do, I finally woke him up, confessed, and burst into tears. After his initial horror, he was very understanding and we got up and changed the sheets (after a long series of terrible puns, i.e. he said he's not *pissed off* -_- )"
"TIFU By finishing my PhD.


So this happened last December, but it still is going on (please excuse my English, it is not my native language [or area]).

So I was a high school teacher and decided to pursue a PhD, got accepted in several universities, went for the one with the best funding I could get as an international student (benefits + tuition remission + about 10k a year). I meet my now husband (American), and I teach every day, get wonderful evaluations, write my dissertation, attend conferences, publish a couple of articles, write a book on the side. Happy times, tough I work between 60 to 70 hours a week. 8 years pass.

I am finally ready with my dissertation completed, defended, 4 interviews lined up in January. 

I deposit my dissertation, get my PhD, get the gown and do the whole commencement thing, my family comes, claps, and glows.

Went to the interviews, spent close to $2000 but hey, it is an investment, no?

No. Here comes reality...

I did not get a campus visit, so now I am unemployed, no healthcare, no bus pass, no student discount, no income, no access to libraries, journals, books, computers, software, technology, conferences. Each application costs me about $64 and hours of my time to get it ready. 

Most universities are only hiring adjuncts or students, basically having a PhD disqualifies you for a job.

I kind of get an adjunct position in a town nearby, they offer me $2000 for the whole semester and 2 courses, no benefits. I can't even pay the gas to go to work and if I work, I would lose the Obamacare and have to get insurance, which I will not be able to pay. I have to decline, I can't afford to have a job.

I apply back to high schools, no one will hire me because I have a PhD and they do not have the budget. I apply for a AP grader position, no, I have been too long out of the High School system to meet criteria.

I fucked up, reddit, I just wanted to teach.

**TL;DR** If you are doing a PhD, don't finish it. If you finish it, apply for another one. The only time you will be in Academia is if you are a student.

**Edit:** Well, I certainly did not expect this to get so big. I just woke up today to another ""dear applicant"" email and wanted to vent.

To answer a few questions: Yes, of course my PhD is in the humanities.

I finished in 8 years, it is below the average in the humanities (at least at my ex-university).

I also applied to public highschools, and you do not negotiate the salary, and they do not have the budget to hire expensive PhDs.

I can teach something other than Span 101, I have taught several courses that I have designed myself (not only grammar).

**Important** Do not take my advise, finish your dissertation, finish your PhD, etc.

And, I am no longer in Obamacare, that was one month and apparently I was clearly misguided, I am now in my husband's insurance. I will do more research before claiming again that statement, however, still, $2000 for 2 classes is shit.

And thank you for all the great suggestions, encouragements, and all of that. Not so many thanks to all the insults, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , what can I do?

To all the PhD's who have landed jobs, congratulations, please unionize with the adjuncts and graduate student workers and fix the system. Perhaps you can."
"TIFU by losing my sister in the Suicide Forest.


Currently in Aokigahara, at a fork in the trail, writing this.  Some back story is needed?

Every year, I visit Japan. As a whole, it is a very lovely country and I enjoy meeting new people. I plan out my trips very meticulously because I tend to freak out if my plans deviate in the slightest. It is a very stressful, but well-worth it when it pans out.

My younger sister is a morbid little sucker. She's keen on anything creepy, and sometimes that's a problem for me.  I can't tolerate the spooky.  I go into panic mode and immediately assume the worst case scenario is happening. You know that terrible movie called The Forest that just came out? She loved it and wanted to go there on this trip. Something about finding dead bodies and updoots, whatever the hell that means. I managed to plan a hiking trip for today, and the area is actually pretty cool. We went into lava caves near the base of Mt Fuji and got to see bats. There was also an underground ice cave with enormous blocks of ice. So far so good, right?

Except my dumb ass got distracted by bright red motherfucking mushrooms and I started taking pictures and lagging behind. When I stood up, she wasn't there. 

Oh crap.

After two hours of running up and down the trails, I still can't find her. She might have gone off trail. I'm back at the spot where I last saw her and decided to wait. It's getting cold, and threatening to rain. I'm the only one holding the mobile WiFi device, so I can't reach her cellphone (which is in Airplane mode, btw). I hope she pops out of it to call. 

I have to pee, but I don't want to get murdered by ghosts or falling in a hole. I give it 30 more minutes here before I go find someone at the park office to help me.

Will update.

**UPDATE**: I hear police sirens going off in the distance. I'm worried, going to go in that direction to find help.

**UPDATE 2**: I have peed in Aokigahara. It has literally scared the piss out of me.

**UPDATE 3**: My sister has been found! She ran into a police officer after finding a person hanging by the side of the road. She went to ask for directions, but they didn't respond. That's when she saw the nylon rope. She was following a line of red tape to get back on the path and hailed down the officer, but he already knew. We're going home, she's pretty shook up.

**EDIT**: Here's some of the details I posted throughout the thread:

 [Mushrooms](http://imgur.com/a/aUFQo), [Caves](http://imgur.com/a/Qb64w) and [Trees](http://imgur.com/a/WAbbN).  Taken using my cellphone camera, I know they're kind of shitty.

• I was waiting at the fork in the road for her, so I had some time to kill. I forced myself to calm down, take a seat, and wait for her to come back. Running down the trails was getting me nowhere, and she had to pass back through the fork to get back to the bat cave. So I had some time to reddit. As long as you don't stray off the path, it's really easy to navigate. I didn't want to walk 15km trying to find her, so staying in the spot I last saw her sounded like a good plan.

• The fork I was at is about 1.2km from the Saiko Bat Cave. There's a colored map board at the junction.

**To visualize**:
Pull up google maps of the Saiko lake area. There is a main road that loops all the way around the forest. There are a series of trails that intersect the area. I was at the junction where four of those trails converged. The other trails dump you out on the main road or the caves. The bat and ice caves actually have an attendant and gift shop attached. She found him near the main road, at the mouth of the trailhead. Dude probably wanted to be found, he was in plain view from the path.  She ran into the police officer right around the corner on the main road. I’m not sure if the red tape was his doing, or if another hiker had discovered the body and roped it off while he got help.  

**TL;DR:** Go to suicide forest, expect to see suicides in forest."
"TIFU by trying to walk 2 miles in 122 degree heat.


This actually happened just over 10 years ago, but since reddit is talking about those people dying in the heatwave, it reminded me of this.

So it was Las Vegas around 2000 or 2001 if I remember correctly.  It was 122 degrees that day but it was a ""dry heat""  :P  (sorry, had to put that joke in there)  

Well, my car was at the repair shop and they called for me to come pick it up.  The shop was only 2 miles away, but at the time, I didn't think it was 2 miles.  I thought it was ""like a 5 or 10 minute walk""  It would only be later when I actually drove it to see how far it was that I would find out it was two miles.   So I grabbed a 12 oz soda (because you gotta stay hyrdrated, right?) and went on my way.  I walked barely a few hundred feet before I started feeling thirsty, so I cracked open the soda.  It was finished before I was even half a mile into my journey.  This is where I thought about turning back home, but then I thought ""well, I told them I was coming and I really need my car"" so I kept walking.  3/4 of a mile in and I'm realizing this wasn't a good idea.  And then this is when the REALLY bad idea came.  It was taking so long for me to walk there, I said ""if I run, I'll get there faster""   Now it's not really a good idea to run in 122 degree heat and its not a good idea to run after you just downed a soda, but I did it anyway.  I'm about to cross Sahara Blvd and I notice everyone in their cars are looking at me.  Some laughing, and some mouthing the words ""oh my God!""  I just kind of smiled and kept going.

I'm now a little more than half way and I'm completely out of energy, but the sun is beating down on me and at this point I just want to find some shade.  I have also stopped running because I cant really catch my breath.  Every breath in is hot air.  I see two small trees, but they seem so far away although they are probably only 100 feet away.  I really just want to stop walking completely, but the sun is so painful on my skin (I was wearing a tank top) that I had to keep going.  I get to the shade and spent about 30 minutes there just trying to catch my breath.  

I'm now extremely thirsty, extremely hot and I'm finding it odd that I'm not sweating.  I really feel like I'm going to pass out, but I know I'm really close to the mechanic.  I'm trying to walk, but my feet are starting to ignore my brain's command to keep walking.  I say to myself ""come on, just walk 5 more feet""  as soon as I walk those 5 feet, I stop and rest, but my heart just wont stop pounding even after I've rested.  I'm also finding it odd that I can't seem to walk in a straight line.  I'm weaving back and forth on the sidewalk like a drunk person.   

Somehow, I finally get to the mechanic and I see a hose on the side of the building.  I go and turn it on and start drinking.  Best tasting hose water I ever had.  I sprayed the water over my head and it felt so cool.  I'm not sure how long I was drinking the water for, but it felt like a long time.   I checked my watch and it took me 1 hour 45 minutes to walk those two miles.  Funny enough, even after I drank the water and cooled down, I didn't realize the seriousness of what could have happened to me until years later.  At the time I felt like ""oh I just got a little hot because of the weather and I was tired because I hadn't exercised in a few months so maybe I was a little more out of shape than I thought"" not realizing that I was literally on deaths door.

TL;DR Got heatstroke in Vegas, almost died and didn't know it."
"TIFU by trying to lose my virginity (NSFW)


This happened this past Friday night/ Saturday morning. 

I always been shy and depressed so talking with people is hard for me. Even harder to talk with women. Plus I don't think of myself as very attractive and thing women wouldn't be interested in my anyways. 

I am 25 and a virgin. I never kissed a girl or even held a girls hand before. So I figured I do what everyone seems to do in the movies and go to a bar and see what happens. I don't drink but I have read it can make you less shy and more out going. What could possible go wrong?

Its Friday evening and I decided to go downtown and find a nice bar with lots of people. Got there around 6 pm and sat down at those stools at the counter. The lady behind the counter asked me what I wanted and since I don't drink I had no idea and just told her this is my first time.

She starts listing off bunch of stuff like beers, cocktails, shots and bunch of other stuff I really can't remember. I figured I would try a little of everything and see what I like.

I started off with a Molsen Canadian. One of the few beers I actually do know. Tasted horrible, they all tasted horrible. But I kept drinking one after the other and just having random beers and shots and cocktails. After the 3rd one I felt a little sick and threw up in the bathroom. Felt much better after puking. 

Its about 1 am, not sure how many drinks I have had. I probably puked about 4 times and still have not chatted with anyone except the lady behind the counter who was the one asking me what I wanted to drink. I trip and my glasses get knocked off as I was making my way to the door. A woman picks them hands puts them on my face and asks me if I was all right. Told her I was fine and just had to much to drink. 

We both head outside and start walking and she asks me where I was headed. Told her I was going the skytrain to go home. She grabs my arm and pulls me towards her and wraps her arm in mine and said the skytrain is closed this late and why don't I just stay the night at her place.

We get to her place and as soon as we walk into her apartment she starts kissing me and I am standing there like an idiot. I never kissed before so didn't really know how to. She happened to guess what I never done this before so she said she would teach me. At this point I am getting excited and nervous at the same time that somehow I will fuck it all up. After some kissing she takes my pants off and I am already hard. She teases me with her tongue then proceeds to give me a blowjob. I take off her shirt and she goes back to blowing me as I tried to take off her bra. Words can't describe the feeling or my emotions as it was finally happening. But it didn't last long as I had just managed to  take her bra off that I felt something run down my penis. I didn't realize what it was until the smell hit me. She had puked on me while giving me a blowjob. The smell and the sight of her puking soon took over me and I also vomited all over her head.

I pulled up my vomit covered pants and ran to the bathroom and quickly got into the shower. Started to wash myself and my clothes the best I could. She having taken off all her clothes came into the shower with me and apologized repeatedly as I did the same.

I got out quickly, grabbed my stuff and left as she was still in the shower. Its about 3 am maybe and since no trains were running I walked around in the cold, rainy night.

Once I finally got home I quickly took another shower for god knows how long. Luckily it was a Saturday and my family was still asleep. Went to my room and passed out.

I wake up to my phone ringing but I couldn't move my body. I just laid there on the bed with my eyes closed and a massive headache. My whole body was in pain. I eventually fell back asleep and just woke up few hours ago. I took another shower and when I got to back to my room I noticed I had about 4 calls from her and dozen or so text messages. I don't remember giving her my phone number so not sure how she got it. The texts all were basically her apologizing and wanting to make it up to me. I  have yet to respond and don't really know what to say.

TL;DR: Lonely virgin. Got drunk. Met a girl. Things got wet, really wet.


Edit: I was pasted out for maybe 30 hours. By the time I saw her missed calls and texts it was around 10:30 pm and didn't want to call her in case she is sleeping. Pretty sure she has work in the morning. I do plan on calling her tomorrow.

Also I left without saying anything because I never been in such a situation and was just overwhelmed with fear. For what, I don't really know. I never drank before and had no idea what was happening. I tend to over think everything. All I remember when I left was fear that this wasn't my house and I would get charged for breaking in or something. I really didn't remember much until I read those texts. I am surprised I even remember anything since I read drinking to much can make you forget things.


-- As for being confident, that was taken away from me long time ago. Few years back I tried random apps to meeting people since it was easier for me to chat to people through text. I didn't get any replies for a period of few months. So I decided to simple remove my pictures and descriptions of me and somehow I met tons of girls on apps and online. How ever when they asked to see me and I showed them a pic of myself they stopped responding. Not even gradually less talking over time, nope, just a dead stop in replies after they saw my pic. I don't know if its because of me being unattractive or because of the color of my skin or whatever. I simply decided to not show pics of myself and didn't say the color of my skin and just told them I wasn't ready. I figured if they got to know the real me things would be different. Some pressured me and I just told them I didn't want to say. Some where okay with it and others weren't. Those that were, we chatted for months, a few even chatting online and text for years. After chatting with them for this long I thought they obliviously like me for me, why else would they chat with me for thing long? So I decided to tell them and what happened? The exact same thing that always happened. They stopped responding. For someone to throw away months and even years of being friends simply because of they way you look takes a huge fucking hit to your confidence. 

Out of all those years of chatting, only two didn't judge me and still talked to me. And those two people I considered my best friends. Those two gave me a reason to keep trying. They mean everything to me.

Also I wasn't trying to hook up with any of them. Just needed someone to talk to and from there see how things go. They all know I was talking to multiple people as I told them. I believe in being honest is one of the most important things. --

"TIFU by forgetting to cleanup after masturbating (NSFW)


Lets get right into it. I was home alone and decided it was a convenient time to have some fun. I had heard my friends talking about the “mattress baggie” masturbation trick. To sum it up quickly, you put on a condom and penetrate the spot between the mattress and box spring. Sounds weird, I know. 

Anyways, so I decided to give it a try but my bed was way too low. On the other hand, my sister’s bed was the perfect height. There was no turning back and I went forward with it. It was amazing and I went to bed afterwards, waking up two hours later to the sound of my mother and father screaming. They were in my little sister’s room so I ran over and that’s when I realized what had happened. My mom was holding a cum filled condom that she found **on** my sisters dresser. That’s when I realized I had forgotten to clean up. My father got a baseball bat and was heading towards the neighbors house. They were undergoing construction and my parents came up with the thought that one of the contractors snuck into our house and masturbated in my little sisters room. 

That’s when I had to explain everything to them. It was the most awkward moment of my life and I’m literally cringing while typing this. Imagine telling your parents that you just masterbated with a condom in your little sisters room (I left out the fact that I just fucked a mattress). Needless to say, we never spoke about it again. 

TL;DR masturbated with a condom in my little sisters room and parents almost called the cops

Edit 1: no i'm not a pedo. My sisters been staying at my grandmothers house for over a year. Room is practically empty.

Edit 2: Popular question, my little sister is staying at my grandmothers house because she has special needs and my parents work forces them to move a lot. 

Edit 3: The infamous drawer in my sisters room is visible as you walk past the room. I'm guessing they noticed the condom on top of it while walking by to their room. 

Edit 4: Yes, I know I fucked up badly by forgetting to cleanup. After I finished, I put the cum filled condom on top of the drawer to go wash my genitals. The plan was to dispose of it afterwards. I don't know how the fuck I forgot. It was my first time masterbating with a condom. "
"TIFU by playing *Bad Boys* during a traffic stop


This morning I was driving to work in a happy mood since it is pay day.  I was in a rush and was pulled over for speeding in a zone that was being prepared for construction.  Thinking I could lighten the mood, I remembered Gabriel Iglesias' special and threw on *Bad Boys*.  The officer came up to the car, and the first thing out of his mouth was, ""so you think you're funny, huh?"" (In a very humorous tone I might add) .  I completely misread that, thinking he's seen the comedy special, and responded with a sarcastic yes (more like a flamboyant ""absolutely"").  The cop takes my info and comes back with a max fine ticket, and tells me to get on my way.  

TL;DR Played *Bad Boys* to a cop during a traffic stop and basically negated payday with my new ticket.

*MEGA EDIT: Since some people aren't understanding this all correctly, I will explain some more. I get that I was in the wrong, I'm not fighting to get the ticket off completely, I'm fighting to have the ticket reduced from a double fine. The ""construction zone"" rule should not have been enforced because it was not in the time parameter. Yes, I should be fined $150 for speeding, I am fine with that. No, he should not have issued me a $300 ticket for speeding in a construction zone. I called the police headquarters and just got out of a meeting with the sheriff and my cousin (who is an officer in the same department) and they agree with me, the evidence is on my side. I don't hate construction workers and I was not trying to be an ass, I was going the flow of traffic.  This argument is taking away from the original intent of the post, and yes, he did appreciate the song after the fact, but me playing the song took me from a warning to a ticket as well ($25 infraction for the song)*

**Wow front page! Guess it was worth it to get ticketed 😂**"
"TIFU NSFW by touching a table saw blade.


I was working in my shop making a cut I've made 100's of times. I f'ed up by using a dull blade and putting my hand over the blade when making the cut. 

So I was making a groove cut with a 1/4"" wide dado blade that was 1/2"" above the table. Cutting a groove on a 1"" wide board. Push stick in my right hand. None in my left. My left hand was guiding the front of the board.  Near the middle of the cut, the board kicked back and my finger dropped onto the blade. 

Could have been prevented if I followed my own safety rules about not putting my hand over top of the blade. Also could have been prevented if I had a SawStop table saw. 

My wound is 1/4"" wide and 3/8""-1/2"" deep in the left side of my middle finger between the first and second knuckle. Bone is exposed. Doctor and hand surgeon seems to think it will heal fine. We shall see. [The Wound](https://imgur.com/gallery/7waLK) "
"TIFU by missing two airplanes on the same day...with my girlfriend.


This has to be the most embarrasing fuck up of my life and certainly most expensive one. Girlfriend and I both just want to crawl under a blanket because of this fiasco and not come out, ever.


So the story starts with me and my girlfriend, who lives in Russia. I came here to see her and we were supposed to fly from Moscow to the other side of Russia to meet her relatives. Unfortunately there's a ton of other tickets we were supposed to manage and we noticed (too late) that we had bought tickets to 24th of June at 0:05, instead of at 23:55. We were both under impression that the tickets were very late on 24th. We were bying them over skype one late evening and apparently both of us were too tired to properly double check, while thinking the other one of us did. Surprise: we didn't.



That's TIFU #1. Here comes the second one. We got upset that we had missed our flight, so we decided to buy new tickets. We decided on getting them for this night since we already had all our stuff packed. Unfortunately, we had some trouble with bank cards and had extra hassle with that. Time was lost, and we got into a hurry purchasing new tickets. We bought tickets, took our stuff and headed to the airport. Afraid we'd be late we took a train, more expensive, but at least more certain. Arrived to airport, stood in line to register on the flight and give in our luggage. Then we hear we're not on the passanger list. We thought it could be because we bought the tickets so late, so we went to ticket office and then we find out that in our hurry we bought the wrong tickets. Somehow the online ticket software easily switches the month and we didn't notice. So now we were stuck on an airport at midnight with no easy way out of there and with this ticket fiasco. We exhanged the tickets for tomorrow, but that wasn't cheap: cost us about 300€ to get the new tickets.


We were then at the airport informing our relatives of our screw up. They too lost their night sleep over our mess up. We got back to our apartments only at 6am. It was a long bus drive with a cursing drunkard. Being very tired and miserable we decided to share this embarrasement with the rest of the world.


Tl;dr: Bought tickets for the wrong time. Tried to get back on schedule by buying other tickets, but purchased them for wrong time again. 

   
**Edit:** Whoa! We weren't expecting to get this many replies. Thank you for comments and encouraging words you guys! Lots of interesting stories. We are back at the airport again, so no time to reply back for a while. 


Btw: some of you are serious grammar-natzies and what's with all the relationship advice? Also, NO, she's not a mail order bride!


**Edit2:** We got safely where we were supposed to get. Internet is something of a scarcity in here. We've gotten at least partly over our goof-ups and are doing well - trying to enjoy a chilly siberian summer day. Thanks again for replies! ^^"
