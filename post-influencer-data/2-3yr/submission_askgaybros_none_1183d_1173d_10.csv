"To all those who think Trump is on your side...his meeting with HUNDREDS of anti-gay individuals says otherwise:


http://time.com/4343321/donald-trump-evangelical-social-conservative-meeting/

http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/06/21/lgbt-friend-donald-trump-will-meet-with-dozens-of-anti-gay-christian-leaders-today/

Some highlights: 
&gt;Former presidential candidate Ben Carson is working with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and Bill Dallas, who leads United in Purpose, to plan a closed-door session for about 400 social conservative leaders to meet with Trump in the coming weeks in New York City. A broader steering group of about 20 people includes people like American Values president Gary Bauer, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats.

Don't let fear and cowardice reverse all the rights we fought so hard for. Make no mistake, Trump has repeatedly stated he would find a way to repeal gay rights. The right is no friend of LGBT people and history has shown that over and over. Its pretty disgusting that they're using a national tragedy to try and win support. Remember that their stance is not about supporting you, its about preventing gun control measures.

"[UPDATE] (mostly) straight guy falling for another (mostly) straight guy?


[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4nuswx/mostly_straight_guy_falling_for_another_mostly/)

so, last night i spat my heart out. he came over, we ordered some pizza, watched some shows and just hung out. we were sitting on my couch, i was sitting there nervously because i was afraid of how he was going to react. i cleared my throat and looked at him, he just smiled goofily and asked "" what?""

i took a deep breath and said ""look, we've been doing this for quite some time, and i feel like there's more, you know... i really like you, not just physically. i want to make us exclusive"" i admit it, i came on too strong, i ended it with a nervous laughter.

he shifted his eyes and just froze for a second, i was so worried when i saw him like that. he was completely overwhelmed by what i just said.

i just sat there, waiting for him to answer. he looked at me and just basically told me that this wasn't exactly what he wanted in his life, he told me that he wanted to be married to a woman and have kids in he future. he kept sitting there with his head down, he couldn't even look at me in the face, i knew he was fighting with himself.

i was heartbroken but there wasn't much i could do. i sighed and said ""take your time"" i knew that wasn't the best response but i don't know what else i could say. he nodded and asked me if he still could stay the night. i said off course, he's too much of a pussy to go back to his place by himself at that hour lol.

he slept on the couch last night, not on my bed like we usually do. i couldn't really sleep because i thought this could be the end of our relationship. but i still fell asleep eventually and woke up to some sizzling noise. it was him, making some breakfast. that made me wonder, what was still he doing here? i mean, i kind of expected him to go from my place since we had that unpleasant conversation.

instead, he looked at me, smiling ""hi"" he said from the kitchen area where he could see me (i live in a studio apartment). i honestly was confused, was he pretending that he didn't blew me off last night? i frowned and got up from my bed ""hi."" i said back to him. he made some grilled cheese and put them on the table. he sat down and looked at me ""hey, can we talk... again?"" he asked. i nodded and sat down across from him, grabbing a piece of what he just made.

he cleared his throat and said ""look, about yesterday. i didn't see that coming..."" i stopped chewing and looked at him ""but, since you're brave enough to take our thing further, then i have to be able to match you, because i want it too."" i raised my eyebrows, i was very very thrilled. i chuckled, grabbing his hand and rub it with my thumb. i can't stop smiling remembering those words he said to me.

he then asked about how are we going to do with our family and friends. and to quote jaime lannister i said ""fuck everyone who isn't us."" he just chuckled ""also, we have time to figure things out.""

so, there's that the update. also, for those who say ""they're not really your friends if they don't accept you."" i understand that, but like 95% of the people in this country are homophobic, finding friends that really accept you when it comes to this is like finding a needle in a haystack and i don't think i can bear living without any friend, so please understand why we're still in the closet.

other than that, yeah, we're dating now.

tl;dr : we're dating now.

"My gay son and his health and safety.


OK, so I didn't know where else to ask about this. I hope it's OK for this sub. My son is 17 years old and gay. There's no problem with that, he came out when he was 13, and his mother and I just want him to have happy healthy relationships with whoever he loves.

We've recently discovered that he's purchased dildos off Amazon. Large dildos. Very large dildos. I'd say 16 inches long and the girth of soda can. 

He's not the most careful or cleanest boy and I'm worried about him injuring himself. I'm not sure how to bring this up or what advice to offer, as this is a bit outside of my wheelhouse. He has never had a boyfriend and I'm fairly certain he's never been intimate with anyone. He's pretty shy and we live in a fairly conservative suburb, so I believe his only experience with penetration is from toys.


What should I be worried about? Can he hurt himself? How should he be cleaning these? What are the dangers here?

Edit: wow, I wasn't expecting such a response. I just came back to reddit to find overflowing inbox. Thank you everyone who responded. There is a ton of great advice here and, yeah, I know the situation is kind of funny. That said, given his age and relative inexperience his mother and I have decided to sit down and talk to him about it, present our concerns, make sure he knows the importance of proper hygiene and cleanliness and leave it at that. Thanks so much for the help and the warm welcome here. Wish me luck!"
"Any sad UK bros need a shoulder to cry on?


Send me a dick pic "
"He’s 40 and looks 22, is this a joke?


I met him on grindr, his profile said 40 years old. I messaged him saying “wow you look so young for your age” he said “thanks, I keep a healthy life” and we got talking. Eventually we met up, he invited me back to his house, he took me into his “spare room” which looked like a sons room (because his room was under decoration), we fucked he called me daddy which was weird because I am 35. Now I honestly I keep thinking he played me because his face looked so young (not teenage young, but no more than say 25) there were no wrinkles but he didn’t look botoxed. I’m starting to think I fucked an 20 year old in his parents house. "
"I'm a closeted gay male who is married to a woman. I also have two children. I don't want to tear apart my family but I'm tired of living a lie. What should I do?


I'm a 42 year old male and I've been married to my wife for 12 years now. The kids are 11 and 8. My family has no idea at all that I am secretly gay. My wife and I rarely have sex, but she doesn't seem to mind too much. She thinks it's normal to have less sex when you've been married for a long time. That might be true but that isn't the reason why we haven't been intimate as much as we used to. The truth is, every time we make love, I have to imagine I'm having sex with a man to make it remotely enjoyable for me. When I wake up in the morning and turn around, I secretly wish there was a man lying next to me in her place. I see her as my best friend instead of my lover. I try to keep myself satiated by watching gay porn in secret whenever my wife and kids aren't around (which isn't very often). I can't stop thinking about trying to hook up with another dude for one night without the wife and kids finding out. I get a near instantaneous hard-on when I think about it. I haven't done it yet because I have been putting their happiness ahead of my own. The desire for gay sex is becoming overwhelming for me. Just watching gay porn isn't enough for me. Are there any other men out there in the closet who are married with kids? How do you deal with it?"
"Has anyone else tried a season of ""friends only?"" I've had some really interesting results.


So, a few months ago, I started getting tired of one-off dates an hook-ups. Some guys felt like they could be a good match, but maybe timing was off for one of us or one of us would be more eager to start something when the other was more hesitant.

With that in mind, I decided to change my app statuses to ""friends only"" and said that I wasn't looking to date or hookup, but just looking for new people to get to drink with or hike with. I honestly thought that would kill the responses I'd get since most guys are either looking for hookup or LTR possibility or GTFO. Surprisingly, I started getting a few guys a week who wanted the same thing. Some were new to the city. Some were just out of relationship and trying to build some new friends after being off the radar. Others were just gregarious types that liked new people.

I wasn't hardcore about no sex, but I stuck to not hooking up on first meetup (fairly well; I'm not a saint). It was interesting since it forced the interaction to really be about shared interests and finding things to do that weren't just about prepping to head home together. A couple of the guys were on gay sports leagues, so I got to go watch some games. Others had museums and city stuff they wanted to check off a bucket list, so I'd tag along to that.

After a couple months, I suddenly have a bigger gay network. Guys would introduce me to friends and bring others along to the activities; two things that never happen if you're just meeting for dates and hookups. Now that I've developed this network, I'm starting to recognize people that would be a good dating match in a much more natural way. We've hung out organically without trying to figure out from a list of interests on an app if we're compatible. Also, recognizing who's attractive as a combo of looks and personality. It's like I'm noticing guys who are handsome and very attractive with the personality they have attached, but they wouldn't have been the first person I clicked on an app. They'll be plenty close to my ideal type, but not like a cartoon of it, which I can be a sucker for when going purely by looks. It also ends up shifting my ""ideal"" type since I realize half of that is a jerking off type that I can take or leave really.

The one other good thing I've figured out when it comes to gay friends is that it can be easier and better to bond with people who share your type, but aren't your type. It takes that edge off wondering if you'll hook up and makes for a great wingman. Me and one of my good friends now know right away that we just aren't each others' type, but we love heading to the same parties that will have the type of guy there we really like. It's starting to fix this problem I'd have of trying to find friends, but going by who I was most attracted to. When it comes to straight friends, none are the type I'm attracted to and there's probably a good reason we're good friends with that component removed."
"If you could self-suck, would you?


Hi, I'm 20 and bisexual, I have been self sucking for years and often cum in my mouth. A guy I know called me weird.

So, GayBros, would you suck yourself if you could?"
