This is an update post! Hello everyone! I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice.

Anyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier.
I told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the ""he has work"" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad.

So anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said ""Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad"". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it &amp; that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do.

A few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if ""things got bad"". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her ""you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!"" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said ""if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!"" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said ""I have never seen you so angry!""

I never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :)

Tldr; they broke up!

Edit: HOLY SHIT this blew up!! I'm at work so I can't read or answer much of the replies but I'll get to everyone tonight hopefully! &amp; for all those who are wondering- yes it was pinch not punch. No typo there! Thanks everyone for the support its amazing to hear! :)"

"[UPDATE] I[29F] feel like I'm wasting my life by staying with my husband [29M]


I have a mini update to my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4xmc3v/i_29f_feel_like_im_wasting_my_life_by_staying/).


I just wanted to say thanks to those of you who commented. I read them all but only got back to the first few who wrote in because yesterday turned into a shit show. 


In the morning I said I wanted to go off and do my own thing (it was actually just running errands) for an hour or so alone. He said he had shit to do. Whatever...too early for me to be pissed off, so I dropped it.


I asked again later, suggested he take our child to the park next to us since she's always asking to do stuff with daddy instead of me. Again...said no, he was going to do stuff with his hobby.


So, I broke down. I told him I needed help and that I *needed* a break from just being stuck at home 24/7 being a mom and wife. His response was that he didn't understand why I needed a break, but if I did I could just hang out in my room alone to get away from our child and him. And then asked me to make him lunch. 


I think it's too late for the come to Jesus talk. I have no fucks left to give, obviously he never had any. I'm still not sure what my next move is, but I think it involves finding a job and starting a better future without him. 


TL;DR: Thanks for the comments on the first post, things are a little clearer now. "
"My gf [24 F] of 3 months never cuddles with me [27 M] since she has always been a ""non-cuddler"" and when we recently went on vacation she slept on the spare bed in the hotel room to avoid sleeping with me.


This is an update post! this is probably the quickest update ever but it's such a happy update that I just want to share with everyone :)

Original post: https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x58pn/my_gf_24_f_of_3_months_never_cuddles_with_me_27_m/d6dk9f4?context=3

So I read a lot of the advice and decided that I was going to talk to her about a possible break up. I know this makes me sound like a shit person but honestly I'm just a very touchy guy and express my affection by touching and being touched. Not being able to cuddle or hold hands or sleep next to my girlfriend was not going to work out for me and just felt like a constant tease you'd get from a long distance relationship where you'd think about holding and cuddling your gal or guy but just don't end up doing it. Honestly it was not gonna work out. 

I brought my gf to my house after telling her we had to chat. I started by telling her that I'm really sorry and like her very much but I don't think things will work out with our different cuddling preferences. She started crying and said she didn't want me to be turned off by this but she actually loves cuddling but has a ""sweating disorder"" and when she cuddles she gets super sweaty like I'm talking hella sweaty. She said her ex boyfriend dumped her because of her sweating and she said that's why she didn't want to cuddle with me. She said the same thing happens when she holds hands and she gets super sweaty. She said she was afraid cuddling with me would make me leave her like with her ex in the past.

I felt bad that I've been giving her so much shit about it and it was like an insecurity she had and I told her that I don't really care if she sweats on me its all good. She laughed and said ""no I actually sweat buckets"" and I told her ""can you sweat buckets on me?"" :P she thought about it and then she said ""okay but don't break up with me over it if I sweat too much!"" In a joking voice. 

She layed beside me and we cuddled and it felt so fucking good to finally feel that with her. She actually managed to sweat so much that my shirt was pretty wet and the bed sheet was soaked and I told her that I found it pretty cool. She said that she is so happy that someone appreciates cuddles and doesn't mind the sweating and I was just so happy we were finally cuddling. I told her I didn't mind getting soaked cuddling and said ""at least now we can have kisses in the rain in bed"" and she couldn't stop laughing. She asked if we could hold hands in bed to show me how sweaty her hands get and again my hands were wet as hell which I didn't mind. She said ""if you ever need to wash your hands and there's no sink available just hold my hands!"" Which was really cute.

It's been an amazing day and I'm just really happy things worked out. I told her that if she felt like things her ex said to her were hurting her and still making her feel insecure she should really consider maybe seeing a therapist to help her feel more comfortable. She agreed and said that the fact that I like her sweating lifted a burden off her shoulders since she loves cuddles. Hopefully all goes well!

Tldr; she is an excessive sweater that's all :P"
"[UPDATE] My [19F] manager [25M] had unlocked my phone and was recording a private video of me and my partner onto his own phone, and I caught him


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4skueq/my_19f_manager_25m_had_unlocked_my_phone_and_was/

Hello everyone. First of all, big apologies for how long overdue this update is. Since the rules limit me for one update only I wanted to have the most full outcome to give you. Thank you all so, so much for your help and support and advice, I didn't expect so many people to respond to me and I really am grateful.

Sadly the outcome isn't so happy. My conclusion from the original post was to go to highest management first and then police if the result wasn't satisfactory, which is what I did. 

I went straight to the store manager the morning after my post and was advised to write up and sign a formal grievance, which I did. I then met with two other managers to discuss the details of what happened and any other relevant stuff. They told me they'd talk to the manager in question and any witnesses and get back to me in a week after investigations had taken place. In the meantime, my manager was not allowed to work with me and was told to reschedule all his shifts or work elsewhere. 

A week passed and I heard nothing. When I went to find out, apparently due to staff holidays it couldn't be completed in time. I asked how much longer and was told a week. I felt this was too long and was really restless by this point already and so my boyfriend came with me to speak to the police. 

We explained the situation and my details were taken down and then we met with a sergeant. To summarise, she told us that in the UK there is no specific law against accessing someone's private phone/recording off someone's private phone without permission. As such, they are unable to search his phone as no arrests can be made. The only thing they could do was go to his house and explain it had been reported and that if he ever distributed it he would be arrested, which they did, and he LIED TO THE POLICE and said he hadn't done anything. Sadly, they said there was nothing more they could do.

The internal investigation then concluded and I was told my manager had denied everything, made up a false excuse for the apology text he sent me and basically called me a liar. They told me that there is no CCTV where it happened and nobody who was in the area at the time saw anything (no shit, they were the complete opposite end of the room, as I had already explained). They tried to say they weren't taking sides, but to be honest it seemed like they were. They're moving ME from the department instead of him, because moving him is ""harder"". I really enjoyed my job and now basically I have to suffer because my manager is a disgusting liar. They don't seem to care how serious this is. I ended up almost crying when they legitimately said ""maybe you didn't see anything at all"". I feel like they're accusing me of lying and imagining it, even though one of the managers involved was the one that caught me in the corridor bawling my eyes out.

I really wish I could've given a happy update. I'm so upset that I have to move and give up something I enjoy when he gets off without even a slap on the wrist, goes on knowing he can probably do this again to someone else and carry on being the scumbag he is, not to mention, he might still have the videos. He may have distributed them already but how the hell would I know. I have no idea what to do now. The police say nothing else can be done. If anyone has any legal advice around this issue within the UK law then I would be very very grateful for that. 

Sorry for the length, and if it's worded badly. Again, thank you all for your advice. I'm sorry this was a bad update.

tl;dr: Went to higher management and police about how I caught my manager recording a private video from my phone to his phone. He lied to both; management say not enough evidence to do anything, he gets to keep his job but I have to lose mine. Police say nothing can be done due to no UK law surrounding the subject.

Nothing too exciting happened. She got home from work and before I could even bring it up she said she's going to replace everything. Now that she's offered I feel quite a bit better about the entire situation - I'm not going to let her pay for my new clothes **but** she will have to tag-along and help me pick everything out. I know everyone loves a dramatic, juicy update but this is about as mellow as they come. We're going to separate chores going forward though. We each do our own laundry, dishes, etc, and take turns on mowing the grass.



Also, no - she didn't maliciously ruin my clothes with her pen (WTF, Reddit?). Lots of great advice in my previous thread and I'm thankful for that - lots of absolutely terrible advice as well. 


**TL;DR:** Girlfriend offered to replace everything - I declined. She's going to help me pick out new stuff on a shopping trip."

"I [31M] believe that my wife [29F], a former alcoholic, has been drinking during her pregnancy, but I can't prove anything and she denies it. What do I do?


I've been married to my wife for 5 years now, and those 5 years have been a very happy time for both of us--for the most part. The only serious issue we've faced in our marriage has been my wife's struggle with alcoholism. In truth, it started before we were married, but it got worse as time passed until we got to a point a few years ago where my wife would come home from work each night and get absolutely wasted.  There was a significant period of time where not a day went by that she didn't excessively consume alcohol to a point where it interfered with my ability to spend time with her and our marriage. Eventually it began to affect her work performance and other areas of our lives, and after she lost her job and went through a semi-intervention, she realized she needed some help. 

We got her enrolled in a treatment program and she was able to get to the root of the problem--that her coping mechanism for stress and anxiety was alcohol. She struggled at first with staying sober, but after many months of counseling and therapy (and lots of hard work on my wife's part), she was able to gain her sobriety. Since that point 2 and 1/2 years ago my wife has been completely sober, and our lives have been good. My wife has since found another job in her field and is in a position similar to the one she had before she was fired. We're also currently in the process of having a child that was very much wanted and planned; my wife is currently 10 weeks pregnant. This should be a very happy time for us (and it is for the most part), but I've started suspecting that she's relapsed and has started drinking again. It's either that or I am going crazy. 

This all started when I found an empty wine bottle tucked behind some boxes in our hall closet several weeks ago; it was about a week after we found out my wife was pregnant. It seemed very odd to me because (a) it was very out of place in the closet; (b) we haven't had wine or wine bottle in our house since my wife started her treatment program; and (c) I don't remember it being there ever before this. We also have never kept empty wine bottle for reuse either, so there's no reason for why it should be there. 

I casually mentioned it to my wife, and she acted surprised. She said it must have been something we stored and forgot, and she claimed to have no idea when we put it there. It was suspicious, but I believed her. 

Almost two weeks later I discovered another wine bottle, but this one was buried at the bottom of our outside trash can. Again, something didn't seem right to me. I always take the trash out, and I don't remember it being there a few days earlier. Since it was at the bottom, I would have had to have seen it at some point unless it was hidden after the can was filled up, but then why would someone go through the effort of stuffing a bottle at the bottom of the trash can unless they wanted to hide it? I certainly didn't put it in myself, so I knew it had to be someone else or my wife. 

I took it out and showed it to her, and this time she got upset. She asked me what I was trying to imply, and I told her I was curious and possibly concerned. I didn't accuse her of anything, but she came right out and told me that she wasn't drinking and that it was the same bottle I found two weeks earlier. I could almost swear that it was different because I'm fairly certain they had different labels, but since I didn't throw the other one out, I don't know for sure. I thought it was odd that she would wait so long, but I didn't have anything to prove she was lying. 

I noticed after that fight that my wife seemed more on edge and very jittery, and I also noticed at times her behavior was odd in other ways (e.g. she started questioning me a lot more about when I would be home if I was out and would randomly call me sometimes to make sure I was still going to be home exactly when I was, and if I got home a little early, she would be upset with me). I also started to notice that after she went into the bathroom for a while some nights she would come back more relaxed and sometimes almost like a person who is tipsy. I did take a quick glance at the bathroom, but I didn't find anything.   

Then finally the last straw (and what made me post here) came earlier this week. I was coming home from work, and I again got a random call from my wife asking if I was going to be late or what time exactly I would get home. I probably should have done this, but I lied and told her I expected to be about an hour late. I decided to park a little way down the street instead of our driveway and walk home and surprise my wife. She must have heard me come in because I saw her run into her into our bedroom and heard her shut the closet door. 

I'm going to try to condense this last part because this post is already too long. I caught up to her and asked her what what going on and she got very upset immediately. I asked her why she ran into the closet, and she denied going into it. I knew she was lying because I heard two doors close (our bedroom and the closet). I went into the closet and eventually found a bottle of wine hidden under some clothes. We had a big fight about it. I asked her if she was drinking again, and she denied it completely. She claimed that she had bought it as a gift for her friend but hid it because she knew I would think she was drinking, and that's where we are now.

She's still pissed because she thinks I don't trust her and consider her to be the type of woman that would drink while pregnant. I've told her constantly that I'm not judging her. I just want to do the right thing for her and the baby so if something is going on I would rather her be honest with me instead of hide it from me.

Nothing adds up to me. Everything points to her drinking again, but none of what I've found proves anything. The empty bottle I found could have been stored there by accident and forgotten by me. Maybe the bottle I found in the trash was the same one. The bottle I found in our closet didn't look like anything had been drunk from it, so maybe she is telling the truth. Maybe the other odd behavior is just stress or related to the pregnancy in another way. I want to believe her, but my gut tells me something isn't right. I'd like to know what third parties think. Do I have a reason to be concerned about a relapse, or am I paranoid and imagining things?



---   
**tl;dr**: My former alcoholic wife has been acting strange lately. I've found several wine bottles in places so odd that it makes me think she has started drinking again. I found another she hide from me that was full or nearly full, but she claimed she bought it for a friend and hid it from me because she thought I would think she was drinking again. Everything points to her drinking, but I can't prove anything. She thinks I am being paranoid, and I feel that way at times, but am I? She is pregnant right now, so I'm extra worried that the stress has caused her to relapse and she's going to hurt herself and the baby if something isn't done soon!

Update: I just wanted to thank you all for taking the time to respond and offer suggestions and for the support. I contacted my wife's OB/GYN today and let him know about the situation. He shared some resources with me related to FAS to share with my wife, and he told me that he would do everything in his power to help my wife. I have not had a chance to search the house for alcohol yet, but I'm going to try to do it discretely tonight. Then I'm going to confront my wife either way. I don't know exactly what I'm going to say to her, but my goal is to get her to understand that we can get her help for this but I'm not going to stay silent and let her hurt our child. I still think we can be happy together, but if the child is born with FAS or she continues to drink, it won't be possible. The only way this can work is if she gets help and stops lying. I also read the comments about termination. As hard as it is to admit, I think it may be the best thing. Clearly we're not ready to have a child right now, and I think going forward with this pregnancy would only hurt 3 people instead of just two people being hurt. If she really has relapsed, even if our baby is healthy, I don't think she would be able to handle the stress of motherhood and stay sober right now. She needs to get healthy first.      "

**OP TL;DR: [My supervisor is stealing but I can't talk to the owner about it. I tried to blow the whistle and now I'm being met with reprisal.] (https://nr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lc5eo/my_30f_immediate_supervisor_35f_is_stealing_from/)**

I didn't know this at the time but while I was making that post, my boss was having an emergency c-section!  The twins were a few weeks early but overall in good health and were discharged the following week.  They are doing well and are adorable.   

My boss started work again about a month ago (she lives super close to the office and hired a nanny for the twins).  I asked to speak with her and showed her all of the documentation I'd collected.  She was taken aback (like, really shocked!) and then started asking me questions - I gather she'd heard a different story from Candy and she thought maybe *I* was stealing.  But here is the thing: I can't steal the way Candy was stealing.  She was writing and signing checks to herself to give herself pay check advances.  I can't sign checks.  She was pulling out money from the ATM.  I don't have the debit card OR the PIN for the account.  I pointed that out, and reiterated the proof, letting my boss know whatever she needed, I would try to help her with, but that the situation was untenable as it was and I had been looking for other work because I didn't want to stay at the position, working under Candy. 

Boss took a few days to think things over and verified what I'd said.  She checked in with payroll processor and, no, Candy wasn't taking the ""advances"" out.  She checked in with the bank and not only was there ATM footage of Candy withdrawing cash, the bank also brought to Boss's attention a slew of checks that Candy had written to herself and signed, but that were in my Quickbooks as checks to vendors.  So that's another reason why she didn't want to me to log into the bank account online, I would have been able to see the check images.  

Needless to say, Boss confronted Candy.  The story from Candy was 

- Kiki (me) is the one stealing (then boss showed her images of herself taking money out of ATM, reprints of checks made out to herself and signed, etc.)

- That turned into Candy saying she's a pill addict and this is because of her addiction and blah blah.  She might be a pill addict, I don't know.  But the total of theft that we found (with the bank etc) was over $30,000 in a little over 3 months.  So... would a pillhead with that kind of money even be alive still?  Anyway, the last one is the best one, IMO

- I DROVE HER TO ABUSE PAIN PILLS BECAUSE I WAS SO MEAN TO HER AND FRAMING HER FOR MY OWN THEFT.  Which again, go back to the first bullet re: ""my own theft"".  But also, she was HORRIBLE to me in the last few months.  She brought a buzzer in from a game and would literally buzz it at me anytime I tried to talk to her and she didn't want to listen.  She made a big deal about locking up her purse around me.  I'm pretty sure she was letting air out of my tires because I kept leaving work to find flats.  She also was openly being like ""you are such a bitch"", ""wipe that face of your head, bitch"" etc.   So that was pretty rich.  

Boss fired Candy.  She thanked me for bringing it to her attention.  I didn't have the heart to say ""well, your husband knew about it at least 2 months ago"" I wonder if he just never told her and acted surprised when she came home to tell him?  Anyway, the silveriest of linings to this story is:  I started applying for jobs and got one, that pays roughly one and a half times what my current job pays!  So I gave notice today.

"Updated: I [20M] recently found out my girlfriend of 6 years [19F] has been a cam girl for 9 months to help fund her ""education"".


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wguxk/i_20m_recently_found_out_my_girlfriend_of_6_years/

First of all I would like to say thank you for the helpful answers I received in my first post, and would also like to thank the people who respectfully disagreed with me. I would also like to apologise for getting angry at the people who tried to insult me for my opinion, but getting told ""she's better off without you"" etc when I feel like I've done nothing wrong is a low blow.

So on to the update. Last night I decided late on I'd go to a party where people I went to school with etc were at one of my old friends houses. The awkward thing though is I didn't know Alison would be there, who is Sophie's best friend from our area.

Me and Alison have always gotten along really, we were never particularly close but we've never had a problem with each other. She saw me and told me that whilst she doesn't agree with the camming behind my back (apparently she's known for awhile) and told Sophie to tell me, she's upset that we split up and so is Sophie.

I told Alison that it's more than just being a cam girl, it's the fact I didn't have the choice to be OK with it, the fact she's doing it and blowing it on drink and whatever else on a weekend and how I felt undervalued that she would prefer to make money this way than try to save our relationship.

Alison said she could see my point but Sophie sees it differently according to her and thinks that I should be OK with it because I never knew what was going on and it didn't effect me in anyway. I said that people being physically cheated on don't know what's going on, but it still effects them, this is how I felt and that I obviously valued sex differently to Sophie these days. That it would be best to go no contact to save us heart ache as we've obviously developed into two different people, and if Alison could tell her that, that would be great.

Just about 25 minutes ago I received a text from Alison saying that she told Sophie what I'd said, and Sophie said that it's her body she can do what she wants and that shouldn't concern me, that I'm being an idiot and should just accept ""that she makes more money doing this than I ever could to support herself"" (she showed me the text). Alison apparently unleashed on her because of how selfish she thought that was by Sophie, and I got the answer I needed in full, this isn't the same person I dated for 6 years. I've noticed changes slowly during University in her that I've ignored until now, but I feel like I just stayed with her because I loved her former self.

So now I'm single for the first time in my adult life, I'm going to do things I've missed out on considering my friends have always called me ""whipped"" and actually be one of the ""lads"".

---   
**tl;dr**: Went to a party, saw Sophie's best friend who offered to pass on a message to Sophie. Sophie insulted me to Alison saying she makes a lot more money doing this than I could ever provide her plus other things, which made me realise this isn't the same person I love, and even though I'm still upset, I've come to accept that the person I loved doesn't exist anymore."
"UPDATE: I [26F] burnt my face really bad with a curling iron. I work in a corporate office - What should I do?


Here's the link to the original post &gt;&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wszgo/i_26f_burnt_my_face_really_bad_with_a_curling/


Hope I did that right...


On to the update! Again, I want to thank everyone for their advice. I was pretty amazed at all the help and seriously all of your comments were super supportive - Seriously, incredible. Thank you. I was feeling pretty stupid and embarrassed.


So, about an hour after I made the original post I ran out to the pharmacy and got a bunch of Band-Aids and antibiotic cream. (Side note: By this point the burn was raw and borderline an open wound.) My first priority (which I wouldn't have really thought about, thanks to you kind Redditors) was to make sure it didn't scar my face. My game plan was to slap a Band-Aid on it and re-dress the would throughout the day and apply antibiotic cream as needed. I went to work pretty early to get to my office before everyone else, and when people did make comments I was honest that I got attacked by a curling iron, and most of my colleagues just plain felt really bad that I burned my face that badly. I had a meeting today with the big wigs (the CEO, COO, EVP and my boss) and the CEO's first comment when I walked into the room was, ""Well, I hope you look better than the other guy!"" I actually thought it was pretty hilarious and overall the meeting went well, even though I felt INCREDIBLY AWKWARD.


Now onto the not so great news. After the meeting I went to the bathroom to check on the burn. It. Looked. Terrible. I borderline had a panic attack - thought my face was falling off. My boss was super supportive and I ended up leaving and going to urgent care. The doctor said it looked a little infected, but prescribed me some antibiotic/steroid/burn cream that should help the healing process move along a lot quicker. She also advised to NOT put anything over it, no makeup and no Band-Aid! The burn still looks terrible but she said it should heal up nicely over the next 7-days as long as I take care of it. I ended up working from home the rest of the day - it was kind of nice.


So, TIL (for anyone in the future with a raw/open wound burn)...
-Go to the Doctor's RIGHT WAY!!! THIS, THIS, THIS!!!
-Do not cover it with makeup or a Band-Aid, just let it breath
-No one gives a crap at your work about your face, they might feel bad but no one really cares LOL


tl;dr: Went to work with a Band-Aid over it. Colleagues asked what happened, was honest that a curling iron attacked me - played it off lightheartedly. Most of them just felt bad. The meeting with the big wigs went fine. Burn ended up getting infected and I ended up at Urgent Care. Doctor prescribed the APPROPRIATE cream, and I'm not supposed to put makeup or Band-Aids over the wound. Going to work tomorrow - I feel kind of bad people have to look at this hideous thing, but oh well. It does seem like it's healing now!"
"I [25F] am terrified of my new landlord [50sM] and can't tell if I'm being paranoid.


Three weeks ago I moved into an apartment in a new city where I know no one. I found the place after driving by and spotting a For Rent sign.


When I came in to sign the lease, the landlord ""Sal"" told me that he was a full colonel in the army and was a POW for five months in Iraq. He told me about how he escaped and was awarded a medal by the Vice President. I tried to look this up online and there's absolutely nothing. Wouldn't you think there'd be an article or two about a full colonel escaping the clutches of an Iraqi POW camp? But I figured, hey I'm not in the military. What do I know.


After I moved in I started to notice how quiet the building is. At first I thought it was a good thing, but it occurred to me after my second week living here that *I haven't seen a single person besides Sal inside this building.* Each of the 20 mailboxes in the lobby has a tenant name. I snapped a picture of them on my way out this morning and searched every name on Facebook and Google. Not a single one of them has my city listed on their profile: in fact, all of them list Baltimore, Maryland as their current city (thousands of miles from the apartment building). When I searched Sal's full name, he also had Baltimore related things come up.


Sal hasn't done anything outwardly threatening or creepy to me; he's been friendly enough. From day one I sensed that there was something a little ""off"" about him, but I thought maybe he *was* in the military, just not to the extent he told me, and had PTSD or something similar.


But after looking up the other ""tenants"", I am seriously frightened. I called my parents and they seemed to think I was being paranoid. I don't have friends to stay with yet, and I can't afford a hotel for more than a couple of nights.



Am I leaping to wild conclusions, or is there something strange going on here?


**tl;dr:** I'm afraid my new landlord is not who he says he is, and I'm scared.


**Edit:** Sal lives on-site, down the hall from me.

**Update: I'm in a hotel for the night so I can have some time to figure this out without panicking. I'm doing some further internet snooping to see if I can dig up any dirt on Sal. Will keep you posted.**

**UPDATE!!!:** THANK YOU so much to everyone who messaged to check in on me-- I'm okay but the last few days have been really crazy and I haven't been able to log back on. I know we're only allowed one update so I'm waiting until I can give you the whole story. But yes, I'm okay!"
"UPDATE Should I [18 F] go see my [17 F] best friend that I haven't seen in six years even though her almost boyfriend asked me not to?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4wdol5/should_i_18_f_go_see_my_17_f_best_friend_that_i/?st=irtta750&amp;sh=83061d7f

So, shit hit the fan since I last posted. I honestly wasn't planning on posting an update because my last post really didn't get much attention, but today I got a random message from Gwen asking if her mom had invited me to a party. It turns out that Almost-Boyfriend figured making plans with her on the same days I was going to be there wasn't enough, so he told her about the going away party her parents had planned.


I was really annoyed about the whole thing at first because her parents had put so much effort into this party and he ruined the surprise, but then after I told her yes she had a complete meltdown. 


Apparently she had been telling her mom for a while that she did NOT want a surprise party, and her mom decided to just throw one anyways. Now she's not on speaking terms with her parents and is frantically trying to figure out everyone they invited so she can uninvite them.


Anyways, since the cat was already out of the bag about the party I figured I might as well take your guys advice about telling Gwen about what her boyfriend did. I don't know what I was expecting, but she didn't really care. She even told me she was glad I had decided not to go, because she's really looking forward to the weekend with Almost-Boyfriend.


I mean, I'm glad they didn't ""break up"" (if you could even call it that when they're not even dating yet) over me. The guy acted like a douchebag, sure,  but he's usually not like that. I guess I'm just kind of upset that after not seeing me in years her reaction to finding out that her almost boyfriend purposely ruined the one chance we would have had to spend together before she moved off even farther away for college was basically a shrug of the shoulders and a change of topic.


This really opened my eyes to the fact that I think I value her more as a friend than she values me, and that I deserve a lot better than to constantly be caught up in her drama all the time. I've decided I'm going to focus on other friends and leave the ball in her court for now. Maybe this will all blow over if they ever break up, but I'm not holding my breath anymore.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Almost-boyfriend told Gwen about the party and she had an absolute meltdown over it because she had apparently told her mom she didn't want one. I came clean about my original plans to spend the three days with her that almost-boyfriend purposely made plans with her on, and she sided with him. I've decided that Gwen isn't the same person she used to be and this new person isn't someone I want to be associated with so I'm leaving the past in the past and am going to focus on bettering myself and building healthier friendships."
"Was I (24f) wrong to discipline my cousin's(22f) daughter (4f)


A little background here, my whole family has always been the 'odd man out' in our extended family, and even more so my brother (27m) and I. We have very different political and religious views, and escaped our small town to move to a big city. I've also expressed my desire to be child free until at least my 30s and focus on my career, while my cousins got married right out of high school and started having babies. So things tend to be a bit tense anyway.


Yesterday my cousin was over with her two children. They were at an event close to my house and stopped by to use my restroom, change diapers etc. Her oldest daughter, Ruby(4) started playing with one of my cats. This cat is incredibly sweet and calm and I'm actually looking to register him as a therapy animal. However, he does have his claws (which is another thing my family and I disagree on - they've always declawed their cats) and like any animal will get defensive if he is hurt.

Ruby was petting him and started to pull on his tail and pick him up by his front legs. He started mewing and my cousin said in a sing-song baby voice 'Now Ruby, play gentle with kitty.' Ruby ignored her and got more rough, to the point my cat was crying in pain and hissed for maybe the first time in his life. Since my cousin wasn't doing anything, I said in a very stern voice 'Ruby, leave the cat alone. You are hurting him and he is trying to ask you to stop and you're ignoring him. He's going to scratch you.'


This made Ruby extremely pouty and she was sniffling but she stopped. I told her thank you and maybe later she could try to pet him again. My cousin called me into the other room and was FURIOUS, said I had no right to discipline her child, I acted like a bitch when I did, and I wasn't even a parent and didn't know what I was doing. She left shortly after. 


Now I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not. My cousin told the rest of my family and I've been getting angry messages ever since. I don't think this is a situation I'll be in again since I'm sure my cousin won't be coming back. If I end up dealing with this with friend's kids in the future, did I act correctly? Looking for advice. Also I apologize for formatting, on mobile.

Tl;dr: Cousin's daughter was playing rough with cat, she wasn't really stopping her so I stepped in and did. Cousin says it was wrong for me to discipline someone else's child, not sure who is right here


Edit: Wow, I was out for a few hours and got a ton more responses than I expected. Thank you everyone who reassured me!
I've talked to my grandmother since I posted this and when I explained what had actually happened, she basically ignored me and focused on how I need to declaw my cat so he can't scratch. This isn't an option and I made it clear that if they were that worried maybe it was best they not come to my house. I'm sure this will cause other issues but I'm sticking to my guns and protecting my animals. Thank you everyone who has replied so far!


Edit 2: So today I heard second hand (cousin told aunt who told mom who told me) that I had yelled at Ruby and she was only gently petting the cat. She also apparently didn't realize my cats have claws and was upset I didn't warn her when she came over. I would try to explain what really happened except they (aunts family) all blocked me on social media...I'm realizing this problem goes way beyond this one incident and was probably bound to happen sooner or later. Thank you everyone for your support! I feel much better knowing I didn't overstep

Edit 2.2: this isn't the first time my family has been blocked for silly things and apparently my mom made a comment to my aunt about not being ready to be a grandma which, given circumstances, upset my aunt. So things had been boiling for a while in the background that I didn't know about"

"My boyfriend [30M] admitted to ""tracking"" me [27F] on business trips. I feel violated and he thinks he did nothing wrong because it was out of concern.


We've been together 2 years, lived together for about 4 months. 

Anyway, my job requires a lot of travel. I work on a team of 4 people and we often travel once a month for a few days, and every few months for a week. This has always been my job, BF has never voiced any concern about it, and has never said a word about the travel bothering him. I'm always very upfront about where I'm going, how long I'll be gone, and who on the team is going, too. I know he's been mildly suspicious of one of the guys on the team before, but our relationship is purely platonic and has been since my boyfriend and I started dating. No worries there. 

Anyway, last Friday my team and I were all driving back to town after doing some work a few states over. I was texting my boyfriend in the car as I normally do, telling him where we currently were, when I'd be home, just normal chit-chat to pass the time. I told him we were probably going to stop for lunch at this really famous restaurant about 30 miles from where we live. 

So we did that. While we were getting ready to leave, I saw my boyfriend across the street in this little coffee shop/ice cream parlor place. I was really surprised to see him there since it was the middle of the day and he should've been at work. Plus, he had no reason to be there. I thought maybe he had come to surprise me, so I crossed the street and went over to talk to him. When he saw me coming he looked like I had caught him. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was sent on an ""errand"" by his boss to this town. This didn't really sound right to be considering there was nothing in this town that couldn't be accomplished in either our city or in another one much closer. I asked again what he was doing there, this time kinda thinking he hadn't planned on me seeing him. He then said that since we had mentioned stopping in a town so close, he would come meet us and then I could ride home with him so we had time to catch up. Again, weird I thought, especially since he could've told me that. But I dropped it for the time being and we left together.

On the ride back I brought it up again and asked what he was really doing because I really wasn't buying his story. This is when he admitted to me that he often will drive by places I say I am on business trips to see if I'm really there. If we're staying less than 2 or 3 hours away, he'll drive to that town to see if my car is really outside the hotel I'm staying at. If I say we're stopping somewhere on the drive home, he'll go there and see what I'm really doing, if everything is platonic like I say it is, etc.

I feel hugely violated. For one, he has never mentioned feeling so insecure about my relationship with my coworkers. Secondly, he trusts me *so little* that he will drive 2 hours to the Best Western four towns over just to make sure I'm really there when I say I am?! 

*He* says that he's not doing anything wrong. He's not tracking my phone or reading my messages. That it's his right to drive to another town if he wants to, and he's only doing it out of concern for our relationship and its integrity.

I'm not crazy, am I? I think this is totally insane and I'm not sure I want to be in a relationship with someone like that. But he's so insistent that he's done nothing wrong, I don't know. I guess I just need advice on what to do.

"My [30F] MIL [55F] is ruining all the special and fun moments in my life/marriage


My husband's mother has become obsessed with the ""fact"" that we hate her. This started after I got pregnant. The baby is now several months old and MIL's behaviors have been consistently getting worse. Everything we do, even things that have nothing to do with her or the baby, is somehow twisted into a slight against her. She has resorted to constantly lying to various family members about things we have said to her.


My husband and I have both spoken to her several times about all of these issues. She has denied everything, and even said we must have confused her for someone else, and named another family member who she believes we must be thinking of. We have continued to set boundaries, explained why things she does and says are not okay. (She has done a lot more than I'm writing about here.)

The worst part is, she always waits for holidays, birthdays, a celebration, vacation, or any other special occasion to really act up. Sometimes it can also be something as small as her finding out we bought the baby something. (Please note, that her lashing out and lying doesn't just have to do with the baby, it just began once I got pregnant.) So, for example, we were having dinner to celebrate my husband's college graduation, just the two of us. His brother mentioned it to their mom, so he received a long text about how we must hate her and that she isn't good enough to celebrate with. Some holidays we spent with her, some with other family members or just the two of us. When it's not ""her turn"" she will send several ""why do you hate me?!"" texts or calls to my husband, and several to family members making up stories about how we made her cry on such and such holiday.


I don't know what to do anymore. We have spoken to her countless times and set boundaries, but she keeps getting worse. And keep in mind, she's only like this towards us. As holidays are approaching, I'm getting worried. I don't want another year of this.

She has most recently started posting very vague, adolescent quotes and sayings on social media, pertaining to revenge, karma, making sure people get what they deserve for wronging her, etc. I'm horribly stressed about everything. 

My husband thinks ignoring the problems is the solution to this, since talking to her hasn't worked.

What should I do?


Tl;Dr: After getting pregnant, my MIL decided my husband and I hate her, despite us being quite friendly. No matter what we do or say, she isn't happy, and has resorted to telling lies to family members about us. Her being the victim in everything. During holidays, she will keep texting or calling my husband with guilt trips, manipulation, and overall very depressing things, and then will call other family members and tell lies about what horrible things we said or did on those holidays. What should I do? "
"Married 26F with my 28 M, caught husband having sex with a close friend of ours. The've been having an affair. Thank you for the messages and advice!



Here is a link to the previous thread. https://redd.it/4wsqpw 
Hello everyone, I wanted to give everyone a quick update. I received lots of messages, and appreciate the advice. I wanted to clarify and update about the situation. He is not a serial cheater, when we were together, he never cheated, or mistreated me. This was his first GF/Love, and somewhere their relationship went south. 

Later I came into this picture. In the back of my mind, I had a fear that he still had feelings for her. And I knew I could never compete with her in looks and her bedroom behavior.

 However we had a few years of a great relationship. fast forward a few years, she gets divorced, we help her through it, we become best friends. 

She came over to our house to have her laptop reprogrammed, something was wrong, but my assumption is, she intended to fuck him that afternoon. 

And that is what happened. They have been continuing this for a few weeks, since I have made it clear that we are not reconciling.

 I have received a few texts from her wanting to talk, but that is not happening. Sadly, we were discussing a potential 3 way, but this happened, and I think maybe since that was discussed, she used it as an opportunity. 

He is just as guilty.. I will be filing for divorce, and won't work on reconciling. He is open to ending it with her, and working on our marriage, but since they have a history, there is no guarantee this won't happen again.

 Most of my friends have never been through this, so their advice was mixed. So, I will just move on.

I've never seen myself as a mother, I don't like children, children don't really like me either, I never played with dolls and I don't know how to be around children. I think the world as it is right now is a crappy place to bring in new people. I like animals better and they like me back, gimme a puppy or a kitty or a bunny anytime. I've never really had that motherly instinct surge everyone has told me I would have and I've always said that when it get it, IF I get it (edited), then I'll want kids. I haven't, I have no rush for it and I am (was, read below) perfectly happy like this. I thought he was too, he did certainly look like it.

I was 100% clear about all of the above with my husband 3 years ago when we decided to get married (5 years together) and he said he was fine with it. Apparently he is not, and last week he got drunk, had a meltdown and said that he's miserable, that I'm selfish and that he does want to have children. He even pulled the ""your body won't bear a pregnancy later"". He even said that if when we turn 10 years together and we still have no kids, he'd leave.

I don't think we need kids, also we both have very demanding professional lives. We compensate that with our favorite activities, we have even been blessed to find that balance between work and life.

I love him so so much, he's not perfect but really, who is? I don't want to lose him over this, should I get pregnant? Should I reevaluate this entire relationship? 

Please help.

EDIT: I am at work, sitting alone in my office having done NO work whatsoever all morning and I have tears in my eyes, sobbing uncontrollably. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account, but I've been in Reddit for years, I usually am the one trying to give advice to a complete stranger, not really knowing if he/she would read it, and if they would how would they react to it. Today, I am completely overwhelmed by you, my dear fellow redditors, you have not only read my little story but have been incredibly direct, honest and loving. Today, I don't feel as alone as I've felt all week, I've been terrified to talk to my Mom about it, I've been terrified to call my therapist and asking her for an appointment, I had absolutely no idea how to handle this situation. You have given me so much courage such great advice and so much love that I really had to write this down. For the first time since last week, these tears are of happiness and courage. I am excited that the world is not as shitty as it looks and that total strangers can lift someone up so high, they´ll find that courage in their hearts and minds. 

Please keep on writing, I read everything. Thank you so so so much for it all.

EDIT 2: So I called him and asked him about the counselling, surprisingly he said yes and apparently he's very willing. He's also saying that ""the whole kids thing comes and goes, it's not a deal-breaker for me"" WTF?!?!?!? I'm so confused and angry right now I want to throw my poor phone out the window.

About the whole meltdown and berating he seems truly sorry, I told him I want us to be happy but that we need help. I also told him I needed solo therapy as well, since this whole ordeal has really taken its toll on me and I need to get my shit together. If I'm not ok with myself, I won't be able to be ok with anyone else. He said that he was scared about that but that he was ok. I thought of suggesting him that he should also go to therapy, but I'm terrified of how he'll take it. He didn't suggest it either.

Thank you all, you have been incredibly helpful.

Woof. I will try to make this short but please forgive me if I ramble.

When I was in college, I had a rough patch with my sister, Gabrielle, and we were both very mean and vindictive to each other. It started with an inheritance that was rightfully hers, that my parents made her split with me. Long story short, she became resentful of having to share her money with me and kept track of every dollar I spent. She even reported to my parents anytime I went out drinking with friends, or doing anything I should not be doing, just so she could say, ""See, I told you we shouldn't have given her the money.""

I was 20 years old at the time and very resentful of having what felt like a PI intruding on my life and making my parents constantly yell at me, so I did the immature thing and kissed her boyfriend one Thanksgiving or Christmas (can't even remember).

Two years later, when my sister and my relationship was improved but not perfect, we got in a petty fight before her birthday party and I wound up flirting with her boyfriend as some kind of immature revenge. I remember the cringe faces my friends made at me for basically grinding with Gabrielle's boyfriend on the dance floor that night, and I'm still completely embarrassed of that memory even though it was five years ago.

Fast forward to now. My sister and I have a good relationship as we are both adults with confidence, stable careers, et cetera. It helps that we did not see each other as much because I moved across the country for several years. I've since moved back to the city close to our hometown, where my sister lives, and we have resumed weekly or bimonthly dinners with the family on Saturdays or Sundays.

Four dinners ago, my mom was remarking on the state of our relationship now and commenting on how silly it was that we used to get on so poorly. My sister joked that I was a ""shitty human being"" then and I'm not anymore. Her husband, Nick, reacted strongly to ""shitty human being"" so in defense of her word choice, my sister revealed the thing about me kissing her boyfriend once, and then grinding on another years later. I was a bit uncomfortable but we all laughed and went on with the rest of the night.

But since that dinner, I noticed Nick starting to flirt with me. I can't even explain some of the moments because they were wordless but I'll list the more blatant offenses below:

* That night we were watching TV and he said I looked like a certain actress on TV, who in that scene, happened to be wearing a very revealing outfit. I felt a little weird but figured I was the one being weird because he said it in front of my sister and she didn't flinch.

* Next time, he came to hang in my room while mom and sister cooked downstairs. He has done this once or twice before but this time, kept looking for pictures of my college days because he wanted to see what I looked like back when I was ""seducing Gabrielle's boyfriends.""

* He caught me going through my favorite fitness Instagrams (lots of booty shots I'll admit) and asked if I was watching porn. I said no and he exaggerated a disappointed expression and said, ""Let me know if you are.""

* He got too close to me in the kitchen and I said, ""You don't have to stand so close,"" to which he responded, ""Is it okay if I do?"" I said I preferred that he didn't and he made a narrowed eye face at me as if to convey being skeptical. I flat out said, ""Why are you being weird?"" He didn't give me a real answer.

I'm angry because he never really acted inappropriately around me before. We had a pretty good relationship and liked to talk about sports, movies, the like. I always felt he and my sister were a good match, and that he was a good husband. But now it seems he heard a story and saw it as his green light to start messing with me. I feel he sees me as someone who's word against him would be invalid because of my history, and I want very badly to prove him wrong and just tell my sister and even parents what is happening. 

But I don't feel that any of his offenses thus far sound big enough to report to someone about. At the same time, I don't want to keep going to dinner and just waiting to be harassed in some way or another, just so I can point it out.

I'm livid and I'm a little embarrassed and I don't know which way is best to approach the situation. I'm not comfortable telling anyone I know about this so I appreciate any insight or advice.

EDIT: A lot is being made of the will. When I say ""rightfully"" I mean legally. Grandmother wrote Gabrielle in because she was the older child but had always referred to it as ""our"" money. Many years back, Dad asked Mom to have Grandma legally change it and Mom went nuts on him, saying that was ugly and not how our family worked. Grandma did not know about my or Gabrielle's rough patch or any of my poor behavior, so the will was certainly not written with that in mind. This hurts to say now but she died thinking we were perfect young women.

"My [24F] co-workers [various, mostly male 20's] are making fun of my bf's[26M, together a year] missing eye, and I've gotten in more trouble for defending him than they have.


So, my boyfriend, Ryan, lost his left eye a couple years ago, before I knew him. These days he mostly wears either an eye patch or put a fully-white fake eye in the socket, so it isn't like it is a subtle injury. I honestly think he is the handsomest guy in the world, but I know he gets a bit self-conscious about it, though he wouldn't admit it.

Anyway, on this previous Friday night, I had forgotten something important I needed and Ryan swung by and dropped it off for me. He was wearing the eye patch.

After he left, one of my co-workers, who I'll call Andy, asked me if there was something wrong with his eye. I just explained to him that he had lost that eye a couple years previously and figured that was all I would ever need to do.

Well, a little while later I stepped into the break area in the back, and Andy was in there talking to a couple other workers. He was covering his eye with his hand in an obvious mockery of an eye patch and saying something along the lines of ""I thought pirates were attacking the store or something"". They all laugh, and I just rolled my eyes and told Andy to stop being a douche. Well then other co-workers start jumping on board, asking my stuff like ""So your bf really only has one eye?"" and ""How did he lose it?"" I was trying to be polite and just told them yes, he is missing an eye, and I didn't really feel cool talking about how it happened without him around. 

Instead of dropping it, they starting making some very stupid and personal comments. They kind of stopped talking to me and were joking amongst themselves about how he shouldn't be driving and using an empty socket to hide stuff or something. I was getting *livid*, and finally lost it when I heard someone say ""I wonder what sex is like with a guy who has no depth perception."" I flew off the handle and told them to fuck off and shut their mouths.


They kind of shut up for a while. Towards the end of my shift, I was told the manager wanted to talk to me. I figured he wanted to hear about my co-workers making fun of my bf. instead, he asked why I had been yelling and using foul language in the workplace. I tried to tell him about the things they had been talking about that lead me to lose my temper. He brushed that aside, saying ""I mean, he was wearing an eye patch, you can't expect no one to ever say anything."" He told me I was wrong for losing my temper and causing problems at work over minor stuff. I was getting angry all over again, and I told the manager I should probably leave before I start yelling again. Before I left, he told me to take Saturday night off to ""cool down"" before I come back in.

I really don't know how to handle this. I have a mind to call and complain to corporate, but I think it would also be pretty obvious to anyone here who complained, and Im not sure I have faith in the corporate office to protect me from retribution if it comes to it.

There is also a not-insignificant chance I will get pretty angry all over again if co-workers keep making comments about Ryan's injury.

"My [30M] girlfriend [29F] treats my cousin [23F] as ""other women"" because that's how it is in their culture.


My cousin and I run a nightclub. The club was started by our dads (brothers) and each of us started working here when we were 18. Since three years ago, my dad and uncle have both been retired and we run the place now.

My GF and I have been dating for a year. She's from a foreign country. Apparently in their culture, cousin relationships and marriages are very prevalent. That has made her more than a little uncomfortable with this situation. She thinks she can't shake it out of her mind that this is waiting for something to happen between us. To me this is incredibly absurd. She's not asking me to make a change but she has told me that she's uncomfortable 5 times now and she wraps it around things like ""you two are spending time until late nights"" but that's really just the nightclub business. Your working hours are late at night.

The last time she mentioned this I told her that I would have understood if this was a random girl who I was working closely with but it's not. But she thinks if it's not a sibling it should count as ""other women"". She says her own parents are cousins.

I don't know how to respond if (really when) she brings it up again.

"My [17F] Daughter is upset with me[41M] after coming out as gay to me.


So, Throwaway cause I know she uses reddit, as do I.

I'd like to preface this that her uncle - my brother - is gay, and I have never talked bad about it or that it bothers me, so this really has me confused.

So Last night I was in my living room reading a book when *Sally comes in looking rather sheepish. I clocked her with a smile and went back to reading my book. I knew the look on her face meant she wanted to say something, but I would let her get it out in her own time.

After a few minutes she kind of blurts out that she has something to tell me. I put my book down and she starts raving on about her feelings and how confused she's been for a few years. This was weird for me as I am not the most emotionally available person, and I kind of thought this was a conversation she should have with my wife, and her mother, but whatever I'll try and help her like a dad should. 

Maybe 10 minutes into what had become a bit of a ramble, she kind of wore her self out and just let out ""I'm gay dad."" I was a little side struck for a few seconds and (admittedly looking back it may have come off a little callous maybe) I said back to her ""Oh, okay. good for you."" I picked up my book and read again. It didn't matter to me whether she was gay, and I thought making a big deal about it might upset her, so the low key approach should have worked right?

Nope, been avoiding me ever since. even after I told her, that her sexuality is of no concern of mine as long as she is happy. Her mother is confused as to why she thought a 'need' to tell me about it. We're both pretty liberal people and I have a gay brother with whom I love, so why she is sad and noticeably upset with me I have no idea! Have I missed a trick here? Did she want me to make a fuss over it?

I wouldn't consider my self an unfair or strict dad, or given her reason why she thinks I need to approve of her sexual preferences. My only ruling on this is, be safe. We live in the UK so it's 16 for age of consent and When she turned 16 I told her that I know what I was like at that age and that not all boys are being nice just to be nice, and that as long as she is safe and responsible that's good. I was not gonna lie to myself and pretend she was not going to start having sex. Me and her mum agreed that it was better in the house than in an alley, wasn't exactly thrilled but my wife assured me she was a responsible young woman and would be safe.

I really have no idea what I have done wrong.

**tl;dr**: Daughter comes out as gay, I tell her ""okay"" it doesn't bother me, and now she's upset with me. Why?"

So I took the advice of some to CALL my friend rather than an impersonal email or facebook message and left a nice voicemail offering to take him and his wife to dinner and apologizing for missing their wedding. He called back and squeezed me in their packed schedule before they leave for their honeymoon.



I saw them last night for dinner! I gave them hugs and apologized again for missing their wedding. The groom said he vaguely remembered the bad breakup AND the restraining order but said he thought enough time had passed because the order of protection had expired. He also said they sent out the invites and save the dates in waves and the ex and I were in different waves.  He said he thought we could put aside our issues for one day for his special day. He said he had invited family members that didn't get along with one another with the expectations that everyone could put aside their issues for his wedding.  I told him I didn't want to see the ex ever again, especially being alone at the wedding, and wasn't comfortable at all attending. My friend acknowledged this, and then we had a good dinner and caught up since our college days.



They confirmed they had received my many gifts the day after their wedding.  THEN they said the Ex had RSVPed, and volunteered to be the sound guy (emcee and sound system) but DID NOT SHOW UP.  My friend had to man the sound system on his own wedding day. The groom and bride said they would have rather me show up than the Ex. 



We have plans for me to see their house when they return from their honeymoon and hang out more frequently (they have an incredible collection of board games). It was a great dinner.

**TL;DR I apologized to my friend and his wife for my absence on their wedding day, they have forgiven me, and we are still friends.**

"[Update] My boyfriend [28m] of three years is mad at me [25f] because I don't want to visit his dying grandma again.


[Original Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4x3iar/my_boyfriend_28m_of_three_years_is_mad_at_me_25f/)

tl;dr of my last post was: Dropped everything and drove 10 hours to visit my boyfriend's dying grandmother last weekend and he wants me to turn around and do it again this weekend, which I don't think I can handle.

My post didn't get too much attention but I did get quite a few people PMing me asking if I could update them on the other issues that came up in the thread (my boyfriend basically taking advantage of me and treating him like his personal nanny, maid, and sex toy while receiving little to nothing but a roof over my head in return). First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate all of the support I received and that everyone's comments really opened my eyes to a situation that I had become numb to.

On Friday I tried talking to him about it (a little premature I know, but it was eating at me). I admitted that I sort of felt that things were going downhill and in a moment of weakness I started looking at apartments for my girls and I to move into. His initial response was that I shouldn't ever complain that he doesn't think about the future for us when I'm out looking for apartments (this is an issue I brought to him a while ago - we've been dating for three years and have a child, but no serious talk about marriage, saying he's not going to 'rush into it'). Fair enough, but I explained to him that the reason that I did it was because I was brought to the realization that without him, my day to day life would not change. My emotional support level would minimally change, along with the amount of love and affection I feel.

Reddit, he said nothing. **Absolutely nothing.**

After about five minutes of staring blankly at each other, I went to bed without another word to him. We got up Saturday morning and I went to see his grandma with him, we acted like nothing happened and I honestly had a great time. I love his family, they love me. And that's where it's confusing. We obviously have some pretty severe issues, but now that I spent the whole weekend with his (entire/huge) amazing family, I feel so conflicted. When we got home I tried to bring it up to him but nothing came of it.

I'm sorry for such a dull update - I just wanted to let the people asking know what happened. I don't think we'll talk about it again. He'll act like nothing happened, just like he always does, and I don't want that. I'm pretty sure it's over. I'll be devastating his family and he'll probably hate me forever, but there's really not much more I can do when I voice my concerns and they're not even valuable enough to warrant a response.

So now I have to figure out how the hell I'm going to move out with no money and raise two kids on my own. I just want you all to know that I appreciate you bringing these issues to light and making me realize that I didn't have to be with someone who does nothing but take advantage of me.
