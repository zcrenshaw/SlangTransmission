"I've got a nice one, for once.


I work in a big box retail store. A few months ago, a man came in and wouldn't speak to me. Wouldn't answer any questions, wouldn't look me in the eyes - again, I work in an unusual part of town, and I just assumed he was being a jerk. I know he could hear me - he responded properly to swipe his card and followed through with the pin pad questions.

Again, I just brushed it off, no big thing. Twenty minutes later he came back in and bought a pack of gum, looked me in the eyes, and said, ""I'm sorry about my behavior earlier. I have panic attacks, and this was too much for me. I called my wife because I felt so terrible, and she told me to come back in and apologize."" I told him no biggie, I understand, I've had them my entire life.

But even sweeter - 2, 3 months go by. I see so many customers that I generally dont remember faces. This man and his teenage son come through my line yesterday and he says, ""You don't remember me, but I remember you. I had a panic attack and you understood. I try to come through your line every time you're here.""

Idk, sometimes there is a silver lining in retail."
"Yes Ma'am I know they are called ""Animal"" crackers but...


I'll keep it short and sweet...
This lady comes up to one of our registers to checkout and begins asking the cashier about one of our products:

Lady: These animal crackers are so adorable! Do you know if they are safe for all animals or just dogs and cats?

The Cashier just laughs a bit thinking she was joking... only to realize the lady has gone totally deadpan.

Lady: Well are they or not?! I don't want to get any of my animals sick!  

Cashier: N-no Ma'am they're not... They're for people...

Lady: *rolls her eyes* Then why would they call them ANIMAL crackers?!  

Cashier: Because... they're shaped like animals.

Lady: WELL THAT'S JUST MISLEADING! Your store needs to label things like this better! How else is anyone suppose to know what they're for?!

...

She did not buy the crackers."
"When our store lost power and people walked into the automatic doors


One day in the middle of summer when it was blue sky outside and no wind whatsoever, the power went out in our grocery store after something fell on the power line.

Cue the greatest day in retail of my life.

Obviously we had to close the store and tell people to leave and not let anyone in. And obviously the automatic doors were not working while there was no power.

So while every employee in the store was running around telling people that they had to leave, PEOPLE WERE STILL SHOPPING WHILE THE POWER WAS OUT. I don't mean just looking around being confused, literally strolling, taking things off shelves and putting them in their carts. We had to tell people multiple times to leave and they would look at us like we asked them to commit a crime.

When everyone had left, that's when the real fun began. 

People weren't expecting the power to be out on a beautiful summer day so they would keep walking RIGHT into the doors. Nevermind that we had a HUGE sign on the door telling people that the power was lost and we weren't open. Nope, just walk right into the doors, get pissed, stomp their feet and walk away.

I was pissing myself laughing so much. It was the greatest thing ever.

About an hour into this, someone went out to tell people that it was closed before they got to the doors and he came back and said that some lady had asked him if they could ""open the store just for her."" Um, no?? We have no power??

Not to mention we had a liquor store attached to our store, and the looks on people's faces when they couldn't get in to get booze. Priceless.

The only day of retail I wish I could experience again. "
