"AskReddit is looking for new mods! What do you think about joining the AskReddit team?


We are looking to add more mods! The sub has been very busy so we are looking for new mods who will look after the queue, respond to mod mail, and moderate [Serious] threads. **These aspects will be your main duties.**

---

**Account requirements:** 
We do have some limits on who can apply, and those are:

* Your account must be at least one year old.

* You need to have 2,500 combined karma.

* You didn't apply in the last mod draft.

These are firm requirements because the bot will check both of these and automatically reject applications that don't meet the requirements. Moderation experience isn't required although it is highly encouraged. 

We have a link below that will go to our application. Please keep responses concise but meaningful, as we have a lot of applications to look through but want to get a sense of who you are and what you would bring to the table.

You'll find a link to the application below. We know there are a lot of questions but please be sure to answer them in a concise way because applications with over 9,000 characters will be automatically rejected. This won't be a problem most people will run into so as long as your responses are ""normal"" length, you should be fine.

There are a lot of questions for two main reasons: we want to get a sense of who you are and what you would bring to the team, and because moderating here is intensive. If you're turned off by how much time is required for the application or if you don't have much time to put into the sub, please don't apply.

---

~~[Link to application.]()~~

---

Please feel free to ask us questions about this application, moderating here, or any other questions you have. You're also welcome to message mod mail with questions. 

Off topic comments in this comment section may be removed. 
___
#Edit: The application will close on Friday, July 8.

#Edit: Thank you to all who applied! We will now go off to our lair and discuss!"
