"AskReddit is looking for new moderators!


r/AskReddit is looking to add new moderators. As you can probably imagine, the subreddit has been very busy, and we need help to keep up with the demand. 


---

**Account Requirements**

In order to apply, your account must meet the following criteria:

* Must have at least 2,500 combined (post+comment) karma
* Must be at least 1 year old
* Must not be banned from r/AskReddit

These are firm requirements, and you will not be able to fill out the application unless you meet all of these requirements. 

---

The link to the application can be found here. Most of the responses are limited to 500 characters, so please keep your responses concise. 

The application is composed of two parts: a questionnaire and a rules quiz. We will factor both parts into our decision but please don’t stress about the quiz. We don’t expect you to have a perfect understanding of the rules right now but this gives us a sense of where you are with the rules. You are welcome to refer to [the rules](/r/AskReddit/wiki/index), or any other resources, while completing the quiz.

---

Please feel free to ask us questions about this application, moderating here, or any other questions you have. You're also welcome to message mod mail with questions.


Off topic comments in this comment section may be removed.

Edit: This application was designed to work for most modern desktop and mobile browsers. If you are using internet explorer, or some obscure browser, I can't guarantee that it'll work. 

Edit 2: This application does not work with Reddit is Fun, as the app improperly detects part of the application to be a reddit post. Feel free to submit it from your mobile browser, or a desktop device, though.

Edit 3: The application period is now over, thanks to all that applied! If you are selected, you will receive a private message within a few weeks. "
