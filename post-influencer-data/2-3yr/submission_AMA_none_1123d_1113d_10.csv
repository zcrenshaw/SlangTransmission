"I was kidnapped by psychopathic criminals and forced to live with them as their child for 17 days and managed to escape. Story in comments. AMA


When I was ten, I was kidnapped from a mall by psychopaths. I am not sure if you guys did this, but when I was little, any time I went with my mom or grandmother shopping, I thought it was so fun to play in the circular clothes racks. You know, the ones that made you feel like you were in Narnia when you got inside of it and no one knew where you were. Well, about two weeks after my tenth birthday, my mom took me to the local mall to spend some of my birthday money. After we did my shopping, my mom wanted to buy a few things from a department store that bored me, so I started playing in the clothes rack. This next part is kind of fuzzy because it happened so fast. On minutes I was in the clothes rack bent down, in my own world, and in the blink of an eye, someone had reached in, had one hand over my mouth, and the other over my eyes, and picked me up. Like I said, this happened very very quickly, and the area of the department store that we were in was just near the exit door, so just like that, I was snatched, we were out the door in less than fifteen seconds, and I was thrown in a vehicle that sped away. All I remember from the vehicle is that I got a glimpse of the driver, a white middle aged man, and the one who grabbed me, a white middle aged woman. by the time I had seen both of them, the woman had pinned me down, duct taped my hands and feet together, and duct taped my mouth. I was then forced to wear a black mask over my eyes, and then I felt what I assume was a blanket. (I guess the blanket was in case anyone saw us.) This was in the evening, sometime before supper. I specifically remember that because I was hungry. Me and my mom were supposed to go eat at my favorite Chinese place. From here, we drove for what felt like an eternity. I couldn't see anything, but I remember crying the whole time. I tried breaking free at first. I tried screaming, but it was like they couldn't hear me. I could hear them carrying on a normal conversation in the front seat like nothing had happened. All I could do was think about what might happen next, and if my mom noticed that I was missing yet. I was praying that the department store had cameras in it, or maybe that the mall police had seen what happened and would be saving me at any second, but that was not the case. We drove for what I can assume would be between 5-12 hours. I do not know for sure, but I know it was still dark when the vehicle finally came to a stop. I wanted to just stay in the vehicle. I was scared of what might be outside. All I could think of was the semi scary movies that my brother had allowed me to watch with him behind our parents back..... I couldn't stop thinking of the torture that might come. Well that didn't matter because suddenly I was being taken out of the vehicle.... but it was not done forcefully, but kind of gently. It was odd. I could barely stand because my feet were still duct taped together. Then they took the blindfold like mask off of my eyes. There we were, standing in front of what seemed to be a normal house. No neighbors were anywhere in sight though it seemed. The man bent down and cut my feet free, and by this point I was only restrained by my hands and had the tape over my mouth. So, I took off at a dead sprint. I didn't know where we were or where I was going, but I knew I wanted to get out of there. Not but four steps in, the woman tackled me. She still wasn't mad. I was so confused. She then drug me inside, and once we were in, she locked a deadbolt on the door from the inside. Then I looked around... I can still remember what the inside of the house looked like. It was PERFECT. I had never seen something so clean and organized. It looked like something out of the 50's. It was half way comforting, but also it made things that much more frightening. This is when I noticed the bars on all of the windows. We were locked inside the house. I started crying again. This is when I got really scared. The woman came back into the living room ( I don't exactly remember when she left) and this time she had a gun. This is when she proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't be upset, because she has prepared a beautiful home for me, and as long as I followed the rules, everything would be okay. That's when she tapped the gun on the table next to her as if to say she would shoot me if I didn't follow the rules. She then told me the rules of the scary life that I was going to have to live..... I had to call them mom and dad. I was to never complain about anything. I had a list of chores......everything that you would expect a normal life to be like in the 50's, except I was locked in and held at gunpoint. I lived this scary life, ( they also gave me a new name; Madeline).... anyway, I lived this life for exactly 17 days. To be honest, I don't remember the days. It was scary, and I learned that these people couldn't have kids of their own, couldn't adopt, so they resorted to kidnapping. Everything blurred together. We had 3 meals a day, a certain amount of time for TV, and lights out every night ( I was locked in my bedroom at 8 pm) at 8:30. The next thing I remember, was that one day, while the man was at work (who I was forced to call dad) the mom went on the front porch to water the flowers. She always locked the door behind her, but this time, I noticed that the lock hadn't secured all the way. I knew that I still didn't know where I was, nor did I know exactly what I would do, but I knew I had to leave. So while she was watering the plants, I slipped out of the door. Im not sure how to explain this, but she was basically facing one way while I slipped off the porch on the other side. So she still didn't know that I was out. She then went inside, and I thought for sure she would notice I was gone, but she locked the door behind her. That was it. I had never run so fast in my entire life. I had no idea where I was going, but I just ran, and ran, and ran for what seemed like 10 miles ( turn out it was like 0.5 mile) and I saw a gas station. When I got in, I immediately lost it. I cried and cried and just kept saying call the police, call the police..... Finally the man working the counter called 911, and within minutes the police had arrived. I told them what had happened and my parents had been frantically searching for me, and it turns out the man and woman who took me had scary reasons as to why they couldn't adopt me. As it is almost 5, I need to leave work. If you want to know more about this I would be happy to share. Sorry it is so long. I can give specific accounts about things that happened during my time there, what my parents went through, and the back story of the kidnappers"

"I am a pedophile who has been arrested.


Hi all, Basically I would like to do an ama regarding my mental illness. I am a pedophile... 

That being said I have never harmed a child. 

The reason that I would like to do this is to present a view of this condition from the position of someone suffering from it and not from what people are in news headlines. 

It is Hell and there is no support and no one to reach out to. 

Im certain that many users on this site suffer similarly and others who have suffered at the hands of people with this condition and I would like the opportunity for people to discuss this with a sufferer.
