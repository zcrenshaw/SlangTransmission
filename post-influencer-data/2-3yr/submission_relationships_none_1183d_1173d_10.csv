"UPDATE: My(25) BF(28) won't ask for my hand in marriage so my Dad(51) is staging a family boycott of my wedding. Is my BF being disconsiderate?


original post is here,
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26pydf/my_bf_m25_wont_ask_for_my_hand_and_my_dad_m48_is/

The wedding went on as planned.  My parents stuck to their guns and boycotted.  One of my two sisters attended and is now happily blacklisted from our family.  Nobody else from my entire family showed up including my two brothers.

The wedding was a little unconventional.  My sister walked my husband down the aisle and then his sister walked me down the aisle.  I wanted this because my SIL actually introduced us and helped me get my first date with him.  There was no questioned about who gives away the bride or even about objections.  It was normal other than that.  There has been no contact between me and my family, other than my one sister.  My mother has made it a point to send me a card every time that they have a family gathering for holidays or birthdays at their house to let me know that my father says I'm not invited.  I get one almost every month.  I don't even read them anymore I just toss them.  I don't why they keep sending them because I've made no effort to contact them and I live over three hours away so it's not like I will run into them by accident.

The reason I came back to post this here is because some people here made a prediction that came true (that they would come crawling back when we had children).  I am now expecting our first child, a girl :).  She will be the first grandchild for my parents.  My parents found out about the pregnancy a few months ago through a family friend.   They didn't waste anytime in making demands, not requests, demands.  My boyfriend and I are not religious but I had a Catholic upbringing.  I don't practice at all by choice.  My mother called me back in April telling me that my father wanted our daughter's middle name to be his mother's first name.  I said no.  My father was listening in on speaker so I went ahead and told them that they were officially uninvited from all birthdays, graduations, and any other important dates in her life.  My father called me half an hour later crying and begging me to come stay with them for the birth so my mother could care for me.  I said no.

He also said that he had already made arrangements for his priest could baptize her at his church but that I needed to agree to naming her after his mother if I wanted this to happen.  He said he'd already planned a big celebration for the birth and the baptism that he was paying for.  I said no to all of it.  He went from meekly trying to sweet talk me to raising his voice at me and I hung up.

He called a couple of more times to apologize for losing his temper and again beg me to reconsider giving birth at a hospital near them so they could visit us.  He denied having any knowledge of my mother sending me cards to uninvite us to any family functions and even said that he specifically asked her to invite us but he was told I declined every time.   He lets my mom do the dirty work so he can later hide behind her and deny he had any knowledge.  He's done this since I was a little girl.  He does this every time he wants to drop the hammer on somebody but be the good cop also. He'll never change.  He denied having any knowledge of why anybody in the family missed my wedding.   I told him our daughter would not be baptized, or catholic at all (no offense to Catholics).  I told him he was too manipulative and controlling and I didn't want my daughter exposed to that.  He's too toxic and just venomous.

Coincidentally, the day and for several days after that phone call I got tons of calls and emails from my brothers, their wives, my sister, and all my aunts.  They all wanted to apologize for missing my wedding, and all had specific excuses, and wanted to make plans to be there for my daughter's birth.  I banned them all from her life until she's old enough to decide for herself to let them in.

My husband was a little surprised and not sure about banning everybody forever.  He's more leaning towards supervised visits if they want to drive to us.  My dad has been calling him like crazy but we are a united front.  My husband is deferring to me but giving me ideas as to how I can give a little if I decide to.  But with my family there's no giving a little.  They want it all.  For now, they're all banned.  I will reconsider when the youngest of our children turns 18 :).  For now my dad will have to settle for sucking up to my husband while I stick to my guns.  Unlike him, I don't mind owning my decisions even if it means I'm bad cop.  I'm not ready to give up a relatively drama free, stress free life to allow my dad and all his sheep back into our lives. 

   
**tl;dr**: Nobody in my family showed up to our wedding other than one of my sisters.  Everyone is banned from our lives."
"I [22M] just learned that my sister [29F] had an abortion to be able to donate me part of her liver. It caused her divorce. I can't stop hating myself.


What really happened: I was very sick four years ago and was in need of a liver transplant. My situation was that it was very unlikely that I would get one in time. At that time my sister was pregnant. I didn't know as it was early (less than two months). My situation was getting worse and my sister decided to do an abortion and then two months later we did the transplant surgery.

I never knew about the pregnancy. All I knew was that she gave me half of her liver. My sister and her husband divorced a year later. I didn't know the truth until yesterday when my mom slipped up about an abortion that my sister had. I asked her about it and she told me everything. She told me that my sister made her promise not to tell me and she failed that promise.

My sister was very happy. My brother in law was a very decent guy. I knew they were looking forward to having children. They were great together. She always told us about how lucky she is to have found him.

Apparently at the time of their decision, my sister and her husband had great disagreement. He didn't want her to have the abortion and risk the transplant surgery and was hopeful that my situation might sort itself out without my sister's help. The chance was very small but it was there. My sister didn't agree. They couldn't convince one another and my sister did things anyway without his blessing. They tried working things out after the surgery, they went to counseling, they even tried to have another baby but they couldn't get themselves to do it. He couldn't forgive my sister and she wasn't all that apologetic so they ended up separating and eventually divorcing.

My sister isn't happy now. Hasn't been since the surgery. She never told me the real reason for her divorce. She told me that they were after different things. I just learned things from my mom. I asked my mom if my sister still thinks that she did the right thing. She said ""she's not sure"".

I can't stop feeling guilty. My sister saved my life but destroyed her own life doing it. She had to abort the baby she definitely loved and looked forward to and did that knowing that it will probably end her marriage as well. I was ready to go at that time. I had accepted my fate and I was at peace. She should have just let me. Shit. My brother in law should have told me so I would have talked her out of it. I'm surprised he didn't. I can't feel anything but to hate myself.

I don't know what to do. Should I talk to my sister? What should I tell her? Should I keep my mouth shut and pretend that I don't know? I'm not sure if I'll even be able to look into her eyes and not show that I know. I just don't know what the fuck I should do.

Please please help me.

**tl;dr**: My sister did an abortion be able to give me part of her liver and saved my life, but it costed her marriage. "
"[Update] My best friend [22F] of 16 years who has never shown interest in me surprises me [22M] at my graduate school apartment and seduces me into a friends with benefits relationship.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dh3b3/my_best_friend_22f_of_16_years_who_has_never/


The previous from my first post **TL;DR:** my best friend of 16 years who has never shown interest in me shows up at my college apartment one day and randomly has sex with me. She's been coming over pretty much every other day since the semester started. I've liked her for years but she won't give a definitive reason as to what this means or where it's going and it's scares me.

Despite most people including many of my closest friends telling me to just end things with her or force her into a decision, I decided to just ride it out accepting that I'd probably get tossed to the side when someone better came around for her. 

We went on to be FWB for about 4 months and those were honestly the most nerve-racking months of my life never knowing when or if it was going to end or what she was really thinking. I tried my best to play it off as if it didn't bother me but really it was a bitter-sweet time for me.

After our school semester ended we drifted a part a little bit, we both were spending time with family and friends. We both had extremely busy semesters and spent most of the time studying or with one another so it was expected. 

She ended up going on vacation with her parents to visit her grandparents in England. She did invite me to come along months ago but I already had other obligations so I couldn't go with her despite wanting to.


We did talk on the phone a few times while she was away, I actually had annual soccer tournament with my traveling team and we met this all girl's team at the tournament that I was telling her about it since she plays soccer as well. 

She seemed happy for me that I was having fun but I could tell that it was bothering her I just chalked it up to maybe I sounded like I was bragging or something.

Two weeks later she asks me if I can pick her up from the airport because she flew back early and she nearly knocks me over she hugs me so tightly. She never shown so much intimacy in public before she even tells me that she really missed me. 

It's like 8pm and we go to Starbucks she's being like really different, a lot quieter than normal and she seems a little nervous around me like she wants to say something.

Eventually she confesses that she realizes that she does like me as more than just a friend and she apologizes for her unfairness making me wait so long before giving me an answer. 

She tells me that before she left she didn't really know what she wanted, she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or if she was ready to be in one. She said that she was afraid to get into a relationship with me only to realize that she didn't want it and feared that our friendship would be never bounce back.

She told me that she experienced a lot of things in England and was sad that she wasn't able to experience them together. She talked to her older sister who lives in England who really put in some good words for me. 

So we're officially dating and everything has been awesome, couldn't be happier. Sorry if this update is bit lacking, I tried to summarize three weeks worth into this post without making it a novel. But if you have any questions about anything just let me know.

Thanks for the advice on the original post really gave me some solid perspective.

**TL;DR:** We're finally dating and everything is great. I guess it pays to be patient sometimes. We'll be celebrating our first month on the 1st of July.

"[Update] Me [14 F] with my brother [20 M], is making me give him money and says he'll kill my pet if I tell our parents

"UPDATE: I (23 F) allowed my boyfriend (27 M) to have sex with other girls and I want him to stop.


Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4p11ym/i_23_f_allowed_my_boyfriend_27_m_to_have_sex_with/

So the day following the post I decided to have sex with him to avoid him running out to other girls while I decided if I wanted to continue the relationship or not. After some thinking and re-reading of the comments on my post (again, thanks so much to everyone who helped out) I decided to try and give him a firm talking to and if he still doesn't comply with my boundaries then we are over. I gave him a talk and said he was not to see any other girls besides me or fuck anyone else and that I was the only female he is to be intimate with. He agreed and took it alot better than I thought he would. We fucked later that night. I thought our relationship was okay again.

I was wrong.

The next day I turned my bf down when he wanted to fuck. The conversation went something along the lines of this:

Bf: wait baby you don't want to tonight?

Me: No babe sorry I don't feel like it &amp; I'm tired as fuck.

Bf: Are you sure babe?

Me: Yeah goodnight

BF: wait babe what am I supposed to do now? You said I can't fuck any other girls so you're supposed to keep me taken care of. Its gonna start affecting me again.

Me: You know what I am incredibly stupid I'm sorry babe. Go sleep with as many girls as you want I don't want you depressed.

BF: serious? you're the best britt

Me: (in shock that he had the audacity to say that) yeah I'm serious! But this relationship is over.

From that point I just got up, walked out and spent the night at one of my friends house. Now I just have to pick up my stuff when he's working and probably stay with my parents until I see where life takes me. It's tough after 4 years but I have no regrets. I'm happy and life is good.

Tldr; we broke up :)"
"[Update] My (31F) husband's (32M) mother (60sF) has Alzheimers. He moved her in with us and is not actively looking for a nursing home. My house is a mess and I am at my wits end


Link to the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4knk8d/my_31f_husbands_32m_mother_60sf_has_alzheimers_he/)'

Hi everyone, I wanted to post an update since so many people requested one in the first post. I know it's been quite some time, but a lot has happened and it finally calmed down enough that I could find the time to post.

Good news, husband's mom is now in an appropriate home. We were able to find a place about an hour drive from where we live that was $7k a month and that had pretty great reviews. We obviously toured it first and talked to the staff and asked extensively about activities, cleaning schedules, food, etc. Mother-in-law was moved in this week. We were really lucky, because of our location there wasn't a long waiting list and there were several openings this month alone. It also helped we had a strong referral from her long time physician (the one who actually told us about this place to begin with).

So basically what happened after that post-

I called Mike and told him we needed to talk when he got home. When he got in we sat in my study and I laid it out for him. I told him exactly how I felt about the situation, told him it was enough. I showed him some printouts of information I had on Alzheimer units surrounding us, even articles on coping with having a parent going through this. 

Long story short- we got into an argument. He accused me of being unsupportive, being selfish, etc. I refused to take it. I have been the one to stay home and babysit his increasingly sick mother all day, not him. I told him that and that if he was so dedicated to having her stay in the house, *he* could be the one to take care of her. I was at the absolute limit. 

I packed a bag and checked myself into one of the nicer hotels. I went out and bought some bath bombs and wine and for the first time in a long time I just had time for me. I was able to sit on my laptop and actually get ahead on my work. He was of course texting me and calling but it was just to continue his tirade, which I could happily ignore for the time being. I knew that he would soon be seeing things in a much different light.

It seriously took only two days. He begged me to come home. He told me he was sorry and that he didn't know just how bad it was. I told him he'd have to do better than that and to actually take her to the doctors and get that referral so we could have her moved to long-term care ASAP. Make an appointment at a home. Start prepping her for the move. Until then, I wasn't checking out of my newly found peace and quiet.

He actually came through. Her physician, a really really great guy btw who also had a parent go through this, got us fast tracked for this place. I think that paired with Mike seeing his moms actions really helped to open his eyes to the reality of the situation. She wasn't just ""a little off"". She was actually a danger to herself. 

I also talked to my husband about getting therapy. I told him it would be normal to have feelings of guilt or sadness over this and that I thought he should take the time to see someone. I offered to go with him if he wanted me to be there. He said he would think about it and I decided not to push it. I will take it up with him again though if I see he's not doing well because of it.

He cried a lot the day we had to take her in. When we got home we had a long talk about how he felt and he told me he was sorry he said I was selfish or uncaring. He said he realized how much I must have cared to do that for him for 3 months. I told him it doesn't mean someone doesn't care when they have to just admit they can't handle something. There are professionals for a reason, we're just not them. 

So that's where we're at right now. This week is more about everything settling down, him getting used to his mom being away, me getting the house back to normal and getting back into routine. I've left her belongings in the room she was occupying so he could still have that piece of her and we could bring things to her as necessary. They gave us a list of clothing items needed, but it was mostly comfortable housewear like pjs and slippers and since it's not winter yet nothing bulky like sweaters or coats. I had to have the mattress replaced in her room though because she had wet the bed often and not said anything so it was destroyed. I cleaned up her bathroom and just tidied the room up in general so it was livable again. 

I want to say thanks to everyone who weighed in. So much good advice and words I much needed to hear in that original thread. Thank you to everyone who shared their personal story and gave their suggestions on how to help husband cope. Hopefully from here on out things can be a lot more stable. It's definitely not easy and I wish that in a perfect world none of this would have to be happening, but it already feels so much better this way. 




   
**tl;dr**: My husband finally saw the light and we moved his mom to an appropriate Alzheimer unit where she will get the assistance she needs. Husband and I reconciled, I am making sure to be very supportive of him during this hard time. I put the option of therapy out there for him, but will let him decide on his own. Thank you all so much for your help. "

"[UPDATE] My [32F] Girl Scout Leader [32F] stole all of the cookie money.


It has been just about a month and I have an update for all of you. Thank you so much to everyone who offered advice and their stories. It really helped!  [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4l093t/my_32f_girl_scout_leader_32f_stole_all_of_the/)

Most of you urged me to go to the police and file a report. Well I did, but the officer that talked with me said I shouldn't file a police report yet and should contact Candie and try to procure the money from her to show that when I do file a police report I can show them that I made every attempt to get it from her and that she is aware of the theft. So, I messaged her:

""Candie, in the month of March our Girl Scouts' bank account was drained. I went to the bank and have account statements and withdrawal slips showing that you made unauthorized withdrawals from the account. If you do not restore the account I will be filing a police report on June 1st to protect myself and the girls""

Her response:

""I will be restoring it no worries. It was not all me but I will be replacing it because I am the one who lost the information. But thank you. I am putting in a certain amount each month towards both girl scouts and the bank. But thank you, I got what you are saying.""

My response:

""I spoke with the branch manager at the bank. They have evidence that it was you. I have had a bank account there for over a decade, they require you to show proper ID when you withdraw money from the account. Also, there are cameras outside and inside the building.""

Candie's response:

""Well without going into my personal information, I do not remember it, but I am being treated for it. Acknowledged my mistake and will take care of it. It will all be paid to the GS council before August 1st and the remainder of the money is accounted for between my trip to the council shop and the stuff I will be purchasing for the water park. My first payment to them is June first  because that is my first check for my new job. That is all I'm saying on any of this.""

After that, I talked with the GS council again and sent them the messages. I told them that if they didn't resolve this I would. They had a meeting about it the next day and decided to remove Candie as a volunteer (obviously) and that they would be going after her for the full amount of what they owe the Girl Scouts and what she stole from our troop. They also agreed to deposit the money right back into our account as soon as she was removed from the bank account. I was super happy about this resolution! There is a catch though... they didn't want me to tell the parents at our last meeting that this was going on. They had to officially send Candie a letter of removal before it was official. Also my contact at the GS council said they still wanted me to pass out flyers for Candie's water park event that she promised. I was pissed about that, because this lady might have a drug problem or something, how in hell can you trust that she will go buy anything for the water park or even show up? AND if she does what if she uses it as an opportunity to scam them out of more money? They had Candie drop off the troop meeting information on my porch so I didn't have to talk to her.

Well, I went to the meeting and no one ended turning up because Candie had conveniently scheduled it the day before they had the day off of school, which I wasn't aware of since I don't have a child in the school. So no one thought there was a meeting. I was actually really happy about that, because I didn't want to encourage them to go to this supposed water park event hosted by criminal Candie. 

After that, the Girl Scout Council agreed to send a representative to have a meeting with the parents and go over our options for next year and having a new troop leader. Candie sent me a message this morning (I guess one of the parents clued her in about our meeting):

""The only thing that needs to be discussed at tonight's meeting, is the fact that I will not be returning as troop leader for Troop 
xxxxxx, my family is moving and will no longer be in the school district or nearby to be able to continue with the truth. I wish you the best of luck.""


Yes, screw her for trying to cover her own ass. Even though I would love to tell everyone how terrible she is, I decided not to tell the parents about Candie. I thought about it a lot, and if I did, one of the parents will tell their daughter and then everyone will be gossiping about Candie's daughter. It is not this poor girl's fault that her step mom is a crook and I don't want her to get bullied because of it. I also think it would turn a lot of the parents away from the troop and I don't want to ruin everyone's girl scout experience because of me. Candie is gone and can't be a part of the troop anymore, so good riddance. Girl Scouts are going after her for all of the money so she will have to face the legal consequences as well. Me telling the parents wouldn't help anything.

Also, on a positive note, at the meeting one of the parents said they will step up and be troop leader, yay! I have decided to stay on and help them as much as possible. I want to have a good experience volunteering and I shouldn't give up because of one jerk. 


**edit** Just wanted to add to those that are worried that Candie can do this to another troop, she has been black listed from the Girl Scouts organization nationally, she is not allowed to be in any leadership role. As far as her doing something shady somewhere else otherwise... there's not a whole lot I can do about that. I can't let everyone in my state know she is a scumbag, so it is what it is. 
   
tl;dr: Candie was kicked out of the troop and the Girl Scouts are legally pursuing her for the money stolen from both the Girl Scouts and the troop. We're moving on! "

Putting this up top because the post might get lengthy: 
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend continually insulted my lady parts. I tried to talk to him, but he just made excuses and blamed his behavior on me, so I broke up with him.

This morning I decided to sit my boyfriend down and explain how hurtful his comments had been. He became very defensive and stated that the labia comment was meant as a compliment. Furthermore, he expressed that he thinks I'm far too sensitive, lack self confidence, and that nobody else would be bothered by his ""negging"". From the responses friends have given me when I've mentioned this (and from the comments on my previous post), I really don't think that's true. Constantly picking apart your significant other's appearance is the abnormal behavior. 

His reaction really drove home for me how selfish and insensitive the dude is. I could name numerous situations during the course of the relationship where he played the martyr, disregarding my needs and feelings entirely. 

Cases in point (All entirely true- sadly):
* He managed to break a sex toy (that he had purchased and that I hadn't even wanted to use) so forcefully that it cut me ""down there"". I got to go to urgent care bleeding from the vajayjay and he texted me saying how much it ""sucked that he hadn't gotten off"". 

*He demanded to use my laptop to play video games while on vacation, caught the charger cord with his foot while he flailed around playing World of Warcraft, and smashed it to the ground. He had a fit when I asked him to pay for the repairs and went home 10 days early (without me).

*He wore threadbare gym shorts to my grandfather's funeral and watched porn on his phone during the service.

Point being, the guy's a selfish, disrespectful jerk. I put up with it for far too long and I'm just done. Nobody's significant other should make them feel as crummy as he did me. I hope that he is able to change his behavior and find happiness in a relationship in the future. As for me, I will take my ""lady garden"" somewhere that it will be appreciated in future. Thanks to all who commented. Your kind advice helped me see what I needed to do.

"UPDATE: Me [45F] with my daughters [17F &amp; 16F]. I like one more than the other and I'm having trouble not showing favouritsm.


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4msixe/me_45f_with_my_daughters17f_16f_i_like_one_more/

So I know it's only been about 3 weeks since the last post. Already a lot has happened, and there's probably a lot more work to do but I just want to thank everyone for their advice and let you know that progress has been made! (LONG)

It was clear from all the comments that there were a few issues I had to deal with. 1 was to actually involve myself more in Izzy's life and interests, and 2 was to stop letting her get away with hurting Sam so much and teach her that she can't talk down at people like she is. 3 is to ride it out as much as I can and hope that she mellows out over time like a lot of commenters said they did as they aged. 

So the first thing I did was make a list of all the films/tv shows recommended by people here to look in to, to try and find some things I can watch with Izzy to make her feel included. It was a LONG list and I think we got some really good options that will appeal to the whole family! The first thing I tried out is Steven Universe as just about everyone on here suggested it for me. Izzy actually walked in on me watching it about 5 episodes in (so much for 1 taster episode to see if it was any good)  and sort of paused in the doorway and asked ""You.. actually like steven universe?"" I said one of my coworkers had recommended it as a cute show to watch and I actually kinda love it. Oh I wish I could have taken a picture of the smile on her face. She immediately jumped onto the sofa and started quizzing me on how far along I am, who my favorites are, if I liked this show then I'll love X and started listing off other shows (a lot of which were on my list to try out). 

I told her we could try all them out, I actually already have a few, and reinstate film night - BUT under a new condition to make sure we don't run into any issues again. I purchased some dry-wipe boards and pens and proposed the following idea: During all films and tv shows, there is to be silence as I would like to watch something without it being talked over. However we write down questions/topics we want to talk about on the boards throughout the film. At the end of it, we designate a ""discussion time"" to talk all about it. Izzy agreed to it and said that was probably fair, so that was one win! We've had two film nights since then. The first one we watched was legally blonde and she was constantly scribbling on the board. The discussion after went pretty well I feel, Izzy did most of the talking about how empowering Elle Woods is but I tried to engage her so she didn't feel like I was just glazed over and ignoring it. Sam has at this point finished her exams and took up her volunteer work pretty much full-time so it was just me and Izzy doing this, which I thought gave some nice quality time. 

I tried to find some activities for us to do together that aren't hair/nails and thought she might enjoy a hike as we live pretty close to a national park here, so I suggested that one day. I was turned down but that's fine, i'm not expecting an immediate turnover. I'll just keep suggesting things every few days to let her know I do want to do things with her. We've been watching orange is the new black since that came out, along with Steven universe and sense 8 now, so I still feel like we're making progress. 

Since Sam took up the extra work she's not really in the house much anymore so her and Izzy have clashed a lot less naturally, I still took down some of the comments you guys suggested (Like how by shaming Sam for what she's wearing, Iz is doing the opposite of feminism), but Sam actually beat me to it? So far only 1 has been made when Sam wore a small playsuit out one day as it's been getting pretty warm here. Izzy said something like ""Wow, I didn't think it was possible to wear any less clothing than you normally do. Who's this for then?"" but before I could even say anything Sam went ""Me, because I look damn good in it. Maybe you should try one, it's pretty empowering looking this good"" and skipped out the door. I was stood in shock for a second as Sam has never returned fire before, and Iz kinda did the same for a second before storming off upstairs. She hasn't made another comment since then (this was shortly after my first post) and I'm not sure if it's because they just don't see each other often or Iz was genuinely shut up by one comment from Sam? So I'm in limbo waiting for that one to come around.

While taking Sam out for uni supplies one day I asked her how she feels about Izzy's behaviour, because I really don't want her to be negatively impacted by all this. She said that she gets a little upset when Iz makes the comments, but she knows that she thinks she's coming from a good place and doesn't take it to heart. She also said that Iz would probably chill out after a few years and when she goes off to uni she'll be away from it anyway, so she's ""riding out the storm"" until September.

Me and Sam aside, the new debate group I mentioned in the comments Iz just joined has now become a big thing for her which I also think has been mellowing her out a bit. She's been going to sessions quite regularly, I asked her if they had audiences and if I could come along some time and she said ""Maybe in the future, it's new right now so it's really just class debating"". She's also become really close really fast with another girl in the group (we'll call her Anna), apparently they take the same subjects but are in opposite classes so they never met before this debate group. Either Anna is at our house or Izzy is at hers every day for the last two weeks so I'm glad she's made a close friend she can talk to - she's barely been on her laptop since so there's also less of the internet/tumblr fueling her behaviour. Since Anna came along Izzy has been significantly less argumentative and rude, she's been skipping around the house in an almost dream-like state and it's making my heart melt to see her this happy. I suspect Anna might be slightly more than just a new ""friend"" but I'm not going to push anything, Izzy can talk to me whenever she wants to. 

As for her dad, his project at work is wrapping up so there's now less late nights and they're back to the political chit-chat over breakfast and seem as close as ever.

So overall, I think things are improving. I'd like to thank everyone that took the time to comment, I read through every single one. I will continue bringing up activities and shows that you've suggested over time, I have a list saved of them all on my computer to keep asking her about. Eventually maybe Izzy will let me take her on a hike or go to see a play together, I just have to keep trying. I'll also punish her where appropriate if she calls out me or Sam for what we wear or our hobbies, because it's not okay to be rude. It's a weird line to walk right now of curbing rude comments while also suddenly making more of an effort to take part in her interests but I think I'm giving it a good go. 

TLDR: I'm starting to find common ground with Izzy, she's made a close friend(?) that is mellowing her out, the debate team has taken off and Sam is standing up for herself. It's going well so far!"
"Update: I [26F] missed an important funeral and now I think my 5 year relationship with my partner [28M] might be over.


Link to my [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4mi0e8/i_26f_missed_an_important_funeral_and_now_i_think/)

Original TLDR: my boyfriend can’t forgive me for missing his grandmother’s funeral, but it was scheduled only 4 days before I had to hand in my huge research project for my masters degree. He has been distant and treating me coldly and for the past 2 months and now wants me to go back to my home country and leave him to grieve alone for a few weeks. He says he needs some space and is considering moving out of our home; but overall wants us to still be together. Advice? Help?


I just wanted to first say thank you very much for all of your advice, it was really helpful, it made me feel like less of a terrible person and made me realise that my boyfriend is still mourning the loss of his grandmother. My SO and I had a long discussion the night I posted for advice on Reddit; and we agreed that we wanted to be together but that something needed to change in our relationship. We set some basic ground rules; we both agreed to start seeing separate therapists, him for his grief and troubles with his Dad and me for my lack of confidence and stress management. He again asked for space, so he moved out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom in our flat. I also booked a flight home for a few weeks to visit my own family, and I am set to leave in 4 days. 

We were making some good progress this week, enjoying time with each other, going to the park, just generally trying to reconnect. After sleeping in the spare bed for 5 days, he decided to move back into our room, and I was very happy about that. Up until 2 days ago I genuinely thought that we were going to make it through this. 


Things came to a head last night; I received my grades back from the school. I am very proud to say that I got an A on my research project, and one of my urban design proposals has also been nominated by my school for a Gold award from the RIBA. I am incredibly proud, this year was definitely the most difficult in my entire life and I did not expect to do as well as I actually did, I literally just wept when I get my results. 


I sent my SO a long message, letting him know how I did, and about the nomination, but more importantly thanking him for being there to support me through my degree. I told him I loved him, and that I was glad we were working together on our relationship. 


He came home that night fuming; he was so angry. He just yelled at me for basically an hour, about my lack of confidence in my own work, and about how I didn’t need to miss his grandmother’s funeral. He told me he hated me, and after that I sort of just numbed out. I don’t really remember much of what he said after that, I just stopped talking and listening. 


My final, end of year show is happening this week. It’s a huge celebration of the student’s work; I’ve filled an entire wall to exhibit my architectural work and my research results. During the end of year show a lot of people find jobs, so it’s important for us to be there to network and talk about our projects with people in the industry; I did this for my boyfriend last year when he exhibited his own work, I spent 6 hours at that event talking to different people about how amazing his work was. This morning he told me not to expect him to come tonight, because he needs to go to the gym. 


I’m flying home in 4 days, and I can tell that he just wants me to leave and never come back, which is what I am doing. I have stuck with all my promises that I made to him, I’ve supported him as best I could and I’ve begun seeing a therapist. He hasn’t even called his GP to get a referral to a therapist yet. He doesn’t want to fix our relationship; he just wants to keep me around to pay half of our rent and to use as a punching bag. 


So we’re over, I just paid my final half of the rent, and I’m moving back to my home country. I was originally only planning on returning for a few weeks, but with this ‘Brexit’ vote looking so grim I don’t really see the point in being in the UK anymore. Why return and find a job here when I will most likely be asked to leave in a year? I Like the UK, and I love my boyfriend, but it seems neither wants me so I’m going home to take care of myself. 


TLDR; Tried to use Reddit’s advice to fix my relationship, worked for just over a week.  I got my grades back and I did extremely well, my SO threw that back in my face, and is now refusing to come to my final exhibition of my work.  So we’re over, I’m moving back home, I have no plans to ever return to the UK.

"Me [20M] with my friend [21F] since high school (7 years), I got a weird feeling from her texts so I called the cops. Now her mother is upset at me for what I've done and how it makes her[mother] look.


 edit: I've been messaged that I should take this down in case I need to present any more information to the police? I don't know if that's relevant? 

TL;DR; Friend's mother is making friend's hospitalization about herself and how it makes her feel. I kind of want to giver her a piece of my mind.

Unfortunately I was texting my friend yesterday when she talked about putting a knife through herself and I got worried since she has a history of self harm so I called my sheriff buddy and they took care of it. They asked for my texts, so I sent them a screenshot, and with the way she was acting and what she said they took her to the hospital. That was two days ago. 

I'm good friends with her ex, and he made the mistake (and since apologized) of giving her mother my phone number. Friend used to complain about her parents and their lack of compassion and love, and also about their abusiveness. So I knew this was probably going to be rough hearing from them. She asked me what the ""hell I was thinking"" and ""do you have any idea what you've put [me] though."" ""How does this make me look."" I'm not sorry for what I did, and it's clear the doctors felt it prudent to keep her there for the past two days. She's still not out yet. I'm glad she's getting the help she needs and deserves, rather than the ignorance and toughen up attitude her parents give her.

I feel like texting her and giving her a piece of my mind, but for now I've just ignored it. Shouldn't a parent's first priority is to keep their child safe?"
"My mother [50F] has forced my younger brother [13M] to move out and come live with me [19F] because my older brother [23M], his wife [25F] and child [2M] are homeless. She wants to turn my brothers room into a childs room. Are we right in cutting off contact with her?


As the titles says, my mother wants my little brother to come live with me while my older brother stays with her. I feel like I need to give a little bit of backstory.

Damian has always been a trouble maker, he would always get detentions, sent out of the classroom, etc. and he seemed to take pride in it. He is a compulsive ass hole and he managed to get a girl pregnant while he was in college. He has always been the golden child and he has always received the most attention from our Mother. My younger brother and I joke around saying we may as well call Christmas Damian Day. Seriously every important holiday was made to be all about Damian. 

Damian and his wife dropped out of College and never got any type of further education. Which is fine if you have a plan but he didn’t he just dropped out because he felt like it and mom was perfectly ok with it. God forbid the day the baby was born If I or my brother even breathed around it, it was like we just spat in god himself face. (no we are not religious, just an example).

Now Damien and his wife find themselves homeless and mom has invited them to come live with her. Here comes the problem my room has since been turned into a study which mom needs for work. Damian and his wife still have their room and mom want’s to turn Nicks room (little brother) into a child’s room So she has told me and Nick that we have no choice in the matter and he is coming to live with me. 

Nick is at my place at the moment and I still attend college and I have one roommate. My roommate is babying nick and I am to in a way because we feel bad for him. Thank god I attend college in my home state/city because I don’t know what would have happened if I didn’t. He is sleeping on the couch as of now and we have no idea what to do. My mother I feel has completely lost her mind and is out of control. My dad is dead so he can’t stop her from doing this. 

Right now the arrangement is that she will sign whatever the school wants her to sign for events. Honestly I took him in gladly and my roommate Rebecca agreed to it when I told her what was happening. But are we right in cutting off all contact from them unless it is absolutely needed to talk to them?

tl:dr: Mom has forced our little brother to come live with me. ( I would gladly take him in anytime, love him to bits) because our older brother and his family are homeless. She wants to turn our little brothers room into a childs room "
"My [26/f] boyfriend [32/m] keeps getting drinks with his female friend and I just found out she doesn't know I exist.


So I posted about this before but the whole situation got worse. The summary of the previous issue is that my boyfriend kept going out for drinks (an hour or two a few times a month) with this married woman, Lucy, who I'd never met. It wasn't a huge deal and I was only mildly uncomfortable about it (because he has cheated in a past relationship - not with me) but I never mentioned it to him. Then today things got worse. 


Last night my Boyfriend mentioned Lucy again and I casually told him I'd love to meet her. He said sure, no problem. End of discussion. I figured the problem was solved.


This morning my boyfriend spent like 4 hours tidying up the apartment and basically not talking to me much (not ignoring me, just being busy with other things, no problem). Around 2 PM I asked him if he's hungry, does he want to eat lunch. He said no, he's not hungry. So I sat in the kitchen alone and ate lunch while he had a beer alone on the balcony. Ok..... fine... 

Then right after I finished eating he told me:

Boyfriend: Lucy just texted me to see if I want to get some drinks. I'm going to meet up with her. Do you mind?

Me: Um... I guess not...

(he could tell I was uncomfortable)

Boyfriend: what's wrong?

Me: I mean, I was waiting for you all morning and even ate lunch alone and then now you're leaving to go see Lucy. I don't know, it's fine, go. 

Boyfriend: Why don't you come with us?

Me: Well you are leaving now and I haven't showered yet. Does she know I exist, by the way?

Boyfriend: She knows you are a friend of mine.

Me: ...a friend? She doesn't know I'm your girlfriend?

Boyfriend: No, little by little people will know. Just come.

Me: We've been in a relationship for 2 years, dude. We LIVE together! So you've been spending time with this woman I've never met who doesn't even know you have a girlfriend? If I came with you would you introduce me to her as your friend?! as your girlfriend?!

Boyfriend: Well... as my friend. Do you want me to introduce you as my girlfriend? I will do it if you think it's the right time

Me: Woah, don't turn this around on me and make it seem like I'm forcing you to introduce me as your girlfriend. This whole thing makes me really uncomfortable. 

Boyfriend: If you want her to know you're my girlfriend, then come with me and we will tell her.

Me: Don't you realize what an awkward situation that would be for me? ""Hello I'm Jessica! I've actually been in a relationship with your friend for 2 years but you knew nothing about it! Nice to meet you!"" 

Boyfriend: It won't be awkward, come!

Me: I am not coming and I'm actually quite upset with you.



Well, he left to go meet her anyway. Once he got there, he called me and told me to come again and I said no way. Then he called again but when I picked up he immediately handed the phone to Lucy, who told me to come. It was really really awkward and I asked her to please give the phone back to [my boyfriend]. I told him this was really rude and I'm very upset now. He just kept telling me to come on over.


He's still out drinking with her right now and he's treating the whole situation like a joke. He keeps texting me ""come over!"" and jokes and stuff like it's hilarious and silly that I'm upset about this. 


Am I overreacting or is this just really uncool of him and really bad relationship etiquette?

   
**tl;dr**: I found out that my boyfriend never even told this girl that he had a girlfriend. Now he wants me to come and introduce myself as his girlfriend but I think that's super awkward. "
"Me [35M] and my wife [32F], married 12 years. 2 kids: aged 10 and 8. Wife has become vegetarian over the past few months, become very annoying about what the rest of us eat. I basically want her to be quiet and stop bothering me about it because I've had it up to here.


My wife has become vegetarian, it started gradually and she became full time vegetarian as of 5 months ago.  She did it for health reasons but mainly for moral reasons because she believes eating animals is wrong.  Fine, I don't have a problem with that.

Early on, she tried to get me to become a vegetarian and eat less meat.  I tried it, I tried her dishes many times.  Usually various indian recipes.  I hated them, I didn't like the taste of it at all.

So normally what I do is we each cook our separate meals.  She cooks hers, I cook mine.  I always cook meat with mine (I love meat) and cook fish on Fridays.

With regards to the children, I always say let them choose what they want to eat. They can eat from mine or they can eat from hers.  They more or less usually choose mine, but eat from both, although mostly mine.

She always complains that I eat too much meat. I told her too bad, I like meat. I don't police what she eats, she doesn't have the right to police what I eat.

She's tried to bring it up many times but I always shut her down because I told her I find it REALLY annoying when she keeps telling me to stop eating what I like to eat. Its my life, my body, I choose what I put in  my mouth.

The other thing is about our children.  She says they should eat the vegetarian more and wants to gradually make them vegetarian like her.  I said they're both our children, neither of us should make unilateral decisions on what they can or can't eat.  She can't forbid them from eating something without my approval, and I won't forbid them from eating something without her approval.  Nobody stops them from eating the vegetarian, its there whenever they want it.  They simply choose more often than not to eat what I'm cooking.

She doesn't like that, I say what should I do? I'm not going to tell them ""no, you can't eat this, this is only for daddy"" and eat the food they like while they hungrily look on.  And I've already said I'm not going to switch to vegetarian, its not happening, she needs to get that through her head.  She always complains about the smell or the way my food looks ""that's really revolting, its really grossing me out"".  Okay, well, I find your food revolting too?

Basically she's become very annoying about the subject because as far as I'm considered, its settled, I'm not giving up my eating habits.  I'm not shoving pieces of meat in her mouth, she shouldn't try to shove her food in my mouth.

Its become really annoying, how can I get her to just drop the issue?
   
**tl;dr**: Wife is vegetarian, kids and I are not, she's become very annoying about it and is constantly trying to force us to change even though we don't want to.

edit: post is locked for some reason, can't seem to respond to the comments.  I thought I'd add, I'm not against eating vegetables.  I love eating vegetables, I love meat too.  They go hand in hand, its not mutually exclusive. Its just that the new recipes my wife got off the internet aren't great.  In any case, if she can manage to cook up something that I find palatable, I'd be willing to eat that provided I'm allowed to still eat a side of steak or some fish or something. I can't go without meat, I end up feeling still hungry afterwards and disatisfied.   But giving up meat entirely for one day a week? That would be like me forcing her to eat a meat dish once a week.  Its never ever ever happening, I can say now I'd sooner divorce before that happens.

I'll speak to her about getting a marriage counsellor see how she responds.  But hell will freeze over before I give up meat, even if its for one day a week.

As for our kids, they are getting older.  They are gonna be making more decisions. I doubt she'll be able to try to police their eating when they are 16 or 18."
"My (21f) bestfriend's (23f) makeup is so bad that I'm worried it will impact the start of her career.


I love my best friend; she's a beautiful intelligent girl who has a lot of potential. Both she and I are working on becoming teachers, but she has just graduated and is now looking for a job. I have no doubts that she will be an excellent teacher, but I am worried that how she wears her makeup will keep her from getting a lot of jobs because it is so unprofessional.

My best friend has always been very into makeup, but she isn't good at it, she just buys and wears a lot of it. It's not a difference of style, it's just that she's really, really bad at executing what I think she's going for. 


She regularly wears foundation that is several shades to dark for her and it's noticeable in comparison to her to the skin surrounding her face. She wears so much foundation that it isn't uncommon for her to go through a whole container of foundation in one week. For people who use foundation, you know how ridiculous that is. She applies upwards of 10 layers of mascara until it becomes kinky and clumped and she wears very bright, noticeable blush. This is her everyday makeup. She's been getting more into lipstick lately, but she often chooses very bold colors and so jagged application is very noticeable. One day I met up with her and I noticed she had dirt on her face so I helped her rub it off---except it wasn't dirt, it was bronzer, but looked indistinguishable from someone accidentally rubbing some dirt on their face.


I don't think I'm just being hypercritical of her makeup job, *many* of her close friends and SO's have warned her about it, but this is how she likes it. Upon meeting Her last ex's mom, the mom didn't realize that was her look and tried to wipe some of her foundation off because she thought she accidentally put too much on and didn't blend it right. 

I've tried to nicely state that her foundation isn't the right shade or that she doesn't need to put as much of everything on as she does, but she likes it how she does it.


The real problem is that her ""toning down"" her makeup is reverting to her everyday style as described above. 



She is wearing this kind of makeup to job interviews and has not had any success despite the fact she is in other ways well qualified and certified to teach a subject that is in high-demand.





I'm not sure the best way to help her understand that her makeup is really unprofessional and will likely be something that prevents her from being hired. I have told her she should take it easy on the makeup when she goes in for interviews, but she will send me a snapchat before she goes with a ridiculous amount of layers of poorly applied makeup.



Does anyone have advice?



**tl;dr:** Best friend wears way too much mismatched, poorly applied makeup. She is going into teaching and has been turned away after several interviews already. I think that her makeup may have an impact on her not being hired.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4og75k/me_23_mf_with_my_gf_24_mf_of_8_years_ive_been/

Thanks for all the comments and thoughts.

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

So I'm sad and newly-single. I've been going out drinking with a good buddy from work, and that has made me feel better. 

I still can't help thinking about her, but I hope that she'll be happy. I hope we both will be. :)

   
TL;DR: I broke up with her. Feeling sad for losing a long relationship, but also excited about all of the open doors."
"My (31 M) partner's (28M) grandmother passed away on Thursday, and his family left him out of the obituary because he's gay and adopted. He took care of her for 5 years.


I've been dating Kris for almost 8 years.  I know his family pretty well, and while his Mom is accepting, his extended family, not so much.   


When we first started dating, he lived with his Grandmother.  His mother was in Puerto Rico and none of her siblings really wanted to help to take care of the Grandmother, so Kris agreed to.  Mind you, the reason no one wanted to take care of her was because she was someone, who at times, was very judgmental, needy and controlling.  But there was definitely a special bond.  She genuinely loved Kris just as much (if not more) as any of the biological grandchildren.  

What I've sensed is that there may be jealousy towards Kris for their tight relationship.  After living with his grandmother for 5 years, it was time for him to move on.  He came and lived with me.  He was always on call, and since we lived in the same town, were available to help out with appointments, and whatnot.  However, since Kris was no longer there 24/7, the extended family became critical of Kris and more exclusionary.  I think they weren't happy about being inconvenienced.  They never treated him like real family, (besides his sister and his mom, who are genuinely good people), and became even worse  after he moved out.   

When she passed on Thursday afternoon, Kris was there.  He was absolutely heartbroken.  Today, I went on my Facebook account and saw that his Mom had posted a link to the obituary.  I had clicked it and was reading it when I noticed that whoever wrote it, had gone out of the way to list all 15 biological grandchildren's first name, but not Kris'. 

I was devastated for Kris.  He had put so much effort in making sure his grandmother had everything she ever needed.  He genuinely cared for this lady.  For them to leave him out pissed me off.  Big time.  These ""grandkids"" couldn't be bothered to stop in or anything when she was alive.  

Kris hasn't seen the obituary yet.  I'm sure he will once he goes on Facebook.  Should I bring this up to him? Should I hope he doesn't notice? Should I say something to his mom? I'm boiling in rage, at this point.  I want to bring it up to his family but I'm not sure if/what I'd say.  What does Reddit think I should do?"
"I [24M] found out the reason my GF [28F] keeps putting off me properly meeting her friends and I feel really low.


Sorry for the title, just want clarify I have met them a few times very briefly, but my GF always seems to want to keep that part of her life separate and tells me she prefers that our time is spent just the two of us. I thought it was odd she's keen on almost non of our time being spent in her friends company but I came to trust her reasoning and just left it alone. Been together one year now. 

Anyway, sometimes Terentia* uses my iPad if if her phone is on low battery and will often use imessage to text which she doesn't mind, we have an open policy with that stuff and we trust each other. So when she gave it back to me other night I went about browsing when a message banner appeared saying 'Why don't you just dump him?' I know snooping is wrong but I couldn't stop myself. 

There's no point reciting to whole conversation, but the gist of it is Terentia is embarrassed by the fact I'm a postman while she's a lawyer and doesn't want me mixing with the refined company she keeps. That really hurt.. I'm no bright spark but I have a history degree and i keep up with politics and general news so I'm not totally stupid, i don't think. I'm not putting my degree to use cause quite frankly I need some peace in my life, uni gave me sleepless nights and anxiety that drained me so my plan is to take it easy for some time and then start my career then. I pay for half our dates even though she says I don't need to so I'm not a mooch either. 

How do I get past this? I mean a close friend of hers thinks she should dump me. I slept on the sofa and just said I was unwell but she know's something is wrong (she can read me like a book). I don't think she knows that I know as I gave it to her straight after reading and just said I thought it was my message and didn't read it. 

How do I deal with this and work past it? I guess she's right about me. My mum has the same feeling even if she hides it.. being embarrassed of my job. I feel like shit right now.

"My(24f) college bf(24m) broke up with me when I took in my orphaned brothers(5/8). I am now dating someone new(35m) and my friends can't accept this.. How can I handle this?


When I was 22, I was a typical 22 year old. I was finishing up my degree, getting ready for grad school, enjoying life, and deliriously in love with Jamie- my high school sweetheart. Jamie was the perfect boyfriend and my friends all openly envied our relationship. Jamie and I had looked at engagement rings and were planning a life together.

However, when my father and stepmother died-everything changed. I was a mess. And my two little brothers were orphans. They were three and five, so little, and so sad. The only other options to take them in were strangers, people they didn't know.  Long story short, Jamie and I broke up and I am raising my brothers. 

We tried to stay friends, but it didn't work because neither of us could forgive the other for ""ruining us"". However, I now look back and don't bear him any ill will. I feel like he was part of another life and wouldn't fit in this one.

That's been about two years. I feel like I get this new life now and I like it. I love the boys and I feel like I'm doing ok at this- they're happy and healthy. I've even started dating again.

His name is not David, but lets call him that anyways. David was a family friend, extremely close to my dad, and has offered so much help and assistance. He even helped make arrangements for the funeral. Yes, he is 35. But we grew close and I deeply enjoy his company. We've started dating and honestly we're having a great time. He is witty and handsome and fits. He doesn't do big-romantic-movie gestures. He does the real little things and those matter to me.

That's where the drama has entered. A little before me and David made things official (but after our presence had been hinting at it, through pictures on social media, going certain places together) Jamie came back in the picture. He said that he was older now and more mature, that he regretted it all, etc.

I turned him down. He was not obligated to stay with me and I don't blame him for not being ready to take on it all, but the fact that he left means he's not the right man for me. He was upset and hurt. I feel a little bad but at the same time, he broke up with me after the death of my dad, when I had two little boys who were devastated and didn't quite get mommy and daddy weren't coming home.. I don't blame him- you can't live your life for other people, break ups hurt.

Here's the real kicker-my friends can't quite ""get"" that I chose David over Jamie.  That I am in like with David and happy...

My best friend Alexis in particular. She keeps saying things like ""Jamie was perfect"" ""Jamie loves you so much"" ""Remember when Jamie-"" and inserting cheesy stories of nice things Jamie did in college or high school.

I feel like this image they have of me and Jamie needs to fade. David and I threw a bbq this weekend. Alexis came, along with lots of other friends from college. She even mentioned that ""we should've invited Jamie- that would have been so much fun!"" And bringing up small stories of Jamie and how ""awesome"" he was.

Meanwhile, David was charming and wonderful, a great host who ignored her comments. I apologized afterwards and said she would not be over until I talked to her. He smiled and said it was fine. But I don't think it is ok for my friend to disrespect this wonderful person that way.

I brought it up and she disregarded it. ""Jamie was all of our friend- he still is my friend- and I was just talking"".

"My BF's of one year [31] friend [25] ""gifted"" him and married friend [31] prostitutes. Was I wrong for telling the friend's GF?


My boyfriend and two of his friends (Karl and Jasper) went on a trip to mexico. While there his friend Karl decided to ""gift"" my boyfriend and Jasper prostitutes. My boyfriend felt ""obligated"" to sleep with her and did. But this post isn't about what my boyfriend did or what I'm going to do about it. That's something I'm trying to figure out myself in therapy. 


So some backstory on Karl and Jasper. They're both pretty shitty people. Jasper is married but he and his wife are swingers. Cool, none of my business. However, before they got married Jasper had a year long affair with one of his wife's enemies. She found out about a separate affair a couple months before their wedding but decided to stay. She still doesn't know about the affair with her enemy. My understanding is that they are very happy together, are polyamorous and have a third, and are in the process of trying to buy a house and get pregnant. Jasper's wife gave him a free pass to do whatever he wanted this vacation. 

Karl on the other hand has been cheating on his GF since day one. He crashed with my boyfriend a couple of nights when he came to town and brought home a girl (not his gf) and had sex with her. He says he did it because his gf was just starting fights out of nowhere, he was only staying with her because she was watching his house and dog while he was out of town, and that he was going to break up with her as soon as he got back home. That was 8 months ago and they are still together, he's still cheating every chance that he gets. He planned this mexico trip as a vacation to screw as many girls as he could. I met his gf once and once there was a face to the cheating I started feeling guilty. However, out of ""loyalty"" to my boyfriend, I kept my mouth shut. 


So after I find out about the cheating, I tell my boyfriend that I no longer feel any sense of loyalty to his friendship with Karl and I was going to tell his GF about everything that I know. He asked me not to not because of his relationship with Karl but because Karl's GF knows about the affair with Jasper's wife's enemy. Jasper is my boyfriend's best friend and my boyfriend would get blamed for the end of his marriage. I told him I was probably going to do it anyways, if Jasper didn't want his marriage to end he shouldn't have done what he did. I told the GF and everything blows up. Karl's GF reaches out to Jasper's wife and tells her everything. The Karl and Jasper are attempting to point fingers at anybody but themselves. 


My boyfriend is incredibly angry at me and told me that I just ruined his friendship with Jasper and ended Jasper's marriage. All out of spite. My boyfriend told me that I'm an evil person for ending two other relationships because I'm upset with my own.  I tell him I don't feel guilty at all. It's not like I'm making up lies. My boyfriend, Karl, and Jasper's behavior is what is ending their relationships. 



After typing all this out I realize that it's just all a fucked up situation. I know what you all are goign to say. ""Birds of a feather flock together."" All three of them are bad eggs and throw all of them out. But I'm starting to feel a little guilty about Jasper and his marriage so I wanted to get some outside opinion. Was I wrong in telling Karl's girlfriend what I knew?


   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend and his friend slept with prostitutes. Shit blew up when I told friend's gf. Was I wrong?"
"Update: Me [18m], I found out one of my friends [18M] had been cheating on his girlfriend, now no-one believes me and I've been cut out from things till I apologise.


Update to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ooxzu/me_18m_i_found_out_one_of_my_friends_18m_had_been/

Thanks to the few who helped me in the first post and made me see things clearer. I would like to point out that I don't see the majority of my friends who didn't believe my story as ""bad people"" as Gavin is a very good liar and the only evidence I had was a drunk conversation, also I'm not a big fan of Gavin in the first place so most of them were thinking I was getting revenge.

So back to Sixth Form yesterday this story got a whole lot more interesting. It was awkward between me and my friends as Gavin and me weren't speaking (he's a bit of a keyboard warrior so he didn't say anything to my face), till someone brought it up and said I should apologise. I refused too, and told them I was telling the truth, I'm not apologising etc. This is when it developed into a full on argument with a few people siding with me (more so than when it was first revealed) as they said I seemed legit, a few people trying to calm down the situation and a few people siding with Gavin. When our lessons started we just went separate ways and except the people I'm in classes with, I never saw any of them till later in the day.

Well it all blew up as I see Hannah shouting at Gavin saying he's dumped, me and my friends who are there rush over whilst he's still trying to say it was Liam not him. Liam, being the little stooge he is tried to convince Hannah of the story again, but apparently she had proof this time it was Gavin. She saw me and sincerely apologised to me as I was telling the truth.

The story spread around fast as you can imagine. I got a few texts off my friends/some in person to say how sorry they were for not believing me and they didn't think Gavin was like that. So the people who have made the effort with me, I'll accept their apologies. However the people that haven't reached out, can go fuck themselves along with Gavin and Liam.


   
**tl;dr**: IT caused tension at Sixth Form, until Hannah found proof that Gavin was in fact cheating and that I was telling the truth. Most of my friends apologised, a few of them haven't so they as well as Gavin and Liam can fuck off."
"My [24F] sister [16F] woke up to see our step brother [17M] in her room. Parents say she dreamed. She swears she didn't.


So we're in this family mess right now.

Two nights ago woke up at night and saw our step brother (our dad married his mom) in her room standing over her. When he noticed that she's woken up he ran away. She went after him and woke up the parents and he played dumb and pretended to be asleep. To make it short, they didn't believe my sister. They said that it was a dream and she imagined it. My sister is 100% sure that it wasn't a dream. She's staying with me now.

So our parents are upset that she accused our step brother of that creepy behavior and want her to apologize to him and sort things out, she's sure that it all happened. My sister says she doesn't want to be alone with him anymore and she wants to lock her door at night, parents don't agree. Sister says that unless parents agree to that she's not going to come back home.

So I'm here right in the middle of this. Parents want me to bring her back. My sister wants me to take her side and protect her. I know I'm not going to kick her out of my flat. She can stay here if she wants to. She actually suggested that she'd rather move in with me permanently.

I want my sister to both be safe and feel safe. Even if she dreamed that moment, she believes it was real and living in fear isn't good for her. I know she's not making it up. I also know that my step brother is a nice kid but I know kids that seem nice can indeed do creepy things so I'm not blinded by it.

So what should we do? My sister is looking at me for direction here. Should I push my parents to allow her to live with me or push with the lock, or something else? 

   
**tl;dr**: sister woke up to see step brother in her room. Parents don't believe her and say she dreamed. She's staying with me now. Parents want her back but refuse to allow her to have a lock on her door or not be alone with step brother. She's looking at me for direction, what should I do?"

[Here's a link to my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4maa84/someone_23ish_f_messaged_me_23_f_telling_me_my/). I posted it a while ago so I'm not sure if anyone remembers but he was probably abusing me all along and I just thought he had a controlling personality. 

I've basically flip flopped on whether or not to break up with him for the past few weeks because he won't seem that bad to me and then he'll do something awful, but then he's apologetic after and has a good excuse for it and he's the perfect boyfriend again. 


I finally broke up with him because he took his sex games way too far and he hurt me badly. He's been harassing me so I moved in with a former friend with benefits and he started harassing him too and he came to his house and tried to fight him and is making all kinds of threats. It was crazy, he is such a violent person and I honestly didn't realize it before that girl messaged me. I was being so stupid before but I'm just glad she told me, that was a really nice thing to do.

"I [22F] want to cut off my sister [24F] after she admitted to selling my dog for drug money


My sister Luna has gone to AA and drug rehab in the past year. We are all in our twenties. Luna is [24F] and I am [22F]. We have a brother Daniel [26M] who I am close with but doesn't talk to Luna at all. 

I was supportive of Luna up until this past week. I went to a meeting with her, instead of my Mom [45F] who normally goes. I was introduced to the group and the meeting was about forgiving and honesty. During this meeting, Luna told me a few things I didn't know. 

- She stole $500 from me, which I thought was my boyfriend. I ended up breaking up with that guy over it. She said she would pay me back for the money.
- She sold my dog for drug money. The dog I thought ran away because someone left the gate open. 
- She has ""borrowed"" items and never brought them back. 

I sat there stunned because this happened within the last three years. She only recently hit rock bottom when my parents kicked her out for stealing my Mom's wedding ring. So I am not shocked. 

I have not lived at home for three years, and the dog disappeared right before I was going to move. 

I left the meeting. I have gotten calls from my sister telling me she is sorry, she didn't mean for it to happen. I told my Mom what happened and she has told Luna she needs to pay me back for the cost of everything and also replace the dog. 

Total, Luna would owe me about $4000 and I want her to pay me back for what she took. Luna said she wants forgiveness and she doesn't have the money, but she will try to. I told her I didn't know if her paying me back would make me want to have her in my life. 

I tried to be supportive, but she has caused so much pain and suffering. She let me break up with someone over the money, saying she saw him take it. I should have been smarter, but I never thought my sister would take the money from me or sell my dog to someone for drugs/alcohol. 

I am thinking of cutting her off and no longer having her in my life. 

Luna brought a puppy to my apartment, gave me the $500 and said she would make up the rest. The puppy is not the same breed as the other dog, but it's cute. I took the puppy but told her that it doesn't mean I am going to forgive her. 

Am I overreacting? I feel furious thinking about this. I called up my ex and apologized, but he told me that he didn't want to talk to me again. I told him I understood and there are no hard feelings. We have been broken up for about a year now and I have a new boyfriend. I have no interest in rekindling a relationship. But I do think that what Luna did crossed lines .

What do I do? 

**TL;DR** SIster admitted to selling my stuff/dog/stealing money during her drug days. "
"Updates My (34f) neighbor (30-40s?F) is accusing my lawn guy (16m) of being a peeping tom.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4onqyd/my_34f_neighbor_3040sf_is_accusing_my_lawn_guy/

I don't know if I linked the original correctly, but here's the update as it stands. And I want to thank everyone for their comments. I've tried reading them all and commenting when I can, but I've been running around doing last minute wedding stuff today. So...

I have just gotten off the phone with Officer X, the officer that left the door hanger yesterday. This is the gist of what's going on. Sheila is my neighbor.

- Sheila called the police department yesterday around 4:00 (so when I got home) to report a loose/aggressive dog. There is a leash law in my town.

- Officer X and his partner arrived around 4:10/4:15 and took Sheila's statement. She said my dog (I have two) was running around the neighborhood and attacked her when she got out of her car.

- Officer X came over to ask me about the incident, experienced the super excessive barking first hand, and left a note when I didn't answer the door.

- Officer X told Sheila that he left a note asking me to contact him on Monday, his next work day. Sheila was NOT happy about this. She was basically demanding that someone do something immediately about my ""dangerous breed dog"". My dogs are miniature Schnauzers. They weight approximately 12 and 15 lbs.

- Officer X told Sheila that there was no way to corroborate the incident since my dogs were both inside my house, not outside as she claimed. Sheila apparently said that the city police department is awful because twice she's reported crimes and nothing had been done.

- I filled Officer X in on what happened Wednesday when Daniel was here and about the conversation I had with Sheila on Thursday. Officer X said dispatch had notified him when he got the call Friday that the same individual had made a call Wednesday, was told it was a non issue, Sheila became ""disgruntled"". Apparently they keep tabs on callers in the event that they are just nosy neighbors.

- Officer X asked if my dogs are ever allowed to be out without being leashed. I told him we have an underground fence and the dogs are inside 99% of the time when they are home (they go to doggy daycare three times a week and we take them to our massive family farm at least twice a week). The only time the dogs are outside unleashed is when they are within our fencing to either relieve themselves (we have to let them out) or getting in and out of the vehicles. 

- I explained that there was no way either of my dogs were the loose dog (if there even was one) because they had been at doggy daycare until 3:50 and we live roughly 5 minutes from the daycare. I told him I will be glad to get a receipt from them Monday and he suggested I do so.

- Officer X also suggested I do two things. The first was to tell Daniel's parents about the incidents on Wednesday and Thursday. His reasoning was, with it being a small neighborhood, Sheila might ""share the story"" with the homes around her and it might come back negatively on Daniel. Since Daniel's father grew up in the neighborhood, the neighbors are familiar with him and likely to side with him rather than believe me (someone they don't really know) if Sheila has already told them her version of events. The second was to write up a letter to Sheila telling her that she is to stay off of our property and to cease any contact with us. Officer X said he would deliver it to her himself Monday, since I'm going to allow him access to my home to check the fencing situation and the laundry look out.

So it wasn't about Daniel, but Sheila did call to report the incident on Wednesday and was told out was a non issue. Why she still attempted to further the issue with me, I've no idea. My partner and I are getting married Friday and will be gone for the weekend, so I am going to have friends come by several times during those days to make sure everything is okay and she hasn't burned my house down or something (because she's clearly unstable).

I am going to tell Daniel's parents tomorrow afternoon before he gets back and give them all of the information (what happened, Thursday's incident, Friday's incident, and what Officer X suggested they do) and I'm going to make sure I'm home the entire time Daniel is working from now on.

TL;DR:

Sheila tried to get me in trouble for someone else's/a stray dog being unleashed and attacking her. The officer was not aware of what happened Wednesday, but was notified by his dispatch that she had made a call that day. The officer suggested I tell Daniel's parents and let them handle the neighbors since dad grew up there. Officer is coming Monday to check out the dog situation/the laundry room and will deliver a no contact letter to Sheila from us.

Sheila is clearly unstable and since I am getting married next weekend, I am having a few friends ride by and check things out at my house periodically those three days.

"Update: My boyfriend (45M) uses racial slurs during sex with me (32F) and I'm not sure what to do about it.


[original!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o0ivk/my_boyfriend_45m_uses_racial_slurs_during_sex/)

Hello everyone. First off, I want to say how completely overwhelmed I was by the amount of people who commented on my post. I honestly did not think it would get so many replies and upvotes and I am eternally grateful for the people that replied to me and gave me advice, helpful tips, or told me to get off my ass and leave this asshole. I want to thank each and every one of you for being so wonderful. Onto the update:

Since my (now ex) boyfriend was on a business trip, I moved my things out and moved back in with my parents. I didn't tell them about the racial slurs and other issues, I just told them he was abusive and they accepted that. My parents have been married for over 35 years and they know what a healthy relationship is and they were more than happy to take me in despite my shame of moving in with my parents at age 32. My dad is trying to help me with finding jobs and honestly, it's nice to be at home with my parents and spend time with them. I feel very lucky that I have this safety net available. 

Now on to my racist ex boyfriend. After I moved my stuff out, I told him I was leaving him via text message. He immediately called me and basically cursed me out calling me a ""worthless whore"" and telling me that ""no one will ever put up with you like I have"" and all kinds of other crazy stuff. He called me all types of horrible names and said that he just put up with me because he needed a ""n-word fuck doll"" and that he was glad to be rid of me because I was just a financial burden. I guess he really did just want someone to manipulate and use and after reading the replies here, I was not surprised in the least at his response. It did hurt though, it hurt a lot. I am going to need a lot of therapy to heal from this. I have made an appt with a therapist but because I am currently low income and my state has shitty mental health services, I wont be able to see someone until mid-August. All I can ask is that you guys pray for me. I will try and get through this and come out a better person. 

EDIT: In regards to finishing my Masters, I am going to continue taking the two courses I have over the Summer since they are already paid for and the refund date has passed. My Dad said he would be willing to help me out some to pay for the Fall. He and my mother are both retired and on a fixed income so they can't help a lot but every little bit is ok. I am going to work while attending school and since I won't have to pay any bills while at home, I am optimistic about being able to pay for Fall and then finish my MA program. 


**tl;dr**: Left my racist boyfriend and moved back in with my parents. Trying day by day to heal. "
"Update | Would it be wrong if I [23F-disabled] to ask my friend [23M] to have sex with me?Non


https://redd.it/4ny50g

Not much to update besides that I decided not to do it. As most of you have said good friends are in short supply especially for someone like me and I don't want to make things awkward between us. Even if he decided to be my FWB what would happen when he wanted to date someone else? He would need to end our friendship. I need a good friend more than I need a sexual partner.

I'll just keep waiting for the right moment with the right person. It might take a few more years but that's life.

My sister wants me to keep an open mind about the idea of a sex worker. I'm still not comfortable but I'll keep an open mind. But that's all I have to update.

Again thank you for reminding me of what's really important.

"(UPDATE) Marriage without sex. Should I [29M] propose to her [27F]?


[removed]"
"Me [25F] my husband [30M] won't sleep in our bed unless we have sex


We have been married for two months and a couple for 3 years. He decided that he won’t sleep in our bed with me unless we have sex. It doesn’t matter if we already had sex that day, he won’t sleep in our bed unless we have sex again at night.  I don’t even think that we have an issue with the amount of sex we have anyways, we have it most days, and if we don’t because I’m on my period or am not feeling well or whatever, he gets so grumpy unless I give him a blowjob. 


This started almost immediately after we got married. He has also become much more controlling. I was going to go out for my friend’s birthday party at a bar last night and he got mad that the dress I was wearing was short (“a good wife wouldn’t wear that”) and when I told him who was going to be there, a few of my male friends, he said I couldn’t go, which was really embarrassing to be honest. His reasoning was something like “what kind of man would I be if I allowed you to go out like that around other guys who obviously want to fuck you.”  That's just one of many, many examples.

I don’t know how I can get through to him. Any advice for me? Its really upsetting that he is treating me like a child incapable of making my own decisions, and that he is punishing me for not having sex with him. Are these normal growing pains for newlyweds?

"I [36F] adopted my friend son [14M] years ago. I heard from her all these years later saying she want's to be in his life. Now she has backed out and I have no idea what to tell him


Years ago my best friend (Sally) fell pregnant. We had just finished college and I was starting to get into my career. All sally could talk about was being a mother and how excited she was to be one. To this day have no idea what caused her sudden change in attitude, one day she called me crying on the phone telling me she was not ready to be a mother. I was pregnant with my own child at this point in time and I was ready to give birth in 6 weeks. She was due in another 12 weeks.

Sally wanted to put her child up for adoption. My ex-husband and I chose to adopt her child as our own. So we had two children Harry and Serena [14F]. My kids get along extremely well and are practically best friends. They are about to start High School after the summer vacation. Serena has always been protective of Harry and vice versa. Both kids are perfectly normal nothing mentally or physical wrong for the most part we are a normal family. My ex-husband and I divorced so it’s just me and the kids.

Up until 6 weeks ago I had not heard from his birth mother in years. Last I heard she moved to Chicago with her husband and started a life there. 6 weeks ago I got a Facebook message from her saying she was interested in meeting harry and being in his life. I had a long discussion with her and an even longer one with Harry about it. Harry seemed very interested in meeting his bio mom and he gave the OK to meet her.

So we set up a skype call with Harry and His bio mom and his bio dad. They spoke for a while and I noticed he was calling them by their first name. He called them David and Sally, he did not call them mom or dad. Which I was happy about selfishly because he has always called me mom.

Sally and David were supposed to come out next week to Pennsylvania and meet Harry. 20 minutes ago I got a Facebook message from Sally saying the following “I can’t stand to be around my child who does not refer to me as mom. I am sorry but I can’t come out and doubtful I will ever be able too” That is a bullshit excuse and she knows it, this is the exact same shit she pulled all those years ago. She commits to something and then backs out

She has since blocked me on Facebook and her phone goes right to voicemail. I have no idea how to tell Harry he was looking really forward to it. Harry is upstairs waiting for his girlfriend to get here and I have no idea what to say to him.

tl;dr: My sons bio mom was suppose to start being in his life and get to know him. She has now backed out with some bullshit excuse and I have no idea what to tell him "
"My [25M] boyfriend [28M] tried to screw over my best friend [26F] at work. I told her &amp; he got fired. He blames me now &amp; wants me to pick him or her.


Lots of background into this.

When I was 19 I came out as gay to my super religious family and was immediately disowned. They kicked me out, stopped paying for my education and stopped talking to me. I literally lost everyone in the extended family. I was all alone and unprepared. I was going to an expensive private university and couldn't afford it anymore, I had to drop out and start working full time.

At that time my friend Claire at the university really helped me out. At that time I didn't know that she was from a very rich family (she never lived to show it). She helped me with small things here and there, allowed me to stay with her until I could get my act together, she even paid for me to get therapy when I was dealing with abandonment issues from my family. Really the kindness that she did for me is something I'll never forget. We remained very close friends after that.

I didn't go back to college, just kept working at rather lower wage jobs. A few months after she graduated she asked if I would like a job. She wanted me to be her driver/assistant. She was working in their own family's business and her previous driver was a boring yes ma'am no ma'am old guy that she wasn't comfortable with. She offered me a superb salary and benefits (like 8x what I was making at my job at the time) and I accepted. I've been working for her for two years now and it's been very nice. The workload is low, I drive a super comfy expensive car, I get paid to spend time with my best friend and all in all this is yet another huge favor for me that she's done.

Here comes my boyfriend Jack. He works for Claire's family business. I met him about 18 months ago and he hates Claire. He believed she is a spoiled selfish girl who's only progressing because her dad owns the empire as he puts it. I didn't know that Jack hates her only until a few weeks ago when they apparently had a clash at work. I'm not aware of the details or whose fault it was since that's really not my job but I became aware of the conflict. Claire doesn't have strong opinions towards Jack though, when she learned that we were dating back then she told me that he seems like a good hardworking person.

Jack told me that he's going to put Claire in her place. I asked what he wants to do, he didn't say much except that ""she won't see it coming"". I kept pushing and he told me. It was basically messing up something that will make Claire look very bad and the confidence of others in her would take a huge hit. I begged him not to do it as it was not just wrong and unethical but just petty. He seemed to have made up his mind and I couldn't do anything to change it.

I really had no choice at that point. For one, I had to do the right thing. For two, Claire has done so much for me and I owe her so much in my life and as a result I have very strong loyalty to her. I couldn't sit and let something like this happen to her. So I told her everything. She appreciated my honesty and told me that she knows it must have been difficult to do this to my boyfriend and that she won't forget it. She took care of the whole thing. Jack was fired.

So now he's angry that I told her. He says that I picked her over him and I betrayed him. I keep telling him that I begged him not to do it but he put me in the position of having to choose to do the right thing or keep quiet and let him do something wrong to my best friend. He says he can't believe that I did it.

So now he wants me to show him that I love him and I'm loyal to him by cutting contact with Claire and quitting the job. I don't want to do that. Claire is my best friend and I owe her a lot. This job is great and I want to keep it. But I don't want to break up with him either. He made a horrible mistake and he's angry that he lost it. But he keeps pressuring me to make a decision and I'm just tired of it.

Is there any chance for our relationship?

"My [22F] boyfriend [24M] of 5 years has bought me a ""vanity"" engagement ring?


Hi all. 

So a few weeks ago a mysterious package arrived for my boyfriend and wouldn't tell me what was in it. I just left it as something personal. I was tidying up his shelves because he collects a lot of merchandise and it was getting dusty. We share a studio flat so space is limited and dust makes me sneeze so I have to keep it wiped down. 

I found two boxes I'd never seen before, they were white cardboard and said final fantasy on them. I opened one to see what merchandise my bf had forgotten to show me (he always shows them off) and inside one was an engagement ring. Yay right?  The issue is.. its an official final fantasy engagement ring and pendant cloned from Serahs.

Final fantasy is his favourite game in the world. I don't really like it much myself, I'll watch him play it but I won't play the single player games. I did play FFxiv for a short time but it was nothing super to me.

I looked it up and these sets were $229 each and he had bought 2. We have discussed marriage lately so I would assume he was planning to propose, why would you buy 2 if you were only buying them for merchandise?

I don't know how to react when he proposes. I feel like he's bought something special to him that has no relevance to me. I feel hurt, I don't want to look at this ring and just think about him comparing me to his favourite video game. 

What should I do? Should I tell him I found it? Shall I wait for him to propose? I don't want to hurt his feelings but I don't think he's considered me at all in his decision, he's just fanboy purchased this. 

Thanks a lot.

TLDR : Boyfriend bought me a final fantasy engagement ring because he loves the game and I don't like it myself.

Edit: ive updated some info for clarification. I'm not trying to come across as a materialistic bitch, I still wear a cheap ring he got me 4 years ago that turns my finger green. "
"My [early20s/F] sister [late twenties] is youtube/instagram famous and won't respect that I don't want any part of her videos/media presence and don't want to be in her wedding party because it will be all over it.


I'll use some fake names to make this a bit easier. I've been intentionally vague ages just because giving that information *might* make it possible to work out who my sister is and therefore who I am. 

I'm one of 4 siblings. Vanessa is the oldest and in her late twenties. Thomas is about 2-3ish years younger and then there is myself and my twin brother Matthew who are in our mid-early twenties and a couple of years younger than Thomas. 

So Vanessa is very into the whole YouTube/Instagram 'celebrity' scene and started with makeup tutorials now and has a pretty famous youtube/instagram channel with her faincee who we'll call Jeremy. In the beginning, it was just a thing Vanessa did but it really sort of took off an exploded over the last couple of years and Vanessa and Jeremy now has several hundred thousand followers with their ""daily life"" Vlog. 

Thomas and his fiancee are now getting into the whole Vlogging stuff, kinda piggybacking off the success with Vanessa and Jeremy.

Matthew and I have absolutely zero desire to be ""internet famous"". A couple of reasons. It is just not just my thing firstly, I'm someone who doesn't really like attention. I'm not only on the quiet/introverted side as is (which can come across as awkward), but I also suffer from anxiety and am quite thin skinned and wouldn't really be able to handle the 'haters' side of it. It is a big reason I don't want to be all over this.  Matthew just thinks it is all stupid. And neither of us like being bugged by their fans. Like when Vanessa tagged us in a picture (despite us asking her not to upload/tag is in pictures), I had to clear 500+ follow requests and change my instagram name.

The problem is now  

But Vanessa and Thomas want all these family events to be part of the vlog and are having trouble respecting that Matt and I do not want this. Vanessa is annoyed I don't want to be in her wedding party because she plans to vlog all the bridesmaids stuff, they are annoyed Matt and I don't want to go to a surprise party she is planning to throw for our mother's birthday because it ill be all over the internet, you get the idea and it is causing a ton of arguments and is the huge reason I am planning to move to Europe for graduate school.....I want to be away from it all. Vanessa was annoyed when I didn't want a siblings day pic uploaded on her Instagram because 'now I look like a bad sister'. All she cares about is how she looks to her followers, not how we actually feel about it. Our mother keeps encouraging us to be more 'open minded' about it because of the financial benefits to Vanessa (and hopefully Thomas, because that is what he wants) but I'm not willing to sacrifice a large part of my privacy for Vanessa's financial gain. 

The wedding thing is also become a huge issue and my parents think I should suck it up because it is Vanessa's wedding and 'her way', but the mere thought of being filmed all day makes me feel like I'm going to have a panic attack. I am worried about the long term implications for the family relationships if I don't do it. 

How can Matt and I force Vanessa (and Thomas) to stop being so self centred and make her understand that while she might be making the choice to put herself and her life out there, it doesn't mean the rest of us want to. 

**tl;dr: Sister is a youtube celebrity / instafamous but won't respect that myself and my brother don't want to be a part of it all.    how can we best enforce boundaries?**"

"Me [22F] &amp; brother [22M] with childhood trauma. Boyfriend said ""he's too damaged and beyond anyone's help"". I kicked him out.


My brother and I (twins) had a nightmarish childhood. Both our parents were criminals and violent. They were angry at everything and everyone and always unleashed that on me and my brother.

When we were 16 we ran away from home. We lived on the streets for a while until we were able to rent a room together. When we were 19 our dad was killed by the police. Our mom killed herself a few months later so we got their stuff. We sold their house and bought a new one and that's where we live right now.

We focused on getting professional help, trying to heal and moving on. I've been able to do that. Now I have friends, I'm in a relationship for a year with my boyfriend and my life is pretty normal. My brother however has struggled. His progress has been much slower than mine and he still isn't in a great shape. He struggles with making friends and having relationships. Therapy helps and he's getting better but it's a long and slow process for him.

My boyfriend hasn't really been helpful to be honest. He thinks I shouldn't help my brother since I don't owe him anything and that he's and adult and responsible for his own problems. Last night we woke up because we heard my brother screaming in his sleep (it sometimes happens, though not often anymore) and I went to his room to help him calm down and go back to sleep. He has nightmares about what our parents did to us. This morning boyfriend told me that my brother is a mess and he belongs in a mental institution. I didn't like what he said so I told him that I don't need his ""expert"" psychological opinion. He continued that I should cut him lose since he'll never be a good brother for me as he's too damaged and beyond anyone's help. I became angry and told him that he should leave.

I'm very upset with the things he said. I find his comments not only out of line and insulting but also very wrong. He texted me a ""I'm sorry if I upset you"" apology. I don't know what I should do with him. 

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend called my brother ""too damaged and beyond anyone's help"". I got upset and kicked him out. He's giving me a half apology. Should I forgive him?"

OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nh2um/me_20m_with_my_sister_27f_i_made_a_rude_remark/

While my post didn't get much attention, I want to thank the person who gave me advice. And if anyone else is reading this and in a similar or related situation, I hope this helps. 

I served my sister with eviction papers, and things got messy. I thought they would, so I called the police before, and took pictures of all my belongings the night before. She ended up breaking some stuff, and then the police forced her to leave. I heard she is living with a friend right now. I plan on suing her for all of my stuff she broke. I also decided to cut contact with my family. They chose trailer trash over me, but I expect they will come groveling back for ""favors"" and ""loans"" in a few months. 

TLDR: Always evict crazy, and don't get social media. "

"Update to ""Me [31M, European] with my girlfriend [29 F, Chinese] of one year; very different cultural expectations of financial management""


**[tl;dr of previous post](https://redd.it/4kyqgf)**: my Chinese girlfriend of almost a year thinks that, if and when we get married, I would deposit all of my money and income into an account solely in her name. I'm not comfortable with that. I'm also not comfortable with her sending all of our excess money back to her parents in China.

Apologies for the length. I'm a bit out of it, so this isn't the most concise writing I've ever done.

First, I'd like to thank everyone for their feedback from my previous post. It gave me a lot to think about: about the strong cultural differences between us; and about some specific personal issues too.

On sending money to her parents, and ""filial piety"" in general, I decided that I didn't really have any claim on how she spent money on her family, and the cultural institution was too deeply ingrained to try and tackle it. So long as we had separate income and savings, I think it makes sense for her to fulfill her duty to her parents if she sees fit.

On a wife controlling all finances, there seemed to be much less consensus as to whether or not that was normal, or the done thing. In spite of some people thinking that it might be a good idea, I definitely still wasn't on board. It also annoyed me how we were splitting bills was heavily weighted against me, but she still made me feel guilty any time I asked her to pay for anything.

Then, something that I didn't ask about, but came up anyway, was how we shared responsibilities in the relationship outside of money. She has very specific and strict ideas about what I guess you would call chivalry. In her view, men should treat women like princesses all the time: carry handbags, umbrellas, shopping, opening doors, walking on the right side, paying for everything obviously, taking up as little room in bed as possible, cooking meals, cleaning her flat.

There have been a few examples of her being careless about my money. The worst was a few months ago, we were due to take a trip to my home country. A week before we got into a fight, and she told me to cancel our accommodation reservation. I thought this was the first step in a break up, which (at the time) horrified me. I canceled the reservation but begged her to reconsider. After I apologised and she got over her anger, she was shocked to learn that we had nowhere to stay for our holiday. In the end I booked a much more expensive last minute hotel on the understanding that we would split the cost. Months later, she still hasn't paid me back, and she sulks every time I bring it up.

All this made me start to look at her, and how she spent money in a new light. Shout out to /u/ralpher1 for predicting almost exactly which brands of handbag she owned. I did some research on her favourite bags and shoes and scarves, and at a guess, I would say she about thirty thousand pounds worth of luxury goods that she liked to wear and carry often. I had no idea clothes and accessories could cost so much money. I'm not exactly anti-materialist, but I was shocked by this. I figured that spending habits would have to be part of any conversation on our futures together.

I didn't want to give up on what I thought was a good relationship just yet, so I decided to take a risk and open up to her about my financials. I showed her a summary of my income, expenditure, budget and savings. This was a mistake. She pretty much immediately started talking about what we could buy with my savings; and saying that I wasn't earning enough money so I should stop messing around with computers and go back to working in finance (which is not going to happen). I tried to explain to her that I was showing her this so she could see how I lived my life, and how savings were for the future, not so that she could plan to expand her lifestyle now. We went on for hours back and forth. I think somebody called it in the last thread, but she really did think ""what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine."" I don't even know if she ever came to understand how I would have a problem with that. It seemed so natural to her that I think she couldn't even see my side of things.

I did learn that she doesn't have any money saved at all. She does earn a lot, but she feels she has to send any money left over at the end of the month back to her parents. That's why she lives an extravagant lifestyle buying luxury goods: if she doesn't have any money then she doesn't have to send it back. I still don't really know what financial situation her parents are in. They might not even need the money, for all I know, but they all feel that her sending it has to happen.

The next morning, she asked me to move to Singapore with her. She wanted to be closer to her parents, and since we were planning our futures together... This pretty much blew my mind. I was trying to figure out if there was anything left to salvage in our relationship. I'd built up a lot of resentment over being treated like a eunuch servant and being expected to hand over all my money for the privilege. She thought that was a good time for us to move to the other side of the world.

So I told her I was breaking up with her. At this point, I don't know if the two of us were ever on the same page about anything, because she never saw this coming. She was distraught, and didn't know why I was unhappy, and she'd do anything to keep me, I was the best thing that ever happened to her. I fell for this for a couple of days, before she got screaming angry at me for breaking a wine glass while I was washing dishes (I'd argue we were equally at fault). She demanded I pay for it (holy crap, how much money can a wine glass cost), and apologise for being careless. I wish I could say I did something cool like just leave cash on the table and walk out. But I argued back and got dragged into the whole thing.

I ended up replacing the glass, and apologising. But the next morning I gathered all my stuff from her place and took it home before she woke up. I came back later, woke her up, and told her we had to break up. I'd already explained all the reasons why last time we talked, and I was afraid that she would manipulate me into staying again, so I walked out right after telling her. A cowardly way to do it, I know.

That was last weekend. Feeling pretty numb, with a lot of anger and resentment underneath the surface. Now that I'm away from her, I see she treated me really badly for pretty much the whole relationship. I'm pissed at myself for not standing up to her and her tantrums and selfishness sooner. I don't know why I let her get away with it for so long.

&lt;edit&gt;
Quick note that my ex is Shanghainese, not Singaporean. She wanted to move to Singapore to be close enough to visit her family, but still be able to find high paying work in her field.
&lt;/edit&gt;

**tl;dr**: We broke up. I think we had both compromised as much (and more) than we were willing and we still hadn't met in the middle."

"I (27f) am getting married to my fiancé (29m) in England in 3 weeks. My best friend and bridesmaid (27f) back home won't come unless I pay for her boyfriend to come as well


As the title says I am getting married  in 3 weeks to my fiancé who I have been with for 5 years.

I am originally from the US and met my fiancé while on holiday in England. I moved in with him very shortly after meeting and we have been together since. 

My fiancé has a well paying job and has offered to pay for plane tickets for 5 people, my best friend being one of them. The rest being family. 

I am working a retail job at the moment, so money on my side is not great. 

Now, my best friend (Paige) agreed to be my bridesmaid almost a year ago and I bought her ticket a month later. In the mean time she has started dating a man (28M) who I have not met or associated with in any sense. 

She messaged me on Facebook last night asking me to pay for a plane ticket for her boyfriend and when I declined she said that unless I pay for his ticket, she will not come to my wedding. 

I am at a loss for what to do. She's a huge part of this ceremony and my life. But I just don't have the money to pay for it. Should I bite the bullet and put it on my credit card? 


TL;DR Best friend and bridesmaid won't come to my wedding abroad unless I pay for a plane ticket for her boyfriend of a few months who I have never met. 


Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice. I have decided to contact her and ask her if she's serious and if it's maybe her boyfriend forcing her to ask. I will then make my decision on how to proceed from there. I'll update as soon as I have a final answer. You have all been wonderful and I truly appreciate every single one of your responses. "
"I [28M] know my GF [28F] is not telling the truth about going to yoga classes


Sorry for the English, not my first language! 


Okay, I am hoping that someone will just tell me I am stressing out about nothing.


**Short background story:**


Me [M28] living together with my GF [F28] for about a year or so, together for 4. We both have a good relationship and nothing out of the ordinary.   



I work at a delivery company that does express deliveries all over the province I live in. Because we have Express-shifts we have to take a delivery van home everyday. We can also use this van for private trips.


The company sometimes has to deliver very expensive goods; therefore, the vans are equipped with a GPS tracker that can locate the van at any given time. 



A few months ago my GF started taking yoga classes in the evening. So when we both got back from work, we would eat and (In case I was not on Express-shift) she could take the van to her yoga class.


We live very close to a border (Europe has open borders, yay!), but we can only go to other countries with permission of the company (It’s an insurance thing as far as I understand).


Last week my supervisor told me that in 9 cases my van was in the neighboring country in the evening without permission. This was very odd, because she told me where she had the Yoga classes and this was definitely not out of the country. I knew I couldn’t go out of the country so I am sure I didn’t. I didn’t tell my supervisor about the yoga thing, but I asked him for the exact locations so I could take a look at it.



**What I found out was:** 


•	All the 9 times where exactly the times she had taken the van.

•	Retracing Whatsapp times from the “On my way!” to the time of departure are a match.



I got home that day and decided I was not going to ask her upfront. However, I did ask her where she had the yoga classes and she said the same place as last time. So she is basically denying that she was in another country. During the evening I made up a bullshit story that a coworker got in trouble for driving over the border without permission. She seemed a bit shocked or somewhat but did not give any ordinary response or anything.


The address I have is just a parking spot in some neighborhood. I drove there last night with my private car to see if I could find anything but it’s just houses and a park. A quick Google search shows no yoga things anywhere around.


I could follow her the next time she has yoga class, just to see where she is going and then confront her afterwards. Or should I just tell her right now? This is all really stressing me out at the moment. Any advice would be great!
  


**tl;dr**: GF says she is going to yoga, but the company GPS tracker says otherwise.


**EDIT** Holy shit, this exploded! I will check your answers asap.


**EDIT2**: I will give an update as soon as I have confronted her. This will only be possible on Friday (Night shifts etc). I've read all you comments and I would like to highlight / clarify some of those:


* In my country a car is either insured or it's not. Anyone can drive it as long as there is insurance on the car.
* There are a few scenario's which I can find in the comments. I know I am hoping its not cheating, but I think that is the most obvious.
* She has used some drugs in the past (recreational), but has not done this anymore for a long time. I would highly doubt she would hide it from me if she was using drugs, since she told me about her drug past in the very beginning of the relationship and she is very open about it. She also doesn't look any different as normal. This also makes me think that smuggling across the border is highly unlikely.
* I know everybody is telling me not to be a detective, but I wan't to confront her face to face which is only possible on Friday. In the mean time, I have been doing some detective work to kill the time. What I have found out is that she has 2 girls in her Facebook friends list that live in this village where she has been going. I do not know them, nor has she ever spoken to me about them. I managed to pinpoint the exact address of one of these girls and they pretty much match with the location the GPS pointed out (Don't worry I will not go there, I can just use this is she would deny anything).


I will give an update as soon as I have confronted her!

"UPDATE!!!- me (f,24) with my girlfriend (f, 23) she found out a secret from a few years ago that I preferred wouldn't have gotten out and now she's mad at me and saying I lied to her


[link to original](https://m.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4owvrr/me_f_24_with_my_girlfriend_f23_she_found_out_a/) 

well reddit I know how much you love it when updates tell all about the crashing and burning of a relationship but unfortunately for you guys (and fortunately for me) this is a happy one!! 

okay I just wanted to clarify that I don't have any contact with the girl who murdered someone anymore. most of the letters are from before the trial when it first happened, and then there's like 10 or so that she's sent me over the years asking how I'm doing and stuff. 

also, yes it happened over a boy (isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard of) but the keyword here being BOY as in the girl who did it is not gay whatsoever so April would not be in any danger by a jealous ex when she got out, and also she isn't getting out for a long long time anyways. 

now to the update!! 

April told me her sister needed her to watch her nieces for the rest of the day, so she wasn't gonna be able to talk that morning before I went to work. 

I was disappointed because I got some great advice on here and wanted to try it out and talk to her about everything. 

well, when I got home there was a bouquet of flowers sitting on the coffee table with a note that said ""I'm sorry, I love you"" 

I was confused because April said she was gonna be at her sisters all day, but then when I walked in the kitchen April was sitting at the table looking really nervous. 

turns out, April only had to watch them until the morning like usual and she only told me that so that she could go to the store and get everything without me calling her because we usually always eat lunch together on our lunch breaks. 

she had made my favorite dinner (chicken Alfredo, if you're wondering) and my favorite dessert and had been doing that all day waiting for me to get home. 

she sat me down and started saying how sorry she was that she reacted like that, that she was just shocked and a little hurt that I didn't tell her that but she said she realizes now that she didn't have any reason to be hurt and that I don't have to share anything with her until I'm ready. 

by now I was crying because it felt so good to hear that from her, and I told her that she's still very much the only girl in the world for me and that I can't wait to marry her someday. 

so as we ate dinner I decided to open up for the first time in 7 years. I told her all about my teenage years, my friend that killed someone, the murder itself, the trial and everything in between. 

she started crying (sorry we're both some very emotional girls lol) and saying how sorry she was that I had to go through that and she understands now why I wouldn't want to talk about it. she said, once again, that she was sorry for how she reacted and she was ashamed of it, that it was just a knee jerk reaction to finding out about something like that. 

so after a very emotional dinner we decided to go to the theater and watch finding dory and have a little date night. 

all night it was obvious something in our relationship had changed. I felt such a huge relief to not have that chip on my shoulder anymore and now that everything was out in the open, I don't know how to describe it. our bond just felt stronger, maybe? even though that sounds super cliche lol. but if anything, she just reassured me that we can take on the world together and she loves me for me, not who I was as a teenager. and that feels damn good. 

anyways, 

tl;dr- I love this girl more than anything in the world and everything worked out. she also makes some bomb ass chicken Alfredo. "
"My(21F) mother told a few of her(43F) friends that my fiancé(26) and I are pregnant after we explicitly told her not to tell anyone.


EDIT: Update at bottom of this post!

So a couple of weeks ago my fiancé and I found out that we were pregnant. We both did not see it coming as I have fertility issues and we miscarried last year. Upon finding out we were shocked but cautiously optimistic as the doctors say, we geared up and made the doctors appointments to get blood work done to ensure my hormones were fine and to take all the precautionary measures to ensure that I do not miscarry again. 

So for the first week my morning sickness hit me like Thor's hammer and I spent most of the week out of touch and my mother showed up at my house unannounced, which isn't unusual behaviour for her but found me throwing up. Of course she was worried and I ended up telling her the great news but that I've been having a hard time because I felt very ill. She was besides herself, she was so happy! 
She asked how far along I was, I obviously wasn't entirely sure as I had not even had my first doctors appointment or scan yet to determine how far along I was. But based on my period tracker I am probably about 5 weeks. 

Now, I have had 2 miscarriages in the past due to infertility issues and my mother was aware of these, so upon finding out I told her that it was my fiancé and I's wish that no one knows until 12 weeks, not even closest family. She agreed and said she was so excited and she checked up on me every few days after that. 

Skip forward a week and I see her at a social event that a bunch of friends and family were invited to and I found out that she not only told my FATHER, but also her friend! They hugged me and congratulated me but all I could feel was dread and sadness. I've had complications in the past, I've experienced what it is like to lose my baby and now if that does for some reason happen again I would have to tell them, more so my father and break his heart. 
I found out that my mother asked her friend not to tell me that she knew. 
I smiled and thanked them and didn't get the chance to speak with my mother. 

The next day my fiancé and I went to the hospital after a whole lot of blood and pain to find out that we miscarried. They confirmed this with blood results and found that my HcG levels were lowering after a period of a few days. I cried, I cried and I cried. My fiancé and I are mourning and hurt. We lost our little baby and now we had to share the information with the very few people who knew. 

My fiancé called my mother and my father and told them what happened, they shared their condolences and said that they would give us some space to grieve. The last few days have been so difficult, but THEN I got a message from my mothers mum, who I never really knew and who is a stranger- congratulating me on my amazing news of motherhood and that she couldn't wait to see another baby in the family. 

I had to tell a fucking stranger the most intimate thing i could, that my fiancé and I lost a piece of us. She didn't deserve to know? I didn't even know that she knew! 

I am fuming, I am disgusted, I am heartbroken, I feel like she broke my trust. I don't even want to talk to my mother, I want to yell at her, make her see how much she has hurt us for doing what she did. I feel like this has damaged our relationship greatly. 

Where do I go from here, Reddit? Do I let it go? Do I sit her down and confront her? I have left her a message explaining that i know that she told her mother but she is asleep. I don't know what she will say but I don't even want to listen. 

TL;DR: Found out that I was pregnant, told mother reluctantly, she told my father and her friends knowing that there is a history of miscarriages. Ended up losing the baby, don't know what to do 


UPDATE: first of I'd like to thank everyone for their private messages and comments, the last 24 hours have been pretty difficult. My fiancé would like to thank all of you for your advice and the majority of redditors felt the best course of action was to let my mother know she hurt me, put her on an information diet and take some time to ourselves to grieve. So here's what happened: 

When I posted to /r/relationships I was already in bed and my mother was asleep.

 I messaged her saying: ""You said you wouldn't tell anyone! Then you told ___ AND dad and __, dad I can handle, __ is your best friend I can understand- but this hurts me so much mum. I am so angry- I told you in confidence that you would wait till 12 weeks and you said you would. She just messaged me to congratulate me and I didn't even know she knew. Do you know how that feels? I had to tell a woman I hardly know, or am still getting used to that I've lost my baby. Please do NOT share that information with anyone again. Who else have you told?"" 

Some people pointed out that this was not the correct thing to say as it excused her for telling my Father and her best friend. My mother was asleep at this point and her response was the following when I woke up: ""you don't have to tell me next time you're pregnant. Sorry.""

That's it, no heartfelt apology, nothing. I didn't even start mentioning the fact that I'm most certainly not going to tell her anything in the future as important as this. Also, she didn't answer my question about who else she told which leaves me to wonder how many people she really told. 

My fiancé messaged her the following:
 ""Can you please call all the people you have told about xx and I being pregnant and tell them that we had a miscarriage. xx can not handle being contacted and being told congratulations. We are struggling with our loss already, trying to grieve without needing strangers wanting to know how the baby is doing. Please, clean up this mess. We will not be going out on Friday night and xx and I need some time to grieve and process things so we will not be talking to you for a while, please do not try to contact us.""

I am fuming, I guess I expected her to be more remorseful, to be genuinely upset that she hurt us. It seems like she just pulled a half ass apology to get me to shut up, we will not be telling her anything that is this important in the future. 

For now my fiancé and I are going to grieve, carry on with our lives and try to get through this one day at a time. 

To everyone who has shared their same experiences, I am incredibly sorry for all of your lost little babies, the pain will go away some day."
"Offended everyone at work because I [24M] didn't recognize my coworker with a hijab on


I worked for a company all through school so last year they were ok with me taking the year off to travel before settling down. I just got back this week and it's mostly the same people on my team with a few new people. Tuesday we had a team meeting where I was welcomed back and I introduced myself to the new people. Unfortunately for me one of the people who I thought was new was someone I worked with for 3 years before leaving and I guess she decided to start wearing a hijab in the time I was gone. So I introduced myself and she said ""no its me, (name), do you not remember me?"" and it took me a long time because she looks completely different with a hijab on and I still wasn't convinced she was the same person. When I did clue in I said something like ""oh wow you look completely different with the hijab"" like a fucking idiot and everyone in the room turned and gave me a death stare like they were horrified I would point it out. 


Anyways I tried to just carry on with the meeting but when I would talk the old ladies I worked with would just raise their eyebrows and look away. Asked my friend about it later to find out if anything weird happened that would garner such a reaction but there's nothing. I apologized to the girl and she was still upset so I tried to just drop it. Yesterday I went to talk to some of the people on my team for help with something and one woman cut me off to tell me I was a sexist asshole for not recognizing her and said she wears the hijab because of people like me and the other women were nodding in agreement. Everyone's treating me like shit now and these women used to really like me. So is what I said sexist? I really didn't recognize her with the hijab, I didn't think there was anything sexist about that but everyone else seems to think so. If I was wrong, how should I go about thinking this? Defending myself and saying I'm not sexist hasn't been working too well for me. 


**tl;dr**: I didn't recognize a former coworker because she started wearing a hijab which apparently makes me a sexist prick, how do I fix this?"

"Should I[23F] tell my cousin[30F] that she's the reason she's not in a relationship/married?


She's staying with my husband and I for a while, she's bitter about not being married or even having a boyfriend. She's the one that scares them off.

1. She asks about their salary on the first date.

2. She wants to party 24/7 but wants a husband and kids. Men that want the whole white picket fence thing don't normally party all the time.

3. She expects them to pay for everything. Along with flowers everyday.

4. Doesn't work or go to school and lives with her mom.

5. Dates married men.

6. The questions. Holy shit the questions, she grills people and expects them to have an explanation for everything they do. I.e. Why did you get Steak? Don't you like chicken? Why not? What if I made it?

7. Sleeps all day. Wakes up at noon and complains that there's no breakfast.

8. Jumps every guy she see. She'll ask them to carry her around or buy her something within 30 seconds of meeting.

No one says anything about her behavior. Should I tell her so she can mature a bit?
   
**tl;dr**: She's jealous that I'm married but she refuses to act like a normal person. Her behavior sends men running."
"My (23) husband (32) threatened to kill me when he was angry


My husband of 1 year, together for 3, has always had anger issues, which has led to him screaming and yelling, breaking things, breaking and knocking down doors, and harming/cutting himself in front of me. I am constantly walking on eggshells around him, and even the smallest thing will set him off. Ive always suffered from anxiety, but my anxiety has become absolutely unbearable since being with him. A few weeks ago, we got into a fight and it led to him getting his gun and threatening to kill himself. I said I would call the police, and he threatened to shoot me too. I immediately cowered in fear and shut my mouth. The next day, I called my parents and explained what happened, and ended up staying with them for a week. 


I don't trust him at all. He has lied about so many things in the past, such as drug use, hiding money from me, even wrecking my car and hiding it for weeks. Now that he has threatened me, I don't even trust him in our own home.


I've gotten mixed opinions from family members and friends. Some say I should GTFO, some say to keep working on it and have him go to anger management, therapy, etc. I just don't know if that's enough to repair years of damage and such a horrible threat.


I should add that I have a good support system and many have offered me a place to stay, but I'm currently unemployed. I graduated a month ago and I'm frantically looking for a job, but nothing yet. 


Is this something that can be/should be fixed? Should I GTFO and stay with family until I find a job? Or stay the way things are?


TLDR; angry husband is scary and we have other problems, should I keep trying or cut my losses and go?


EDIT: Wow, thank you guys so much for your advice. 100% of you think I should leave and that makes it pretty clear what I need to do at this point."
