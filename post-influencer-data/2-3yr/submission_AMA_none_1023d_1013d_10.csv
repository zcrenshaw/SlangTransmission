"AMA, then change the question so I look like a sociopath


I got this idea from another AMA about 75 days ago. Go ahead, ask me ANYTHING!

Edit: Sometimes I'll take a while to answer, sometimes I'll be immediate. I'm trying to play Just Cause and listen to Spotify at 3AM

Edit 2: Holy shit this blew up! Also, Im not old enough to get a job, get married, etc. Please stay away from these questions!

Edit 3: Based on some of these, this belongs in r/roastme"
"I rode an elevator with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire last night. AMA


So I work in a restaurant that celebrities come into every night. There is one bathroom for the entire staff to use and it always has a few people in line waiting. They don't want cooks walking through the dining room during service so we take the elevator downstairs when we need to use the bathroom or grab something from dry storage/the produce walk-in.

My Chef saw me doing the pee pee dance, (couldn't leave the line during service so I was holding it for like 3 hours) waiting in line and asked why I don't go use the new bathroom they put in. 

""Go down the stairs and walk through the door and it's right there."" 
""Oh man, thank you so much chef.""

So I go looking for 5 minutes and wind up in the parking structure where the valet parks the cars. I'm getting in the elevator to go up and a car parks and three guys get out. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and some other dude. They pointed at the elevator and said ""we can go up this way right?"" and I held the door for them. Leo had his hat kind of low and was just staring down at his phone but Tobey asked me how my night was going and looked like he's been doing mass amounts of cocaine.

Go ahead, AMA."
"We are middle school kids in West Africa learning science and technology through the Level Up Village program run by Exponential Education. Ask Us Anything!


**TL;DR â€“ Talk to kids we are supporting in West Africa who are dissecting stuff!**

My name is Meagan Allen, I'm a volunteer with an NGO called Exponential Education in Ghana and I'm here now with some of our students from Ejisu Model Junior Secondary School, Frank, Dzifa, Faustina, Janet, and Aba. Ask us Anything!


Here in Ghana, the education system has many challenges, including an over-reliance on rote learning, lack of funding and resources in general, and under/poorly-trained teachers.


To help counter these challenges, Exponential Education runs various after-school programs, ranging from our flagship Peer-to-Peer Math and English tutoring program, to our Girls Leadership, Empowerment, and Action (LEAP) program, to our Level Up Village (LUV) classes, which focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM).


At Ejisu Model JHS we currently run a [LUV Global Doctors Anatomy](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-doctors-anatomy/) class. The students meet once a week after school to learn about human body systems in a hands-on and interactive way. Through this class, they use scalpels and forceps to dissect and learn, something they would not have the opportunity to do in a regular Ghanaian classroom. We are also running a [Global Inventors](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-inventors/) class, where they get to learn about 3D printing! The kids are also partnered with a school in another country that they exchange videos with to learn about each other's culture, while also sharing observations about their hands-on classes. 


If you'd like to help support our organization and important programs like these, please visit our donations page [here](http://www.exponentialeducationprogram.org/donate). A small amount can go a long way and any contribution would be greatly appreciated! None of our American staff take salaries and field staff like myself take small living stipends. All of your donations will go towards supporting our programs here on the ground.



I'd also be happy to send donors a thank-you card from the kids, Ghanaian chocolate, locally produced fabrics and crafts, etc. Just PM me your details so we can work out shipping.


If you are interested in learning about our other programs, check out our past AMAs and our various social media:

UPDATE 11/26 8:57 GMT: Thanks everyone for your interest! I have to sign off for now, but will get back to questions tomorrow. I will also try to get in touch with the kids for some more answers from them directly.

UPDATE 11/27 5:25 pm GMT: Hey guys, I'll take any last questions tonight. Thanks for your interest.

As a quick reminder, as some others have asked, you can find out more about supporting our organization and programs on our donate page.

"40+ guy with Kallmann syndrome - absent puberty and anosmia.


Just wanted to mention my medical condition. I am trying to raise awareness of the condition to help younger people get diagnosed and treated at an early age.

I have done an IAMA in the past as have a couple of other patients I know. 

I am happy to talk about the condition to anybody.

It is a genetic hormonal condition that causes puberty to fail to start and anosmia (lack of sense of smell). I have to be on life long testosterone replacement therapy. I am infertile unless I take specialised, expensive treatment. "
