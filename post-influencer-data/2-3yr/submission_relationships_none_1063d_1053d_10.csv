"UPDATE: I [19, M] was homeschooled, and think I am falling for my first real friend [20, M] at college.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53u1pj/i_19_m_was_homeschooled_and_think_i_am_falling/

Thank you all for your help and support with my first post. I had never had those types of conversations before. You all really helped me understand my feelings towards Gerad more clearly. 

I talked to Gerad the next day about my feelings. I told him first that I was confused about my sexuality. He was of course very awesome about this. His warmness with that helped me come out and admit my feelings for him. I told him that I had never had these kind of feelings for someone before, girl or guy, and that I was scared since he is my first major friend; I didn't want to hurt what we had. 

I know many people suggested that I not tell him the whole thing, but I saw a chance to get it all off of my chest, and I had to take it. He handled it well, and it didn't seem to have come as a surprise to him. He said that he didn't think it would be good for us at that point in our relationship, which did not feel great to hear, but was also a bit of a relief. He did hug me super close and tight. That was perfect. 

We did not talk about again until last Tuesday. Our school break has been the past week. I couldn't go home because of a hurricane and flooding, so I went with Gerad to him family's home. I am surprised my parents would let me stay at a friend's place over break, but they are busy with some flooding. I got to meet his family and friends, and we spent a lot of time alone together. He took me dancing Tuesday because I made him promise to get me out of my comfort zone. I had never been dancing before. He was extra flirty with me during the night, and we were very close all night. When we got back to his house he made a move and tried to sleep with me. This really freaked me out. 

I let him know that I had an amazing night, the best night of my life, but that I am totally not ready to have sex with anyone. Just the dancing and the kisses on the cheek we shared that night were the most intimate things I had ever done. He was really sorry for coming on so strong. I was worried that I ruined the night for him, but he assured me he still had a great night. We stayed up pretty late talking. He asked me to be his boyfriend, and let me know that we can go as slow as I need to. So, we are together now. I kissed him very quickly today, and it was the best thing ever. 

Also, everyone suggested that I look into therapy and I have had two appointments with a counselor at school. She is really helpful. Thank you for insisting on that. I think she will help me through some of my issues. 

I have not talked about this with my parents yet, and I don't plan to anytime soon. They will be cruel. I don't need that stress right now. 

TL/DR: I told my friend how I felt. We are dating now, which is wonderful. I am seeing a counselor at school.

"My [27F] mother [56F] wants me to take care of my grandma, who just had surgery. I'm recovering from my own surgery. We got into an argument and she sent an extremely hurtful text.


**NOTE: My mother and I usually get along well. However, she is probably the most passive-aggression person I've ever known and has a history of throwing me under the bus if it means helping someone else. She isn't a bad person, she's just not considerate of me sometimes. For example, my laptop which I use for work (graphic design) broke and I couldn't afford another one, and she knew that, and she knew I was struggling to save up for another; my uncle died and she took his new $1800 Macbook and gave it away to someone who just needed something basic for Facebook and job applications. Mom knows about laptops so it wasn't like she thought it was cheap.**


I had a mastectomy about two weeks ago (didn't actually have cancer, so chemo etc. isn't a factor in this). I'm still recovering and need to be taking it easy. Right now I'm trying to keep swelling at bay as I don't want yet another surgery and potential disfigurement, so I need to stay sedentary. I do go out for a couple of hours here and there, but I'm careful.

My grandma (66), who is my dad's mom and lives an hour away, had hand surgery today (repairing a trigger finger). My mother called me after and told me that my grandma needs help and needs someone to take care of her and basically do everything for her. My grandma is very independent, no signs of dementia or anything, and is an active person, so this was surprising to me and kind of came out of the blue. If I'd known recovery would be a big deal, I would've put surgery off until after she had recovered, but she decided to have it with almost no advance warning, and when I researched it to see if I did need to reschedule my surgery, it seemed like hers was pretty minor.

The problem is, Mom told me that she told my grandma I could take care of her (Mom and Dad work full-time, and I'm not working right now so I guess that was her logic, but I'm not working BECAUSE I JUST HAD SURGERY). I asked her why she would put me in that position and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I said she knows I'm recovering from my own surgery and she said I ""seemed fine""... I said I was, as long as I stayed home and kept ice on my chest and took it easy, and that she should've checked with me first. I pulled a childish move when she started berating me and hung up on her.

She texted me almost immediately and said, word for word: ""I guess Gram knows you better than I do! Maybe she thought you would ""feel pressured"" so didn't include you [in the group text] when asking for help. I didn't expect that at all!""

Needless to say I'm crushed. I would LOVE to take care of her, but I can't. Now I feel like everyone thinks I'm a selfish monster and am depressed to the point of feeling sick. I wrote back and told her not to talk to me right now, and I know she's going to call me when she gets out of work but I don't know what to say. :(
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I had a mastectomy two weeks ago and my grandma had a trigger finger repaired today. Mom told Gram I would take care of her. But I can't. I'm recovering from my own surgery. Mom sent a really mean text that crushed me and I don't know how to handle this.

 ---

UPDATE!!!!!

I just got off the phone with Gram!

She burst into laughter when I told her all the things Mom had said. Apparently Mom had been planning to ""surprise"" her with a $200 bidet because she was convinced Gram would have trouble cleaning herself. Gram said she found out about it accidentally and has been making fun of my mother since.

She said she doesn't need anything outside of opening fresh water bottles (she refuses to drink anything but Poland Springs) and said her neighbor already pre-loosened a bunch of them. Mom had talked to Gram's doctor and went worst-case-scenario, basically. Which is... typical, so I don't know why I didn't see that coming. Gram specifically said ""YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER. You know what she's like. Don't let her work you up. Jesus Christ, if I was going to have that much trouble I would've stayed in the goddamn hospital.""

She also said she didn't include me in the group text because I'm not a worrier and wouldn't be losing my shit wondering if she made it through surgery. She said she just updated Mom and my aunt (her daughter) and said she was fine, and that Mom was the one that went off about how she needed help. She also said ""for crying out loud, you just had surgery, you need to take care of yourself"" so she wasn't expecting me to help at all.

Gram said she'd love if we could talk more over the next few days since she'll be a little bored and asked if we could play Scrabble Online. All's good.

Now Gram and I have an inside joke about ""surprise bidets"" and I'm waiting for my mother to call in about an hour. I've gotten some awesome advice and really appreciate it; I have an idea of what to say now. (I don't want to ignore the call as that'll cause more problems. I KNOW she's going to call me, it's not a question lol)

"UPDATE: Boyfriend[23/M] has implied that he'd leave me[22/F] if I wouldn't stop playing my PS4...


Original post -- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/57h7wl/boyfriend23m_has_implied_that_hed_leave_me22f_if/

We made up.

Not.

He came back home drunk at like 4AM, and I had a few things gathered together as I decided that I'm going to be staying at my parents for a while and sort things out like rent etc. Before I left for my parents he apologised in the morning at like 10AM (took the day off work because of it) , but didn't apologise for 'calling me out on my addiction.' And 'Just telling me to quit my boy habits'.

I was baffled and I asked what it is he want from this relationship (Because I was under the impression he wanted me to break up with him), and he said for me to listen to him and basically do what he says, so I told him I am listening to him, and that I didn't like what I was listening to. 

So I told him he was being sexist pig, made points of saying how often I play my PS4 and that he can use it more than me. I then rounded it up by telling him to go f*** himself and that we were done (not the most gracious thing to do, but it got the message across.) 

I'm sitting in my old bedroom receiving mixed text messages from, between ""I'm sorry baby please come back."" and ""Stop being such a b****"" You get the point reddit, I don't need that, nor deserve it. I'm a mixture of emotions, but hey -- At least I can romance MacCready or Danse on FO4. Haha.

TLDR; broke up with him, told him he was being a sexist pig and I'm at my parents, currently romancing MacCready/Danse on FO4 (Ha)."

"UPDATE - Me (24F) with my housemate (22F) and her boyfriend (24M), I caught him hitting her last year, she wont stop bringing him into the house even though I've asked her not to


Original - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/525kd1/me_24f_with_my_housemate_22f_and_her_boyfriend/ 

Hi guys! Before I update I just wanted to say a huge thanks to everyone who commented, all the opinions did help and you're all a great bunch of lads altogether. In particular I wanted to thank /u/myassholealt - I know I didn't reply on the original (I had 4,000 assignments due) but your comment really made me think about what we were doing to isolate Ashley so thank you for making me come to my senses! 

Now. I spent a day or two after posting talking with Maria and Peter, showing them this post and the comments and we all kind of came to the conclusion that the way we were acting (justified or not) really wasn't helping anybody. We were getting angry, Ashley was getting upset and Charlie was getting off on us being uncomfortable. We decided that the best course of action was for me to have one more heart to heart with Ashley, and then put it to rest and just ignore Charlie as much as possible, and be civil if we absolutely had to talk to him.

The heart to heart didn't go too well. I sat her down and just told her that we all loved her, we wanted her to be happy and safe over everything else, and we'd prefer if Charlie wasn't around as much because we truly could not forgive him for hurting her the way he did, but I also said I understood that we can't force her to break up with him and that she has every right to have him here. I asked her to think it over and just consider how she'd feel if this had been me in her situation and her in mine, and that we weren't trying to break them up out of spite, just that we were genuinely afraid that she'd get hurt again. I cried the whole way through this convo haha but she was just made of stone, said thanks, and told me to leave her be, so I did. 

After that we just acted as we normally would every time we saw Charlie! He still came to the house every fucking day, but we'd ask her every day how her day went, have a laugh and just talked a load of shite basically. This is the way we'd normally interact, and after a week or two she started warming up to us and cracking a few jokes again, it was fabulous to see. We'd answer him if he specifically spoke to one of us but apart from that didn't really pay him any mind at all. He stopped doing the weird smug smile because we started doing it back to him, so he just looked pissed off all the time instead. He'd stay at the house most nights and I took the advice from another poster and locked my door every night, just in case. 

Last Tuesday, it all came to a head. Myself, Peter and Maria went to the cinema, we invited Ashley but she declined as she had plans with Charlie. When we came home the door was wide open, all the lights were on and there was a hole in the sitting room wall. We found Ashley upstairs bawling. When we were out Charlie had confronted her about us - saying we were trying to make them break up and that we were trying to poison her against him. She defended us saying that we hadn't said a word against him and that we were being really nice to them again. He flipped out basically, screamed at her, threatened to hit her again, punched a hole in the wall, called her a few choice names and left. She went upstairs and locked herself in her room because she was terrified he'd come back. He sent her a tonne of disgusting messages and left a few voicemails. She agreed to blocking his number and deleted him off facebook. 

Unfortunately he had a copy of the house key so we had an awkward day explaining to our landlord why we needed the locks changed, but he didn't mind too much as long as we paid for it and didn't give any more copies of the key to anybody.
 
It's only been a week since all of this went down so I'm not 100% about the outcome long term, she says she's done with him but she said the same thing last time so we're just gonna keep an eye on it. He hasn't come back to the house yet but we're all a bit worried that at some point he will, so we're keeping all the windows locked and we don't want Ashley on her own in the house as much as possible for the time being. She's agreed to go to counselling and she's going away with her mother to London for the long weekend on Friday for a break.

Thanks to all of you again for your advice! Sometimes doing nothing is actually the best thing to do haha. 

TL;DR: Ignored the problem, problem threatened housemate and damaged the property, problem went away (hopefully for good) "

"I [21F] will soon be requesting my childhood CPS records from my home state, I want closure from my Mom [41F] and Grandma [60F], as they both deny any abuse ever occurred


From the time I was five years old to about twelve years old, I lived in an emotionally and physically abusive household. My Mom worked all the time and left me home with her husband, who would beat me and scream at me and throw me down stairs almost every day when I came home from school. 

CPS had successfully gotten involved after the first incident, but after seeing what happened to my mom (mentally and physically) when the state put a restraining order on my abuser, I (a kindergartner at the time) felt responsible and decided that I would lie whenever a CPS worker visited my house to check on me. I was afraid of what would happen to my mom, and I was afraid to go into foster care after all of the horrible things she had told me about it.

Over the course of the next five years, I would be visited by multiple social workers, begin counselling for depression at school, and be subjected to social isolation when not in school- although the bullying at school by teachers and other students was also pretty bad.

Mom and my abuser ended up divorcing when I was twelvish and I recall talking to my mom in the car some months later after their separation and saying, ""gee whiz mom I'm so happy I don't get have to worry about getting beat every time I come home from school.” To which my mom replied, ""what are you talking about that never happened."" From then on my depression came on full throttle and I think I tried to self medicate as best I could with drugs and alcohol. This led me into loads of other dangerous encounters with sexual violence, but I won't go into that here.

Anyways, I think that I still struggle with depression and anxiety because I've never actually received acknowledgement from anyone in my family that I was ever abused. Whenever the topic is brought up, I'm told a different story about how my memory of events is incorrect and I probably misremember because I was so young.
  ---   
  TL;DR I will soon be requesting my childhood records from child protective services. My intention is to sit down with members of my family and go through them so that I can hopefully receive the closure I need to move on and stop letting it affect me.

"My coworker (50s F) accidentally just sent me everyone at my company's salaries. I (26 F) am extremely underpaid.


Hi Reddit,


Looking for some advice on this. I work at a very small company and I have been here the last 4 years. It was my first job out of college, so when I accepted the position I accepted it at a pretty low rate. Since then, I've gotten incremental increases every year of $5000. My job requires a lot of specialized knowledge that I didn't have when I started, but now I feel pretty knowledagble and I feel as though I am an asset to my company.


Anyway, I sort of had an idea that I was being underpaid and that I should renegotiate with my boss on salary since I am no longer an inexperienced employee. However, I had no idea how far off I was. 


Today, the accountant at my company accidentally sent me a list of everyone's salaries at my company. It was supposed to go to her boss. Huuuuge fuck up, as you may imagine.  Anyway, I initially thought the email was to me so I opened it and saw it. No one else was copied on the email. I responded to her and let her know that I thought she had sent this to the wrong person. She emailed me back and said to delete it (which I've done...) but it was already too late.


What I saw made me cringe.  4 people have the same position as I do and make $30k - $50k more than I do. 3 of those started before me (2-3 years) and 1 started 2 years after me. I also think it's important to note that they are all much older than me. They are all in their 40s - 50s. So even though they haven't been at this company that much longer than me (or not as long in the one case), they have had longer work experience total... which I get. BUT... our work is exactly the same so I feel like the discrepancy shouldn't be THAT significant.  


Anyway... I'm pretty sure no one except the accountant knows that I saw this. I doubt she would tell her boss because she could be in big trouble for it. So....  is it normal to have this big of salary discrepancy with people that are older than me? Do I tell my boss I saw this? I'm thinking definitely not but just that I should ask my boss for a raise and bring him ""research"" online that I did for people with my position in our area. I've googled it before and the salary online shows it should be in line with what the others are being paid.


HELP! 

TL;DR: I accidentally just found out that everyone with my position at my company gets paid way better than I do. What do I do?

"My [23F] boyfriend [25M] was tagged in a pic on instagram with another girl and now won't show me his phone?


My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and everything has been pretty good up until this point. 

I was looking at his instagram tagged pictures and I saw that there was one from like a week ago where he's standing behind this other girl for a mirror selfie pressed against her with his hands through her belt loops. I showed it to him and asked him about it and he said she just wanted to look like she was in a relationship with him because another guy way creeping on her, and he said I could ask her and she would confirm it. Then I asked if I could go on his phone to get her number and he said no and that he would get it for me, but since then he hasn't let me see his phone at all and changed the passcode on it. And he still hasn't given me her number to text her to ask about it. 

I've stopped pressing the issue because I think he could just tell her to lie and use the same story so texting her would be kind of pointless but does it sound like I'm getting played? Should I get her number anyways? I'm not sure what to do in this situation and would really appreciate any advice.

"My sister's [26F] husband [34M] admitted to having feelings for me [26F]. Family get-togethers have gotten very uncomfortable.


My sister got married 4 years ago. Her husband, Dan, is not the best guy in my opinion. My parents aren't too fond of him, either. He's not abusive as far as we can tell, but he's just not a good guy. He's rude, he doesn't treat my sister with much respect. She's pregnant right now and he's constantly making ""jokes"" about how as soon as the kid is born he'll be heading to the bar every night, he won't change a single diaper, just call him when the kid is old enough to talk. Just super funny stuff, obviously.

Which isn't to say my sister is a helpless victim. She knew what he was like before she married him. And she listened to my parents, me, our brother, several friends all tell her that they didn't think it was for the best. Plus she's just such a pushover. She lets him do whatever the hell he wants and just goes with it. And they make horrible decisions. He cheated on her about a year in. So she cheated on him to get back at him. I honestly don't know what happened. My parents have one of the most respectable, loving relationships I've ever seen. And my brother and his wife are just amazing together. But I still love her. She's my twin sister. And outside of her relationship she's an amazing, smart, funny, insightful, beautiful woman.

But here's my problem. About 3 months ago, her husband admitted he was attracted to me and would pursue me if he wasn't married. He didn't tell me this, he told my sister. And of course she came bawling to me about it. Did she dump him? No, of course not. She decided she was fine with it since I would never sleep with him or anything. I told her I didn't support that decision, but whatever. She did it anyway.

In the last 3 months, every time I've seen him, it's incredibly fucking awkward. My sister and I live in the same apartment building, so that's pretty often. And our brother lives not far away, so we all get together with our SOs often. We want our sister there, and her husband is part of the deal, so he's always there, too. Plus we see our parents about once a month for dinner. My family is very close and always has been. About a month ago he got super drunk and started flirting with me very heavily. I shut it down and told my sister...her reaction consisted of scolding him and then dropping it. I just hate being in the same room as someone who is so despicable. 

I don't know what to do. I love my sister and don't want to cut her out of my life. But I can't deal with her husband. But if she comes somewhere, he comes, too. Uninviting him would drive her away, which I don't want. Does anyone have any advice that I'm missing here? I have no idea how to handle this.

"My (24F) boyfriend's (27M) crazy ex (29F) moved next door to us and won't leave us alone. It's affecting our relationship and I don't know what to do.


- A more accurate description of the situation can be found in my other posts, for reference -

Hey there. So my boyfriend (Chris) and I have been together for 2+ years. Everything is really great, besides this issue. Basically, his crazy ex stalked us and moved in next door to us and will not leave us alone. She's done it all - contacted us from 5 (or 6, I can't remember at this point) different phone numbers, violent threats, threats to break into our home and steal our dog, faked a pregnancy ... just batshit insane. We have a rather large and detailed Google doc that has every contact from her documented. She's reached out to Chris' friends, his mom, me, has threatened to sue and hurt us, it's crazy. So we filed a restraining order as soon as we could. 

We recently had our court date and it was granted, for obvious reasons. She is now claiming that the ""harassment"" (we haven't reached out to her once - she's sent me 300+ Facebook messages from a new profile because I blocked her other one) of us filing a restraining order against us has caused her to miscarry (she was never pregnant and is apparently addicted to drugs) and that she's going to sue us. Basically the whole thing is insane, I'm exhausted by having to constantly leave work early to file police reports from her violating the order and threatening us, not getting sleep because she has threatened to harm us, and just worrying about our safety and well being.

Chris has been pretty great throughout the whole ordeal. He feels awful because although it isn't his fault (he didn't prompt her or stay friends with her or anything), he's the one who dated her, not me. I'm having a really hard time with the whole situation because it's been really stressful. I've never dealt with anything like this - even though Chris dated her, he's the last person in the world I would expect to have a psycho ex. But she's relentless on tearing us apart and I hate to admit that it's kind of working.

Although it's unfair, I'm harboring a little resentment toward him. He's been extremely honest and upfront about everything - she's claimed he's cheated on me with her, that they were still hooking up when we were dating - and although he can't technically prove it's NOT true, I do believe him, especially because it's hard to take the word of a crazy person. But at the same time, she's put so many horrible thoughts into my head and caused so much drama, I can't help but get angry sometimes. Like when I walk out to my car to go to work in the morning and get screamed at - it's a bummer.

The police have been NO help, because even though she's violated the order more than once, they keep coming up with bull shit reasons to not arrest her, such as her having so many different numbers, we can't PROVE it's really her harassing us, and the fact that she's yelling at me from inside her house, doesn't mean she's yelling at me, but could just be ranting inside her house (even though she addressed me by name). He finally changed his number so it's gotten a little bit better, but she's still unstable and has been having other people contact us for her.

"My sister [29 F] is planning on abandoning my two nieces [8 and 3 F] to start a new family.


Hi, I need some advice. My sister was in a relationship with her boyfriend [31 M] for about 10 years. She had two daughters with him and she was very close with them, and by all accounts a good mother. Her and her boyfriend fought a bit though. 


She got weight loss surgery about a year ago and suddenly changed. She immediately cheated and broke up with her boyfriend and began ""seeing"" someone halfway across the country. She lives with my parents with my two nieces and during the past year she started flying out there to see him, trying to get pregnate and apparently had a miscarriage, which we all just found out about. 


She has been neglecting my nieces for awhile now. Staying in her room and talking for hours with this guy. A couple weeks ago my older niece broke her pinky at school playing tetherball. And during the visit to the doctor she told my niece that she is now moving out to live with the guy and start a new family. My family is stunned. 


I live four hours away so I don't know all the details but apparently she kept most of this hidden from my family. My parents willingly watched and cared for my nieces. Her boyfriend gets them half the week and my family gets them the other half. I'm [27 M] extremely close to both of my nieces and came down to visit them because of all that is happening. My family and her boyfriend will apparently take care of my nieces. I'm at a loss of what to do or what to say to my nieces. Everyone is extremely upset and a few of us are done with my sister and want nothing to do with her ever again. She's planning on leaving in about five or six months. 

I don't think there is anything to do but does anyone have advice on how to deal with this situation? It's a mindf*ck. I'm seeing my niece later today. Does anyone know what I can say to her to make her feel better and to help?

"Making my(27f) husband(33m) choose between his ""hobby"" and me.


My husband of 3 years, together 8+ years, has spent the last 2 years pursuing a (rap) music career. We have 2 boys, 8y and 5y. At first it started casual, Tuesday's at a friends just messing around in the studio, and has escalated to him actively trying to make this his career,  building a studio in our basement and having up to 5-6 guys here daily (usually only half bother to show) ""working on music"" (usually just partying in the basement although I know my husband is trying to do more than party). 

He's gone through 3 groups of artists in 2 years, built 4 studios in various peoples houses which he lost access to after the groups fell apart, he's had 1 small show in which half his partners forgot their words, and 3 or 4 cancelled shows. We've financed everything alone from all these studios to CDs to liquor and snacks everyday and had my electic bills ran up since sometimes people are here for literally 12 hours, my house shaking with repetitive beats. Our finances are joint and, truthfully I bring in more money. So, basically I'm financing most of it. 

I've been unbelievably supportive. From helping promote to dealing with his adding every girl in a bikini on  facebook to ""promote"" his music to, to paying out so much money and never making a single dime back or getting a dime of financial help from his partners, to spending long nights in studios with him just so we could still be with eachother, to now losing him every second of the day except maybe an hour late at night to the studio.  

He still seems to think that this money and time suck is going to make him a millionaire someday despite his being a 33 year old white guy. I've tried talking to him and compromising a million times and I've finally admitted to myself that I can't live this life. I've decided he has to choose between me and his music. I feel so guilty for considering an ultimatum, but at this point we want drastically different things in life. He wanted to settle down and have kids and so we did, and i'm focused on mothering and adulting. Then a year after marriage he decided to become a rapper. If this is what's most important to him, he should be able to choose that and eventually find a woman who wants to live that way. I don't,  I've tried and I'm now a miserable snappy person because I'm alone all the time because I don't want to go party in the freaking basement like I'm 17. 

 It's not like he doesn't have other hobbies. Its not like we didn't have career plans. But instead of trying to write a book or open a restaurant like we planned, he delivers pizza and raps. I bartend because it gives me the most time at home with the best income, but now that both kids are in school we had always planned to get day jobs and frankly I want to be able to retire someday. I need a ""real job"" for that and so does he. 

Anyways, I know this was a novel. My question is, is this wrong for me to make him choose? I'm against ultimatums. They're not healthy. But I feel like he has to choose. Choose music and seperate and live our seperate lives, or choose me and hang up his mic for good. I feel like a rotten wife but also know at this point neither of us can be happy with this arrangement. 



Tl;dr: husband wants to be a famous rapper, spends all his time and our money trying to make it happen, I want him to quit it or I'm out. Feel bad for planning to give him an ultimatum, but it I don't,  divorce is inevitable anyways."

"I (58/f) found out my son-in-law (30/m) gave my grandson (6mths/m) a name my late daughter (28/f) did not want


I just found this out and I'm devastated, I often browse reddit but I don't post often so I'm sorry if this doesn't meet the rules of this subreddit.

My daughter, Becky died 9 hours after her son Tommy was born.  It was a pulmonary embolism.  She had been on bed rest for the last 2 months of her pregnancy, which they believe caused her to develop deep vein thrombosis.  It was completely unexpected, she was otherwise healthy.  This was a wanted pregnancy that she and her husband Tom wanted very much.  The only silver lining is that Tommy is a wonderful, happy, healthy baby but two families are broken and we are all doing our best to hold ourselves together for Tommy.

Becky and Tom didn't tell anyone what the sex of the baby was when she was pregnant and they didn't tell anyone any names they were thinking about.  Becky did tell me once that she and Tom were having a hard time agreeing on the name, but she never mentioned the name to me.  Then, a week before she died, she told me that they had decided on a name.  She said that she didn't want to tell me because they agreed to keep it a secret until the baby was here but that she knew it would make me happy. Becky died before she could tell anyone what they had named the baby.  Tom told us the baby was named Thomas Jr.  I thought it was a fine name and didn't think much about Becky's comment until later.

I have been coming over regularly to help Tom with the baby and I thought I had a very good relationship with Tom.  Tom has said many times that he wants Tommy to have a close relationship with my family since that's the only connection Tommy will have to his mother.


A month ago, Tom gave me a box of Becky's things that he thought I might like to have.  I was very grateful but couldn't look at them right away.  Last night I opened the box and he had included some of Becky's journals.  I read through them and was planning to give them back to Tom for Tommy, so Tommy could read about his mom's life when he gets older.  I was reading through the journal she kept when she was pregnant with Tommy.  In it, she talked about how hard it was for her and Tom to agree on a name.  Once they found out they were having a boy, Tom was insistent that the baby was Thomas Jr. Becky wrote that she didn't like the idea and that they fought a lot.  Becky wrote that they compromised on a name: Henry (my late father's name and a family name dating back a long time) James (Tom's late grandfather's name).  She even wrote that she had ordered some things for the nursery with that monogram.

I don't even know what to feel.  Tom ignored my daughter and his wife's wishes right after her death.  He took away a connection that Tommy could have had to his mother's family. While I will always love Tommy, I don't want anything to do with Tom right now but I need to have a relationship with him to have a relationship with Tommy.  I wonder what he did with the things that Becky bought for her son.  I haven't seen them in Tommy's nursery.  That means Tom threw away things that Tommy could have kept, knowing his mother bought them for him with him in mind.

I want Tommy to have Becky's journals.  My pan was to copy a few passages for myself and give the originals back to Tom. Now, i'm wondering if I should keep them and give them to Tommy myself when he's older.

How to I forgive my son-in-law for disrespecting my late daughter's wish?  What do I do with the journals?  Should I confront Tom about what he's done?


tl;dr- my son-in law disrespected my late daughter's wishes about the name of their child.  What do I do?"

"I [22F] was angrily confronted about ruining an ex fling's (27M) marriage that I never knew existed.


For backstory, back during March/April of this year, I had a brief fling with a casual friend-of-friend (who we'll call Marcus) through co workers. Marcus was a really nice guy and very good looking, and after a pretty rough breakup he was a really good rebound for me. 

VERY early on, he told me about how he had gotten a girlfriend pregnant not too long ago, (Shelby) and they had a daughter together (under the age of 3). He told me he and Shelby had gotten married immediately when she was pregnant, but she eventually confessed to him after their daughter was born she was not attracted to men and was a lesbian, and ended up moving overseas to be with family. He told me they had not divorced, as this would make it easier for him to send money and visit, and I never disputed because I'm 22 years old and know nothing about those sort of legal issues. Multiple coworkers (and best friend Rachel, who is also a coworker) who also had known him for much longer than myself, told me this also was true, so I never doubted it.

Around the end of June things with Marcus and I fizzled out, as I knew he and I would never be serious and I met my current boyfriend (Sean). At that point, Marcus and I stopped communicating (whether it be social media, or messaging). I had found out from coworkers during the middle of July, that he had starting dating another mutual friend of ours (Sarah, who I am close to and like,) and at that point I even went out with our group of friends including Marcus and Sarah together. There has never been an issue.

Last week, Rachel told me that Shelby had arrived back in the country from overseas, and out of respect for his family situation he had chosen to end things with Sarah. I didn't think anything of it, until today during the first 5 minutes of my work day, I received the angriest text message I've ever read in my life. 

I don't want to be too specific but it was so ridiculous, that for the first paragraph I assumed it was a text message to the wrong number and I laughed out loud. The unidentified woman called me a whore, told me I hoped I was happy that I ruined a family and a marriage, and a proceeded to call me horrible names. 

I 100% thought this was a text to the wrong person until I read ""and in case you're fucking too many other married men, this is Marcus's wife."" That's when it all clicked in to me that he had obviously lied about his relationship status. I still have no idea how she knows who I am, or how she found me. I spoke to Rachel, and as far as we both know, Sarah has not gotten the same message.

Now I'm just wondering how to go from here. Do I call her or text her and tell her my point of view? She was extremely angry in the message and not seemingly open to ANY sort of conversation or understanding or even wanting to know my point of view. Do I try? And I guess my next question is, if the answer is ""don't try"" how do I gain closure from this? My own parents divorced when my father cheated on my mother, and feeling like I just caused this exact pain on someone else is killing me. 

Also, to married people, would you even want to know your spouse lied and said you were gay and left the country? Would it be enough to know they cheated and move on, without knowing the horrible things they said?

Thanks everyone in advance.

"My [27F] parents [57M and 60F] let my uncle [50sM], who sexually assaulted me at 15, live with them and didn't tell me until after I bought a plane ticket to go see them.


My uncle molested me for 6 months when I was 15, when he tried to rape me unsuccessfully for the umpteenth time, I had finally had enough and reported him and he went to prison for 3 years.  I moved to another state in 2010 to get away from my parents. My father was very abusive growing up, and as soon as I had an out, I left home and never went back.  

My relationship with my parents improved over the 6 years I've been gone. I decided this year that I would go back to see them because it's been so long.  I bought the ticket. We had discussed the possibility of me visiting them in December, and, finally having enough money to see them, I decided to buy the ticket.

I call them up really happy and excited to finally see my family (parents, grandmother, sister, cousins, etc), and my dad tells me, ""oh, by the way, I let my brother live with us."" I asked which one, afraid of the answer, and sure enough, they've let my sexual predator of an uncle live with them.

I'm so devastated and feel absolutely betrayed. I don't know what to do. I can't believe this is happening.

They tell me it's because he's a born again Christian and has changed his ways, but this guy just got out of prison this month after spending 2 years there for possession of drugs and attacking someone with a knife.  He got out for good behavior.  My parents are super religious, and they're big believers in forgiveness, but this... This is too much.

I know know know it's because he's paying them money to live with them. My parents are both on disability, but live beyond their means and are addicted to prescription opioids.  They used to steal from me and my sister and threaten to throw us out if we didn't give them money. They'll pretend to be in more pain than they are, and get even more drugs than they need, and then sell the excess to support their extravagant lifestyle.

I'm mad that they haven't changed since I left, and they misled me into thinking they had, and that I believed them. I'm devastated that they would let someone who hurt me so badly live with them.  I tried to kill myself 3 months later at 15 because of all the pain and because of the way my family treated me afterwards.  I just can't even deal right now. 

TL;DR: parents let my piece of shit uncle who sexually assaulted me live with them because he's a born again Christian but didn't tell me about it until after I had bought a ticket to go see them. How should I proceed from here?

Edit: I'm very overwhelmed by the level of support you guys have shown me.  I don't want to visit them, but I still want to see my homestate and have fun with friends and relatives and my former foster mother. I'll update you all in December."
"Pregnant (f/29) and my boyfriend (m/27) and his family aren't compassionate to my morning sickness


I'm 11 weeks pregnant and like the title says, my boyfriend takes my morning sickness personally. I am nauseous all day and have been so exhausted I sleep most of the time I'm not at work. I finally got a prescription for the nausea and while it takes the edge of, it makes me incredibly drowsy and I still feel sick. In the last week, my nausea/drowsiness has caused me to miss 2 of his dinners with his family. The first time he sent me a text while he was at dinner asking if I hated his family. The second time, his mom said she thinks I don't like her and I'm avoiding dinners because of her.

I have explained my sickness to my boyfriend and he lives with me so he sees me unable to eat or my face after I've thrown up. I told him it has nothing to do with them and I personally think it's pretty inconsiderate and lacking compassion to make my sickness about them. I want to feel well again! They think I'm exaggerating or being too weak that I'm letting it control my life but it really is in control of my life right now. I've had some complications already with this pregnancy and stressing about their feelings and opinions of me makes me feel even worse. What do I do?

tl;dr: Boyfriend and his family are making my morning sickness about them and think I'm using it as an excuse to not be around them. It's not about them, I am so sick and don't know what to say or do about that."

"Me [28F] with my friend [26F] 5 years - walking on eggshells after having babies and getting sick of it


My friend ""Leigh"" and I had our kids very close together early this year, less than one month apart.  Both babies are totally healthy and growing like weeds.  I love being a mom and while I do look forward to going back to work eventually, for the most part I'm just enjoying myself puttering around the house and playing with my kid whilst on parental leave.

I have a million hobbies and I live for picking up new skills.  I speak 3 languages, go back to school every few years to further my career/enhance my skill sets and really enjoy creating stuff in general - I'm very driven and just like learning new things.  Several times in the past I've gotten weird comments like ""is there anything you *can't* do?"" (trust me, there's lots) so I'm very conscious of not bragging or showing off.  That being said, I do have albums on Facebook of my projects/art because I am proud of the things I make sometimes.  I do lots of creative stuff on the side even when I am working, so this extra time off has really given me the opportunity to work piecemeal on some larger projects (think sewing, painting etc - I'm like a low-rent Christine McConnell, haha).

My main problem is that Leigh, whose self-esteem is at like -9000 keeps comparing our lives/kids and has decided that mine is better and is vocally jealous.  Comments have escalated from fishing for compliments like ""I'm probably not going to be as good a mom as you"" to her straight up, repeatedly saying I make her feel inadequate.

She also fixates on how the kids compare to each other, going so far as calling her baby ""a monster"" ""shitty"" and ""garbage"" while mine is ""ideal"" and ""the smart one"" (ffs they're under 1 yr old, my baby is a happy lump that blows spit bubbles, smiles and gums on her hands.). Her husband also makes disparaging comments comparing the two kids but tries to play it off like a joke - she's not.

I have been supportive through all of this because I know how hard it really is.  Having a baby is less sunshine and rainbows than it is shitty diapers and sleep deprivation.  No matter how much I tried to reassure her, the comments weren't stopping so I took a firmer line and said straight up that she needed to stop saying things like that, that it's hard not to compare babies so close in age but it really wasn't productive and I was very uncomfortable with it.  She said she'd stop but of course that hasn't happened.

So now I feel like I can't talk to her about my kid without feeling guilty that she's comparing them, I can't talk to her about daily life without a comment of ""you're so much better than me""... I've just started to fade away and say I'm busy all the time.  Which isn't a lie, I have lots on my plate - but now the ""I had to go make other friends because I was going stir crazy since you're so buuuuuusy"" has started and I'm just so sick of all the guilt trips.

So what the heck do I do?  I turn down invitations to go to group hangout or classes because even being in public doesn't make her tone it down (at a drink &amp; paint nite she said ""why do I even bother, yours makes mine look like shit"" over and over to the point where other people started reassuring her).  The negativity and oh-poor-me attitude is just so draining and intensely uncomfortable, but I would feel bad about walking away from a friendship when she's clearly not having an easy time. 

TL;DR - I don't want to be friends with someone who consistently makes me feel bad about having a normal happy baby and a few hobbies outside of being a mom...  But our social group is pretty closely knit and I'd feel like a jerk for walking away when she's having a tough time."

"My (28F) fiance (28M) wants his ex's daughter as our flower girl (5F)


I know posts involving children can be controversial, but please hear me out.

My fiance, Corey, and I are getting married next June. We have been together two years, engaged for four months. When we met he had recently gotten out of a six year relationship, on and off. They were living together and also engaged. During one of their ""off"" times, his ex got pregnant by someone else. They called off the engagement and he moved out. They broke up for a while after that. Eventually they got back together, but they still called off the wedding and he never moved back in.  He would help out with her daughter, Nia, but Nia's father is fairly active in her life and Corey never thought he was the actual father. 

Corey does not keep in contact with Nia or her mother. In fact, I have only met the ex twice. I am familiar with Nia only because my son attends the same school as her. Nia was only two when Corey and her mom split. She knows Corey, but doesn't have a strong relationship with him. From what Corey has told me, he really only bonded with Nia when he would go to visit his ex. He did not support or provide for them. 

So, imagine my suprise when he told me last week he wanted Nia to be our flower girl. Conversation went something like this:

Me: ""I hope Destiney (my niece) comes out of her shell a bit before the wedding. She would be the cutest flower girl""

Corey: ""I thought Nia could be the flower girl""

Me: ""Your ex's daughter? Why would she be in our wedding?""

Corey: ""She has been a part of my life. It's my wedding too""

Me: ""I think thats weird. You didnt take care of her and you're not related. We have so many family members that could be a part of our wedding. We didn't even discuss inviting them""

Corey: ""I think its a kind gesture. I used to be engaged to ex. I have no ill feelings toward her or Nia. We have no reason to exclude them""

We went on and on about this. He has been in my nieces life since she was born and she is literally a part of our family. He also has nieces that he didn't suggest be a part of the ceremony. I have no problem with Nia. She is a beautiful little girl. I even told him we could invite them since he felt so strongly, but he really wants her to be the flower girl. I even thought for a minute that she may actually be his child and thats why he was so upset, but Nia is her fathers twin. 

I also thought that maybe he was just being left out of the planning, so I made sure to never make decisions without him and to have him do some planning as well. However, he was not interested in doing any of the actual leg work. 

I am totally blindsided by this. I honestly would be weirded out by the whole thing. Even if we had more than one flower girl, it would still be strange to have my husbands ex-girlfriends daughter in our wedding. I don't want to look back on pictures and be reminded of his past relationship.

Am I being insensitive? Am I minimizing the role he played in Nia's life?

***TL;DR: Fiance wants his ex-girlfriends daughter to be our flower girl even though he didn't raise her. 


EDIT: Corey loves children. He loves my son and has a good relationship with him. I have considered that he may be jealous of my son's relationship with his dad and that's maybe why he wants Nia in the wedding. My sons dad takes him to school daily and makes his lunch, he moved closer to me when I moved last year so he can continue to be actively involved and his family is also very a part of our sons life. Nia's dad lives out of state. I dont know exactly what their relationship is like, but I know he has other children that he lives with.

"[23 M] with my [24 F] for six years, I can't tell my girlfriend that I'm upset because she just gets more upset in response.


Hello, I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a while and I've always found it really hard to talk to my girlfriend about my problems or things that are bothering me. 

FYI she has anxiety problems and she's finally seeing someone about but hasn't seen much improvement from my perspective. 

Basically, if I say ""You've done X and it bothered me because Y."" she gets upset at herself for getting me upset. Then she gets anxious about how I'm going to leave her. Then these emotions swell into her crying or having some kind of panic attack. Then me being upset turns into me comforting her because she's so upset. And the worst part is that she knows she does this, she acknowledges it and that makes her even more upset. I just don't see a solution here.  

I don't know what to do because it feels like I can never tell her how I'm feeling without her having extreme reactions. So I just keep things bottled up and then that's not healthy.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Can't get upset at girlfriend without her getting more upset in response. Don't know what to do.

**Conclusion:**
Alright, I think I've caught up on all of the comments. I'm sorry if I didn't reply to you directly but I can promise you I've read and considered every one.

I think the main points I'm taking away are: less time spent consoling, more solo time for her, scheduling a couples session with her therapist so that I can try to get more/better exercises for her, and more time spent on fixing myself. I know a popular opinion is that I need to end the relationship but I really do love her and I think that fixing the relationship would be worth it. I'll be giving it another few months trying to apply some of the advice you guys have given me. If things still aren't working out then a break will be in order.

I have removed the edit because this has gotten rather popular and I don't want her to stumble on it. The rant gave away too much information.

I also want to leave a thank you for all of the comments. A big part of the stress involved with this is thinking that I've gone crazy. You begin knowing what's normal and what's not but over time that line blurs. You start to doubt that it isn't normal behavior. So I just wanted to say thanks for the support.

I'll continue to check in and read any additional comments but I think my mind is pretty much set on how to proceed."
"[UPDATE] Me [16 M] with my long-time crush and friend [17 F] having difficulties understanding if what we do is flirting

So before all the deets, I wanna thank everyone who responded, you are al very saintly folk here I can tell you that.

Well after all the encouragement you guys gave me, I went to the football game Friday night. After half time, we were swamped at the concession stand, but my sister let me go to talk to Laci anyway. We talked and talked and talked like we usually do, but before she had to go, I said, ""Laci, we've been friends for a long time,"", trailing off, biting back fear. ""But lately I've been wondering if we could be more than friends?""

She said yes. We hugged and she ran off, meanwhile I was doing a quadruple take. We talked over text later that night, and decided to keep it on the dl.

Today the band and music boosters (that's me) went to play at Cedar Point, and I got to hang out with her all day. It was great, it's just like before except even better now. We went into haunted houses, rode the ferris wheel (wherein I nearly pissed myself out of fear lol), and had a great day. I have never felt so connected to another person in my whole life. I really understand what my parents mean now; that the best relationships are just like friendships, only closer.

Thank you all so much for the best weekend of my life :) (And hopefully many more like it)

"Me [26F] with my Fiance [26M] of 5 years, I feel crazy for considering ending our engagement over chores


I would like to begin by saying that I love my fiance very very much. He is kind, patient, hilariously funny, fun, level-headed, and a great friend (to me and to all of his friends). We have known each other for 7+ years and were great friends for a year and a half before we started dating.


We were long-distance for three years while I was in grad school in another state. Soon after graduating and passing my licensing exams last fall, I secured a job in his city (also where we went to undergrad--our plan was always for me to come back here). He was living with a roommate and I moved into my fiance's room, with the approval of his roommate and my share of the rent/utilities, of course. It's not as if I was stunned by fiance's inability to keep house when I moved in--I saw his apartment when I would visit for weekends during grad school. However, during our long distance time, he always made sure to pick up before I arrived for a weekend, and would take care of a chore (taking out the trash if it smelled, cleaning the bathroom so I could use it) right away if I asked him. 


So, I live with him and the roommate and the two of us are working full-time through spring of this year. Unfortunately, I lost my job this spring and was without consistent employment for a few months (I did do temp work as much as I could). During these few months, I did my best to keep busy with job applications and interviews, but when I had spare time I spent it cleaning the apartment. I had to temporarily reduce my rent/utilities contributions so I thought it was only fair to make up for that with taking over the lion's share of the chores (plus I was home most of the day, so it made sense). During my unemployment, my fiance and I got engaged and then a few weeks later, moved out of the apartment with the roommate and into our own, first-ever just the two of us apartment. I was very excited.


Shortly after our move, I got a good, permanent, job offer and accepted it. As it stands now, I commute 40-60 minutes one way depending on traffic, and my fiance commutes 45-90 minutes depending on traffic (it is not unusual for him to spend and hour and a half in the car on the way home). 


So, the problem now, and the point of this post, is that I feel like I have no help with household chores. He will leave dishes in the sink for days at a time (we have no dishwasher so they all have to be done by hand). Sweeping/vacuuming/mopping just does not occur to him, even if there is a clear mess directly in front of him. Same with cleaning the bathroom, even if the sink is full of his hair from shaving. Often he will actually do these chores (dishes, cleaning the bathroom sink) after being reminded several days in a row. 


All of these are frustrating, but laundry is by far the worst. Trying to get him to do laundry is like pulling teeth. He will put it off as long as possible, until the hamper is overflowing and I have to do a couple of loads just to keep our bedroom from being overrun by laundry. Sometimes he will start a load of laundry and then let it sit in the washer, cycle completed and clothes wet, until I go and switch it over because I do not want to wear smelly clothes to work. 


Tonight was a major argument that led me to post this. I am facing a deadline in about two weeks from now at work. So, they have been having us work a lot of hours, including from home after we leave the office. Monday-Wednesday of this week, I worked several hours at night. Last night, I think my fiance could tell I was getting frustrated with work/wedding planning/chores, because he stated late last night ""I'm going to do a bunch of laundry tomorrow night."" I was excited--I knew it would probably still require my assistance but I was grateful that he was offering on his own. I told him that if I got home before him, I would start the first load. So, tonight I get home from work and right away start a load of laundry. When my fiance gets home, about 15 minutes later, I tell him that there's a load in the wash, he says thanks. Probably 90 minutes later, I remind him that there is wet wash in the machine that has to be switched over tonight; he says OK. 11:00pm and he's getting ready for bed, I again remind him about the laundry and he whines and complains telling me he'll do it tomorrow. I say no, it has to be switched tonight, it can't sit wet overnight or it might smell. He immediately gets defensive and tells me I never reminded him about the load, it's not his fault, he'll get it tomorrow. He tells me ""I said I'm sorry and that's it, I don't know what more you want me to do about it."" I want you to get up off your ass and switch the goddamn laundry!!!!!! But no. After this argument where we both yelled, which is very unusual for us, he got up and went to bed. I think I should add that he seemed to have ""forgotten"" after he realized that I am working from home tomorrow. I'm not sure if he thinks that just because I will be physically home tomorrow means that I can clean the house like I used to when I was unemployed, but I cannot. And, even if I could, I wouldn't because it is time he takes responsibility for half of the household chores.


I have tried in basically every way I can think of to get my fiance to help with chores, and with laundry specifically. At first, I would wash and fold his laundry and leave it in baskets, so all he had to do was put it away--I stopped that PDQ after seeing that the baskets would sit in our bedroom, literally next to his dresser, sometimes for weeks at a time. I have begged him. I have sobbed. I have gotten mad. I have tried to trade off chores (I'll do the laundry if you do the dishes). I have told him that our engagement rests on his help with chores (I have tried very hard not to issue empty treats and so have not yet given an ultimatum). Obviously, none of these have worked. I am at my wit's end. I have tried removing my laundry from our shared hamper and doing only my own. That works to get my own clothes clean but does nothing to keep our bedroom tidy and stop the hamper from overflowing. I feel absolutely terrible about ending an otherwise-great relationship with a wonderful human being over some chores. However, I know I cannot live the rest of my life as a maid. Also, I would like to add that I could conceivably take care of all of these chores on my own. We live in a small apartment and do not produce this much laundry. However, I do not want to and do not believe I should be required to do this all on my own. So, I am left in a situation where my clothes stay dirty for an additional week unless I do them; my favorite tupperware or the dishes we need for supper stay dirty unless I wash them; or I have to use a bathroom sink full of hair unless I clean it. I do not believe it is unreasonable to ask to live in a world where the sink is somehow free of my fiance's facial hair without actually having to remove that hair myself.


So, I am turning to the good people of Reddit to help me out here. Does anyone have any suggestions for another approach? Has anyone ever successfully navigated this problem? What should I do and how should I talk to my fiance about this?

"My (34F) family has disowned an uncle (67M) I love over inheritance


My grandmother passed away and left her house and all her assets to my uncle (1 of 5 children). He had lived with her for 50 years, including cooking and cleaning, and contributing to the house financially with his disability checks. 3 out of 4 of the remaining children (my aunts and uncles) freaked the hell out, tried to take him to court (failed) and since then have made his life a misery by harrassing him and insulting him, saying they were entitled to an equal share of the house and if he was a decent human being he would sell the house and split it. This actually made him quite ill and they backed off, freaking out about him dying and who was left in his will. Finally they were soooo generous (/s) and said they would leave him alone if he made a will saying it would be left to all of them equally. Hoping for him to die soon, I guess.

Well he refused to say who he was going to leave his stuff to in his will. He said it was none of their business. Now those 3 aunts and uncles, as well as their children (5 children, his nieces and nephews) have declared he is no longer family because he stole their inheritance and clearly didn't care about them.

My mother and I are still visiting him, but otherwise he is an isolated, disabled guy in his 60s who has now been dropped by his entire family. No christmas, no birthdays, no invitation to family events. He's had to deal with being disabled his entire life, and caring for his mother, now she's dead and the majority of his family have turned their backs on him over money (it is not even a massive sum of money, the house is worth £200k and there was £50k savings). So a decent amount but it's not like he has millions and is hoarding it, he has the house he has lived in for 50 years and contributed to the upkeep and mortgage of for 50 years, plus a bit of savings that will probably need to be spent on the house over the years as it needs some work done, and his disability checks.

I am disgusted by my families actions - his brother and sisters have abandoned him over money, and all their kids are just going along with it. I want to cut them all out of my life for good. They have insulted him, harrassed him, tried to take him to court, they've made him sicker, and demonstrated they never cared about him or his health. I don't want myself or my daughter (6 months) to have anything to do with them anymore, and my husband agrees.

However, my mum is begging me to still go to family events with her. We do big family celebrations, bbqs, christmas, birthdays, restaurant meals out. She wants me to go along (without my uncle as he is now banned from ALL family events) and just smile and pretend it's okay, because she says she ""doesn't want me to end up like him - shunned."" Well I'm ok with that, 100%. They have never done anything for me and if they are willing to shrug off family members over feeling entitled to an inheritance (none of them even care that if the house had been split he would be homeless and disabled since he wouldn't have the cash to buy a new place - none of them will acknowledge that he deserves the house considering he actually financially contributed to it for 50 years whereas they didn't spend a penny on it). 

My mum loves all her brothers and sisters even though they are doing this and is begging me not to ""rock the boat"" as it could come back on her and she can't imagine a life without all these family gatherings. She agrees that he deserves the house and she did not take part in the court attempt to question the inheritence, and she is still going to visit him privately - but she won't stand against the rest of the family either.

What should I do in your opinion? Go and let my daughter be brought up around people who would do this or stand my ground and say if they aren't willing to treat him fairly then they are not going to be part of my life either? Either way I will still be visiting my ""shunned"" uncle every week and my daughter will get to know him, there is no way I am partaking in this pathetic coventry just to try and make him so emotionally vulnerable he will give them the house I feel he is perfectly entitled to. If I keep seeing the family as normal I feel like I am condoning or taking part in his exclusion. If I refuse and say exclude me to if you can't be decent human beings, it will very much upset my mum, and may even have consequences for her as my family can be very petty and vindictive and don't like people disagreeing with them.

  **tl;dr**: My disabled uncle has been disowned due to receiving an inheritance that wasn't split between the rest of the family. I feel he deserves it; they don't and having failed to take it in court, have now decided as a family to shun him. I am not taking part in this, and I don't want to take part in family events where he is excluded. My mother is begging me not to cause problems and to just go along with it because she is scared of being shunned too but the whole thing makes me sick and I want nothing to do with them."
