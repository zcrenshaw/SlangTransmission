"[Update] I [28 M] asked my BF [28 M] of one year to come support me at my grandmother's funeral but he feels uncomfortable about it and does not want to come.


Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5t2iqk/i_28_m_asked_my_bf_28_m_of_one_year_to_come/

Hello there,

I wanted to give an update to the situation and also thank everyone for their comments and support. I took the time to read through almost all the comments and posts, but I was unable to respond to many of them because of everything that was happening. The funeral was yesterday and the days before that was spent with family. There was also a viewing on Sunday and that lasted the entire day.

When my BF came down on Friday, we talked some more about the situation and what was happening. It definitely was much easier to discuss everything in person as opposed to a phone call. After we talked about it, he was much more understanding about the situation. He told me that he was willing to come with me to the viewing on Sunday with me to support me. 

By this time, I had also cooled down a bit and thought about everything. By reading all the replies, I was able to understand that even though he wanted to support me through my time of need, it's not always clear cut as I thought it would be. He has anxiety when it comes to large crowds of people and he also did not know if my family knew of my situation of being gay. He felt very uncomfortable and pressured into a situation without any time to prepare. 

In the beginning, I failed to understand why those concerns would supersede my needs for support. But after cooling down a bit, I understood it more from his point of view. We were able to come to a compromise about it where he came with me to the viewing but not the funeral. While he was with me over the weekend, he was very sweet and caring and it helped me immensely.

All in all, it was a great learning experience and we both definitely learned about each other more. I think it made us closer and we are better for it.

I wanted to say thanks again to everyone who commented and provided advice and different perspectives. It made me extremely emotional (in a good way!) knowing that there were so many people willing to help. Thank you very much!

TL;DR: BF and I were able to discuss the situation and come to a compromise about it. We are still together and better after everything."

"UPDATE:Coworker [25F] thinks we [22F] [20 - 30 F/M] are using ""office politics"" to bully her? It was just a prank?


Previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uidmt/coworker_25f_thinks_we_22f_20_30_fm_are_using/)

So I didn’t confront Kathy during break. I didn’t even get to decide whether or not I wanted to because as soon as my break started, my Supervisor, Linda approached me. Linda explained that she knew Kathy reached out to me about the office clique. Over lunch, she told a story about how something like this happened to her in high school, and that Kathy was reaching out to me to be her proxy. That she knows I don’t hold these events but I should speak on Kathy’s behalf. I said I understood when another Supervisor,Dan butted in. 

Dan said Kathy also told him about the office problem, but he ignored it because he knew she has been invited. They discussed it among themselves and cited that people have used the company email to send out invites. This allowed the Supervisor to see the exchanges between everyone. Kathy had been invited and bluntly stated no to several things/not to waste her time. 

Linda apologized to me and told me to forget about the Kathy issue but the core message still counts. 

When I went to the break room, Kathy made a bee line for me. She started questioning me about how my talk with the Supervisor went. How together we could take down the ageist office group and that we should get coffee after work.  

I lied saying I had a family thing and went home. At home, I checked the reddit post and went back onto Kathy’s fb. There was a new post about how she was playing a little office prank on the office idiot. People commented her to “spill” but she didn’t update them. I feel like that was about me. 

I started screen capping her posts, though only the ones that flat out bullied people. I felt like HR would care about those then any grey areas. Aside from the racist post about Brad, she made a post about a plan to sleep with a married coworker by getting him drunk. 

All of this has been weird. At work, Kathy is a professional, determined and a little head strong. But in this field, thats a good thing. She gets good scores/reviews from clients. But now all I see is her posting vile things about people I care about. Calling it “TruthTea” then running to me like a victim of a make believe problem. 

I’m going to avoid her unless we’re on a project together. I don’t want to be her flying monkey. I don’t know what to believe from her anymore. 

TL;DR: Didn't confront Kathy but she got a Supervisor to talk to me. We found out she was lying and now I'm avoiding her. 

Edit: To answer someone who PM-ed me. Yes, I have high functioning autism. Yes, people at work know. 

Edit 2:

HR emailed me back. They said they were calling Kathy into work this weekend. Since the office isn't open the weekends, it's clear she's in trouble. As advised from an earlier reply, I'm not going to check her FB anymore. Though watching the fall out would be nice/have a laugh, I would feel petty (?)

I don't think Linda was trying to force me to do anything. She understands that I don't get some social things (If you check out my last post/replies, I literally said Kathy should just ask to be included). She was just trying to explain it in a way I'd understand. 

I fixed ""budded"" to ""butted"". Thank you for catching that.

I looked into the term ""Flying monkey"", and another subreddit came up (RBN). The people described there sound a lot like Kathy. 

I'm signing out now so I won't be replying until Monday. Sorry. 

Edit 3:
It looks like she was fired over the weekend. Her desk is empty but dented. I think she put up a fight because some coworker's desk decor are damaged. 

I won't be checking her FB to see the fall out. I have blocked her and am hoping for the best.

"My [24 M] parents [M 60/F 51] have threatened to disown me because my girlfriend [F 22] comes from a very poor background


For a little context – I originate from an African country. I come from a wealthy and prestigious family. My grandfather made his name, passed it onto my dad (who made a bigger name) and since I’m the only male among my siblings (got two younger sisters) I’m expected to follow in the same trend. All that though is probably going to go down the toilet because of the woman I love.

She doesn’t come from prestige or money. Far from it. Before I met her, she couldn’t even afford to buy socks of her own. I met her through one of the maids that work at my parents’ house – my girlfriend and the housemaid are neighbours, and we met when I dropped off the housemaid one day. I became captivated by my girlfriend after speaking to for like 5 minutes. We’ve been a couple for 18 months and I’ve never felt this way about a woman. Honestly, I love her so much I feel like I’m going to explode sometimes. I want to marry her. I want to have children with her.

My parents object. They object a lot. I was with my girlfriend for 10 months before telling them about her. I waited that long on purpose, because I knew they would disapprove. However, their reaction to our relationship has been more hostile than I thought it would be. I thought they would be fierce at first, but perhaps come around – especially my mother. 

Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. They have threatened to cut me off if I don’t end it – emotionally, financially, everything. My dad has told me he will write me out of his will if I don’t end it within 2 months (we’re 1 month in now). My parents have described my girlfriend as “trash” and that “she isn’t fit to walk on the same side of the street as me.” All this because she comes from a very poor family. They say she isn’t fit to bear the grandchildren that will one day take over my dad’s company through me.

I work for my father’s company. Because I’m his son, I hold a very high position for my age, and I get very good money for my age (I'd also like to think I'm good at my job). My dad told me that if I don’t end it, he’ll fire me. I’ve actually started looking for other jobs on the sly because of the situation I’m in. I’ll be severely fucked if I do get fired – I live alone and have a lot of bills to pay. 

What confounds the situation is that I’m paying for my girlfriend’s education. Despite her poor economic background hampering her studies, she’s really intelligent. She’s about to finish a diploma in telecommunications in June – she’ll begin a degree later in the year. I’m determined she get that bachelor’s degree – even if I get fired and I have to rob a bank in order to pay for her education. My girlfriend also has 9 younger siblings (yeah, crazy, I know) and they have their own problems and needs that I also take care of.

My parents are also racist. They don’t only object to my girlfriend because of her social and economic status, but because she isn’t black – because she is coloured (mixed). I received my bachelor’s degree at a British University, and I know that using that word to describe someone who is mixed or black in the UK, can be considered offensive and racist. But here in Africa, “coloured” people are what we use to describe mixed people. 

My girlfriend is a mixture of black and Arab (most coloured people here are that mix – goes back to the Arab Slave Trade on the East African coast back in the day). And although my girlfriend is not very devout, she identifies as a Muslim, which is a huge no-no in my family (we’re Christians) and something that my parents also loathe about her.

 **tl;dr**

There is no way I’m going to comply to my parents’ demands. Like I wrote before, I want to be with my girlfriend for the rest of my life – I want to have kids with her. However, the situation I’m facing is no joke. Getting fired and being completely cut off from my family will be very difficult. Despite their snotty ignorance and bigotry, I still love my parents. But it doesn’t seem like they will come around, and I guess this is where idealism clashes with pragmatism. Because idealism is telling me to remain with my girlfriend and ride out whatever my parents decide to do – but pragmatism knows that in the event of this, it will be a very difficult time for me. I would appreciate any advice on the situation.

Thank you

"How do I [36F] deal with my soon to be ex husband [37M] now that I'm dating again?


My soon to be ex husband and I were married for 2 years, together for 5.

He had an affair with a 21F waitress for 4 months, telling me he was working late on a large project. He was on a large project but not one that needed that much overtime as it turns out.

Anyway, after the project ended he got a promotion and then I found out about his affair. He tried to make it work for about 3 months but kept visiting that restaurant and blaming me for becoming emotionally and physically unavailable after the affair. 

He ended up leaving me and filing for a divorce. I was pretty crushed to have my husband leave me for a younger woman but I started recovering, all the usually stuff, gym, ice cream, retail therapy, actual therapy etc and then joined an online dating site.

About 4 months ago I met my current BF (38M) and he's a really great guy. We hit it off instantly and I know things are moving fast but we spend almost every day together at one of our houses and weekends too.

I've already met his friends and vice versa and everyone is quite happy for us. I personally have never been happier, I feel like I'm being treated right.

My soon to be ex husband, I have only talked to via my lawyers with regards to the divorce settlement.

I found out through the grapevine though that he was cheated on by that waitress and they have now broken up. 

To be honest, when I heard that news, I felt nothing. I thought I'd be happy because karma but I just didn't care (I don't know if that's normal).

When friends wanted to talk about it, I just told that that apart from the divorce, that chapter of my life was closed and I've moved on.

It helped that a few hours after I heard the news, I came home and my boyfriend had made the effort of plating up our takeout onto nice dinnerware complete with candles and flowers. I get that this is the honeymoon stage but I just love that I have a relationship were we are both invested in making an effort.

My ex however, who hadn't bothered in all this time to contact me outside our lawyers, recently found out though that I had been seeing someone else and he called me a few days ago, incredibly irate that I was seeing someone else and how I moved on before the divorce was final.

My mind is blown. He moved on whilst we were still married! What the hell is going through his head that he doesn't see how hypocritical that is?

He blamed his affair on ""mid life crisis"" and work stress and how he was wrong to leave et. 

I know he's just back because he got dumped and he's using me because he doesn't want to be alone.
 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have two questions:

1) I'm not mentally braced for the emotional turmoil this has thrown even though I 100% know I do not want to get back with him. How do I stay strong? I feel so attacked even though he's being so ludicrous.

2) How do not let my current relationship suffer because of the emotional effect this is having on me? I don't want to have my BF have to put up with this. "
"My extended family disowned my cousin [40sM] when he came out to them decades ago. I [28F] recently found him on Facebook and want to reach out to him.


As a kid, my primary babysitter/after school caretaker was my dad's cousin, Tony. When I was in fourth grade, Tony came out to his parents. They disowned him, kicked him out of the house, and told the whole extended family who also disowned him. He moved away soon after, and I was heartbroken that someone who had been such a big part of my life so far was just suddenly gone with no goodbye.  Nobody in the family explained to me, and when I got older I just thought Tony had just gone off to college at the time since he was the right age for it. 

So this past December I was telling one of my cousins about how I'd tried to find Tony over the past few years just doing some googling/Facebook but couldn't find anything. And she told me the whole story and that Tony had changed his last name. 

After that, it was super easy to find Tony. And it turns out he actually lives in the same state as me, just an hour's drive away! All of our extended family lives thousands of miles away in the area Tony and I were born and raised in. It's a crazy coincidence but I guess not that crazy since it is a much more tolerant area than where we come from. 

So here's the thing. I really want to get in touch with Tony. I wanted find him before because he was a really important person in my childhood, and I (surprise surprise) don't have a great relationship with my parents or the extended family either. But now that I know he was disowned by the family, it feels like it might be selfish to reach out to him just because of my own emotional desires. I know he loved me when I was a kid, but I'm bound to be a reminder of a really traumatizing time in his life. I even have the last name he deliberately chose to leave behind. Ugh. 

I found him on Facebook, so the practical part of it is easy enough. It would be so easy to send him a message. I've just been sitting on this for two months now, arguing myself in circles. On one hand, maybe he'd be happy to find out not everyone in his family hates him for his sexuality, but on the other hand, maybe he's just moved on and doesn't want to open that door again. From what I can tell he seems to be doing well for himself. He looks happy and healthy in what few photos I can see, and he has a good job in a field I remember he was always interested in when I was a kid. We used to watch tv programs about it together. 

So I guess my question is: should I do it? Should I send him a message? And if I do, how can I do it in a way that is respectful to him and what he's gone through?

**tl;dr** I [28F] found out recently that my cousin [40sM] was disowned two decades ago by my family for being gay. I want to contact him, but I think it might be selfish to force him to relive some very painful memories. Should I contact him? Is there a way to do it that is respectful to him and what he's been through?

"My [20M] family is upset with my for trying to change my name. UPDATE


Original https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5rako9/my_20m_family_is_upset_with_my_for_trying_to/

Soo... Kind of a strange update. In my original thread, /u/dragonflytype pointed out that There was a threaf that was similar, but from the other perspective. I checked it out and it was eerily similar to my situation, from what OP said in the remaining comments. I asked my dad about it and it turns out he did actually post it. Some minor things didn't match up, we both changed a couple minor details to preserve anonymity. But he kind of gave that away when he said my name in the comments.

So to the update, everyone is still pretty upset about it. My dad has been sulking about it a lot. He's still struggling with the idea that hes going to be the last of his name (and here I was thinking that ""your father's name"" meant his last name, not the whole thing.) My brother, who is more like my dad than I am is mad. I think he does like the tradition, and is pissed that I came first. So he's mad at me, too. Dad called my Grandad and he's on his side, too. Mom has been more quiet. She's really conflict-avoiding and I think that might be why she agreed to name me this in the first place.

So it's been rough, but more than anything, it's strengthened my resolve. No one has talked to me about my feelings, just how i'm turning my back on the ""family legacy."" All I could do was point out to them is that their arguments are exactly what I was talking about. They're making me feel like I'm nothing more than a vessel to carry on a name rather than someone who was desired as a person. It got a little heated when my dad, grandad and brother had an intervention of sorts with me about it. I was pissed and told them, straight up that the tradition is dead. You can either have this decision with me, now and alone, or in a few years when I have a pregnant partner, and they can take us both on at once (I would never want to put this pressure on a GF or wife, especially while she's pregnant. That part of why I think this is important to do now.)

After their total lack of support, the offer to work with my parents on picking out a new name together is off the table. I've made the decision on my own. I love my new name :). My friends are cool with it, and Ive given my family one month's grace. At the end of February, I will correct them every time, and that will last 2 months. After that, I will refuse to respond if they call me by former name. The paperwork is filed to make it legal, so I think it's going well overall.

Picking out my new name obviously caused its own problems. As so as I told my dad, I got the immediate response that ""That's too modern! Why are you giving up a name with historical integrity for something so new?"" Brother was again pissed that I followed through with it because ""The name is dead!!!!!!!!"" I actuay don't think either name I've picked out or myself is particularly modern, but they are probably a bit newer than William.

So that's kind of where we are now. My family is now pissed with me, but I'm holding my own. I've got my new name, which I absolutely love, and I'm in the process of a legal name change.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fr0bs/me_18f_with_my_husband_20m_he_wants_me_to_give_up/


I'm getting a divorce. I'll give a quick summary of the past few months:

We started marriage counseling, and I began to realize exactly how selfish of a person he is. The therapist asked, ""what is the biggest problem you're having with your partner?"" to each of us. His response? ""Well, I really don't like it when she fact-checks me. It makes me angry because it seems like she doesn't trust me.""
My response was ""I do not feel respected. He does not see us as equals and I can't continue being his emotional punching bag."" (Which was a line from one of the comments, thanks guys!)


She told him after a month or so of sessions that he needed to seek individual therapy for his emotional instability, because he kept lying and contradicting himself TO THE THERAPIST. What's the point of going if you pretend everything's fine and dandy?


About October I told him that I couldn't continue the relationship. He was getting more and more aggressive and even punched a hole through our wall. He started throwing things and his fuse was incredibly short. So I told him I was done. It wasn't healthy for me and it wasn't healthy for our daughter. 


Skipping ahead a bit to my current situation:
I have moved up with my parents. Divorce papers were filed about a month ago now, and luckily he agreed to all of the things we discussed. I'm very glad there was no conflict on that front, but his mom is a divorce lawyer so she wouldn't have let him mess around. 

Candice is very happy, because she gets to play with her grandpa any time she wants (he's a stay at home parent). 

I don't really have any connections here other than my parents and brother, but that's okay. I feel so much happier just being away from him. Now I've just got to find a job!

"My husband [39/M] is afraid to get help for a simple medical issue and I (his wife) [41/F] intervened. Now he's furious saying I'm controlling.


I have been married to my husband for just over 15 years. I became a family physician and contrary to people’s perception, a lot of doctors don’t marry nurses or other doctors, we marry non-MDs all the time. My husband is a business executive, has two graduate degrees and is very smart – he’s very quick witted, very strong-willed and intellectually very focused. He’s a much better debater than I am, too. 

Our marriage works because we’re equals; but, we had a rocky start. When I graduated from medical school, I had a bit of the god complex and often talked-down to people (family and friends, mostly, but sometimes patients) which alienated my close friends. My husband and I nearly divorced early on, but I worked through my issues and we’ve come to accept certain boundaries. One of them being that I try not to talk-down to my husband using a medical degree as a magic wand. 

But, a problem as bubbled up. My husband isn’t diligent with his health or seeing a doctor. He’s very much “too manly” to see a doctor and also has a turgid fear of needles. I understand and respect that. I booked him with a colleague (a female doctor who works with people who are afraid/fearful of doctors/needles/medical procedures) and he’s gone, a few times, but only under duress.

 His rationale is that he doesn’t want to go to a doctor I know – I know a lot of doctors, it’s hard to find one I don’t know in the area. Normally this wouldn’t bug me, but I love and care about him and his health is important to me and of course an issue everyone has to deal with. He’s getting to an age where he needs to see one more regularly. His fear of needles is pretty bad and needs an EMLA patch and Ativan for blood work, which is fine; but, getting him to go to the doctor and for blood work is a big fight. I go to appointments with him, am very reassuring and sit through blood tests; but, it’s not enough. We went through all this a year and a half ago and it is time again to see a doctor. He has been complaining of pain that is very evidently a hernia he got from hauling drywall for a basement. I have been after him more and more vocally to see a doctor. It’s gotten so comically out-of-hand that I finally booked an appointment with his doctor and told the receptionist what his specific concerns were. 

I told my husband, and he immediately flew off the handle. He said I was doing it again where I was using my medical degree to be controlling and we got into a huge fight. I don’t feel like I’m wrong. He basically walks holding his groin, tries not to laugh and has avoided sex for weeks. He’s putting himself through hell because he’s afraid and it’s just a bad way to live your life. I told him I’d go with him to the appointments and would be there for everything, and I know I can’t make people not afraid, but it’s the best we can do. He has to go. 

Am I wrong here? Am I being controlling?

I decided to write each of them a personal thank you letter. I told them how much each gift meant to me, I got a lot of hugs and my sister cried.

Unfortunately my brother in law cracked his femur. We were fixing the roof of the main sheep barn(part of the roof had collapsed like a week ago due to snow, we moved the sheep as soon as it did) and more of the roof collapsed on him and pinned his leg. Larrys dad(he's subbing for Larry) picked the roof up off of him and I managed to drag him out. Since its cracked and not fractured he didn't need surgery but he'll be in a cast for 10 weeks.

Larrys staying with us since hey might as well keep both of the broken bone pair together. My sister got out of her lease early and is now living here.

"My (19/F) sister's (28/F) photographer boyfriend (25/M) is spreading rumors about me saying I've been trying to sleep with him to further my modeling career.


First, I want to say I've never flirted with him, nor given him any indication that I was at all interested (because I wasn't and I'm still not). That said, when he and my sister hit the five month mark and started dating seriously, and she brought him around to meet the family, she mentioned that he was interested in photographing new people, adding some new faces to his portfolio. He photographs mostly portrait and editorial. He's been published a few times in some magazines, and he's pretty well known in the photography community here, but it's just a hobby for him. As a job he's sous chef at a restaurant downtown. My sister told him I model, so we naturally started talking about photography and our favourite concepts. I had actually heard of him prior to the introduction. He had photographed a model friend of mine a year earlier. She only had good things to say about him at the time. The photos turned out really well.


Fast forward a few weeks. My sister updated her FB relationship status to say that she was in a relationship with him. My model friend knows her, has her added, saw the status change, and  promptly send me a text saying, ""Your sister is dating a creep. Tell her to stay away from that guy."" I was taken aback, so I asked my friend to elaborate and she basically sent me screen shots of hers and this guy's text message conversations. It was professional at first. He would only message her regarding photography, and shoot locations/details, but the more and more they talked, the worse and worse it got. He began hitting on her rather aggressively, saying things like, ""My dick gets hard when I look at your raws."" By 'raws' he means raw, unedited images. Nasty. Anyway, my friend was *a little receptive* to his behaviour when he was just complimenting her bone structure and whatnot, but as soon as he got into boner territory, she kindly asked him to stop, and he did ... until a month after he and my sister got together. He apparently messaged my friend after that and asked if she wanted to grab drinks. They hadn't been speaking for months by this point, so she was thrown off and disgusted, and she told him no. He backed off. 


They had never grabbed drinks before that, so he definitely wasn't asking as a friend. He was trying to hook up with her, while in a relationship with my sister, and who knows how many other models he's been hitting on and potentially sleeping with, behind my sister's back. 


I showed my sister the screenshots. At first she was shocked, grossed out and thankful towards my friend and I, said she was going to dump him, etc., but then a couple of days later, she sent me this long message basically calling me for trying to fuck up her relationship because I'm 'jealous' and 'desperate' for attention. It came out of nowhere, and she sent me screenshots of mine and her boyfriend's FB messages regarding photography. It was professional. He kept it professional. I kept it professional. We only discussed shoots, and our favourite locations, and my sister *knew* we talked about that stuff. She wasn't unaware of it. She would sometimes chime in saying he should photograph me. So for her to bring up those conversations as if I was trying to steal her boyfriend, noooooo. She said he told her I've been hitting on him, but it was always in person so there was no hard evidence of it. Never happened. The only times I've seen him in person is when she's there, too. I've never seen him privately. I've never hit on him, not even slightly. That's gross. 


So now I don't know what to do. They're both trying to turn people against me. I model full time. It's my job. It's how I pay for school and my apartment. If she wants to delude herself into thinking her cheating boyfriend is telling the truth, then that's her right, and she'll one day realize how wrong she is, but I already know they're whispering about me to people in the photography and modeling community. He's probably doing it to cover his ass, and she's probably going along with it because she loves him and feels backed into a corner. 


What should I do? 


**tl;dr** She believes him. I don't know what to do. On s personal level I know there's nothing I can do to prove to her that he's making it up. She has to come to that conclusion on her own but his bs is hurting my career now. They're trying to damage my reputation as a model, and it's so infuriating. How do I recover from this? "

"My (18/M) friend's (18/M) younger sister (17/F) carved my initials into her arm.


To my knowledge she's had a crush on me for a couple of years now. I've been friends with her brother since eighth grade. I used to go to their house a lot in the beginning, and she would always make a ton of excuses to drop by his room, come down to the basement, pop in wherever he we were chilling, etc. At school she would always walk by my locker, stare at me, giggle with her friends. I didn't really care for the most part. I figured it was just a little crush. No big deal. I'm not interested in her like that, but her crush was never bad enough that I felt I had to step in and say something. 


That all changed when I started dating my current girlfriend, Neha. I can be a little clueless sometimes. I trust Neha's point of view, and according to her, my friend's sister has an unhealthy obsession with me. Not just an innocent crush. Apparently his sister has been going around telling people in her grade that I kissed her on her birthday. Never happened. I didn't even see her on her birthday. I was away on a family trip at the time. The weirdest part is, she concocted this whole story about how I texted her to come out of her house at the stroke of midnight, and that we kissed on the back porch and talked for hours about our ambitions. Not one part of that is true. A couple of people have come up to me to ask. Some people believe her, but anyone who knows me personally, knows that it never happened. I don't really care about the gossip, but the fact that she's making up stories is a little concerning. 


I told my friend. He's a good guy. I know he wouldn't blow up at her angrily. They're on good terms and they don't argue at all from what I've seen, so I trusted that he would handle it correctly. He was very embarrassed on her behalf, and he apologized to me, and then a few weeks went by where his sister left me alone entirely. I thought the situation was sorted and over, but I was wrong. 


Turns out she carved my initials into her arm, and she showed it to a few people in her grade. They're my Korean initials, which not many people know as I have a different name that I use at school and on my birth certificate. The only people who use my Korean name are my older family members. That said, my close friends, girlfriend and apparently my best friend's sister know about my Korean name. No one else really does. My girlfriend saw the initials on an IG photo in which my friend's little sister was posing with her friends, and didn't really make an effort to hide the marking. She's been telling other people that those initials belong to her boyfriend from a different school, but I don't really believe that. I'm pretty sure my friend is fully aware of the marking, and didn't tell me because he (rightly) didn't want me to lose my shit, but now that I've seen evidence of how far her obsession has gone, I'm a little worried. 


Is it normal to do this sort of thing? Can it be chalked up to a crush gone too far? An embarrassing high school story? Or should I reach out to her and explain how uncomfortable this makes me? 


**tl;dr** She's always had a crush on me. I used to think it was an innocent high school thing, but recently she's been making up stories about me kissing her (I didn't) and she has my Korean initials carved into her arm. My friend has tried talking sense into her, and for a few weeks everything was cool, but I'm worried now. Can this be chalked up to a crush gone too far or should I talk to her about cooling it? "

"My (26/M) roommate's girlfriend (32/F) has been staying with us for free, eating my food, and has recently tricked my roommate (28/M) into buying her designer bags that he can't afford, with the money that I loaned him.


She was cool at first, but as soon as she lost her job, she turned into a complete nightmare. First of all, I said it was okay for her to stay with us *temporarily* as she couldn't afford rent for her place anymore and we had the room to spare. We decided one month was a good enough period of time for her to find another job, and start looking for a cheaper apartment in a different area of the city. 

It's been three months.

Over the course of the past three months, she's been at home 90% of the time, watching Netflix, *not* looking for a job or a new place, and she's been eating my food on top of everything. I'm okay with people using my stuff as long as they ask, but she outright just opens bottles of wine, uses 5/12 eggs to make an omelette, leaves bread out in the open all day making so that I come home after work to find the bread stale, half of my groceries gone, alongside other petty, avoidable situations. I've spoken to her and my roommate about this separately and together, and they explained that she just doesn't know what's mine and what's his, but that's beside the point. She's being a bad roommate. Point blank. Even if they were his groceries, have some respect for your SO's hard earned money. Don't leave things out. Act like the 30-something you are. Obviously I communicate those sentiments in a nicer way, but that's she gist.

Recently she *has* been looking for her own place, which is a good step, and she hasn't been up to her usual antics but my roommate took a massive pay cut at work and he needed some extra to pay for his car, and his mother's hospital bills, so I told him I'd lend him the money. It was three thousand. Nothing life-changing, just enough to get him back on his feet for the time being. Come to find out, his girlfriend has been toting around two new designer bags that she can't afford. My girlfriend came over, made nice with her as she usually does, and casually asked if she got those bags for Christmas. Turns out she didn't. They were from my roommate, and he bought them for her to make her feel better because she didn't crush the job interview she had been gearing up towards. I want to emphasize that this girl is prettier than most other girls my roommate has dated. He's an average looking guy, so I'm guessing he's enduring her bs because he feels he can't do any better. That's his choice. But even the mere chance that he used the money I loaned him to pay for her consolation gift ... no, that won't fly. 


I asked my roommate about it, and he tried to deny it at first, but he eventually owned up to it and said that she kind of backed him into a corner. He feels like he can't break up with her now because she relies on him too much. I get that, but he really didn't have to buy her the bags. So either he's making excuses or she's pulling the strings. Either way I'm tired of it and I'm worried for my friend. I want to have one final talk with him about losing this girl before I make any drastic decisions like moving out. What should I say? I've known him since we were in our first year of uni. He's a good friend. He's normally not like this at all. I don't want to shift all the blame on his SO, but he genuinely wasn't acting like this until he met her. 


TL;DR - I want to have one final talk with him about this before I start looking for another apartment/roommate. He's a good friend. We've known each other for years. I don't want to see him go down this path, and I do think he realizes how toxic she is as a person, but he's a little insecure when it comes to dating, and this girl is easily the prettiest he's ever dated. Personally I'm done with both of them if this persists. "
"Me [22 M] with my friend [21 F], gave away her spot in our senior year house for next year. Who's the asshole?


I'll be a senior in university next year and I've been looking for a house for me and 2 other close friends. We decided to add on a person to our hunt since there really aren't many 3 person houses near my university.

Backstory: I'm trying to live with 2 of my closest friends for senior year. We've been through a lot together and are really tight. If we don't live together, then pretty much I have to find a single on campus and be super lonely, which sounds like a terrible way to graduate university. The two of them have been abroad for the majority of this semester, so I've been spearheading the search for a place off campus. I definitely worked harder at searching for a place than some of my classwork (not recommended) and as a result, I'm pretty tired and frustrated. There is basically no place that is a) fits everyone's budget, b) is close enough to campus, and c) is a decent place to live that's not run down. Except, after all this time searching I finally found a place that seemed to fit the criteria. 

So, I went and checked out the house with the girl we added into our search. She liked it, but said she wanted to hear what my other friends said about it and then she would decide. I showed them the photos and they loved it. Case closed right?

Well, I'm trying to collect the first month's rent from everyone and she's hesitating. She comes out and says that ""being straightforward, I'm looking at a cheaper place with some other people"" and to wait until she could see the other house. I got really angry at her and asked why she didn't bring that up before. She says she did when we left the house viewing (and I don't remember that at all, but let's say she did). She certainly didn't make a big deal about it when she was supposedly talking about it to me. I ask her how likely she is to pick this other place, and she says ""50/50"". 

Essentially, me and the other friends agreed that if this house didn't work out, we would give up because the deadline for on campus eligibility was ending soon. So, I panicked. I messaged a bunch of friends who I knew might need housing, and in 20 mins I found an acquaintance that wanted the spot and he got me the check the day after. 

I message her today letting her know that I'm sorry but her spot in the house was gone. She was really upset. Normally, stuff like this doesn't get to me, but the messages she sent sound really hurt and as far as I can see - our friendship is pretty dead. That sucks, she's a cool person and I care about her. So, I'm not sure how to approach her.

On one hand, it was shitty of me to give away her spot without even telling her I was going to. She said she would have just made a decision if I would have told her and that I really betrayed her. On the other hand, I worked really hard for this and wasn't about to let someone's indecision to ruin my senior year with my best friends. Honestly, if she would have said anything other than ""50/50"" this probably wouldn't have happened. To me, she was trying to play the field on both sides and kept us as a back up plan. I'm hurt too to be honest.  

edit: thanks for all the advice everyone. obviously I still think my friend was jeopardizing everything, but I now see that I could have easily waited another day or at least let her know. it was a shitty decision in a high pressure situation, so hopefully yall can learn from my mistake.

My ex-husband and I broke up 2 years ago after I found out he was cheating on me. We have two kids now aged 6 and 8 who live with me and they visit their dad once a week and then stay with him every other weekend. Our break-up/divorce was messy and now we don’t talk to each other unless it is about the kids. 


His new girlfriend moved in with him a couple months ago. I didn’t even know that he had a girlfriend and he never told me that she was moving in.  He also didn’t tell the kids – they only found out when they went to stay and they were the ones to tell me. I admit, I was not happy that my kids were now staying with someone who I didn’t know at all but I have spent so much of my energy the last two years fighting with him. So I told him I wish that he had told me about her and then I left it at that.


The boys were supposed to be going this weekend and they really didn’t want to go. They told me it was because it was they don’t like her. They say she is bossy and mean and makes their dad less fun. I know kids exaggerate and she is probably not *that* bad but It has got to be hard for them to suddenly be around this woman all the time who they don’t know. I also know our oldest still was hoping we would get back together so that must be hard – facing the reality that it isn’t going to happen.


Yesterday, when he came to pick them up they told him they didn’t want to go and they told him why. This led to a huge argument in which he blamed ME for encouraging the kids to dislike her because I was jealous. I’ve never said anything about her to the kids and I try to ignore their moaning. I’ve also never even met her so I don’t even have an opinion on her. 


I managed to make the boys go but according to my ex’s messages they have been badly behaved and it’s all my fault. I then got a message from his girlfriend this morning asking me why I hated her so much when she has been so nice to the kids. I’m so tempted to reply something bitchy but I’m trying to rise above it all but I feel like I’m being attacked for no reason. The kids are misbehaving because the last 2 years have been rough for them anyway and they were just getting settled and now they have another big change that they knew nothing about.

Ok, this is mostly a rant but any advice would be useful. Do I reply and tell them exactly how I feel, that yes I’m not happy at the situation but it is not my fault? Or just stay quiet and hope things settle down? For me, this is so frustrating because it feels like our break-up is never ending.

"Coworker [25F] thinks we [22F] [20 - 30 F/M] are using ""office politics"" to bully her?


I've been a high school girl, so I know bullying in the form of ostracization. But this is not the case. There are no ""office politics"" oppressing the victim. 

More or less, everyone in our office became close knit about 3 months ago. We were all in the same training class for a new branch in our company. After finishing training, majority of the people in the office felt comfortable exchanging Facebook info. 

One person, Kathy [25F], told us all she didn't use Facebook. This was a lie because I had searched her name and found her before she stated this. It was an active and very public account, but I never outted her to the rest of the group. I believed it was her nice way of turning us down. I understood because not everyone is comfortable with work friends on their personal media. 

Some weeks past and she lets it slip that she has a Facebook. Something about her dislike about her friends sharing stuff on her Feed. She was called out and she admitted she just didn't want to mix business with pleasure. **Kathy didn't want work to get mixed with her personal life.** Again, we understand.

So more months passed. And during said months, our group interacted outside of work. We went shopping together, had BBQ, movie nights, drank wine and watched Scandal, etc. And with this came inside jokes, more invitations, and emotional connections (?)

Last Monday, Kathy complained to me that our coworkers Brad and Joey were having a laugh during break. She feeling left out, asked what was so funny. They said she just had to be there to get it. She asked them to say it anyway, and that she'd probably get it. They did through giggles and when Kathy didn't laugh, they repeated she just had to be there to get it. When Kathy repeated the joke for me, I burst out laughing because it was an inside joke about something that happened at Joey's movie night. Kathy seemed hurt and went back to her desk. 

Today during break, Patrice asked our other coworker Nancy what she should bring to Scandal night. This exchange happened in front of me and Kathy. Again Kathy piped up and asked what they were talking about. They explained that a few of us coworkers were getting together to watch Scandal and drink wine. Girl talk and stuff. They then started a conversation about the latest episode. 

Kathy pulled me to the side and asked if everyone was doing things without her. I told her yes. She asked why she wasn't invited and I explained that it was because she told us she didn't want to mix business with pleasure. She still insisted it was rude not to ask and they were using ""office politics"" to bully her. She ranted about how she feels victimized and ostracized when she isn't included. 

How do I explain it to her that her not being included is her fault and she can't force people to like/invite her?

TL;DR: Coworker doesn't want to mix personal life with work. She gets annoyed when everyone seems closer and does things outside of work without her. 

EDIT: Bolded for emphasis since there is some confusion. Kathy has stated she doesn't want coworker interaction outside of work. Not just Facebook. 

Ever since Kathy found out everyone does interact outside of work, she's been very curious about my texting (on break or after work). She wants to know if I'm texting X coworker or doing to X's coworker's event. 

**UPDATE (is this how I do it?):**

I talked my coworkers during our time before shift starts (usually a coffee and donuts thing for everyone). I phrased it so that it seemed like I was hurt by the group talking about Scandal night in front of me. They understood and promised to keep that to themselves. I also stated that maybe next time me and Kathy could go. 

Nancy was confused and Brad was visually disagreeing/pissed. Apparently, Kathy lied to me about not being invited. Why, I don't know. 

Nancy sent Kathy a FB message weeks ago. Nancy said that she was thinking about having a TV and wine night. She listed a few shows and asked Kathy which would like to watch. It took Kathy a few days to respond after reading it. In the response, she said she “had better things to do then drink cheap wine and watch trash tv.”. Also to not message her on FB again. I physically saw the message to confirm it wasn’t some fake screenshot. I asked Nancy why she didn’t tell us about this and she said it would make the workplace hostile.  

Brad also noted Kathy was a bitch and that I should just check out her Facebook. So I did and like before it's a very active and public account. Apparently, for months she's been posting status (Kathy's Tea) about our workplace. Sometimes venting, sometimes actually harmful statements. One that really bothered Brad was when she took creepshots of everyone and posted that he was a fat N-word (hard r), something about Tyler Perry. He only found this out because one of Kathy's FB friends sent it to him. 

I was also not left out as she posted a direct photo from my own social media and captioned it that I'm a bottle redhead who sets feminist back. There was something about Nancy's Scandal night, but she called it for desperate soccer moms and wannabe stepford wives. 

Brad said he didn't want to tell us because he went to HR and they haven't gotten back to him yet. That they said though it counts as cyber bullying, it's her social media BUT she had her phone on the work floor (against the rules).  

So now I have all this information and confused on what to do. Kathy's been lying to me and very rude herself. But why would she lie to me? What her end game? 

I have about 4 hours until my break with Kathy. Should I confront her?"

"My [41f] ex-wife [39f] told all of her friends we divorced because I cheated on her, which is a lie. I have to face them all this weekend for the first time, and I'm so anxious about it.


My ex-wife and I were together for six years. We had a son together, and divorced two years ago. Our son was two at the time, and is four now. My ex and I split custody 50/50, and while we're not ""friends"", we are civil to each other, text daily regarding our son, and overall I think we co-parent well. 

Since my ex got pregnant, our relationship became tumultuous and never recovered. The last ~2.5 years we were together were horrible. By the end, it was clear we both needed out. 

When our son was two (and we were living together, obviously), she came into the kitchen and said to me ""I don't want to be married to you, honestly I don't even like you as a person, and I want to get a divorce."" 

This was a hard and shitty conversation, but I felt it too, and so we mostly-calmly talked about it. We agreed that we would keep living together for a bit while we figured out how to split everything, talked a lot about child custody rules (because we're both women and she was the one who birthed our son from a donor, I was terrified of her taking him away), and also talked about other rules regarding each other. We agreed to sleep in separate beds, for example. We also agreed that we could see other people. Because there was so much more important logistics shit to talk about though, we didn't spend a lot of time processing the part about seeing other people. We agreed we could, ""as long as we didn't bring them back to the house ever,"" and we went on to discuss more important things.

My ex and I hadn't slept together since she became pregnant 2.5 years earlier. I was heartbroken, felt shitty, etc., and hooked up with a friend about a month later. I was still living with my ex at the time. I never brought this friend back to our place (as I agreed to in our rules), but we started seeing each other pretty regularly, mostly as friends who were hooking up. I want to be clear here that I wasn't skipping out on parenting duties at all. Even during this time, my ex and I were splitting time with our son equally. She'd leave to go hang out with her friends and I'd stay home with our son just as frequently.

Anyway, after about a month (so two months after we separated), she asked if I slept with this friend. I said yes. Immediately she accused me of cheating on her, and said I needed to move out immediately. *Now, to be clear, I **know** it was shitty for me to sleep with someone while we were still living together.* I know that was unethical. I wish I had moved out earlier. But I was afraid of moving away from my son without custody sorted out, didn't have the disposable income to rent another place straight away, etc. I think it was a shitty situation. But I maintain that I did not cheat on her. We were talking about nothing other than how to move forward with divorce. The relationship was over.

This was all two years ago. We don't talk about it anymore, and co-parent fine together. She is now engaged to another woman and is very happy. It's all fine.

**The crux of this post is** that she told everyone in our lives (including every member of my family) that we divorced because I cheated on her. As far as they are concerned, we were in a happy, loving relationship raising a toddler, I cheated, and so then, begrudgingly and heartbreakingly, she divorced me. It just isn't reality. 

I've always hated that her friends still view me this way, but I don't think about it too much these days. **However,** all of these friends are coming into town this weekend for a party for our son, and she invited them. Which is fine - except I'm anxious as ALL HELL to see them for the first time since, knowing that they think I selfishly ruined our lives.

I talked to my ex about this and asked her to clear the story up with them. She flipped out on me and we fought about it. She even said at one point ""It felt like cheating, so it was cheating."" 

I know that it's crazy town to personally go up to each of her friends and ""set the story straight,"" but I don't know how to handle seeing them all this weekend. I really don't want them to think this horrible thing of me. 

Is there anything I can do?

**TL;DR**: My ex and I agreed to separate when our son was two. I slept with a friend. She told everyone that I cheated on her, and *that's* the reason we got divorced. I don't know how to face them this weekend, and really want to set the story straight. Is there any way to maintain face here?"

"My wife [31/F] feels guilty about something that isn't her fault. She's driving me [30/M] crazy with her contrition, I think it may be PTSD.


Throwaway because my wife knows my account. Hopefully she doesn’t see this.

Last July 4th weekend, my wife held a Saturday BBQ for friends and family. She was stressed-out and we got into an argument about an ingredient she needed. It's not easy to get and I needed to go a ways away to find it. So I did. 

Only, I never came back. Some drunken teenager and his friends t-boned me. The car was totaled and I was lucky I was alive. My wife didn't know and was fuming with how late I had become. Eventually, some State Troopers informed her where I was and even drove her to the hospital. 

Anyway, a half dozen surgeries later, a couple of days in a coma and some ICU action and I'm home. Of all the things that happened, I basically walked away without any long-term damage. I am still afraid of needles and never again need to be poked, prodded or invaded so long as I live, but, I'm good. 

My wife. Not so much. She beat herself up. Blamed herself for sending me out there. She would sit in the hospital room and cry when she thought I was asleep. Even now, 8 months later, we can't fight about anything; she quickly goes to pieces if I get upset with her; she gets shaky when I go to work, or if I'm going out for anything; if someone asks about the accident, she tears up and beings panting, says she can’t go into it. I sometimes wake-up because she keeps saying “sorry” in my ear. I mean it got to be a bit much. I have an L-shaped scar on my chest that is fairly prominent, but is slowly fading. After sex, or if I’m sleeping without a shirt, She runs her fingers down the scar and says: “I. Could. Have. Killed. You. Bad. [WifeofStawmThrowah]. Bad.”

We got a therapist, but that was, on the whole, not helpful. We tried two therapists. One was in her early twenties and basically had nothing constructive to add, only that she was single and basically kept asking how we met and about asking women out in general. The other, an older woman, was a loon, and kept asking if we felt a cosmic connection. All-in-all, it didn’t help my wife any, and only made her resistant to therapy. The thing is, her contrition hasn’t stopped. If I get annoyed with her and want to discuss an issue, she gets really emotional, apologizes, hugs me and then says something about how we have a second chance. Then she cries for 10 minutes. I really think she’s got PTSD from this – I got a new car and a sweet story to tell to get sympathy from friends, but it somehow really affected her. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Two bad therapist experiences has really made her avoidant to any further therapy. I told our family doctor who seems to agree with me, but says that I can’t unilaterally force her into therapy. Meanwhile, we haven’t discussed anything in 8 months and I can’t go 10 minutes without her around my either getting upset because I’m going to work or moping while I watch Seinfeld reruns on TV.

tl;dr I think my wife has PTSD and I have no experience with this. I can't seem to get her back into therapy and I'm not sure how to proceed. This is starting to drive me a bit batty. "
"Me [20M] with my Step Brother [22M] wont talk to me or even acknowledge me because I had a guy friend sleep over in my room.


***I'm a girl, I didn't realize I put M instead of F.

This started about 2 months ago.  

To put a little bit of background on this situation.  I currently live with my step sister (20) and my step brother (22) and his girlfriend (23) in a house.  

I want to lay out all the facts and make the story seem as unbiased as possible.  I just need to know if I'm being the unreasonable one here.

My step brother has been a little bit over protective recently.  I just got out of a 2 year bad relationship at the beginning of December.

I moved into my sisters house toward the end of December.

About a month and a half to 2 months ago I had a guy friend sleep over during the week.  For the story's sake I'm going to call him B.  We kind of have a friends with benefits thing going on so we had sex and just hung out in my room the whole night.  We weren't loud and didn't interact with anyone else that was in the house. 

I had work the next day so I had to wake up early.  I woke up B the next morning and told him I needed to leave so he should too.  He's super not a morning person so he kinda woke up, I was in a rush and just left (a mistake on my part).  I thought he was going to be right out the door a couple minutes after me but he ended up falling back asleep.  

My brother called me at work at around 9:00 am telling me that B was still in my room sleeping.  My brothers gf was getting upset and told my brother she didn't feel comfortable taking a shower with a ""stranger"" in the house.  

I told my brother I would call B and tell him to leave.  I did that and B ended up leaving soon after my brother had called me.

I'll admit that this was a mistake on my part.  I shouldn't have had him sleep over when I couldn't really attend to him when I woke up.

I talked to my step brother about it and my brother told me that I'm not allowed to have sex in the house or have guys sleep over overnight.  I didn't really agree but I just said if I have friends sleep over, from this point on I'll only have them stay if I'm going to be home in the morning as well.  My step sister didn't really know any of this had happened, and I was worried for her to find out.  My brother told me that he would promise not to tell my sister about it if I didn't have someone over again.  He had told me if my sister found out she would get super mad and that she would tell our parents.  

I just kinda brushed it off because he was being a little dramatic in my opinion.

My sister owns the house that we all live in so she makes all the rules basically.  The only thing I was worried about was making her uncomfortable in her house.  

My brother does not have a job or pay rent.  He goes to bed at 4am and wakes up at around 2 or 3 pm.  He relies on his Gf for food and gas money, and she pays half the rent that she is supposed to because she is tight on money.

I ended up talking to my sister about it because she found out about it through my brothers gf.  She told me that since I pay for my room, I can do what I want to in there.  She said that if I wanted to fuck 10 guys in there at the same time she wouldn't care (her words haha).  She also told me that if I wanted to have my friends sleep over that I could.  

So this past weekend I had a guy friend over that I am just friends with. 

It was late on Saturday night and my friend lives about an hour away, so I offered for him to stay at my place in my room for the night.  (Plus we were both drunk and I didn't want him driving) I'll call him M.

My brother has always been a little bit stand off ish toward my guy friends because he thinks every guy that I hang out with I'm having sex with.  So he wasn't happy that I was hanging out with M in general.

I asked my sister if M could sleep over and she said okay.  She told me to send a group text with my brother, his gf, and my sister in it and let everyone know that M was sleeping over.  

My sister was the first to respond with a ""k cool :)"".  My sister gf who I have never talked to about any of this said ""I thought we agreed no boys sleeping in the bedroom."" and my sister responded with ""What? No..? its her room and her friend.""

My brothers gf went on to say that her and my brother had talked about it and they agreed that I wasn't allowed to have guys sleep over.  

At around 2 in the morning my brother knocked on my door.  My friend was passed out next to me with his own blanket completely not touching me.  I was just on my computer reading reddit (haha).

My brother said we needed to go for a drive, I said okay.  I was still really drunk and I don't remember much about what my brother said.  He basically told me what I was doing wasn't okay.

I had M sleep over anyways to kinda prove a point to my brother. (just wanna say again we did nothing romantic)

Also my brother had 2 friends over already and they were both in the living room on the couch. 

The rest of the weekend neither my brother or my brothers gf would make eye contact or acknowledge me.

I ended up having to text my brother to ask him why this is such a huge deal to him.  He told me I don't respect him as a person because I broke a promise to him.  He said that he doesn't even care that people are sleeping over in my room, it was the ""promise"" that I broke that bothered him.

The promise that he is referring to is him not telling my sister about B sleeping over that one time if I didn't have another guy sleep over again.

I told my brother that our sister knew so there is no promise to keep.  He wouldn't acknowledge that and kept going on and on about the promise. 

I told him about how I felt about his friends sleeping over (one of his friends will stay over for 5 days at a time, which I'm not happy about but I don't say much about it), and that him and his gf share a bed and live together.  He brushed that off.  

I also said that he doesn't really have the right to tell me what I can do with my room.  I pay for my space.  He does not.  He said that since it makes him uncomfortable that I have sex in my room it becomes a house problem and he has a right to say something about it.

He then called me selfish and self centered and said that all I do is fuck guys, get drunk, and smoke.  (All of which I really don't do often).  He then said that this house isn't like a dorm and I shouldn't treat it like one.  He said that I don't respect him at all. He also said that I snaked behind his back by asking my sister what she thought about guys sleeping over.  

I got irritated and told him if he's going to attack me like that I can say that its not okay to not have a job and play computer 90% of the time.  Again he didn't acknowledge that I said that.

Its just sucking a lot because I work with my sister and my brothers gf.  My brothers gf wont talk to me at work, and we need to talk to get work done.  She told me it was low of me to tell my brother that he doesn't have a job (???) 

I texted everyone and told them we need to have a house meeting tonight.  I'm really not sure what to do because I've tried to talk to them but my brother told me ""he's done being an older brother"" and that ""it doesn't matter anymore"".

I'm just not sure what to say anymore because my brother keeps telling me what I'm doing ""wrong"", but says its different for his situation and its okay for him to do it.

For the record I think I'm a pretty good roommate otherwise.  I clean my messes in the shared space and clean up things that aren't even mine.  I'm not loud and try and be nice in general.  

This is the only issue my brother and I have ever had.

"Me (f22) with my neighbors(mf20's?): they saved my cat, how do I thank them?


My neighbors and myself are all in our 20's. We've never spoken to each other. 

Today, my cat was chased up a tall tree by two giant dogs. Kitty was not coming down anytime soon and was yowling to wake the dead. Dogs got chased away, but I couldn't get to my cat. 

In come my two neighbors, and one of them climbs a tall fence and spends the next ten minutes nudging my cat down the tree, getting very scratched up for his efforts. 

I was thanking them profusely during, and afterwards as well, as well as apologizing for his injuries and all the trouble. He said no biggie. 

But I'm the type of person that carries around a lot of guilt. Right now I'm feeling very guilty for letting my cats out and for all that mess with the rescue. I want to bake them something, or buy them nice chocolates, or something like that. 

I need advice from y'all. Is that over kill or a kind gesture? 

**Edit**: Thank you all for some wonderful suggestions! Some of them were really cute, and if I had the confidence to do them, I would. Instead I opted to keep it simple and bake them cookie-brownies. They were delivered with a lot of gratitude. Again, thanks to all! Internet cookie-brownies for everyone!

"Me [45 M] with my __wife_ [42 F] duration, found out she was cheating on me. 22 year marriage.


[removed]"
"Me [25F] with my fiance [25M] dating 6 years, engaged 6 months, his mother is still on his bank account.


My fiance still has the same bank account he had in high school.  The bank says there is no way to remove his mother from it without her written consent or her being the one to do so,  even though he is no longer a minor.  In a normal family,  maybe all he would need to do is ask his mother to do that,  but his mother is crazy.  

Like,  actually mentally unstable.  Which is a large part of the reason I want her off the accounts.  He has our joint account and two credit cards linked to that account (his personal,  and our joint),  and I'm afraid that if she went off the deep end,  she could do some serious damage. 

He gets annoyed whenever I bring it up,  because it would be ""a hassle"" to close that account and transfer the money to a new account,  re-set up auto debits for certain bills (though the only bill he pays on his own is his car payments and the insurance on my engagement ring which is due yearly,  everything else we pay jointly). 

I am worried about her name still being on that account for two reasons.  First,  I don't trust her not to decide we have somehow wronged her and that she is entitled to all of our money, or to take money from us to ""punish us"" (she used to do this with personal belongings when we briefly lived with her a few years ago,  I wouldn't put anything past her).  Also,  in the unthinkable event that anything happens to him,  she gets any of that money as the other person on the account.  That sounds petty,  but if we have kids in the future and I need that money to support them? Or cover other costs? I don't trust his mother to give it to me. 

Fiance says I'm making too big a deal out of this and it would be an unthinkable hassle to open a new account.  He seems to conveniently forget that I had to do this when I moved to our current city because my old bank doesn't exist down here.  
It wasn't that much of a hassle.  You get your new info,  you enter it everywhere you have auto debits,  you transfer all the money over and you close the old account.  

I think he's being immature and lazy about this and I feel like he's not taking our future financial security seriously.  Am I making too big of a deal of this?

"Me [26/F] with husband [28/M] married 1 year, he's changed his mind on kids and I don't know if this should be a deal breaker


Before we got married I was fully honest about the fact that I wanted kids and he told me he wanted to have kids with me. He already has a 5 year old with someone else. Well after we got married I got pregnant and we both decided it was just terrible timing due to financial and relationship issues we were having, so I went through with an abortion. Even then he told me we would try again once we got in a better spot. We're still not in any position to bring another life into this world but last night he dropped the bomb on me that he didn't want any more kids, and that I pretty much had to agree that our relationship was going to be childless. It was a surprise given the fact that he previously said he did want more kids. Now he's saying he didn't even want kids when he had the first one and he definitely doesn't want any more. I don't know what to do, I'm angry he lied to me before marriage and now we're married he has different wants. Had I known this before I wouldn't have married him. Is this a deal breaker or am I supposed to just accept this?

Tl;dr husband changed his stance on wanting kids and I'm not sure if it should be a deal breaker. "
"I (27F) asked my mom (63F) not to post my medical status on Facebook and she was offended. Now all her friends expect updates.


I'm and American and was injured in an accident in a foreign country. Luckily I was in a country with great health care and my problems were addressed well and very quickly. My mom is very religious and posted several very detailed posts asking for prayers. Her description of my injuries was also very exaggerated, although I don't even know the full extent yet. The thread received a flood of ridiculous comments mostly from people I don't even know. 

$nbsp;

When I talked to her about it and said I didn't like the posts being so detailed, she was very stubborn and short with me dropping comments like ""call me after you see your doctor; I won't put it on Facebook."" Now all her friends keep asking for updates, even though I haven't even seen my own doctor yet. My question is - am I out of line with this request and should I let my mom interact with her friends how ever she wants?

tldr: mom talking openly and inaccurately about my injuries on Facebook and doesn't like my request for her to stop

"Me (21F) with a guy I met online (26M). He said something alarming. Should I cut it off?


Hopefully you can provide me with some advice. I've been talking with this guy from POF for a few weeks now. He seemed like a good match for me up until this evening. 

Necessary context: I am a recovering addict. This is my first attempt at dating since I've been in recovery, so I wasn't sure when I should bring this up to him. He knows I am in drug court for pot possession and that I go to recovery meetings. I intended to tell him I am an addict when we met for the first time. (we haven't met yet)

After telling him I was at a step workshop all day, he asked me if it was for drug court or if I have a legitamate problem. I told him the truth, and he asked a few harmless questions--how long I'd been clean, what I used, if I'd ever relapsed etc. I answered truthfully. Then he hit me with this: 

""Okay good, thank you for telling me. I'm glad you have. As long as you know if we take our relationship to the next level I will not tolerate any using or hanging around users specially men. Also if we go to the next level I will expect full honesty about everything. *We can play it by ear but it might be worth considering our relationship being strict dominate so that your behaviors don't get out of line and if they do I can address them.*""

The last part is what really screams ""red flag"" to me. I told him he sounded controlling and that I was offended. He apologized saying that wasn't the best wording and told me to forget it. 

I guess what I'm asking is, is this an appropriate response? Could he just be clueless about addiction and think answering to him would help me stay sober, or is this guy a controlling nut job? Should I continue and see how it progresses (on high alert for other red flags), or should I just dip now? 

**TL;DR** guy I'm interested in said something controlling. Should I see how it goes or dip now? "
"My [29 F] best friend [29 F] asked me if I dislike her husband [34 M] and I don't want to lie. Help me decide what to say?


If you check my history, you can see how I've outlined why I dislike my friend's husband. But the TLDR is: My best friend (Laura)'s husband is a shitty life partner. He is selfish and extremely annoying. He won't offer to help, and if asked he'll agree and then disappear when you need help. When Laura cooks, she can't put food on the table or he'll eat it all without her getting any. He enjoys bugging her and thinks it's amusing to annoy her. He says awkward sexual jokes. He repeats questions 5 times in a row, even after having been answered. His parents are crazy with his mom being a hoarder and dad an actual creep who makes Laura uncomfortable. She argues that her husband is like this because of his parents upbringing and I feel, while they may be the cause, he has a responsibility to realize these issues and work on them.

Since the previous post, I've carried on internalizing my annoyance for her husband (Tom [34 M]). I still try to see the positive in him, and I think he's growing on me, but this goes back and forth depending on his behaviour.

Married for a few months now, their marriage is already rocky and Laura is now going to therapy alone for her stress levels. Tom's driving her crazy and while I don't think he's the only cause of her stress, him and his family are about 90% of it. 

Recently she sort of broke down in text to us (myself and our mutual friend, Mia [29 F]) telling us how they're fighting over him bugging her so much. With her therapist pointing out that Tom is childlike, Laura told us he was immature and she wasn't sure he was ready for marriage. We met with her and reiterated what she said in the text to us and told her we agreed. I suggested ways to combat his annoying behaviour, like asking him what he's feeling when he won't stop ""poking her"" (it's something different, but I'll say he pokes her as a replacement for what he does). Or getting him a stress ball. It felt productive and while we did bring up what she said on her text and agreed with what was said, everything seemed fine.

So our friend Mia has recently gotten into a very serious relationship with someone from Tom's friend group. Mia's guy is great and my spouse and him get along very well. Since Mia has a guy now, us 3 couples do a ton together. In the beginning, Laura mentioned how me and her didn't really double date, but now Mia has a guy, I seem to want triple dates. In the past, we HAVE gone on a couple of double dates with Laura and Tom, but there is something to be said for all 3 best friends having spouses finally and being together as a big group. Before Mia dated her guy, she said she wanted a guy like mine.. which basically meant a light hearted nice person because all her past guys have been abusive. So now that she's with someone great, we talk so fondly about him and how him and my guy are so cute together. They have things in common, they'll jokingly pose together for photos. You can see a good friendship blossoming between them, and I love this since my spouse doesn't have friends and it makes him sad. The problem is my guy also can't stand Tom and doesn't click with him. Hanging out in a group is fine, hanging out in a guy group is fine, but he doesn't want one on one with Tom. My guy and Mia's guy haven't even hung out one on one YET, but Laura is noticing and is already upset.

Well this all came to head when I was chatting with the girls about how my spouse was sad and needs to make effort for friends if he wants them. Mia says ""well, he did text my guy recently"" and I said ""oh? That's good"". And then Laura says ""y'know, Tom is around too!"".

I go back to talking about my guy's situation and don't acknowledge Laura's comment to avoid saying anything. Mia says ""oh, Tom's schedule is tough"" (I'm not sure why she said that). Laura then straight up says she fears we don't like Tom, and I don't know how to respond to that. We have kept our rants to ourselves, but she's picked up on things that I don't think we can filter. Or were we not careful and being rude? I think it really just comes down to our guys clicking and me not pushing my guy to be friend with Tom (which I shouldn't have to do).

I don't want to lie. Even if I wanted to lie for the sake of our relationship, it would be like saying ""no, that's all in your head"", and it's not. But I do NOT want to lose her friendship. I need to be tactful in my response. Mia responded very tactfully, but she did say ""I don't think he's good enough for our best friend"" and my sister says that's terrible to say and my spouse says if we say that we will lose her. What do I say to not lie, but also keep her friendship and be tactful?

**TLDR: My best friend's husband is a shitty partner and is driving her insane. She complains about him and wants advice, so we discuss it. But she sees my spouse and our mutual friend's spouse are becoming friends and that, (coupled with us agreeing with her complaints about her husband?) have made her realize we don't like her husband. How do I avoid lying but also not ruin our friendship?**
