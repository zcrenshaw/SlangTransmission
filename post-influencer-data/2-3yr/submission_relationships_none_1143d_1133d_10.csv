First of all I want to say thank you to everyone who contributed to my last post. I never expected it to blow up the way it did and get that many replies. After a while the number of responses got overwhelming and I was unable to reply to many of the later posts and/or questions. 

I do wanna clarify a few things which kept coming up in the last post. This situation for me has absolutely nothing to do with ""gender expectations"" or anything like that, that's just not who I am. I suppose I should have expected that response from this sub given so many of the posts are about cheating, abusive partners or people confused with gender stereotypes etc. 

With that out of the way I also should have clarified in my OP that I am not a big gift receiver in general. I feel uncomfortable even when my parents, friends or other family members splurge on me. I also want to point out that people kept on bringing up scaling of money in that $200 for me has the same value that 5k has for her. Yes, that's fine in theory but it can still be hard to comprehend in real life when I have never had that kind of money splurged on me or lived such a high class lifestyle. It's easier said than done when people were urging me to accept her proposal with grace. 

Anyway, here goes the actual update:
----------------------------------------------------------
Before posting my last post I had already decided that I was going to turn her down and I wanted to get advice on how to politely turn her down. After listening to the good people of this sub I opened my mind a little and decided to have a talk with her about our relationship, her money, and our finances moving forward with an open mind. 

She came over last night after work and we talked about her proposal. I told her I was incredibly thankful for her offer but in all honestly it did make me uncomfortable. I explained to her that it was because of my middle class background and the fact that I am not a big gift receiver in general. She cut me off right then and there and said she was sorry if she felt me uncomfortable and she was only coming from a good place. She revealed to me that growing up even she had feelings similar to mine because she viewed everything as her ""family's money"" and only after she matured later on in life did she start to not feel bad about her wealth and privilege, and simply starting enjoying it for what it is. She told me she has a standing offer from her father to work a cushy job in the family business but she still does understand the value of money and that's why she still works on her own. We then talked about her family's wealth and the impact it had on her past relationships. She told me that usually she's never offered to do something this big for anyone else but she only offered this because she really trusts me, respects me and has fallen for me hard. She mentioned that in her last relationship she kept everything 50-50 because she wasn't sure about the guy and their relationship got very toxic by the end because he simply expected her to pay for everything. She said she loves my ambition and wants me to  keep progressing in my career. 

All that being said, I asked her what it would mean for our relationship going forward if I accepted. We both decided that nothing changes, we keep on splitting it 50-50 as we have so far. She joked that she wouldn't let me off the hook for future dates/expenses this easily lol. For any future trips/activities we decided that we won't always go for the most expensive options or the most budget friendly ones and try to find more of a middle ground. 

Ultimately she insisted that because she had already made the offer I had to accept. I did with the compromise being that once we are there we are going to split everything else 50-50, she will let me treat her a few times, and we won't be splurging the way she is used to on vacations. 

I am really thankful that his happened and we both feel closer than ever. She will be coming over on Friday to spend the weekend with me and plan/book this trip. I couldn't be happier right now. 

**tl;dr: She came over, we talked about the money and the state of our relationship. I accepted her offer and we both feel a lot closer.** "

"UPDATE! Me (22F) with my boyfriend (26M) of 2 years; he's against the idea of getting a pet but I'm lonely and my job is stressful.


ORIGINAL: [reddit!]https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4u46o4/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_hes/

My first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I figured I'd update anyway, as it's a happy one.

The TL;DR of my last post was that, after recently moving cities and experiencing a lifestyle change (boyfriend started working 80-100 hours/week) I was feeling stressed out and drained from my job, which involves animal research, and thought that getting a pet would really help me (as it has in the past). Since we really don't have time for a dog, I wanted to get a cat, and while he initially agreed to it, my boyfriend sat me down 8 months ago and reiterated that he wasn't super into cats and that since I seemed to be adapting well if I would hold off on getting one. Since then, my mental health has gone down a little and I wanted advice on how to talk to him about it.

Firstly, I got a couple of PMs and comments telling me that my boyfriend doesn't have to work that much and that I shouldn't be okay with it. This is a little naive, people. Everyone that has his position works as much as he does and he loves his job, so he needs to put up with the hours for about 5 years until he's moved up the chain of command. So that's not really up for discussion and never has been. He loves his job and feels fulfilled at work, which is something I want for him.


ONTO THE UPDATE...


I got a lot (a looot) of comments that sort of told me off for wanting to make a plea for a pet that my boyfriend wasn't on board with so I initially decided not to broach the topic and keep it to myself. 

However, I guess I was closer to my breaking point than I realized because the next night when he got in at midnight, after having a long and stressful day that had put me in a bad headspace for the evening (even after going for a 5k run and lifting some weights) I just sort of had a breakdown in his arms. He was flabbergasted and worried and asked me what was wrong.

I sort of... snotted, hiccoughed, and cried as I told him that I felt really lonely and was upset that he'd asked me to hold off on the cat, that I was very sad that I interacted only with animals that hate me and that I can't get attached to all day, and that my colleagues find that their pets ground them; that I couldn't continue coming home to an empty house and that pets were really important to me.

He was very shocked to hear all of this, stroked my hair for a while, made me tea, ran me a bath, and said we'd have a serious talk when I got back from my conference (monday &amp; tuesday). I was a little put off by the fact that he wasn't talking about it right away (but understanding because by the time we got to bed it was probably 2am).

I was at my conference until last night, but when I got in at around 8PM, I was surprised that our condo door was open--my boyfriend was home (never happens)! I was even more surprised when he came to the door, grinning, with a big Maine Coon cat in his arms that I'm very familiar with--my childhood kitty that lives with my parents. 

Well, I was pretty much a mess after that, happy and sobbing all over Snuffles (Snuffles rather frantically twisting his body in 1000 bizarre ways trying to get away and thereby avoid salty tears and snot), and my boyfriend explained: we were ""borrowing"" Snuffles for the next 7 weeks from my parents. He then said with an even bigger grin that he was serving as my cat ""in the interim of waiting for your new Abyssinian kitten to age to 10 weeks, at which point we'll give Snuffles back and bring in the kitten.""

My heart was so full. I was surprised that he remembered my brief mention that I thought that an Abyssinian would be a good breed fit for us (not super vocal, very friendly, short hair, indoor cat). I definitely never expected him to pay for the cat or anything, but he has put a deposit down and I will go pick a kitten from the breeder's litter in the next couple of weeks!!

I asked him what had made him change his mind the full 180 degrees and he just sort of explained that he was only ever ""sort of"" against the cat and thought I had been doing just fine mentally, so I didn't need one, and just figured we'd get a dog once we'd moved out of the city centre in 5 years or so, once both of us have reduced our hours.

He also is still a little bit concerned that a cat isn't going to be a fix-all, so I made an appointment with a psychologist I used to see and will be driving to my hometown next week for a ""check in"" with her. 

I thought he didn't want a cat because his dad thinks they're an ""unmanly"" pet, so I asked him as much, and he rolled his eyes and said ""Look, the CEO of Snapchat can't even find a hotter partner than I can and he definitely isn't dating someone that is getting a PhD. There's literally nothing in the world that is a threat to my manliness"" 

Also, just like I thought (because I know my boyfriend well, not just a ""magical rationalization"" I ""made up just because [I] want a cat""), this morning I woke up to my boyfriend spooning Snuffles instead of me; he'll be fine having a cat. 



**tl;dr**: we good, he wasn't actually really against getting a cat, so we're getting a kitten, and in the meantime I get to hang out with my old buddy."
"[UPDATE] I [16 M] went to the movies with a girl [16 F]. She kissed me afterwards and I froze.


[Link to OP.](https://redd.it/4vaiwq)

TL;DR: I went to the movies with a girl, she kissed me, I froze, we haven't talked since.

---
My original post didn't get much attention, but a lot has happened since I made that last post so I figured I'd update. I took the advice of reaching out to her again and I invited her to the movies again (I go there a lot lol). We met up at the theater and we talked about our previous date.

Me: ""So... sorry about not talking to you for a few days.""

Her: ""It's cool.""

Me: ""Yeah... I was just kind of caught off guard by the kiss. Not that I disliked it, uh, I was just kind of surprised and I wasn't expecting it because I've never been kissed before. I mean, uh, I've been kissed by like my grandma and stuff-""

At this point in my awkward ramble, she starts laughing. ""You are so funny.""

We stood there in silence for a second. I decided to break the silence.

""You know, it wasn't a *bad* kiss. I was just kinda caught off guard. I mean, I don't really have the authority to judge kisses, considering I've only had the one-""

And she cut me off and kissed me. Except this time, it was reciprocated. We stopped kissing and she looked at me and said, ""Two.""

So yeah, I guess I have a girlfriend now.

Edit: for people picturing me as Michael Cera, imagine him crossed with Tobey Maguire from the first 20 minutes of Spider-Man.

"UPDATE: My best friend [25F] has been ignoring me for a year and now wants me [25F] to give her fiance a job.


Thank you all for the dozens of helpful comments and messages. Here's the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4v35ti/my_best_friend_25f_has_been_ignoring_me_for_a/



I called Sarah's home phone the morning after I got her message. Her mom answered and told me she was out with Joe. We chatted for a few minutes, and.then she suddenly started crying. She told me she feels like she's lost her daughter. She said she would ask Sarah to call me. I didn't get a call back. 


The next day I got a surprise visit from Lily, who Sarah and I were really good friends with in college. Lily and I had fallen out of touch and I was really excited to see her again. That night I took her to a party. An actor that Sarah always liked was there, and Lily ended up hitting it off with him and posting a picture of the three of us doing shots on Facebook. 


That night I got a text from Sarah saying, ""Since when do you hang out with (actor)?"" I was extremely annoyed and didn't respond. An hour later she texted ""I guess you're too much of a celebrity to respond.""


I spent about an hour ranting to poor Lily, and then composed an email to Sarah. I think I kept it pretty unemotional. Basically, I told her that she had really hurt me by cutting me out of her life, and I didn't think it was fair for her to suddenly reappear with no explanation or apology. I also said that I think her relationship with Joe is toxic and that I hope she overcomes her fear of being alone so that she can stop jumping into unhealthy relationships. Finally I told her that both her mother and I are worried about her, but I don't have the time or emotional energy to keep trying anymore. If she wants to get in touch when she's fixed her personal issues, I'll be open to listening. Until then, we're not friends anymore. 



I'm upset, I'm tired, but mostly I'm done. I hope I made the right decision.

"My fiance [27f] is a ""people pleaser"". It's causing problems and I'm [30m] thinking about calling off the wedding.


I've been with my fiance for 3 years, 8 months engaged. We've had our ups and downs, but for the most part things have been pretty great, until she moved in 6 months ago. We've been combining our lifestyles and finances, basically easing into merging our lives together.

The problem is she's a ""people pleaser"", in her own words. She's been in therapy for 6 years, and I guess I never knew how bad it was until moving in with her, a lot of which she's hidden from me. I don't want this to get too long, so here's some of the highlights in no particular order:

* She recently was promoted into accounts payable at her company and realized she is the lowest paid person on payroll. She didn't negotiate a good starting wage, and has never asked for a raise, or had one, despite multiple promotions.

* She inherited a car a few months ago and sold it. She had offers online from $18k-$25k, but sold it to the first person who showed up for $10k.

* She caught someone stealing her bike at college. The woman stealing the bike managed to convince my fiance that it was actually her bike and my fiance just let her take it, despite the fact that she caught the woman cutting her bike lock.

* Last spring was my 30th birthday and she ordered a giant chocolate cake for the party. The cake normally comes with nuts, but given my allergy for nuts she ordered it without them. Well when she went to pick it up and it had nuts on it, she just paid for it and brought it home. I couldn't even be in the same room as the cake.

Which brings us to tomorrow. My father recently passed away and I need to fly to the other end of the country to get things sorted out with family, attend the funeral, etc.. Meanwhile, we recently had a pipe burst in our home, and the contractors will be out tomorrow to fix it. My flight's at 6am and my fiance will have to handle it, including all the negotiations because we don't know the extent of the damages.

I've been giving it a lot of thought and I just don't trust my fiance to handle it. And if I can't trust or rely on her to do something like this, how can we really be life partners? I mean I trust that she is always looking out for me, and has my best interest at heart, but I can't trust her to get things done.

We've talked about it a few times before, but it's been unproductive. She's convinced she's just being nice and doesn't like confrontation, then brings up examples of extremely confrontational people. I think she puts her aversion to conflict above her/our long term goals, and she needs to find a happy medium. She doesn't understand how negatively this is impacting her life.

But at the same time, we've had some amazing years together and she really is a great person. We're compatible in almost every other way. So is this over like I think it is? Is there any way I can get through to her? Should I tell her I'm thinking about leaving?

tl;dr: Fiance is a self-described ""people pleaser"", it's caused her to make a lot of terrible mistakes and I'm thinking about leaving her."
"[UPDATE] My (23F) SO (22M) of 6 months is mad because I've asked him to contribute to my grocery bill.


First of all, I'd like to thank every single one of you who read my post and helped me - I never expected for it to blow up! 

Now onto the update:

After I made the [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4pti4v/my_23f_so_22m_of_6_months_is_mad_because_ive/) everything was calm for a while. I've told him that I feel disrespected when he leaves everything lying around without cleaning it and also told him that I feel the same when he just eats all of my food without buying new stuff. He said he understood, apologized for overreacting and everything was fine! 

We had a small falling out because he threw a small chunk of meat on my rug by accident (it's one of those shaggy ones where you end up searching for stuff for hours) and I told him to pick it up immediately for the above mentioned reason and he refused to. He apologized and picked it up after he finished his meal. 

He also talked with me about his feelings and told me that he fears he might be depressed. We had a long talk about it and how he's always feeling exhausted, I suggested maybe just picking up running again because he absolutely loved it before. He did! It apparently even helped for a little while, but after 1 1/2 weeks he stopped doing that, too. 

We also talked about our vacation and he said he just couldn't afford it. He did go out with his friends a lot more, though. 

Which is kind of the reason I'm writing this right now, he never introduced me to his friends in our city. I have met every single friend of his in his hometown. 

I've met two of his friends in our city once, but that's it. The first time I've asked to get to know them or meet them was back in February, he always claimed they were busy and if they did go out somewhere it was ""just the people from our study group, sorry!"". I've listened to this for the past 4ish months. There is also a very attractive girl in his study group.

When I asked him if he wanted to go out today, he said he'd think about it. We haven't seen each other a lot lately since he's always studying or grabbing a beer with his study group. He promised me a few weeks ago that he didn't have to study as much anymore and that we'd have more time to go out and enjoy our time together. Hasn't happened yet. 

Twenty minutes later, while I was leaving to go grocery shopping, he said that he already had plans with his study group. He said that he waited to tell me until I had to leave because he ""didn't want me to annoy him"".

When I asked him who was going, he said ""John and the others"". I asked who ""the others"" were, turns out the attractive girl is joining them. I asked if I could join, since he's been promising me I'd get to meet them for the past 4 months. He said that I'm always asking (first time today) and that he doesn't want me to meet them today and besides, why do I always have to annoy him with my questions? 

I've calmly told him that I have never asked before if he could ask his group whether or not I could join and I'm just curious since he's spending a lot of time with them (up to 30 hours for studying, the occasional beer afterwards) and he's been promising for the fucking past 4 months. I've also told him that I wanted to get to know them because he apparently liked them, he refers to them as his friends even though he never truly talks about some of them in great detail. I bet you all can guess which one he doesn't talk about. 

A lot more stuff was said, but in the end we broke up because I said I wanted to know why he didn't want me to meet his friends and he couldn't come up with a good reason apart from ""Why do you need to?"". What the fuck?

Thank you guys for all your help. It's just been an hour since we broke up and I fear this post is a mess. I've already been doubting my decision to break up, which is why I came back and read all of your comments on the original post. 

TL;DR: Was close to breaking up after the original post but everything was calm for a while (probably because we haven't seen each other a lot?), broke up for unrelated reasons. "
"My sister [23F] is causing a scene because I [28F] am skipping her wedding in favor of my sister-in-law's [29F] wedding. I don't know what to do.


I've been married to my husband for a year now, we dated for 3 years for that. His sister (my SIL) and I are pretty good friends. 9 months ago she got engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I happily accepted. She sent out invitations about a month later, inviting me and my husband (obviously), as well as my parents. My parents also said they would be attending. The wedding is set to be towards the end of August, so not long from now.

Well, about a month ago, my little sister got engaged, too. For the record, my sister and I have never been incredibly close. And I personally think she is far too young to be getting married, but I told her I was happy for her and fully plan on being supportive. 

That is, until I found out when the wedding was. August, literally the day before my SIL's wedding. To be clear, my SIL, my husband, and I live on the west coast. My sister and my parents live in Florida. So I could either bail on my SIL, who I said I would be in her wedding months ago, or I could go to my sister's wedding, where I'm not even in the bridal party and didn't know when her wedding was until about a week ago. Not only would airfare be pretty expensive at this point, there is no way I can be at both. Plus, my SIL's wedding is going to be this whole big thing, whereas my sister's is a small backyard wedding. 

I don't know what to do. I think my sister is being very selfish, especially considering she knew when my SIL's wedding was. But she's causing a big uproar over it and my parents are kind of torn on the issue, too. Do I bail on my SIL and go to my sister's wedding? Or do I skip it and do what I promised I would months ago? I know it's my sister...but she's kind of pissing me off with all of this and acting like a brat What do I do?

"My [32F] Minister husband [37M] had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she got pregnant. I have filed for divorce but people from the town/church still treat me like I'm the Minister's wife and won't listen when I nicely tell them to stop


This is my first time posting here but I would greatly appreciate some insight into my situation from people who are outside of it. I [32F] have been married to my Minister husband [37M] for 7 years when I found out that he had been having an affair with a member of his congregation [35F] and she has become pregnant. Despite his words and begging me to forgive him I have chosen to file for divorce. It was difficult because I had been married to him for so long, 7 years, and we had a 2 year courtship before we were married. He has been in my life a long time but despite him asking I could not forget the affair. He now lives with the woman he had an affair with and their child and he was removed from his job as the Minister once the affair became public. I am renting a townhouse and am working a full time job now.

The problem I am having is that many of the people in the town and in the church still see me as the Minister's wife. My husband was the Minister for 5 years and I often prayed with and supported people during difficult times, such as during the sickness or death of a loved one or during marital difficulties. Even though I have filed for divorce and am no long living with my husband, these people are still asking me to carry out these duties. I do care for these people but because I am now working full time I no longer have the time that I used to. It doesn't help that the Minister who replaced my husband is unmarried and there is no wife for them to go to in my place. I do not mind attending the odd charitable event in my spare time or visiting occasionally to have tea or pray but I cannot do this all the time like I used to. The people from the town and the church have been nothing but kind to me from the outset of this instead of encouraging me to stay with my husband, and I truly do not believe they are doing this out of malice, but I don't know what else I can do. I have gently reminded them that I am no longer the Minister's wife but they either don't listen or say things like ""I don't mind dear"". I don't want to be angry, rude or forceful because as I said they are not doing it because they are bad people. I believe they are just so used to me doing it that it's comfort for them. How can I can I kindly, gently and nicely get them to stop treating me like I am the Minister's wife? Thank you everyone for your time.

tl;dr summary: My [32F] husband [37M] was the Minister of the church for five years until he was removed because he had an affair with a member of his congregation [35F]. I have filed for divorce and the church has a new (unmarried) Minister. People still ask me to do the things I did when I was the Minister’s wife (such as charitable endeavors, visiting their sick loved ones etc.) and even though they are not malicious they don’t listen when I say no or ask them to stop, I think because they are so used to it and the new Minister is unmarried. That’s the summary of my situation."
"[UPDATE] My half-sister [14 F] has said she'd like to change her last name to my father's [38 M]


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nkrz3/my_halfsister_14_f_has_said_shed_like_to_change/)

So quite a bit happened since the original thread. 

But let me first answer a question from the last thread that I didn't see until I logged in right now: 

&gt;So, does she have her mum's last name at the moment or the errant father's?

Her father's. Mom thought that somewhere down the line she might reconnect with her father and figured having his last name could help her with that. And if not, she could easily change it if she wished to do so.

Anyway, both me and my sister got quite the bomb dropped on us after we brought up the last name change to our mom. Turns out our parents are dating! They've actually been dating for the past year and we just never really caught onto it. I feel so clueless, but looking back, yeah, the signs were there. They didn't want to tell us anything because they were afraid what might happen if they broke it off too prematurely. So yeah, that happened. It's really weird. But also really great! 

Amanda pretty much still can't stop smiling whenever she sees our dad and absolutely loves that she can call him that to his face now. And in regards to the name change, yeah, our parents are more than fine with it, and our dad actually cried a bit when Amanda asked him if he wouldn't mind her doing that. It was a really emotional moment for us all.

"My [31M] girlfriend [31F] of one year cut off her family after her husband [32M] got her sister pregnant and everyone supported the sister [27F] and ex. How do I make her feel good and make her feel welcomed into my life and family?


My [31M] girlfriend [31F] and I will be celebrating the one year anniversary of the day we met and had our first date on Monday. I am divorced. I was with my ex-wife [31F] for 10 years (dated for 2 and married for 8) and my divorce was finalized 2 years ago, a year before I met my girlfriend. I filed for divorce because my ex-wife had cheated with someone she worked with [30s?M] 

My girlfriend [31F] is also divorced. She was also with her ex-husband [32M] for 10 years (dated for 3 and married for 7) and her divorce was also finalized a year before we met. My girlfriend filed for divorce because her ex-husband cheated with my wife’s younger sister [27F] and her sister got pregnant. When it came out that this happened, my girlfriend’s parents [50s?M&amp;F] and the rest of her family supported her sister and told my girlfriend she was overreacting (I’ve seen copies of the court transcript from her divorce so I know my girlfriend is not lying). They threw her sister a baby shower and were upset that my girlfriend didn’t attend and they chipped in to pay for her husband’s divorce lawyer. Her sister also moved in with her ex-husband after my girlfriend moved out of the house and had to buy her out of her half as part of the divorce settlement. Her mom told her they had edited her out of all the family pictures and ripped up the rest. My girlfriend cut contact and hasn’t seen, spoken or had contact with any person from either side of her family since she got divorced a year ago.

My girlfriend has moved on. She moved across the state, has a house, a new job and new friends and she was adopted by her mentor from in the military reserves so she could be legally severed from her parents. I have a great relationship with my family and they all supported me through my divorce. I can’t imagine how it must have felt to not have family support during that time. They didn’t even want her to divorce him and said the sister could just live in their basement and my girlfriend had to live in a hotel for a year when she filed and moved out because no one would take her in. Over the year we have been together my girlfriend has told me the story but I haven’t pushed her because it’s so painful obviously. She has her mentor, her friends from the military and her new friends but I get that it’s not completely the same. My parents [61M/56F] have met my girlfriend once now and soon my brothers [33/32M] and the rest of my family will be meeting her. With my girlfriend’s permission I have shared the gist of her story (not the details) with my parents and brothers. My parents loved her and I know my family wants her to feel as loved and welcome as possible. I want the same thing for her and I want to support her as much as I can. I love her but I’m a bit emotionally and feeling challenged and I’m not always the best with showing emotions and talking about stuff. It probably seems obvious to other people but I am unsure.

My questions are 1) What are some ways I can be supportive of my girlfriend as she keeps building her new life without her family and gets over the divorce? 2) What are things for me not to do? 3) My mom and dad and family want to make her feel welcome in the family but I have no clue how they can without doing it wrong.
tl;dr My girlfriend cut off contact with her family because they supported her sister and her ex-husband when her ex-husband got her sister pregnant. I want to support her and make her feel welcome in my family but I don’t know how and I don’t want to mess this up or hurt her by doing it wrong."

So, I met John ten years ago, and we got married six years ago.  He's wonderful, kind, loving, and funny. You wouldn't know otherwise that he's had a tragic past.

He got married to his sweetheart back in his home country, and was married to her for 15 years.  His country was torn apart by war, and it made the news at the time, until everyone forgot about it.  During this time, he lost his wife and first born daughter in a wartime casualty that both shocking and horrific. According to his surviving daughter, he has always been kind and strong, even when things got this bad.  She's living in another country, so she's not in our life much as a grown woman with her own life (she's an artist, so sweet), but she seems like her father.  John moved to our country about 12 years ago, shortly before I met him.  I found him amazing with bright eyes and stupid jokes that are also kind of endearing.  After a few years of courtship, we got married.  

My family has never been fond of him.  Partly due to our age difference, but also because he's a foreigner, although they won't admit it, and mask it under other things they think to pick on him about.  They correct his accent, make his hobbies (wood crafting, gardening) look un-masculine, and generally ""ehm ehm"" correct him when he says something wrong (usually mispronouncing words or making a malapropism) like he's a small child.  They don't care that he's gainfully employed with a good job as a teacher (now with tenure), that's he's a wonderful and caring husband.

The big one was when they found out that John remembers the anniversaries that his wife used to share.  There are four of them: her birthday, their wedding anniversary, his first daughter's birthday, and the day of her death.  I never minded this.  He was with her a long time, and his dedication is admirable.  And it's not like he always brings her up.  Sometimes she comes up in a story or two, but it's rarely about her.  I don't feel her as a competition, and the only things we have of hers are a few photos and some memorabilia in a box that he'll bring out on those special occasions.  She seemed like a wonderful woman, and I wish I could have met her.

The celebrations are short.  Usually a visit to church with a candle lighting, some prayers, and he visits a tree on the campus where he works and talks to it like it's his wife, since he has no grave to visit.  Then he usually gives a gift to the local homeless or food shelter in her or his late daughter's name.  I always help him, and he's always grateful.  He mentions me in the present tense when he talks to the tree, and he doesn't mind when I'm there, although sometimes he wants to be alone for half an hour or so, which I respect.  I suspect he cries a little.

Last year, we went to his home country and visited the area where she died.  It's now part of a shopping plaza built in the early 2000s.  Their economy has done well since the late 1990s.  It was a bit much for him emotionally, and he collapsed.  His daughter and I had to fly him back home early, and I confess, the event left me so drained I accidentally told my mother what happened.

Well, for a year now, they keep bringing it up.  ""You're just a surrogate,"" my older sister said.  ""That's so ghoulish,"" my father commented.  ""Is he retarded?  Like has the mind of a young boy?  Was his brain damaged by a shell casing or something?""  My mother is always trying to get me to distrust him.  ""I bet he wishes she was alive and you would be gone just like that,"" with a snap of her fingers.  They tell me that as a second marriage, I married ""used goods.""  That's particularly hurtful because I divorced my first husband, which they said was a mistake, and also he was our race.  But I left him because he was so cold and distant, and wanted lots of children, but I could never conceive.  ""Am I used goods?""  Well, I shouldn't have asked THAT!  My ex is still friends with my family, and I suspect he's ""biding his time"" to take me back, but no thank you!  I wish my ex would find another woman and have all the babies he wants with her, but I suspect unless someone does it for him, he'll still be at all the family gatherings.

I love my family, I really do, but they are so frustrating.  They are very traditional and so they view me as some kind of wayward lost little girl who should have stayed married, had lots of kids with a stoic husband, and definitely not have gotten a divorce and married a foreign teacher who talks to a tree 4 times a year (they don't know that part, can you IMAGINE?).  It's making family gatherings uncomfortable and I miss the fun we used to have. 

Am I so strange to love this man?  Am I a fool?

**tl;dr** My husband remembers his late former wife and daughter few times a year, and my family thinks I am stupid to be married to this man."
"My wife [30] THINKS she can sing, and it's driving me [29M] up the wall, and now she wants to sing at her sister's wedding


Been married six years. I love my wife dearly.


She thinks she can sing. She's always thought that she is a good singer, but honestly she is a terrible singer. I'm not saying I'm this great judge of singing talent because I'm not. But I know what sounds good, and my wife doesn't.


An example might be that we're in the car, and she'll hear a song she likes on the radio, and she'll just start singing aloud, really loudly to the song.


She'll sing loudly at home too while she's going about tasks.


I'm not a jerk and I know the difference of someone singing for joy and just being happy, and me, as witness to it, should just live and let live. I know the difference between that and someone who just sings so loudly and badly off key that it is actually painful and obnoxious to listen to.


In the car especially, her singing is so painful that it impairs my concentration. I want to tell her to not do it anymore but I don't want to sound mean and I know her ego is really telling her that she has a great voice.


My wife's sister [28] is getting married at the end of the year, and in talking about entertainment at her wedding, my wife volunteered to sing songs. My wife's sister and I suddenly looked at each other as if we'd secretly been discussing this the whole time, but we never said it before, not even once.


But it's like we both knew the other one knew that my wife cannot sing. My sister in law took me aside and said, ""Jack you know she can't sing and I'm not going to let her do this.""


But how do we let her down easy and tell her we don't want to sing? I don't want to tell her it's because her voice sucks and she's tone-deaf, because that would just kill her.


She's insisting that she wants to do this ""favor"" free of charge for her sister.


I also want to find a way to get her to stop singing without hurting her feelings.


In other ways she's really talented. She's a great cook, she draws well, she does her own makeup and other women's makeup, she is good at reading aloud (she volunteers reading at the library to kids).


Any ideas?

"[UPDATE] I [33 M] found a picture of my girlfriend's [30F] wedding day. She never mentioned being married.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4vto3v/i_33m_found_a_picture_of_my_girlfriends_30f/


I would like to thank everyone for their input.


We talked last night, I told her that I found pictures and she was confused and asked where, then she nonchalantly said 'oh, I forgot about that pics.'


Long story short, when she was in early 20s, she moved to France. She met a guy there, they fell in love. He was a rich Jew, she described herself as eastern European *gender slur word*, like his parents called her. They got married few months after they met. She just turned 23. His parents were super pissed and put a lot of pressure on him. Eventually reality hit them. They were both young and stubborn and they split after 2 years of marriage.



I asked her if she was embarrassed about failed marriage so that's why she didn't tell me. She said no. She said that she loved him, that they were happy. She said that with huge smile like when you are reminiscing about good, old memories which make your heart warm. I asked why she never mentioned him. She said that she didn't know what to tell. She never got closure. Eventually she started to believe that his family was right, she was unimportant to him and that their love never mattered. That it was all just a random fling, just signed papers that meant nothing. She left it behind her, didn't want to waste even more time justifying her decision or talking about him when she never knew what she was to him.



She gave me his contact information if I want to check with him. I did that, I admit I was curious. I said that I am dating Petra and that I just found out she was married... He saw my message in the evening, but he replied around 2 am. He shortly said yes, they were married for two years and they are legally divorced. An hour later he said (I translated this) 'It was a small wedding of two fools on a sunny day in December. That day crosses my mind often and never fails to make me smile. We were young and in love, I wish that I was stronger. She is amazing woman.'


So... That's it.


**Edit**


Few more things: Today she went on vacation (she offered to cancel it) so I will have some time to think about everything.

By mentioning that he was Jewish, I didn't mean to imply anything. I just quoted her words and thought that it was important to mention their different cultural background.

"My wife [42] and I [39M] own a successful restaurant, and our relatives are always trying to shame us into hiring them/their kids to work for us


Wife and I have been married ten years. Four years ago we decided to open a restaurant. My wife worked at a daycare center and I was the manager of a bar and grill. We both gave up our careers to try something new.


We opened a small but upscale Italian restaurant. My wife and I are both of Italian heritage (I speak Italian but she doesn't). We borrowed about four hundred thousand dollars at the bank. We never asked help or advice from our families, and we didn't want any, either. Members on both sides of our families took it upon themselves to tell us how stupid we were to try our hand at business, though. Scoff, scoff, scoff--that's what many of them did.


Besides our kitchen staff of four people (one chef, one sous-chef, and two assistants, there are nine employees who are all part time and rotate: we usually have two servers during lunch and four at dinner. Plus we have one custodian.


All of our employees are experienced professionals. Our most experienced server is fifty years old, full-blood Sicilian, and has been a professional server for thirty six years.


Needless to say, our restaurant lost money for a while as could be expected. Over the last two years though we started to pull slight profits and are slowly climbing out of the red.


My wife and I will still be paying back the bank for at least six or seven years, and that's if this year's positive outcomes continue. We get great reviews on Yelp and other sites, and we're very popular in the community.


---and now, here come the relatives. It's always some cousin or other relation talking about how their teenager needs experience, won't you let him work for you, or, I need extra income, can I be a server, do you make big tips?


It makes me sick. 


I already have all the staff I need at the moment, and I tell them this, but they act like I'm being selfish if I don't want to hire them or their relation, or that I'm choosing not to hire them because I only want to hire members from the other side of the family. Both sides of the family make the same claim, and the fact is my wife and I are the only ""related"" people in the whole business.


They seem to have this idea in their head that since our restaurant is popular, we're raking it in, and that our servers are making sixty grand a year with tips. Nonsense.


Worse is that none of our relatives have any experience serving, yet uncle so and so or aunt what's her face thinks their kid deserves to work at our restaurant because I'm their uncle or whatever.


Family members are already starting to gossip about how we're greedy and unwilling to share our success. I keep trying to explain that we're not yet ""successful"" if we still owe more than three hundred fifty thousand dollars to Chase Manhattan Bank, but they just don't seem to get it, and they keep yapping their mouths, too.


There have been a couple of recent, weird negative reviews online for our restaurant, which came coincidentally after I rejected a nephew's request to be a waiter.


Is there anything I can do about these people? Any way to make them get off my back and understand that just because I own a restaurant, doesn't mean I need to give all their kids a job?


---

tl;dr

Opened a restaurant with wife. Restaurant appears to be popular and thriving. Cue all the leech relatives looking for a job and expecting an easy hire because I'm their uncle/cousin. Don't want to give them jobs. Now they're leaving bad reviews for us online, and gossiping about us calling us cheap."

"(UPDATE) Me [22 F] lesbian feeling resentful towards my straight friends, but I don't want to be!


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nf3kz/me_22_f_lesbian_feeling_resentful_towards_my/

First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to my first post.  Your words of encouragement and hearing your experiences was so helpful to me and made me feel understood and much less alone.  I thought I would share this update with you guys.

On to the update.  I decided to take the advice of a lot of you and go to a gay event.   I went to an dance club event for lesbians and saw a beautiful girl dancing by herself at the wall.  Somehow I built up the courage to talk to her (don't even remember what I said to start the conversation) and we ended up dancing for a bit and then talking for about an hour outside.  It was an amazing conversation and we both basically shared our life stories.  She was smart, funny, cool, etc.  Basically all the good qualities you could ask for.

I got her number and asked her out the next day.  She said yes (!!!!) and we went mini golfing in the city and then by some miracle she agreed to come back to the place I was housesitting. We were just chilling under the stars on the patio drinking wine and then we started making out which led to me finally having sex.  It was an awesome experience but I was shocked by how physically exhausting it was.  Then we cuddled all night and went out for breakfast the next day.

Now we talk every day and go out as often as we can.  I've never liked someone that liked me back before, and it is honestly mindblowing.  I haven't been this happy in years.  Only liking straight girls for my entire life was rough, but suddenly, being gay doesn't feel so bad.  I'm being cautious with my feelings in case things don't work out, but just knowing that it's possible to have these experiences is enough for me right now.  

I really owe you guys for all your help.  Thank you!!!!!!

**tl;dr**: Ended up taking your advice and went to gay event, met amazing girl and now we are basically dating!!!!

"My vicious, high school bully [now 30M] just got hired at the same company I [29M] work for. I'm his new supervisor and I'm struggling with old, past feelings of hurt, and anger


I'm twenty-nine, married to a lovely woman [30] and have a baby at home [1F]. I work in accounting and have achieved quite a lot since graduating college six years ago: I manage a small department of eight other accountants, and earn close to a six figure salary. I'm fit, strong, and athletic. I work out regularly (running, hitting the speedbag, weights).


In high school, I was a skinny nerd. From 9th grade through 10th, I didn't have any girlfriends; in fact I didn't get laid until I was in college. I had friends, but they were all nerds, too.


In 8th grade, I had a friend, ""Josh."" Josh and I used to be best friends in middle school. We were into the same things, like Nintendo 64 and Playstation 2, graphic novels, and tinkering with computers.


In 9th grade, Josh completely changed. He suddenly wanted to be the ""cool"" kid and always kissed up to the popular kids in school to try to join their groups. He succeeded for the most part. I didn't want to follow his example because I thought he was being fake.


In the middle of 9th grade, Josh hit his growth spurt and grew over six feet tall. I was impressed but otherwise uninterested. Because he was only in 9th grade but already really tall and well-built, girls started noticing him, even ones in grades above ours, and he definitely became a popular kid.


I thought that was cool, good for him, but then he started picking on me in the quad for some reason. Like, he couldn't just leave me alone and be popular and live his life. It's like he actually sought me out to humiliate me.


In the school quad at lunch, him and his popular friends would come up to me, and I'd usually be sitting with one or two other nerdy kids, and he'd say, ""Look at this little [homophobic slur]. He used to always have a little crush on me in middle school.""


And of course his friends would eat it up. I didn't mind if a bunch of dumb guy bullies made fun of me, but it especially stung because girls would laugh at me too due to his treatment. I wrote for the school web newspaper, and my picture was on the website. Josh and his friends right-click-saved it and taped it to my locker, with a fake thought-bubble containing various homophobic material.


I could deal with all that, the humiliation, the needless mockery, but by tenth grade Josh actually began to bully me physically. He'd shove me into the wall if he were walking nearby. He was very popular by this time, always had a pretty girlfriend, always with a crew of other popular guys. I was always in more advanced classes than him so I avoided him academically, but in 9th and 10th grade I had to take Physical Education (state law), and just my luck. Josh was taking PE during the same period. 


He wasn't in my class (three PE teachers shared the same field) but when the teachers let us do ""free activity"" which they did every day for thirty minutes, Josh and his friends would shove me around again. One time in PE I actually tried to stand up to Josh and called him out for being a fake and a coward, always traveling with his crew.


Josh didn't like this, so he challenged me to fight him one on one right then and there. I was only fourteen and scared, much smaller than him. Someone behind me shoved me forward and I crashed into Josh. He shoved me back and punched me in the face. I didn't cry or anything that embarrassing, but I went down with a bleeding lip.


The teacher broke it up and Josh got suspended for two days. When he came back he'd always threaten to ""kill"" me. I asked my parents if I could switch schools. I always got really good grades so my parents trusted me when I said I wasn't feeling challenged by my teachers.


I eventually changed to a different and as it turned out better high school. I was still a nerd, but there were lots of nerds and I didn't get bullied anymore. Still didn't have girlfriends, but I was having a much better high school experience.


Except Josh and his friends found out different gaming messageboards I posted to, and joined up just to troll and make fun of me. This lasted for quite a while, with Josh always calling me the P-word, various homophobic slurs, and always saying he would beat me up if he ever saw me on the street.


Eventually he got tired of it and left me alone. By eleventh grade the bullying stopped, except for one brief period in 2005 when he found me on Myspace through mutual acquaintances and verbally abused me on social media for a while. The way I'm writing it makes it seem unemotional but at the time it was absolutely awful. But eventually that too, stopped, and I didn't see Josh again.


--Until yesterday, when our company hired a new junior accountant. And who did it happen to be? Josh. And where was he assigned? Why, to my department of course.


When I met him he didn't recognize me right away. I had grown a lot since 10th grade. In 12th grade I finally hit my growth spurt and became tall, even taller than Josh. And I worked out a lot in college. I was always a nerd, even in college, but I was an athletic nerd and ran the sprints for the track team, and played lacrosse. I didn't have any trouble with women in college, and always had a girlfriend. I met my wife, who was a year ahead of me, in my junior year. We married after six months together and have been happy ever since.


Josh looks for the most part the same but older and is balding slightly. He has a gut and is nowhere near as athletic as me. I knew him the second I saw him. My boss introduced me to him, and let me say my own full name to Josh. When I did so, Josh looked like he saw a ghost.


He didn't say anything to indicate that he knew me. I only told him I would be his supervisor, and ""your desk will be right there."" I gave him a guidebook and told him to come to me with any questions. I told him there would be a department meeting Wednesday (tomorrow) afternoon. I didn't do the whole ""so tell me a little about yourself"" bit that I do with all of the other new hires I supervise.


Josh hasn't made real eye-contact with me once since yesterday. Sometimes I'll be looking at him, remembering how much he hurt me when we were kids. He'll look up, meet my eyes, then quickly look back at his own computer.


Seeing him makes me feel flush with the pain I used to feel fifteen years ago, and all the bullying and pain and hurt come flooding back. My head is hot and my heart is racing just typing this. I'm really supposed to be typing a numbers report (I already finished) but instead I'm pretending to work while I am on Reddit. I'm looking at him right now, and he's deliberately refusing to make eye contact with me because he knows I'm looking.


I have ZERO doubt that I could beat the living sh-- out of this clown if he tried to bully me today. I could literally end his life if he tried to punk me again, and even if I took it easy on him I would turn him into a quadriplegic. 


I am fighting so hard not to walk on over to him right this second and backhand slap him across his stupid face and dare him to do something about it.


I just don't know what to do. I know that sooner or later (and probably tomorrow) I'm going to have to sit down in close proximity to this person, and I'm going to have to let him know that I know who he is. And he'll know what that means. He knows I remember all the crap he pulled, how badly he hurt me when we were kids.


I just don't know what to do from there, though. I have to work with this guy. I don't want to be his friend, but I don't know if I should work to be his enemy, either.


Advice appreciated, thanks.

"My best friend [25F] has been ignoring me for a year and now wants me [25F] to give her fiance a job.


I met my best friend ""Sarah"" on our first day of college and we lived together for the following three years. After college I moved to LA to work in film and she moved home with her parents to save up for grad school. I haven't seen her in person since graduation, but for the first year after college we texted every day, spoke on the phone often, and Skyped almost weekly. This continued until she randomly cut off contact with me out of the blue. I eventually got so worried about her that I called her mom, who awkwardly apologized and told me that Sarah's been spending time with her new boyfriend.  


After four months of not hearing a word from her, she finally texted briefly to tell me about ""Joe."" From the little she's told me and what I've gathered from his Facebook, Joe is an abrasive, homophobic misogynist. Sarah's very forward-thinking, but has a history of picking disrespectful boyfriends. This latest one seems to be sticking: I saw on FB a few weeks ago that they're engaged. Obviously I was really hurt that I had to find out through social media. But it gets worse-- 


I've been fortunate career-wise and a few months ago I got hired to write a big budget movie for a major studio. An interview I did got shared by one of our mutual friends, which I assume is how Sarah saw it. Yesterday I got a message from her asking if I could get Joe a job. Apparently he wants to be a TV writer. Nowhere in her message did she congratulate me or ask how I'm doing. 


Obviously I have no intention of trying to get Joe a job, but I can't help it-- I really want my friend back. When she's not in a relationship, Sarah is the greatest, most supportive friend ever. It's like she transforms into somebody I don't know as soon as she gets a boyfriend. Is there any hope for our friendship, or is it time to say goodbye for good?

"My [24F] boyfriend [29M] of 3 years is inexplicably angry and jealous of me singing to women


This is absolutely doing my head in so I hope you can help. I've never posted here before but heard a friend talk about it a few times.





My boyfriend James is a normal, sane human being (well I thought so anyway) with a stable job in the medical industry and has, before now, shown no signs of being, well, nuts. He's also shown no signs of being homophobic in any way.


SO. I am a fairly decent singer and recently (6 months) ago started booking gigs on the weekends at events, weddings, bars/clubs and such. They pay me and I sing covers of songs, do requests, stuff like that. Great, I love singing, I can make money on doing it - fantastic. 


Ever since the first gig James came to, we've had problems. He sat through most of my performance, was great when I had breaks and generally seemed happy. A few friends were there too and everyone said I did great. Until I got to a song near the end. The song isn't that important but for the record it was ""Let Her Go"" by Passenger (you may know it) the song is clearly written about a woman, the lyrics have references i.e. ""*You see her when you close your eyes*"" ""*Only know you love her when you let her go*"" ETC. It's a pretty popular song, anyway. So during this song my boyfriend gets up and goes to the bar. I kind of notice it out of the corner of my eye but don't take much notice. And he's quiet for the rest of the night until we get home. 


When we get home he is angry/pouting and I can tell but don't really know why. So we get into bed and he tells me that he doesn't want me singing ""those kind of songs"" anymore because it's ""disrespectful to our relationship"" and ""sends the wrong message"". I was like WTF. Firstly I asked him to clarify the song, then when he told me which one I genuinely thought he was kidding. Because he surely couldn't be objecting to me singing ""her"" or ""she"", right!? No, wrong. He was angry that I was singing to a woman. 


So by this point I am now fuming because who is he to tell me what to sing and also this is insane in my mind so I pretty much said alright buddy you're being ridiculous, and went to sleep hoping that was the end of it. 


It wasn't.



In the past 6 months he has come to 6-8 gigs of mine and every time I sing a song with reference to a woman in, he storms out. It is causing huge problems between us and I do not understand it. We will argue afterwards about he. He insists is isn't homophobia, but he won't give me another reason other than that it isn't respectful to the relationship. I refuse to stop singing popular songs that I enjoy singing because they have ""she/her"" in them, or pulling a musical no-homo and changing it to ""he/him"" (as he suggested - he's FINE with me singing about men but not women - because it could be about him I suppose). I think it's absolutely ridiculous! 


So this all came to a head on Saturday night when I had a gig and an Ed Sheeran song was requested. There were a lot of references to ""her/she"". WELL I'm sure you can guess how well that went down. Now we aren't speaking and I don't know what to do.


I love this man. He has never shown ANY signs of jealousy or controlling behaviour, including if a man has made a comment or something at a bar. He has no problems with men coming up and saying hi after my sets etc. Am I overreacting or being stubborn? Should I just back down on this one for the sake of the relationship?


I have tried to think of any sane reason he might hate it but I can't think of one. Reddit, please help!!


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend thinks me singing songs with ""she/her"" should be replaced with ""he/him"" because it is disrespectful to our relationship

"My [24F] boyfriend [25M] is furious because I decided to get rid of my bed and sleep in the closet.


I just moved into a new apartment which is much tinier than my old one, but in a nicer area. It's a studio with a huge walk in closet. On my first night here I didn't have any furniture yet, so I threw my TempurPedic mattress topper on the floor of the closet and slept in there. It was actually super cozy and comfortable, so I decided to stick with it. I've now furnished the rest of the apartment like a normal living room, and I sleep in the closet every night. Now, I realize that this is kind of quirky and bizarre, but I don't usually have people over, and I like saving the floor space. 


My boyfriend of 5 months came over for the first time this morning and was shocked to see my sleeping arrangements. At first I laughed at his reaction, but then I realized that he was actually, genuinely upset. I would understand if it was a sex thing and he didn't feel like banging on the floor, but we rarely spend time at my place because both of our jobs are much closer to his house (and also, he has an actual house as opposed to a studio apartment). He texted me after leaving and said he was really upset by the lack of a bed, and he would take me to the store this weekend and buy me one. 


I'm extremely pissed off by this, and I want to know if it's justified. His reaction and text made me feel like a) he has no sense of humor about life, and b) he feels ""responsible"" for me in a creepy patriarchal way. 



I know it seems like a dumb thing to break up over, but this is my first actual relationship, and I don't like that I already feel disrespected. Am I being an idiot? Is he? 



**EDIT: Should have made this much much clearer. He was not expressing shocked concern or even mild irritation. His exact words were, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? Only a lunatic would live like this."" He had raised his voice at this point and I told him to stop yelling, as we were in an apartment building. He stormed out and went home even though we had plans later that night. His text came about an hour later.**

"Ten years ago I [43M] caused the death of my daughter. I feel like I need closure with my ex-wife [43F]. Is it selfish?


I've been debating posting here for three weeks. I don't know how to begin putting this into words so I'll just start. Ten years ago my wife and I were happily married with a beautiful healthy baby girl. Through a mix of bad luck and unforgivable stupidity, I caused her tragic death when she was just 11 months old. At the time I dealt with it in the worst possible way. I became a terrible person, cut ties with every single person in my life, and threw myself furiously into my career. I left my wife and never looked back. Over this last decade I had frequent panic attacks, but those were the only times I let myself think about my old life and what I had done. Otherwise I was completely in denial. 


Something happened to me recently that made me wake up. When everything hit me I couldn't deal and tried to kill myself, but I fucked it up and I'm still here. (Not planning to try again at the moment but I know a lot of people will think I should.) Now that I'm ""back to my senses"" I'm trying to cope with my guilt, but i know my life is ruined forever. 



My wife will never and should never forgive me. But I feel that I owe it to her to at least let her know how much I'm suffering now. Maybe it would help her. 


What do you think?

**tl;dr**: I caused the death of our only child ten years ago. Should I try to contact my ex-wife to tell her how sorry I am?"
"My sisters (19/18F) and parents (57M/54F) are bothering me about why I (29F) don't wish to provide my sisters with extra money for fun, I'm already paying their full University fees.


So there's 4 of us girls, the 3 mentioned in the title and 1 other sister, 26 years of age.


I came into a considerable amount of money about 4 years ago, well, it's more like I got very lucky with some financial decisions and it paid very well. I was able to pay off my parents mortgage for them, purchase a nice home for myself and at 25, I had enough money to live comfortably after paying off my own school loans as well as that of my other sister. 


When my 2 youngest sisters started University last year, I decided I'd pay for them to go to college, rather than have them take out loans and have to pay back a lot of money, spend years paying it off and all of that, so that's that. Their University fees for 3 years are taken care of. 


Now the problem is that my mom recently asked if I could provide them with extra money, when I asked why  she seemed to hesitate before telling me it's for them to be able to spend on going out, spending time with friends etc


My 2 youngest sisters adore partying, they were quite popular in high school and in our country they've got a lot of their friends at the same University, they like going clubbing and drinking at bars every couple weeks. Nothing is wrong with that but I don't see why I should have to pay for them to do this, my other sister and I both worked part time in university so if we wanted to buy anything or go out with friends or whatever, we could do it with our own money, especially as we didn't come from a wealthy family by any means. 


I said no. Thought my mom dropped it. Then my dad brought it up. Then Mt 2 youngest sisters. Their argument is it wouldn't dent what I have in the slightest to provide them with spending money while they're studying, that it'd be easier if they had the money available rather than having to balance school and a job. I do not think that's fair in the slightest considering I'm shelling out over 75k each. It's not a problem to give them money, I just don't think I should have to when I'm already paying off their school fees in full. 


Not to mention they both want about 2000 to 3000 a month for the 3 years they're at school. For shopping, buying things for parties, going drinking etc. Again they've pointed out it wouldn't hurt my decent sized fortune to do this and it's true but I really think if they want to enjoy themselves, they should work for it especially since they don't need to worry about paying back loans or anything. 




**tl;dr** :  I'm paying my 2 sisters fill University fees, they both enjoy going out to parties and clubs, parents and the two of them want me to give them extra money to spend on these things "

"My [26F] boyfriend's [27M] younger brother [21M] trashed our new apartment, and the landlord got involved. My boyfriend doesn't think it's that big of a deal. What can I do here?


Trying to keep this short. Using a throwaway.

My boyfriend Kyle and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 1, and just recently moved into a new apartment together. Kyle has a younger college-aged brother, Brandon, who is a sweet guy but pretty immature. I love Kyle's family...Kyle and Brandon are close, too, so we see Brandon every so often. 

Brandon lives in another state, where he goes to school. He's on summer break right now, and asked if he could come and visit Kyle and I and see our new apartment. Kyle and I had existing plans to go to a birthday party out of town, which conflicted with the day Brandon would be arriving in town to see us. 

Kyle asked if it was okay if Brandon stayed at our place for one night, while we were out of town. I was hesitant but agreed, and asked Kyle to tell Brandon to be considerate of our apartment and neighbors - i.e. no loud parties, no smoking in the apartment, etc. Basically, agreeing to the rules Kyle and I agreed to with our landlord when we signed the lease. 

Kyle left the keys for Brandon and texted him some ground rules — don't throw a party, here's the wifi password, don't smoke in the house. We have a pullout couch that turns into a bed, so we set it up for him before we left. Brandon thanked us both and said he was tired anyway and would probably just go to bed. 

The next morning, after the birthday party, Kyle texts Brandon and says we'll be home in about an hour and a half. No response. As we're on our way home, our landlord calls me and says he received noise complaints from the neighbors last night and that the neighbors had called the police. I sat there, stunned, and told him that we were out of town but a family member had been staying at the apartment. The landlord is livid at this point, saying that it's not okay for us to have guests over if they're going to disrespect the apartment and the other tenants. I tell him that I agree completely, and keep apologizing. At this point Kyle is whispering to me, ""What happened? What's going on?"" Once I get off the phone with the landlord, I'm in tears and I tell Kyle what happened. Kyle sits there quietly and says that we shouldn't jump to conclusions until we get back to the apartment. 

When we get home, I practically run up the stairs and burst into the apartment. Brandon is in *our* bed with a girl, and the house wreaks of cigarettes. Brandon immediately jumps out of bed and says, ""I didn't know you guys would be home so soon!! I was going to clean up!!"" I just stare at him in disbelief and walk to the living room.

The living room is covered in red solo cups, a broken glass, and smells like old beer. Our new kitchen table is set up like a beer pong table. There's someone's computer and speaker hooked up in the living room...and in the office, there's a guy passed out on the floor. 

I immediately burst into tears and Kyle starts screaming at Brandon, telling him to get the fuck out. Brandon screams back at Kyle and tells him to ""chill"" and I also start to scream at Brandon. The additional guy and girl that we don't know immediately wake up and run out of the apartment before we can say anything to them. 

Kyle and I spent the entire day cleaning quietly. I told Kyle that Brandon can never, ever stay at our apartment again. At this point, Kyle says that I'm overreacting and that while Brandon was an asshole, he doesn't think it's ""that big of a deal"". I'm in disbelief and Kyle and I get into an argument. 

In the meantime, we haven't heard a word from Brandon. Not even an apology. Kyle's parents called us and asked what had happened, because apparently Brandon called them and said he needed money to stay in a hotel room for the rest of his trip. 

I'm furious, confused, and Kyle and I still can't agree on this subject. I feel like I hate Brandon and am considering ending things with Kyle over this. 

What can I do in this situation? How do I move forward, and make sure Brandon pays for the damage he's done? 

TL;DR - Boyfriend's younger brother threw a party in our new apartment, while we weren't there. Boyfriend doesn't think it's that big of a deal. "

I will be short, thanks for any input.




We have been together for 3 years now. Live together 1 year. I met Petra when she moved in Berlin. She is lovely and gorgeous.




I needed to ship something and I was searching for boxes in her closet. She has more than enough and she said that I can take it. I took 5-6 boxes from top shelf just to check which one suits the best. All the boxes had shoes in it, but only one was empty and had 2 pictures in it. 



One was a picture of her in a wedding dress with a guy in a suit from maybe 5-6 years ago. They were laughing. 
Second one was probably taken few seconds after and it was a picture of him kissing her cheek and she was showing a ring to a camera. On the back of the second photo was sentence in French, google translates it as 'you make me feel great Petra'.




She isn't home yet and I have no idea what to do. Is it okay to ask about it, or?




Tl;dr: my girlfriend was married, she never mentioned it. Is it my business to ask something about it?"

"My [27m] girlfriend's [26f] best friend [27f] can't carry a child, and asked my girlfriend to have her baby. My girlfriend is strongly considering it. Do I have a say here?


There are quite a few people in this story, so I'll break it down:

Me - 27m
Girlfriend - Nicole, 26f
Girlfriend's Best friend - Sarah, 27f
Best friend's husband - Mike, 28m

Where do I start. Nicole and I have been together for a little over three years, and live together. I have never loved any woman the way that I love Nicole. We've had serious discussions on marriage and kids, and I am planning to propose in the next year, maybe sooner. I already have a ring, which Sarah actually helped me pick out for Nicole. 

One of the things I have always loved about Nicole is her kindness and generosity. She's great with kids and I *know* she'll be a great mom..and I want kids, too! We both agreed that we don't want kids now, but can see them in the future. I'm at a great point in my career, and so is Nicole. We want to travel, save money, and do what mid-late 20 somethings like to do. 

Nicole and Sarah have been best friends since they were born. Their mom's are best friends, and they are best friends. Sarah is by far Nicole's closest friend, most of the time I think of them as sisters. Sarah and her husband Mike live in the same city as us, and we see them frequently. They are a great couple..in fact, it really doesn't feel like we're hanging out with another ""couple"" with them. Mike and I hang out semi-frequently and I would say we're good friends. 

Sarah, like Nicole, has always wanted kids. When she and Mike got married last year, Nicole and I made a bet on how soon it would be until Sarah was pregnant. Much to our surprise, Sarah and Mike admitted that they wanted to be married for at least a year before trying to have a kid. 

Which brings us to present day. According to Sarah, she and Mike have been trying to get pregnant for 6 months. Sarah eventually went to a doctor, who told her that it was something with her uterus (I can't remember what it's called...but she can't carry children). The doctor, however, told her that her eggs are healthy and that she should strongly consider surrogacy if they want to have children. Sarah told Nicole all about this during the process. There were a lot of tears from the both of them, and Nicole talked to me about it a lot as well. Sarah told Nicole that she was going to start looking for surrogates as soon as possible. This was about 3 weeks ago. 

Earlier this week, Sarah was over at our place. I was in the bedroom watching a movie, but I could hear that Nicole and Sarah were having a serious conversation. After Sarah left, Nicole came into the bedroom and told me that she had something important that we needed to talk about. 

Sarah asked Nicole if she would be the surrogate for her baby. After researching, Sarah realized that surrogates are extremely expensive and can take a long time to find. And apparently, Sarah has a doctor that *strongly suggests* the surrogate has had a child before...but it isn't a complete requirement. This is all according to Nicole on behalf of Sarah.

Nicole and I talked about it for a long time. Nicole said she wasn't sure how she was feeling, but that she would strongly consider doing this for Sarah. She mentioned that she and Sarah feel like sisters, she's her best friend in the world, Sarah would do the same thing for her (if she could). Nicole also mentioned that she would love to experience pregnancy before we decide to have kids of our own, and said she is excited at the thought of being pregnant. 

Nicole asked me about how I'm feeling about this, and truthfully I feel weird. While I don't feel like I have a say in their business entirely, this would make a huge impact on mine and Nicole's lives for 9+ months. This could throw a wrench into our engagement/marriage plans, travel plans, etc. My girlfriend would be pregnant with her best friend's baby. I'm not even sure how surrogacy works afterward, but would she have to breastfeed it? I really have no idea. 

Plus, for completely selfish reasons, I would be living with a pregnant woman for 9 months. I know what pregnancy hormones can do to women. I know what pregnancy does to women's bodies (sort of). While this wouldn't influence me the way it will influence Nicole, it will still be hugely impactful for us. I can't imagine having Nicole do this before the two of us are ready to have a kid of our own yet, even if we won't be getting a kid out of this deal. 

So, I guess what I'm looking for here is 1) If Nicole decides to do this, what do I say? What can I do? 2) Do my opinions matter in this situation, or am I just the asshole bf here? 3) How do I talk to her about this without upsetting her, or making her feel like I don't support her?

TL;DR - Girlfriend's best friend said ""Have my baby"". I feel weird. What do I do?

"My mother [73] is planning to buy an extremely elaborate 75th birthday gift for my father, and is asking each of my siblings [39M, 32F] and I [37] to contribute to the cost, but expects me to pay the most because I earn the most money


My father is turning 75 in September. Prior to his retirement ten years ago, he was a university professor (philosophy).


My mother considers his seventy-fifth birthday a big milestone, and wants to get him a heavily-customized, Rolex ""Submariner"" watch, which is already very expensive in its basic form, but, after her customizations (different materials, engraving, etc.), the retailer quoted her a cost of twelve thousand dollars.


My parents have three children: my older brother, who is lieutenant-colonel in the army (he went to West Point), my sister, who went to college for an English degree but married a lawyer and is currently a stay at home mother, and me. I went to medical school and am an anesthesiologist.


In the past, I'd always given my parents and siblings sensible, practical gifts for their birthdays. Even though, admittedly I earn more money than either of my siblings, I do not spend a lot of money on their presents. In relative terms, I will usually spend a few hundred dollars to buy a close family member a present.



My mother phoned each of us to talk about her gift-giving plans. My parents live in Berkeley, California, my sister is in Boston, my brother is currently serving in Maryland, and I live in Chelsea, Manhattan.


She had gotten my brother and sister to each pledge two thousand dollars toward the purchase of the watch. My mother intends to pay another two thousand dollars out of her personal spending money (she never worked a job for pay but my father always shared his salary and now retirement fairly with her). So, she and my two siblings are each contributing an equal share.


That leaves a balance due of six thousand dollars, not including tax which I'm guessing will be another thousand dollars or so.


My mother point blank said that I should pay for the outstanding six thousand dollars.


I told her I didn't like the idea that I'm paying more than my siblings (and her) for a present that I had no input in selecting and which I would have never chosen.


My mom says that I am being selfish and that since I make far more money than my brother and sister, it's morally right that I pay more for my father's gift.


Personally I think my father will not like having such a ridiculously expensive watch. His taste is just different. He is more of a Dockers, cardigan, and Keds kind of person. 


But more importantly I don't like that my mother is choosing a present and attaching my name to it without asking my opinion on anything. I think the watch as she has it configured is loud, obnoxious, and tacky.


Furthermore, she acts as if it is my duty to contribute more because I'm in a financial position to do so. I can understand if it's a life or death situation where someone needs money to have a new and experimental treatment done, but this is a present.


I'm not as sure about my sister because she's always been a bit of a princess, but I'm certain my brother would never go along with my mother's idea if he knew that I was contributing more than the others. 


I told my mother I'd get back to her and then made an excuse and hung up. She's been texting me a lot telling me to send the money soon. I texted her that I think it's unfair to ask me to contribute three times as much as anyone else's contribution, and double everyone else's contribution combined.


She tells me I'm being selfish and petty and ungrateful.


I'm certainly grateful for them giving me food and shelter as a kid but my college and medical school were paid 100% by scholarship and loan, which I paid back on my own.
   

I suggested that she get a less extravagant gift more in line with my father's taste, but she insists that it's his 75th, it's special, and that I'm being a miser.


I'll probably end up just giving the money. Six thousand dollars is a lot, but it won't hurt me that much, really.


I just feel sore about it, is all.


I'm not looking for answers or counsel, just getting down on the screen and releasing some energy.

"Me [19F] with my Aunt [40sF] wants to have my dog put down for nipping at my cousin [5F]


I'm going to make this fast because I have class soon. 

Backstory: My Aunt has two children, H [9M] and K [5F]. This incident happened with K. My Aunt is known for being an overbearing and very overprotective mother. The stereotypical ""helicopter"" parent. She doesn't let her kids leave her side for one second. My little cousin H is actually in therapy because he already has anxiety regarding the world and thinks he's going to die because of what my Aunt says to him. My uncle is a good parent, but he is sort of just hates dealing with his wife regarding parenting.

My dog is a 2-year-old long haired retriever. He doesn't have a history of violence whatsoever and is honestly the sweetest boy ever. He loves cuddling and being pet and is a quiet/great dog all around. For anyone who has a retriever, you know exactly what I'm talking about. 

The incident: On Sunday, my family was hosting a picnic-type get together at our house for our extended family. My aforementioned Aunt and Uncle and their 2 kids (H and K) were there, and ended up staying the longest. H really loves coming to our house because he's able to do a lot of things at our house that he isn't able to do at home, like swim, so they tend to stay a while so the kids can play. 

Well, as everyone was packing up and getting ready to go, my little cousin K went over to the couch to hug my mom. My dog was laying on the floor right in front of the spot where my mom was sitting, sleeping. So to get on the couch, K uses my dog as a step-stool and steps on his back. Taken by surprise, my dog yips and then twists his back around and nips at her.

Of course it scared K so she starts crying, and then my Aunt runs over and starts demanding we search her for any bite marks. My mom and Aunt begin searching through her hair, and on her scalp they find a single tooth indent. No blood was drawn, no skin was broken, just an indent of where one of his teeth got her. So my Aunt starts yelling, ""He got her! Look (husband) he got her!"" Then she gets on the phone with the ER to make sure K is okay. Meanwhile my dog has already run into his kennel in the other room because he knows he messed up and is waiting to be punished.

Next she asks for all of dogs information, like his age, history, rabies shots, etc. and says she will ""see what she can do about this."" 

I'm just wondering if she is right in this situation, and does she have a case against my dog? He was surprised, and he showed restraint by not biting clear into K. But I know that a dog is a dog and a human is a human, and people take this stuff very seriously. Parents, would you have reacted the same? My parents have a good relationship with them, but say they're not allowed back into our house again if they do anything to harm our dog. Thanks.

**tl;dr**: Dog nipped at my cousin after being stepped on and my over-protective Aunt wants to have him reprimanded. 

EDIT: Wow everyone, thanks for all of the responses. I'm glad to see lots of animal lovers out there :) I'm just going to add one thing: when my Aunt said she'll ""see what she can do about this,"" she said it snidely, implying repercussions for my dog. She didn't outright say ""put down"" but I didn't know how else to word it. Legal action maybe? I don't know. I would change the title if I could but ya'know....

I just made the post to see what everyone thought could come of the situation and if we were in the wrong. Again, thanks for your input! "
"Family and friends calling me shallow because I (21F) broke up with my bf (27M) after my weight loss


As a couple we decided that we were going to get in shape together. We love being outside and exercise, we used to be health nuts and taking care of the food we ate. Even though we continued to exercise daily, our food plan wasn't great, so we decided to change it. So, we developed a ""health plan"". Because of it, I went from 155 lbs and 5'10 to 125 lbs (currently adding muscle and toning) but he stayed the same weight (6'3 and 180 lbs). I started to get fit, lots of guys started to pay attention to me and I've been asked several times to be a model. I won't try to say that this wasn't good: it was really good for me and my ego and my really low self esteem is now at a normal level. Life's good, I'm happy and I'm feeling good. Bf was happy with my new body, always grabbing me, but didn't like the new attention which is understandable in my opinion. 

He and I continued to exercise until I was 140 lbs, then he started to come up with excuses. Then, after I achieved my goal weight (135 lbs), my bf started to ask for pizza and other things. I said that it was ok for me if he ate it, but I didn't want. He went nuts, started telling me that I was obsessed with weight loss, that I'm an anorexic and hurtful things. Then, when I suggested running, hiking, some physical activity that we always did in the past, he would always say no and suggest other thing (watch a movie, sex, cooking) and would make me feel guilty of leaving to do some exercise (as I've said before, we've done it daily since we met until my '140 lbs' mark). I was starting to feel really unhappy as all the things I loved to (that we both loved to do on the past) were being neglected and I am just not a person to stay indoors and watching tv and relaxing. I hate it. I have lots of energy.

The final thing: I discovered why he didn't lose weight, when he was ""trying so hard, I don't get it"" (his words). He packed his healthy lunch at home and then would dump it (I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY, I HATE WHEN PEOPLE WASTE FOOD) and he would eat pizza/a sub/McDonald's. I saw a receipt, asked him about it and after some time in which he tried to say he didn't remember, proceeded to confess! I broke off with him right there, as I've had enough.

Now, he told everyone that I became a shallow bitch when I lost weight and I want to have a man with abs and be eye-candy. Everyone believes him, this is a small town, and I'm being seen as the fucking shallow bitch. At the same time, he's sending dozens of messages everyday (100+) asking me to consider it, that he loves me. What can I do? I love him a lot and I want to be with him, but now I just don't recognize him and our fun times of the past are completely lost. I fell in love with his full of energy, always moving persona, not this lazy person (a shadow of what he was). He promised me that he would change and asked me to go to the doctor, because I'm completely obsessed with it (with all these troubles, I lost the additional 10 pounds which makes his story even more credible).

Should I go back to him and trust that he is going to be back and go to a doctor as he asked? Am I completely delusional and out of line? I hate being badmouthed like it, I don't have thick skin and these comments really hurt me. Reddit, help.

**tl;dr**: I lost weight. Bf started to refuse to do the activities that we've always done (exercise, even when my weight was higher) and lied to me about eating healthy. Everyone thinks that I broke up with him because I lost weight, not because of this. He promises that he will change his ways if I go to a doctor. Do I sound obsessed and he is right? Or should I stay firm?"
"My [21F] brother [22M] died. His ex is telling everyone that he was a horrible person and world is a better place now that he's gone.


My brother died two weeks ago, a genetic heart problem. It was a long time coming so it wasn't a shock but it's not any less sad for us. The problem is that his ex girlfriend who is being a complete asshole right now. This is what she posted on Facebook:

""My ex died. I'm not glad he's dead but I'm glad he's gone. World is a better place without him in it.""

When I saw it it had already received a lot of negative replies from her friends telling her that she's being very rude and disrespectful. She deleted that and later sent:

""Look you misunderstood me. I didn't want him dead. I just don't want him walking among us. I guess behind bars was enough but I'm not going to pretend I'm sad he's dead because I'm not.""

It took me every ounce of my self restraint to not reply or go find her and punch her in the face but that's not the end of it. She's been posting things about him that make him look like a psychopath and I'm sure they're lies. She says he did drugs, he cheated on her, he watched dog fighting, and other things. These are all lies. They broke up because of his declining health and because she wanted sex and he couldn't do it anymore. That was 9 months ago. Not because of cheating! He wasn't even physically able to have sex with anyone at that time, let alone cheating on her.

My brother was very unlucky. He died so young and his memory is all that remains and it's so hurtful to see her doing this to his memory and I don't know what to do. My other brother and me are very upset.

What's the best way to approach and handle this problem?

"How do I [26M] get my girlfriend [30F] to stop humble-bragging so much?


""I can't stand how guys won't stop staring at me! Just because I'm in shape and bother to put myself together before leaving the house, doesn't mean it's an invitation to hit on me.""


""Oh my god, I would SO eat that candy bar, but I need to watch my figure. I mean, I'm 5'10"" and 125, but I can't afford to slip up.""


""Everyone always comes to me for advice. I just don't understand why. I mean, I do have an associates in psychology, but still... I guess it's because people look at me and can tell that I'm just a deep thinker, and can help them through whatever it is on their mind.""


""Most people can't make outfits like this work, but I'm sort of a maverick and rebel. It's part of my style.""


I sometimes feel bad hearing girls talk about their weight and skin problems, because I've never had to go through those. I'm just naturally thin and have a clear complexion. I just can't relate.""


Most people don't know how to dance. You just have to move with the music, feel it in your soul. That's why I'm so free on the dancefloor...""

^^^

So yeah, I love my girlfriend of two years, but she always says insufferable shit like that.


Lately it's been coming more often.


Have no idea why.


Our relationship is good otherwise. She contributes to our shared living expenses, she cooks, she is a good listener and is helpful with all sorts of things. She's good at designing and sewing original fashion. Our physical relationship is great.


But her bragging, or humble-bragging is really getting annoying. We'll be in a group of people and she'll whip out something like, ""I sometimes hate being in my office; I feel like I'm the only one there with a sense of style.""


People in the group will smile politely but I'm just getting red with embarrassment for her. It's not that I feel that she has no reason to be proud.


In truth, she CAN dance well, she IS tall, thin and beautiful, she DOES have style, pretty much all the things she humble-brags about are true, really.


It's just annoying to hear her toot her own horn.


Make no mistake; I am completely free and generous in praising her, and do so regularly.


Any strategies to help make a humble-braggart check herself a little bit?


I really get embarrassed for her, because the humble-bragging ends up looking so desperate and obvious.

She didn't used to be like this. I don't get it.


I'm just looking for ways to gently hint that she's bragging too much, without looking like I'm being mean.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend has been really kind of full of herself lately with the humble-bragging. Looking for advice on what I can say to her to make her aware of how it's annoying and desperate sounding."
"My (41/M) husband of 3 years has become a workaholic and is mad that I (37/f) will not work overtime.


My husband and I have been married for 3 years, together for 7 total. It is my first marriage, his second, and we do not have children by choice.

He works in the tech industry and I am an ER nurse. He makes much more money than I do but I have always been really good with finances so  I brought more assets into the relationship.

About 2 years ago now he was offered a job with a significant increase in pay. Unfortunately it was with a company that is pretty notorious for expecting its employees work crazy hours and pretty much devote their life to work. I was hesitant about him working there because of this but he was really excited about the opportunity. He took the job but we both agreed that if it took over his life and affected our marriage he would leave. Obviously that has not been the case...

He now makes considerably more money than I do and works insane hours. His typical work week is 70ish hours and when they have special projects he can end up working over 100 hours in a week. Meanwhile I work 3 12 hour shifts a week and pick up one mandatory day of overtime a month.

Due to a shortage of staff my work calls me constantly to pick up overtime. I always decline. I have been a nurse since I was 23 and have found that working more than my current schedule quickly leads to me feeling burned out and my work suffering. 

Before my husband sold his soul to his current employer he was fine with me not picking up extra shifts. Now he has become increasingly frustrated by me not working more hours. He will make little comments about how he is slaving away so I can lead the good life. If he comes home and I am doing something relaxing I have to listen to a martyrdom rant about how he never gets any rest and it must be nice, etc etc. I have nieces and nephews that live far from me and I like to fly out to visit them every other month or so. This never bothered him before but now he complains about my ""jet setting"" lifestyle that he is paying for.

Meanwhile, since he is never home I do 100% of all cooking, cleaning, shopping, yard work and pet care. I do not slack in this area so it is not like he is coming home to a messy house and me laying around. I consider myself a good housekeeper and keep our place clean. 

The strangest part is that we do not need any extra money. We have no credit card debt, both our cars are paid off, and we have income from rental properties that covers our mortgage. We could both quit our jobs tomorrow and be fine. His argument is that we can retire early and it is stupid to leave money on the table. I feel like it is ridiculous to make myself miserable for an uncertain future. Especially because we are not hurting financially. He says I feel like that because I have the luxury of his income.

It has gotten to the point where I am avoiding being home when he is there and awake. We only see eachother in passing now and even then I have to listen to him complain about his job and imply that I am lazy. I have suggested counseling and he scoffed at the idea and refused. I feel like my marriage has completely collapsed and I don't even know my husband anymore. I want to make a last ditch effort to talk to him about quitting his job or at lease working fewer hours. I am unsure of the best way to approach this and would appreciate any input on the best way to get my point across and make sure he understands how miserable I am with the state of our marriage

I've always been the black sheep. They're hyper-competitive, I'm not. They enjoy hunting, I don't. Work's their life and I've been on an extended vacation since '08. You get the idea.

So the short and tall of it is that I dropped out and entered the work force as soon as I possibly could. I saved every penny, moved out on my eighteenth and bought some land and what would nowadays be called a tiny house. 

Ever since then I've devoted most of my life to my interests, hobbies, and friends. I play music, travel, do charity work, whatever. They've always disapproved, partially due to religion and partially due to them being generally manipulative people.

For my birthday they gave me an ultimatum. Either I ""grow up"" or they'll never speak to me again. They've managed to corral a good chunk of my family against me as well. I'll admit that I don't particularly like the vast majority of them but it still hurts.

**TL;DR** Family's disowning me, I'm at a loss as to what to do. My life is _wonderful_, but I don't want to lose my family either. "
