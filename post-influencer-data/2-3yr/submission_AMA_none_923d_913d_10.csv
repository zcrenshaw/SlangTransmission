"AMA REQUEST - Bullies who were the cause of a suicide.


We always get the victims side. We always know what the friends or family thought. But never once, have I heard what the Bullies thoughts were. This isn't to bash you or anything like that. 

I just honestly want to know you're thoughts on the situation. What did you think when you found out they committed suicide due to the bulling? What was the first thing you did? Did you go to the funeral? I just want to hear your side."

"I survived being abused for 36 years by a mother with Munchausen by proxy (factitious disorder on another). AMA!


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your thoughtful questions and caring responses! I'm wiped and going to take a nap. I'll respond to any other questions in a few hours."
