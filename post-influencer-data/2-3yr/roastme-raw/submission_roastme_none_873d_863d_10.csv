"400,000 Burnt Hams!


400,000 Subscribers. That's a big ass number.

When I first joined this sub, we had around 90,000 subscribers, we've come a long way. To see over 400,000 people obliterating one another, it's truly a beautiful thing.

You've made people laugh, you've made people cry. You've made people create accounts and delete accounts. We've roasted redditors, we've roasted randomers, we've roasted celebrities. Next up we're going to roast a President! (I wish, we need a real celebrity instead of these """"""""celebrities"""""""". We actually beat The_Donald to 400k, perfect time for a roasting!)

From the bottom of our cold dead hearts here at the /r/RoastMe Mod Team, we want to say thank you to each and every one of you, except for you Dave you can fuck off.

Here's to another 400,000!"
