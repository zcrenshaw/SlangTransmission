"I have been to prison in NY and NJ several times. AMA about those state prisons and the differences between them.


I made an offhand comment in a /mildlyinteresting post about having been to prison. 6 people have asked me to do an AMA in response to that comment. I think this type of AMA is posted far too often, but these people obviously disagree. So here it is. Ask me anything. I will answer any question that does not risk revealing my IRL identity. "
"I was born into a cult and finally left at 25 years old! AMA!


I commented on the ex cult post from the other day and a few people asked me to do an AMA. I prefer this smaller sub since I still have family in the cult and don't want to get them in trouble. 

I don't know if a lot of people have heard of William Branham, but he was friends with Jim Jones of Jonestown massacre fame. I was born into a church in an island in the Caribbean where the pastor had his fingers in everyone's lives and they saw William Branham as a prophet sent in the end times to usher in the rapture. Think old school hard core Pentecostal but with access to people's finances as well. Well my parents got tired of that and moved to a state the Midwest United States where they had a sister church that was a bit more liberal (the pastor didn't ask how much people made). All of these church's taught that holiness required that women not cut their hair or wear pants or make up. Men couldn't wear shorts or have facial hair. Smoking and drinking were explicitly not allowed. I was raised in this and didn't know any better.

At 16 years old, our pastor had a vision to move out west so the entire midwest church up and left for a state in the west United States.

Growing up my parents were more liberal than most, and I had a very happy childhood. When I reached 18 I was finally allowed to date. Dating is very strict and they split it into 3 ""phases"" (their term). Because of the distance the church puts on you and the other person, anyone dating is really making a beeline towards marriage/getting laid. Most kids are scared of the world ending and ending up in heaven a virgin so as soon as someone is 18, most people in the church marry.

Phase one is simply talking to a girl. For most youth get together sexes are split and if a guy is seen talking to a girl for more than a few minutes at a time, he better be ready to explain himself to the church leaders. If he likes a girl he can tell the leadership he wants to get to know a girl better and they are officially in 1st phase. At first phase you are allowed to talk to that specific girl and that is it. No touching or hand holding.

Phase two is when you are officially dating someone. You are allowed to hold hands but nothing else. At this point you need to talk to the girls parents to make sure they are ok with you dating their daughter. Most parents require a chaperone at this point since they are allowed to go on dates at this point.

Phase three is engagement. At this point you ask the woman's father for his permission to marry, and then you propose. Kissing is still not allowed at this point. On paper no one kisses before their wedding day, however in practice most couples end up sneaking kisses and more (except penetrative sex) during this point. It also depends on the parents since some parents are super strict about chaperones and some aren't.

I married at 20, which was pretty old, but my ex wife had barely turned 18. We were both kids and had no clue what we were doing. I was required to marry someone in the church so I had few options as to who I could marry (the local church only has around 100 people so during church conventions where 1-2k people would gather, it was a veritable dating frenzy. I was very sincere in my belief of the church and when I married it was to have kids and to keep the church going. My ex wife however had only started going to the church since she was 13 so she wasn't as brainwashed as I was and eventually left me for another man. I agonized a lot over this, and eventually started seeing a therapist for couples counseling (normally you see the pastor for counseling but since she had left the church she refused to see the pastor so I told her I was willing to go to a regular therapist). She ended up only attending one meeting and I kept going at first hoping to convince her to go, then eventually just using it as regular therapy. The therapist convinced me to follow my passion for Latin dancing (dancing was strictly not allowed in the church unless it was ""in the spirit"" which meant you basically marched to music). Dancing taught me to treat women as equals and taught me confidence. Before I was never allowed to touch or hug women I wasn't related too but during dancing I learned that touching is natural and normal.

I eventually left the church at 25 years old, and had my first drink (the church basically teaches you that one drink will get you drunk so imagine my disappointment at my first margarita). I became a flight attendant and married another flight attendant. She has been amazing and has opened my eyes so much. I had to learn to make love again as missionary was pretty much the only thing I knew. We also just started a cannabis based business! AMA!

EDIT: Man it's already 5pm here and I still haven't eaten! Gonna take a little break guys :) I Hope I haven't missed anyone! I'll be back later to answer more questions after we walk our dog!"

"I'm a virgin guy who turned 30 last week, I've never dated or kissed a girl. AMA


The header says it all but to give a short summary, I'm a dude who recently turned 30 and have officialy become a wizard (yay, I guess). I've never dated or kissed a girl or done anything intimate like holding hands. Ask me anything."
