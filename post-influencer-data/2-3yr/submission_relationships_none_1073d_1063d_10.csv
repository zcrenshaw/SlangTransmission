"I [74F] haven't spoken to my children in 20 years. I'm dying now.


I realize I'm older than most here, if not all of you. But internet has been my best friend in old age and I frequent this subreddit regularly. 

I have two sons and a daughter (51, 50 and 44). I haven't talked to my sons in about 25 years and my daughter in 20 years. They chose to cut me off permanently and I respected their decision. With my history of mental illness they had every right to do that. I had problems with narcissistic personality disorder and anger which took many decades for me to overcome and I'm still fighting my demons to this day.

I'm living the final months of my life. I have terminal cancer and will soon be gone from this world. I promised them to respect their wishes and I have for 25 years but deep in my heart I do wish to see them again, maybe to apologize for one last time before I'm gone. I don't know if I am being selfish as I can also apologize in my will. I want to do what is best for them. Will they be interested in seeing me before I die? There are considerable assets that I have which I am leaving all of it to them so they will hear about my death. 

If you can provide some advice about my situation I will be grateful. You're all closer to my children or grandchildren's age and can see things from their eyes better than I can.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm dying and have not spoken to my children in 25 years per their request. I am not sure if I should let them know that I'm dying.

I never expected so much advice and love from you. I thank you all and I'm reading everything to come to my final decision. "

"[UPDATE] Me [30 F] with my fiance [32 M]- my friends and family keep telling me he's not good for me and I'm starting to get confused.


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54z25c/me_30_f_with_my_fiance_32_mf_my_friends_and/  

Thank you to everyone who replied.  Strange enough I think I needed to hear the advice from people I didn't know, rather than friends and family who have been hounding me for a long time.  

I guess deep down inside, I always thought I deserved better but my self esteem has been lacking for so long that I thought my fiance was the best that I could do.  

I honestly believe now that he has many priorities ahead of me.  One of you asked whether I thought he would drop everything if I ever got into an accident.  I'm not sure he would, and that scares me.  

Last night, I gathered up the courage to confront him about everything: the lack of romance, the lack of dates, the fact that he won't pay for anything or contribute any ideas to our wedding, and sadly, he didn't really react.  He just told me he couldn't discuss it now and needed to deal with something at work.  

I'm heartbroken and ended it on the spot.  While I'm sure I made the right choice, I'm still so lost.  I'm 30 and now single.  I wanted to be married by now and have kids.  Feels like I'm starting over.  Hoping for the best, but 40 or 50 more years of what I have now would have been miserable.  

Thank you all for freeing me.  I'm just trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

"Me [27F] in a relationship with [36M] for 8 YEARS. just found out he's living an entirely separate life WITH A FIANCE.


going to start this out now with the preamble that i'm feeling like an absolute piece of trash right now, completely used, raw, and absolutely shellshocked. using all fake names, obviously. i've never posted here so i don't know if that's implied. 
--
I met Ray back when I was 18 years old. He was in a band that I absolutely loved, grew up with. I had even had a crush on him for soo long before we met. You can imagine how excited I was to be able to work with him.  I had a small part in working on one of his music videos way back when (interning at the production firm that he had hired with his band.) We soon started dating after that, pretty inseparable. I would always hang out with them at the studio and spend time with Ray in his place or mine just walking around stoned, happy, and in love. He basically coached me through both my undergraduate and MFA. Three years ago, I moved in with Ray, and that has been the same situation since. I have recently been freelance writing for a couple news publications oversees/working on selling some screenplays to some studios, and it has been such a strain on me lately, but Ray had been being so good to me lately, a total sweetheart. Ray is constantly on tour/working with friends/partners in California (we live in the northeast). I'm used to him not being home or not having a necessarily consistent schedule. I don't really either (I'm sometimes in California myself with some production work I do with my old cinematographer partner.) The arrangement was always nice, and it felt really good to be with someone who understood how hard it is to manage a life on a creative schedule. Honestly, I figured once Ray got back from his business trip, he was going to propose to me. I know that's stupid to just assume that, but after how well things had been going with us, I was really just getting this overwhelming feeling of love and hope that I was just so excited about. 

HOWEVER. 

The other day (week ago at this point), I was browsing Ray's instagram looking for a specific picture, and I noticed the ""tagged pictures"" tab on the top of the page. I'm kind of illiterate at social media stuff.  At this point, Ray was in California overseeing some stuff with his new merch or whatever. I felt myself missing him a lot, so I thought seeing some funny, candid pictures of him would cheer me up/remind me of how cute he is. So, I click on the tab and scroll down a little bit. I see a picture of this cute blonde woman, Catie kissing his cheek. I didn't think anything of it at first. He's a relatively popular musician, not like getting on any charts anywhere, but a lot of people in a specific scene at least know ""of"" him. So, thought it was just another fan. But, when I scroll down more...I see more and more pictures of this woman and him. I click on the picture for who she's tagged as, I click her profile...I'm blocked? Immediately, I got a bad gut feeling. I ended up logging out of my account and into my company's (I know, scummy but now it seems worth it). I click on her profile, and I almost throw up. Basically besides a couple pictures of food, scenery, or shopping haul shots, it's just all pics of either her and Ray or just Ray. I do some more digging and I see that HER AND RAY ARE FUCKING ENGAGED. People are congratulating them! There's a pic of her holding up a hand with a ring up and you can see Ray in the background smiling. I want to fucking die right now. 

It's been 3 days since Ray has gotten back from the trip, and I don't even know what to say. He knows that I'm upset about something, I think. He wanted to have sex when he finally got home (we always have a really fun romp once he comes back) but the thought of it made me fucking sick. I don't know how to talk to him about this. I know I'm just postponing something by doing this, but I honestly have no fucking clue how to approach my future. I honestly still love him so much and the thought of being without him right now makes my head want to explode. I don't even care that he was with someone else if he would just stop doing it and apologize. I understand that humans are not inherently monogamous, and hell, I've thought about other people and even kissed someone one time during a LSD trip a couple years ago. I never told him about that either. But this seems really unacceptable and I feel really disrespected. HOw could he just have this entire secret life and just like hide it...for so many years. As far back in her timeline I scrolled (5 years), they had clearly been dating. I wonder if they've been together the entire time me and Ray were together. 
  

I know this is so long and rambly but I just need help deciding where I go from here. We live together, and I don't really have housing in the area right now that would be easy for me to just *go*, you know? Should I just pretend I don't know anything until I can find another place and then just unload then? Should I try to talk to him now and see what's going on?

"Pastor's son [22M] broke into media department office and stole my [24F] camera and related equipment. I'm expected to replace it because he ""can't afford to buy a new camera and feed his two daughters""


I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom. 

Background: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood. 

The media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. 

A couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's ""just shooting a video, not that hard"". I declined, so he asked me if I could ""shoot a music video for him"" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. 

I hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded ""Alright"". 

The following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. 

At first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. 

During the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes ""the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model"". 

Okay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was ""left open"" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. 

So I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my ""mess"" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. 

Fast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has ""two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera"" and she ""doesn't know where it is or what he did with it"". 

At this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. 


**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.

Edit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:

Among other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  

Edit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. 

I've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. 

There's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one). "
"**Update** Me [26M] with my live-in girlfriend [26F] 10 years, she has lost her sex drive due to anxiety/stress issues. I'm trying to be supportive but the lack of intimacy is killing me


Original Post: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55zq1c/me_26m_with_my_livein_girlfriend_26f_10_years_she/?st=iu45ko64&amp;sh=99d7b298

Hey guys I got some really good feedback to my post that made talking to my girlfriend a lot easier and I'm so happy so I thought I owed those posters an update!

After reading all the comments and reflecting on our relationship I decided the recent lack of sex was not the problem but just the symptom of a much greater issue, my girlfriend's stress. Like I said in the original post, I was weary to bring these issues up because I did not want to add additional stress to my girlfriend's situation, she has enough to worry about right now.

I had mentioned that weekends are her least busy times and that is when we get things done around the house and hang out with friends. Some users said we should focus less on being social and more on ourselves, and someone else suggested that I try to get more done during the week so we can relax more on the weekend. So on Thursday and Friday I got up early and did everything we needed to do this weekend, cleaned the whole house, did our meal prep (something we usually do Saturday) and got all the laundry taken care of. We're finishing our basement and this weekend was going to be the carpet, so I went to Lowe's and bought everything Thursday and banged it out alone on Friday.

She noticed the whole house being cleaned Friday night and was really relieved that we didn't have to take care of it this weekend. On Saturday we got up and that was when she realized I had taken care of the carpet and everything else. It was awesome, she was giddy with excitement because she pretty much had nothing to do all weekend. So I asked what she wanted to do and it was stereotypical Fall couple stuff; went and got pumpkins and mums for our porch, went and got some new Fall decorations and candles and then just hung around the house being lazy. While I worked out and walked the dog she did a bit of work to get ahead so she wouldn't be as busy this week. We ate dinner and since we were in a Fall mood we watched Hocus Pocus. 

On Sunday we slept in for the first time in ages... well first time for her, I sleep in all the time, don't judge me. We continued the fall theme and went apple picking. We came home and I made an apple pie. She started doing some work but after about a half hour she said screw it, went for a run and then came home and relaxed. We went to her mom's for a big Sunday dinner and when we got home I decided it was time to talk to her about her unsustainable stress situation. 

I told her I loved her and was in it for the long term but that I was worried about her and that her current situation wasn't healthy. She started crying, she thought I was sitting her down to break up with her! She knows that the way she's working isn't healthy but she didn't think it would go on this long. She kept thinking to herself ""just a few more days and I'll get into a flow...just another week..."" and before she knew it it's been 3 months and she's still pulling her hair out. I wasn't going to talk about the lack of sex but she brought it up and apologized. She said her problem isn't the lack of a sex drive/attraction but that she's just exhausted all the time. 

After we talked, I gave her a big hug, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex! woo! It's Columbus day today so we both are off and it happened again this morning, double woo!!

Some people had suggested I say we schedule some times to hang out which I was against, but my girlfriend suggested something very similar. Saturday night is now the night we make a point to have sex. It used to happen naturally a couple times a week, but with her new schedule that probably isn't going to happen. Saturday night is now our designated night to stay in and make dinner or go on a date with just the two of us and then go home and have sex haha.

So in conclusion, I'm going to take care of more of the housework so our weekends are less busy and we are going to make it a point to have sex at least once a week. We used to divide it pretty equally but I have a hell of a lot more free time during the week than she does. Also, communication communication, communication. I was thinking this was the beginning of the end, and after a few days and one honest conversation I think everything is going to be just fine. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Busted my ass last week to get all our housework/responsibilities taken care of before the weekend. Hung out and had a great weekend together. Discussed our situation Sunday night, we figured out a system that will work, and then we finally had sex! I'm going to shoulder more housework/random crap during the week so we can relax together on weekends. 

**Edit**: so I guess this post is locked so I'm sorry if I was unable to respond to you guys but I did read all the responses. Thank you for all the support I really didn't think this post would get so much attention!

To everyone who who just said congrats or gave further advice: thank you so much, your advice really helped me work this out. /r/relationships never fails me!

"I [33M] live a life away from people. My family keep insisting that I end it and come back.


About 8 years ago I decided that I don't want to live around people anymore. This isn't about something that happened or me thinking people are bad or other crazy thoughts, I just could never fit with people. I never had friends, but never felt like I needed them either. I think I might be somewhere in the autism spectrum but I don't have an official diagnosis. I'm cool and fine on my own.

I grew up in NYC and finally decided that the environment there is no good for me. I decided to move to a different state, buy some cheap land in a very small village and built a house for myself. The only people I interact with in person on a daily basis are the people at the market where I buy stuff and when something is delivered to me. To be honest, it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm much happier and more comfortable.

I have a lot of online friends. I'm a software engineer and make apps and games. I can work from the comfort of my own home and the living costs are so low that I have no stress about money. I've already made enough to last me 30 more years of living like this.

Now my family are the only people that I have some sort of emotional connection with. I have a more or less good relationship with all of them especially my younger sister who visits me quite often. The thing is, they all say they miss me. They want me to come back living in NYC, they say I should get out of my solitary life and start a family for myself. I can't do those things. And my parents are calling me selfish for not even trying.

I feel really bad when they're upset at me, it feels like everyone I know is upset so I must have done something wrong. I'm not good at communicating these feelings. I think they thinks I'm sad because I'm lonely but I'm not. It's by choice. 

First, do you think I'm selfish? I know they want what's best for me I just don't think they know what is best for me. And second, is it selfish of me to not give things another try in NYC?

[ORGININAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51zki0/my_grandmother_70f_threw_my_13m_homework_in_the)

*Sorry for the late update guys, I have been a bit busy with school and other things. First, I want to thank everyone who has helped me! I have seen a lot of great suggestions and I'm really grateful.*

**WHAT HAPPENED**

As a lot of you have said, I have asked my parents for a lock on my door. They said that they understand what happened and why I want a lock, so they agreed with this suggestion. *Special thank you's to /u/Nekomama12 ; /u/SugarKyle ; /u/ParappaTheRaptor* 

* **Crazy grandma stops entering my room.**

I have told my mom to write a note to my history teacher, she did write it and sign it. I have also told my teacher about my story and he has given me more time to do the assignment. (it's done now)

* **Teacher gave me more time for the assignment**

I have also searched for different apps to save my work, and now I also write it on a computer first so this stuff doesn't happen again.

**SIDE NOTE**: Some people have noticed that my grammar is okay for a 13 year old whose second language is English, thank you! I work pretty hard for this and the internet has helped me a lot, because most sites are in English, so I had to learn it.

  **tl;dr** Parents got me a lock, teacher extended the time for my assignment, I do my work on a computer first, redditors have complimented my grammar. Thanks!

**EDIT**: This seems like a pretty short update, sorry if it's not what you expected.

**EDIT2**: To clear things up about my educational system. I live in a small-ish town from *insert random country from Europe*. The schools here are pretty bad, especially in the rural areas where I live. The classrooms are old, most teachers came here during revolution, so they're still oldschool. Most of the times we have to give handwritten assignments, as if, if we write them on a computer and then print them, the teacher tells us to do it again. Also, the desks and chairs are pretty bad too. All of them are at the same height and I don't fit in them.. My knees lift the desk if I rest normally on the old, wooden chair.. This school in particular is just really bad.. Most teachers are cool but the conditions are just.. bad. *Also, fights happen regularly here, either MvsM, FvsF, or MvsF.*

**EDIT3**: Well, this blew up didn't it? Thanks for the amazing support! Never imagined that ~~750~~ ***1000***+ strangers would be interested in what happened to me!"

"Me [41 M] with my ex-wife [40 F] My ex is now in an abusive relationship. I have taken full custody of our children. I thought it was the right decision but now I am not so sure.


This situation is very fucked to put it likely. My ex and I grew up together, married young, and divorced about 5 years ago. We have two children, both under the age of 13. The divorce was mutual and we managed to maintain a very good relationship/friendship afterwards. We split custody 50/50 and would spend at least one weekend together with our children a month. 

About two years ago my ex met Asshole. Asshole is a terrible person and all around piece of shit. Unfortunately my ex was unable to see this for some reason and fell very hard for him. After about 6 months they moved in together. After they began living together, things started to decline very very rapidly. He began to prevent my ex from spending time with her friends/family. He encouraged her to quit her job and be a stay at home wife, and despite the fact that she was in a career she loved, she agreed. She stated spending 100% of her time with him (he works from home) and basically cut off everyone in her life. People expressed worry and as soon as they did, they were cut off b/c ""if they can't be happy that she is happy, they don't deserve her time"". 

Immediately after moving in together our monthly ""family weekends"" ended b/c he thought of them as disrespectful to their relationship. This despite the fact that he was welcome to join, just as my girlfriend has for the last 3 years. She stopped interacting with me at all ""out of respect for him"" and it got to the point where I could not talk to her unless it was through him. This all went on through the first year and a half. 

About 7 months ago or so he has started extending his behavior to my children. He attempted to force them to cut off people in their lives, even trying to home school them. He started bad talking me/my girlfriend to them and encouraging them to dislike us. My ex started doing the same. 

Then I found out he was beating her. I had my suspicions but before this point I had no proof. Then she was sent to the hospital with very severe injuries after ""falling down the stairs"". The stairs don't give you strangle marks on your neck. I had been asking my kids about this for months, but they never mentioned anything about violence and had always insisted that they liked their time at their mothers house. 

Come to find out it is because Asshole and my ex had basically convinced them that if they ""tattled"" about the abuse their mother would wind up in prison and they would never see her again. After this came out (while my ex was still in the hospital) i immediately took my children and got an emergency order for full custody. This was about 3 months ago. My children have not been allowed back at their mothers place since. I refuse to allow them to interact with Asshole at all. 

Their mother is welcome to visit them in a neutral space, but asshole is not allowing it and she is going along with it. My kids miss their mother and they are starting to resent me for keeping them away from her. I have done everything i can think of to give her a chance to remain in their lives. I have offered to allow sleep-overs at their grandparents (her side) with their mother. 

I have offered to allow her to stay at my home with the kids for the weekend, and my girlfriend and I would sleep elsewhere so she would have the place to herself with them. But she is not budging. She refuses to accept any visitation where her boyfriend is not present. Out of desperation I have even offered to allow visits at her place with her boyfriend present as long as I am able to chaperone for the entire time. 

Even this was rejected since ""it is disrespectful to her boyfriend"". I am at my wits end here. My ex has always been a confident, strong minded woman. She has been extremely successful (partner at her law firm by the age of 35) and has never been one to take shit from people. I don't understand how she can allow this man to break her like this. 

I don't understand how she is putting him, before her own kids. And now my kids are starting to blame me for keeping her away from them. Today, my youngest asked me why i hate her mom and don't want her mom to love them. I honestly don't know what to do. Please, just tell me, was i wrong to take full custody? Should I let her see them on her terms? He has never hit my kids or even been mean to them (as far as I know). 

He is actually overly nice to them, never yells at them or anything. But he actually will yell at my ex for discipling them. While i don't think they are at risk with him, i don't want them seeing that type of behavior and thinking it is ok. Reddit, just give some words please.

My BIL knew what Mike was going to ask him. Mike was not stealthy and asked that they talk alone. But, my BIL knew that when I got pregnant there was a chance he would be required to conduct my delivery as he works shifts like most surgeons and there was a chance I would be at that hospital and need his services as he performs many of the high-risk deliveries. 

Anyway, he went to the legal department and they confirmed that he could legally be my physician and because of the law, and the generalities of my case, he would be exempt from the treating family conditions. So, when Mike showed-up, BIL knew what he was going to ask. BIL, Mike and myself got together and discussed the situation and we talked about what would happen if things didn't ""work out"" with my pregnancy. 

I talked to Mike that night and we went back-and-forth. I think we know going in that this is risky, that I have a greater than average chance of losing the baby; but, if we don't go with BIL, he recommended another specialist more than two hours away. We still felt we'd be more comfortable with BIL and we called him, probably too late at night, and told him we'd really rather go with him. 

He booked me in for an appointment. Mike and I went and we went through all of the information. It came time and he did the exam (downstairs) and I was really impressed. He was quick, thorough but professional and incredibly gentle. I am used to my gyno doing demolition down there and was so surprised I didn't walk-out in any pain. I was embarrassed for a second, but he kept my mind on other things and by the time I realized I was still naked, it was all over. The weirdness was all on my end and it was actually not nearly as odd as I thought and I was really happy we were moving forward. 

BIL answered a million questions, always with a smile and made us feel... empowered. He let us make decisions and we talked about how we wanted the pregnancy to work. All-in-all, we both left the appointment feeling a lot better and more prepared.

"My [13M] sister [21F] wants me to walk her down the isle at her wedding. My MIL told me I can't do it because I'm too short


Hello first time user, I live with my sister &amp; BIL. My father died of cancer last year and I have lived with them. My sister is the only family I have, our aunts don't talk to us because of our mother, but that's not the issues have not seen her in 7 years. My Sister &amp; BIL just graduated college last year as I came to live with them

My sister wants me to walk her down the isle, I still don't know what I am suppose to do except for walk with her and then dance with some girl I have never heard off before. She's one of my sisters bridesmaids and she's my age. She wants to dance with me for some reason, I don't know how to dance. 

Anyway earlier today the ancient one came to visit, my sister was in the kitchen and the ancient one proceeded to tell me that it's wrong for a man of my height and age to walk a woman down the isle and forbid me from doing it. 

How do I tell my sister without causing a fight between the ancient one and her

"Update: Me [21M] with my ex gf [19 F] She has super conservative parents, we broke up a a long time ago but her parents just found out we had sex and her dad just messaged me. What should i do???


Soo i tried making this post a little while back but it was taken down because it was an update... idk.. either way, a lot of you asked for an update so here it is, hopefully this one isnt taken down

Wow, sooo that last post pretty much blew up more than i thought haha, I want to thank everyone who commented on it. I may not have been able to respond to everyone but i did read them and fairly enjoyed some of them as well as appreciated the advice.

Heres the link to the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51igu1/me_21m_with_my_ex_gf_19_f_she_has_super/

So i wanted to wait until after the weekend to post the update because a lot happened and oh man its a pretty good update that most of you will enjoy.

So her dad called my dad and was very ""emotional"" and pretty pissed off that i lied to him in the sense that i not only told him i hadnt slept with her but didnt plan on it... (What else are you supposed to say? Yes i plan on going hard on the paint? WTF?) My dad was pretty taken back and didnt really know what to say. Her dad continued on saying how he wanted to let my parents know what a man whore i was and how i took his daughters virginity and that it needed to be fixed.

My dad just told him he was sorry, he was disappointed in me and he would handle it. He talked to him some more and calmed him down and then hung up and blocked his number.
My dad called me and told me what had happened, (i did not give them a heads up) he was pretty calm about it, for a bit he thought the guy wanted money or something but when he realized he basically just wanted to tattle he just left it at that.

My mom on the other hand called me shortly after and flipped out on me about how i could have gotten her pregnant, and did i even think about what would have happened if she got pregnant, or if i got an STD and a whole bunch of other things. Basically a fun time.

I went home this past weekend to pick up something from my parents house i needed for my apartment. (something that was mine, just couldnt take it with me the first time because it didnt fit in the car) So it was a pretty awkward weekend. I did see my sister and she made soooo many jokes about how one would go fixing a situation like this as how my ex wanted to. Because you know, virginitys are basically sold and given and what not. But yeah thats the update. All is well for now, many awkwards were had relationship with parents is much strained. :)


TLDR: Dude called my parents, tattled on me, went home, got awkward sex talk, never stick your dick in girl with crazy family.

Got hired at the same coffee shop as my friend, Sam. Prior to hiring, she helped me with application and everything.

It was not difficult to get the job, as the manager-friend offered me several times the 6 months I've known her.

Anyways, yesterday I went there to study. Sam took her thirty and sat with me. she told me she only encouraged and helped me with my application because she really, really thought I wouldnt get hired (considered conflict of interest). She then told me ""its like working with a boyfriend. i dont want to see you that much"" (we dont even hang out anymore, havent in a month or two). She said it was annoying that i was friends with employees. She asked our manager friend to only have me work nights (she works mornings). anything involving this job she gets annoyed and kind of upset. but still acts normal despite this, like nothing happened. 

Kind of hurt. why didnt she tell me this before applying? am i overreacting? What should i do? how should i act at work? is it my fault? where do i go from there? should i quit? its not my main income, i got this job for fun and to take up my extensive free time.

Edit: Okay wow I didn't expect this much feedback. Its only been five hours but I've decided that I'm going to keep my job, work my 16 hours, be friends with who i want to be, and be myself. Thank you so much for the replies. I think my friend is jealous. That makes me so sad. I've never been jealous of her (maybe a lil competitive because she inspires me when she pushes herself), i'm always really really excited for her future and all her accomplishments. Neither of us are perfect friends but its clear that the more replies i give and comments i receive, i'm forced to reflect more deeply about our friendship.  I'm not going to go out of my way to ignore her but i am going to just give up on salvaging our friendship outside of work. It is clear that while she is nice to me outside of her (or our) job but mean to me during those work hours, this does not translate to having a good, healthy, and compatible friendship. I'm pretty sad and hurt but I think in the long run, its best for not only me but her to end our friendship.

Thank you everyone -- downvoted and upvoted opinions, i appreciate them all.

ANOTHER EDIT: Forgot to mention, will probably update in a couple weeks or month. My hopes are mainly no tension will be made between me or anyone, I will be civil and truly make efforts to enjoy myself. Even if my decision is ultimate and a bummer for our (or what seems to be only mine haha) social lives, its still a job and its not about me or her. everyones just collecting checks. I hope to achieve these goals in a month or so! Again thank you! By the way, she's not a horrible person...she just can work on her bestfriendship skills.

"My (26F) fiance (29M) says I don't make enough money to ""justify"" not staying at home with our future kids, and that it doesn't matter that I want to stay in the workforce.


First off, I just want to say that I respect everyone's parenting/career choices, and that different situations work best for different families. I really hope this doesn't come across as me being down on stay at home parents, I'm just trying to say that it isn't for me. 

“Dan” and I have been together for two years now, engaged for a few months. We have a very balanced, healthy relationship, and, up until now, have been absolutely on the same page in terms of our individual and team goals. 

I had a hard time getting a job just out of college, so I entered the workforce a year late and am beginning the third year of my career. I work for a non-profit and make about 27k a year. Obviously not a ton, but I feel my career has a lot of potential, and I love what I do. 

Dan got his associates degree in IT and entered the workforce at 20. He’s been working for nine years now and makes about 80k in the tech field. 

Lately a lot of our couple friends have been having their first and second children. Over dinner a few nights ago he remarked how “lucky” all of the women are to be able to be stay at home with their kids. I agreed that it they are fortunate to have the financial freedom to make that choice, but that personally I would hate to be a stay at home parent. He got a sad look on his face and said, “well, babe, we aren’t really going to have another option. You don’t make enough money to justify not staying home with the kids.” 

I was SHOCKED by this statement because I’ve always made it clear that I don’t ever want to be a stay at home parent. I worked as a nanny for a year after college, and although I adored the little girl, I was miserable spending all day every day watching Caiou and reading The Color Kittens 55 times in a row. Working as a caregiver reaffirmed my heart’s desire to someday have my own children, but made it even clearer that I would not be happy to make parenting my career. I LOVE what I do now and definitely would not prefer to be a caregiver 24/7 for the next 18 years.

My mom was a stay at home mom, and we’ve talked about the at home/working mom thing a lot. She hated “being stuck at home doing chores all day”, and, when I asked for her opinion, she said she thought I would feel the same way. (My real dad made her quit working when she had my little brother, because he hated doing anything domestic and also really wanted the status symbol of having a stay at home wife.)

I explained to Dan, again, why I don’t want to be a stay at home mom, but he shrugged and just kept saying that it wouldn’t make financial sense, and therefore wouldn’t be the best decision for the family. He says any “competent” nanny would be at least 50k (twice what I made as a nanny, BTW) and we would be essentially paying thousands out of his paycheck for me to have the “privilege” of working. 

We aren’t planning to have kids for several more years, at which time I fully expect to be making more money. I believe that it would be financially advantageous overall for me to stay in the workforce, which a lot of studies back up. 

I asked if he had a number in mind, if it would be “the best decision for the family” for me to stay in the workforce if I made 40k, or 50k, or 80k like him. He just rolled his eyes and accused me of only feeling this way because my mother does, which made me see red and flashes of a certain Gilmore Girls episode, but I kept my cool and kept trying to politely explain my reasoning. In the end I got so frustrated I went for a walk around the block to calm down, and when I got back (20 minutes later) he was asleep on the couch. 

Reddit, am I awful for making such a huge fuss about this? Dan has been cool to me since this came up, which I’m doubly frustrated by because I’ve always made my plans clear and he always told me to do whatever made me happy, and now he’s the one who changed his mind. Has anyone else resolved a similar situation?

Tl;dr: My fiance says I don't make enough money to justify not staying at home with our future kids, even though I very much want to stay in the workforce. Am I selfish for sticking to my guns about this?"

I am having a constant helpful vs controlling problem with my boyfriend of 5 years. He will do things that seem REALLY NICE, but he does them knowing he is doing something I am explicitly opposed to. Then when I ask him to stop, please listen to me, please stop, he gets mad and says I'm ungrateful. 

I guess examples are helpful.

-I'll be getting on my bicycle to go somewhere, and he will offer me a ride. I will decline for whatever reason (I don't want to rely on a ride, I don't want to be stranded without my bike, I want the exercise, it is a lovely day and I want to ride, etc). And then we argue until I either give in or physically ride away from him to end the conversation. CONSTANTLY. 

-My brother came to visit after his birthday. My gift to him was a fun night out. I made it extremely clear that I was paying for the evening, because it was my gift to him to plan and finance a fun night. Then my boyfriend physically prevented me from paying, and made a big show of picking up the tab and repeatedly taking my bank card away from the bill and forcing it back in my hand. And then immediately did it again at breakfast the next day. Mad I didn't thank him, because I was busy trying to get him to STOP and NOT DO THAT. 

-He asked if I wanted a kitchen stand mixer. I said no, because I like the handheld one I have and I don't have room for a stand mixer in my studio apartment. He bought a really expensive one anyway, and it takes up half of my counter space. Still unused. 

-He asked if I would like to go to (vacation destination) for my birthday, and I said no, I would really rather have a low key day at home with my friends and I didn't want to have any vacation related expenses right now. He booked an extravagant vacation anyway, so I have to get time off work, appropriate clothes, pet sitter...

All of these things have the common theme of being really nice, but really unwanted and really fucking annoying. It's become such a pattern. I'm sure you can see how it sounds shitty to complain about ""My boyfriend picked up the tab at the bar, it made me really mad."" But I feel like it is controlling, and I feel like he just NEVER listens to what I want. We have had this conversation over and over and over, and it always comes back to ""I was just trying to be helpful.""

"I [24F] unfriended a few of my coworkers on Facebook. Now, one of them [36M] is furious and won’t stop bothering me asking about it


I’ve been working at my job for a bit over two years now, and while my coworkers say they’re my friends, we never talk outside the office, never hang out outside the office, and never socialize. 

Whenever I’ve suggested we get lunch or get together on the weekend, they’ve always said no or made up some excuse. They’ve actually physically hid from me to avoid talking to me about going to lunch and lied about me “forgetting” I had been invited to their “all-office” parties (I never have been).

Since my Facebook is personal, and it includes mostly updates about my personal life (selfies, posts with my fiancé, posts about things I’m going through), Ive begun the process of unfriending them, starting with the ones directly in my department.

I started the process after I went downstairs for lunch, but they tattled on me to my boss that my break was longer than 15 minutes.

A few days later, one of the coworkers noticed, and sent me about 50 messages over 24 hours, telling me, “YOU UNFRIENDED ME!” “WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME!” “HELLO!” “????” He did this to me on Facebook, via email, and via Slack. I’ve just been ignoring it.

This morning, I was in the middle of huge assignment, and he said, “I really need to talk to you” in a sarcastic tone and I told him I’m really busy. He kept insisting he doesn’t care and he cornered me until three of my bosses grabbed me to discuss something.

Basically, the question is, how do I deal with telling a coworker we’re simply not friends, and while many people keep their social networks open to non-friends, I don’t feel comfortable doing that?

TL;DR Unfriend coworker I never see outside of the office. He throws a hissy fit and keeps IMing me constantly for me to explain why, interrupting my work and getting nasty to me.

Update: He's become insubordinate to me. I technically have a higher rank than him, and he refused to send me his assignment when I was on call."

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54xuqe/my_parents_54_52_expecting_me_25m_and_sister_25f/

Thank you for all of your advice. Not a *final* update (that won't be for a few years), but my sister and I spoke (and read over the advice), and decided on setting more strict boundaries and coming up with guidelines on how we would help.

We let our parents know that they needed to sell the properties and do everything in their power to get under the debt. We decided to offer up to $30k each (as a gift) if they could show us that they were almost there and had already made every last attempt to take care of it themselves, and that money would be the last step. We also let them know that if they lost everything, we would cover a mortgage payment for a house of up to $230k (a very reasonable place for where they are), but it would be in our names. Our dad was not happy at all and started getting upset again, but I was much more firm with him this time. He did say some of the same stuff again (at the start of the conversation, before we told him our plan: ""your mom and I talked, and you guys can have the rest if there's leftover,"" and after we told him, he started raising his voice and talking down to us. He also said something like ""you should talk to some of your friends, I think you'll see just how selfish you're being."" I didn't tell him about the post, but it definitely made me feel more validated and recognize the statement simply as an attempt at guilt tripping.) I wanted to tell him to shut up when he said that stuff, and I know a lot of people would recommend being more firm on that front too, but he's not going to change -- I'm not going to convince him to stop putting his foot in his mouth, and it's not worth the stress of arguing for me. I just need to remember that it's more evidence that he's handling the situation like a child, and needs to be treated as such. I also don't want to not assist them at all, especially since my mom has been much more measured in how she interacts with us, and I'm helping her out more than him.

I spoke with my mom later and she had more of an air of being sad, but I think she's starting to accept reality, which is what they've gotta do. I explained it to her that I saw two obligations here: relationship and financial. From a strictly financial standpoint, I was making the right decision. You would never buy houses in all cash if you were maximizing ROI, so paying off the debt (even with transaction costs) to keep the houses didn't make sense, and I have also shown myself to be the best manager of finances in the family. From a relationship standpoint, I told her that there was no gap between what she wanted and what I was giving her, and that's why a guilt trip wasn't going to work. They'd have a free house, and plenty of money from my father's pension and anything they got to keep to eat and travel.

My relationship with my dad will never recover completely, I'm sure, but that's life. Sometimes you're forced into personal or family relationships with people who have very serious character flaws. Rather than viewing this as an event that damaged our relationship, I simply view it as something that has highlighted to me one of those flows and forced me to adjust how I interact accordingly.

"Me [25M] and my girlfriend [25F]. She wants to go back to having protected sex (after years of unprotected) because she has a new job where she'll be out of town 5 days a week.


Me and my girlfriend Kim been together for 3 years. About 6 months in, we agreed to have unprotected sex from then on. It felt way better plus she was on birth control and we were both clean &amp; exclusive with each other.

Me and Kim met towards the end of college. After we graduated, we moved in together. I had a normal 9-5 job. She has a passion that she pursued (can't say what because it's very specific). She worked odd jobs here and there to pay her half of the bills, but otherwise worked her ass off to advance in the niche entertainment field that she's very passionate about. She recently got a job with the biggest company in her field. She's over the moon, this has been her goal her entire life. 

This job involves being on the road 4 or 5 days a week, working an extremely busy schedule, and being around her coworkers 24/7 when she's working. Again, I can't say what her job is, but she and everyone she'll be working with are all young, really good looking, and in excellent shape. They're gonna be around each other constantly and there's a HUGE hookup culture within the company. One of Kim's friends (who is in the field and aspires to work for that company one day) joked that it's basically one big orgy.

Kim doesn't start working there for another 3 or 4 weeks, but of course it's all she can talk about because she's so excited. Over the weekend she sat me down and said ""listen, we need to have a serious conversation. Straight up facts - I'm gonna out of town 5 days a week for the next 2-3 years. I would never cheat on you, and I know you would never cheat on me, but we both need to be smart. You need to start wearing condoms again. Again, I fully intend to be faithful but it's better safe than sorry. STDs are no joke. Plus I don't want an accidental pregnancy.""

I was just kind of stunned by this. I don't mind wearing a condom, that's not the problem AT ALL. It's just that after 2 and a half years of trusting each other &amp; not wearing one, she wants me to wear one because she's starting to work at this new job. And again, she's gonna be on the road 5 days a week with guys who are objectively really good looking. I didn't know how to respond to her so we dropped it for the time being but it needs to be addressed. We had sex this morning and I wore a condom to respect her wishes but I feel weird about it because of the implications of this. What do I do/say?

Just want to add that she's the perfect girl and we have NO problems otherwise in our relationship. Couldn't say a single bad thing about her, it's just this one issue.

"Me [22F] with my family who are giving me hell for dating a disabled person [22M].


This is between me and my parents.

I've had a friend who has cerebral palsy. He has movement and balance issues but other than that he's fine. We were friends for two years before he asked me out. I accepted and it was great and we started dating. I really like him. When we became physically close, he told me that he's a virgin and I'm gonna be his first. I found it so cute that he was just honest and open about it. I made his first time very special for him and he did surprisingly well, given his lack of experience and issues with movement! Anyway, we're going strong in our relationship.

So he introduced me to his family and they liked me very much. It was a great day. I loved his family. And I introduced him to my family and it was the opposite. My parents were very cold, didn't take him seriously at all. They were full of disapproval and made him feel he's not welcome.

After he left I talked to them and they told me they don't approve and ""I can do a lot better"". They told me why I am entangling myself with a disabled person when I can easily date a healthy person, as if his disability is the only definable characteristic that he has. We had a fight and left things unsolved.

I need to know what I need to do with my family, and how I'm going to apologize and make it up to my boyfriend. And in the long term how I can continue being with him without letting my family come between us.

She refuses. She says she doesn't want to leave her friends. She doesn't want to leave her house. She wants me to leave my life to take care of her. I have declined and told her she will need to find alternative arrangements then [I have offered to help with a nurse to come help her in the day].

I'm really upset right now so I apologize if my story is spotty. 

I want to keep everything anonymous, so I will call my boyfriend ""Justin"". Justin and I have been together for over 4 years now, and over a year of being engaged. Justin and I both met post college through a mutual friends party, and the rest is history. Justin and I have always had a stable relationship. Both of us have decent jobs, although I am working hard to get a promotion at this PR firm I have been working at since I was 26 (post school). Justin and I met after college/university, so both of us had very separate lives and lifestyles. We didn't actually move in together until after dating for 2 years. The time seemed right, we looked for a place together, and took are time with moving forward. Last summer (June of 2015), Justin proposed to me at a very well known beach on the west coast of SoCal. I didn't except a proposal as simple, yet so beautiful - during sunset to be exact. It was amazing! 

The one thing I can look at now, is that our relationship seemed to be very redundant over the course of the last couple years; especially after we got engaged. Both of us weren't really in a rush to set up our wedding, and regular life seemed to always be the boiling point for us. That being said, our summer project was to set up our wedding for next May. Over the course of the summer, I was taking a lot of my spare time to put in a lot of work for setting everything up. Justin wasn't as involved as he said he was going to be, but it didn't really bother me too much. Our wedding was planned to be a very small one. Mainly just our immediate families, close friends, colleges, and cousins - that's it. We wanted to have more of a ""quality"" or ""quantity"" type wedding. This way, we could actually put time, effort, and money, into people we care about. 

Anyway, I should get to the point here. Sorry, I guess I felt everything I mentioned above can be relevant for your observations of my post. This past weekend, I have been spending a little bit of time with my mother. She has been redecorating and updating her office space, so I spent most of the weekend going back and forth to help her out. It was great bonding time all in all for the both of us. Yesterday, I went back to my place mid afternoon to grab some things to bring back over to my parents place, and something seemed fishy..

I arrived back to my place to see that another car was sitting out front (I believe it was a silver Mazda or something?). I went inside, but it didn't seem like anyone was even home. That being said, Justin's car was in the garage when I pulled in. I walked downstairs to go to our storage area to get what I needed, and then I heard Justin and this female voice talking. I quickly ran over to the area I heard their voices (guest room), and it looked like they were putting on their clothes, chit chatting away. I asked Justin what was going on here. He mentioned to me that this female was ""Cara"", and she was over discussing details about their job - ""coworker"". I politely asked Justin to come over and talk to me. During my talk with Justin, I heard Cara leave through our basement door.

I asked Justin what the fuck was going on. He got defensive and told me that they were discussing a work project. I asked him why they were in the guest room, and Justin replied with; ""I was giving her a tour of her place"". Bullshit; I yelled out to him. I gave him an ultimatum and tell me what was going on, or else I would be staying at my parents place for the time being. Justin finally broke down, chasing me throughout our place, and told me that he had been having casual sex with his coworker Cara for a better part of the month. He then went on to tell me that they had sex 3 times, talked a lot at work about our relationship, and asked her for advice on our relationship. That moment sticks out to me still. 

I ran out of the house and went over to my parents place. My mother knew I was upset about something and I talked to her about it the rest of the night. I am still at my parents place, staying here for god knows how long, trying to figure out what to do. I feel like a chump. Justin has tried sending me messages, calling me, and getting other people (his friends) to reason with me. I don't know what to do. I have invested so much into this relationship, specifically with our wedding next May. We also have a place together.. Money, time, my time, and so much effort. 

I don't know what to do moving forward.. So much of my life has been invested into this relationship, and now it is compellable all for not. Help?
  

**EDIT**: He told me about a month of cheating he had with Cara (emotional and physical), I guess I didn't write this up that clear. But yes, it's horrible.. Thanks for the support, I really appreciate it.

"When my wife [37F] turns me down for sex, it's fine, but when I [38M] turn her down, it's ""abusive"". Married 12 years


Pretty much what the title says. My wife and I don't have sex very often anymore, perhaps 3-4 times a month. I work a very demanding job, she's a stay-at-home mom for our 3 kids. I try to initiate several times a week and get turned down 9 times out of 10. Although it does upset me to be rejected so often, I just say ""whatever"" and either go to sleep or jerk off (I keep this secret from her because she would flip out and it's not a fight worth having). For the very few times she agrees to have sex, it's always great and she enjoys it very much, as do I.


She sometimes initiates but always seems to do so when I'm either completely drained of energy from work/chores or so totally not in the mood. I've told her many times to not initiate when I'm tired, and that I would gladly welcome her advances on weekends. However she never initiates on the weekends (and turns me down when I do), and only ever makes a move when I'm too tired to move myself or in no mood for sex. When I turn her down, she gets very upset and says things like ""this isn't a marriage"" or ""it's abusive to withhold intimacy"". 


Shit like this enrages me because of the disgusting hypocrisy she's showing, and the fact that my wife is selfish when it comes to sex; sex only happens when she wants it. I've tried explaining this hypocrisy to her but she seemingly doesn't understand it, claiming that when she turns down sex, it's because she's too tired/sick/not in the mood (which she considers legitimate excuses), but when I turn down sex, I'm intentionally dismissing her sexual needs.


I'm at my wit's end with this bullshit. She can keep turning me down for the rest of my life and I won't mind, but every time she cries abuse when I turn her down, I feel like punching a hole in the wall. I'm seriously starting to resent my wife and frankly my mind shifts to thoughts of divorce on occasion.

"I [29F] was helping my friend set up a dating site profile and accidentally found my husband [33M] on there in the ""people in your area"" section.


Long story short: I was helping my friend to set up a profile on a dating site for her to find someone new after recovering from a really bad breakup, and I accidentally came across my husband having a profile on there. I'm in shock. We have had our fair share of issues in the past 8 years of marriage and had been attending marriage counselling due to him abusing me in the past, things seemed to be improving between us over the past year or so. In retrospect in the past few weeks there have been some red flags such as him never being home, always being distant from me (he claims this is due to work related issues which I respected and patiently waited to things to improve) and just yesterday he was at the jewellers and a perfume shop with no explanation (he was with a friend so I presumed he was there because his friend was after something). I'm fuming and have a billion thoughts running through my head, I don't know what to do. I know for a fact I want a divorce, but I want him to suffer repercussions for what he has done! I want to go about this in the smartest way possible. I have seen stories over the years of people confronting their cheating partners in clever ways or exposing them and dumping them in clever ways, but my mind is blank right now as I'm that hurt. Please help.

(Throwaway because we're both active on reddit, sorry about that)

Me and my boyfriend are 'highschool sweethearts', and have been together since we were 15. After a relationship of almost 10 years, I am feeling out of love.

We had our ups and downs, but this is more than that. I simply do not love him anymore, and it makes me feel like a horrible person. But I have already been feeling like this for almost half a year, and staying together only makes me feel worse. 

But here's the catch: I am paying for almost everything, as he is still studying and I have a full-time job. He does have a small job and gets some money from the government, but combined with the heartbreak and we live in a big, fairly expensive city.... I don't know if he can handle it.

I talked to my sister about it, and she told me to be selfish: it's my life, I should not feel unhappy for his sake. But I don't know how. How can I leave someone who has no place to go without me?

  **tl;dr**: Unhappy in my relationship, but feel too guilty and concerned to break up.

  **Update**: 
Thank you guys for your support! I still feel like crap (obviously), but I'm starting to realize that I am not a horrible person for falling out of love. 

I will make a 'gameplan' on how we can proceed after the break-up. Some of you suggested moving into separate bedrooms: unfortunately, we live in a very small flat and that is not an option. But we will figure something out, as soon as I get to talk to him (he's currently avoiding it, he can probably feel it coming). 

He's a great guy and you guys are right when you say he's an adult and will figure something out. We both deserve to move on.

"Me [22 F] with my coworker [50s M]. He won't stop making inappropriate comments to me and he finally crossed a line this morning. I don't know what the best way to deal with this is.


**EDIT**

WOW you guys, I did not expect such a huge response.  Thank you SO much to those who took the time to offer advice and even share some of your own experiences with me.  I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to all of you, but I have read all your comments (even the salty ones), and I will be considering all of them when deciding my next move.  Seriously thank you, guys.  Posting here not only provided some wonderful thinking points and unbiased perspectives, but it also enabled me to take a step back and clear my head before taking action, and for that I am grateful!  I will be sure to post an update later this week after everything gets sorted out.  


Hey r/relationships!

I’ve posted here once or twice before and you guys really helped in providing me with some outside perspectives and unbiased advice, so I thought I’d post here before taking any action in my current situation.  Thanks in advance for anything you guys might have for me.


I started working for a new company back in February of this year.  I enjoy the job, nothing glamorous but it pays the bills (ha-ha, I’m an accountant, I make joke).  Anyway there is this guy, Craig, who has been way too friendly.  Craig is in his 50s, divorced, has 3 kids, rides a bike to work, wears the same 5 Family Guy shirts to work every week.  He’s a nice enough guy I guess, just kind of weird.  But hey, I like Family Guy so whatever.  For reference, Craig and I work in different departments but occasionally I have to ask him a question or interact with him in some way or another.


It started with Craig going out of his way to talk to me via our office instant messenger asking me about my personal life like what I did the past weekend, or have I tried this restaurant or that restaurant or whatever. I was kind of glad to have someone to talk to since I was new at this company and hadn’t made many friends yet, but I never told him too much personal info, and made sure to subtly mention that I had a boyfriend.  Either he didn’t get the hint, or he just ignored it.  He started telling me things like “you’re beautiful” and the usual creep-o line “Why don’t you smile more?” and things like that.  I was always polite but my responses would be things like “I know I am, thanks.” Or “Too much work to smile today.”  Anyway, he’s always saying this type of shit and nobody else really seems to be bothered by it.  The department I work in is all men except for me, so maybe they don’t realize how inappropriate Craig is being?  I don’t know.  I also don’t know if he acts this way with any of the other women in the office.


SO ON TO TODAY’S ISSUE.  I walked into work and on my way to my desk noticed someone brought in donuts for all of us.  I was in the break room, pondering my choices between maple bar and lemon filled (I went with the maple bar), and Craig walks in and starts his usual shtick “Good morning beautiful.”  I cheerfully replied “Good morning!  Can’t decide which donut I want.”  And this fuckin guy comes up behind me, rubs my back, and in a half-whispery kind of voice says “You deserve to have two.”  Now, I do not like being touched.  I don’t like hugs, I don’t really like to cuddle, I just don’t like it.  I especially don’t like being touched by older men that I don’t know and who were not invited to touch me.  I think Craig could sense that I was uncomfortable and he said “Oops, I totally just invaded your personal space.  My bad!” and then walks off.


I’m honestly kind of pissed off about the whole thing, because what a fucking douche bag, right?  I don’t need someone else to tell me I’m beautiful or tell me that I need to smile more, or any of that shit.  He could play it off as totally innocent and friendly, but it feels sinister to me.  He wouldn’t tell Bob from accounting “Good morning, handsome!”, so why would it be okay to say the exact same shit to me?  Why couldn’t he say to me “Hey, great job on that project you just finished.” Instead of constantly commenting on my looks?  It’s just gross.  I dread coming to work sometimes because I have to deal with this gross, misogynistic bullshit.  


I want to march into HR and let them know about my concerns, but I’m not sure what the aftermath would look like.  I don’t want him to get fired, I just want him to leave me alone.  Should I ask some other girls around the office if they have ever experienced this with Craig?  Should I go to HR at all?  What should I expect to happen when I do go to HR?  Has anybody else ever dealt with this, and what action did you take or not take?  Our HR rep is my direct supervisor, so we spend a considerable amount of time working together and we have a good relationship, if that matters.


Really any advice on what to say or what to expect would be so great.  I’m just not sure what to do right now.



**TLDR;  There is a dude at my office who keeps flirting with me and can’t take a hint.  He rubbed my back this morning, uninvited, and I’ve reached the end of my patience with this.  Should I go to HR and let them know what is going on?  And if I do make a complaint, what can I expect?**

I just realized I hadn't come back to this one! Oops.

I brought the issue up to my professor after class one day, but I was nervous and glossed over the important parts, so she didn't really understand how bad things were. As the end of the semester was closing in, I thought that was it.... but it wasn't.

Our final project was a thirty page paper. As most of the work had to be done outside of class, we divided the assignment into chunks, one for each person, to make it less of a nightmare. My job was to take the pieces, including my own, and edit them into a final whole.

James, the only group member who hadn't been prodding me about drugs and alcohol, did his part and sent it to me immediately. I finished my part and started working on the editing, but the other members of the group were curiously silent. I sent polite, and then not so polite reminders that I needed their pieces to finish the project. I heard nothing back.

In the end, James and I pulled two consecutive all-nighters to finish the paper. Still no contact from the other group members. James and I went in the day of the deadline and presented our paper, absolutely fuming. It went as well as it could have, even with the other group members around (they were pretending like nothing had happened, of course). We stayed back after class and told the professor everything, in detail. She was horrified, and after examining the paper, failed them both on it.

James and I got a collective A+.

**tl;dr:** Professor is a badass. Group project members were deadbeats in more ways than one and failed the final project. I haven't heard from them since, and I like it that way."
"Me [21F] with random girl in my dorm [19F] making concerning (false) accusations to campus therapist about my relationship- HELP!


I'm a 21 year old female, senior in college. I've been with my boyfriend, 22M, for almost two years. We've had our ups and downs like any relationship, but overall it's been truly wonderful. He's the first person I loved and we have plans to move in together once I graduate. 

Without going into too much detail, our sex life has been truly out of this world amazing. We're long distance until I graduate, but when we do see each other, it's sex 3+ times a day and it's amazing. It's passionate, it's wonderful, I can't get enough. We both like some light BDSM but nothing crazy. 

I use the Mirena IUD for birth control, aka one of the most effective contraceptives on the market. Since we are in an exclusive relationship, we don't use condoms. We got STD tested before ditching the condoms, and my gyno does an STD check at every visit. We are both clean.

Anyway, after a few drinks one night I was talking to a good friend of mine about how great our sex life is. I didn't go into a ton of detail but at some point in the convo, it was mentioned that we only use my IUD for protection. Like a bat out of hell, a girl I never met jumps into our conversation and begins to lecture me about how irresponsible I am being. Maybe I shouldn't have been having this type of conversation in a semi public place, that is my fault. Dumbfounded, I pretty much laugh in her face, truly thinking she was joking.

Well, she wasn't. She went off about how some STD's don't show up on tests, and what if my boyfriend were to cheat on me and give me something? I told her if I had any suspicion of him cheating on me I wouldn't be with him and I obviously have a huge amount of trust for him. She went on to basically say that all men are pigs and I should be careful. Again, I pretty much laughed in her face. Not very mature I know, but I was pretty tipsy and dumbfounded.

It turns out this chick lives on my dorm floor and is the vice president of our safe sex club on campus. 

Two days after this happened, I returned to my dorm to find two condoms slipped under my door and a paper with information about the meeting times/days for this safe sex club. How this girl found my room, I don't fucking know. Yes she lives on my floor but there's a decent number of dorm rooms on my floor! 

Again, really god damn fucking weird, but I brushed it off my shoulder cause I was leaving to see my long distance BF that day, so I was too excited to really care. 

That weekend I was with my boyfriend, things got a little more frisky than usual. He ended up taking a neck tie and choking me with it (totally consentual!), which was incredible but I guess I didn't notice how rough it was being used. That is until the next day I had marks on my neck. Whoops.

When I got back to school it was super late at night and I had not bothered to cover up with a scarf or makeup. I went to the communal kitchen to make some tea before bed and and what do you fucking know, crazy girl is there (on the other side of the room), and one of my friends too (not the same friend from the first incident). My friend made a comment to the effect of ""looks like you had a good time this weekend"" and I responded ""oh you know it"". I thought nothing of it. 

A few days later I get a call while in class from a number I did not know, but I could tell it was a university number. I figured it was my on campus job calling me and I waited until after class to listen to the voicemail. 

Imagine my surprise when it's one of the campus therapists telling me to call her back ASAP. I thought the worst... I thought someone in my family or my boyfriend had died and the therapist was about to tell me this. 

No... she had gotten a report from someone (she could not say who) that they were concerned that I was in an abusive relationship. Someone had some to her saying that I had bruises on my body and that I had made comments to the effect of being pressured to have unprotected sex. WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I told the therapist thank you for the concern but that is bullshit and I am so mad at these accusations and I'm sorry someone wasted her time. 

I was LIVID. In pure rage mode I found this girls dorm room and banged on the door ready to scream at her- lucky for her she was not in her room. I spoke to my RA about the issue, and he said that I am not the first person to tell him about this girl sticking her nose in other peoples personal lives, but never to the extreme of my situation.

Apparently, she left campus the day I went to bang on her door to go home and will not be back till tomorrow morning. 

How the FUCK do I handle this? This has obviously gone beyond something petty. I wish I could have gotten my RA's advice but when I spoke to him we were both in a rush to go somewhere. How should I proceed? Could I get her in trouble for this?

TL;DR- girl is making serious and false accusations about me to the higher ups at my university."

"I (27F) am 8 months pregnant and my fiancé (30M) just shoved me into a wall


I can't believe I'm writing this and feel pathetic that I even need to.

We've been together for 2.5 years and got engaged in the spring. I'm 8 months pregnant with his son and he just shoved me into a wall. 

Earlier in our relationship he was dealing with severe PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Because of his PTSD he would have angry outbursts. He would get set off by even the smallest thing and had a temper that was just nasty. A few times I saw a side of him that I really didn't recognize. His eyes would turn black and he would speak to me with what seemed like pure hatred. Never was he ever even close to physically harming me. I've seen him at what I thought was his angriest and never even slightly feared that he would lay a finger on me.

Regardless, I didn't want to be emotionally abused so I told him if he wanted our relationship to work he needed to see a therapist and a psychiatrist. He complied and within a few months he was like a new person. Emotionally stable, no more anger. I honestly forgot what that awful side of him looked like.

His meds started killing his libido though, so recently he talked to his psychiatrist and decided to reduce his dose. The doctor reduced it by A LOT, which I was apprehensive about, but I figured the doctor knows best.

It's been about a month since he reduced his dose and when I came home from work I just knew something was wrong because he had an awful attitude and just reeked of anger. I confronted him about his attitude and over the course of less than 5 minutes he called me a ""fat cunt"", ""bitch"", ""twat"", ""whore"" and it became pretty clear that he wAs drunk. I was trying to keep calm, but when he said ""fuck you"" in the most evil voice I've ever heard I snapped and threw my plastic cup of water down on the floor. It didn't hit him, it didn't leave a mark on the floor, it didn't break, but he claims he got splashed and therefore acted in self defense when he proceeded to chase me from behind and shove me face first into a wall. I wasn't hurt but it scared the crap out of me because immediately after I run into the bedroom and he chases me and takes off his shirt like he's preparing to beat the crap out of me. I'm sitting on the bed terrified and crying and he won't back off. He keeps getting in my face saying things like ""you think this is scary? I'll show you scary"" and ""next time I'll smash your fucking face into the mirror"".

He eventually left the room, got in his car, and drove away. I don't know where he is now or when he's coming back. I know I need to leave him but I don't know what to say to him when he comes back, which could be any second.

EDIT: I don't think this warrants calling 911. Even though he shoved me into the wall I'm not physically hurt so I don't know if the police would even be able to do anything. He also kept saying that ""I assaulted him"" by throwing my cup of water (which wasnt aimed anywhere near him and didn't touch him beside maybe a few drops of water). The only person I know who lives within 2 hours is his mom, and I'm actually debating calling her to tell her what's going.

UPDATE: Thank you so much to everyone who posted. The overwhelming consensus that this is a big deal made me realize that I was being naive in thinking otherwise. I haven't been able to make many replies, but I have read everything and some of your advice has really been life changing.

I ended up calling HIS mom since she is the only person I know nearby. She told me to come over there right away, so I did, and she actually ended up calling the cops on her own son. Seriously she is amazing and I am so thankful. They came to her house and I gave them a report and told them he was out driving drunk. They never found him or arrested him last night, but they do have the report on file now. 

I haven't spoken to him yet but know through his mother that he went back to our house to sleep it off last night. The next few weeks will be a mess and I'm embarrassed to tell my family and friends about this, but better for it to happen now than after our son is born.

Also: a couple people have asked if I have a daughter in the house because of something in my comment history. I don't. This is my first child. Before we knew the sex I referred to the baby as a girl just because I felt funny calling him ""it"".

TL;DR I'm 8 months pregnant and my fiancé just shoved me into a wall."
