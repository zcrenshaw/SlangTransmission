"My (48F) friend's (41F) daughter (20F) house/dog sat for us this past weekend. She went through our things and locked me out of my computer. I'm furious.


This is the second time she stayed at our house for us. The first time was during the summer. She stayed three days, two nights. 
While we were gone, I'd get random texts asking about something in my house, or commenting on something in my house. I figured she was exploring, but I thought it was harmless. 

This time, Her parents and my husband and I all went out for the night, and stayed the night (planned) so we didn't drive drunk. 

We got home Sunday, they gathered their things and left. All was good, until I saw that their daughter made soup and it exploded in the microwave and she didn't make an attempt to clean it up. Soup was all over the counter, in the sink and in two huge bowls. The bowls were filled with water and left in the sink. Fine, it's a small price to pay so my dog was taken care of. 

This evening I went to log onto my computer and I'm locked out. This isn't your ordinary lock out. I use that computer for work. As in classified information, high security locked out. I can't get back in until tomorrow. 

I tried to use my husband's computer, but it wouldn't print. I have no idea why. He said he doubted she was on his. But since he said he hasn't used it in months, and there were finger swipes in the dust, I knew she used it. Or tried. But she got no where with it. She turned it on, and off. I know this because there were no updates needed when it shut down. It would have had dozens of updates on shut down if it hadn't been turned on in months. 

I've already decided she won't stay here alone again. Hubs said to just lock everything up tight. I say no, because I won't enjoy myself being gone if I'm worried someone is filtering through my personal items, locking me out of my computer. 

I know he's not going to want me to tell my friend what her daughter did. 

What are your thoughts, kind internet strangers? I need an outside opinion. 

Tldr: Friends daughter snooped around my house, and locked me out of my computer. "
"UPDATE: Me (F27) with my fiancé (M31) (7years). We are getting married this fall, and the closer it gets, the more I am considering cancelling the wedding.


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jn78l/me_f27_with_my_fianc%C3%A9_m31_7_years_we_are_getting/

To recap my previous post, I was considering cancelling my wedding because of my dislike of attention, and my insecurities about my personal appearance. I loved the crafty aspect of wedding planning, and the idea of celebrating with family and friends, but my self esteem is very, very bad and I was convinced that I would look terrible and embarrass myself and my fiancé with my appearance.

Firstly, I'd like to report that I'm no longer engaged...because I went through with the wedding and got married this past weekend! It was easily the happiest day of my life and I have no regrets about having the wedding. My husband (!) was really supportive through the planning process and was very reassuring and helped me calm down when needed. 

I did hit a few snags (I DIY'd everything from the table runners, to the centrepieces to the flowers and although I pulled it off, omg was it ever stressful), but once the day got underway, I relaxed and had an amazing time.

This may go kind of against the typical r/relationships advice, but the best thing that I did was to just suck it up, and make myself do it. Basically I used the 'fake it till you make it' approach. I got an amazing dress, and got ready and had my hair and makeup done with my bridesmaids the day of. I was nervous but having them there with me (and a few glasses of champagne) really helped calm my nerves.

Once I started down the aisle and saw my husband, nothing else mattered. He thought I looked amazing and I felt amazing and it was a perfect day with our family and friends. Did I look perfect? No. Did it matter? No. I had a blast, and if I hadn't gone through with the wedding, I would have always regretted it. I know that weddings aren't for everyone, and that's ok, but I knew deep down that it was what I wanted. I'm so, so happy that I didn't let my insecurities prevent me from having an amazing day and marrying the love of my life with those I love present.

TL;DR: I swallowed my insecurities, went through with the wedding, had the best day of my life, and married my best friend :)

"Me [24m] with my entire family, who now hate my guts for being a whistleblower


I hope you'll bear with me here, because I have a lot of family members. I come from a religious community that doesn't believe in the public school system and tends to have a ton of kids. 

I have an older sister ""Julia"" 27f, a step brother ""Ron"" 22m, a step sister ""Molly"" 17f, a half-brother ""Joe"" 13m, and a half-sister ""Lucy"" 11f. 

Growing up, all of us were “homeschooled.” This involved a lot of neglect, lack of textbooks or seasonally appropriate clothes/shoes, unheated house, and sometimes physical abuse. I lived mostly with my mom, but spent weekends with my step family. Both houses were dysfunctional. My step mom used to have a severe problem with alcoholism, although she’s been better in the last few years.

Ron is my best friend and I would be lost without him. We’ve supported each other through years of hard times, and we discuss a lot how our lives could have been different if we’d been sent to school or generally had a more healthy home life. Obviously, we don’t want the same thing for our younger siblings, and don’t want to see them struggling in minimum wage jobs while trying to study for a GED the way we’re doing.

When I went to visit him recently I found that my step mom had gone out of the country for an ENTIRE WEEK and left the youngest two at the house. Ron and Molly both work (Molly hasn’t been doing any “homeschooling” for about 2 years) and are out of the house for most of the day and night. 

I tried to help Lucy with her math homework, but she was extremely behind grade level and kept getting distracted because she had to make lunch or do chores. Joe spends all day in his room playing video games and gets no guidance from anyone. I tried to (as gently as possible) get him to do some reading, but he doesn’t understand how serious the situation is, and obviously is having too much fun to care. 

So I called CPS and reported educational neglect.

And obviously everyone knew it was me.

And Ron told me that Stepmom said I wasn’t welcome at the house anymore and to never contact any of them again.

Molly is extremely mad at me. She blocked me on Facebook and doesn’t have a cellphone where I can reach her.
Julia, who somehow heard about all this despite living across the country, also blocked me on Facebook, and reported my Facebook as impersonating a celebrity, (Facebook deleted it, generally making everything harder).

This stings even more because I’m already estranged from my biomom over my religious beliefs. I now have no family members left (besides Ron, thank bejeebus) who want anything to do with me. I feel like I make enemies everywhere I go.

Did I do the right thing? Ron has been saying for years that he ""can't"" call CPS, and I guess this is why, but at least he doesn't blame me. He suggested that I try to talk to Stepmom once some time has passed, but I would have no idea where to begin.

  **tl;dr**: I called CPS because my youngest two siblings are being educationally neglected. My whole family is now shunning me and I don't know if it's appropriate, reasonable, or even possible to try to reconcile with them either now or when we've all cooled off."

"I [13M] am having a hard time accepting my situation. Everyone else seems to have these big families and I'm a foster kid with no family.


I've just been having a hard time understanding why. Like I was up all night and I was staring out my window. I don't understand why me. I don't understand why I have nothing. While most people at my school seem to have everything. I'm having a hard time understanding why I am where I am. I'm in a new foster home, only 2 days here so far. 

Like It just really bothers me that alot of kids seem to have families to go home too. Then like you can't even escape it watching TV. TV seems to have make it seem like everyone has this family. I don't understand like of all the people in the world, why me. I know some people have it rougher than I do. It's just I try to be a nice person in hopes of being adopted one day. 

There's these kids in my class that go on about how much they hate their parents, for things like not buying them a video game. I just have a hard time understanding why people who hate their parents, actually have parents. Then I don't. The same goes for siblings. 

I don't understand why them, who moan all the time have parents. Why do they get it and I don't. I understand life dealt me a shitty hand. God if I have to hear one more person say that I might just throw myself into traffic. It's like thanks for that captain obvious, I'm living it every single freaking day. 

I have been told a couple is looking to adopt me. I am grateful for that I have met them, but it's just I feel like a puppy in a pet store. You have these couples come in, and you just know they have options. Yet they look at you as if you're some stray to take home. I am thankful, but I feel like I have more in common with animals for adoption than I do anyone else. It's an awful feeling. 

tl;dr: I am having a hard time understanding my situation and why me "
"I [22M] was stabbed during a robbery while out with my mother [45F]. I nearly died and my mother is now blaming herself for the attack and she has been avoiding me. I really need her right now and I don't know how to reach out to her.


Some quick backstory. I am the second oldest child of five in total [25F,me,18F,14M,12M]. I live in a town not very far away from our place but I rarely come to visit my family since I work and study there. My oldest sister is married and lives abroad with her husband while my other siblings are still living with mom.

My dad died a few years back which was really hard for us. We are a close family and death has always been hard to deal with. It could be a 5th cousin whom my mom never met but once she learned of his death, she would be really sad, even though she never met him. So you can guess what my experience put my mom through.

A couple of weeks ago I came home after being away for 6 months. Mom who was alone since my sister and two brothers were staying with our aunt (mom's younger sister) in another town. She was really excited to see me and after a bit of talking, I offered to take her out for dinner so we can catch up. 
She agreed, we got dressed and we went out.

We got into my car and drove to a local restaurant. Mom wanted me to park my car a bit away from where the restaurant was since she wanted to have a nice little walk. I agreed and we slowly made our way to the restaurant.

We had a great dinner and we quickly burned through various topics. I've always enjoyed talking to my mother about anything since she is very well educated and she is really intelligent. Plus she is really funny and I have always liked her company. We finish our dinner and again, slowly make our way back to my car. We parked not really far away (maybe 10 minutes away) and half way through, my mom realized that she has forgotten her purse in the restaurant.

I told her to go get it while I will wait for her in the car. She said she won't be long and ran back to the restaurant. I decided to skip ahead and walk through an alley that would lead me directly to my car. But it wasn't very well lit and my city does have a problem with crime and thefts and I didn't think about the dangers that may lie there.

So I started making my way across this poorly lit alley and suddenly a guy in a hoodie approaches me. He brandishes a knife and demands my wallet. I reach out for it but I didn't have any money in it. I went to show him that I don't have cash and I guess he was kinda nervous and not in a sober condition and before I could open my wallet, he stabs me a few times in the gut and runs away with my wallet, leaving the knife in me.

I fell to my knees in pain and I, again, try to do the one thing I should not, I tried removing the knife but the pain was unbearable. I felt like every organ in my body was being torn open so I fall on my back and loose conscience. I remember that I was bleeding heavily and that's about it. I can make out the guys face and some moments of the attack, but everything after that is a blur.

I woke up a few days later in the hospital surrounded by my siblings, even my oldest sister was here with her husband. They seemed really relieved to see me and my youngest brother was holding onto my hand, pretty tightly. My doctor later explained that I should consider myself extremely lucky since I have lost a great amount of blood and the attacker managed to pierce my liver which made my situation even more critical.

But the doctors did their best to save me and I thanked them for practically saving my life. I was released from the hospital not late after that and I am currently at home, still recovering. My siblings are around me helping me out and so does my mom but I could  feel that something was up with her. Like she was really ashamed to look me in the eyes or just talking to me. She avoids spending time with me, she doesn't want to be around me and I overheard her blaming herself for my situation.

I talked with my sister and she told me that mom indeed thinks this is all her fault. Mom does blame herself for this and maybe if she wasn't so stupid to leave her purse, I wouldn't have nearly died (her own words). She keeps telling herself that she is a bad mother and how she will never forgive herself for this.

I really want to let my mother know that I don't blame her at all. She says that she should have stayed with me and made sure I was safe but in all honesty, if she was with me chances are the guy would have stabbed her as well. We could have both died. I am really sad to hear that she is burdening herself with this, that she is blaming herself for something she couldn't have prevented. Hell, if there is anyone to blame in this, it's me and not her. I decided to walk through a poorly lit alley when I knew that there might be something dangerous lurking there.

So the point I am trying to make is how can I let my mom know that I don't blame her ? How can you reach to someone who doesn't want to be around you ? She refuses to talk to me or even see me. It's driving me crazy. I need my mother now more than anyone else. I nearly fucking died and it's not an easy thing to come to terms with. I am grateful to have the support of my siblings and extended family but what I really need is for my mom to be here with me and help me through this. Instead, she leaves the room every time I walk in or doesn't say a damn thing to me. What can I do reddit ?

*tl;dr I was stabbed during a botched robbery while out with my mom a few weeks ago. We were out having a dinner and she forgot her purse in the restaurant. She went back to grab it and that's when the attack happened. She now blames herself and is refusing to talk or be near me and I am really bummed out by this. I need my mother more than anyone else right now and I can't bear the thought of her burdening herself with this.*"

PS: I was Elle Woods for Halloween :P]

-------

So. Long story short, I go to a really small law school on the east coast. Coming from California has proved quite the culture shock, and even though I've been here longer than a year now, I still don't really fit in. I have my core group of friends who I think will be mine forever, but everyone else at my (400 student) school I've kinda given up on. 

Anyway, this summer I started seeing a guy I thought was cute since last year. We had kinda lightly flirted all year, but didn't actually start ""dating"" till July. Since July, things seemed to be getting steadily more serious. I was sleeping there multiple nights a week, we were cooking and doing homework together, making weekend plans that actually followed through, etc. 

Anyway, last Saturday night was our school's Halloween party. He's not really a bar-scene kind of guy, so when he told me early last week he wasn't thinking about going, I made a naughty reference to me banging on his door afterwards. He told me that would be the perfect night for him. Come Saturday day, I asked him to come have dinner with my friends and I beforehand just in case he changed his mind, and even said my guy friend had a silly extra costume if he hadn't found one (it was a ducky tie and he's blonde - perfect Barney Stinson). He said no thanks, but still wanted me to come over after. Not a big deal. I told him I'd text him when I left the bar. 

10 pm rolls around and my friends and I are at the bar, he shows up with his guy friend. I go up and say hey, super excited that he's there, he is uninterested in talking to me. I shrugged it off, but my friend saw the exchange and went and asked him what's wrong. He told her he felt we were getting ""too serious"" and that his mom wouldn't like me, so he was thinking of breaking it off. 

This was all news to me, and I went home in tears. 

Sunday morning, I woke up to a bunch of texts from him saying he's so sorry, he didn't mean any of that, and he made out with some random girl, but it made him realize he DOES see me as serious and now wants there to be a real ""us.""

I ignored him till today, when I finally picked up after like the 20th time he called me and said I'd hear him out. 

He told me he's freaked out because I wear too short of skirts and it's a huge issue for him. He never thought he could be serious about me (or that his mom would like me??) because I ""present"" myself badly. 

My skirts are not that short. I worked for a marketing firm in Northern California before I moved here, and have never worn anything I would not have worn there. I have never worn anything here I wouldn't be comfortable wearing in front of my father. 

I tried to explain to him that after dying my hair darker and ""dulling my sparkle"" last year when girls went to the admin to complain that I was ""distracting"" (I'm naturally pretty strawberry blonde, I thought going brunette would help me blend in), I found that being myself made me more happy. I let the dye wear off all summer and have started dressing the way I want to again and finally feel like myself. 

In response to this, he asked me if I really have to ""sparkle"" every day. He asked if I can just stop dressing the way I dress, because he doesn't see himself dating a girl who wears short skirts. 

My skirts ARE NOT THAT SHORT. I don't know how much to emphasize this, because they're really not ! They are rarely above my knee, but I have weirdly long thighs and short calves so it's an awkward thing to balance. 

I guess I sorta just wanted to vent and also ask if anyone here has gotten over something like this? Do I just give up? I really like him.. he's smart, funny, a bomb cook, and we have a lot of fun together. But I'm not going to change the way I dress because it makes him uncomfortable. 

Is this doomed?

TL;DR: guy I'm dating (and rest of my school) doesn't like how I dress. Do I get over myself and change?"

"Me [27 F] with my SO [32 M] 1 year, overshares my personal information to ""bond""


I'm a very private person and he isn't, and likes to overshare.  His parents grew very excited about our relationship when we moved in together.  I had asked my him if his family could get to know me by spending time together and letting our relationship progress naturally.  Instead he shared all of my personal information with them (previous ex's, work history, financials) so they could get to know me better right away, and they were curious.  I expect that if I share these types of information with my partner they won't be shared that with others.  I've only met them twice, and they never would have felt comfortable asking me about those personal details, so they went to him to get the information.  We've been talking about it lots and he now says that he understands that I actually meant that I wanted him to keep those details private and he now understands that I was serious.

We've been working on things, and our relationship had improved.  This weekend I shared about my childhood and what had happened to me.  This was a very traumatic and personal issue and I had explained that I was sharing this with him so he could understand me better as his partner but I wanted to leave this in the past, and that this wasn't something to discuss or share with anyone else, including either of our families or friends.

Yesterday he was going for a half and hour drive alone with my Mom to grab my car, before he left I had asked that he not discuss with her that he knew or the details and he promised that he wouldn't bring it up.  When he came home, he explained that he has said to her ""so I got into the weeds last night about what happened to her and your family, and I just want to let you know that I'm okay with it and I won't be bringing it up, just wanted to let you know I knew about it""  

My Mom and I have an understanding that its my story to share if I wish, but considering how traumatic it was on my family and that we've now moved on past it, its not something that she would want to discuss with anyone, or have shared.  She didn't really respond to him and just explained that it was very personal and another ex had once used it against me so that he respect the sensitivity of it.  She's very upset with how he handled it.  He said he felt it would help them bond and that he could be supportive and show that he was accepting of it.  I feel like he wanted to flaunt that he knew.

I've asked him to move out last night and I'm lost.  I love him, yet for me I think this was a deal breaker.  I cannot continue to be with someone who so blatantly disrespects my wishes.  If I establish a boundary he always has to push it.  It feels like dating a child who does whatever you say not to do, just to see if they can get a reaction.  He has ADHD and I do understand that impulsivity is a part of that and something he struggles with.  I don't believe I couldn't have been more clear and the boundary.   

Is there anything that could be done?  I was thinking maybe through counselling, it would help him understand?

Big thanks to everyone who left a comment in the original post. Your input was very helpful! 


I have since talked to Lucas. Again, Miles' idea. His logic was simple. Lucas told me the truth because he was ready to let go and get over me, or rather, whatever idea of me he had in his head. Miles thinks keeping Lucas as best man at our wedding will be punishment enough. As brutal as that sounds, I can't help but agree. Lucas isn't a child and shouldn't be treated like one. I think he knows we're disappointed in him. Worried and sympathetic, but disappointed just the same. If he were truly looking to split the engagement, I feel like he would have taken a more sophisticated approach than drunk dialling me. In any case, we had a chat at mine and Miles' house. Miles was home, in his study working. Lucas and I had lunch in the kitchen. 


To my relief, he did not feign ignorance. We talked for maybe twenty or thirty minutes. He told me he originally wanted to ask me out in university but waited too long, and then stepped aside when he saw that I was interested in his brother instead. He said he left the voice message without agenda, and I believe him. The way he was talking, his words came off more cathartic and apologetic than hopeful. They didn't come off hopeful at all, actually. 


He made sure to say our friendship was still genuine and whatever we've gone through since we met, was untainted. The moments of ""what if?"" were brief, he said, but heavy. By the end of our talk, he was able to admit that maybe his feelings stem from desire for a relationship similar to mine and Miles', and not so much desire for *me*. I told him he's still very welcome to the wedding if he feels he's ready for something like that, and he told me he'll be there for sure. We left it at that. 


All in all, I'm confident everything will be okay. It might take a while before we're normal around each other, but we had a chance to talk and clear the air, and right now that's good enough for me. 


TL;DR - Lucas and I chatted. We're good. Miles is good. Everything's good.

"I (24F) caught my best friend"" (23F) telling hurtful lies about me. We are currently travelling the world together.


I'm currently travelling with ""Linda"" whom I considered to be one of my best friends.  We have differing personalities.  I tend to be straightforward and direct, while Linda has the tendency to be passive aggressive.  We recently met a local guy in the Philippines, and she agreed to go on a motorbike ride with him at around 10:00 pm.  I told her that I felt uncomfortable with her going, to which she assured ""I'll be fine. I'm only gone for an hour"" and left.  Alarm bells were going off and I started panicking. We've only literally met this guy once and we're foreigners in a strange country where we don't speak the local language.  So I grabbed her laptop to message her bf on Facebook and these are the messages I see.

"" I think I know why I'm feeling this way [presumably , this way referring to being upset].  It's because of [my name].""  She then goes on to say several horrible things about me that are just outright lies.  In short, that I'm dirty, lazy, and cheap along with some made up stories to demonstrate how lazy and cheap I am.  When i confronted her, she admitted that none of those things were true.  Not only that, but she'd not only been saying these things about me to her boyfriend,  but also to her other friends as well.  

Apparently, she bottles up her issues and ""picking"" at other people's problems makes her feel better. She said she didn't mean anything she had said about me and apologized a few times.

Honestly, I feel really hurt and betrayed.  My question is, should I end the trip early and just go back home?  I personally don't feel like travelling for the next two months with someone I can't trust.  Or should I just suck it up, try to fix the friendship, and head home in January?  Is our relationship even worth salvaging?  

Tldr:  I caught my ""best friend"" telling lies about me behind my back and don't know if I should salvage the friendship or just end the trip and go home."

Seemed weird, he made it seem like he had gotten in a fight with a coworker he doesn't like, but now I'm pretty sure he just quit.

Anyways... spend all day texting about it, he ends up saying some shit like he doesn't like it here (he moved here to be with me) and wants to go back home. I was really hurt cause I don't think that's even true, but whatever. 

I get home and he's packed up like 1/3 of his shit and immediately starts laying into me to ""tell the truth"". Great, it's another cheating debacle. I got pissed. He tells me he went through my location services history on my Google account (hadn't had a chance to change my laptop password yet) and saw that I went to a hotel and a random apartment. Must be cheating, right? Except I work in a busy downtown area and I sometimes eat at a hotel restaurant. And the apartment belongs to my married friends. That and it looked like the location services was not particularly accurate because I know where I work and it's not where the app thinks I do. 

So he packed the rest of his shit up and left. He eventually believed me so it was extremely depressing. I really wanted it to work out but I can't live like that and he knows he has issues.

"Me [26F] with my sort-of friend [25F], continuously complains that she's either single or dates jerks, how do I tell her it's because she's obnoxious?


Hoo boy. There may be no good way to do this but I thought I'd ask and see if there's something I haven't thought of. 

So I have this friend, who I've known for about 6 years now. We were fairly close when I was younger and had a higher tolerance for bullshit, and I always felt a little sorry for her...she has this ""lost lamb"" naivety about her, and coming from a fairly sheltered background myself, I empathized. 

However, in recent years, she's become increasingly ""Nice Girl."" I really don't know any other way to put it. Every other social media post is about how she's ""not like other girls"" ""guys don't appreciate good women anymore"" ""It's ok though because Jesus is my boyfriend"" (I wish I was joking). It's beyond cringey, and for someone who likes to consider herself a feminist, bafflingly misogynistic. And every time she DOES start dating someone, she dives in headfirst, gets too enmeshed too quickly, posts endlessly about what a perfect precious relationship she has, and fucking surprise, the guy was manipulative/unfaithful/disrespectful/etc. EVERY TIME. 

I've tried to gently talk to her and tell her to slow down when she gets involved with someone, that a guy who gets too possessive and love-bomb-y so fast is probably bad news, but she just gets defensive and says she's a ""Hopeless romantic"" and ""no one appreciates how much love I have to give"". But then she's breathtakingly bitter all over social media, blaming men in general and slut-shaming other women for ""lowering men's standards"" until the cycle repeats itself. It is absolutely maddening.

I don't think I want to be friends anymore, so that's off the table, but should I make a last-ditch attempt to tell her that she's unlikely to attract anything but assholes with her current attitude? As obnoxious as she is now, I hate seeing her stuck in this cycle, and I suspect I'm not the only friend she's alienated with this behavior. Wat do, Reddit?

Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58iyl0/i_21m_am_worried_my_alpha_male_friend23m_is/
Commenters were pretty split on if I should break up with her or not but I definitely wasn't going to do that without trying to fix things first. So I decided to take the advice of one commenter and take her on more dates and get her out of the house. It was a good idea and it seems to have made us closer.  

One time we were in bed together  and she left to go to the toilet, leaving messages open with one of her friends. I couldn't resist. I scrolled up until I got to a bit where they were discussing their love lives. She said ""[my name] has been so sweet lately but I can't keep my mind off vince"". Her friend then asked if she would get with Vince if given the chance. Tia said ""obviously I like him but I couldn't do that to [my name]""
Her friend asked ""what are you gonna do?""
Tia said ""I hope it just goes away naturally but I see him so often I'm not sure I will. I think [my name] knows as well""
Her friend then told Tia that it wasn't her fault she had a crush but she needed to stop it before she cheated.
tia then said ""I love [my name] more  its just confusing""
And that was it.

I decided to approach the topic with Tia. She admitted to having a crush on him and we agreed to try and spend less time at my house so that we see him less. Obviously I'm hurt but I think we can get through it. After reading her messages I'm confident she won't cheat and hopefully if we work on us for a bit her crush will go away. 

I also decided not to talk to Vince since it seems like this was mostly Tia's problem, though his attitude around her obviously helped develop the crush.

I'm still worried that I'll never be good enough for Tia. I can still picture her hanging on to his every word while he tells one of his stories where he comes across as infinitely cooler than me. I could never be like him and it sucks that she finds that sort of person attractive. Oh well. I don't think she's a bad person, I just hope we can work through it. 

Thanks reddit ✌

We've been friends about 6 months and she has 4 kids 13M/11F/8M/7M. One night a couple of months ago the 11 year old stayed overnight. The 8yo started to pester to stay as well, and we let him stay on one occasion, but it was a bit odd as our child (2F) goes to bed at 6.30pm so we essentially sat up with my friends kid for 3 hours. 

Since then he begs me to let him stay every time I see him. I can't tell if I should let him stay or if it's weird. My husband isn't entirely comfortable with it and I feel pressured into having the kid here.

My boyfriend doesn't have the cleanest driving record. He has gotten into at least 5 accidents (1 that totaled his new car) and is somewhat of a reckless driver. I don't always feel safe when he is driving. That being said, between insurance and the new/used car I bought last year, I am forking over a lot of money for the privilege to drive my own vehicle - something he is not contributing to. I drive approximately 90 round-trip miles for work daily and I need to have a car. 
Aside from his lack of contribution, I also don't want him driving my car because I'm not sure I'd forgive him of he were to wreck it. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a grudgeholder. But the man has very little regard for material items with high value.

"My [58F] mother cannot handle the fact that I [31F] am happily single


Throwaway account, as family is on reddit.

Here's my mother: 58, loud, bossy, genuinely warm. Meets you and 30 seconds later knows all your business and is offering advice. Likes hugs (*long* hugs), detailed heart-to-heart conversations, and starting sentences with ""I feel.""

Here's me: 31, autistic. Verbal when I want to be. Don't touch me or ask about my feelings. Seriously, *don't* touch me unless you ask me in advance. 

More relevant stuff about me: I have a good job (I make ~$50k a year), an apartment (I live alone), a car, friends, pets, etc. I think, overall, that I'm doing okay though of course there are things that I think could be better.

I'm also single.

While the *idea* of not being single appeals, the idea of going out and doing the dating thing does *not.* I'd prefer to jump straight to being in a committed relationship. I'm not a idiot and know this is impossible, and am thus okay with being alone.

My mother is *not* okay with this.

Her fears:

 * I'll die alone

 * No one will be able to take care of me

 * I'll be vulnerable as an old person

 * Grandchildren!


My rebuttals:

 * I have friends

 * Nursing homes exist

 * See above

 * She **has** grandchildren.


My mother is also 100% Not Okay with the fact that I'd prefer to be partnered with a woman, and not a man, and the fact that I'm pretty vehemently opposed to the idea of getting pregnant.

Every conversation I have with my mother involves her telling me that:

 * When she was my age she had 3 children

 * If I did my hair/wore makeup/dressed better I could *totally* land a Nice Young Man

 * The other day she met a Nice Young Man who has [Good Job], do I want his number?

 * Children Are The Best

 * Jesus Saves 


In response to this, I have basically stopped communicating with her, except via intermediaries (my siblings are great), text, and terse phone calls. Which, of course, makes me a Bad Daughter and Ungrateful. So she wants to meet so we can hug it out.

[r/relationships], help! I cannot get her to understand that *I am different from her* and that I am content to live out the rest of my life like this.

"UPDATE I've [26/f] noticed some weird things about my boyfriend's [28] behavior since we moved in together


[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52ia3q/ive_26f_noticed_some_weird_things_about_my/) my first post. I got a lot of feedback and PMs, so I feel that I should pop in to say what's been going on.

So...my boyfriend is into pegging and sissification, and overall loves being dominated. He has been seeing a dominatrix, and his best friend has been covering for him.

He has a collection of lingerie, dildos, and prostate massagers, which is what he'd been keeping in the box in the closet.

Prior to confirming all of this, I had come to the conclusion that it wouldn't bother me if he were paying someone to perform certain acts for him; it would only bother me if he'd developed an emotional connection to someone else. So, what wound up concerning me is the fact that he didn't feel as though he could talk to me and open up to me.

I am not completely comfortable dominating him, but I told him that I was willing to use the massagers on him and take more initiative in the bedroom for his benefit. I also have no problem with him wearing lingerie. Honestly, it's kind of hot. That said, I also asked him to go to couples' counseling so that we could work on openness and communication. He blanched at first, but he's come around, and we have our first appointment next week.

Since I don't mind him seeing a dominatrix, and I'm not able to do some of what he wants, I've told him that he can keep on keeping on, as it were. He has said that he's going to suspend his activities until we've worked things out.

This isn't something that's totally fixed by any means, but it's on the path to resolution. And I appreciate everyone who either commented or sent me messages; you are lovely.

Thank you.

  ---   
  TL;DR: Boyfriend has been seeing a dominatrix to express his kinks. We are going to go to counseling to work on our communication.

Edit: Based on responses I've been getting, I thought it would be a good idea to make an edit for clarification.

While I am okay with Craig seeing a domme, I am not okay with the fact that he was lying about it. I need him to be open and transparent with me in the future. If, after all of this and counseling, he shows that he's unable to do that, then that's the point where I'll need to leave.

I see it as something that can be fixed, and I would like to give finding a resolution a try. "

Today my mom was out around town looking for my dad with me in the car once more. She's always crying whenever we have to search for him, mumbling about the bad stuff he has done to her and how she's scared what's to happen next. I've always been used to this, they've been together for 17 years and have been in a toxic relationship for a long time. After she tries calling him but he turned off his phone she made me call him before saying ""this is all your fault why dont you speak up, why dont you say dad why dont you have a job"". I wanted to scream at her and talk back, i was mad since she's always blaming me. I dont know why i need to speak up, ive only spoken up once before to my father that was when he was making her cry in the car with my cousin in the back and it was my grandma's birthday they were off to bury her ashes yet he didnt want to come. After that she always expected me to speak up saying i should do this because im her mother. Im really starting to get annoyed by her since she's chose to go running back to him every single time and she should be used to this by now. I dont care if he listens to me, i shouldnt even have to be speaking up for my parents or anything. I don't particularly like them both, my mom's a hard worker works 12 hours every day with no time off and ive never usually been close to her. Whenever my dad's in the room i instantly leave. I don't like him but I don't hate him. All i feel now is dread i don't want to be with them, we're moving out in 2 days and i don't know where we're going to go, but i dont want to be with my mom. She always  forgiving him after fights giving me false hope that everything is going to be ok and i dont feel like i trust them. I feel like im better off from here, over time ive started to lose interest in everything and now i only lie in bed and just feel nothing but boredom.

"Me [24 F] with my Boss [46 F], she has taken over my life and I am so overwhelmed, I can't see the way to take it back.


I've been working for my boss for about 1 1/2 years now and I've reached a point where I am so mentally overwhelmed that I can no longer think straight or take action to fix my situation. I'm looking for some outside perspective and would appreciate anyone's input. Thank you in advanced. 

I work for a small legal recruiting company that has been around for about 15 years. Last year, we made some amazing placements so business has been booming. There are so many issues within the company but I think it boils down to two issues. 1. My boss is a narcissistic sociopath that is getting crazier by the day and 2. We do not have the system/company structure in place to accommodate growth IE a database/employee handbooks/vacation days etc. 

As of right now, it has become my job to essentially build what is now $10 million company but what I was originally hired to do was coordinate interviews and calls between candidates and firms and Amy (my boss). I was hired straight out of University and my background is in politic science not business. This was supposed to be a job I held for about a year while I studied for the LSATS and then moved on to law school. I work anywhere between 12-18 hours every day and am expected to work a few hours on weekends and am supposed to always be available to Amy. 
She has always been abusive but it has reached a new level recently. Her technique has always been to be very mean and then very nice like she is your best friend. For example, she has called me any variation of the word idiot, told me I should go apply at Savon, that she would blacklist me from law firms in the future. One time I said that I was not an idiot and she said things like ""oh you think your so smart don't you? You think you're too good to work here? And told me to agree that I'm an idiot and harassed me until I agreed. Then a few days later she tells me how smart I am, how great of an employee I am and offers me raise. I truly think I have some form of Stockholm Syndrome.

Last October, I did try to quit. My mom has Borderline Personality Disorder and possibly PTSD that has been undiagnosed/untreated for 40+ years. I originally took this job when I graduated college so that I could support her as she was let go from her professorship after a mental breakdown. Before she had the breakdown, she (at least I thought) seemed like one of the strongest/smartest people I knew. She is on disability but barely gets any money (or that's what she told me) and needed my help. Then last October on a Sunday she tried to kill herself. I got word from my uncle and immediately let Amy know I needed the next day off so that I could drive to my mom (about two hours away) and be with her. Amy told me that if I did not show up the next day, I would not get a letter of recommendation. I told her to stick it where the sun doesn’t shine and hung up. I spent the next two months with my mom and right when I started looking for a new job I got a call from my old coworker promising the company had changed and that I would work directly under her and I wouldn't deal with Amy at all. I loved my coworkers before, would start at the same rate I left and would not have to deal with Amy so I signed right up. WRONG. Amy miraculously loved me again and only wanted to work with me - Basically I had my old job back. 

The reality is Amy cannot handle the stress of a successful company and has been so mean that no one we hire has stayed more than 2 - 4 months. Every day I speak with her for over an hour and have to hear about what I'm doing wrong, that I need to sound pleasant/happy when speaking with her, that I'm stupid for not understanding every side of the company or that one of my coworkers is an idiot and that's my fault. My coworkers and I have formed into a mini family of abused victims which makes it all the more difficult to just quit; particularly for my coworker Ariel. She trained me and has been working here for 2 years. She is so mentally drained from Amy, is fully addicted to Adderall to keep up with the work load and alcohol to get through her conversations with Amy that I truly believe she would die if I left. Before I took the job, 15 people in the previous year have come and gone from my role. 

To be honest, I am just so tired and sad. I don’t recognize myself anymore. I have kept this job because of my parents who need money, my coworkers who need my support, to pay for the bills/save up for law school and to save for a charity race I am doing in June. If I could last until June then I would feel better about leaving since it is an actual reason to leave rather than I just can’t take it anymore. I know that abuse is a reason to leave but I feel like I came into this job the second time knowing it was a possibility so its not a justifiable reason to leave. 

All I want to do is crawl onto my mama’s lap and have her hold me like she used too before she had a mental breakdown and tell me everything will be ok. I miss her so much. I am starting to hate myself for not having the spine to quit. I have never been this person; always priding myself on my own strength and yet I can’t even quit. Also, it is an awkward time to quit as I would only be able to have a job until June so any place that would pay me enough to support my bills probably won’t want to invest the time to train just for me to leave. 

I have always wanted my life to be dedicated to the betterment of society but if I can’t even handle this, how can I expect to ever work in politics and make those tough decisions? I don’t understand myself anymore. 

I am hoping you all could give me ideas/advice on what to do. I apologize for the length of the post and appreciate anyone who made it this far.

Hi guys, I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to post to as it's about a friend and not me. But I was really hoping for some advice and how to support my friend and point her in the right direction. She doesn't reddit. 

This story started a long time ago and my friend originally met Twin Flames guy when she was 16 and he 30. Apparently he was obsessed from that point on, which is extremely inappropriate in hindsight. 
My friend saw him only as a friend and had absolutely no romantic dealings with him. She agreed to meet him on several occasions for 'coffee' or 'acting classes' but then he'd pick her up and suddenly the plans would change to dinner and dates. 

There's a lot more to the back story and eventually my friend realised that it was creepy and wrong and stopped seeing him, however occasionally still had contact with him through out the next 6 years. 

My friend had never disclosed this to anyone until recently, and they said it sounded like she had been, or was in the middle of being groomed. She quickly sent TF guy a message and asked to cease all contact. 

Since then, things have escalated. He's been posting weird videos on YouTube about how he met his Twin Flame when she was just 16 and now the time is right. It's his 'God Given right to be with her' and it was his for the taking. 
She also has evidence he turned up outside her house at 3am one morning and just stood there. 

What can she do? How can I help her? 

TL:DR Friend might have been groomed when she was 16 by Twin Flames cult member, now six years on he's still posting videos about her and his ""God given right to be with her'."

"Something weird is going on with my neighbors (30s-40s m/f) but they're deaf, help! (UPDATE)


Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55h26f/something_weird_is_going_on_with_my_neighbors/

I've been waiting to see if anything more crucial would happen but so far it doesn't seem that way, so I figured I'd update you guys. 

I'd like to clarify some things from my original post first though. A lot of you were super upset I didn't call the cops when the wife's husband beat her. When i said he was RIGHT there, I meant it. I was standing in her doorway and he was in their front room staring daggers at me. I'm a tiny woman and he scared the shit out of me. If I ran home and called the cops, he would've known for sure it was me and I was (and still kinda am) afraid of retaliation. This is America, everyone has guns guys. It was a bad decision yes but In the end my and my family's safety goes before anyone else's, period. Also, I got a lot of ""why does is matter if they're deaf?!"" Comments. Communicating with the adults was hard and it often took 10-15 mins to get a 30 second convo clarified through lip reading, them speaking, me trying to figure out what they said, etc. I also got a lot of info second hand from the kids and it was hard to get stories straight. There's a lot of stuff I even left out of my OP because it's just so.damn.much.  I wasn't comfortable texting anymore because it always was gimme gimme gimme. Anyways, on to my update. 

So we called CPS. Told them everything. The kids begging for food, the beatings, the wife begging for money/food/toiletries, and how the youngest boy seems to be a scapegoat. They took all of our info and said they'd be in touch if necessary. 

However I think someone already called CPS, because not long after my post some man in a suit escorted by a Police Officer came to their house and left after about an hour. But my thinking is the more people reporting this, the better, so the kids and wife can get some help. 

Wife and kids have been back for awhile, thank god. The husband has been gone for about a week now, I think the wife finally kicked him out. One of the youngest girls was hospitalized because she got into scapegoats ADD meds and overdosed?! (This is all second hand info I could gather from the kids) she's out now. I feel terrible for her and hope the hospital called CPS as well. I find it fishy she got scapegoats meds, since everyone blames him for everything. I'm gonna call CPS again and tell them about this, it just happened a few days ago. 

We now occasionally sneak food to the kids when we can (we've now seen with our own eyes that wife and her brother and brothers gf literally take the food we give the kids and eat it themselves), but we've stopped giving the adults anything. So, basically, everything is still a hot mess over there but we're now reporting what we see and cutting contact with the adults. We also now suspect the adults are drug addicts, for reasons anyone who's been around addicts will know (nodding out, running through money with nothing to show for it I.e. Food toilet paper etc) this is also a fairly new thing I'm going to tell CPS about again. 

Well, I think that's all, it's a new drama everyday with my neighbors and honestly it's exhausting me, but we're doing what we can while still maintaining boundaries.

"My mother in law [53 F] is ruining mine [25 F] and my husbands [26 M] life by interfering with our childs [3 F] upbringing


Hopefully Im posting to the correct sub because this is both a family issue and a relationship issue as this is really affecting my marriage. 

Long story short, ever since our daughter was born my husbands mother has seemed to make it her aim to prove we're irresponsible and inadequate parents. Almost every day there's a new problem; my daughters shoes are ""too small"", the night light we use is ""too bright"" etc etc. Every single time I have seen her (which unfortunately is a couple of times a week) there's a new made up issue she's suddenly got with the way we're bringing up our child. 

Me and my Husband are good parents, we make sure our daughter has everything she needs and everybody tells us how much of a happy child our daughter is and how she's a credit to our hard work. But for some reason almost everyday, either in person or over the phone, I find myself having to defend myself and my parenting choices. And then even after that she will come to our house without warning  and she'll have bought items she thinks we need (like a different night light, different shoes, food she thinks my child should be eating) and completely undermines me.

 Me and my husband are so so tired of this now. No matter what we say it never gets better, she never listens and she never respects us enough to leave us alone and be happy in the knowledge we're doing a good job. She's single and lives on her own and quite frankly I don't think she has anything better to do. 

Any advice on what we can do would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 

TLDR: my mother in law has made it her duty to undermine my parenting and make me out to be a bad parent. Advice?

EDIT: Thank you everybody for your fantastic advice and support. I will definitely be setting up harsh boundaries from now on with help from my husband and hopefully things will improve"
