"MOD POST: NO MORE THINLY VEILED VALIDATION POSTS


Sup Shitlords,

We've been seeing a lot of posts seeking validation for doing the most mundane things possible including but not limited to:

* Asking if wearing sports bras at the gym is okay

* Asking if guys are attracted to larger bellies

* Asking if guys are attracted to women wearing heels

* Asking if guys are attracted to women wearing glasses

* Asking if guys like women who lift

* Asking if guys like women who DON'T lift

* Asking if guys like women who play sports

* Asking if guys like women who like video games

* Asking if guys like women who read and don't watch TV

* Asking if guys like women who don't use social media

* Asking if guys like women who use social media a lot

* Asking if guys like women who use social media occasionally

* Asking if guys like women who watch porn

Jesus christ, are you so insecure that every single thing you do must trigger some primal fear inside you that you are unlovable?  If that is the case, then you are probably beyond help from the whiny virgin teenagers that comprise Askmen.  Asking us if you're attractive is like asking coal miners if your kitchen is clean; the opinion you want holds little value because you don't want them in your kitchen to begin with.

The answer to all of these questions is yes, some guy is attracted to that, and you need to chill out.  But also, all of these questions are just trying to seek validation from a group of whiny virgins all too eager to give it to lonely manic pixie dream girls.  So from here on out, we're banning thinly veiled validation questions.  The answer to all of them is ""some guy will find you attractive, get off the internet and find him"", and they're only contributing to the AskMen pity party.  

Have a Nice Day,

The Askmen Mod Team"

"My girlfriend's cat is getting put down in a week, how do I give that cat the best week of its life?


My girlfriend has been in a different city for the past six months, and I've been left to take care of her childhood cat. I usually hate cats, but goddamnit has this kitty melted my cold heart. The cat has been suffering from some poor health as of late, and is getting put down in a week. 

How do I show this pussy the best goddamn week of its life?"

"What is your infamous ""but I meant it as a compliment"" moment?

"What is the classiest way you've been rejected?


The ""Cruel Rejections"" thread is bringing me down. What are some classy, kind, mature, and otherwise nice ways you've been turned down?  

I've got two. First was with a girl I met while out with some friends - we exchanged numbers and hung out once more before I started crushing on her. When I asked her out, she said, ""It would be fun to hang out with you again, but to be honest I think we're on different pages."" It let me know that I was good company, but she wasn't interested in entertaining anything beyond that.  

The other was with a girl in my weekly dance classes I used to take. Got to know her over the course of a few weeks. I asked her out, and she said, ""I'm sorry - I joined this class to just sort of be...my thing, you know? That's really sweet, but I don't want to complicate anything with this class."" Fair enough, and she actually sounded kind of flustered when she told me that. Rejecting someone in person isn't an easy thing, and while I don't condone the behavior, I can understand people's vagueness or acts of fading/ghosting when it comes to turning someone down. 

So what about y'all?"
"Men - What kind of weird bachelor shit have you started to do after living alone for awhile?

"Are women generally aware about how low most men's self esteem is?


I didn't really roll it over in my head until now, but I think most men (At least in the States) have such a poor self image that if an attractive woman approached them they'd assume it was some kind of joke or they were being screwed with.

But are women aware of that being the case? Is that a common knowledge thing?"
