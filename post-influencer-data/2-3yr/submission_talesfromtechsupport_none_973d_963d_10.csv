"I'm pretty sure I knocked a user out from nearly 300 miles away


I work Helpdesk for a retail store chain in the UK. I had a call from a store about a till drawer that wasn't opening after a transaction.

&gt;me: Could you check that the till is plugged in to the back of the pc?

&gt;user: Sure, one second.. (I hear him rummaging under the desk)

&gt;user: yeah, It's plugged in

*The POS software occasionally forgets which COM port to operate for the till drawer*

&gt;me: I'm just going to try to open the drawer manually. Can you stand back from the drawer so it doesn't hit you.

&gt;user: haha, sure!

*I open up CMD and try to open the drawer*

    echo a&gt; COM1

*... nothing*

    echo a&gt; COM2

**UGHHHHH.. Thud**

&gt;me: Hello? I heard something, did the drawer open?

&gt;user: ...

&gt;me: Hello?

*After around 20 seconds a woman picks up the phone laughing*
&gt;user2: *User* had to go to the bathroom to clean his nose, the till drawer hit him in face and bust his nose. We'll call you back later!

Whenever I want to reach through the screen and smack a user, I'll always think back to this story and remember that it's possible."
"Liz I don't like you like that


This happened during my tenure as a T1 at a mid sized call center in 2001.  Like most call centers a ticket was required for any IT problem mainly because we had around 500 users on line at any one time.  Most of the users understood this and followed the rules pretty well.  Except for the new supervisors. Most were in their early 20s and it was usually their first time in any type of position of power (hey they now got an inbox/outbox and their own stapler they must be important).  

Liz lived up to this to a ridiculous degree,  every problem led to a panicked call to us followed by a dash to our office when told  to open a ticket.   ""This has to be fixed right now"" she would wail ""I'm a supervisor"".  Since most of her problems would be resolved with a couple of key strokes I decided to nip this problem in the bud. 

As soon as she would call I knew I had a couple of minutes as she made a mad dash down the stairs to pound on our door to plead her case in person.   Now Liz was just a stunningly good looking girl so most of my co-workers (also in their 20s and as awkwardly nerdy as you would imagine would jump to help her). I however was in my early 40s and fortunately immune to her looks.  So I took to using remote desktop to fix her problem while I knew she was heading towards our office (locking her computer was not necessary I guess). I would begrudgingly follow her upstairs to ""see"" the problem which was already fixed.  She would swear that it wasn't doing whatever before and that it must have fixed itself.   

After about the fifth time I did this I dropped this on her.  ""Liz I'm a happily married man and I just don't like you like that"". ""If you don't stop trying to get me alone like this I'm going to have to go to HR"". 

Liz started using the help desk after that and me at my co-workers shared a laugh every time one of her tickets came in."
