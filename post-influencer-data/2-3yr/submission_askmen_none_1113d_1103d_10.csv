"What would you think if a girl had to tell you she was dead in the middle of hooking up?


EDIT: *DEAF* not dead OH MY GOD. I'm on mobile and I don't know how to change the title...gonna go crawl in a hole now. 


Sorry I know this sounds ridiculous...

I'm deaf and wear cochlear implants. Most people don't know unless they see them on my ears (when I'm wearing my hair up) or I tell them. 

Things get a little...awkward...when I am with a guy. I LOVE it when his hands run through my hair until the cringe-inducing moment when he knocks my magnets off and I suddenly go deaf. Some guys Ive been with, they already knew about it, and I would just take them off since they fall off when I am, well, horizontal. 

Anyways, it just seems like a weird, awkward thing to deal with in the midst of an already potentially awkward, intimate moment between two people. 

What would you think if something like this (having to do with a ""handicap"") happened to you? 

Edit 2: I tried to summarize answers to a bunch of questions and clarified some things in a comment. I don't know how to make it more visible though. Also, I don't sign - never been a need since I can hear and speak clearly. 

EDIT 3: CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THERE IS A GHOST BY MY TITLE/QUESTION/WHATEVER"
"Guys who pee on the seat of the office toilet and then don't clean it up, therefore creating a situation where someone else literally has to clean up your piss. What was the moment in your life that made you into the failure you've become?


EDIT: They are overcompensating for having tiny penises. Makes perfect sense and I should have known. Thanks everyone!"
"People who actively worked on themselves before getting into relationships, what did you do and achieve?


"
"What do you look for in a girl, necromancy-wise?


Do you judge a woman by how many corpses she has enslaved, the diversity of corpse-types, how powerful her corpses are, her ability to commit mass murder with magic, or whether or not she is a lich? "
"How do I stop looking at girls when they wear leggings?


Sometimes I wish they were never mainstream girl fashion. 

Edit: I didn't expect this shit to get far"
"Bisexual guys who have had a relationship with both women and men, what are the things that you can do with your girlfriend but not boyfriend, or with your boyfriend but not girlfriend?


Similar to the question posed over on /r/askwomen, it got a TON of interesting responses, and I'd love to get the male point of view."
"What is your immediate perception of a woman that has no social media or online presence?


I have been on a couple of dates with this girl I met at a concert, and she told me that she has no Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter, no anything. It's actually the first time I have gotten to know someone that has absolutely zero online presence. When I asked her why, she just said ""I don't need that shit in my life"".

In your opinion, is that a red flag or not?"
"How common is it for men to believe that sexual partner count influences how a woman's vagina looks/feels?


I always assumed the jokes about ""meat flaps"" occurring from a high sexual partner count weren't serious and if they were, it was only coming from boys who didn't yet understand human anatomy.  But the other night a male friend of mine (who is 30) was telling me he slept with a girl who had big inner labia and he said ""To be fair, she's been with a lot of people, I'm sure they weren't always like that.""  This guy is really smart and went to a near-Ivy level university.  When I pointed out to him that I have sex with my husband more often than any single woman has sex with one night stands, and by that logic mine should be completely wrecked (but it looks the exact same as it always has) it kind of dawned on him that this makes no sense and then was like ""Yeah, but still, I think being with a lot of guys changes things and stretches a woman out.""

My husband was sitting next to me during this, and later when I brought it up with him he goes ""You're obviously right, but up until then I thought the same thing too.""  My husband is also a grown ass man, very smart, went to a great college, and (I thought) knew a lot about female anatomy from being with a woman for nearly a decade.

Is this something most men actually think, and how on Earth do they believe this makes biological sense?  Even if sex changed the vagina permanently (which it doesn't), why on earth would the number of partners, as opposed to the actual amount of sex, be the issue?"
"Paternity: Guys who found out their child/ren weren't actually theirs - How did you find out?


What was it that lead you to question the paternity of the child? Was there one event, or a series of things that lead you to wonder? Did you find out through guess work (appearance/blood type/etc) or did someone tell you/cast doubt for you? What's your story? 
"
"Have you ever told an unattractive friend who was unsatisfied with being single to lower their standards? How did that go?


Have you ever told a friend or family member who was, lack of better terms, unattractive and unsatisfied with being single to go for girls or guys that are more in their league? How did that go?

I have friends and family members who are tired of being rejected by people they find physically attractive, but it hasn't occurred to them that maybe they're not high enough on the social ladder. "
"Why do you think male bisexuality is so uncommon and stigmatized compared to female bisexuality?


Feels like almost all female celebrities claim to be bisexual: Megan Fox, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, etc. The list is endless. And if a girl claims to have experimented in college, no one blinks an eye - it's just considered normal for girls to do.

Now, flip the switch - I cannot think of a single openly bisexual male celebrity. I also don't know any openly bisexual men in real life. And I never hear stories of straight/bi-curious guys experimenting. They might do it, but they tend to *very* secretive about it. There's a very significant stigma surrounding this.

Why do you think there is such an incredible difference between the way society deals with male bisexuality compared to female bisexuality?"
"Those who are ""unsuccessful"" in their careers, what is life like?


I'm 31 and life is lining up to be that way. I face several issues (social awkwardness, anxiety, confusion) that are starting to appear to be limiting factors. 

Right now I""m the least successful of all my high school or college friends. :(

Does anyone feel the same way? What is life like? Do you struggle to pay the bills? When you meet people and they ask the inevitable ""What do you do"" do you feel embarassed?"
"Have you ever been in a relationship where no one could figure out what you saw in your SO? What did you see in your SO and why could no one else understand it?


"
"How intensely do you feel emotions? Am I ""insensitive""?


Lately, I feel like I'm kind of insensitive. Not in a a way that makes me act like a jerk or anything like that. I have healthy relationships with friends and family.

I just feel like I don't feel some emotions as strongly as others. For example, my brother recently had a daughter and I became an uncle. I visited my niece at the hospital and while I was happy for him, I didn't feel an intense feeling of love or connection to the child. I thought ""hey that's a cute baby"" but felt a bit indifferent as well. Meanwhile, my sister was super excited, happy and loving.

Another example, I don't feel the need to be in a relationship like some of my friends. I've never had a girlfriend. Sometimes I'll see a couple or a nice looking girl and think it would be nice, and sometimes I'll feel indifferent. When I sleep with a random girl I meet with whom I felt a connection that night, I usually don't feel like seeing her again as I seem to find little traits that annoy me and know it's not worth pursuing.

What do you guys think? Is this just a normal part of being a man and maturing as an individual or have I become a bit jaded?"
