"TIFU by changing a client's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu


This just happened 2 hours ago.


I work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


I had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled ""sexy pikachu"". Found [the one](http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.


I quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client's computer. You changed their background, not mine.""


I shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she's the owner's daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. He's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


I stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say ""Ok, send her over to me."" I'm a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it's really best I talk to her.


I answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what's going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""Hey, I'm locking my computer for you"" or ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


TL;DR Tried to change coworker's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager."
"TIFU by watching That 70s Show


I live with my boyfriend and his parents, we all get along great and I couldn't be happier. Today, I had just come off a gruelling 15 hour shift, I was exhausted but I wanted to spend some time with my boyfriend before bed, so we put on the TV. That 70s Show was on, popular show in this household, we both sat down to watch. 

SPOILER ALERT

It was the episode in which Eric and Donna break up. 

Being the soft hearted human I am, I begin to tear up, and between the sheer level of tiredness I feel, the heartbreak on TV and the relentless teasing of my boyfriend, I begin to start hysterically sobbing. I ran up the stairs to the bathroom, passing his mother on my way, who stopped me to ask what was wrong. I tried to explain the fictional TV break up through my tears, and of course the only words she heard were ""break up"". 
She started to cry, she shouted to her husband to ""come quick, something has happened"" and she held me tight and told me I will be okay, she ran downstairs to check on my ""ex""boyfriend. Subsequently, he thinks it's hilarious and decides to play along, acting like there was a huge dramatic break up scene between the two of us and that it's all over with no chance of reconciliation. Neither me or his mother can speak for crying, he's laughing like an absolute maniac and his father is nowhere to be seen... 
As it turns out, he was showering when his mother screamed for him, he jumped to get out of the shower, slipped, fell, broke his ankle, tried to stand up again, slipped again and face planted the edge of the bath and broke his nose. 
(Edit: boyfriends father is on the mend and thinks this is the funniest thing to ever happen) 

TL;DR I cried at a TV show, accidentally convinced my boyfriend's mum I had broken up with her son, and his dad broke an ankle and his nose trying to help. 
(Edit 2: I can't believe I have got gold for this! I knew one day being over emotional would get me somewhere, haha!! Thanks to everyone who commented and voted, so glad my FU made you all smile) "
"TIFU my first date.


I'm a very socially awkward person.

So when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!

The night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

I get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.

Here's where it went south.

We're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, ""I got this.""  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying ""Oh, you don't have t-"". 

I cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a ""After you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

Without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

Maybe next time."

"TIFU by releasing a bunch of eels in the kitchen.


This happened when I was a kid but the fuck-up came back to haunt me not too long ago. 

When I was young I was extremely infatuated with animals. I was forever bringing home stray cats and injured birds. My dad, a rough trawler fisherman all his life, couldn't understand his daughters obsession with  animals. He believes animals are for food, not cuddling. 

And this is how what is now known in our family as the 'Eel Incident' came to be. 

One day my dad brought home a bucket full of eels he caught from our local lake together with one of our neighbours. Smoked eel is a local delicacy where I'm from, so that what my dad and his mate planned to do with their catch. They were pretty chuffed with themselves, cracked a few celebratory beers outside whilst cranking up the smoker. 

Whilst my dad and his friend were getting drunk outside I decided to have a peak at their catch in the kitchen. I peeled the lid off the bucket and was surprised to discover the 30+ eels in the bucket were still alive, just wriggling and sliding in a giant slime ball. 

My bleeding heart immediately kicked in. Those poor eels! They don't even have water! How are they supposed to breathe?! 
So I sprung in action and threw a pan full of water in the bucket. The eels liked it, they wiggled more. Another pan. More movement. 
I was delighted...  Until one of the bigger eels broke loose from the ball and managed to slide over the edge of the bucket. 

Drats. I hadn't anticipated that. And I realised I was in lots of trouble if my dad found out I tampered with his catch. So I tried to grab the eel and put it back with his slimy friends. Great plan except that holding a slippery eel is a lot like, well... holding a slippery eel. 

After many frantic attempts I finally got a good hold of the creature and quickly tried to put it back in the bucket.  But a fatal combination of my panic, clumsiness and complete lack of coordination (which I still suffer from to this day) I accidentally kick over the bucket. 

Eels EVERYWHERE. 

At this moment my dad hears the commotion and opens up the door to find me frozen in the middle of a quickly spreading carpet of eels, whilst still desperately clutching one individual. 

He quickly responds and frantically starts to catch the eels before they spread further. But, again, eels are mighty slippery and it didn't help that I added two panloads of water to the slimy mess that is now our kitchen floor. Right behind my dad is our neighbour who was a bit tipsy after the celebration beers. He immediately comes to my dads assistance but forgets to close the door behind him, allowing his feisty little Jack Russell terrier to come in. The dog snaps into full possessed kill mode, catching and shaking the eels at a demonic speed. Slime and fishguts splash up the kitchen walls. The neighbour starts yelling at the dog, I start wailing, my mum comes running in and starts screaming when she sees the mayhem that is her kitchen. In all this confusion my dad looses his balance on the slimy floor, slips over, crushes 3 eels and breaks a finger. 

I can't remember how it all ended because I was send off to my room and had to stay there for 2 weeks. 
I do remember the kitchen stinking like fishguts for months after, no matter how much my mum scrubbed it. And me hearing about it every time she did. 

The Eel Incident happened about 20 years ago. 5 years ago my parents sold their house and the new owners did some renovations to the kitchen. Behind one of the cupboards they discovered what they thought were the remains of a snake (which is pretty unlikely since my parents live in Holland). When my dad came over to inspect he found that it was in fact the mummified remains of a getaway eel. 

TL;DR: Me trying to help a bucketload of eels causes great pain and suffering for everyone involved. Except the dog. The dog had a fat time. 

EDIT: first gold! Thanks stranger! I'd give you a eel bouquet if I could. "
"TIFU by being an idiot


Happened literally 5 minutes ago. 

My sister and I were arguing about if she needed a LifeProof case (expensive) for an iPhone she's going to buy. I took out my Moto G2 and, saying ""iPhones are weak, look at this"", dropped it from waist-height facedown onto our hardwood floors. I pick it up, them turn it over to the screen. 

Cracks. Spreading out diagonally from the front-facing camera, then bouncing around the sides.

"TIFU by accidentally terrorising my town


So this happened when I was around 18 years old. I lived in a small town where nothing much happens and used to work in a fish and chip shop on the weekends (in the UK). I had a few hours to kill before starting before getting a call from my friend stating that she was upset and needed cheering up.

In my infinite wisdom I thought the perfect way to do this would be to dress up to make her laugh. So I learned this cool way of using a black t-shirt to tie around my face as a substitute for a ninja mask. I didn't have much else, so I threw on a black vest, jogging bottoms and a bath robe to complete the outfit. I also had a huge wooden katana (Tensa Zangetsu for those who know this). 

Outfit done! Time to go to her house. I walked there, we had a laugh and then it was time for me to work. On my way back I got some funny looks from the children, but they knew I was a ninja. 

I get changed for work and leave my house, only to find a police car slowly patrolling the area.  I get stopped and they ask me what house I lived at. I told them my real address and I receive a funny look. Then he asks if I had seen a man walking around with a balaclava and a blunt weapon originating from that house or ones nearby. 

Thinking on my feet I almost told them that my neighbours were crazy like that but ultimately just said, ""no?"" 
I looked quite innocent in my fish and chip uniform. 
Turns out there was a woman who lived nearby who thought I was some sort of lunatic and called the police.  
After work I walked home and heard all sorts of rumours of this masked maniac. 
""last I heard he was in the woods.""
""There's some crazy guy with an axe!""

I literally slipped right past them undetected. Seriously though, an axe? 

Thinking back on it now, it does look very suspicious to see a man in a bath robe walking around with a massive sword. 

For the remainder of the week I saw police cars all over town looking for me. Luckily it all died down in the end and I never dressed as a ninja again.

TL;DR: Friend was upset, I dressed as a ninja to cheer her up, accidentally terrorise town by making them think a masked lunatic was on the loose. Police patrolled the streets for a good week before giving up. "

"TIFU by getting half my high school suspended


This was 1997 at a prep private school.  Both 10th and 11th grade shared a very pregnant English teacher.  One assignment involved both grades which involved all of us reading the book ""The Scarlet Letter.""  

Each class had a different assignment and, as a perk, it was arranged so both classes got to watch the movie together in one big room, split into a Thursday and Friday class period.  The English teacher would be supervising on Thursday, but had a last-minute appointment to meet with her OBGYN (preggo doc) on Friday.  She couldn't arrange for a sub for Friday, so she told us the Biology teacher would be checking in on us from time to time.

On Thursday, we started watching the movie.  We were expecting the one with Demi Moore.  Nope!  It was some older version.  So at the next free period, I floated the idea to a couple of friends about switching the movie on Friday to anything I could find at the public library on my bike ride home.  I don't think they thought I was serious, but I stopped at the library anyway.  The only thing I could find was ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights.""  It'll do.  I presented my loot to my friends the next morning at PE and it became our collective mission to convince the entire two classes to allow us to do it.  We did a good job too as we convinced nearly all of the class, INCLUDING the son of the owner of the school (he was easy), but still had to work on 3 goodie-goodie girls.  They were tough, but all of the class (peer pressure) wore them down. 

The biology teacher got the movie started right where it left off (VHS).  She gave us the evil eye to be good and left us alone so she could go teach her class.  We were now alone and all eyes were on me.  It was such a thrill to make the switch.  I will say this.. that movie is funny.  But when you are NOT supposed to be watching it.. it's HYSTERICAL.  We were having a good time and the biology teacher even walked back in to check on us.  Luckily, it was one of those serious medieval scenes.  She scanned the class and walked back out.  Close call since that movie is full of jokes.

The class period was all but over when the biology teacher returned, precisely at a joke scene (I think the ""lend me your ears"" scene).  She lightly scolded us, but switched the movie back.  The class ended moments later.  We laughed it off and enjoyed the rest of the day and weekend.

Monday came around and we all but forgot about the movie switch.  The headmaster was waiting for us in the class.  That was not unusual as he often invited us to do trash pickup or something.  Not this time.  He went into a long speech on how he was disappointed with all of us... but just when it was over, he surprised us all by saying that since no one ratted us out, that ALL of the 10th and 11th grades would be suspended for a single day.  ""All tests, quizes and assignments due for Tuesday, will now all have 0's"".  The goodie-goodie girls were in tears.  It didn't really matter, because all tests, quizes and assignments were postponed since no one was at school that Tuesday.  A letter was sent home with every student.  The letter never singled me out.. it just said ""a student"" had brought the video.  Another letter was put in our ""permanent record.""  

When my mom read this letter, she laughed, rolled her eyes and tossed it aside.  I laughed with her.  She then asked who brought the video, and I laughingly said it was me, like she would give me a high five or something.  Wrong.  She went from laughing to full-on anger in a heartbeat.  

I later heard it called ""The suspension of '97"".  When I was at college, I bumped into one of those goodie-goodie girls at a bus stop.  We sat and chatted for a bit and I brought up the suspension.  She stopped talking, gave me a neutral face, stood up and walked away.  Yikes.  

**

TL;DR: Switched out video during class and since no one ratted us out, the 10th and 11th grades all got suspended for one day.

**

UPDATE
Didn't expect this to gather so much attention.  I made some edits and grammar fixes after re-reading.  I saw a few comments saying this story is BS.  I don't blame you.. I also wouldn't believe it had I read it.  It did happen and, at the time, I can say I did feel pretty rotten about convincing those goodie-goodies who really didn't want any part of it.  They did laugh with the movie, so... Also, the teachers all kind of gave the impression that it was an excessive punishment and, I think for that reason is why they postponed the tests/quizes/assignments.  I left to dual-enroll at a community college the next year and didn't even know anyone thought fondly of it until I heard someone mention (years later) that the class (then seniors) called it the ""Suspension of '97"".  I felt like a proud father at that moment and bragged ever since.  Also, sorry for it being 20 years later.  Reddit wasn't around at that time and, after seeing many throwbacks, thought it would be fun to throw this one in.  I'm now married and a new dad and felt that sharing this story would give me warm feels.  It did.  Thanks Reddit for that.  :)"
"TIFU by being a keen student.


(Using a throwaway because I have friends who know my Reddit username but don't know this story.)

This TIFU happened when I was 15, when I was a sophomore in high school.

We were just getting into that intense time of year when exams are coming up, and report cards stop feeling like a dim and distant nightmare and start feeling like a real and waking nightmare. I was one of those dicks that sat at the front of every class and used up a small forest's worth of notepaper every semester. I sure as hell didn't get any girls, but I liked getting As.

Anyway, at some point deep into the semester, I got a bit of a cough. Got the whole deal with the swollen lymph nodes and the streaming eyes and nose, but was I going to miss any classes? Not a fucking chance. So a few weeks later, when I noticed I still had a bit of a lump under my jaw, I didn't really pay any attention to it. The lump got a bit bigger, but I figured it was one of those things that had to get worse before it got better, so I ignored it. It was only when it started to get kinda painful and actually big enough to be visible that I started to wonder if I should maybe, possibly think about seeing a doctor.

Did I see a doctor? No. I did not. I had algebra that wasn't going to solve itself.

I forced myself through weeks of school, until vacation finally rolled around, and it was a bit more convenient to go for a doctor's appointment. And, because I'm posting this in r/tifu, you've probably already guessed that they didn't just send me home with some Tylenol and an ""I've been brave"" sticker.

Turned out I had lymphoma, and in the time I'd been sitting in classes, it had worked its way right up to stage IV, and I had cancer cells settling into their cozy new homes in lymph nodes all over my body and in my liver. Lucky for me, it was a very curable form, and after the better part of a year of chemo, radiotherapy and emotional breakdowns, I was good to go. But sometimes I wonder if the treatment would have been easier if I'd gone to a doctor sooner, or what would've happened to me if I'd left it that bit longer or happened to have a more aggressive form of cancer.

So I decided to share this story. Because I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through if they can help it; and even though I was lucky, catching this kind of thing early can be the difference between living and dying. If you're reading this: sure, push yourself hard and achieve the things you want to achieve, but please don't push yourself so hard that you break.

tl;dr: Ignored a lump because I didn't want to miss classes, turned out it was lymphoma and it got to stage IV before I bothered to go see a doctor."
"TIFU by turning my ceiling lamp into a flashbang grenade


I live in a house that seems like the builders were on drugs while working. It required a lot of tinkering in the last couple of years (correcting the orientation of light switches that are placed sideways, rewiring lamps so that they actually illuminate meaningful spots, replacing door frames etc.), so I developed the habit of just watching a couple of youtube videos and fixing stuff myself.

So when one of the bulbs exploded on the stairway, I just went ahead and turned the electricity off from the main circuit switch of that section of the house. I grabbed [this shade](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ee/83/1d/ee831d9869c4957ec1a4e6804afd0bf9.jpg) with one hand and tilted it up so that I was directly looking into the remaining socket of the exploded bulb. Then, I proceeded to removing it with a plier.

Turns out I turned off the wrong circuit switch, because the stairway happens to be included in an irrelevant section. The moment the tip of the pliers touched the inside of the socket, it went off with a massive bang along with a blinding light. I was basically holding it 30cm to my face.

The stairs were already dark, so the flash completely obscured my vision. When I gathered my senses, I was falling sideways, because my body was trying to escape, while my feet were obstruced by the stairs and I couldn't execute the necessary string of movements required to climb a single step of a stair.

So, as a result of an attempt to be the man of a house that is not meant to have a man:

The pliers are gone. Luckily the handle was plastic.  
I have a persistent blotch in my field of view in the shape of the electrical spark. It's gradually getting better though.  
I bruised myself by falling during the initial disorientation.  
The main fuse of the house is burnt. Had to pay absurd amounts of money to have a replacement during this snow storm.  
When the fuse was fixed, it turns out the portion of the circuitry that included the lamp was burnt as well, so the lamp still doesn't work and the house is slightly less functional than it used to be before my repair.

------
edit: Thank you for all the suggestions. I usually read it twice before posting, this time I just wrote and submitted and I see that it caused some ambiguity. I had no way of ensuring that the light was off by turning off the switch, because it is controlled by two independent switches; one at the beginning and the other at the end of the stairs. So they don't have predetermined on/off positions. Also usually I'm way more cautious with this stuff, because, well I like being alive, but the major brain fart was not knowing better and assuming the light fixture was connected to an MCB that controlled everything else in its vicinity. Things usually are grouped by proximity, but it was idiotic to assume, hence the fuck up.

edit2: I can't give much in terms of visual evidence, because the electricians asked if I'd like them to throw the broken stuff to the dump on their way, so I said sure why not. But [this](http://i.imgur.com/s3SbmOO.jpg) was left. Doesn't show any physical damage from outside but yeah, there's that.

edit3: I don't own the place, I'm a renter. The only redeeming part is that the building is sold while I was still living in here. The new owner was at first extremely amiable, but then his parents-in-law saw the place and he instantly turned all ""get out in two weeks or things will get ugly"". He sued me on unfounded accusations to kick me out and stuff. So I'm silently welcoming all the shitty malfunctions the house is conjuring and I'm more than happy to just tolerate and leave the building as is. Dealing with insurance will be his own karma.
-------

TL;DR I tried to replace a burnt out bulb. The lamp turned into a makeshift stun grenade that went off to my face. Burnt several portions of the circuitry of the house. The lamp still doesn't work."

"TIFU by sitting on a sauna stove/heater


This wasn't today, it was probably 3 years ago.

I was living in North Sweden at the time with family (Originally Australian).  Saunas are extremely popular there and they are everywhere.  Most of the apartment blocks in town had like a communal hall that you could hire for parties/gatherings/bbqs etc. All of these halls had a sauna.

We had a party with a lot of my cousins and their friends one night.  We were blind drunk and thought it was time for a nice sauna.  My cousin turned on the sauna and about 10 minutes later I was the first one in and the sauna room was just room temperature.  So I walked out of the room and told him that he hadn't turned it on.  He insisted that it was on and looked at the digital gauge and confirmed it was at full heat.  Being the typical drunk Aussie I was determined to prove him he was wrong.  I picked up the rock out of the stove (It was warm) and help it up and said ""Look! See!""  He once again insisted that it was at full heat.  I then took it one step further to prove him wrong. I took off my towel and sat on the sauna heater to prove once more that he was a stupid Swed and I was the alpha male.  Well.  Turns out the elements inside the heater that actually heats up the room and rocks were at full heat (Like he said) and I completely incinerated my ass. 3rd degree burns for days.

I then ran out to the snow and sat in the snow drinking beer for a solid hour and then just numbed myself with more beer until the early hours. 

I didn't go to hospital, just bought a fuck load of antiseptic power and burn-bandages. Took a solid 5 weeks to heal. 

The hardest part was I had booked a flight home to Australia to surprise my family for x-mas a day after the accident. The trip is 35 Hours door to door. I had to sit and squirm in my plane seat like i had just been violently gang raped for the entire trip home and pack about 8 pairs under wear on my carry on luggage because the wounds were weeping so badly and the bandages did very little to stop it.

TL;DR - Arrogant Aussie gets swift dose of karma, burns own ass badly, flight home was nothing short of torture choreographed by Satan himself

"TIFU by explaining to my little brother what fetish means


Mandatory this was not today

So I was helping my little brother with reading, what I do is let him point out words in a dictionary and then I read them to him. So he points out the word fetish... so I said ""let's skip that one"" but he insists that I tell him the word so I say fetish and then he has me tell him what it means so I just say ""it means something you like, like ice cream"" so he is happy and moves on to new word. And all is normal. At least until Monday...

Now it is Monday, the first day of school and we get a call for the principle asking us to come and pick up little Johnny  because he is being sent home for sexually harassing the teachers and other students. My mom freaks out and starts yelling at the principal over the phone ""HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT A FETISH IS"". So apparently when he was introducing himself to the class is line was ""my name is Johnny fakename and I have and toy car fetish and a ice cream fetish"" and then whenever he would ask anyone a question the first one would usually be ""what is your fetish""


TL;DR
Turned my innocent little brother into a sexual predator with a ice cream fetish

"TIFU by Wearing a Bra


As an active duty service member, there is nothing better than being able to go home for Christmas. I had a set back getting home but after a nice long break from duty, I thought I was rejuvenated and ready for anything. I thought wrong.

The closest airport to where I live is so small it only has one runway. It had been raining there and there was a delay to my flight to Philadelphia, as expected, but it apparently got so bad that an earlier flight to the same place got cancelled. Note: I've never had an issue with American Airlines before, even though I've heard some horror stories. I thought my handy-dandy little CAC card or wearing the uniform could get me through anything.

So American Airlines, wanting to please the public, started boarding the people from the cancelled flight onto mine. I thought nothing of it because I bought this ticket two months ago, why would anything happen to me? To assume is to make an ass out of you and me and oh boy did I make an ass of myself. The flight ended up getting overbooked and I got kicked off the plane. Even after explaining my position as an active duty service member that needed to report to base the next morning, the plane left without me and about 5 other people.

Luckily, they said American Airlines would compensate me for the flight-about $300-and they would pay for my about 2 hour taxi ride to another airport, saying I would get a straight flight out to San Diego. The ride was fine, I got a nap in but all hell broke loose at the airport.

I was told I could skip past security but different airport means different security. I went through, took off all my metal and walked through the body scanner. A male and a female guard were standing duty there and the male patted me down, which I thought was weird but I let it slide. He looked at the screen, looked at me, patted me down and told me to step into the scanner again. I didn't think anything of it and did it but once I stepped out and he looked at the screen, he whipped out his walkie talkie and said ""I think we have a situation here"". 

The female guard was suddenly in interrogation mode and me, a 19 year old female, suddenly felt very alone, afraid, and like I was 5 years old. She asked for my ID and I provided my CAC card, and in the calmest voice I could possibly muster, I said I was enlisted and have to get on this flight. If you're enlisted too, you know CAC card pictures from boot camp are never flattering and don't look a lot like you after a while. Because of this, she became suspicious and asked for my name and birthday, which I provided but then she asked for my DOD ID number. If you're enlisted, you probably will read this and realize you probably don't know yours either. I told her I don't know it by heart and that most service members I know don't know theirs either but because of this she felt the need to say ""So you mean to tell me you don't know the identification number on your own ID?""

Within minutes, five other guards arrived, all armed, and told me to put my hands above me head and it was at this moment that I realized I fucked up, somehow, someway, I didn't know how. I did as I was told but demanded that I be able to make a phone call, as is my right. They allowed it and I had to call my dad, who works in the NYPD, to come bail me out and assert my identity. When he finally showed up, he did exactly what I knew he would and said:

""What are you doing to my daughter?""

The wire of my bra set off the metal detector but TSA thought I had a bomb strapped to my chest because they thought I was a man.

Finally the TSA nightmare was over but when I got to the gate, I tried to board but the ticket I was provided had a seat with someone already in it. The woman boarding me asked how old I was, and then asked for my ID, where I was mistaken for a man again, and was eventually given a seat.

The seat didn't exist.

I ended up sitting in a random empty seat.

"TIFU by undeliberately invading Russia.


(title FU too, should say accidentally, not undeliberately)

Throwaway due to obvious reasons. I cannot release too many details or get myself chewed out. A friend told me I had to post this to Reddit, so here it goes. This happened about two weeks ago before Christmas. 

I am a low ranked soldier in a ski patrol section. My section is responsible for guarding the border with Russia and looking out for people who seek to cross the border illegally. The task is very repetitive and cold, usually doing geared up patrols about 15-20km in total before returning to our designated station. We use very old cross country skis that have ancient bindings used with boot mounts. We use standard issue winter boots with mounts on the soles for the ski bindings. These of course are terrible, even for the snow. The bindings would come off easily if not paying attention to where they get hooked or apply too much pressure to either side of the bindings.

The border has a distinctive path where trees are chopped down in line to separate our countries apart. The Russian border patrol are very intolerant of people crossing into their territory, even our company of ski patrols. We must ask permission at a joint post not so far away from our station to cross into Russian territory for specified reasons, in person. We aren’t allowed to just radio our intentions in a full-on red tape scheme. If for any reason foreign army personnel enters their territory without permission, there will be trouble.

Cue the fuckup.

Our ski patrol has been going to our farthest distance before we eventually find a new ski patrol section. On the way back, about 6 of us are skiing down a long, but shallow slope with heavy gear close to a steep slope leading directly into Russia. We are going downhill where powder snow covers up chunks of ice and rocks that could easily bump you out and fall over if not balancing all the added weight from the gear. As we are about 12km away from our station, going to return for guard change, I mess up and everything is going downhill (really).

I lost my ski as I hit a boulder of sorts that knocked off one of my skis off, driving straight down the steep slope on my side. Everybody stopped and as I got up I saw the trail of my ski going into the tree line in Russia. We had to discuss what to do and came to a few options. We could either:

* Make me use one ski through the remainder of the patrol, being incredibly stupid and inefficient to do.
* Wait in the cold for the other soldiers to go back to station and return with a snowmobile and requested permission, picking up my lost ski and arrive back at night time.
* Go get it, (corporal doesn’t really think Russians are that intolerant of a missing ski)

Proceed to the fuckup.

None of us are allowed to leave our rifles, even out of reach from our arms. (It can’t go missing as a superior many years ago lost his own while taking a leak in the forest, not ensuring his rifle was safe.) Now I am entering Russia going down a hill trying to look for the ski by its trail, carrying a rifle and walking straight into foreign territory. I am walking about 60 meters into the territory with its continuous slope, still haven’t found a ski yet. There is a road on the other side where Russian trucks are heard by their loud truck engines. 
I’m looking around to see if the ski had caught onto a tree when a car with a jeep look shows up and stops. A uniformed man steps out quickly keeping his hand on his holster. We do not have remotely the same ones. He looks angry, comes towards me and starts spewing out a river of Russian words that (guess what?) I can’t understand. I try my best imitation of skiing and telling a broken story of losing my ski. Things get worse when I stressfully turn around trying to get a glimpse of the missing ski instead of looking at him as he speaks. He grabs my shoulder to get my attention and signals me to get into his car heading closer towards my base. Without my radio, I yell to my section that they just have to continue going back without me or my ski. He asks me to hand over my weapons and shows me to the back seat of the jeep and have an awkward 30-minute ride to a Shed with other Russian guards. The angry guy talks to one of them in an office and takes a call to our station that is nearly adjacent (approx. 1km away) to the shed. I’m waiting outside for any positive news. An older guy comes out looking half disappointed, half angry. He gives me the flat hand gesture of “wait here”, so I do. A few minutes later, my sergeant shows up to get me from a snow mobile. He is not in a happy mood. He takes me back to the motherland where I get hounded in laughs from an off duty guard team. My patrol shows up later and have questions and a general roast of how I “won” a moment today.

TL;DR I’m a soldier who lost ski into Russian territory, went to get it back and got caught by Russian army.
