"Ladies of Reddit, how did you know that your SO was it for you?


I'm sure that this has been asked before, but this kind of thread never gets old. I feel like men get asked this question all the time, and we ladies never get to share our moment. Plus, the world needs the kind of positivity that comes from these discussions. 

Edit: After reading all of these comments, I want to share my story too. I met my guy when we were in elementary school, but we weren't really friends until our sophomore year of high school, when I developed a huge crush on him. I was a good buddy until our senior year, when he and I finally began dating. He clicked for me like no one else. I can literally tell him anything, including the gross stuff that no one wants to hear. My introverted self doesn't get worn out around him, he makes me want to be adventurous. He knows how to just love me when I'm feeling anxious or depressed. I don't have to doubt that he loves me, and I don't have to doubt that I want to be with him for the rest of forever. There isn't a specific moment where I knew, but I do know that he's it for me. "
