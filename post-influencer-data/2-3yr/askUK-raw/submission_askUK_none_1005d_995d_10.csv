"Does my landlord legally have to provide a toilet?


My landlord only charges me Â£50 (Leicester) a week for a 1 bed room with a bathroom. There is a bath tub, but no sink or toilet. He told me I should go the the nearby McDonalds to use the toilet. I just piss , brush and shit in the tub (and force it down with water, so its clean), as i'm too lazy to walk 2 mins. 

Am I legally entitles to request he build a toilet? I pay him in cash every week."
"Can anyone beat this as worst response to a present today?


Bought my missus of 10 years some clothing.
