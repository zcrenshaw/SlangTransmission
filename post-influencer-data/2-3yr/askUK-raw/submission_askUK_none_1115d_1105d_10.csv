"What company in the UK has lost your business forever and why?


Cos I never heard of any of those American companies in the askreddit thread earlier. I'm never shopping at Arcadia shops for obvious reasons.

Edit: I just remembered my dad hated Bay Trading Company all the way back from the nineties cos he wrote a cheque for some gear for me and the girl asked to see his debit card to prove out the cheque or something, I don't know. Anyway he was so livid and insulted that he wouldn't even set foot inside ever again and would noisily wait outside while I perused the scrunchies and tattoo necklaces. "
"Did anybody else struggle to adapt to life post uni?


I'm having a bit of a mare and I figured I'd ask the most well balanced subreddit I know. 

I went to uni, felt like I couldn't wait to get a job and so when I graduated I spent ages searching for one. Then, as Morrissey said 'I was looking for a job and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now.'

I got one, in the end, in some big corporate office, everything that should make somebody happy, except that all my passion for life has gone. I'm literally dead inside and feel like a drone. Wake up, work, eat, sleep and repeat. 

My passion has always been politics and now I'm working in it it makes me want to tear my eyes out. I can't stand the daily grind, the daily commute, the office politics, the people posturing over job titles to show off, the pointless battles peple make, the fact that this could be me for the next 40 years before I retire then die.

It's honestly making me feel a bit ill with worry. Every night I come home upset about it. 23 now, coming up 24, feeling like my time to nob around not knowing what I want to do is fading fast. 

Did anybody else have this sort of problem post uni? I can barely mmotivate myself to get out of bed most days and have seriously considered just living in my parent's spare room and reading all day. At least I'd be spending my life doing something I wanted to.

I've considered changing too, perhaps to law, perhaps to teaching, perhaps to something completely different from what I do now but I'm terrified that if I pick one and don't like that either, I've wasted my last shot.

Has anybody got any advice? I appreciate this sounds a bit of a ramble but what a bloody mess this has turned out to be, this whole get a job and live your life thing."
