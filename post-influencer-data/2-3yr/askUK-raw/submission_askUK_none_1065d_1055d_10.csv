"Anyone experience difficulty with tone with Americans?


(I also posted this to r/unitedkingdom just to cover my bases, apologies for the double post!)

This is a rather odd post, but I find myself being misunderstood in conversation incredibly often by my American coworkers. (I work in the US.)

It's not the accent or word meaning, but tone. I've been told I sound patronizing when I'm genuinely trying to be helpful, and passive-aggressive when asking a legitimate question. I'm obviously confused by this as I have no problem being understood back home.

Has anyone else experienced this in the US? I know there's culture differences, but I hate to feel I'm being thought of as this awful person."
