"My bag went missing from a nightclub cloakroom


I paid two pounds for them to look after my bag. I was given a ticket. At the end of the night I went to retrieve my bag, only to be told that I ""must've already taken it"", as it was no longer there. I still had the ticket, and had certainly not taken it. I asked to go into the cloakroom and look around, there were only a handful of items left and my bag was definitely not among them. Spoke to the manager who took all my details and said he would call the next day once he had reviewed the CCTV. He hasn't called, I foolishly didn't take his details as I had had a fair few beers. The bag contained probably close to Â£800 worth of stuff (I'd come from work so suit, clothes for next day, iPad, kindle, headphones etc.). I'm planning to write a letter to the club, copy in the owners, and take them to the small claims court if I don't get a satisfactory conclusion. Do I have a leg to stand on, has anyone experienced anything similar? 

Edit to add: I should have stated, I did report this to the police and do have a crime reference number."
