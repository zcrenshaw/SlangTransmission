"Why are my walls made of biscuit?


I bought a cheap throwup wardrobe a few months back it's started to lean, so I thought I'd screw the thing to the wall (as the instructions state I should). However, upon inserting screws in wall I discovered my walls are made of digestive biscuits. I can appreciate the interior wall being so, but this was an external facing wall that I thought might be made of bricks. Seemingly not.

It's a new build about 6 years old. It's a flat, and by all accounts it doesn't seem to be well constructed. Those are issues for another day.

So what are builders doing to new builds that requires biscuit to be used? Is it cheaper than brick? Do they have surplus from their tea breaks?"
