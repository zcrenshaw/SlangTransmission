"Randomly came home to pennies on my doorstep. Should I be concerned ?


On the left and right of the doorstep were a 1p with a 2p in the middle.

Never heard of this before, I live in a small village. I've never been so confused, a quick google search resulted in answers ranging from thieves, message from a spirit to something involving pets.

EDIT: [solved] Uncle has started a new job up the road from me and thought it would be a funny prank, tried to tell me it was a devil worshiping cult."
"VHS Footage Salvaged!


I posted a request a few weeks back for old VHS tapes as I run a YouTube channel which highlights the lesser known corners of British TV and I was very grateful to receive my first package of tapes yesterday. In particular, I've found a good 20 minutes worth of adverts/continuity from Channel 4 in 1993 https://youtube.com/watch?v=6fM-HzJuFXI

Thanks!"
