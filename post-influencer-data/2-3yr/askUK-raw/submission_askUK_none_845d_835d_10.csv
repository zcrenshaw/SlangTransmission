#Can you still vote in a polling station if you have registered for a postal vote?

If you have applied to vote by post, you [cannot vote in person at the polling station](https://www.yourvotematters.co.uk/faq/voting-by-post). However, on polling day you can return your postal vote to the polling station (before 10pm) or to the Returning Officer at your local council (before they close) if you do not want to post it or it is too late to post it.

#Will there be queues like last time?

Probably even longer

#Will they let me vote if I'm still queuing at 10pm?

If you're in the queue the instruction is to let you vote.

#What can't I do at a polling station?

#When do I find out the result?

Overnight, possibly tomorrow morning. An exit poll (indicating an estimated outcome) is released at 10pm by the BBC.

#How do I follow after it's finished?

[BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40173107) / Guardian / Sky

#Why are Jeremy Corbyn / Theresa May / [Party Leader] not on the ballot sheets?

We're not American, we have a constituency system where we elect constituency representatives to government. The party with the most representatives can form the government (or a coalition government in the event of not enough representatives to form a majority, known as a hung parliament).

#What is the voting system?

First Past The Post (FPTP) - the most votes wins.

Clarification: The most votes in each constituency wins that constituency. It's possible for one party to get more votes overall but not end up with the most MPs. - /u/Lionel_de_Lion

#Can I register today?

Lul. Nope.

###Please remember to be kind and offer a smile to those working in the polling stations. It's a long day for them.

"I was followed home tonight - what can I do?


I'm a woman in my mid 20s. Walking home from the bus stop tonight, I sensed two teenage boys start to follow and shout things at me (they were on the other side of the road and crossed over). I had headphones on and couldn't hear a lot of what they said but it was obvious they were trying to get my attention. I heard a lot of ""hey darling/babe"". I ignored them and started walking faster. Then one of them got in front of me. I said fuck off. They continued to follow me - still shouting things like ""I wanna make a baby with you"" -
right to my front door. They were laughing and asking if they could come in. I quickly shut the door and burst into tears.

I really didn't know what to do and I'm terrified they'll come back to harass me since they know where I live. If I called 101 what would happen? I want to inform the police but I'm not sure what they could realistically do and I didn't get a very good look at the lads anyway (just that they were about 14/15 wearing sports clothes). 

Any advice appreciated."
"I know it's unlikely but does anyone know if the girl who asked for help as she was being stabbed in London survived?


I haven't been able to stop thinking about her since I heard of the event. I realise she probably died but I feel like I need to know as I can't stop thinking about her.
