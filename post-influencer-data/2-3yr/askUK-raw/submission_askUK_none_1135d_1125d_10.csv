"Does anyone else miss Teletext holidays and Bamboozle?


I loved the feeling when you got 10 out of 10 right on Bamboozle the first time without having to redo the quiz"
"Advice needed; NHS refusing operation because I have no friends or family


I've been diagnosed with testicular cancer and I'm due to have an operation to remove both testicles. However the hospital is now saying that I must have someone stay with me in my house for 24 hours after the operation due to possible side effects of the anesthesia. But I have no friends or family, no co-workers, no acquaintances, literally no one. There is no one in the world I can ask to say with me for 24 hours. I'm happy to sign a waver absolving the hospital of any responsibility, or I'm happy to stay in the hospital for 24 hours so that they can monitor me themselves. But neither option is acceptable to them. What am I supposed to do, pay a prostitute to say with me? They require the persons name and address so I very much doubt ""Jasmin"" from ""Deluxe Massage"" will be acceptable for this purpose. This situation is ridiculous, I'm being denied life-saving treatment because I'm a loner. Any ideas on what I can do? I've already been to the PALs service and quoted the Equality Act 2010 at them, but being a loner isn't a protected disability so they won't make an adjustment. I'm sure I'm autistic or something and could get a diagnosis and then force them to comply with the Equality Act, but waiting months or even years for a formal diagnosis from the overloaded and underfunded mental health services is not an option when I need this operation right now."
