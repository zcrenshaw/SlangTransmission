"What happens if I tell my GP I'm feeling a little bit suicidal?


Like, fed up with life and wouldn't mind if I died peacefully in my sleep tonight, but not actively planning anything right now. I've felt this way since 2005. Sometimes I research ways to do it but only in a ""this could be my way out if things get worse"" kind of way.

This is probably an overreaction but I'm scared of mentioning it to a doctor in case I'm sectioned on the spot, carted off to Springfield Mental Hospital, given electric-shock ""therapy"" and force-fed a cocktail of mind altering drugs until I say I'm not suicidal anymore, even if its a lie.

Realistically, what is my GP likely to do if I admit this to her? Can I decline any treatment that she offers, or will I be forced to comply with her treatment plan once I've told her? That's my biggest fear, not being able to back out of it once the ball has been set in motion, having social services banging at my doctor and the police forcing their way in to get me, that sort of thing.

Maybe that sounds far fetched to you, but I've already had the police force entry into my house ""for my safety"" after I reported a stolen bicycle via the 101 number. I had no idea they would come around to take a statement in person, so when people started banging aggressively at the door, not knowing it was the police I ignored them hoping they would go away. They did not go away, they claimed they were worried I had hung myself. They wouldn't pay for the repair to the door either, but kindly offered to nail a piece of chipboard over the hole for Â£190.

The point being I can't tell anymore if I'm just being paranoid because I've already experienced this sort of escalation from service personal over something completely minor and irrelevant that quickly blew up out of all proportion. I don't want it to happen again."
