"ELI5: Why do teachers hate Michael Gove?


Most, if not all, of my teachers disliked/hated Gove, so I feel compelled to hate him too, but what has he done? I don't know much about him.


Thanks for all your responses! Makes sense now."
"Neighbour is putting out rat poison for cats.


it appears one of my neighbours is placing rat poison around his garden in an attempt to stop cats from crapping on his lawn.

I'm pretty sure this isn't something thats allowed, but I'm unsure who I should approach to get something done.

EDIT: I will contact the RSPCA, hopefully they can talk some sense into him.

UPDATE: Have spoken with them, along with several others and local authorities have been informed. Hopefully this is the end of it."
