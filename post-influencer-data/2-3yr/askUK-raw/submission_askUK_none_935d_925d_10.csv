How do you deal with little shits like that?"

**Sorry for making another post, but I'm rather desperate. Since making the post we have exchanged some texts as follows:**



*""Hi (insert my name), I've received the estimate from BMW and the repairs come up to **Â£1944.50**. I spoke to BMW just now and queried the extras and they said it was necessary work and built into the total price. Obviously I need to get the car sorted ASAP, will you please call the Garage to organize prepayment and let me know when you have done it"".*

**I reply**

"" Hi, thanks for getting in touch. I cannot afford the lump sum of the amount quoted. I would like to pay the money in installments to your insurance company if you decide to go through that route. The police on the phone suggested that since I am an uninsured cyclist that I may be covered by household contents cover, would it be possible to explore this option?""

**Her response:**

*""Hi (insert my name), I understand your situation and sympathize but ultimately you caused the damage and you are legally required to pay for the costs of repair. How you find this money is not of my concern and it needs to be sorted right away. Unfortunately for you, both myself and my fiance are solicitors and you can look us up online (his name is ____) and we will take all the necessary action without delay"".*

Where do I go from here? I am definitely not trying to shirk the responsibility of paying the damage I caused but she seems to expect that I can pay the full amount in one go, which I definitely cannot due to my status as a student and a lack of stable income. I looked up the name she gave me and the results show that they are both seasoned solicitors. I have tried to read and take in all the information you have gave me in the last post, but I'm still worried at what is going to happen and what I should do. From the text messages you can see I have not been unreasonable and have tried to offer a middle ground that is reasonable relative to my situation. Do I let her take legal action and what would that entail? Is this technically taking me to a small claims court? "
