"Someone keeps reporting me as being a burglar breaking into my own home


The first time it happened I assumed it was an honest mistake. Second time I wasn't in and the police went to all the neighbors asking if they knew me (they didn't because I keep to myself) and when I came home in the evening they were in my garden and said they were just about to ""force entry"" because they had knocked 4 times during the day but got no answer. Well, fuck me but some of us have to go to work and can't be in all day long to answer bogus calls. Just had them at the door again today. Each time they come they make me show them that my keys open the front door, and then they say sorry and leave. This time they even told me they basically knew it was a wind up because the file had the previous times listed, but they still had to come out and check anyway. What the fuck can I do about this? I have no idea who is making these reports, the police said they couldn't tell me, not sure if that was because of data protection or they just didn't know. So basically I can't be away from home for more than 12 hours now because some prick will make a bogus report and the police will break down my door if they don't get an answer from me. They told me if they did this I would have to pay for the repair because they would have acted on a credible report so are not at fault. What if I stay over with a friend or want to go on holiday?

There's got to be at least a couple of these every week.

Edit: missed out an 'a' in the title, ah well."
