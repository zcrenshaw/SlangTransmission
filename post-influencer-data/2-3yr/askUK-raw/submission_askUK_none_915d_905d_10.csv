"People who remain standing at the bar when the pub is busy; why?


I shouldn't have to stand behind people and shout my order though a gap and then snake my hand through to get my pint when there are 30 people in the pub and 17 of them are stood casually drinking at the bar. 

Don't get me wrong, i'm all for bar dwelling when it's quiet but when there is actually no serving room left, please vacate the area. "
"Does anyone else find that Burger Kings are a lot dirtier inside than McDonald's?


I've noticed that in Swansea at least the Burger Kings have overflowing bins, dirty tables and counters and rubbish left all over the place. It annoys me because I actually prefer BK's food to McDonald's but I'm put off going there because they they don't seem to be that interested in keeping the place clean."
