"If you win the postcode lottery do you have to be in the advert?


If so then I don't think it's worth it"
"If you were given the choice to live in the USA or UK, which would you chose and why?


As a teenage Uk reddit user, most of the userbase is very american, and I have learn't alot about america in the last few weeks that make me feel very grateful for living in the UK.

Free universal healthcare, no crazy costs that put me in high debts

Less gun users, and overall a better police force and policy, I feel very safe in the UK when I compare it to the USA

Better laws, no crazy laws about alimony or child support (I've read multiple stories about people having to pay 50% of thier wages in child support and 25% in alimony, leaving them broke), however in the UK, If I was earning Â£1000 a week, paying for 2 kids I never wanted to see, it would only be 15% a week.

Not having to deal with comcast, tipping, or having to add tax to stuff you buy.

Maybe this is just a rant about stuff I dislike about america, but what advantages do you think the USA has over the UK?

If you were given the choice to live in the USA or UK, which would you chose and why?

"What's your favourite British beer?


Let's forget the Stellas and the Hoegaaaaardens and the Oranjebooms and the 90p Aldi German beers, what British beer makes your mouth water at the mere thought of it?

For me:

* Brewdog Punk IPA
* Sharp's Doombar
* Old Speckled Hen

Obvious choices I realise but having lived out of the country for a number of years, I'm feeling nostalgic for those fellas.

Edit. Moving back to pommyland in February so am looking forward to not paying 5 quid for just over half a pint and I shall be lining up a few of your suggestions on my return. Cheers!"
