"What is your real opinion of William Shakespeare?


Just wondering what real people think of him rather than just the literature elite (if you know what I mean)"
"My driving instructor rarely responds to my texts, tries to convert me to Islam, asks inappropriate questions about my relationship. I've already paid cash in advance and it's an independent instructor. How do I get rid??


So I've paid this instructor £500 in advance for a 20 hour intensive course, but due to their lacking in organisational and communication skills, I currently only get one 2 hour lesson a week.

I've had 7 hours of lessons so far and my test is in less than a month. This week I texted four times and got no reply, yet saw that they were constantly on whatsapp so I got them on there and asked to book some hours. I was met with ""I'll text you dates tonight"" and didn't hear back.

This morning I whatsapped over a list of times and dates and asked to just book in advance as I'm tired of never knowing if I have a lesson that week, and then being hit with ""I'm on the way"" with no time to get ready. That or they're 10-15 minutes late.


I was fobbed off with ""are you free tomorrow? We can arrange dates then"". I haven't replied yet.


Other issues are when they realised I am an atheist, they spent the next 1.5hours of the lesson trying to convince me that Islam was what I needed to save me. I'm not anti-religion, but I didn't sign up for this.


I also get hit with questions like ""wouldn't you rather have a child with someone who didn't already have children?"" in a conversation about my relationship with my partner and his two kids. They also once referred to my partner's ex-wife as his ""other wife"" which made me uncomfortable.


I want to ditch this instructor and just hope to find another one in the time I've got before my test. The actual driving lessons aren't so bad but they're always texting and not really concentrating on what I'm doing - luckily I'm partially experienced so it's not like I need them focused on me the whole time, but for example, every time I approach a roundabout I have to ask ""which way do you want me to go?"" Becaus their attention is always on their phone.



The kicker is, I've paid £500 in cash and wasn't given a receipt and was too dumb to ask for one. I want the remainder of my money back and I want a new instructor. There's no information on their website about refunds.


What do??"
