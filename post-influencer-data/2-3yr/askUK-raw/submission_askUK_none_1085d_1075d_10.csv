"Should the Wallace and Gromit theme replace the national anthem?


I think it sounds very patriotic and would sound even better with a piece of Wensleydale!

"American throwing a British-themed party


Hi all,
A good friend of mine grew up in London. He loves Arsenal, saying things like ""banter"" and ""scenes"", and good Indian food.

We want to throw him a birthday party with the cheesiest British-themed decor, music, food, and activities. Any suggestions?

Thanks!

EDIT: After believing the first comment, I now understand the famous Brit humor! #scenes?"
