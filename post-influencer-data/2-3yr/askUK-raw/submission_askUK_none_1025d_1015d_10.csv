"Why is it headline news that a pop singer's mum has died?


That's going to sound crass but it isn't intended that way, I'm genuinely curious why the death of Louis Tomlinson's mother is so prominent.  Was she famous in her own right or in the public eye in some way?"
"What celebrities have you met? Who were the nicest and who were dicks?


I met Alex Brooker (The Last Leg) recently in a club. He was really nice, talked to me for about 25 minutes. Had some banter about football (I made fun of Arsenal's fans, he made fun of how shit Everton are at the moment), talked about when he went to uni up here in Liverpool, wished me happy birthday and stuff. But when I brought up how my girlfriend is Australian and loves Adam Hills, he went on for a good couple of minutes about how much of ""an absolute fucking dick"" he is to anyone who isn't a celebrity, he's an arrogant arsehole etc, which was pretty sad. He'd been really nice to me so I have no reason to believe it's him who is the dick rather than Adam.

He did say Josh Widdecombe was the nicest guy you could ever meet and is seriously funny to talk to though, which was cool."
