"What are your opinions on the 'Polite' hi vis's horse riders wear?


I live near the woods and see people wearing these most days. 

[This is the style I'm on about ](https://i.imgur.com/D9AA2Su.jpg) 

It's obvious they are trying to appear like police at first appearance to slow drivers down. After reading reviews about them, that's exactly what the people buying them are trying to achieve. 

Is this borderline impersonating a police officer? 

What would happen if I had a big decal down the side of my car saying 'Polite' in the same style with the blue and white checkering? "
"Is it normal to unplug your kettle?


So we've got an electric kettle, that just lifts off the base, like most people. But every-time I come to put a brew on, SO has unplugged the damn thing from the wall.

Is this normal?

Is more annoying than having no milk."
