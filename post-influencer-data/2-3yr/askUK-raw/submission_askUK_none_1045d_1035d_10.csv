"Why on earth is everything in this country London-centric?


I'm admittedly a bit bitter, I graduated and got a job, but then lost my job to redundancy.

I'm back searching and everything worthwhile seems to be in London, I get that it's a huge capital city, but I don't understand why companies that don't even need to be set up in London are all there.

It makes no sense why places cram their offices into a city that's already bursting at the seams and have their staff live miserable lives in a high rent, high cost place.

I would head to London but I hear nothing but absolutely abysmal and depressing stories that even teachers and solicitors (middle ranking), some bankers can't even afford houses there and the quality of life is awful.

Why do they not move to another city where it's cheaper?

Sorry, rant over, but it does frustrate me that there are perfectly good cities elsewhere yet if it's not London they're not interested."
"I logged into an old recruitment site account to get a copy of my CV and one of the recruiters called my current employer and told him I was active on the site (I'm not, I just needed a phone number). My boss called me in to his office to ask if I was thinking of leaving (I'm not). Is this allowed?
