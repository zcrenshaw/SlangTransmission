"Is my girlfriend now banned from the US? Dual UK/Iran citizen


As the title really, my girlfriend holds UK and Iranian passports and was born in the UK. Is she now banned from the US as a citizen of one of the 7 nations in Trump's executive order?

I'm asking because people are saying Sir Mo Farah and Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi are now banned from the US as a result of this order. But they were born abroad.

I've read [the full text of Trump's executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) and I can't figure it out, it's incredibly vague."
"Has anybody here been to the GP for depression? Thank you for helping me out yesterday.


Was feeling like just jumping under a train yesterday, really wasn't in the best state. Spoke to Samaritans for an hour, the person was lovely, had been in my situation but now has a nice job and volunteers to help others out. We discussed my possible depression as well. 

I am not sure about going to the GP for depression. I was told they can prescribe items which can help me out. Is everything I say to my GP confidential? Would potential employers legally have to know or be told about my issues? 

Anybody taken anything for depression (from the GP) ? What was it like and did it work? "
"British Jews, what's your experience with anti-semitism in Britain?


I've often felt the UK's a generally tolerant country of Jews, and it certainly seems less prevalent than hostility towards Muslims or immigrants.

But since I'm not Jewish, I'm likely to under-estimate just how common it is.

So, yeah, thoughts?"
