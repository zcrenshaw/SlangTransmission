"I'm 17, extremely fat, no job, no qualifications and no motivation - What to do?


Hello there,

I'm worried and scared about what the future holds for me, I want to accomplish something with my life but I feel like I've dug myself into a deep hole that I will never get out of and I'm terrified. 

I didn't try in secondary school, I had no motivation, no reason to try and thus I ended up with E level results and I'm extremely disappointed in myself. I would like to do something with IT &amp; Computers one day but jobs like that need qualifications and good grades. Something I don't have.

I left Secondary School back around June 2015 and since then I've done nothing, absolutely nothing. I've just sat around at home in my room playing video games on my computer that I custom-built back in August 2014. I was fat in primary and turned obese during secondary, I'm most definitely even bigger now because of the time that I've spent sitting around doing nothing, I have absolutely zero self confidence, I am scared to meet people because I feel like I'll be judged, the whale in the room.. only literally.

I want to have a purpose with my life but I have no idea how to begin, Ideally I would like to go to University one day and do something related to IT but what hope is there for someone that weighs so much, has zero confidence and pretty much no qualifications?

I did go to a College one day while I was still in secondary to check it out, but there was so many stairs to climb I kept having to take breaks frequently, went out and never went back in because I felt so embarrassed and ashamed. It sounds pathetic but it really affected me. 

I'm so sorry for this wall of text but I really could do with some guidance right now. I really need it."
