"How much G force can wasps sustain?


Hi /r/AskUK!

Some of you may remember a debate about [whether the G forces sustained by a wasp whizzing around the inside of a Dyson would be enough to knock them out or kill them](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/530gr6/hey_guys_bit_of_an_emergency_situation_here_lots/d7oz7tz).

Good news - Dr Broad has replied!  Bad news - He says he doesn't know and recommends a more humane method of disposal of errant wasps.

Sorry it didn't work out /u/ionised - I hope you figured out a way of getting rid of them in the meantime :)"
"Hey guys, bit of an emergency situation, here. Lots of bees/wasps suddenly gained access to one entire half of my house. Help!


They're hanging around the light fixtures and are being incredibly aggressive. What can I do? "
