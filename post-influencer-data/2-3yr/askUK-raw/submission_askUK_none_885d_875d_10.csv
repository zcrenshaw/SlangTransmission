"Why does boxing get so popular for big fights


Literally no one I know likes boxing yet in the past day most of my friends are now huge boxing fans. 

This always seems to happen whenever there's a big fight. No interest in the sport at all then the whole nation goes fucking spastic for 24 hours. What is it about boxing? You don't really see it with any other sport. "
