"After the Queen dies, how long will it take everyone to get used to the fact that there's no queen anymore that rules but a king?


I mean if she had a female heir nothing would really change. But most people alive in the UK only remember a queen being there."
"Why are nurses in the UK paid so poorly?


In the USA nurses average close to $70,000 a year and can make over $100,000. They are considered very important and well compensated. 

I saw that nurses in the UK earn about half (or less) than American nurses.

Why are they paid so poorly for such an important job?
