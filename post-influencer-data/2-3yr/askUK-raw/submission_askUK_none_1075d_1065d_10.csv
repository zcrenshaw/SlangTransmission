"What happened to me at Greggs?


My nearest Greggs is 3 hours away, so I'm not familiar at all with their pricing. 

I happened to be in Edinburgh this weekend and nipped into Greggs to pick up a bottle of juice for my journey back home. On the way out the door (£1.20 lighter) I spotted a glorious ham and cheese baguette and decided it was worth a punt. I distinctly remember it's price being £2.50. When I got to the till the same guy who had just served me said ""that's part of the deal, it's only 50p extra,"" so I handed him 50p. 

So a bottle of juice and a baguette for £1.70? I asked my mate if that was right and he just said ""aye they do deals and that eh"".

I lost sleep last night thinking about how cheap that is. I had the other half of the baguette for breakfast. He bought 4 sausage rolls."
"Will Northern Rail ever replace their shitty 40+ year old trains?


After using northern rail for 5 or 6 years now I have to say they are the worst train company I've used. All their trains are complete pieces of junk, they smell of piss, the seats almost always have dodgy stains on them, and the trains themselves are always cold and shake constantly.

Northern also seem to go out of their way to make sure every train they run is always 1 carriage short. What's with that? For example, the trains between Sheffield and Doncaster during the evening when everyone is finishing work is always 2 carriages and each one must be at least twice the safe limit. Every bump in the track people go flying.

Urgh I am so sick of it, rant over. Anyone else feel the same way about them?

If you don't believe they are 40+ years old: https://www.ft.com/content/8ef8990e-3b68-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152"
