"I may have caught someone wanking in work. Need advice.


Throwaway for obvious reasons. I need advice. 

On friday I was going for my morning shit. I always use the disabled toilet because it's private and I like the space. The toilet door was unlocked, so I opened it and to my surprise there was a bloke sat there with his pants around his ankles and a laptop on his knees looking *very* shocked to see me. Being British I immediately apologised, shut the door and walked away laughing to myself. 

When I got back downstairs to my desk I told my two fellow trainees about the incident. I told them what I'd seen and thought the guy might have been masturbating. Either that or sending a *very* important e-mail. 

With it being a slow work day more people overheard our discussion and started to chime in and asked who it was. I said I didn't recognise the guy and (due to the way he was dressed) thought he worked in a different department. I thought that would be the end of it.

Ten minutes later my colleagues cousin came over from another department and asked him if he knew about the guy who was caught wanking in work. That shit spread like wildfire. No names, no nothing. Just a mysterious guy knuckling one out in the disabled toilet. 

Soon after my supervisor approached me, she asked if I want to give a statement as another supervisor (nothing to do with me) had heard about it and wanted the guy to be disciplined. I said no, because I don't want a guy to be sacked because I walked in on him in the bathroom. It just wouldn't sit right on my conscience. My supervisor said that's fine, nothing else would come of it.

She was wrong. Soon after I had to speak with our shift manager. I was taken upstairs to an office and he made me give a statement in which I was 100% honest. I told him that I walked in on a bloke who had his pants around his ankles, laptop on his knees looking shocked and a little sweaty. He said fine and that would be all. I left feeling slightly dejected as I wished not to give a statement in the first place.

After working for a while longer I was re-approached by the manager, we went back to the office and he asked for more detail. By now I was feeling pretty shitty. He asked me if I thought he was masturbating and I said ""well yeah, if you walk into a room where someone has their pants around their ankles, laptop on their knees looking sweaty and shocked to see you - what would you think?"" He nodded and amended a part of my statement. I also told him to add ""I was forced to make this statement by an entirely uninvolved third party who has heard of this event through chinese whispers"". He did. I signed. I left. 

Sound.

However today after dinner I was told to go back into the office while he was alongside a member of HR. They asked more questions about what I saw, what I said and what I did after seeing the situation. I told them everything. Again. Then she starts asking loaded questions and I get quite angry. I bottle it up to the best of my ability but I start asking questions myself. 

It turns out that someones name has been thrown into the mix and I'm spreading rumours about him. Real playground bullshit. I asked her why I'd make up rumours about a man I've never met, and wouldn't recognize if I tripped over him in the street. She was unfazed and then asked some bullshit about how I'd feel if I were in this individuals situation. I said ""I wouldn't be wanking in work for one"" which went down like a lead balloon. In hindsight, probably shouldn't have said that. Tomorrow I need to read and sign my second statement, but I intend to change it in light of what they want to do to me.

Anyway, here's the point where I need help: 

HR lady said that if no porn is found on that company laptop I will be given a warning or fired. I don't want either. I'm never late, I work hard, I keep myself to myself and I go home. 


I told an anecdote about a bloke who *may* have been masturbating to a couple of colleagues. The rumour mill spread that shit, the guys who watched the CCTV must've named the bloke and spread it around when I wasn't even in work, and I feel like I'm being made the fallguy because of it.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my job, but I'm not going to roll over and take a verbal or written because some lad can't lock a door. Tomorrow I get a chance to revise my statement. What should I do/say?

**tl;dr:** May have caught a guy wanking. Told a couple of people a funny story. Might get in in serious shit because of it. What do?

**Update: 14/6/16** 

Spoke to my suporvisor who gave me time offline so I can read through the HR Public info folder and cobble together a defense. I found a load of juicy rules and regulations that I can use.

I learned that if Toiletman goes down the bullying/harassment path stating that I've created a hostile work environment for him then it can be classed as gross misconduct and I could be fired on the spot. I'll try to avoid that one.

I spoke to the manager who had been doing the statements and told him I'd like the one given on monday omitted as it was given under false pretenses, I didn't know that I was being implicated in anything and didn't have a real chance of defending myself from the accusations. I then asked him what I was being accused of (via email) and he said that because the information spread like wildifre that they're looking to make an example out of me (paraphrased).

He said he's firmly on my side (which is good to know) and can take my time writing up a new statement regarding all of the events and do it on works time. Manager told me not to worry too much as the most he thinks I'll get is a little slap on the wrist, but I'm ardent that I'm not being the fallguy for this.

I've gathered a lot of information regarding contractual terms of employment, disciplinary procedures and reasons for actions taken. I've found some very juicy stuff in the 'misuse of IT equipment' section of the HR folder, and the victimisation section of the bullying/harassment passages too.

I'm going to speak to ACAS soon, but I've not said anything/done anything more regarding my involvement today. "
