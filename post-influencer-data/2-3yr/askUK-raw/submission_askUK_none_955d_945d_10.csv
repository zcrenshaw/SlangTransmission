"Am I the only one who thinks our modern world is bloody fantastic?


It seems like an almost universal mythology has permeated British society (not exclusively I'll add). There's so much golden age propaganda, and just a general sense of pessimism as if we were living through the final days of the Roman Empire. It's not just the oldies either (although they seem to hold such views more frequently), but there are also plenty of young people who just seem to unquestioningly take up this narrative.

I say no, the world is not falling apart, the world is, in fact, better and richer than it ever has been. Yes, you could buy a house on a 10 year mortgage back in the 60s, but guess what you couldn't buy? A cure for your dying child that has been invented with modern technology, nor could you buy a flight to a city 1000 miles away for less than the value of a day's earning on minimum wage. It might've not taken a master's degree and 2 years experience to get an entry level job with a semi-decent salary, but these days you can know more about the world sitting in your pyjamas eating serial in front of your computer than any master's student could've ever dreamed of getting their hands on in 1965. Literally anyone can become incredibly knowledgeable about a topic in a way that only a tiny number of rich and privileged academics were able to only 30 years ago. 

The past was objectively shitter in virtually every single way (which is why conservatism is so ridiculous). Not just like a bit worse, like horrendously awful. The 60s, the 70s, the 80s? Just bloody awful. The meagre advantages they did offer over our era pale in comparison to our 21st century life. Not to mention the constant and very real threat of nuclear annihilation of all modern civilisation (and yet now some people are sitting at home getting themselves in a hysteria of righteous indignation about ISIS? The least scary threat to our modern society since Lady Chatterley's Lover?)

As for moral decline; it's only relatively recently that we stopped lobotomising the mentally ill, medically sterilising homosexuals, and damning unwed mothers to lives of hardship and social exclusion until their dying day.

I can only conclude that all this nostalgia is nothing more than some kind of collective neurosis, that social pluralism has led to a crisis of identity within the current collective zeitgeist.

People in the past sat around in cold drafty houses with shit and limited food and barely anything to experience in the world around them yet they felt happy because the virtually completely homogeneous culture and patronising war-like government constantly boosted their egos and told them things were great. Nowadays people sit at home reading newpapers despairing at how the world is going to pot while having an entire world of remarkable opportunity outside beckoning. We're obsessed with dystopian visions and doomsaying predictions about the future of the human race, it's even permeated into our art and culture. Are we so vain as to have become stuck in a image of ourselves as the lost children sitting at the end of history mourning the passing of the world? It's time for this imagery to become clich√©. 

It's about time we got a grip and it's only the younger generation that have the will and energy to challenge the plague of mental passivity and negativity that has is currently dominating our society. Does anyone else agree? I feel like the world has been suffering from this mental sickness since the start of this millennium.

edit: I'll also add if anyone has any suggestions about how this social sickness can be negated, about what kind of things would need to happen to cure it, I'd be interested to hear them."

I just don't feel anything for it anymore, sounds awful and I'm definitely an arse but I'm well over the McCann content."
