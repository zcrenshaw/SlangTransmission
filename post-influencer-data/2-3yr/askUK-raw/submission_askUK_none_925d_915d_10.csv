"CeX employees - do you have any guidelines about shop presentation and music etc? Because the shops are pretty... unique!


Whilst it's possible to sometimes get some decent bargains on ~~stolen~~ secondhand gear in CeX shops, they're unique in retail in that (aside from the kind of secondhand bookshops that the owner regards as his private library and doesn't really *want* to sell customers anything, which Black Books does a fair job of representing) they're quite skanky and nasty. 

The music that seems to be played in them is a type of metal that even I, as someone that's braved the mud at Download and survived and plays in a band that tours the diviest of dives of Camden and Brighton, can't identify and seems to be the kind of thing that's made by American wrestlers that start bands. 

Guys - wtf? Is it really a case that management just DGAF or is there a deliberate policy to create an environment that attracts people that mostly just play console games who might be scared by bright lights and clean surfaces? Is the music there to drive out normies and muggles?

Help me to understand what's going on, as it seems to go against virtually all of the normal rules of retail. Not being snobby here ~~actually I probably am~~ but I really don't get it."
"What's your strategy to attack an all you can eat buffet?


Going to an oriental buffet, I made the mistake of filling up on the fried stuff and never got to try out most of the menu."
