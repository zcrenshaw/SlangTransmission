"Refugees from the Sainsbury's meal deal, where did you end up?


Amongst the other tragedies of 2016, many of us know the pain of the death of the great Sainsbury's meal deal.  

So where did people go?  Stayed with Sainsburys under protest?  Boots?  Tesco (who apparently already got their sandwiches from the supplier Sainsbury's switched to)?  Or living like a king at Pret?

**Edit:**  I fear this thread has just degenerated into ""describe your lunch"", but oh well, it's Christmas.  Also the smug home lunch buyers are coming out in their droves.  Well, unless you are going to make *all* our lunches, we still need a new meal deal."
"Why is the UK more tolerant towards mixed relations than the US


Ive always wondered about this. Im from the US, but you guys seem so much calmer about mixed couples than we are. We claim to be tolerant. But its still hidden in the surface.

Edit: Im not saying the UK is a utopia. No country is perfect. But if you""ve lived here for more than a year and consumed the media. Then you know my position."
