"Lie at work got out of hand - is my job at risk?


I started a job about 8-9 months ago, it's been great. I've been settling in fine, except for one thing. Everybody in my office thinks I am fluent in Chinese - I am not. 

When I was interviewing for the job they asked if I had any extra things that I enjoyed out of work and I'd read about how languages can make you more employable and seem interesting, so I lied and said 'I speak Chinese actually, taught through self study and some time studying there.' Out of all the lies on my CV that greatly exaggerated my work experience, this one stuck. I've no idea why I said it, but I was just desperate to secure some work and thought it would be forgotten.

Before I'd even started, word got round. For months people have been saying to me around the office 'wow it's really cool you can speak Chinese, what's the word for _____?'.  

I thought it would die out, so I've just been making random noises like 'ming bing' and 'shee chow' and similar thinking that it sounded good enough and people would then soon forget. I've also been telling stories from 'my time in China' which have been horrific, I found out the other day about me saying I visited the great Wall in Beijing was factually incorrect - there is no part of the wall there! 

Anyway, what should I do? Speaking Chinese is nothing to do with my job and there is no foreseeable way it could be, but I'm concerned if I get found out somehow I'll be dismissed. People have been walking around the office making gibberish sounds that are the words I've 'taught' them. 

Please help, any advice?

Edit: I've just come home from work to find this has gotten slightly more popular than one might hope and I know at least one guy will probably browse reddit tonight. Oh dear. I think I better tell my boss before he finds out and tells me. 

Thank you for all the replies, or as they say in China 'xao bao (?) '.

"My parents are planning to kick me out on results day, any advice?


My parents spent Â£3000 on tuitions in the last 2 years and have told me if I don't get AAA or above they will kick me out. (I am 99.9% Certain I will get BBB to CCC)


I am in year 13 and results day is in mid august and I don't know what to do.


Last year they kicked my sister out because she was 19 (and in uni) as she was a lesbian and have fully cut her off. "
