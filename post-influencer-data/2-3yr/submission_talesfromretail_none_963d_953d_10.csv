"""Some idiot put this cake's writing in cursive!""


In college, I worked for a floral shop that shared a space with a bakery. We had the space for both businesses to operate and it naturally was a good partnership. This story takes place near the end of my senior year. I was six weeks shy of graduating with two degrees. Although I cared about the stores and wanted them to do well, my nonsense-tolerance had dropped significantly. One day, a woman came to me for balloons for her son's 2nd birthday party. She had already picked up her cake.

Woman (grumpily tossing her balloon choices at me): Ugh, I can't believe the bakery. 

Me: Oh, is there something wrong?

Woman: Yes! LOOK at this cake! 

She opens the box. It's a nice looking cake, decorated with icing and trains. A scrolling script says: ""Happy 2nd Birthday Jackson!""

Me: ...

Woman: DON'T YOU SEE IT?! 

Me: I think it's a lovely ca-""

Woman: IT'S IN CURSIVE! WHY THE ***F#CK*** WOULD THEY PUT IT IN CURSIVE? HE'S TWO!

Me: Oh...well, it'll take me a couple minutes to fill these balloons. I bet you could take it back, and they could scrape off the old lettering, re-frost the blank space, and rewrite it for you. 

Woman (clearly hasn't heard a word I said): I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE IS SO STUPID TO THINK THIS IS OKAY! 

Me (yelling above her): CAN YOUR SON EVEN READ?! 

She immediately fell silent, blushed a deep purple, and was silent while I filled her balloons. She paid without a word.

"I've been here for an HOUR!


My store closes at 5:00 PM. We also test pool/hot tub water.

Today at 4:10 a car pulled into our parking lot. We are a small store so the parking lot is small and right in front of the front doors.

I make my way over to the register to hang out for 20 seconds before they come in. Or so I thought..

5 or so minutes pass and the person still hasn't gotten out of their car. So I go and busy myself cleaning counters, figuring as soon as I start a task they will come in. That's how it always seems to work!

It's now 4:30 and the person is still in their car, with it running. I decide to do the garbages and lock up the back. When I come back it's now 4:50. Person is still in their running car.

My supervisor starts to do the cash, it is now 4:57. I go to the window and wave the customer inside. They have no tint on their car so I can see them look at me. They wave their hand in a ""brushing off"" motion and put their head back down. I ask my supervisor what to do, and she says to turn off the open sign and start locking up slowly.

So I flick off the open sign. I chain the door... the lights go off. We grab our things and head to our cars. Once I get into my car, my supervisor has left already. It is 5:10 now. I get out to brush the snow off and I hear a throat clearing behind me. I turn and see the customer (C) standing there with her brow furrowed and her arms crossed, holding a water bottle in one hand.

&gt;C: Um... why are you guys leaving? I have a water sample.

&gt;Me: We close at 5, sorry! I tried to wave you in but I assumed that you were waiting for someone since you waved me off.

&gt;C: You should have knocked on my window.

&gt;Me: I'm sorry but it is -16 out here and I don't have a coat so I really don't want to go outside if it isn't necessary. Like right now I'm shivering and would like to go home. You're free to come back tomorrow though!

*I move to get into my car*

&gt;C: Hey! My sample! You have to test it!!

&gt;Me: I can't..?

&gt;C: UGH I have been here for over an hour!

&gt;Me: Yes but you sat in your car from just after 4 until now so why is it suddenly so urgent? I'm really sorry but I'm freezing and I need to go home so please come back tomorrow and I'll help you ok? Have a good night.

*I get in my car*

She started rapping on my window and repeating ""Hey! Get out here!! My water!!"" So I slowly (very slowly) pulled forward until I could turn and she was out of the way and drove off.

People confuse me."
