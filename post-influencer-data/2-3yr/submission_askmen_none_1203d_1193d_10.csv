"What's your favorite porn sub on reddit?


Been awhile since I've seen this question."

"What's the most ""feminine"" thing you do?


Feminine is in quotations because I'm talking about society's terms of masculinity and femininity.

Mine would probably be shaving my armpits, that I can think of.

Edit: My voice comes off as feminine with my vowels, apparently.  
      
Also, thanks for replying everyone &lt;3.  There are some real ""feminine"" guys/(girls?) here.  Keep doing you."
"What's the story behind your worst date, in which you were the guilty one?


To put a little twist on a common question... tell me about the worst date you've ever been on, in which YOU were primarily responsible for fucking it up. 

A couple days ago, I went on a date where I fucked up royally. I met a girl online, who basically had everything I was looking for in a girl. She was gorgeous, a top-tier athlete, smart, and fun to talk to. Our date started great at first, we just walked around town and got to know each other. We even kissed while enjoying a scenic view -- I had the butterflies the entire time. Later on, things led to us making out in the back of my car. We agreed to go somewhere private, so I ended up driving towards my place when I couldn't find a secluded spot in town. Thing is, I didn't make it clear to her where we were going, and that's how I fucked up. I basically kidnapped this girl. She seemed fine with wherever I was going at first, but once we got to my place, she seemed a little uncomfortable. She told me she needed to be back home soon, so we just ended up fooling around and cuddling for a bit before heading back. I later on realized what I had done, and apologized to her for not communicating clearly. She told me that she did feel a little uncomfortable at the time, because we had just met. Needless to say, there's no way there'll be a second date. 

In the end, this incident really opened my eyes to the fact that I need to just take a step back and chill when it comes to girls. I let thirst get the best of me, which not only ruined what could've been something more, but also ended up making the girl uncomfortable. Now, I'm looking to take a small break from dating until I feel like I'm ready again. "

"Is ""shower beer"" a real thing? Men, do you drink beer in the shower? Why?


I can't tell if people in real life actually do it, or if it's just some internet gag. I love beer, and the thought of drinking one in the shower seems stupid as hell. "
"What was your favorite Lego set or custom build?


Definitely going with the [alien ship](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UaZ0ik-oTK8/hqdefault.jpg). So many universal parts... The fucking thing broke apart into ***2*** separate ships, too!

Knex plebs stay out. We all know how great the roller coaster was, but you've been living in those 15 minutes for too long now"
"Is it shallow to lose attraction to a girl after finding out what she looks like without makeup?


For instance, someone you recently met but don't interact with that often

EDIT: I'll clarify by saying I meant losing physical attraction to someone you're currently non-intimate with, not judging them or treating them differently."
"Asian guys and girls, how does the culture of not expressing your love directly affect your relationships?


Growing up, my parents would never express their love to each other, or to me. It would always be in the form of ""Have you eaten yet?"". I know this is very common among Asians, and was wondering if y'all changed it up in your own relationships.

Note: In the title, by ""directly"" i mean ""openly"""
"Would you rather be in a relationship where the sex is awful but everything else is incredible, or one where the sex is incredible but everything else is awful? Why?


Obviously neither relationship is great, but if you had to pick"
"What do you think about the whole 'woman standing next to you in a bar wanting you to say hi' thing?


This has been bothering me for some time now, cause I find it annoying as hell. For those not knowing what I mean: you're in a bar and suddenly a girl/woman ( and usually her bff ) is standing next to you. The one that likes you usually has her ass turned towards you, with the bff looking into space like she's rainman. Now even an overthinking idiot like me can tell it's the 'talk to me' sign but 9/10 times I just can't be arsed with it. 

I find it a turnoff for some reason and my friends/coworkers are always 'dude why won't you say hi to her'. Hell last friday I went drinking with coworkers and this one girl was next to me for hours.. I didn't feel like talking ( screaming in her ear over the music, not understanding a thing she's saying ) and she wasn't really my type. After a while my coworker couldn't stand it anymore and introduced me, but I wasn't interested cause she weirded me out a little ( who stands next to a random guy for hours on end? ) and he got her number instead :p She got bonus points for gently making asscontact with my leg a couple of times though. 

So my question would be what do my fellow men think about this whole thing. Do you like it, do you say hi even if you're not interested or are you like me and can't be bothered ( and get made fun of by your friends because of it ).

"What is your thought process when seeing a picture of an attractive naked woman?


I'm asexual, and I would like to how men think when they see a naked woman.

Let's use [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/H9oykhl.jpg) as an example.

For me, I see the face, think she looks cute and wouldn't mind kissing her, but that's where it ends. Actually, I would prefer if she was wearing some clothes.

So how do you guys think (assuming you're straight)? Do you think ""I wouldn't mind fucking her""? Would it have made a difference if she was wearing lingerie? Do you look at her vagina and think ""That's a nice pussy, I want to stick my dick in there""? 

For me, that instinct isn't there. If I would stick my dick in there it would rather feel forced than natural. ""I'm supposed to stick my dick in there?""

Maybe I sound ridiculous but that's because I have no idea how you guys think. I'm just making assumptions here. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: To be clear, that's not what I'm actually thinking in words. That's just my thought process put into words. I'm not expecting you guys to think like that either. But if you were to put your thinking in words, what would it be?

EDIT 2: Some people are asking me about what it's like being asexual. Though that is very different for a lot of asexuals, I wrote a bit about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4luh49/what_is_your_thought_process_when_seeing_a/d3qh553?context=3)."
"If a girl tells you on the first date that shes not really emotionally available and she's not ready for anything serious, what's your plan of action?


I ask because I'm on a dating site and I put that in my description. I'm fresh out of a 3 year relationship and I'm not ready to get serious but I'd like to go on dates and meet new guys. 

The thing is.. I think one guy I've been talking to is hanging around to try to jump in when I'm ready to get serious but I honestly want to stay single for maybe a year (I'm also going through major career changes and I'd like to have a clear head in my decision making and nothing holding me back). 

Just wondering how the general /r/askmen population would approach this."
