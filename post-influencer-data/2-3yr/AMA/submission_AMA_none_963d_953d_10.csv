"I'm a high school dropout, lied about my education and got a high paying job.


I'm 31, dropped out of high school.. not because it wasn't challenging, but because I was bored and didn't put in any effort. I'll be honest I skated through the first 20 years of my life. At 20 years old, being a high school dropout I was working at dominos pizza making under 10 bucks an hour I really had no direction in life.  I was looking at options, but anything to make a decent living on and not break your back in manual labor needed a college degree. 

I updated my resume, and lied about everything. I said I had a degree. I passed it out to as many places as I could..I got a few interviews and some actually required proof, while others didn't really care. 

Got a job for my city in the corporate headquarters when I was 23 being an intern. I then worked my up through the years into middle management. I'm now 31, and make 97k a year... and have people working under me with actual degree's while I'm a drop out.
