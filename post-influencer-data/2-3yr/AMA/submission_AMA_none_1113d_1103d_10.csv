But I wish I was and I'll try and answer as if I am. "
"I'm a 39 year old female who at age 30 went from perfect hearing to totally deaf in less than 3 weeks. AMA!


So a little back ground. In 2003 I was diagnosed with stage 3 small cell liver cancer which metastasized to lungs and breast.   Went through chemo and radiation and multiple surgeries over the span of almost 5 years. I was declared No Evidence of Cancer (NEC) in November of 2007. While having the cancer I was prescribed OxyContin and lortab 10/500 for breakthrough pain. If you're not familiar with pain medicine this means there was 10 mg of hydrocodone and 500mg of Tylenol in ever tablet. I was taking 1-2 ever 6 hours as needed. Anyway, in December of 2007, so a month after NEC, I started getting funny noises in my ears. I described it to my husband as it was like someone was playing space invaders in my head. It was almost Christmas and I kept saying I would go see my doctor after every thing settled down in the holiday season. Over the next few days my husband and children noticed they had to repeat themselves a lot more when talking to me and the tv was getting louder and louder when I was watching it. We were visiting my parents about three hours away from our home Christmas Eve through NYE. The day after Christmas my husband put his foot down and said he's taking me to the hospital. The ER Doctor said I had an inner ear infection and gave me a Z-pack and prednisone. He said my hearing should slowly improve over the next couple days. Three days later it was obviously not better in fact worse. Went back to the ER, saw same dr. Upped the antibiotics dose and prednisone. Said this would take care of it. The next day I was laying in bed and my ears made a noise like someone was letting the air out of a tire or balloon. It's  so odd that I remember this as the exact time I realized I could hear nothing. I sat up, woke my husband and said talk to me. All I saw was his lips move. I started hysterically crying. Went back to the ER, different Doctor. The dr immediately called the ENT on call who came in. He checked my ears and said there was no infection and my ear drums were perfect. He referred me to an audiologist for a hearing test. At the time I thought that was silly I knew I couldn't hear. Now I understand that they needed to find out if I could hear any tones at all, how high pitched or how low. Two days later got the hearing test. I had 4% hearing in my right ear, 16% in my left. Went back to the ENT, who said they had one last shot at saving my hearing. He was frank and said he thought it was pointless, but at least they tried everything at this point. He gave me a shot of steroids straight into my cochlea. Through my ear drums. The needle was about 10 inches long and it was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. No dice my hearing was gone.

So at this point I'm now profoundly deaf. My children are 3, 3, and 8. I went to see another audiologist/ENT at UW in Seattle. They confirmed everything the small town docs said. I asked why? What made this happen. They don't know for sure, but two possibilities. One, I went through chemo for so long that it killed all the nerve that send the sound signals to my brain. Two, there was new information coming in at that time, early 2008, that too much Tylenol can cause hearing loss. So the Lortabs I was taking for pain control could have caused it. There's no way of ever figuring out which.

The doctors at UW were the first to tell me about cochlear implants; I had never heard of them before. I thought I was just going to face life deaf from the on. They explained that while not perfect, they allow people to hear at about 50% of what normal is. So they submitted it to my insurance. 9 months later I got the approval for one ear, not both. I was ecstatic. Bummed about not getting both ears but so excited at the prospect of hearing again. Had the implant surgery in October 2008 and had my implant ""turned on"" November of 2008.

So that's my story. Sorry so long, but wanted you to have the background info. Now AMA!
