"I was beaten, later shot, and later had my identity stolen; all because of a divorce. AMA


I went through a divorce in 2008. On New Years 2009, the ex wifes new boyfriend threatened to ""whip me"". That's the first charge (terroristic threatening). About 2 weeks later he pepper sprayed me and beat me with a club. That's the second charge (assault). While out on bail, he shot me on my way to work. That's the third charge (assault 1st). 
While he was in jail, the ex wife used my identity to try to find out where I lived. She was charged with felony identity theft. AMA

&gt; Would you mind elaborating on the details of the beating and the shooting?

&gt; Did he follow you around for a while? Shoot at your car as you drove by? 
&gt; Did other people see it? Any permanent damage other than scars and such?



The beating happened during a visitation exchange. I was dropping off the kids. He walked up to me and accused me of harassing his daughter. He quickly pepper sprayed me, then he had a small club (police use them, called a blackjack). He hit me repeatedly. I had my arm up to protect my head. I can still hear him grunting with every swing. He was a lot smaller guy than me. The pepper spray hurt the worst because it took my breath and burned. Days later though, I would drop things I was holding in my hand. I guess that was due to nerve damage. 

The ex followed me for a while. I noticed and would tell people. Mainly because she had a restraining order on me, and I thought she was trying to frame me. I had moved to a new place and she still followed me. I believe she relayed that information to him. 

The morning I was shot, I noticed a strange car parked a few houses away. As I pulled out, the car followed me. When I stopped at a red light, he rolled down his window and shot me (he was the passenger). The bullet fractured my humerus. There were a few cars behind me that saw the cars side by side. There were people that heard the gunshots. No one else actually saw the shooting. 

The only damage I think is emotional damage. Maybe PTSD? I say maybe because no one has diagnosed me with anything. I still have bouts of anxiety. "
"I am a Psychologist who works in the slums of Mexico City with homeless, drug addicted children (ages 6-17) AMA


I work with several organisations specialised in rehabilitating homeless children who are addicted to several drugs, like Thinner (an industrial paint removal), crack, cocaine, marihuana, alcohol etc. 
I go to the streets and slums and find where they live. Then we try to start a process where they can find an irregular job (helping out in a store without a contract, for example) and stay out of drugs via other activities (sports, films). 

This comes with complementary therapy. 

EDIT 1: I'm gonna go sleep. I will keep answering any and all questions. Thanks for reading. 

EDIT 2: I'm back, good morning. 

EDIT 3: The AMA seems to be coming to an end. I'll be answering questions even if it's long gone. If I get the message/notification, I will answer you. "
"I am a fifty-five year old man that went from the Vice President of a prestigious luxury hotel to being unemployed that last five years of my life. AMA.


I initially quit my job in the hopes of advancing my career, but the last five years have brought nothing but disappointment. I have applied to over 300 jobs, the majority of them for positions significantly lower than the ones I have held in the past, and yet I remained unemployed. Along with this I was recently diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis)."
