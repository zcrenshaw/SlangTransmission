"(AMA Request) Someone who has tried McDonald's Szechuan sauce


As a promotion for the movie Mulan, McDonald's created this sauce for a limited time in the 90s. Rick and Morty recently referenced it. How did it taste like?"
"Hi, Iâ€™m travelling to EVERY single country in the world in a single UNBROKEN JOURNEY, without the use of flight. 125 countries now! Ask me anything!



Hello everyone, I'm Thor from Denmark in the north of Europe. I'm here to tell you a little bit about OUAS ;)

This is day 1,264 and we have reached 125 countries across 4 continents (161,000 km / 100,000 mi).

You are welcome to Ask Me Anything, read up on it here below or watch this short video to get some quick answers:

Welcome one and all! :)

What is OUAS?

Once Upon A Saga is a complicated logistical challenge of historical proportions! It also has great humanitarian value and a source for inspiration for many who cross its path.

In short, the ""Saga"" is the quest for 1 man to reach every single country in the World in a single unbroken journey - completely without the use of flight! Although the World has been conquered geographically by travellers many times throughout history, a flightless journey is a feat that has never before been achieved...until now.

In order to understand the ""Saga"" better it can be seen as 3 individual projects:

1)
A journey to every country without flight with all of its complicated logistics (203 countries). This is a World Record attempt.

2)
A positive promotion of each country sharing stories of positive experiences to counter the negatives we see in the media (203 countries). 

3)
A positive promotion of the Red Cross Red Crescent movement which was founded in 1863 and today spans across 190 nations. I'm honored to travel as Goodwill Ambassador of the Danish Red Cross.

As such, the Saga is known to provide three elements for those who partake:
- Inspiration
- Entertainment
- Education

So, join us on the journey by spreading the word, that A STRANGER IS A FRIEND YOU'VE NEVER MET BEFORE! ;)

Thor ;)

"I am fully able to control my dreams, no limits. AMA.


Lucid dreaming: the ability to fully control your dreams, when you are aware that you are dreaming. 
In my case I lucid dream every night without fail.

Edit: wow, awesome to see so many are interested in lucid dreaming. If there are still questions unanswered or if you want me to elaborate, feel free to ask.

Sweet dreams!"

"Grew up poor only to find out at 18 yrs old I was a millionaire


hi im Sophie, im a 18 year old girl from Minnesota and my best friend recommended I do a AMA

my mother left us when I was 4 years old and ive been raised by my pop my ever since

i never had many toys or things like a phone or computer but I grew up very happy and I had friends at school who made my life amazing

when I was about 9 things got really hard, my pop lost his job and we had to live off of plain bread and small snack food

my life completely turned around when i turned 18 in January, my pop sat me down and explained that some money had been left for me for when I turn 18

life is different but not too different now, ive seen people make AMAs about being rich but my best friend said i should make this because i grew up poor with no idea i came from a wealthy family

AMA as long as it doesn't reveal my identity!"
