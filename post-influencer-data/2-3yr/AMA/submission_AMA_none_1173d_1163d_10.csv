"[AMA REQUEST] Somebody who actually lives in or around Rio de Janeiro.. how bad IS IT for the olympics?


I'm looking for people who actually live in or around Rio. My main question is, are the olympics really going to be as unsafe as the mainstream media is actually making it out to be? I saw an article on CNN that says ""Rio police tell tourists they won't be able to protect them"". Another article is about some crazy ""super bacteria"" in the water.

A part of me just wants to think this is the mainstream media's way of getting more attention. I'd like to hear an actual opinion from somebody living a day to day life in or around Rio."
