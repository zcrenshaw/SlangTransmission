"I have had schizophrenia since early childhood. AMA!


Hey, guys! Schizophrenia Awareness is next month but I'll be swamped with exams then so I decided to do an AMA now. I did one last year and was able to answer a lot of good questions, so if you guys have any questions about schizophrenia (or anything random), I'd love to do my best to answer! "
