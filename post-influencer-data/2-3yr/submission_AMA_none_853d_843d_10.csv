"Daughter of a heroin addict who I live with and interact with as if she's not a heroin addict. AMA!


My mom has been intravenously shooting heroin since I was 12/13. I am 24. My father is sober and hasn't touched alcohol or used drugs in over a decade. He supports her habit by giving her free access to his bank account. We live together as one happy family (I have two siblings who don't live home, but they also behave as such). We are a white, upper-middle class family who live in a small town about an hour from NYC. Most days, the drug addiction isn't discussed. If she's obviously high, I just leave the room and I try to spend a lot of time not at home (I work full time and am graduating school on Friday). She gets it. She's very remorseful but not ready to change. AMA"
