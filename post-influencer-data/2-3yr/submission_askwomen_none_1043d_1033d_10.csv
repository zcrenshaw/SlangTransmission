"Ladies of Reddit, what's your side hustle?


I just bought a new car and am thinking about driving for Uber or Lyft for some money. I already sell my clothes on Poshmark and fill out surveys in my free time for cash. What do you do?"

"For those who have been cheated on, looking back, did you know something was off while it was happening? How did it affect your relationship even when it was a secret?


Update: 
So the overwhelming answer to this question is YES! people know when something is up, and it is almost always your intuition telling you. The next most common reason is that the SO starts acting distant and irritable. And the next most common thing is that they start to get really secretive about their phones. 

What I'm getting from all of this mostly, is that there is a divide between the two people when someone is cheating that you can't help but feel. When your SO is with you, like really with you, you feel it, and when they're love or attention or sex drive is somewhere else, you feel that too no matter if the reason is a secret or not. 

Secrets have agendas of their own I guess, are very powerful, and will eventually find their way out. Thanks everybody for sharing. :/ "

"I, 21M, was just sexually assaulted at a club for the first time and am furious. Can't believe you ladies deal with this constantly - how do you do it?


Edit: sorry, I fell asleep while answering because as you can imagine, I'm recovering from a hangover and little sleep...

Anyway: This thread blew up way bigger than expected - thank you all so much for the advice, kind words, and letting me vent out to you guys. 

I'm so sorry to hear from all those who've experienced truly disgusting things, and even more sorry to hear from those who've become numb to it. It's unfair and infuriating that that's just the way it is sometimes. Wishing you all the best. 

Didn't get the chance to reply to each comment, but I assure you I've read every single one. Might reply later when I get the chance.
