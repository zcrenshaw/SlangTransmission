"Harvard College recently rescinded admissions acceptances to at least 10 incoming members of the Class of 2021 for posting offensive memes in a private Facebook group. What are your thoughts on this story? Do you think Harvard was right to revoke the admissions?


Some students think it is an infringement on their free speech.  Memes included jokes about sexual assault, the Holocaust, and the deaths of children.  Other memes were slurs directed at ethnic minorities."
"anyone else the ""ugly friend""? If so, how do you deal with it?


I was never too pretty. My best friend though, she could be a Vogue model. I love her to death, but I hate going out in public with her. So many times random strangers will compliment her, calling her things like beautiful and stunning, all while I just stand there and smile awkwardly like the potato I am. I can't help but feel mad and want to cry when it happens-- just how some people can be so rude when I'm kind of standing RIGHT there.
I would love to hear from others with similar experiences and how you handle(d) it. Much thanks.

EDIT: Wow, thanks so much for the positive insight (and some rude :P)! Honestly it makes me feel better to know I'm not alone in this, and all of your personalities and stories are incredible. ""Ugly"" girls unite!"
"What common advice given to women from popular media is actually terrible life advice in practice?


One of the big ones I see in romcoms like 'How I Met Your Mother' is that a women should play hard to get as to filter out any men who aren't *really* into you and the one guy that doesn't give up is the guy that cares about you more than anyone else and therefore your 'true love'.  Reality?  That's how you filter out all the men who respect your boundaries and ensure you're only left with guys who are obsessive and controlling.  

What other sorts of bad advice do you think popular media has normalized?"
