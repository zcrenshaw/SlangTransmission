"[Update] I [30M] made a huge mistake/oversight, and really hurt my cousin [24F] right before my wedding. How do I fix this?


So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update.

The TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings.

Anyways, on to the update.

I was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship.

Anyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.)

My fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said ""So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin.""

Emily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship.

She had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) ""went bridezilla"" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.)

She also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for ""her screwup.""

Guys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot.

Molly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to ""quit being such a whiner"" and enjoy my wedding.

So the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation.

The wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty.

The only thing she asked was if the ""Blame Emily"" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come.

She actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the ""adults"" and ""younger kids"" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.)

**TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends.

**Minor Update to the update-** 

So... it turns out ""Molly"" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: ""Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?""

So going forward, please replace ""Molly"" with ""Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains.""

Oh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW!

She's still coming to game night though. :)"

"[Update] My [18] parents keep insisting that I'm gay and I'm getting tired of it.


Link to original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rjhzw/my_18_parents_keep_insisting_that_im_gay_and_im/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rjhzw/my_18_parents_keep_insisting_that_im_gay_and_im/).

My first post left me very confused. I had a hard time believing it was possible to be *that* in denial about my own sexuality. I honestly considered deleting my post and try to forget about it because it just made me so uncomfortable. I didn't delete it but I tried to not think about it and just focused on what I was going to do about the bullying. It didn't really work though and a couple days after I was hanging out with my friend (the guy I asked why everyone thought I was gay) and he asked me about it and I sort of had a melt down. I told him I was confused about everything and that I wasn't sure anymore if I was straight and that his texts and your comments had really screwed with my head. He was great though and managed to calm me down. I felt a lot better after talking to him about it and when I got home I read your comments again and /u/lamamaloca 's comment

&gt;Considering your edit, you might want to engage in some self reflection about who you're actually attracted to. I can completely understand why they think you're gay, and this isn't about just engaging in stereotypes. This is about other people noticing signs in you of arousal and interest.

&gt;You don't need to tell me these things, but think about them for yourself: what do you think about when you masturbate? Do you get aroused around girls or guys? Who are you drawn to, where does your energy focus? Pay attention to how you feel and how your body responds when you interact with each sex. When you kissed your girlfriend, was it super exciting and physically arousing? How do you feel if you imagine kissing a girl? What if you imagine kissing a guy? To which did your body respond? Maybe both? Also don't discount the possibility of being asexual or demisexual but homoromantic (or possibly heterotomantic), that could make things more difficult to figure out.

The first time I read this comment it literally made me feel sick and the second time it made me feel sick as well. That night I actually took her advice though and for the first time in my life I actually imagined what it would be like to kiss a guy and I'm definitely not straight. I'm not sure if I'm bi or gay but I'm not straight. I've done a lot of reading and exploring after that night and it's been difficult to accept it but I feel like I've come a long way in a short time. 

I still think it's weird that I was that deep in denial about it though. My whole life I was 100% sure I was straight and then now I'm 100% sure I'm not straight. It's weird. I told my friend about it a few days ago and he was awesome about it. I knew he would be okay with it but I was still nervous. I haven't told my parents yet and I'll probably wait until I have it more figured out. I haven't decided what to do about the bullying though. I feel like it won't bother me as much anymore and maybe if they see that I don't really care they'll get bored of it. I just hope it doesn't get worse. 

I just wanted to update you guys and thank you for your advice and comments. It literally changed my life and I'm not sure how long it would've kept living in denial if it weren't for you guys, so thank you.

**tl;dr**: Neded advice on how to stop my parents insisting I was gay. Turns out I'm not actually straight."
"UPDATE: I [34/f] turned to my husband [34/m] for support after some bad news. He pointed out a blemish on my face in response. Is this a big enough straw to break the camel's back?


Thank you so much to everyone who commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/44zp5v/i_34f_turned_to_my_husband_34m_for_support_after/) earlier this year!

We got into counseling not too long after that post and have been continuing every week ever since.  We just had a session yesterday.  Our counselor is wonderful, she really understands the situation and has identified the struggle my husband faces when confronted with an uncomfortable topic, like our losses, stress at work, the decision to have children or not, and more.

We have spent quite a long time discussing my husband's upbringing.  His family isn't really big on communicating, and there are many problems that he and his siblings have had over the years (and continue to this day) that were never addressed and never resolved.  In session he talked about how he felt his emotional needs were never really met growing up, but that he didn't realize it until now.  It made me really sad for him.  We had his parents over a few weeks ago and as usual, the conversation remained really superficial and never delved into anything very substantial.  I have tried to share with them about our life and our losses before, but there's never been any sign of interest from them in connecting with us in that way, even though his mother is one of the only people I know in my life who has suffered a loss as well.  We spent the next week's session processing their visit, and unfortunately my husband felt a lot of anger and frustration that he wasn't able to talk to them about the important stuff.

However, in our relationship things have completely transformed.  We argue so much less, and he is completely present and there for me when I need his support.  The topic of having children has come back up, and we are still figuring that out, but we can really talk about it and be open and honest with each other without fear and with respect and open arms for each other.  He has repeatedly said that he's really happy we got into therapy and that he feels great about the state of our relationship.  I'm almost happy we've gone through such hard times so that we were able to hit rock bottom and get to this wonderful place.

So, thank you to everyone for your kindness and generosity in following our journey.  

TL;DR: Poor communicator husband and I started therapy and now our relationship has completely transformed.  Thank you to everyone!"

"[UPDATE] Do I [20F] tell the guy I've been casually seeing [20M] that I am pregnant and am having an abortion on Friday


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4t5z5t/do_i_20f_tell_the_guy_ive_been_casually_seeing/

After reading all of your comments it became clear to me I needed to tell him. He called me just to chat this evening, and told me all about his trip but how excited he is to see me again. As we were talking, I realized I really like this guy and suddenly I felt this weight falling onto my shoulders. I had to tell him.

So I told him about 30 minutes ago over the phone. First he laughed, and thought I was joking about being pregnant. Once he realized I was serious, he got quiet, but kindly asked me to just run him through the logistics of what was going to happen and what it was going to do to me.

He was genuinely concerned for me and my wellbeing, and kept saying how thankful he was that I told him. He said he'd be there for me through the whole process, and that I don't need to worry about it changing anything between us. He was rather impressed by my matter-of-fact and practical approach to the matter- and that I had the appointment and funds covered without even talking to him.

I honestly think this just showed me that he is a really good guy and wants what is best for me. He seemed to appreciate my maturity and mostly appreciated me telling him.

Thanks so much to everyone who encouraged me to do this. It was 100% the right decision, and I feel even more sure about a possible relationship/future together!

Edit: Wow this blew up! Thank you SO much everyone for the thoughtful comments and advice. I feel much more at ease about the situation and am thankful for all of your words.

"My [25F] husband [35M] has been lying about working late for over a month now, leaving me alone to take care of our son. I'm furious and don't know what to do.


My husband and I have a 3 year old son together. In addition to our son, I also take care of our 4 year old niece -my husband's sister's daughter- on Fridays because she is a single mother and works full time. My husband volunteered me, but I was happy to do it because I work from home and she's a sweet girl. Plus it saves my sister-in-law money on daycare, so that's good, too. I originally agreed to do this because my husband works half-days on Friday, meaning he was home for the afternoon to help me out. Having two kids under 5 in the house is a handful, but I was able to handle the morning. 

Well, a month ago my husband told me his boss was upping his hours to work on a special project for the forseeable future. He would have to work an hour later on the weekdays and go back to full-days on Friday. This was a disappointment, but I didn't want to go put my sister-in-law in the tough position of trying to find and pay for a sitter on Fridays. So I figured I could handle the two kids, even if it would be tough. And I have. It's been difficult, I have to work later in the evenings because I don't get as much done in the day, but I've been managing it. 

Last Friday, I was at the grocery store with the kids. I saw my boss's wife and chatted to her for a bit. I made some comment about how much of a bummer it was how everyone was working more hours, and she looked confused. She said if that was happening her husband wasn't being a very good boss, because he was home every day like normal and working half Fridays. I ended the conversation and went home.

That night I asked my husband why if he was working more, his boss wasn't. He looked nervous and said that it was only for lower-level employees. I said that was bullshit and that he needed to tell me the truth. Turns out, he hasn't been working more. He's been going to hang out at a friend's house every day and on Friday afternoons he just does whatever the hell he wants. He said he needed a break from how busy we are with our son and on Fridays with our niece. 

I'm furious. First off, he lied to me. Secondly, he has left me alone to take care of *our* kid and *his* sister's kid, who he volunteered me to take care of! And I have absolutely no idea what to do. I told him he needs to be home at the correct time from now on, and he responded that he still ""needs his alone time"", and that the kids are ""too much."" Fucking yeah, it's a lot of work, but I have to deal with it all on my own? I mean, am I being unreasonable here? I get that it's a lot, but I don't feel like that gives him the right to unilaterally decide he can have some time off. What do I do? 



   
**tl;dr**: My husband lied about working to get out of taking care of our son and niece. I'm furious and don't know how to handle the situation."
"Me (26F) with my soon to be SILs (23/25F). One is causing drama over my engagement ring and now wants proof from my fiance about its worth. I'm worried about what family I'm marrying into with my fiance (27M)


I've been with my fiance Michael for almost four years now and it's been a great relationship so far. He proposed a month ago and we are both really excited to start our lives together. Hes truly wonderful. His family, well... :/

Michael does not live in the same state as his family anymore and as a result I've only met his family a few times. He has said before that some of his family members can be weird and he was even hesitant for me to meet his siblings. 

His siblings (both girls) are apparently really spoiled rotten individuals. Neither of the girls ever had to work while growing up and relied heavily on their parents money. Their parents treated them like royal princesses. Michael on the other hand was always expected to work from age 14 and go to school and achieve far more ( 4.0, be in  at least two clubs and two sports) than was expected of his sisters (who only were required to make Cs and do nothing more) Michael was rarely allowed to attend social events at school or go out on weekends. he did all chores and his parents treated him very different than his sisters. His sisters were incredibly mean to him as teenagers. Basically he was pushed around like a literal peasant until he had enough money to move out and was able to receive grants and scholarships to go to school. It was a lot of luck that played a part in his being able to attend undergrad and grad. If not for outside help, I believe his family would have left him to rot whilst giving the sisters everything they ever wanted. 

Michael is now an engineer while his sisters have basic minimum wage jobs (nothing wrong with that) however his sisters have done all they can to pester Michael about borrowing money, making him feel ashamed that he makes more money than they do, and even going as far as to claim that they deserve the money more than Michael does. They ask him monthly for money, which I just learned a year ago after Michael confessed to me in shame that he had been giving them money to help them through a rough patch for the past few months. 

Apparently their mom and dad has refused to continue to support them to the large extent that they have been the past several years (maybe they finally got fed up, who knows) and now the sisters are looking to Michael. 

Tina, Michaels eldest sister, is being really difficult lately. Apparently, she is bitter that Michael has not been giving her anymore money. And she is acting very strange about Michael's engagement. Apparently, Michael ""should he thinking about his family first"" before thinking of getting married and spending a bunch of money on a wedding and a wife. His sisters should be put first, apparently.  Now, supposedly she is pissed over my engagement ring. 

This past weekend Michael and I went to visit the family and Tina and the whole family obviously learned about our recent engagement. I had never even met Michael's dad before because he travels so much for work. His mom seemed passive towards me and his dad kept asking me what my name was. It made me sad tbh. 

Tina remarked on the large size of my engagement ring. Later in the day, she pulled Michael aside and told him that she was really suffering financially along with the rest of the family, and basically said. She was shocked Michael was forking over thousands of dollars for my engagement ring and the wedding rather than help out his own family. She said ""you've only known this chick for what, a few years? You're already giving her everything while you give your own family nothing."" 

Well, Michael then informed her that my ring wasn't real diamond. It is moissanite, which I specifically wanted instead of a diamond. Michael could easily afford a diamond but we are saving our money and I liked the idea of moissanite. 

But, Tina didn't believe that and expressed such. She stalked over to me in the kitchen and made a huge scene in front of everyone asking to see my ring, and examine it. She tried to play it off jokingly but I could see through it, and at one point she made a grab for my left hand. I refused to hand over my ring and Tina got emotional and the other sister, Hannah, soon butted in and asked what my problem was, Tina just wanted to look, what do I have to hide, etc. I just tried to calm the situation down as best I could and Michael kept telling them to mind their own business.

Honestly, the whole thing was infuriating. We left after dinner to go stay in a hotel. Michael then told me how he thinks his sister is also jealous of me and my ring. Tina has  been engaged for over a year now with still no wedding planned, she was given a tiny ring. Albeit with a real diamond but it is very tiny. Mine, though fake, is big and sparkly and she remarked to him once that he had better not get me a prettier looking ring than she had. (Wtf?) Michael and I will be getting married fairly soon and she seems bitter that her own fiance has still not expressed a desire to start planning the wedding. She has also remarked in the past to Michael how I am too beautiful, and that my looks are somehow suspicious, and I'm just out to get his money. 

I make my own money as a nurse and I definitely am not using Michael for his money. 

Now, Tina has started creating all sorts of drama over this, posting on Facebook about how real men should know where their priorities lie, how real men stick by family and don't play with little girls who are gold diggers who only care about having a huge rock. One status said ""show me the paperwork and I might believe the ring isn't real lol"" and another one was some stupid quote about being distracted by shiny things that turn out to be coal in disguise. (Me I'm guessing lol) she commented ""lmao 😂😂😂"" on my instagram picture of my ring. I deleted the comment.

I only know this about her Facebook statuses because Michael showed me through his account. Tina deleted me off of everything and even blocked me. She sent out a mass email to the whole family and announced that her and Hannah will not be attending my wedding nor supporting Michaels marriage to me and then listing all of the reasons. (I don't really love him. I'm a gold digger, Michael doesn't care about his family anymore) 
However at the end of the email she said she may consider believing Michael if she saw proof that my ring wasn't real.

Reddit, I'm at a complete loss as to what to do here. Michael is also shocked but not really because he is so used to his sisters' antics. He took my side and I appreciate that but when I talked to him about cutting his family off for good he seemed hesitant. I think he just doesn't wanna create more drama. But I need him to draw hard lines here.

The thing is, I don't want Tina and Hannah coming along every few months asking for money and judging us. I don't want my marriage to involve their pettiness and begging. I won't give any of my hard earned money to them, that's for sure. I don't want Michael to either but I guess I can't force him not to. I just worry because that could be money our future children need. Or money WE need. 

How can I handle this situation? At this point I never wanna see the sisters again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rg674/im_21f_having_roommate_problems_because_her_23f/


I know not many people saw my other post but I wanted to update anyways. She took all of my food out of the kitchen and put it in my mini fridge which she unplugged and left shut in my bedroom so the whole fridge became a disgusting mouldy mess. She did that because she said she didn't want me in common areas of the apartment anymore if I couldn't dress appropriately (and I was just wearing normal shorts!) yet somehow she thinks it's perfectly fine to do coke with her friends off our kitchen island. She also wrecked my lululemon leggings with her nail file because they're apparently too provocative to be worn anywhere outside of the bedroom. She's insane. Her boyfriend broke up with her after that incident and I think it was for the best, he could do so much better. She went extra crazy after that and kept texting me that she knows I'm sleeping with him and that I asked him to break up with her.  


So I moved out. I really didn't want to because I loved my apartment but I didn't want to put up with her anymore and I found an even better apartment with friends I can actually live with. 


Thanks for the advice with my first question, to be honest I was a bit surprised so many of the comments were blaming me but nothing I did made her happy anyways so whatever.

"[UPDATE] I [22F] found a hidden folder on my girlfriend's [22F] hard-drive with heaps of photos of her step-sister [26F]



Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl3fu/i_22f_found_a_hidden_folder_on_my_girlfriends_22f/?st=iqu768b8&amp;sh=f3d51f04


**EDIT** Thank you to everyone for such an outpouring of support, it means so much to me! My GF and I had a big talk last night and she is going to tell her parents. It's likely they will find out at some point anyway, and it isn't fair that my GF should feel uncomfortable with her own family. And to the people who are saying John must be gay, please think about what you're saying and how offensive it is. Yes, there have been instances where intensely homophobic people are hiding same-sex attraction. But they are in the minority. If I came to you saying my GF was black and her sister was marrying a KKK member, no one would be saying ""oh he just wants to be black"". Some people are just hateful. 


Hi guys, a few people hit me up for an update and I wanted to let you all know what ended up happening. Thanks for everyone’s support and advice, I wasn’t expecting so many people to comment and I really appreciate everyones feedback.  I’ve added some (fake) names here because there’s more people involved and I think it gets more confusing. 


From all the comments I got the sense that I was hugely overreacting. I’m an anxious person who can jump to the worst case scenario a lot of the times – it’s something I’m really trying to work on because I don’t like that side of myself. That’s really why I came here, to get another opinion before talking to my girlfriend. And you all slapped some sense into me, so thank you for that. 


So my girlfriend came over that night, and I decided to follow people’s advice and just talk to her about it honestly and be completely upfront. I said, “I wanted to surprise you by getting into Firefly so I went onto your hard drive to get it” and reddit my heart just broke, she was excited and wanted to put it right on so we could watch it together. I knew then that what I thought had happened didn’t – she obviously didn’t make the connection with the folder being hidden in her Firefly folders and was just keen to watch the show with me. That little reaction just made me feel so relieved – it’s hard to explain but I knew then that there was no way she was hiding this big secret and she obviously didn’t have any shame or embarrassment around the hidden folder, because she didn’t even remember that the folder was in there.


so I just said that I had accidently found the folder of her step sister (Lizzie), the one called “ugh”. I asked why she had made it. Her face just fell and she was quiet for a bit. And then she told me this whole story:


So I had noticed my GF had been quiet and a bit sad recently, but she’s been working a lot and I just assumed she was super tired. But no, like a few of you guessed she had had a big fight with Lizzie. 


A few weeks ago a high school friend (Gina) of my GF got in contact with her on facebook. Gina is fairly religious and goes to church a lot. Gina said she didn’t want to make waves in my GFs family, but wanted to let her know – the guy Lizzie is marrying (John) is well-known in the Christian community in our area for being involved in those gay-conversion workshops and seminars. Gina wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, and seemed to think maybe she had accepted John’s work out of some internalized homonegativity. 


My girlfriend (and I) did NOT know that John did stuff like that. I only knew that he was a therapist and that he went to church, and my girlfriend said he had only ever been introduced like that to her. She said she was pretty sure her parents didn’t know either, as they have always been loving and accepting of her and would be outraged over John’s line of work. She was worried that John had been lying to Lizzie as well, and contacted Lizzie to tell her what she had heard from Gina.


Obviously it didn’t go well. Lizzie was very defensive, and basically just kept telling my GF that John’s beliefs were his beliefs and Lizzie had no right to make any assumptions over it. It was clear Lizzie knew what John was doing and was completely find with it, and was hiding it through omission from her family.


My GF cried and cried through telling me this. As I said in my last post, Lizzie was such a hero to my GF and she loves her so much, so this acceptance is such a betrayal. I think that’s why she didn’t tell me when it first happened, and when she hid those files – she just didn’t’ want to have to deal with it, because Lizzie hurt her so much by not caring what John does for “therapy”. These workshops focus on telling gay kids/adults of how wrong and perverted they are, and basically force them back into the closet. They focus on scaring parents into cutting support off from their gay children and use all these horrible horrible tactics to basically force these people to hide their sexuality. 


So she said she just couldn’t stand having all these reminders of Lizzie scattered through her computer, so she ended up just putting them all into one folder and hiding it. I guess “ugh” meant “ugh I don’t want to deal with this right now”. 


We’re sort of at a loss to do now. I’m obviously just trying to give my girlfriend as much support as I can, because everything is her decision now. Lizzie doesn’t seem willing to see that what her fiancé has dedicated his life to is so painful for her sister. My GF doesn’t know whether to tell her parents. On one hand, it’s going to be horrible/painful/awkward as balls to have family dinners with this future brother-in-law who thinks that her and me are “defective”. And my GF is pretty sure both her parents (including her step-dad) would do what they can to protect her from John. On the other hand, she loves Lizzie so much and doesn’t want to force her away from her family. It’s not Lizzie’s profession, and John has never been outright nasty to my GF. 


So it’s still in motion, but I wanted to let you guys know what’s happened since my last post. I’m obviously relieved my GF doesn’t have feelings for Lizzie, but this is still heartbreaking in a different way. It’s horrible to see my GF so upset and I’m just trying to give her as much love and care as humanly possible. I’m excited for tonight because I borrowed a projector from my friend and am going to set it up so we can watch Firefly on the wall of my living room. I’m going to make us a big blanket fort and order pizza so we can snuggle and watch TV all night. 


Thank you all again, it means the world to me that you all took time out of your lives to offer advice to me.


**TL;DR:** My gf hid photos and texts of her step-sister because they are fighting and she didn’t want to look at them. Turns out step-sister is marrying a homophobe that works for a church performing those “gay conversion” workshops.

All told, my sister and I received about fifty-thousand dollars each, plus a few stocks and other investments worth about fifteen to twenty thousand dollars more, increasing over time with interest. My mother of course received more because she is his wife. She was really humble and ashamed as if she did something wrong, promising my sister and me that we would inherit everything when she's gone. I told her to keep her money and enjoy it as much as she can. My sister concurs.


Recently the lawyers handling everything have cut a check for each of us. My wife and I (we've been married eight years) discussed several weeks ago that we will just put the money in our retirement fund to combine with the one I get from my job as a teacher.


But my wife kind of bragged to her family that I had received an inheritance and that we were making our retirement more comfortable. We're also considering taking a few thousand dollars to go on a nice summer vacation with our two kids (two boys aged seven and four).


Her mother suggested that I use the money to help my wife's cousins and other family members fulfill their dream of opening a gourmet French restaurant. None of us are French but my wife's cousin is supposedly finishing culinary school and he says he will be the chef.


My wife's mother is really manipulative and has convinced my wife that our using my inheritance money to fund the family restaurant idea is the right thing to do, and that if my mother is unable to convince me to devote all or at least most of it to the restaurant idea, then my wife has the right to at least give them half (ie, twenty-five thousand dollars).


I do not like this idea at all, especially giving them all the money but even half of it. I asked my wife why don't they just borrow money from the bank, but it turns out none of them have very good credit. When I ask how they will ever pay me back, my wife's mother insists that I will be paid back by restaurant profits.


Personally I think it's all a stupid idea and doomed to failure, but my wife is now convinced that this is the best course of action and that if she fails to come through for her family, it is a sign of disloyalty.


I don't think my dad intended his money to be used to pay for some jackass idea that will most likely fail. None of these people know what they're doing, but at the same time I don't want to disappoint my wife.


When I offered my mother in law ten thousand dollars out of the fifty, she kind of turned up her nose at it like I was selfish and insulting her.


I really don't care what she thinks but I do care about what my wife thinks.


Just looking for advice on what to do, what compromises to make, just comments in general. Thank you Reddit.

**tl;dr**: My late father left me nearly fifty-thousand dollars in his will. My desire is to invest it for my retirement, while my wife feels that I should give the cash to her relatives so that they can open a restaurant"
"My [29F] mom [50sF] WILL NOT STOP offering my belongings to other people, then guilting me and insulting me when I say no. I'm getting really angry.


I got married last year, so I have all my wedding stuff in my attic (the one I have at my house with my husband, not my childhood house) and closet. Some of it I don't care about (extra favors, decorations, etc), some of it I do (my dress/veil/champagne flutes).

A few month ago, my cousin got engaged. She's a little snobby and would usually never accept used stuff, but that doesn't stop my mom from constantly offering. Keep in mind I payed for all of it myself.

My mom called me a couple weeks ago and said ""I told [cousin] she could have your card box, cake knife, and cake topper. Do you care? She said she wants it.""

I don't care about the card box or knife, but the cake topper was custom made for me. I told her she could have the first two, but in the future to please not offer my stuff to people without asking.

 She used to do this to me *all the time* as a kid. I'd come home to see my doll missing, and she'd be like ""oh, [other cousin] was here and she wanted it."" It pissed me off, to which she always called me a selfish only-child.

Anyway, a couple weeks after the card box thing, I mentioned I had a busy morning that Sunday, because I had planned to clean out all my closets and dressers. Saturday night, she called me and said ""I told [friend] you were cleaning tomorrow, and she wanted to know if you had any coats, so I told her you'd give her some."" I DID NOT mention I was throwing away anything, especially any coats. I told her no, which she guilt-tripped me about because her friend is poor, and I have so much, and I'm selfish. I gave her one I never really wore, but I told her this is the last time I'd put up with this shit and to cut it out.

Now, my aunt is staying with her from out of state for the week, and my aunt forgot to bring nice shoes. So, guess who is the same shoe-size as her? My aunt showed up to my place Saturday morning, telling me my mother said she could look through my shoes for a pair to wear to a party that night. I felt bad saying no to my aunts face, so I let her in.

Then, she informed me that my mother also told her I'd be taking her to the airport next week. I didn't answer.

Then **today** my cousin who is getting married told us she found a wedding dress. I was over my moms house having dinner, and she showed me the pictures she texted her. I remarked that her veil looked very similar to mine, and my mom goes ""yeah, I told her she could just have yours, but she said no.""

Finally I exploded. And I'm not proud, but I was swearing at her. I said ""what the *fuck* gives you the right to offer my wedding veil to her without asking me? Enough with this shit. I've had it. I will give you nothing. Ever.""

That veil was $500, and I was/am in love with it. It really pissed me off. My mom tried to play it off like ""oh please, I knew she wouldn't say yes anyway."" But that's not the fucking point. I left, and told her she could make herself look like a fool from now on by offering shit to people they can never have, and I no longer care.

Now she's trying to guilt-trip me about what a horrible selfish person I am, and I'm not having it. I don't care if I'm selfish. I wouldn't take someone else's things without asking, and I don't want people offering my things. Period. 

To top it off, a few hours later I get a text from my mom saying ""[Aunt] wants to borrow another pair of shoes for a party she has this weekend.""

I didn't answer. I'm literally seeing red. I want to wring her neck and never talk to her again. She's a good mom, I swear, and I never talk to her this way, but she's really been getting on my nerves lately by stepping all over my boundaries. There's other examples about boundaries, but this is the main thing that's driving me crazy today.

I need advice before I go completely mental.

"[UPDATE!] I [18F] am deathly allergic to my younger brother [5M] kitten. Think his Dad [40sM] is encouraging him to poison me.


Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sne8n/i_18f_am_deathly_allergic_to_my_younger_brother/

First off, thank you all for your responses, I took the time to read through each one of them and took everything on board.

So, Friday morning, I told my Mom what was going on before I headed off to school and told her that I really didn't want to get Tommy in trouble! She said we'd sit down and talk with him after school, the pair of us, and get to the bottom of this (And he'd be grounded and have his scooter taken away because he's not getting away with it)

So we sat down and talked with him, this is a summary of the conversation.

Mom: Have you been putting cat hair on your sisters bed?

T:... yeah...

Mom: That's very wrong, Tommy. Because -explanation of severe allergy-

Tommy looks kinda shocked at this point, I don't think he'd figured out that it could actually kill me, he kept looking at me and I was nodding in agreement with Mom.

T: Sorry deathlyallergies! Sorry! Dad said that if you were okay with a bit of cat hair, Shadow could come home, he said that was a good way for him to come back, I'm sorry!

Mom: What exactly did Dad say?

T: He said that deathlyallergies got sick from cat hair, but having little bits about would mean she got better at being around it and then Shadow could come home. Like my injections.

So since then, Mom and I have basically gone NC with Frank. Tommy went for his weekend there with the knowledge that he's grounded and that's been passed on.

When Mom asked Frank about what Tommy had said, he denied it, saying he explained allergies properly and that it sucked but that was the way it was etc etc. We don't believe him, but since it's the word of a 5y/o against that of a 40y/o pillar of community, there's nothing we can do about it.

Tommy came home yesterday evening, stripped off at the door, went straight to the bath and then came and gave me a hug once he was clean, apologising again for what he'd done. Of course I've forgiven him, he's a little kid who's been manipulated by a grown up, which sucks.

So now, hopefully, the issue has been put to rest. It sucks to know that Frank tried to do that to me (whether he thought he was helping or he was just being a jackass I guess we'll never know) but I've cut him out of my life and that's that I guess.

*Edit* As per other suggestions, I will be getting Tommy a little plush cat sometime soon for him to have at home! It's not his fault.

**TL;DR** Talked to Tommy, he confirmed that his Dad gave him the idea. Tommy's grounded and realises he was wrong, Mom &amp; I have gone NC with Frank (Bar needed contact from Mom about Tommy)"
"My [27F] friend [20F] ruined my hair! How do I gracefully handle this?


My friend of about one year is in beauty school right now. A good beauty school with a good reputation for turning out competent upscale salon quality stylists.

Said friend will not be one of those stylists, judging by what she did to me.

She told me she needed a hair model this week for class. I ~~have~~ had beautiful red hair down to the small of my back. I assumed this was why she wanted me to be her hair model. What I learned is that ""hair model"" basically means ""living mannequin"", not so much model.

She asked what she could do to my hair. I told her *exactly* what my usual stylist does, in technical and layperson terminology. She indicated that she understood me and would be doing the same thing, given, on a student level. The entire process should take approximately four hours, but would be free due to it being ""model week"". Okay, fair enough, I'm due to have my hair done anyways.

To save you all the excruciating read it would be, here's a list of what went wrong:

* colored my hair the wrong color. a completely different color than the swatch she showed me.

* cut off 6"" instead of the agreed upon 2"" and did so on a large enough section that the rest of my head had to be made to match.

* charged me $10 for the color, when I had been told it would be free. okay, $10 is NBD, but still.

At this point, we take a break for lunch. I was expecting to be done by this point in time. She says she just has ""a little bit more"" to do and then we will be done, but ""don't worry, I'm really quick at this part"". I didn't bring a lunch because I expected to be done, and buying a lunch out at a restaurant is not in my budget. She does not offer a lunch, nor does she skip hers to get this done faster. I stress to her the importance of finishing quickly as I have lots of stuff to still to that day and have to get back to my dog to take him outside. This was at 12:30pm. We then go back for ""a quick"" round 2.

* she highlights my hair far too many shades lighter than looks natural, and uses BLEACH to do so. I didn't consent to using bleach on my hair, I consented to using the natural coloring stuff the salon is known for.

* she chooses the longest method of applying highlights, knowing full well it is the most time consuming *and* knowing full well I needed to get out of there.

* she uses another product I told her *not* to use on my hair, as it would take an additional 7 minutes. Lied and said it was something else.

* Shampooed my hair FIVE times after highlights, because she ""used the wrong shampoo"" the first two times. Sprays water down my back, soaking my shirt, twice. Leaves me in the wash stall for 10 minutes without so much of a word as to where she's going. Then comes back and says ""I just had to ask my teacher something"". Teacher confesses that friend ran out of wash stall to cry that the color didn't turn out properly.

* Attempts to do ""long layers"" for the styling. Winds up cutting another 3-4"" off of my hair. I explicitly told her I wanted to keep enough length to put into a decent ponytail and bun. Now, I look like a Hanson brother according to my BF. She started tearing up and crying a little so I didn't feel like I could even begin to express how angry and sad I was about it.

* Dumps oil all over my head, then puts dry shampoo on to try to fix it, leaving me looking like a wet mop with baby powder.

Oh yeah, did I mention? This ""it'll be really quick!"" took SEVEN *more* hours. Every time I said anything about the time constraint or about how long it was taking, she'd complain about her feet or about how she was tired or hungry.


Suffice to say, I am furious and I am sad. My once beautiful long red hair now looks like a Barbie got attacked by a 4-year-old with scissors. Being a redhead and my gingerness was part of my identity, and having long flowing hair was one of the few things about my body that I actually liked. I should never have let her near it. I was trying to be a good friend and help her out. She destroyed my hair in return. It's not like I can go get it fixed by a professional because a) the length is already gone, b) I don't have the money for that, and c) I still see this friend every few weeks and she will be heartbroken if I change the hack job she did to me.

I hate my hair now.

"My [24F] boyfriend [30M] of 1 year just told me we haven't been ""exclusive""


[removed]"
"The fiance [30sM] of my best friend [29F] wants me [29F] to stop calling her the nickname I gave her. I don't know how to diplomatically tell him no.


So there's me [29F], my best friend [29F], and her fiance [30sM]. They just got engaged last week. I'm going to be her maid of honor. Yay!

Her fiance is fine. We're not BFFs or anything, but he's cool. He's kind of a socially awkward nerd, and it's hard to get him to open up without bringing up what he's most interested in (what he does for a living, whatever TV show he's watching) and then the conversation with him can get a little one-sided.

My best friend and I have been friends since we were 15. Five-ish years ago (before my best friend started dating her fiance), she and I watched The Wire together. We both now consider it our favorite show.

Anyway, after watching that show, I started calling her, 'D' as a nickname, because, well, her name starts with D, and also, there's a character we both liked who was also called 'D.' I almost exclusively call her by her nickname now. 
   
(WARNING. There's a spoiler for the Wire in the following paragraph, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't keep reading!)

I got this very unexpected message from her fiance last night on Facebook. He told me that now that he and D are getting married, he kindly requests that I stop calling her by the nickname I gave her, as it's ""not a very mature way of addressing her. I would hate to think you calling her that during your speech at our wedding."" He also went on to say that he never approved of that nickname anyway, because the character gets murdered in the show and he ""doesn't like that imagery associated with my future wife.""

I'm not the most diplomatic person, so I don't entirely know to respond. I'm not even entirely sure if I should say anything at all. There's, hahaha, also part of me that wants to send back, ""Sure, no problem, bro. I'll just start calling her Bodie instead. Or maybe Omar. Oh, I know, I'll start calling her Snoop! Snoop would be a *great* fit for her!"" A similar part of me wants to agree with him, and then during their wedding, just use her nickname constantly during my speech. And there's another (admittedly, angrier) part of me that wants to say, ""What? Are you kidding me? No. Request denied. Oh, and fuck you. Don't ever dictate to me how I should interact with my best friend."" 

There's also this weird...possessiveness associated with his wording the message. He never calls her by her name, just a lot of ""*my* future wife"" and ""*my* fiance."" My best friend is fiercely independent, and I know she wouldn't appreciate being talked about like that. So maybe I should forward the message on to her saying something like, ""Hey...your fiance just sent this to me and I don't really know what to make of it.""

EDIT FOR AN IMPORTANT DETAIL THAT I FORGOT TO ADD: My best friend and I are both bisexual, and we have made out in the past. Just made out. A good handful of times in high school (we were like, ""We need to practice for our future boyfriends!"" but now that we're older, we laugh about all that now and are like, ""Right. Yeah. 'Boyfriends.' Sure. Uh huh."") and, I dunno, four or five times in college (while drunk at parties). 

We had talked about dating each other, but, I dunno...we love each other, but I don't think we would ever be *in love* with each other. We're pretty different people, which is why I think we make such good friends, but not terribly good significant others. The last time we talked about being in a relationship was, like, I dunno, 8 years ago?

It's now only just occurring to me that maybe this has something to do with her fiance's unexpected message...

Any advice would be appreciative. Thanks, y'all.

**tl;dr**: My best friend's fiance has asked me to stop calling her a nickname I gave her before the two of them even started dating. I don't know how to kindly tell him to shove it.

UPDATE: Well! I just got off the phone with D. She called me, I started to answer like I usually do, (""'Sup, D?"") But then, remembering that maybe she doesn't want to be called that anymore, I just sort of awkwardly extended the 'D' sound into her full name (so I answered like, ""'Sup Deeeeeeeee[full name]?"")

She immediately said, ""[Fiance] told you to stop calling me D, didn't he?""

I said yes, and she exclaimed, ""What the fuck, I can't believe he actually fucking did that! Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later. And *don't* stop calling me D.""

""You got it, D.""

We said our goodbyes and she hung up. Soooooooo...I think *someone* mighta crossed a line...

UPDATE 2: I just tried to post an update, but it was immediately deleted because this post is still on the front page. Long story short, D's fiance crossed a line, they got into the most ridiculous fight, and she is at my place right now. Not entirely sure when (or if) she's going to go back home. I'll post a proper update as soon as this one is no longer on the front page."

"My (39f) friend (39f) of 20 years babysat for me. Her kid (10f) opened a bunch of brand new toys I had stashed away. I'm angry at my friends (lack of) reaction and can't get over it.


A few weeks ago,  my friend called and asked if her family of 4 could stay with us for a week,  or two.  They had to move from their current rental and didn't yet have another lined up. 

They stayed 9 days.  It was hectic,  but my home is large and we kind of agreed to keep our lives separate (meals,  watching TV,  etc). We have a massive basement that is pretty much an apartment.  Things went okay. 

As a thank you,  she offered to babysit for me while I had jury duty.  It was 2 days after they left.  She came over with her 2 kids and babysat my kids. 

When I got home,  the first thing I noticed was candy wrappers all over the lawn.  All the kids were playing outside.  The hose was laying in the driveway,  turned on. 

When I went in the house,  I was shocked to find a total mess.  Dishes piled in the sink.  Chip bags,  empty cookie packages,  pop cans... 

I went to the basement to grab a box she left here and I couldn't believe the state of things.  It looked like they took toy bins and just threw them in the air.  

I keep a cupboard of new toys in a closet in the basement - things for my kids,  or birthday parties,  or Christmas presents.  The closet/cupboard was open and every single toy was open/laying on the floor. 

I realized the candy wrappers outside were from a gingerbread kit I had in the closet.  Went outside and looked,  and sure enough,  the entire kit was laying across the lawn.  Empty frosting bags,  gum drops,  tootsie rolls... 

I came inside and asked all the kids who was responsible.  My kids (5f) ratted out the daughter (10f) of my friend.  She was playing on the computer and barely looked up to say,  ""I didn't know I wasn't supposed to."" 

I yelled for my friend and explained the situation.  She rolled her eyes and said,  ""Oh boy.  Do you want some money?"" 

My friends husband pulled up and beeped.  They all got up and left.  As she walked out,  my friend said,  ""do you want us to come back later and clean?"" 

I said not to bother. 

I haven't talked to her since.  I'm angry.  Every time it crosses my mind,  I get mad.  I'm unhappy with her reaction.  I'm unhappy that she didn't apologize,  or even really react.  

I'd guess there was about $200 worth of toys in there (monster high dolls,  a science kit with microscope,  some bead jewelry kits).  It isn't about the money,  but I feel like the quantity of toys matters. 

For what it's worth,  her family struggles financially and we do pretty okay.  I wouldn't even accept money from her.  I just felt like she thought I was being petty because we do okay financially. 

Lastly,  where the hell was she all day? How did all this happen under her nose? I'm pissed about that too.  She wasn't watching the kids. Plus,  she jokes that I'm rigid and a neat-freak all the time -  so how could she leave me such a mess? 

Should I just forget about it? Confront her? 

Tl;dr: my friends family stayed at my house for 9 days while searching for a new place.  As a thank you,  she volunteered to babysit my 2 kids while I had jury duty.  My house got destroyed,  every bit of junk food was eaten,  and my toy stash (unopened toys stashed away for birthdays,  christmas) was raided by her 10yo daughter.  

She rolled her eyes when I told her what happened.  I'm angry at her reaction.  I'm angry that my house got trashed.  I don't think she really watched the kids. Should I say something,  or let it go?

SUPER LONG EDIT:  a few things - for clarity,  a pipe burst at her house and the landlord wanted 3k to repair it.  She offered $1,500. He refused.  That's why they were homeless. 

She also just started a new job.  The night before babysitting,  her new work-issued cell phone was stolen from her cart at a grocery store. 

She cashed in her 401k to use as a down payment to buy a home.  However,  the bank refused her mortgage. So,  they were back to hunting for a rental.  Plus,  she has a deadline to return the 401k money. 

Considering all of this,  I'm thinking she probably spent all day on the phone,  trying to fix these things.  When I got home and said my 'extra toys'  were destroyed,  her reaction was probably just exhaustion. Like,  what more could go wrong? 

It wasn't until I posted this that I really reflected on what a good person she really is,  and how out of character this is for her.  She's just going through a hard time. 

I cant tell you how much I appreciate the shift in perspective.  I'll still tell her how upset I was,  but I'm not angry anymore.  Thanks,  reddit! "
"[Update]How do I [F25] tell my MIL [F60's] that I don't want to go to a religious retreat with her?


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sgolv/how_do_i_f25_tell_my_mil_f60s_that_i_dont_want_to/)

Well, my husband and I sat down with my MIL and told her the whole truth. I told her that I don't identify with the subject matter, and that I won't get anything out of the retreat so I won't be going, but that I would be willing to go to another retreat. I was honest with her about my beliefs (that they are not Christian) and I told her that I know how important her faith is to her life and I respect that, and I asked for respect in return and that I have other things in my life that take that importance. 

It went...poorly. She doesn't understand how I don't relate to the core material (The central idea being ""Every woman longs for three things: to be swept up into a romance, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to be the Beauty of the story."") I told her that I relate much more strongly to the ""male"" counterpoint to the retreat (Adventure! Battles! Beautiful damsels in distress!) and I also told her that I resent how focused both books are on a man and woman's heart being only these things and fitting perfectly together and only with each other (I have a gay brother, and she has a gay sister, talk about a slap in the face). My husband told her that he doesn't feel that the subject matter for the men fit him either, and that we feel like opposite genders in the eyes of this ministry. I cut down trees for a living, my husband writes and plays beautiful music and is the most impeccable host you've ever met. 

Anyways, I'm getting away from myself. My MIL was upset to our faces, and kept making us answer *why* we didn't feel that way, and then when we explained why again, she said that it's not all like that. When she got home, she called my husband and told him that she had no idea how ""manly"" I was, and expressed disappointment on him marrying a woman of no faith. He told her off, and now we aren't talking to them. I'm sure she'll get over it, but how exhausting. 

Tl;dr - My MIL thinks I'm manly for not wanting to be the damsel in distress. "
"[Update] I [20] think that my mother [50F] is trapped in a cult lead by her best friend [50F]


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4psqsl/i_20f_think_that_my_mother_50f_is_trapped_in_a/


I was hoping to have a good update, but crap just hit the fan. All this went down less than an hour ago.



My siblings were watching the new Netflix show Stranger Things when my mom walked in. She asked them what is was, then left the room. She came back and told them to leave. My brother saw a strange look in her eye so he stayed in the room. He looked away for a brief second and she dropkicked his X-Box, then slammed the TV to the floor and stomped on it. He grabbed her and held her down as the rest of us returned to the room, screaming. She was “praying” under her breath and ordering him to let go. He refused.



She was proud of what she did, probably thinking that she was saving our souls from demons or some such spiritual threat. She told me to leave. I refused, telling her I was worried about her hurting herself. Her leg was bleeding from the shattered glass of the TV. She broke her glasses trying to break free from my brother. My little sister called my dad, and he came home immediately. He grabbed my mom and led her to their room and told my brothers to stop screaming and swearing. We were all upset and afraid, not about our stuff being broken (it’s just stuff, who cares?) but because our mom had turned into a monster before our eyes.



My parents talked in their room for a while, then my dad came out and talked to me and my brothers. He was mad that they swore and says it’s unChristian and that he didn’t raise them that way. He thinks its disrespectful. He doesn’t condone what my mom did, but he also says some of our TV/movie/video game/music choices are not OK in his eyes either (sigh). He says his vision for his family didn’t come true and that he’s ""failed as a spiritual authority.” My brothers said they were swearing because they were scared and excited and meant no disrespect. My dad doesn’t swear at all and can’t understand this. I repeatedly tried to deescalate the rising tension. I repeatedly told my dad that not just my mom, but all of us needed counseling. We need a neutral third party with professional experience to sort through all these problems. He winked and said he was working on a plan to take care of my mom’s issues, but we kids need to learn to be more respectful (?!!). He says he's considering counseling, so I'm slightly relieved.



However, neither of my parents leave any room for disagreement with their kids. If we kids like or believe something that they consider unChristian, it’s unacceptable and they think less of us and treat us like less. I keep quiet so my relationships with them are not as strained as theirs with some of my siblings. I am the oldest child so I have to lead. It’s so hard. This is the worst day of my life so far.

"Me [26F] with my cousin [22/23F] who's been in my life for years. She's horrible. She's abusing her kids and has a warrant out for her. She's fleeing the state and family is helping her do it. Wondering if I should just tip off police and be done with it.


So a little background: When I was a child my paternal grandma adopted three girls from her very extended family. They were living with an abusive mom and grandma didn't want to see the girls go through the foster system and live with the state. She gave them beautiful lives and they grew up with every opportunity under the sun. The youngest two went off to educate themselves and live pretty decent lives. The oldest, Kristi, did not. 

Kristi was always the favorite and never given strict rules or boundaries. She dropped out of high school her freshman year and sold drugs for years. She'd take them as well and stash them in my grandma's house. She was trading/selling illegal weapons and prostit uting herself for drug money. Despite my grandma's best efforts to rehabilitate her, those efforts were in vain as the problems kept getting worse and worse. Eventually Kristi got knocked up at 17 by one of their state's most wanted for murde r and other charges and actually ended up having 3 kids with her.

She neglected and abused all three of those kids. She'd drug them for fun and they'd watch as her boyfriend beat her on numerous occasions. She turned their room into a BDSM dungeon and made them live in the large coat closet in the trailer my grandma bought for them to live in and men would come over every day. She'd tell her daughters that they can measure a true man by who beats them the best and would go long extended periods without feeding or changing them. Finally, their small town police station stepped in.

She was taken to jail and the kids were re-homed with grandma. Grandma was given the option to give the children up to the state but refused and instead signed a paper saying she'd act as their guardian and not allow their mother to see them again. She's in her 70's and in failing health and couldn't watch all three, so she actually gave Kristi's biological mom (the abusive one) the youngest to hold onto. She violates the paper and lets the kid's mom see them all the time and always goes to get her out of jail and let's her stay with them because she's scared to send her back to her house.

The enabling behavior is exhausting because those kids are terrified of being around their mother. Last I visited, the oldest boy who is now five clung to my leg and asked if I could take him to the shower for his bath because he was scared monsters would hit him from the dark hallway. I was so upset with that visit. I told my grandmother that by holding onto those kids and not allowing them to properly go through foster care and be adopted out that she was doing more harm than good, because by the time she inevitably passes and they are preteens or teenagers they'll go through hell with the state system. Of course, I went un-listened to. 

The visit was short because I didn't realize that it was that bad and left and was glad I didn't bring my own two children with me because it would've been one hell of a thing to explain. My family has given up on all of them. Kids included. I found out yesterday that Kristi fled the state because there's a warrant out for her drug selling and apparently suspected m urder. My grandma is covering for her and paid her bus fare to get her out of the state and plans to take the kids to see her.

Would it be wrong and terribly out of line for me to get involved and drop some kind of tip that this girl is avoiding her warrant and these kids are in danger and negligence? Funny enough the county CPS is involved but seemingly turning a huge blind eye to a lot. They live in a small town and the police can easily be bought.

I recognize that it might not be my place which is why I'm here asking for advice on what I should do. Any advice would be helpful and I'll try to respond to everything as best as I can.

**TLDR: My cousin is a horrible person. I call her my cousin, but she's my adopted aunt. She had her kids taken away and they live with someone who still lets her torment them. She has an active warrant out but is being helped with fleeing the state to avoid it. Enough is enough. Wondering if I should get involved just to get her ass thrown in a cell and inform the state that the kids are broken up and still in a negligent situation. Needing advice**"

[Previous post here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tnr0p/me_27f_with_my_fiance_28_m_of_2_years_together_6/)

So this is a fairly quick update, since it apparently just takes one good conversation to resolve something. 

I came home from a particularly busy day at work, the first of many for the next couple weeks. Fiance was in the living room working on his bike and there were a decent amount of dishes in the sink and a couple pans on the stove. I collapsed onto the couch and he came over to rub my feet while I told him about my day, which sort of naturally sparked the conversation that I knew we'd need to have but hadn't planned on having just yet. 

**Me:** Blah blah blah, work stuff.

**Him:** I'm sorry that work is stressful right now. Is there anything that I can do to help?

**Me:** Actually yeah. I miss you all day, and I love coming home to you because evening time has always been our time together, and I love that. But when you are home all day and you don't spend much time cleaning up after yourself, then I get home and have to cut into our time together while I tidy things up. 

**Him:** Yeah...

**Me:** I don't mind cleaning the house, but I don't think it's fair that I'm responsible for cleaning up a house that looks nothing like it did when I left it. It would be really helpful for me if you could have things cleaned up from your projects and the kitchen cleaned up from your meals before I get home, so that we can focus on each other. 

**Him:** Oh, yeah, I can take care of that. 

**Me:** I wouldn't even mind you leaving stuff out if you had a space away from the main living areas to work on things. Maybe your office or the garage or back yard?

**Him:** Yeah, I think that might make things easier on both of us, since I don't like putting everything away when I am in the middle of working on something. 

**Me:** Yeah, that's fair. I get that. 

**Him:** I'm actually not even sure if this will be an issue much longer. (Acquaintance of ours) told me that (local company) will be looking for a (his job title) and I have been planning to apply when the position becomes available. 

**Me:** Oh? That's great. 

**Him:** Yeah, I miss it sometimes. I saw a few other listings that interest me but I've been dragging my feet on them. 

**Me:** I didn't realize you were looking. I think that's great.

**Him:** Oh yeah? Well maybe I'll work on that tomorrow. 

Not verbatim, obviously, but that's along the lines of how the conversation went. I got to tell him how I was feeling and he was just as accommodating as I should've expected him to be. I think in my stress and frustration I worked the situation up in my head to be more dire than it was, and I think some miscommunication might've played a part. We'll see how he does picking up after himself moving forward and hopefully he'll get back into work soon and alleviate the issue altogether. 

Thank you so much for your advice from before, those of you who provided some. Sorry to that one person who really wanted me to call off the wedding - the date is still saved, but I'll PM you for sure when we get the ball rolling on that divorce I was promised. 

Td;dr: We talked, things are better. Thanks, reddit. "
"Brother's (23m) gf (21f) recently 'suggested' that my (19f) closeness with my brother is uncomfortable and maybe I should find a place for myself, I don't know what to do here

"My (29M) very rich GF (25F) of 8 months wants to pay for an expensive vacation for the both of us. I don't feel comfortable accepting.


Some relevant background info: I make a very good living myself and earn slightly over 6 figures and come from a basic middle class family. I live a comfortable life and manage my money wisely. My GF of 8 months comes from a very rich family (like 0.1% rich). Salary wise she makes less than half of what I make but receives an allowance from her family's business every month. She doesn't even touch her salary and says that it gets accumulated into her savings account. She lives off of her monthly allowance from her family business. Relationship wise we are very compatible so far. I really like her and she likes me. She told me about her family's wealth about 4 months into the relationship when she felt safe and comfortable with me. Up until now we split all our expenses/dates 50-50. 

Recently we talked about going on a vacation and we decided on Western Europe since I have never been there and I think vacations are good tests of the relationship, and help move the relationship forward. I can afford the trip on my own if we go the ""normal route"" where we book economy tickets to fly and look for Airbnb/hotel deals. She wants to fly first class and stay in 4-5 star hotels. The differences in the rates between Airbnb/lower end hotels vs. 4-5 star hotels is staggering to say the least (without even getting into the airfare). I told her that I simply could not afford that and she offered to pay for me. She said I could pay her what I would have spent on an economy class airfare ticket + hotels in my range and she will simply pay the difference. 

This makes me uncomfortable. As generous as her offer is I don't think I am at the stage of the relationship where I can accept such a huge gift from someone. The difference according to my calculations will be over 3k and could be as much as 5k once we actually book. That's simply too much for me to accept. I want to politely decline her offer and see if we can work out a compromise. 

tl:dr: My GF of 8 months wants to pay for an expensive vacation. I want to keep things more ""affordable"" for myself without relying on her. Not sure what do here. "

I'm back and here with some good news.
_____________________________________________________________________________

I'm going to start off by saying i was being an ass, a big gaping ass but i fixed the problem. For a few days after my post my girlfriend was ignoring me which is understandable, i decided to surprise her with something special.

but before that i had to deal with the whole Rose issue, because i didn't want it to ruin my relationship. i asked to meet and we did at a local coffee and she was more friendly than usual.

i told her that i don't want to continue this friendship and that it's become inappropriate. i told her i have a baby on the way and my girlfriend needs me right now.

she stopped me and told me to let her say what she nedded to and i can decide when she's done(decide?). she said she felt a connection between us unlike anything she ever felt before.

she said she knows i have a girlfriend but she feels like me and her would be a better fit. i told her no and that none of that would happen and that i came here to end this ""friendship"" before feelings got involved.

she started crying and told me i was breaking her heart (this was getting awkward) and to please not do this. i just told her not to contact me and walked away.

last i heard anything about her she requested a transfer to a different department. 

_____________________________________________________________________________

i told my girlfriend i ended the friendship and that she won't be a problem anymore. my girlfriend hugged me and smiled and thanked me for listening to her.

i apologized because i acted like an ass and she didn't deserve that at all so everything was good. the next day i took her out to dinner and we ate and spent some time together.

when we got home i proposed, she was very excited and we hugged for probably and hour. so now we are engaged and she's really happy right now, so happy that she immediately called her sisters to tell them.

but that's what happened these past few days and i feel better about all of this. and i will never do anything like this again.


   
**tl;dr**: i fixed the problem and stopped being friends with Rose she revealed she had feelings for me and wanted me to leave my girlfriend for her. i ended the friendship and proposed to my girlfriend."
"My dad (M61) found out something about my (M28) and my boyfriend’s (M24) sex lives, and I think it has changed the way he treats my boyfriend. Is there a problem here?


Okay reddit, this is a very weird situation that I find myself in. I’m not even entirely sure that there’s a problem at all, to be honest. My apologies in advance for what will probably be a fairly long post.

I have been with my boyfriend for three years and we have a wonderful relationship. He’s smart, funny, and beautiful – we’ve talked about getting married and I can see myself proposing to him in the next year. A few weeks ago we went out to our city’s Pride parade, and at one of the stands they were giving away rainbow stickers with various words written on them, e.g. gay, proud, but also funnier ones that said things like twink, bear, daddy and more. As a joke, I slapped a sticker that said ‘top’ on myself and one that said ‘bottom’ on him (for those of you not in the know, that’s gay slang for the giver and receiver of anal sex). It was funny, we both laughed because it’s true, and then we went on enjoying the parade – in the process completely forgetting about the stickers.

Anyway, after the parade my parents had invited the two of us over for a summer barbeque. I adore my boyfriend’s parents but my relationship with my own is somewhat strained. They’ve never been particularly religious but have put a lot of emphasis on tradition and are pretty white picket fence-y. My dad is a blue collar guy and my mom is a SAHM. Because I played a lot of sports they were blindsided when I came out as gay in university, and their reactions weren’t great. My mom cried a lot and said she wanted me to have grandkids. My dad was even more devastated, I think because in his eyes I had become less of a man despite the fact that nothing had actually changed. We stopped going fishing, camping and to car shows together like we had for years. It sucked, but I toughed it out and had school to focus on. Over the last five years or so my parents’ attitudes have improved and we’re now somewhere between cordial and friendly. 

I’m sure you’ve all figured out where this story is going. My dad picked us up from the train station (they live in the suburbs, the parade was downtown) and lo, we still have the stickers on. He must have spotted them right away because he was stiff, awkward and flustered for the whole ride. When we got out of the car I was able to subtly pull my boyfriend aside and remove the sticker. He was embarrassed and hoped my dad hasn’t seen. The dinner went fine after that, but since that day my dad’s behaviour has changed markedly. In only a few weeks there have already been several weird incidents:

1)	The day after my dad called me up and asked if I wanted to go on a fishing trip with him some time in the summer. I was shocked, since that literally has not happened since the day I came out seven years ago, but also pleased, and I said yes.

2)	My mom called me to ask if my boyfriend wanted to come to a Shakespearean play with her and my sisters. The play is a few hours’ drive away at a well-known theatre festival, so it would be a day trip. They do this trip once or twice a year, but have never invited any of my boyfriends or me before, and it's usually been a sort of 'girls' day' where they'll have a picnic, go shopping in town and stuff like that in addition to the play. I asked my mom why the invitation now and she said that my dad (!) had suggested it. My sisters and my boyfriend get along great and he loves Shakespeare so there’s no problem, but again, the fact that my dad suggested this has me shocked. It’s so out of character for him. My boyfriend was super excited and they’ve all booked their tickets. 

3)	This past weekend we saw my parents again at my nephew’s birthday party. The kids made a huge mess. My boyfriend, mom and sister were cleaning up but my dad got mad when I (and my BIL) wanted to go help. He wanted to sit on the lawn, drink beer, and talk about baseball. I told him that if we didn’t help it wasn’t fair, and he replied that we’re allowed to do guy stuff while they clean up. I pointed out that my boyfriend was helping and he said “Yeah, but that’s different” with no more explanation. I was mad and just got up and left my dad there, and my BIL followed a few minutes later. Apparently my dad’s still pissed that I wouldn’t be a lazy asshole with him.

Anyway, what do you make of what my dad’s doing? Am I totally crazy or has he started to treat my boyfriend like he’s my girlfriend now that he’s learned, accidentally, that he’s on the bottom in bed? I’m also confused because for a while his behaviour actually seemed to improve, inviting us both out to do activities we’d enjoy. But now in light of the last incident it seems more sinister. 
What should I do? Is this all in my head or just a coincidence? Is there a way for me to tell my dad to knock it off without him being able to deny that he’s doing anything differently? Should I tell him to stop at all, given that my boyfriend would actually prefer to clean up than talk about baseball and that I do want to have some bonding time with my dad?

TL;DR: My dad accidentally found out that I'm a top and my boyfriend's a bottom in our relationship. I think it's making him treat my boyfriend like my girlfriend. Am I crazy? How can I talk to my dad about this?

"I[28m] referred my girlfriend's[25f] friend[26f] for a high paying job, my girlfriend and her friends now hate me .


I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year now. A little background about myself and my girlfriend. I make significantly more than my girlfriend and her friends. I work in consulting and have a pretty good network. I am friends with people at all different all levels throughout multiple companies, and my word carries a good bit of weight. This doesn't mean I give handouts to anyone. 

If someone I know has a good work ethic, and I know would be a good fit for a job, than I'll refer them. If you are looking to just milk a company for money, than no. 

My girlfriend works as a tutor in a learning center she doesn't make much money, in fact most of her friends don't either. In particular I met her friend Jessica a couple months ago. One thing that I will say is she is pretty, a diasdvantaged minority, and also had a really friendly/warm personality, and currently she was working at the front desk of a gym, making $10 an hour. 

Over time getting to know her I realized that she was a good person, I asked her if she was looking for a new job she said she would be interested. I had a friend who worked as a talent director, and I referred Jessica to him.  She ended up getting the interview and shortly after getting a job. His company is looking to have a more diverse candidate pool, and she was a great pick for the team. 

Things were all good, her friends said that if a new position opens up that to look out for them too, my girlfriend as well basically said the same thing.  The problem happened was when Jessica started bragging about her salary, which was now more than 2x what she used to make. She started buying fancy things.

My girlfriend has gotten extremely angry with me saying that I got her random friend a job, but won't do it for her. The reality is that my girlfriend just does not have the personality to do the job that Jessica is doing. Not that her personality is wrong or bad, in fact I prefer my girlfriend's to Jessica's just different. Her friends too now are all jealous of Jessica, and have started spreading lies that I have a huge crush on her and it is really ruining my girlfriend and I's relationship. I am not sure what to do. 

I thought I was doing a nice thing helping her friend out but instead it has really backfired. I can't give people jobs and frankly the entitlement makes it that I don't want them to ever refer them to any of my friends. What should I do?

**Tl;Dr- I referred my girlfriend's friend to a good job, now there is a lot of anger towards me after the friend started boasting about her new salary. My girlfriend and her friends want me to give them jobs.**

"[Update]Our neighbor [50's-M] keeps complaining about music from our [20's] apartment. We live in artist's lofts, management took his side.


[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4nz28u/our_neighbor_50sm_keeps_complaining_about_music/)

So my husband and I went on a few week vacation, so our neighbor was out of our minds for a bit. We got back about a week ago and it has been living hell. He bangs on the shared wall at least a few times a day (much of the time when I'm just sitting in silence working on my computer, other times when we are watching tv or making dinner). We hung 3 pictures one afternoon (7 nails total into the wall, only two on the neighbor's wall), and he called the police on us. I went to talk to him to warn him that we would be hanging a few more paintings the next day, and he got irate with me. He threatened me and my husband, and he told us that we disturb the whole building with our noise, and that the woman above us is constantly pounding on her floor too. We know the woman above us, and have never heard pounding from her.

We haven't gotten any more complaints about my husband playing piano, but it has also been too hot for the neighbor to open his window, and I think those are correlated. We padded between the keyboard and the wall, and our neighbor on the other side said that she can't hear anything. 

I'm completely at a loss. This man has made our wonderful new apartment miserable, and I do not know what to do. I alerted management that he threatened us and that I am afraid to interact with him in the future (he was foaming at the mouth mad) and that I would be contacting the police if he threatened us again, but what else can we do? Management is not responding. 

TL;DR Shitty neighbor got shittier, thinks we are making noise when we aren't, threatened me. 

Edit to add to the DM's telling me I'm a horrible neighbor. The guy who lived in the unit before us was a woodworker and did carpentry projects in his apartment (with no complaints from the neighbor). I've never run power tools in the apt, so I could be worse, though I do understand how annoying typing is to someone in another room. "
"Me [32F] with my Mom[66F]. My born again christian mom is writing a book...I am NOT ok with this.


Ok..so the title doesn't even come close to summing up the issue I'm having with my mother at the moment. I apologize in advance if this becomes a wall of text. 

My parents divorced when I was really young and I lived predominantly with my mother (visitation with my dad every other weekend and 1-2 days during the week he would pick me up from school and we would have dinner). My mom was a ""functioning alcoholic"" but somehow always managed to keep custody of me. 

I suffered a lot at the hands of my mother. I was abused by her boyfriend, she had random people coming and going (only as an adult do I realize they were there to party i.e. drugs...which I had zero clue about). There were times I would have to call my dad to come get me, because I couldn't wake my mom up and I was hungry. To this day, I have no idea why I wasn't taken out of that house sooner...I suspect its because my mom was great at putting on a good face, smoothing things over, and had a killer lawyer. 

In 5th grade, I went to my dads for a weekend visit...and never wound up going home. My mom called him claiming she was ""sick"" and could he keep me for a while...like I was a pet he was pet sitting. My dad, of course, said yes and he took me to her house to get some of my clothes (I literally had the overnight bag I packed and that was it). He wanted to go inside first, and when he came out, he told me not to come in...that he would be out shortly. It was only years later that he told me she was in there, high on heroin, and that he didn't want me to see her like that. 

I spent that summer with my dad assuming I would go back to my moms when school started, but that never happened. I started the year at my dads...and on my birthday (end of September), she called me AT MY SCHOOL to wish me a happy birthday, claiming that the house was being fumigated and it would be ""just a little while longer"" until I came home. I never did. 

I actually never saw my mother again until my junior year of high school. She had quite literally disappeared. For those 6 years, no one knew if she was alive or dead..she lost her house, all of her possessions (some of which were antiques from her parents). I found out later she had pretty much pawned everything of value, and then everything else (including all of my things), were sold at auction or thrown out. My uncle went so far as to hire a private investigator to find her, with no luck. FINALLY, in 199 (my sophomore year), my cousin happened to be watching the news and they were doing a story on a building that was being torn down, and they were interviewing a homeless couple that lived in the building. Wouldn't you know...there was my mother. He called his mom (my aunt) and she called my dad, and my dad called my uncle, who called the PI (yeah...you following this so far??) and he got a copy of the news segment. 

There she was...drugs had completely ruined her, she was strung out, dirty, disheveled, and talking about how she was upset they were going to tear the building down because she lived there and that they had sex in the building. I shit you not. I realized there and then that the worry I had about her had been replaced with absolute anger. I hated her, I wanted her to know how much I hated her, so in my junior year when my aunt called me letting me know that my mother had reached out to her and wanted to see me, I jumped at the chance. 

I met with my mother (and my parents...my dad and my step mom) in the food court of the local mall. She was working at burger king and had just finished her shift. She started to cry, and told me she had ""made a list of all the things she had done wrong to me"" such as: not swimming with me when I asked, not taking my friend with us on a spring break trip, not buying me the tv I wanted.... nowhere in there were things like ""allowing random people to sleep in my bed"" or ""allowing her boyfriend to mollest me"" or the BIGGEST one (in my mind) ""selling custody of me to my dad for $1500"". I honestly didn't even read the rest of the list because it didn't matter...she clearly didn't realize what she had done to me, and I had zero interest in even telling her how much she hurt me... I just walked away. 

She wound up getting clean, finding Jesus, and rebuilt her life pretty well. She got a job as a behavioral health counselor (she got her bachelors years before she had me), and got a little apartment. I reached out to her, after hearing how well she was doing, when I was pregnant with my first son. I realize I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and wanted some type of closure. That contact sort of opened the door for a very fragile and tenuous relationship...but I tried. I figured if not for my sake, then for my sons. 

Our relationship has been up and down...I have very little patience for her and clearly harbor a lot of resentment, but I put it aside for my kids. She has been an amazing grandma, and she has stayed clean. I told her if she ever takes another sip of alcohol, I will take my kids and she will never see them again. Thats the level of tolerance I have for her. None. A lot of people have asked how I can put all of it behind me and forgive her...and truthfully, I don't know that I will ever forgive her fully...but it was such a long time ago, that it almost feels like it was someone elses life...so that helps. 

Fast forward to today, I get a call from my mother that she was written a book and that she wants to publish it! How exciting right?! Except for its a book that details EVERYTHING from my child hood. I asked her why she wouldn't tell me she was writing a book (because let's be honest, it takes a while to write a freaking book) and her response was that ""she didn't think it would bother me"". 

There are only a handful of people that know about what I went through as a kid...and those people know because I told them. I understand that she wanted to write a book because she thought it would help people, but she never took my thoughts into consideration once. She didn't even use a pseudonym...and we share the same last name. If this book gets published, and becomes widely publicized, people will know that its my mom and that its me in the book. 

I'm so angry at her for this... and I feel like I have a right to be. Or not? I guess thats why I'm here. Am I wrong to feel betrayed by this? Should she have asked me before writing it? She wont even let me read a copy of the book before its published, and that scares me. I really don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated. 
   
**tl;dr**: My mom did a lot of terrible things in my childhood, found Jesus, and is now writing a book. "

"Me [26 M] with my sisters[33F and 35F] went on vacation together and they are so pissed off at me that they won't speak to me.


I recently went on a beach vacation trip with my two older sisters and their families.  They both have husbands and one has 3 kids and one has 4 kids.  I am single.  The kids range in age from 3-13.

During the trip, I stayed in the condo with my sister who has 3 kids.  Each condo was a two-bedroom set-up with bunk beds in the smaller bedroom.  I happily bunked in there with my nieces and nephews.  We had a blast and I loved seeing everyone and their families since we are all spread out over the country and don't spend much time together.  

Here is the sticky part.  There was a nice girl (21F) that was flirting we me at the pool and beach while we were there.  She was vacationing with her parents.  After a while, we ended up texting with each other late one night and decided to sneak out of our respective units and spend a little time together.  I would never bring her to the room with the kids in it and she would never bring me in where her parents were at.  We were very discreet.  After the 3rd night in a row of sneaking out for a few hours, one of the kids apparently heard me leave and went and told my brother in law that I was gone.  When I returned, my sister and her husband went nuts on me.  They were waiting up in the living room for me and gave me a huge lecture when I got back.  

I could not understand what the issue was.  Here are two adults spending a bit of time together and we were being very sensitive to my nieces and nephews and her family as well.  They told me that I should save that stuff for when I get home.  

I don't get it, was I wrong?



   
**tl;dr**: BIL and Sister tried to prevent me from spending a few hours alone with a girl I met on vacation!"
"[UPDATE] Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 5 years, she told me she likes someone else but wants the option to come back if things don't work


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4jo5hj/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_5_years_she/)

Ok, guys. Finally I have an update.
First of all, thank you again for the support.

After the original post, I was afraid of losing her.
I gave her that ultimatum but then I tried with all my efforts to be romantic and sweet and tried to make her love me again.

While doing my best she went on with her requests.
She said she wanted to tell Victor what were her feelings for him and admitted the reason was to find out if he was in love with her too. (But she admitted only after I ""disclosed"" this reason to her)

After a while, my efforts gave some results.
She started saying that she was again in love with me, that she really liked how much I was romantic etccc. and started trying to minimize what she originally told me. (Victor is not the problem, I've always loved you etc .... )

That's when I finally realised how she was treating me!
The fear of losing her was gone and I started thinking how selfish were her requests and how I could not trust her anymore.

We went on with our relationship for a while but my feeling were drastically changed. I started feeling inadequate when I was with her due to my trust issue.

So 2 days ago I asked her out to finally end this relationship.
We met and she went on saying that she was sad, that she loved me but that I took her for granted too many times and that she wanted that pause to find out if I was the right one.

The fact that she wanted a pause was in her opinion a ""great act of love"" and she told me that after that period, if she have decided to come back, it would've been FOREVER !

I told her that she did not know what she was talking about and asked if she had considered the option of me not wanting her back after the pause : she said NO.
(Speaking about taking people for granted ?!?)

So I broke up with her. She was in tears and when I was ready to leave she started saying things like ""can we met tomorrow?"" ""please, after the finals at least"".

Well, I think this is the end.
I'm feeling pretty well I think.
I miss her a bit but I think it's normal.

Thank you again for the support.
And if you are o will be in my situation, trust me, end it as soon as possible.
Don't do the same mistakes I made.

TL;DR : At first I tried to make her love me again. Then I realised how selfish she has been. We broke up and she probably does not know what she has done.

"My [16F] stepbrother [19M] has been drawing me.


I lived alone with my mum since she I was eight and her and my dad split up. My dad got married and has had two younger children with his wife. His wife has an older son from a past relationship who lives with her and my dad. I moved in with my dad at the start of the year because my mum lost her job and had to move out and live in her friends one bedroom apartment which doesn’t have room for me. 

Toby [pseudonym - idk if he is on reddit] does lifelike sketches of people which are pretty amazing. He gets commissions to draw people, celebrities and characters for people online for up to $150.

He is quite shy and reserved so we don’t talk much. I tend to give him a fair bit of space because we don’t have much in common and he has a weird vibe. A while ago he was showing me some of his drawings and asked if he could draw me. He just drew my head and shoulders but it was very accurate.

Yesturday I was telling my friend about Toby's drawings. She asked me snapchat her a photo of his drawing of me. Toby has a tone of sketchbooks but I remembered the one he drew me in was red so I looked through that book. The red book I looked through was almost empty and didn’t have the sketch I was looking for in it so I looked around his room and found a second red book under his bed. 

The book I found was full of sketches of just me. Some of just my face to my shoulders but some of me in just undies and there were several pages of me without any clothes on. There were also a few pictures of me in very sexual positions. All together there were at least 50 drawings of me. 

The sketches of my body were scarily accurate - down to two freckles I have on my chest and a scar I have on the top of the back of my thigh. I don’t really wear skimpy clothes and I don’t think he has every seen me not fully dressed. I don’t know how he would know about those details and I am scared he has been watching me get dressed or something. 

I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want to create any drama because things aren’t great in my family atm. I don’t think my dads wife really wanted me to move in with them which has caused some tension and I don’t want to give her a reason to dislike me. I am scared she would side with her son as I am a outsider in their house. I am not particularly close with my dad either, I feel like he is doing me a massive favour by letting me stay with them [they are struggling financially and I am an extra burden on them] so I don’t want to make it difficult for him. I also think he would side with Toby because he knows him better than he knows me and they are pretty close. 

Knowing about the pictures has put me really on edge. I haven’t had to deal with this sort of this before and I have no idea how to handle this. I was thinking of talking to him myself but I feel too embarrassed and I am scared about how he would react. I also don’t feel very safe around him right now so I think I need to do something.

I am completely freaked out and could really use any advice on how to handle this without causing any drama or giving my dad and his wife a reason to dislike me. Is this something I can let slide and if not what do I do?


   
**tl;dr**: Found my stepbrothers sketch book full of drawings of me including some nude and sexual sketches. Creeped out and not sure what to do."
"I [26/f] found my boyfriend's [29/m] diary. I didn't read it but his reaction to me finding it makes me think I should ask more questions.


My boyfriend, Luke, and I have been together 4 years and have just moved to a new place together. We have a pretty typical relationship and I really have no complaints. He’s never blown up on me and I’ve never had a reason to suspect anything. This recent situation has started to concern me though….
 

Like I said above, we recently (last week) moved to a new place so a lot of things are in boxes and haven’t been put away. I took Wednesday, Thursday, and today off of work to hopefully finish up the remaining boxes. Yesterday, I was going through a box when I found a book that was Luke’s. I scanned the first page and realized it was a journal because it had a February 2016 date at the top. I did not read anything else.  I used to have a journal that I would write in and I know I would have been upset if someone went through it. I’ll admit I was curious but I still didn’t read anything. I took it to the bedroom and put it on his nightstand so he could store it where he wants. I didn’t think he’d have the reaction he did….

 
When he got home last night and realized the journal was on the nightstand he immediately accused me of reading it. I explained that I did not read it. He didn’t believe me. He began yelling and ranting that he doesn’t “mean any of it,” that I “shouldn’t let it affect the relationship,” he “isn’t like that anymore,” “it was a one-time thing,” and he “really does love me.” I just kind of looked at him. He waited for a response but I didn’t have anything to say. Truthfully, I wanted him to keep ranting just to get a better feel of what was in it. We stared at each other for what felt like minutes when I said “I honestly didn’t read through it but it seems like there are things in there I should know about based on your reaction.” At that point, I think he believed me just from my expression. I felt like I looked pale.
 

When he realized that I really didn’t look through it, he tried to back track and say they are just fabricated stories/creative writing that he writes sometimes. I’ve never known Luke to enjoy writing. This is something that he’s never shared with me. He’s also not a “creative” type of guy. He’s more of a “believer of facts.” His words when we first met. I told him that he seemed really emotional over it and I’d like to know more about this hobby since he’s never shared it with me. I told him he doesn’t have to show it to me just give me an example of what he writes. He refused. I dropped it but the rant still weighed on my mind all night. This morning, I noticed the journal was gone. I assumed he would have hidden it so it didn’t surprise me. I continued with unpacking boxes when I went to store some stuff in our new office when I came across the diary AGAIN. I left it in its hiding place and didn’t touch it.
 

 
So, is this something I should be concerned about? I completely understand privacy when it comes to journals/diaries but his blowup and rant really weirded me out. I’ve never seen that before. He refuses to give me any idea of what’s in the journal. I’m not a big writer but I did have a journal once. I can’t say I would ever use the phrases “don’t let it affect our relationship” and “I’m not like that anymore” if someone ever found it though.
 

TLDR: I found my boyfriends diary but didn't read it. He didn't believe me at first and went on this rant. Some of what he said concerned me and now I'm not sure what to think about this diary. "

"I (30F) like it rough. But I don't like it rough outside the bedroom and my boyfriend (25M) doesn't seem to get that and it's pissing me off.


We have been together a year.

Ok so sorry if this is TMI but I like it rough in bed. Hair pulling, spanking, choking, grabbing my face hard, even slaps in the face (not super hard).

My boyfriend is on board with this and we get into it and it's great. Lately though he's been being rough outside of the bedroom and I've asked him to stop and he is surprised and gets all hurt and offended being like ""what? I thought you like that?""

Like the other day we were watching a movie in bed just hanging out and he grabbed my pony tail and started to shove it down near his crotch and I recoiled immediately and was like ""get the fuck off me"" and he was like ""what??? I thought you liked that?"" And was really surprised and hurt. It made me feel like a piece of meat or something I don't know I really didn't like it, although I probably would have been down with it if we were already doing something sexual not just out of the blue while I'm watching the Dark Knight Rises and eating MnM's.

Then he was really quiet and hurt saying ""sorry I didn't know you'd be so upset by that"" and I tried to reassure him but I was also pretty irritated.

Another example we were kissing in public and he moved his hand up to my face and slapped me twice relatively hard. I was like ""can you not do that in public are you serious?"" And he was like ""but you like it!!"" And the people we were with look kinda weirded out and I was embarrassed. We spent another few hours with the people and didn't really talk about it again as the day moved on normally maybe I should have brought it up again.

Even just in general playing around he's super rough. I told him he doesn't know his own strength but he doesn't seem to get it. We were playing around and wrestling a bit the other day and slapped my leg so hard it was really painful and also grabbed me so tight I have a few bruises on my arm.

Should I be worried about this, is it concerning? Or are the lines too blurry for him that he genuinely doesn't get what's acceptable and what's not?

TLDR: I like it rough in the bedroom, my boyfriend seems to think I therefore find all pain pleasurable all the time and it's annoying me."

"I [21F] have a ""friend"" [23M] who doesn't know boundaries and is mad I have a boyfriend [22M].


I've known this friend for about 10 years know.  We went to the same school since middle school, his mother was one of my teachers, we essentially grew up together. We used to be fairly close and fell off about 7 years ago.  In December of last year he invited me to coffee to catch up. We had a splendid time talking about music, movies, the ways our lives have changed, etc.  I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years now. We have lived together for 1 year and are very serious about one another. Everyone who grew up around and with us knows this, and knows we are together. 

About a month after we met up for coffee he offered to let me hang at his house after spending time with my other friend delivering her baby (it was a 15 hour delivery and I was in the room with her the entire time). I told my boyfriend where I would be and accepted his offer. It was a regular encounter with any friend. We watched cartoons and movies and I went to leave. When I left and gave him a simple hug he groped my butt. I freaked out on him and he apologized. 

I thought it would end there. About 3 months ago he messaged me and professed his love to me.  He told me he believes I'm the person he is supposed to marry and have children with.  I have never dated this man. I have never given him any romantic indications. I have stood very firm in my love and monogamous relationship with my boyfriend. Heck, they were even friends growing up. They've known each other longer than I've known either of them!

He frequently messages me to tell me I am his meant-to-be, then he will go on about how I am just words on a screen to him and I am not able to be his friend. He even goes as far to insult me on my public forum for all to see. 

I am quite close with his mother and truly care for him. However I'm not sure what my next move is. I'm not it trying to be naive. I just don't know where to go from here. 

Tldr; friend of a decade professes love then insults me for no reason. I am VERY faithful and steady with my bf."
"My wife [32F] is absolutely DEVASTATED that our daughter [4F] says she loves her aunt [34F] more than her own mother, and I [29M] am at a loss as to what to do


My wife and I have been married for six years. We have an almost- five year old daughter. I am an only child myself, but my wife is the middle child, with an older sister and a younger brother [29].


When our child was a baby and toddler, my wife stayed home with her and we all just lived on my income as an architect. I have an office downtown, but the company I work for generally lets me work at home, and I go to the downtown office one a week, twice at the most. 


When our daughter entered kindergarten early, my wife got a job as a substitute teacher (her degree is in history), and has a deal with the district where in she is pretty much guaranteed to have an assignment only once a week, every Thursday. When she is home, she takes care of our daughter and also works on paintings, which she sells on Etsy. She uses the money she earns teaching to buy her art supplies. When my wife is with our daughter she usually takes her to the park, on walks, to the library, on playdates. Occasionally when I can spare the time during the day, I accompany them for a while.


My wife's sister, who is unmarried and lives alone in an apartment about fifteen minutes away by car, offered to come over and watch our daughter on Thursdays. While it would seem unnecessary, since I am at home all the time practically, my work is actually very involved and requires all of my concentration, and when I'm working at home, it's behind a closed home-office door.


Typically what will happen is that my wife has to leave for her own assignment much earlier than when our daughter leaves for school, so my wife's sister comes over early in the morning even though I'm around and could drop our daughter off at school if needed.


My wife's sister and I generally get daughter dressed, make breakfast, and my wife's sister then takes daughter to school. My daughter gets out of kindergarten around lunchtime, so my wife's sister always just comes back to our house to make lunch for everyone. She will then pick daughter up from school and we all eat together. She will then play with daughter and hang out with her until three or four o'clock in the afternoon, at which time my wife comes home.


This happens one time per week.


Occasionally, during the two or three hour window between lunch and my wife coming home, my sister in law will take daughter to the mall or out for ice cream.


Three nights ago my wife and I were telling our daughter to finish her vegetables at dinner, and she was being very pouty about it. My wife insisted that she finish her asparagus or else she didn't deserve dessert.


At that point our daughter said, ""I hate vegetables why do I have to eat them? I love Auntie [name] better; she isn't mean like you.""


I judged her statement to be the childish and somewhat manipulative outburst for what it was, but my wife just acted so strangely about it.


She just got up from the table, asked me to make sure our daughter finished her food, and went to our bedroom and shut the door. I didn't think too much about it at the moment, but fifteen minutes later I went to the bedroom to check on my wife and I could tell she had been crying.


I've asked her about it and she says she's okay. I told her that our kid is just being a bratty kid and that she's trying to do the kid thing and manipulate us, maybe even unknowingly so.


But I can tell my wife actually is terrified that our daughter loves her aunt more than her.  


My wife then said she doesn't want to be a substitute teacher anymore and doesn't want her sister coming over. Prior to this incident, my wife always said how much she enjoyed ""teacher Thursday"" because she loved making a difference in the classroom, loved speaking to a class, and all that.


When I mentioned in an offhand way that her sister would probably be disappointed (but that I also went along with her decision to quit teaching if that's what she really wants), my wife said something like, ""Who cares what she thinks? Why do you care?""


Then she said her sister was stealing her family, and said something that makes me upset even now:


""She's trying to steal you, too, are you blind? Do you mind if she steals you? Have you * * * *ed her? You * * * *ed her didn't you? Is she better?"" 


I tried REALLY hard not to get furious at such a suggestion but I was really hurt. I was so insulted that I haven't dignified that accusation with a response to her (FYI I DIDN'T **** my sister in law), and just think that's she's upset because our daughter said she loves her aunt more than her mom.


My wife's been really sad the last couple of days. I suggested she go see a therapist (my insurance covers it) but she insists everything is okay. I can tell she's sad.


What can I do here? What do I tell her?


Is there any explanation for her behavior?


Just have no idea where any of this is coming from.

"My dad [51] passed away last year. We've discovered a box of unopened first generation Pokemon cards he stored away. My sister [28] is pregnant with her first child and the family [mum, 51/me 30F] is torn about what to do.


My mum and dad owned a shop in the UK selling collectables from 1998-2002ish. We used to sell Pokemon cards, Beanie Babies etc. It was how I spent every weekend as a teen. 

My dad passed away last year and when we were in the loft last week getting bits down for my sister's impending birth (her first child, mum's first grandchild) we found the box of unopened booster cards along with some starter sets. Dad died before my sister got pregnant, he never had any grandchildren. These are the first sets that were ever released. 

My sister thinks we should sell them (not even sure of what they're worth to be honest) but mum thinks we should pass them down the generations as they hold a lot of sentimental value. 

I see both sides. If we could get a few hundred we could spend the money on a headstone etc for dad. If we keep them, then my nephew gets something that means a lot to our family. 

It's causing a bit of tension between us all, as obviously it's an emotive subject. Any ideas on how to get this resolved? 

Tl;dr
Dad died last year. Sister got pregnant a few months later. Dad stored away a box of first generation unopened Pokemon cards. Mum wants to pass them to her grandchild, sister wants to sell them to pay for dad's funeral. 

**ETA: thanks for all your comments and suggestions, I am reading them. Just to reiterate, the cards are unopened, in their original shop display box which is itself vacuum wrapped.**

**A bit of background, dad had always been one for strategy games, so before the craze really hit the UK he bought a few boxes to see if they would sell. They were slow burners so put one back in storage to save shop space. He must have forgotten about them, the craze hit, the shop closed, the old box discovered and stored with other valuable items, then he passed away.**

"Today is my husbands (m/28) birthday. I'm not speaking to him due to an event at the weekend. Should I (f/28) get over it for this one day?


My husband and I have been married for two years, and for two years our marriage has been marred with his drinking. We have a great relationship except the drinking. He is incapable of going for dinner, going to a family event, or doing anything that everyone else remains relatively sober at, without getting incredibly drunk. 

He is not a big big drinker, but after a couple of drinks his eyes glaze over and he acts like a drunken idiot and there's no speaking to him. I think this is because he's a very petite man and drink goes straight to his head. Usually I'm left to hoist him home. The first year of our marriage the big thing when he gout drunk when he was out without me- such as at a bar for a friend's birthday - was to end up at the casino and he'd always always come home a few $100 down.

I managed to stop this by generally avoiding drinking situations, always trying to be with him when he was out at drinking events we couldn't say no to so I could get him home without him ending up at the casino, and finally only going out with cash when he did go out so he had a finite amount of money to spend. 

On Saturday, it was his best friends bachelor party. Of course I didn't want to tag along with him, but he assured me he was a new man and never, ever would he dream of going to the casino. Cue 2am and I get a phone call. It was my husband on the phone very drunk, telling me he had no money left because he was at the casino and spent all his money and couldn't pay for the taxi home. He self-excluded himself from the casino last year, but pretended to be his brother when he went to the reception desk. I went and got him and he passed out drunk on the porch.

I'm sick  of his drinking, and I think I've reached the point of where I can't be with him because he's promised more times than I've had hot dinners that he's going to change and only have a couple of drinks instead of getting so drunk we can't even go for dinner without him getting ridiculously drunk. That was Saturday, this is now Tuesday, his birthday. I have barley spoke to him since Tuesday. He knows I've got nothing to say to him as I sound like a broken down record player with the same argument 70% of our Sunday mornings with how drunk he got the night before. I've reached my limit. 

However, it's his birthday today. Should I get over this and, for the simple fact he's my husband, give him a good day and go back to deciding if I am completely sure I want to break up with him tomorrow? I love my husband, but I can't go on with his drinking, but I feel like utter crap I'm ignoring his birthday. What should I do reddit? 

TL;DR; Three days ago, husband and I had a huge argument about his drinking. We're still not talking but today is his birthday, what do I do?"
