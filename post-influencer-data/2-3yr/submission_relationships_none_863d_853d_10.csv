"UPDATE: I [24F] need to tell a good friend [24F] that she smells


[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4rmsqm/i_24f_need_to_tell_a_good_friend_24f_that_she/)

It's been a while since I asked for advice on telling my friend she had a strong body odor. It didn't get a lot of attention and it was a good result so I forgot about it. I believe I called her the night I posted and pretty much told her what I said I was going to tell her. I let her know that I really wanted her to get the job and then asked her if she knew she smelled (in a more tactful way - can't remember the exact words). She said she did know and the conversation went from there. She didn't give me the exact reason why and I didn't ask. I mentioned that since our work requires a uniform (I wear mine a few times before washing because it's an office job and I don't sweat), she should be washing hers often if she got the job. She was thankful that I brought it up with her. I followed up with talking about the job and giving her other advice about applying.


She actually did end up getting the job with me (yay!) and has become more hygienic. She's still not the cleanest but she doesn't smell like she used to and her car/room don't have the same heavy odor. To be honest, I forgot for a while that we even talked about this and almost forgot that this was even an issue before. I don't think she really remembers, either. It was a fairly easy conversation once I told her and it didn't change anything about our friendship. I wish I had told her sooner, but I'm glad I did tell her.

Kind of a boring update, but a good one. :)

  **tl;dr**: Told a friend a while ago that she smelled. She appreciated my honesty, we are still friends and she got the job!"
"[UPDATE] I [27F] just found out that my teammate [24M] plagiarized parts of our group 'thesis' paper for graduation. I'm furious. What to do?


Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69v77f/i_27f_just_found_out_that_my_teammate_24m/

Hey,

My sincere thanks to everyone who replied to my original post with suggestions. I read every comment, though I didn't have the time to respond individually. Here's the update.

About an hour after I posted on this sub asking for advice, I did the following 3 things:

1. Sent an email to the entire group, basically saying, ""Hey, this is what I've found, I don't want to accuse anyone of intentional plagiarism, but the school is certainly going to interpret it as such. I need EVERYONE to double-check their sections and confirm to me that they either have no issues with their citations, or that they are working to fix their citations.""

2. Reached out to the professor requesting an urgent phone call.

3. Spent the entire night looking through the entire paper. And guess what I found. Yep, *another person in our group did the same thing with her section.* It was actually even worse than what Guy #1 did, because she would copy/paste information from the same source for 3 or 4 sentences in a row, and then she would only add the footnote at the end of the very last sentence in the paragraph.

The next morning (Monday), 2 things happened:

1. Only one person in the group (the 4th person) replied to my email. He confirmed that he did not have any issues with citation in his parts, and volunteered to help me look through the entire paper and check citations against original sources.

2. Our advisor and I had a phone conversation. She was surprisingly accommodating about the whole thing. She said that since I was voluntarily bringing it to her attention before the paper was due, she would be willing to give us some leeway. She gave us a 12-hour extension for submitting the paper, and she promised that after she runs the paper through a plagiarism detection software, if she does spot anything that is suspect of plagiarism, she would discuss it with our team FIRST before taking anything to the academic board or whatever it's called.

Guy #4 and I spent all of Monday going through the paper again and pulling every single source that every single person had cited, looking at the exact page numbers in the PDFs and making sure that citations were done correctly. It was an absolutely exhausting, draining, miserable process. Guy #1 and Girl #2 were probably dead or something during this entire time, because we didn't hear a peep from them. We submitted the paper by the extended deadline, and I think we're good to go, even though I wish Guy #1 and Girl #2 had been penalized in some way because I worked so fucking hard to cover their asses.

A couple of thoughts:

1. Don't believe anyone who says group projects are a taste of the real world. They are not. I've been working professionally for the last 6 years, and I can tell you, I have never worked with a single person - even government employees - who has been as incompetent, lazy and just a plain dimwitted fucknut as the people I've encountered in grad school.

2. We messed up long before this, by not finishing our paper sooner. Honestly, for me, I was the only person in the group with a full-time job outside of this full-time masters program, so I've been extremely busy, but I know it's not a good enough excuse for procrastinating. I guess I just never imagined that grad students would need someone to educate them about what constitutes plagiarism. 

3. Yes, pulling something directly from a source without using quotation marks, even if you have a footnote, is plagiarism -- our advisor confirmed.

4. Don't do group projects! Period! I had the option to do a solo thesis and I chose to go the capstone group project route, because our program heavily discouraged the solo thesis option. Look where it got me!
  
Thanks everyone. Lesson learned. Never talking to these fuckers again.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We got an extension from our advisor to double-check and rework the thesis/capstone. We submitted it and now we should be good to go for graduation.

"My [28M] brother [25M] used my bank account in his fraud operations. Got busted and took my freedom away in my country. How to convince parents that I'm not going to forgive him?


I'm from somewhere in Asia. Very traditional close families, everything is everyone's business, all of that. About 5 years ago I came to somewhere in Europe to study. The plan was to study for 3 years and come back. During this time, I had a bank account in my home country which I wasn't using. It didn't have much money in it (like equal to $30) so I had totally forgotten about it. My brother however decided to use this bank account as the base of operation for a fraud business. He was scamming people, getting money into this account, buying bitcoins with the money, etc...

Like most people who do these things, he was caught. Except that the bank account was in my name. He had covered himself well so everything was blamed on me. I ended up needing to hire a lawyer and in the end I was charged with corruption and fraud. Obviously I have not come back to face the charges and I probably can't come back to my country for a very long time, if ever.

This changed everything about my life. All my plans ruined, all my life changed, I even lost my fiancé because her family would no longer allow her to marry me after this. My grandfather died and I couldn't see him one last time or go to his funeral. Many other things...

Now about 3 years have passed and I'm still not talking to my brother. I have no plans to ever talk to him. My parents keep pressuring me to forgive him and accept money from him so that we can be a family again. My brother has offered to split the money he stole with me which I do not want. This pressure is constant and ever increasing with time, as if it's now my responsibility to forgive him just because time has passed.

How do I convince my parents to leave me alone, and get them to understand that forgiveness isn't forthcoming for a very long time, maybe ever?

  ---

My wife and I have been married for 2 years and together for 5. We have 2 daughters together. I really need some help because she makes me so freaking angry. I've tolerated this, but now she's gotten fired because she's always late to work.  

My wife has this tendency to leave everything to the last minute. Cooking the kids dinner is an example. She keeps telling them that she'll do it when she's ready. They normally have to wait for me to get home to cook them something. On the weekend if I ask her to go grocery shopping. She'll leave it until 7 pm, and then there's this mad rush to go get food or other things we need. I drive the kids to my MIL in the morning for her to watch them while we're at work. She sits at home and she's always over an hour late to work. She does not take the trash out when it's full and she'll wait for me to do it. Just this past week, I took the kids to the park with the dog. I asked if she could please Iron my jacket. Again I normally do it myself. I was gone 3 hours and when I got back it was not done. 

Well she got fired today because they've warned her about being late. We live 20 minutes away from her work and she's always an hour late. I don't know what to do anymore. She leaves literally everything to the last minute. Then there's always this mass panick to get things done with. I don't know what else to do because I can't take this anymore.

"My[31M] in-laws 57F/62M] have gone no contact on us because my wife [28M] and I decided to go with a daycare center instead of them for a baby that isn’t even born yet.


I've been with my wife for over 9 years but married for 5 years. My in-laws have been married for about 11 years (FIL is my wife’s step father)


**History**


My in-laws loved me while my wife, Lara and I were dating. They both eagerly said ""yes"" when I asked for Lara's hand in marriage. Something changed a few years ago. My MIL is generally an emotionally unstable person, but it got worse once we got married. My MIL would pick fights with Lara over me over crazy things (like my Brother in Law was kicked out at our wedding reception by security because he got drunk and acted belligerent, but MIL was angry that I didn’t stop security from kicking the brother out, even though I wasn’t near that at the time. MIL didn’t talk to Lara or I for over two months until FIL told her to move on).  The fights have been frequent (at least two a year since) and always have the same cycle as the fight mentioned above (MIL picks a dumb fight, refuses to talk to Lara for 1-3 months, and then reconciles).


A major fight broke out between us in September 2016 after my MIL attacked me on social media (called me “ignorant” and “preachy” when I put out a FB post asking people to be respectful to each other during the election. She didn’t get the irony).  This fight also turned nasty when she was attacking Lara via text, and said to her “you’re never going to have children.” (We lost a pregnancy earlier in the summer). This was especially painful because we had just found out that week that we were 6 weeks pregnant.  My point, she can be very cold. The fight lasted several months, with the FIL eventually pushing the MIL to reconcile two days before Thanksgiving (he really wanted us to be able to celebrate the pregnancy with them after all those months). It was a bullshit  apology where she (like always) apologized to Lara and and half apologized to me (“sorry for a miscommunication…”)  Things have been steady now, but not by much.  Lara insists that her mom can’t lash out anymore and has been mostly better since then (but it’s only been 6 months). 


**Now** 


Two days ago, we were visiting my in-laws when the subject of childcare was brought up. We had previously said last December that we were glad we found an awesome person for our childcare, neither my FIL or MIL said much beyond acknowledging it. But Sunday, the MIL sorta flipped out.  She kept saying, “I just assumed you wanted me to watch the baby.” To which we said that we told her that we already told them months ago that we found someone. Both said they didn’t remember, which is a typical excuse for them.  We assured them that they’ll be able to baby sit and have alone time with the child, but MIL still seemed upset.


So a couple of days passed and we figured it was blowing over when my FIL messaged my wife telling her how extremely disappointed they are in our choice of childcare and that no matter who we got, “no one is more prepared than your mother to watch the baby.” This actually isn’t true.  They only own one car, a two seater, and we said to them that it’s important to us that whoever watches the baby that they have a car with a carseat in it for emergencies. Our main reason though, which we didn’t tell them, is that we can’t have a daycare person who constantly gets into fights with us, where out of the blue, we would have no where to take our child and we both work full time.


So Lara responded to FIL with this message:


&gt;Thanks for letting me know your thoughts. I appreciate hearing what you have to say. I know we did talk a long time ago about my mom watching my future baby, but after discussing it, we decided against this for a couple of reasons.  We did bring up  our decision back in December, although it may have been forgotten. I am sorry that this is upsetting to you.  I wish this would have been discussed earlier on, I don't want anyone upset this close to when the baby is due to arrive. I can understand why you are upset, but this is our decision and we hope everyone can respect it and move on.  I am hoping that everyone is able to move on from this  and focus on the joy of having a new baby in the family. I am very excited about this baby and I want this to be a celebration for everyone.


FIL responded with, “Then I guess we are done here” and after Lara asked what that meant, he said, “you made your decision. You don’t appreciate that your mother and I worked hard to put you through private high school and that I am paying a 50k student loan. So you got what you want and we’ll just leave it at that. I’ll get over it just fine, but your mother will probably have a harder time. Hope the baby is healthy and fine.”


And that’s it. Now I should say that he has a tendency to expect Lara to act EXACTLY as he wants.  For instance, when Lara and I were dating for only one year while I was in the Army, she told them she was going to fly out to see me during a college break, to which he forbade her to fly on a plane and when she still did it, he cut off her phone service as punishment. 


I’m sorry for rambling, I’m just not sure what to do here. My wife is devastated, but not entirely caught off guard. Our baby is due in 8 days, and she can’t wrap her mind around how her family won’t be there.  


So my question is, what can I do to help? Should I say anything to the in-laws? I usually say nothing and let my wife and the in-laws hash it out — but I am tired of being silent. My MIL said nothing during all this exchange yesterday, and she’s been so excited for the baby that I can’t image she’s okay with this.  What can I do to help my wife? She’s the sweetest, most kind person I know and I can’t stand seeing her so upset, especially when she’s so close to giving birth. 

**Edit:** Just to clarify my wife's thinking.  Lara is pretty fed up with everything. She says she's done playing their games and plans to not contact them in the future unless they reach out and flat out apologize for their behavior. 

**Edit 2:** So Quick update. First, thank you to all the people who gave such supportive advice. I/we really appreciate it.  Also, my MIL decided to break the NC already this morning (east coast time). She texted my wife only to tell her that she thinks she figured out the name of the baby (we were keeping it a secret but gave everyone in our family the first letter at Easter), and threatened to blast it all over FaceBook just to be cruel.  I think it's unlikely to be true, Lara and I both agree MIL is just trying to upset her, but I think it cemented the fact that we have to go NC with them until well-after the baby is due.  I'll post another update if anything else happens. Thank you again.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: In-laws have gone no-contact after we reemphasized that we were going with a professional for childcare. FIL took it as a personal slight against them and has declared their relationship is over.  How can I help my wife get through this? Should I contact my in-laws to either yell at or try and reconcile things?"

"My [23F] boyfriend [28M] is extremely absent-minded, to the point where I think he has an untreated brain injury. I want him to get help, but he doesn't think there is a problem. Together 3 years.


Let me start by saying, Charlie is an *extremely* smart guy. He's recently earned a Master's degree and works as an educator. Within his field, he is easily the smartest person I've ever met.
  
The problem is, once he is doing anything outside of that field, he is completely scatterbrained and forgetful. Some examples of what I mean include:

* Waking up early on the weekend and getting ready for work. If it happened once, it would just be a funny story. But it happens at least once a month. I'll wake up to find him putting on his suit and stuffing papers into his brief case. Then when I tell him ""Uh, babe....it's Saturday...."" he looks at me dumbfounded for a minute and then laughs it off and comes back to bed. There was one morning he actually made it like halfway to work before I called him freaking out because he was gone when I woke up. He just treats it as a funny mistake, but it really makes me worry about his mental health.

* He forgets stuff, constantly. When he leaves the apartment he will inevitably have to walk back in once for his wallet. Then again for his car keys. Then again for his work ID. It's gotten to the point where I put all his essentials in a bowl by the door and will remind him to stop and empty the bowl before he leaves. I've seen him set something down and then he completely clueless on where he put it less than a minute later. This is a very common occurrence.

* Dates and names are something completely foreign to him. He forgets my parents' first names constantly. He does not remember important birthdays to save his life. Earlier in the relationship I was slightly annoyed he forgot my birthday. I forgave him a few months later when he woke up on his own birthday.and completely forgot about it, too.

* Once for our anniversary he decided to do something really sweet and paid for a weekend at a romantic resort nearby. He had a few drinks, so I was driving, and he was supposed to be giving me directions. At some point, I realized the directions he was giving me were taking us back to our own apartment. When I pointed that out, he stopped and thought for a minute, then looked at me and said ""Uh, sorry, you need to turn around.""

Any one of these things now and then and I would just chuckle and assume forgetfulness is a personality trait. But all together? I think there is something wrong in his brain. I don't mean that as an insult, just a statement of fact.

I've tried to dig in to possible reasons for this stuff before. He did mention that he was in a humvee accident a few years ago when he was in the Army, but he says he was tested for brain injury and cleared by the Army doctors. He's perfectly convinced that he is just a little forgetful and it is no big deal. Personally, I think the Army might have missed something. I try to convince him to go back to a doctor and get retested. He'll sometimes mention that he'll try it, but it never actually happens. I'm very worried about the possibility of him getting worse over time, and I want many, many years with him.

This isn't a deal breaker situation for me. I don't mind helping him remember stuff and putting up with some occasional frustration. He is a super-wonderful boyfriend to me, and I'm very happy being with him. I'm just worried for him. I think he needs help, sooner rather than later. I just don't know how to convince him to go to a doc without bashing his feelings.

We are enrolled in a masters program, and we are about to graduate this month. The four of us have been working on a thesis-type project for the past year, and our final paper, which was completed as a group, is due tomorrow.

I volunteered to edit the final paper to make sure there weren't any grammatical errors and that it flows well between sections. I got to the first section that this person wrote, and while reading I thought, ""huh, this language sounds really technical and frankly more intellectual than what I usually hear out of his mouth."" 

I saw that he had included a footnote, so I went to the PDF cited in the footnote, and I saw the problem: he had copied sentences and phrases from the source, word for word, WITHOUT using quotation marks.

I am going through the entire 70-page paper, looking at each of his sections, and so far I've found at least 5 instances of him doing this. I also found a case where he did not include a source for a sentence he took straight out of an organization's website. It is taking me a long time to do this, and I expect I may have to pull an all-nighter to check each of his sentences in addition to all of the other copy editing I have to do.

I called and texted him, no answer. Then I remembered that he was on vacation and probably on a long haul flight right now.

Again, we are in a masters program. In corporate communications. At a good school. It blows my mind that he thought this was OK to do. If this had been caught by the professor, we could all have been failed and not been able to graduate.

What do I do? I am so pissed right now. Should I write to the professor after the paper is submitted and demand that he be penalized for this? Should I let it go since we're about to graduate anyway and won't see each other again? I'm so mad that I can't think straight right now.

"Me [22 F] with my coworkers[22-38 M/F], how to deal with aftermath of sexual harrassment


I have worked with this company for 6 months straight out of college and I am not sure how to deal with a series of events that have transpired so I am hoping for really any advice.

One Friday afternoon a few of us all went out for happy hour. At this happy hour, Brad [30 M], who has worked there for 8 years, began to make advances towards me. He took pictures of me from across the bar and started asking me person questions about my relationship with my bf [22 M] of 2.5 years. 

He then starts asking me if I were single and could ""fuck"" anybody at work, who would I choose. After trying to deflect this question I responded, ""maybe if Dude were straight, I would consider making a pass at him."" It was an awful way to deflect for sure, and I should have continued to disengage, but at the time I was just hoping it would end the conversation.

He proceeds to continue to ask me if I was SURE there was nobody else, and even texted me ""Are you SURE there is NOBODY else you might be interested at all ;)"" ""No one here at this bar at all? ;)"" to which I responded. ""Yup. Are we all gonna go to another bar?""

He pulls me aside and starts saying we should ditch everyone else and go somewhere else. He says we should go somewhere, but to definitely not tell my female coworkers we were leaving. I felt uncomfortable, rejected his idea and left. I drove home(was sober), and suddenly got an influx of texts from him saying that he was not interested, it was silly of me to think he was, etc. The next morning he asks that I do not bring it up at work and put it behind us.

I was more than willing to do this, but I came in to work and overheard him telling others that I got blackout drunk and threw myself at him. That hurt, but I was still willing to let it go.  However, it kept happening. 

On one occasion(the Thursday afterward) it had gotten to me so I cried in the bathroom. An older woman overheard and led me to the head of the facility and contacted HR(we do not have a physical HR department on location, and I had no idea how to do so myself). 

I can only guess that another coworker had witnessed this also, and let him know he needs to chill before I take action, because I immediately got another influx of texts saying ""Hey this better not go further than between us."" ""We promised to keep this between us."" If you are going to take this further, atleast let me know."" ""I hope this does not need to go any further at all."" And he began to stalk through my lab(we technically work in two different labs at the same facility). 

My supervisor pulled me aside and asked if I knew why Brad kept peering through our windows, wandering in to our lab and hovering over me. I simply told him that I rejected him at a bar and he was not happy with the rejection. The stalking continued for 3 days and culminated in him waiting at my station at a time when normally I would be there alone and my supervisor kicking him out and going to the facility manager himself to discuss this issue.

Finally, a week after the I went to HR, they came to our building with lawyers and spoke with me in person. I showed them the texts and within the hour he was fired.

My current dilemma is with my other coworkers. One major point to this, is Brad is my manager's son. My manager openly cried when he found out his son was fired. Brad had already told so many people his ""side"" and that he only got fired because I made up a story and convinced another coworker Hannah(who literally had no involvement at any point) to lie for me. The rest of my coworkers believed his story and are treating me cruelly. I am being blatantly ignored people are saying things to me like ""woah be careful around RazSpazMcGaz she will make up some story to HR if you piss her off."" I don't want to rehash it or be petty, but no one has heard my side, or even thought that maybe this is much more than what Brad led them to believe. I just want to do my job in peace, but I am not sure how to get there, and I work in a very niche field so leaving is not an immediate option. What can I do?

  **tl;dr**: Coworker sexually harassed me, and after lawyers got involved, he was fired. Facing backlash from other coworkers."

"Me [28F] unsure what to do about odd boy [8M]


Im sorry this is long, I'm just so unsure what to do and have tried to include everything. 

I live with my husband [32M] and my son [1M]. A lady, around the age of 40, has recently moved a few houses up from mine. She has a son, 8 years old, named Alex. We first met Alex around 2 months ago when my husband would work on his car in the front yard. Alex would pop in and say hello only staying for a few minutes. 

Alex popped in one day and stayed for hours. I told him he needed to go home and tell his mum where he was. I felt uncomfortable having Alex in my house not knowing if his mother knew where he was. He told me she let him play on the street all day and it was ok, I insisted he go home and tell her where he was. Alex popped home a few times. He was at my house for around 5 hours. When he would return from seeing his mother he would say she was asleep and had been all day. I finally sent him home saying that I needed to speak to his mother to see if it was ok that he was inside a strangers house. Alex was reluctant to go home and tried to talk his way into staying longer. 
I met his mother a week later. She said she was ok with him visiting my partner and I.

I'm going to put this in dot points to make it easier as there is a lot to get through and I'm not sure what to do. 

- Alex talks a lot, asks a lot of questions and is known to tell elaborate stories. 
- Alex said the police have been to his house. He said that some time ago his mother, Sue, had friends staying over who accused Sue of taking drugs. He said they investigated the mother but did not charge her as they had no evidence she was doing drugs. Alex said the friends were in fact the ones doing drugs. He also said the friends kept giving him cash, he didn't know what for. 
- Alex always has a roll of cash on him. A small roll and I'm not sure how much, but he always shows me and says that he gets given it by family friends.
- Alex watches my house. If he is not at school he is playing on the street. He's a kid so he he asks a lot of questions and is very inquisitive. He wants to know where, when and how long I'm going for. He tells me he sees me leave and get home. He surprises me a lot when I pull into my drive. Sometimes I think he is waiting in my yard. 
- Alex saw that I had people knock on my door. He questioned me about who they were. He thought they were DHS. When asked why he would think that, he said they have been to his house and taken him away to live with his Aunty for a while because DHS thought Sue was on drugs.
-Alex's favorite shows are murder shows. He says he sits up at night watching them and loves to see what people are capable of. 
- My husband's car broke down at 10pm along our street. Alex popped out of nowhere and sat with my husband and his friend while they fixed the car. This was when Alex and my husband had only just met, it was late at night and he was out on the street until the car got started. 
- Alex has become jealous of my son and my niece who is 4 years old. As Alex does not have a father on the scene, he looks up to my partner. I've noticed when Alex is not being watched he can get really rough with my son and will glare daggers at my niece and ignore her. When he is being watched he will play gentle and hug my son, all while looking at me and my partner to see that we are watching. He is also very polite to my niece if we are looking. He is not allowed alone with my son or niece, even if it's for me to quickly pop to the toilet. 
- Alex recently asked me if I'm scared at night. When I asked why, he said that there had been gunshots. He also said because I am a girl. I said that I'm not as I have big dogs. We then had a conversation with him telling me anyone could easily get in and what would I do, what about my son, the dogs are outside so how will they protect me, and many more questions. 

Alex is a well mannered polite boy. He can also be VERY clingy and needy. He has no father and gets jealous of other kids relationships with my partner. He is beginning to be a nightmare as he is knocking on my door at least 3 times a day trying to come in and play. We are trying to get Alex to back off and haven't let him come inside for a while and plan to not let him in again. Sometimes he will knock, call out and sit against my door for around 20 mins until I've had enough and will answer the door.

I'm really weirded out by this boy but I'm also worried for his well-being. He's a kid and they have amazing imaginations. He tells a lot of stories so I'm not sure what is true, but he seems to know a lot of grown up things and can go in to detail when asked. I'm worried as I don't trust him near my son or niece, but then I feel sorry for him that he seems to be craving a male to look up to. 
My partner and I agree that he can't be inside with us anymore, but I'm worried for the boy as he wanders the streets all day and sometimes late at night. 
Friends have told me to call and speak to someone about him but I'm not sure there is enough to be said. I don't know that he is being neglected or treated badly. I know I wouldn't let my son roam the streets and go into strangers houses, but I'm not sure if that is neglect?? 

I don't know what to do, if anything at all. I have a lot of people with different opinions on this and it would be great if Reddit could help me find the answer, or tell me that I'm just overreacting. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading.

TL:DR Boy visiting my place. Becoming clingy and territorial of my husband, trying to make distance between us and the boy but he may not have a good home. Unsure if I need to contact someone. "

"Me [25 f] overheard my co-workers [20’s f] making fun of my scar i had from heart surgery a few years ago, feeling very insecure


[removed]"
"Me [31M] with my girlfriend [28F] 3 years. She has mysterious illness. I feel like I'm turning into her carer.


At the start of the year my girlfriend [30F] had a sore knee. This has slowly progressed in severity until she ""feels like her legs are dying"" and now she's all but bedbound and can barely walk. She's seen multiple doctors, had MRI and X-Rays and nobody can work out what's wrong with her other than prescribing pain relief. Naturally, we're both terrified - we were running half marathons together this time last year.

It's obviously had a big hit on our relationship. We used to be out most nights of the week and busy socializing on weekends, now we spend most of our time in her bed watching Netflix. Even this is painful for her and most of the time she's grimacing, groaning and screaming in pain, which is really upsetting to see.

It's also really changed the dynamics of our relationship as she's now almost entirely reliant on me. I'm cleaning her flat, cooking for her, doing her laundry, shopping, assisting her in walking, taking her to clinics and hospitals and so on. Now she's suggested that I move in with her as she might need my help full time.

I really love her, but this dependence is sucking the love out of our relationship and slowly grinding me down (any intimacy has dried up as she's so sensitive to pain I can't even cuddle her properly). The pain makes her snap at me, and I get frustrated and snap back at her. It's gotten to the pain where I'm HUGELY relieved when I get to leave her flat. Now she's talking about me moving in as ""I might need your help all the time"".

I love her and am trying to do my level best to be a supportive, helpful and understanding partner, but I really don't want to turn into her full-time carer. She's from overseas so her family aren't around and her friends are too busy to help out. Has anyone been in a situation like this?

tldr Girlfriend sick, am doing almost everything for her. Wants me to move in and look after her. 

edit 1: thanks for all the advice below. Funnily enough it was the people telling me to be mercenary and break up with her that were the most help, because I was all ""well I'm not going to do THAT"" which helped me decide to keep doing what I'm doing for a bit.

Also in slightly bigger news the disease isn't so mysterious anymore. The results of a hip MRI came in and she's got a lump on her pelvis. So... yeah :( We've got a doctors appointment tomorrow to find out what it is.

edit 2: first of all none of my post was talking about breaking up with her - just wanted advice on how to cope with  sick partner and not get too miserable myself buuuut

it's all a moot point because the doctors appointment got brought forward and it's a very large ""bony destructive malignant tumour"" in her hip that's going to require immediate radio and surgery. So her family are flying her off to her home country at 7am tomorrow morning and have offered to fly me over v soon"
"Me [26F] with my dad[49M] and stepmom [29F]. Stepmom treating me like dirt in my own home. I know what I want to do but I've never had to stand up for myself. How do I stop being a doormat?


My stepmom is the major problem here, and it comes from her 1. trying to act like she's my mother and 2. trying to do it while she and my dad are living with me temporarily in the house I own and finally 3. me not having the guts or ability or experience to stand up to her properly.

When I was 15 my single dad (who I lived with) began dating my stepmom, and pretty quickly married her. I didn't know at the time, but she was a lot younger than either of them let on. My dad was in his late 30s and I thought my stepmom was 30 at the time, but she was 18.

I moved out when I turned 18, fell in love, and married when my husband and I were both 20. We bought a house, but at 24 he was killed in a workplace accident. Insurance paid out enough for most of the rest of the house. With our savings included I was able to refinance and on my lone salary I'm just able to keep my head above water. The house will be paid off in another four years.

Not long after, my dad's business went a bit rocky and his business partner screwed him over. Dad lost his house, found work in the same industry under someone else and he worked out with me that if he and my stepmom moved in with me rent-free temporarily, in 3 years he'd be able to get back on his feet independently, vs renting and taking 10-15.

Now for the last 7 months there's me in the house with my dad and stepmom, and she is utterly overbearing. She's almost the same age as me and treats me like she owns the house and it's been getting worse. When she first married my dad she took to the sweet mommy role a bit too hard and it was kind of creepy even when I thought she was 30. Knowing we're not really any different in age now it's just screwed up.

She tries to make decisions on how the house is decorated, and it's painful to keep shooting them down. She berates me for leaving cutlery out and items unwashed, and it's not like she's just a nitpicky housemate, it's like she's still trying to be my mother. She'll try telling me when to tidy up, that I have to keep up with chores around the house and when to do shopping. I don't get to keep the refrigerator stacked with what I like, because it all gets pushed aside and thrown out for what she wants. 

I'm not allowed to cook in my own kitchen and I've kept my anger down for so long mostly for my dad's sake. I love him to bits and he's on track to be out with her in a couple more years but he's always been hands-off. If I complain to him about my stepmom he tells me he doesn't want to hear the fighting, and to fix it myself, not to drag him into it. Thing is, he's part of this. He and her are the item and I wish he'd have my back about her behaviour.

The last month has been the worst. I have the bedroom me and my husband used as my bedroom, and I have an entertainment room and a home office that it's a constant fight to keep how I want it. Stepmom completely reorganised the entertainment room into an inaccessible showoff-only half living room half dining room that's all show and she marked it to only be used for special occasions. She moved my husband's desk out of the office which shit me even more as I use it daily, and marked that room as her art room. She's dumped other things I have in the rest of the house in my room like I'm some kind of recalcitrant teenager who refuses to put their things away. The former entertainment gear was jammed into the side of the breakfast nook in about the most uncomfortable place in the house.

She does this stuff while I'm at work, and the last thing I want to do is deal with that when I come home tired at 6. Make no mistake her last big changes didn't last. as soon as I had a Sunday to myself I moved everything back where it should be. It caused a screaming match (which was more just her screaming at me and my dad, and me trying to ignore her) when she got back home, and the last week has everything back in order as I want it but I know it won't last. She doesn't work and I do, so I have half a day a week where she's not in the house where she has 8-9 hours every weekday when I'm not home to screw with my house. I can wordlessly constantly fix it without successfully demanding she stop but I'm so tired of that kind of passive aggressiveness on my part.

This is meant to be my home and it feels like I'm dealing with someone else's child.

The problem is I think that the relationship started out with her actually filling a mother kind of role, and I'd never had that, so I find it extra hard to talk back to her. I've never had to argue for myself before in my life with anyone. I know exactly what I want but not how to get it, or how to force it. Every time I try to speak back to say what I want to, like ""Look here, this is my house, sit down shut up and get used to it and don't touch what isn't yours because you're lucky to be getting this chance"" I choke up and all I do is bawl in tears. Of course she doesn't respect me, I can't offer even the slightest resistance to her.

What do I do to turn this around? My question is probably best summed in the TLDR...
  ---   
**tl;dr**: My dad and my stepmom (who's almost the same age as me) have moved in with me for a few years while they get back on their feet. My stepmom is weirding me out and trying to be an ultra controlling mother figure when we're almost the same age. I have no practiced ability to assert myself. I want to make her to stop with the mommy act, I want her to shut up and accept this is my house and my rules, I want to be able to actually enforce my rules, I want to get all the conversations I have in my head with her out in the open and make sure she knows she's here by my grace alone and she's not to change a thing in the house unless I say. I want to be able to take respect. I just want her to leave me be. I know I'm a doormat and I need to stop. How do I stop being a doormat? How do I go from never having needed to assert myself, to asserting myself successfully? Why isn't there a course for this kind of thing?"

"I [28M] am a high school teacher. One of my students [16F] wrote a poem confessing to having a crush on me and delivered it in front of me, other teachers, students, and my girlfriend [23F]. Should I even do anything about it or just pretend it didn't happen?


So, I'm a social studies/history teacher at a public high school. 

A good friend and fellow teacher teaches a writer's workshop elective class that is quite popular with our more creative-minded students, where, as the name suggests, they write. Poetry, stories, journals, and they are encouraged to get out of their comfort zone and write about anything they want to share. 

This class culminates with a coffee/open mic night here at the school where parents and students may come and sip coffee while listening to students from the class deliver whatever work they feel like sharing.

English is not my subject, but I do think this open mic night is an awesome thing and I really enjoy listening to what students have to say, so I have helped out with it and attended it ever since I began teaching here. This year, my girlfriend came along as well.

Now, the problem. I have a student, call her Jane. I had Jane last year in her freshman year, and now again in her sophomore year. I never felt she behaved any differently towards me than any other student. She's very bright, and happens to be one of those creative-minded students who are drawn to the writer's workshop class.

At open mic night (last Friday), she got up on stage to deliver a poem she had written about ""a man she can't have"". Like I said, she's quite skilled in her writing and I was looking forward to hear what she had written.

So, she starts reading her poem. It's pretty typical high-school crush stuff. She has some guy that she secretly adores, thinks is so handsome, she wishes she could have him but knows it will never happen. Nothing too sexual or graphic, just teenage lovey-dovey stuff. And she ends it with a line saying she wishes she could have told him all this, but she can't, because ""He's my history teacher..""

She looked right at me when she delivered that last line, so, it's not really a question about who she was talking about. I looked wide-eyed at the English teacher who runs this class, I could tell from the look on her face that she wasn't expecting that last bit any more than anyone else in the room. Pretty much every student or parent or teacher who happens to know she's in my history class are staring at me awkwardly. And my girlfriend is obviously shocked as well.

Jane left the stage amid polite applause. I didn't talk to her again that night, I spoke to the English teacher who told me that Jane had changed the last line from a more innocent one that she had used in class. I just politely excused myself for the evening.

My girlfriend says she is fine and it's obviously just a teenager's crush and nothing to get worked up about, but she does seem a little upset about it, though she won't admit it.

I suddenly find myself walking on eggshells in class around Jane. I guess I'm trying to avoid saying or doing anything to give the appearance of reciprocating. I have not said anything about her poem to her. A lot of my other students keep bringing it up and asking what I thought. I've been playing dumb and pretending I just didn't notice that last line.

I'm trying to decide if feigned ignorance is best here, or if this is something I should actually shut-down. 

Clearly nothing is going to happen here. For obvious reasons speaking with her privately I feel is a bit out of the question, but I also feel that speaking to her about it in front of others would be wrong as well. The English teacher is encouraging me to just not bring it up at all, and she does have a lot more experience than me in these things, I just don't know if that is the right answer.

Link to original : https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/699ld4/me_27m_and_my_gf_24f_of_3_months_who_keeps_making/


Hi Redditors,

It hasn't been nearly as long as I expected, but I promess i'd update if anything new came.

I snooped on my GF cellphone and even tho I shouldn't, I'm glad I did. She lied to me everyday since we first met. She lied about never cheating (physically) on anyone and lied when she told me that nothing ever happened between her and her best Friend [25m]. She explicitly told him that she wants to keep their relationship a secret and that she would never stop seeing him. Every 1-2 days there was these ""i miss you"" and ""i'm thinking about you"" message. She also made fun of me with him, called me controlling, jealous, sick, freak. She allowed him to constantly insult and disrespect me. She told Everyone I've ever met from her social network (sneaky edit: by social Network I meant like friends and familly, this is bas english from my part XD.  Facebook and shit would have been ""social media"". Sorry -_-)  that she was lying to me.  She would txt him at night, in my own bed, about that once I was asleep.  She bitched myself and our relationship.  

I decided to be the better man and stay calm. I told her how broken I am, how disgusted I am and how dirty she is to cheat emotionnaly with me since day #1.  I also told her that her social Network must suck if no one cared to tell her that this wasn't an appropriate behavior. I told her she would never be able to develop/maintain any kind of meaningfull relationship as long as she would keep lying to herself and others, and that her depression and anxiety are being fuelled by her own stupidness.

So yeah, I'm pretty Heartbroken, but at least I'm proud of how I reacted. My biggest fear right now is to never be able to trust again, but that's not something I wish to think about right now.  I also feel really dumb.

Thank you. xx

TL;DR: was lied on, emotionnaly cheated on and disrespected by my (now ex) GF. Decided to be the better man and tackled it like a good guy.  Am now single and ashamed.


Edit: you bunch of lovely assholes, I hope you're happy! You're making my eyes sweat! Seriously every single comments here are so damn helpfull and good to read. I can never thank you enough for giving me this much support at this time.

Edit 2: all right so someone commented that what I told her, and the way I did, doesn't qualify as being ""the better man"".  For the sake of transparency, I will write here what I told her and wrote in answer to this redditor.  Better man or not, I'd rather you make your own opinion :

I see your point and pondered with the option of rephrasing that part of my post.  For the sake of transparency, it went something like this:

""look, I have no reason to tell you my 2 cents but for your sake I will anyway.  After all you told me and what I saw it's clear that you handle all your relationships the same way. You try to present yourself in a way that will be 100% pleasing for the other person, wether it be a Friend, a family-member or a prospect. Look at your friend XX, you know he was cheated on by his ex and you know he hates cheaters. Well you were so affraid this would change His perception of you that you hid the fact that you cheated on your ex and lied to him again and again.

In doing so you are lying to that person as well as you. You hide facts about you that would teint negatively the perception other people have of you.  You can't expect to hide parts of who you are and have true friends and meaningfull relationships in return. So as long as you can't accept your past, try to run away from your problems, try to convince yourself that some things never happened, you Shall never be happy, you shall never be able to love and respect yourself and therefore you'll never be able to invest yourself in a relationship that would make you truely happy. Not because your partner will see you as perfect, but because he'll know exactly what are your dirty secrets and imperfections and Will love you none the less.

Also, don't you find it weird that you mentally crashed just after you cheated on your ex and that you are on medication ever since? I think you're right in thinking that you'll be on that shit for your whole life if you don't straight your shit up, start acting like a grown-ass woman and stop having secrets and lies, which fuel all that shit inside you. I'm gonna go ahead and bet that as long as you don't come clean with yourself and the people you feel are important in your life, you'll be filled with remorse, doubt and guilt. And the way I see it, your anxiety Will feed out of these feelings and will keep growing like a cancer.

So for your sake, for the sake of the people in your life, I suggest you Do a really fucking big clean up in your life.""

Mic drop.

Edit 3: this will be my last update. I can't thank you all enough for all the Strength you've given me, all the thinking you steered inside as well as all the good laugh I had from your posts. I guess the biggest life lesson you should get from that is that YOU are the only person that can decide what YOU are willing to accept in a relationship and YOU should NOT forget yourself in whatever the relationship you wish to pursue. I love you Reddit, I really do, and I wish you all the best of luck in whatever it is is coming your way. ❤️"
"I [25/F] wasn't invited to a friend/co-worker's [27/F] wedding, but other friends were. Unsure of how to have her stop talking to me about her big day.


I met my friend Amanda at work over 3 years ago. She was new to the team, and I had the opportunity to help train her. We clicked instantly, and became really good friends pretty fast. 

There was never any doubt in my mind that we weren't close friends. Although her schedule was slightly different than mine (She gets off work an hour or two after I do), we always made plans and met up for shopping, drinks, hanging out, and double dates with our boyfriends. 

Obviously, we have mutual friends we work with, and we all try to have dinner together every once in a while, or go out to a bar/club.

I was very happy for Amanda when she got engaged to her longtime high school sweetheart just over a year ago. They're absolutely perfect for one another, and when she showed me the ring I was floored with how pretty it is. I did ask when the wedding would be, and she said late in the summer of 2017. It's coming up in August. 

She has spoken to be almost daily about her wedding planning process, which I'm totally fine with. One day, while we were hanging out, she proactively told me that she wasn't inviting close friends/co-workers to the ceremony. She wanted a small and intimate wedding with her and her soon to be husband's family, and then everyone would be invited to the reception after. This seemed like a really good idea, and I said I liked that a lot! 

However, after she sent out invitations, three mutual friends/co-workers snapchatted their invitations, and it's not just a ""reception only"" invitation. The snaps weren't sent directly to me, but were on their story, and I just so happened to see them while clicking through stories. I was hurt that I didn't receive an invitation, even if only to the reception, but I didn't bother bringing it up to Amanda. Clearly, we weren't as close of friends as I thought, and she had already made it clear to me that she had no plans of inviting friends/co-workers. However, since she had invited some other girls we work with, I figured it was just a roundabout way of her politely telling me I wasn't invited while trying to spare my feelings. 

However, she still talks to me daily about her wedding that's coming up in just a few months, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. She constantly talks about everything. Recently, she talked my ear off during our lunch break about her dress, and then showed me all of the pictures she took in it before sending it off to get altered. It's a very pretty dress, but was a harsh reminder that I won't get to be there to see her in it or celebrate her marriage. 

I'm perfectly polite and engaged in our conversations when she speaks to me about her wedding, but it's the only topic that ever comes up, and any attempt to change it up somehow comes straight back to her big day. I get it, she's excited, and she's allowed that, but it stings. A lot. Obviously, I've distanced myself from hanging out with her as much because her thoughts on our friendship are/were drastically different than mine. 

How can I politely tell her to stop talking to me about it, without hurting her feelings, or having it turn nasty? And if it does turn nasty, how should I even begin to handle it? I don't think Amanda would make things nasty, she's very nice, but I don't want her to feel like I'm attacking her in any way and then make a mountain out of a molehill. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I met my friend at work a few years back. She got engaged, and told me she wasn't inviting friends/co-workers to the ceremony, but to the reception after. Well, she invited three of our mutual friends/co-workers to the ceremony, and I didn't receive an invitation, even for the reception. She talks to me about her wedding planning/big day constantly, and it hurts. Any advice on how to tell her to stop talking to me about it? 

**EDIT**: I never expected this to receive as many comments/suggestions as it has. I have read every single comment thus far, and I've gained a lot of insight to the situation, and how I should likely move forward! I will definitely speak up when Amanda tries to talk to me next. I will advise her that, while I'm happy for her, I have no interest in chatting about/listening to her talk about a wedding/celebration that I wasn't invited to. If she tries to continue, I'll deflect it as politely, or humorously, as possible. If she freaks out, well, I'll handle that to the best of my ability.

**EDIT 2**: I'm seeing a lot of repeat comments, and just want to reiterate a small fact: **She's never asked for my address, nor does she know where I live** and vice versa. Although we hung out a lot, it was never at eachother's place. She was living with her parents until she and her fiance bought a house recently, so she wasn't comfortable having people over. And I live with several roommates in a shared home with my boyfriend, so I never invite people over. If she did intend to invite me, I imagine she would have asked for my address, or given it to me by hand. Neither of these things happened, and with her first telling me she had no intention of inviting a particular group I fit into, I'm pretty confident that she never intended to invite me from the get go. 

With that said, I plan on politely nudging her to stop when she approaches me next. I'll update this when that happens. Thank you all so much for your advice! 


**UPDATE**
(Here is the update I tried posting on Saturday that was deleted!)

Hello, everyone!
I meant to update this yesterday when I got off work, but I forgot! So, here's a slightly late update on what transpired after I received a lot of great feedback and suggestions.
I took my second break a little later than usual, hoping that Amanda wouldn't notice. Well, she did, and she hopped up from her desk and followed me into the break room. She said hello, asked me how I was doing (for once), and before I had fully sat down to relax began chatting about her wedding (again). I waited a moment, then politely cut in with a smile and said, ""Amanda, I really appreciate that you want to share all of this with me, but this talk makes me slightly uncomfortable."" She looked really confused and asked me why. I was honest and told her that it makes me upset that all it seems she wants to talk to me about is her wedding, and I wasn't invited.
She kinda laughed it off and said, ""But I didn't invite anyone from work so it's not just you!""
So, that comment alone made it very clear that I was intentionally excluded from her invitation list. Yes, she has every right to choose who she wants to invite to her wedding, but there's a right way and a wrong way to go about it. Telling me she was excluding a specific group that includes me, then inviting other people and lying to me about it at that point, is NOT the right way to go about it. A simple, ""Hey! I know we're friends and all, but I made the decision not to invite you to my wedding for X reason"" would have totally been okay, and I would have respected that decision 100%.
I kinda gave her a weird look and said, ""But you invited friend 1, 2, and 3? I saw it on their snapchat stories a while back. Unless that was a mistake...?""
I have never seen a woman turn around so fast and bolt out of a room. She looked positively angry! I imagine she went to find all three of these girls and tell them that I found out. Either way, I got to enjoy the last few minutes of my break in peace. She didn't approach me for the rest of the day, and avoided me as we both walked the same path to leave the building and get to the general area where we had parked our cars.
Safe to say, I've lost a few friends, but I'm not heartbroken about it. I'm just glad there wasn't any drama involved in my saying anything, and I'm pretty sure all four of them will be avoiding me from here on out.
Thank you everyone who took the time to read my post and gave me some advice, both good and bad. I appreciate it all. :)

**tl;dr:** I told her on Friday that I wasn't invited. She tried to tell me that no one from work was invited, so I asked about the three that she did. She left the room really fast, and I'm sure she won't be bothering me again."

"Girlfriend (22F) asks me point blank if I'm less attracted to her because she put on weight. Do I (23F) lie? What should I say?


We've been together almost 2 years. 

Weight has been something that fucked with her for her entire life. I would never ever ever bring it up on my own. Never. Even perceived or minor accidental slights in the past I have seen completely shatter her self-esteem / worth.

But recently she gained kind of a bit of weight and its noticeable and she's been asking me during sex or when I'm touching her body if I find her less attractive because of it. Truth is I do.. But I just say nahh and dismiss it. Occasionally she'll then press me for more, ""No, you like my body?""

I don't want to lie because I don't really like it. But I am really very sure that I don't want to tell the truth. Dismissing works great, but what about when it comes to actively saying I like something that I don't like? Is there any way around this?

  **tl;dr**: GF historically very sensitive about weight, asking me point blank do I still find her attractive, what does one say?"

"How can I[14M]help my sister[23F] after a bad incident?


Good day/night to all. I wonder if you guys can help me with something. 

My oldest sister Elie went through something horrible recently. She was in a car incident that was bad. She was with her husband and they went straight to the hospital. My sister is fine her injuries were not that bad but from what I've overheard from my parents when they talked to each other last night Elie lost the baby she had in her. Her husband also passed away last night because of his injuries.

In a week or two Elie will come back to stay with us for a bit and I am here asking for advice about her. How can I help my sister with this? I am the youngest of three kids I have an older brother as well and he will be back home too so we can be here for Elie. She has always been really nice to me and I've looked up to my big sister. But now I don't know how can I be of use to her so I ask you for help? What can I do good people?

tl;dr my sister was in a car incident. She was with her husband who died last night because of the injuries. My sister also lost the baby she had in her and now she is going to stay with us back home. How can I help my sister with this? What can I do for her?"
"I [25F] found out my Dad [50M] is behaving inappropriately (sexual) at his job


Hi, I searched for ""family advice forum"" and found here. Making the title for this gave me trouble, it doesn't really give the whole explanation of what I found. Also English is not my first language and I might make mistakes so I'm sorry. Thank you for reading.

My family (Dad, Mom, older brother and sister, me) moved to US when I was 17 after bad conditions in our home country. We all had to learn English and get jobs. I learned programming for a skill and now work in IT. I do database maintenance and some other things, for a company. My parents are not very good with computer so I help when they have any problems.

My dad (50) is small business owner now with another man. It's a shoe shop in our city. He uses his laptop for work stuff and yesterday it got viruses. I looked to fix it and I saved his data and removed virus, but I found his virus was from porn site material. He had many porn downloaded and saved, hundreds of files. This is a problem because also with the porn he has many photographs of shoes and feet. These are taken inside his shop (I have been in it and recognized the place, and they are shoes he sells there.) They include women's feet who are trying shoes in the shop. I know this isn't porn but the actual porn is also mostly feet and shoes, but sexual. Like the women are naked.  

Since I saw this I think now that maybe he has an inappropriate behavior or intention at work because he relates shoes to sex. I mean that the customers don't know he thinks this way of it or that he photographs their feet. I'm concerned about this.

My question is what should I do with what I found? I thought of 3 options and if you can give advice, it would help a lot. 1: I tell him what I found and ask about it. 2: I tell my mom and ask her to talk to him. 3: I tell his business partner.

Maybe there is more options I don't know yet so if you guys have any other ideas, please let me know. Maybe I'm ""making mountains out of mole hills"" and if this is true also tell me that? Also my family needs his income from his business, he would have to find another job if he quit. But I don't know if he would quit just because I found it. I don't know, I'm confused.

TL;DR my Dad is small business (shoe shop) owner and I found lots of feet kind of porn on his computer. I also found pictures he takes of his customers feet when they try shoes on.

Edit to include: There were also videos he took inside the store that zoom in on customer's feet from the back area of the store."
