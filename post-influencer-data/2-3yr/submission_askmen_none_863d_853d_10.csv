"How do I stop eating dog treats?


My dog is my best friend, so naturally I've tried his food to make sure he was getting the best experience. Actual dog food is pretty gross, but I've tried his treats and they're pretty alright. I won't go into details, but basically I have a lifetime supply of dog treats. So 1 or 2 treats once in a while turned into 1 or 2 treats a day. Whenever I get the munchies after a toke, I practically eat them anytime my dog eats them. I've chowed down entire boxes of we're being honest. But I want to stop because first off, I don't think it's healthy. They make my stomach feel really... let's just say I put on practically no weight. Secondly, my friends humiliate me. They treat me just like a dog. They'll boss me around, and tell me to go run errands with my dog. I've tried standing up for myself, but they offer me some dog treats to get their way, and you know, I'm not gonna say no, so I usually end up doing whatever they want me to. The thing is, I'm becoming pretty dependent on the dog treats, to the point that anytime I come across any other food, I scarf an insane amount down. I took a long look at my life, and I realize all I do is hang out in the back of my friends van. I dropped out of high school. I don't have a real job, I've been wearing the same clothes for what seems like forever, I look like a druggy, and most of my social experiences include being chased by lunatics all because I couldn't say no to some dog treats. I've read that the first step towards fixing any problem is admitting it. "

"When do you stop showering with your daughter?


My little girl is 2 (3 in september) and occasionally we will shower together. Its a fun bonding experience. She likes it when I hold her in the water and we can be silly and laugh while I teach her how to shampoo her hair and get clean. There is absolutely nothing sexual about it. My wife thinks its fine but my mother says she is too old and its weird. I showered with my dad till I was 5. And yeah as she gets older it will definitely stop. But men, when did you stop bathing with your kids?"
"When you meet a girl (that you are interested in) is it better to come off like a nice friend or to flirt from the start?


Just wondering I don't like flirting that much, has the friendly approach worked for you guys?

Edit 1: I'm in high school which should have been specified earlier. So bars and work places don't apply but I appreciate all the comments.

Edit 2: I know that being a friend won't work. I was trying to ask when you first approach a girl do you make friendly small talk for a bit and then flirt or just go up to her and cut straight to the chase.

"Farted while talking on the phone right before our first date. She started laughing. What do I do now?


In my defense, I was half asleep when she called."
"What's the worst thing your SO has ever said to you? Not an ex but a current SO.


It's amazing how emotionally abusive people can be without caring. I posted this because of what my SO said to me tonight. She apologized for saying it but not meaning it. Backstory, I was travelling without her (different country) and decided to take a spontaneous excursion to another state for a few days for a festival. I didn't tell her until I got there and she was pissed and started radio silence. The first night I got really ill, almost went to ER but didn't have insurance because I was out of country. I texted her about being sick, nothing. Tonight it was brought up (6 months later) and she said I deserved what I got. That I could have gone to the hospital and she wouldn't have cared. Update: said to my SO today, ""how do you think your life would be like if we didn't met?"" ""Better off"" was the answer."
"At what point should your roommates girlfriend start paying rent?


So, I have a roommate and recently (last two months) she's been staying here nearly every night and I'm lost here. At what point is it considered her place of living? Should she start paying her way? What's the process with this and how do I go about this?"

"How would you feel if someone you were dating did a background check on you out of curiosity?


Things such as; credit history, place of residence, criminal record ect. I work in information security and I wonder if it would upset you if your significant other admitted to doing this when you were dating?
Only using public legal databases.

Edit: To re-iterate, using publicly accessible information, according to the laws of the country in which you live. "
"[NSFW] Men who were dumped because the sex was bad, how are y'all doing now?


I've seen a few of you in the comment section that would describe that your SO broke up with you since the sex wasn't what your partner expected.


How are you guys doing now? 


How did you cope?


If you found a new partner, how are they dealing with the sex? and if things are going good, what improvement did make?


What tip/advice would you give to those who were dumped because sex wasn't good enough?"
"What excuse do people use to justify shitty behavior that you hate?


It frustrates me when people use being ""hangry"" as an excuse for bad behavior when I feel like I was permanently hungry from the ages 11-25. It's like Bane from batman - ""You merely adopted the hunger, but I was born in it, molded by it. By the time I was full, I was already a man. But I still never yelled at someone because my food was 15 minutes later than I would have liked."" You're just hungry. Eat something or suck it up. "
"Going to be having a girl over for the first time in nearly a year. Any prep tips?


I'm 20 if it matters. Haven't pursued anyone or had any interest in girls since my first girlfriend broke up with me last year until I realized I need to fuck or I might drop dead. 

This girl is super freaky and I just want to have fun without disappointing either of us. (By freaky I mean calling me Daddy, spanking, wanting to be tied up etc) Any advice?


Update: it went perfectly. I was nervous about having sex and performing but swallowed that and we ended up having sex like 8-9 times with breaks in between to talk and laugh. I didn't end up jerking off before but it worked out anyway. Took me a good 15m to cum the first time which was a bit frustrating. 

When she first arrived I showed her my hobby, around the place until we ended up in my bedroom where it just happened. she complimented how clean my bathroom and how organized my room was and how good I smelled so that was really nice. In total it was around 5 hours before she had to leave, but definitely going to be doing this again. Thanks for the advice everyone. "

"How do you deal with your girlfriend being hit on constantly?


I've been dating this girl for about 2 months now, and I truly am enjoying every second of it. I consider myself a good looking guy, muscular build, above average height etc. I've never felt this way before but the girl I'm dating is way out of my league, as funny as that sounds. She's tall, insanely fit, used to model professionally before she got her doctorates, even used to be a cheerleader for the Miami dolphins. (Now she has her doctorates and is a physical therapist) 

I know what you're thinking, ""dude you scored big time, just enjoy it"" I am definitely enjoying it, but my issue is my girl gets hit on about 5 times an hour, around the clock. 

I've talked to her about it, she tells me she's used to it and it won't ever change her mind about me. 

But, I've only had 2 really serious relationships before this, and both girls cheated. So, as you can imagine, insecurity is a flaw I've definitely acquired. 

I try to ignore it on a daily basis, but it's like I have to be holding her in someway for guys to chill out, if I step away to use the bathroom or something, almost guaranteed someone will be trying to hit on her. It becomes frustrating after the hundredth time.

I trust her, and maybe this is just what it's like dating someone extremely attractive in a major city, but I really do see this relationship moving to the next level, and I just want to make sure I can learn to handle this for the long haul. She's perfection in my eyes so I don't want to mess this one up. 

So guys, has anyone dealt with this and do you have any tips? "
