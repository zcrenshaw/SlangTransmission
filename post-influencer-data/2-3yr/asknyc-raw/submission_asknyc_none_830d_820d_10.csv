0,"What can I do as an NYC citizen to put pressure on government officials to improve our wayward subways?


More often than not, like many of you, I experience absurd delays getting around the city. Whether it's complete shutdowns of subway lines, ""signal problems"", etc...I feel this really needs more attention.

It helps papers like NYT are covering this issue more and more (see [here](https://nyti.ms/2rP2RBo)), but as a concerned citizen I would like to be more vocal about this issue.

While there is a lot of blame to go around, from what I understand a lot of this problem falls on Cuomo continually raiding the MTA budget. What other government officials should be held accountable for the gravity of the subway failures today? And what is the recommended way of letting them know this is not ok (phone calls, emails, etc)? "
