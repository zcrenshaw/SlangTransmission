0,"Why does NYC has a very few public toilets? Where do you guys pee when you're out in the city?


First time tourist in NYC and when I'm out in the city, usually wandering through avenues and streets, I really struggle to find any public toilet except in Central Park. Why is that?  
 
Do you guys usually go to nearby random store for peeing? "
1,"One day left in the city before I go back to a shitty situation. What can I do to make it the best ever? Thanks for everything !


First off, I wanna say thanks to every single New Yorker out there. You guys are fucking awesome and NYC is the greatest city of all time even though I've only spent like a week here. 

 Special thanks to the ones who made the sidebar the most helpful and informative place to learn what to do, also to the MTA who run my favorite way to travel so efficiently. The subway system has blown me away at how good it is. I only got lost a couple times but there were always people to help me out. Also much thanks to the girl who helped me out in getting some stuff I was really nervous about. 


 It's been a crazy week for me. I got out of my comfort zone for the first time in my life and I walked. I walked SO MUCH, I've never walked this much in my life and it does wonders for my mood. I've never felt so safe in this city than anywhere else. Granted I didn't go to any shady places, but still, I hardly ever felt safe where I'm from. 

Just walking around the city, taking in the sights, the brick buildings, the graffiti, the street performers, all the other people. And no one cares if you're different either.

The city is absolutely gorgeous. Greenwood Cemetery was such a calming walk.

The museums are mind blowing, I've never been to anything as fantastic as the Met or the Natural History Museum.

I also went to the MoMa and the Guggenheim, and while modern art isn't really my thing, I still enjoyed the heck out of them.

 The Nutcracker at Brookfield Place, oh God so beautiful and magical. I've always wanted to see ballet and plays, and it was everything I'd imagined it would be. I went to see it twice. Also, it rekindled my interest in learning to ballet someday. 

I had pizzas from Bleeker Street Pizza, Joe's, and NY Pizza Suprema.  All of them were awesome but I feel like the Nonna Maria from Bleeker's is my favorite.


I also walked the High Line, it was a very nice walk, plus that underwear dude statue and that poem by Zoe Leonard made it so much better. 

Anyway, tomorrow will be my last full day, have to catch a flight the day after. I really wanna make it as special as possible. I'm already dreading going back home but I'll always have the memories at least.

I'm thinking of walking across the Brooklyn Bridge at night for the finale, but other than that I'm not sure. Not sure if I can afford to go to the Top of the Rock or Empire State Building. 

I've been pretty lonely and depressed as fuck, so this week was the best of my life.

TL; DR: I fucking love you all. Now help me make the last day the best ever.


Once again, thank you for everything, thank you for making this city such a wonderful place. 

I hope I can one day come and live here."

Looks like an amazing experience but that price tag is hefty..
