0,"What tours should ""a local"" take?


I want to learn more about the city but don't want to fall into a tourist trap. What are some good tours for someone that lives here?"
1,"What are some NYC deals on Groupon (or any deals-sites) that you think are actually worth it?


Lots of deals out there, and there are a lot of hits &amp; misses. Which ones do you think are best?"
2,"Where to take a nap in Manhattan?


Is there anyplace I can go just to lay down for a 15 minute power nap? I work in Midtown.

I don't want a massage or anything, just lay down and close eyes for 15 mins after lunch. That would be stellar."
3,"I found an annual metrocard and I'm looking for its owner.


Today this guy was pulling some stuff out of his pocket and he dropped his card, by the time I noticed and picked it up he had already swiped with a different card and was far gone as I was leaving and he was just going down. I tried calling him but he had headphones on and didn't listen. So if you lost an annual metrocard today, let me know. You have to prove it's you btw by mentioning which station this happened and time. "
