1,"At my wits end with group of hostile, alcoholic/drug-addicted homeless living in front of my apartment building. NYPD and 311 are not helping anymore. Where can I go?


I've lived in my neighborhood in Brooklyn going on two years now and directly across the street from my apartment building lies a group of regular homeless who seem to have occupied the corner of the intersection. They set up one of those street market things where they sell furniture, books, movies, and music likely taken from trash. For a while we were fine with it because it didn't bother us. They did their thing and were quiet about it. 

However, this summer things have escalated greatly. Their inventory has tripled in size, as well as their ""employees"". They line up lawn chairs along the sidewalk where they sit and drink and openly snort cocaine all day. By mid day, they become violent with one another. Usually they just verbally argue, screaming in each other's faces but sometimes punches are thrown and furniture (like brooms) are used to fight with. The cat-calling and sexual harassment is out of control as well. My girlfriend was called and told ""pull down your pants so I can fuck you"" by four men while she went out to get groceries in the middle of the day. I called NYPD and they simply told one of them to leave and took a harassment report. 

I report weekly on 311's online reporting tool as illegal vending and explain all that I've said above, and the case is closed by my NYPD pct saying ""Not a 311 complaint."" When I call the NYPD to follow up and see where I can take this complaint, the line is always busy and I can't get through. I also report it as dirty sidewalk conditions on 311 which gets forwarded to the department of sanitation, who also closes the case saying ""No violation found."" 

What is going on here? Does the city not care about the safety of the neighborhood that much? Am I crazy for thinking this is insane? We feel so unsafe just walking out in the middle of the day now and nobody cares to help. What can I do now?

Edit: thanks everyone for your replies. I've sent a mildly edited version of this post to my councilman on Facebook. I also plan on attending the council meeting at the end of the month and bringing my issues to the table. "
