Spending time in Times Square?

Do you secretly love comedy despite always saying no?

Spending 20 dollars on a cup of coffee?

My biggest GP is Chevy's in Times Square. Used my fake id there for the first time as a kid and got drunk for the first time. It's stupid and has food literally made out of shit. But it holds so many memories.

I would never tell my friends though, I make such a big deal about not going to food franchises.

Whats yours?
