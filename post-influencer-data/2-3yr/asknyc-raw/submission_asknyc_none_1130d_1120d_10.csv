I am 28/F, living in the LES. I don't even know where to begin to search for an AA meeting spot for newcomers. I am too embarrassed to ask anyone I know. I can attend the meetings after 5pm on weekdays.  I do not crave drinking everyday, but when I do drink I definitely binge and black out. I don't know if there is a certain group meeting to attend for this type of problem. Any information can help."
1,"[Serious] Can anyone recommend a pro domme?


Visiting NYC from Australia in October and would like to session with a pro domme.


Have done it once before at Pandora's Box in I think Chelsea. It was ok; I loved the Mistress I was with (Della) but it was a different experience to what I'm used to. No shower before or after, very little discussion about what we were to do, etc.


Have found plenty of Dommes searching through Google but am looking for first had recommendations.


Thanks in advance."
2,"Has anyone been in the downtown 6 train last wednesday evening-ish?


I was on the downtown 6 train last Wednesday at around evening time (I think) when an incident happened at the 42nd st station. A black homeless man with hair like Frederick Douglas' wearing a big stained white T made a fuss about a woman whose leg was on his way as he was walking down the car. We didn't pay attention as you all know this city has its fair share of crazy people. He walked to the next car down the line and some 3 minutes later, people from that car started pouring through the door and one woman was yelling for help. It all happened fast and there was this flurry of desperation, so I didn't get a chance to learn what was the trouble, but I'm certain it involved the homeless man who was in our car. 

Now, I am really curious as to what happened.

I know this is a bit of a stretch but have any of you been there at that time and witnessed the ordeal? Could you describe what happened for curiosity's sake? I tried googling keywords in hopes of finding the story in the news but I've had no luck so far."
