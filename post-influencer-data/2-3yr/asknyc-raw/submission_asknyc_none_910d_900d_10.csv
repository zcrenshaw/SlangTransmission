0,"Anyone working during this blizzard?


Boss made me promise to come into work today. State of emergency declared. 3/4 of the staff is not coming in, including my boss. No trains are running back out to where I live.  

Furious doesn't even begin to describe my feelings."
1,"I just wanted to thank /r/AskNYC for your help!


I asked you guys for some advice for a short weekend trip to NYC in Feb and the tips I received from you guys were spot on and I enjoyed my weekend in NYC thoroughly! Thanks a lot.  New York also delivered the best weather for the weekend I was there, it was 18Â°C and I was in a t-shirt mid Feb.

I haven't uploaded all photos yet but here are some photos I took while I was there: https://www.flickr.com/photos/131377301@N07/shares/Wj1g48

Thanks again!"

I only know what I've seen in movies and on tv so I want to know how it really was compared to 2017. "
