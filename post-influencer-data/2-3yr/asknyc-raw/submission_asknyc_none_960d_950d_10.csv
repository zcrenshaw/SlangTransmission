0,"Are there any politically active groups that need people with tech skills in NYC?


Hi all - after seeing pictures yesterday of the lawyers assembled at JFK helping with the immigration issues, I've been thinking a lot about how I can become more politically involved myself. As much as I'd like to join in the protests, etc., I feel like my skills may be better suited for a different kind of effort. I'm a tech person, skilled in programming, hosting websites, setting up servers, devops, security, crypto, etc.

I'd love to lend these skills to organizations that need them, but am having a hard time finding a place to do so. Are there any groups, subreddits, meetups, etc. where I can go to help?"
1,"Why don't people like De Blasio?


I've lived here a few years. 
I have the general sense I'm not supposed to like De Blasio, but I never hear actual reasons why. 

Sure, people blame silly stuff on him (jackhammers outside their windows at night), but what is some stuff he's done that's actually bad? 

Seems like the only things he's touched that effect me (rent increase hike...new subways) have been good.

Is this a case of him being an actually bad mayor, or just that no one ever likes the mayor because they're the most public face of the city?

Also, does he love horses or hate horses? Because I'm also confused about that."
