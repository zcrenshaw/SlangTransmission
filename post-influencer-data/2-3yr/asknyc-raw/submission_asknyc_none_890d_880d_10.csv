0,"I’m mapping the best r/AskNYC threads.


Hey guys, I’ve been mapping some of my favorite r/AskNYC threads and I thought I would share. It’s updated so any restaurants that have closed won’t be on the map. And each map links right back to the reddit thread. 

Here are the one’s I’ve done so far.

Ultimate Cheap Eats Thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/4yjmmf/serious_ultimate_cheap_eats_thread_share_your/)

I used #ultimatecheapeats for this one.

Just wanted to give a quick shout out to

/u/sokpuppet1,
/u/paratactical and
/u/ilysespieces 


I didn't realize it was a privilege to have active, well informed mods that listen to the community.  Boyyyyy was I wrong.

Thanks for keeping the sub healthy and updated. Mad appreciated."
