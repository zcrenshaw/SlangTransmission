0,"Anyone ever ask someone to stop playing their music over their shitty, tinny cell-phone? Is the frequency of this increasing?


It seems like more and more, on the subway, I have to listen to someone's terrible autotuned, garbage-music blaring out their cell phone speaker, as they mumble along like a goddamn idiot. What the fuck is wrong with these people? Has anyone ever tried just yelling at them as they exit the car, or politely approaching them during the ride? (Good way to get into a fight, I presume) I would love to see groups of people all play their music simultaneously in response to a cellphone-blarer to demonstrate how annoying it is.  Fire with fire and all that. Any thoughts or stories?"
1,"Psychotic man punched me in the head on the subway. Wtf NYC?


I'm coming home from work last night (a hospital) - 830pm on the A train going Into Manhattan from Brooklyn. Im wearing my scrubs, sitting in the seat right next to the door. A smelly, psychotic, homeless-appearing dude walks in and sits across from me- you know the type that talk to themselves really loudly?

He was saying ""fuck that doctor, fuck him, I'll fuck him up. fuck psychiatrists telling me what to do. what you say to me? I'll fuck your shit up bitch""

Over and over again in different variations.

I'm not a psychiatrist.

I'm just sitting there quietly looking down at my phone, but vigilant now and on my guard. I figured I'm only getting off in a few stops, no need to move. This guy is just like ALL the other psychos and if you don't make eye contact nothing will happen.

Then he got up to get off- I looked up to keep him in my peripheral vision as he's still talking about how he's going to fuck me up.

As he's walking by me to the door he swings his fist directly at my head, but I see it in my periphery and tilt my head super fast and simultaneously knock his arm away, so he only barely sideswiped me and then he walked out the door and it closed.

Reflexes saved me last night but wow what a crazy thing to happen. Just what I needed after a 12 hour shift in the ER.

In retrospect I could have gotten up, but I didn't think it would happen.

BE VIGILANT PEOPLE!

Violent, psychotic people exist and you need to be careful.

P.S. if he stayed on and I knocked him out after he hit me, would that be worse for me?"
2,"Where can I get legit bowls of pho and ramen in this city?


I realize these are very different asks, but ramen and pho were 2 of my favorite things about living in San Francisco. There were a million places to grab an $8 bowl of pho in the Tenderloin, specifically the Little Saigon neighborhood, and even San Francisco's middle-tier ramen restaurants seem to be better than NYC's ""best."" 

So, residents of NYC, where can I find great pho tai and tonkutsu ramen in your city? I've tried a lot of the top rated places on Yelp but they've all been mediocre to bad so far.      

Edit: Grammar. "
