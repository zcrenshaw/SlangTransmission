0,"Question about jews?


I have two questions about this jewish guy I saw the other day at a supermarket in Queens buying fruit. But he wasnt buying apples and oranges he had all these exotic fruits, the only thing I recognized was a dragon fruit and pomegranate but there all these other funky fruits. I knew he was jewish because he had the beard and hair side things that hasidim have but I was confuesed because he dressed like a normal person also the cashier asked him if he was jewish and he said yes and I overheard him saying something about a jewish holiday this week and thats why he was buying all the werid fruits. 

So my questions are

1. are there jews who have the beard and stuff like hasidim but dont dress like them in the black coats and stuff? what are they called?

2. what were all the fancy fruits for?

I rather ask here then on the jewish subreddit because i dont want to offend anyone for whatever reason"
1,"A Reminder: Be Polite


Not every post requires a sarcastic response. Not gonna call anyone out. 

Remember-- some people posting questions on this sub might be kids, might have social issues, might just be completely helpless. Treat them like you'd treat any other differently-abled person.

Low effort questions are annoying and I'm as guilty as anyone else for sometimes being a dick. But sometimes it's better to just not respond then to drive people away. If a question is truly out of line, report it and if enough people agree, it will magically disappear.

By all means, be who you are. Just keep in mind that not everybody who asks a question here is trying to personally offend you.

Thanks!"
2,"Japanese Intern in the NYC here, Can I ask the New York City Subway clerk for a late slip or any similar thing?


So, I'm a Japanese guy currently in NYC for a paid internship. I use the New York City Subway for my daily commute to work and as you might be aware, how frequently the train gets delayed. I feel pretty bad and cringe-worthy when I always have to give the excuse of train delay at my work for being late.  
 
Back in my country, trains rarely get late, and if it is, the clerk gives you a late slip basically which shows that you were late because of train delay. 
 
Can I ask for any similar thing to the New York City Subway clerk? Would he/she even give anything like that?"
