0,"Oyster meetup yo


Because I've received a few PM's on it, to all those interested we'll be having an oyster meetup this coming Saturday at ten bells on the LES. Happy hour is 3pm-7pm dollar oysters from 3 different regions, half priced wine carafes and some beer special. Once again I will be making a new post the day of, hope to see some of you that messaged me last week.


NOTE: after 6pm I will likely be blind drunk and no longer responding to PM's or text messages."
