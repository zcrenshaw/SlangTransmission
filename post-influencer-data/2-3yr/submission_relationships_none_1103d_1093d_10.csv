"I [28f] literally just found email after email from my fiancé [27m] to his ex girlfriend [20s/f] belittling me and making fun of me and worse. I am seriously shocked beyond belief.


Link to my update post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52r6o3/update_i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after/

My fiancé, ""Dale"", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.

Dale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.

I used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line ""Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...""

The subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. ""Jen"" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.

Rest of the subject line was ""Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?""

The email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.

Even worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like ""she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it."" And then she answered with a bunch of ""lol""s and said she felt sorry for the ""poor girl"". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. 

That is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of ""if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.""

But to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.

The emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.

Obviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses ""backdoor"". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.

I'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.

I'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now.

**tl;dr** fiancé made fun of me and sent explicit emails to his ex. Just found them. Heartbroken, angry, hurt, every emotion ever going on. Don't know if I should just ghost him and never see him again or confront him? I need nice words from Internet strangers or something right now."

"My [25F] dogs [5F German Sheppard &amp; 3M Rottweiler] has started to growl at my boyfriend [27M] anytime he comes near my son [4M]


Earlier in my relationship my dogs loved my boyfriend, he would play with them, he would take them for walks but recently they hate him. It's like if he comes near my son they are fully prepared to take a chunk out of him. My dogs have never had a problem with anyone, people always comment how gentle they are. 

My boyfriend does not live with us and he babysits brad sometimes when I am at work. 

This started two weeks he came over for dinner and the moment he walked into Brads room they ran up the stairs, ran right past me and into his room. The were showing their teeth, growling, barked when he tried to enter the room. 

This was so unlike them, I have never seen them angry before this and they did not stop until he was out of sight. They don't do this with anyone else, even brad friends father was here the other day and they were perfectly friendly with him. They have never met the man before. 

Every time my boyfriend is here they both sit with brad, if my boyfriend even walks past the room the growl. The dogs love brad really I have never had a problem, they carry his toys to him. They always want us to play 

They never have a problem with me coming near brad, they always want me to play with them. If they see me playing with brad they just go back to sleep.  It's literally only my boyfriend 

Am I right to think something is up and he did something to brad? 

tl;dr: Dogs hate boyfriend all of a sudden and won't let him come near brad (my son). 

**Edit Hi, yeah so the dogs were right.
My boyfriend basically broke up with me when I confronted him about it, he basically said he gave brad a ""light"" tap on his hand and the dogs freaked out when he did it. I finally got the truth out of him after he continued to lie, half the things he said made no sense. I am sure the light tap is bullshit and he hit him hard
He broke up with me, but honestly I can't say I am sad that he is out of my life**"
"My [25/F] MIL [50s/F] walked in on my husband [28/M] and I having sex, and now she keeps directing these weird remarks at me.


We've been together three years, married three months. His family invited us to join them on a trip. Our first day there, SO and I decided to have a quickie before dinner. 

We gave his mother a spare key card to our room just in case, but we did not expect her to use it. I guess we were running late for dinner. She came up to see what was taking so long, tried to open the door, unlocked it on her own (even though we put the do not disturb thing up) and caught us. She stared for a second and then ran out embarrassed. My husband and I burst out laughing. He closed the door, we finished ~~because we're monsters~~ and went down to dinner expecting some awkward laughter and a joke or two. 

MIL usually makes the innocent sex joke here and there so we didn't expect her to be traumatized or anything. But she has really made a point to direct weird, shameful remarks at me. Implying I'm a *hussy* for fucking my husband, while conveniently ignoring the fact that she ignored all the signs and unlocked the door on her own. 

SO has tried to talk to her but she ""can't look at him"". The rest of the family has no idea what happened. 

TL;DR: on family trip. SO were having sex in our hotel room. MIL has spare key. She unlocked the door and walked in on us. Now she keeps trying to make me feel bad for having sex with my husband. "
"My [26F] husband [25M] cheated on me in our home, while he was suppose to be looking after our son [3M].


My husband and I have been together five years and we have two children 3M and 2F. Last week I was taking my daughter to the doctor and I was going to bring my son along. My husband told me not to worry about it and he would look after him. Once we were done at the doctor I went to go visit my sister for a little bit with my daughter. 

Both our children are perfectly healthy, my daughter just had this cough that kept getting worse so I took her to the doctor. She's getting better now. But last night I got a E-Mail from a woman yesterday evening. I had just put the kids to bed and I was working. 

The title read ""Concern over your son"" It caught my eye, because I was thinking who is this and why is she talking about my kid. This woman Ember [fake name] claimed to know my husband. Not only that she claimed to be sleeping with my husband and that they were in love. 

She messaged me to tell me that she was over at my house last week. The day I took my daughter to the doctor, she even mentioned this in the Email. She told me my son was wondering around while my husband and I quote ""fucked my brains out in your bed"" She told me to take my son with me when I go out so they can have some privacy. The things I wanted to do to her when I read it, hell would reserve a special section just for me. 

I was furious and I asked my husband who was watching TV who is Ember. The look on his face said it all, you could just tell his heart sank and he was shitting himself. He was stuttering, and was telling me she's nobody. A long argument later he told me to ""go fuck myself and left""

He called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason.

I don't know what to do next, I am still in shock, I'm angry, I need some guidance. I did so much for him I earned more money than him, I payed for almost anything that loser did. I work in marketing for a major company and he is unemployed mechanic

tl;dr: Husband cheated on me when son was home and has left me . I need guidance of what to do next "
"Me [23M] with my GF [23F]. She was pregnant and people were telling me to prepare for the worst. Turns out they were just assholes.


Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zprmp/me_23m_with_my_gf_23f_shes_pregnant_and_people/

Edit: I'm totally telling my baby about how her story got a gift from a kind stranger tonight. Thank you for the gold. 


Edit 2: I guess I should clarify that Nita and I are not out of friends completely, and that the comments our other 'friends' were making all the time wasn't friendly advice to prepare ourselfves in case something went wrong. Some of them heard 'pre-eclampsia' and decided either my gf or my baby would die, or I'd certainly lose them both. I freaked out, even with our doctor's words ringing through my mind that Nita was fine. It was brutal to consider the possibility I could lose my girls, especially when there was no need to consider that. Then, when things were over, the same people who were so sure of death were suddenly sure that my gf and baby would pull through no matter what. That hurt and pissed me off, not to mention how much it hurt Nita who didn't need to go through any more stress. 

---
I guess the reason I was freaking out so much in my last post was because I knew something was going to happen.

Nah, I'm kidding, I was just freaking out. But 4 days after that post, Nita's water broke. She didn't even need to be induced, our baby just decided she wanted out already. We were tense and scared but everything went well and now we're the parents of a healthy baby girl. Nita's health is also good and her mood has improved drastically because she can finally let go of that bed rest rule.

Our baby is sweet and tiny and loud and holding her for the first time was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced. We've been adjusting to parenthood ever since and it's been great. Baby cries a lot and I know the crying will eventually drive us a little crazy, but for now I'm just happy my baby has lungs strong enough to wake up the entire neighbourhood.

A few of our ''friends'' have called, wanting to check up on Nita and the baby. One of them told me they just knew everything would be alright, and I couldn't help myself then and said that his previous words to me on Nita's pregnancy had been: 'shit, man, you gotta be strong 'cause this is probably gonna end badly'. I told him to fuck off and leave me and my girls alone.

So, this is it, I guess. I wanted to update because you guys were really good to us, and calmed us down. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone back then, but I appreciate all the advice and responses. You guys shared yours stories with us, and it meant a lot, be sure of that.

tl;dr: Turns out I was freaking out for no reason. My girls are strong as hell and are doing more than fine. Thanks for the help, everyone."
"My best friend/best man [24m] stole a wedding idea from me [23m]. My wedding is in a little over a week and I'm freaking out. Am I being petty?


Kyle and I have been best friends since junior high. I'm not going to go into massive detail about our friendship, but he's really important to me and we've been through a lot together.

Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and Kyle and I both get engaged around the same time to two wonderful women. It's been really fun planning a wedding with another couple and my fiance, Kacie, and I love having them around.

Now, Kacie is a bit of a control freak. She has mostly had final say on everything in the wedding, not that I'm complaining. She has better taste than me and the wedding is going to be really beautiful thanks to her.

The one thing she has let me have complete control over is the first dance. I was ecstatic. I really wanted to show her how much she means to me with this dance. I picked out Peter Gabriel's ""The Book of Love"" and edited a video of pictures of her and I growing up, meeting, and falling in love. And then I commissioned an artsy friend of mine to make a literal Book of Love with all our pictures in them. I've cried every time watching it. The whole thing is going to be a huge surprise for her.

The only other person who knew about this was Kyle. He kept saying how cool it was I was doing this and how he wished he'd thought of something like it.

Kyle's wedding was this weekend. And holy shit, their first dance was to Book of Love and he edited a video of their baby pictures and their relationship. My heart fucking sank like a brick. He wouldn't talk to me during the reception and hasn't responded back to any of my texts.

What the hell do I do? I can't go through with my plan. Our social circles intertwine and I'll look like I stole his idea. Should I just tell Kacie and have her help me with a new idea? Do I tell Kyle he's not welcome at my wedding? Or am I just being silly and just go ahead with my plan despite how I feel?

tl;dr--Best man stole my wedding idea a few days before my wedding."
"My [25F] fiance [25M] father [60'sM] sent me a dick pic and I am not sure how to proceed


I have been dating Buck for 4 years now we met in college, really amazing guy, good looking. His family mainly his sisters and mother [55F, 24F, 27F] have been really welcoming and really welcomed me and my mother &amp; sister into their family. They are a close family so we all live in the same city and they normally hang out every Saturday. I am pregnant with our first child. We both have our dream jobs and everything is fine apart from his father 

I get aggressively hit on by men when I go out, it's part of the reason why when I am in a relationship I rarely go out to bars or anything like that. If my friends want to hang out we normally go to the mall and even then some guys comes up and talks to us. I am not a cheater, I hate cheaters my father cheated on my mother and it tore my family apart. So I have gotten my fair share of unwanted dick pics is what I am trying to get at. So one thing I will never do is cheat on buck. 

Hi father and mother are divorced and 2 weeks ago I met his father for the first time. His father lives on the other side of the country in New York with his new wife. His father flew out to see his children and this was my first time meeting him in person. He seemed nice enough completely different from the rest of the family. He seemed really cold and to the point. 

We exchanged details just to you know, stay in contact because he is my fiance father. His father seemed rather closed off and he stated he hated leaving NY and hated people in general. Buck and his father are not close like he is to the rest of the family. They seem to only communicate because they are father and son. They just don't seem to really like each other. 

Over night I got a message on Facebook from him and it was a picture of him holding his dick, one flaccid and one erect. With the words after it ""You Like red?"" I have red hair so that's why he called me that. 

Buck is still sleeping and I am not sure how to address this with him and my friends will just cause a huge fucking drama, like they always do. I just need some advice please 

tl;dr: boyfriends father sent me a dick pick

"My [42F] nephew [20M] is telling everyone he has asthma like my son [12M] but he is just overweight. He stole 3 of my sons inhalers and he is refusing to pay for what he took.


My nephew is really overweight, like extremely big. I promise I don't mean to sound like a witch but he can't make it up the stairs without being short of breathe. 

Recently 3 of my sons inhalers went missing, my son asthma is bad. He has really bad asthma attacks from time to time. My husband, children and I hosted a party the night before. So we thought maybe someone threw them out by mistake while drunk. We searched for them but to no luck. 

Anyway my daughter [17F] heard from one of her cousins that Stewart has asthma. I called my sister and I asked if this was true and she said it is the first time she is hearing of it. She went into his room and she found my sons inhalers. Her son still lives at home and is not doing anything with his life. No college, no job, nothing. 

You can tell they are my sons Asters because we have stickers on them. His little sister who is 7 put smiley faces on them because she believes it helps. My sister confronted him about it and he cam clean. He stole the inhaler and pretended to have asthma so people would not think he is out of shape. 

I know he has no job, but those things are not cheap and honestly I am furious. I think he should pay for what he used because really 2 of them are broken. My sister does not think she should pay for them if he can't and is asking me to cut him a break. 

I don't think I should, but I don't know what to do. This is really tearing a rift between myself and my sister. But at the same time it's like he stole my little boys inhalers, that to my is unforgivable. 

tl;dr: Nephew stole sons inhalers "
"My (26M) girlfriend (27F) thinks she has body dysmorphia... she's just overweight. I don't know what to do.


Been with Stephanie (name changed for privacy) for a little over 3 years. More or less relationship is good, she tends to be way overdramatic when we fight (which isn't often) but I can usually talk her down and things work out. 

When Stephanie and I first started dating she mentioned a few times in kind of a mysterious (I thought it was attention-seeking, still do) way that she had some kind of mental illness or mental health struggle. Eventually (probably two or three months in) she came out and told me in a really serious conversation that she has body dysmorphia and thinks she's obese and hates herself for it. 

Now let me be clear, I love her the way she is, wouldn't change a thing, I don't mind her weight whatsoever. But even when she said it initially, I almost thought it was a joke. Stephanie is obese. I'm not good at guessing weight and she's never told me her weight, but I know she's 5'4 and a size 22 in pants (US). She's by all standards obese. I don't mind it at all. I'm attracted to her, I think she's beautiful, I would never ask her to change a thing.

It didn't come up again for a while but last fall she took a psychology course for her college degree and they talked about mental illness and it came back up. She came in one night almost happy? in a weird way, saying that she understands everything that's wrong with her because they talked about BD in class and it all makes sense. She has never been diagnosed by a medical professional and can't see a doctor for lack of health insurance. 

Ever since then, she talks about it a lot. I'm not one to poke at people just to poke, so I just let it be. But she talks about it all the time. She blames arguments we have on her BD. She uses it as an excuse to eat poorly and not take care of herself, because she is straight up convinced that she is smaller than she is and that the person she sees in the mirror is a dysmorphic situation. She is part of an online BD support group and talks openly to me about how she's met people who finally understand her, and she gives them advice and guidance based on her ""struggle"" with BD. She's pointed to actresses like Mindy Kalling and compared the actress's body to her ""actual"" body (vs. BD body) and says it's nice to see herself represented on screen. No offense intended to my girlfriend, but that's not her body type. She is much bigger than that.

I'm getting to the point where I don't know what to do. She uses it as an excuse for all her behavior. I honestly don't know if she truly thinks she has BD or if she just uses it to justify herself. When we first moved in together, she would cover all the sizes on the tags of her clothes with Sharpie so I wouldn't see them. She's since stopped doing that (or only does it when she remembers), but it made me think she might be aware of her size and just tries to pretend she has BD so no one can talk to her about it.

I know this is a weird situation. I'd like to get her or us into counseling but she doesn't have insurance and goes to a community college that doesn't offer student mental health services. I'm not sure what to do. 

TL;DR Girlfriend uses body dysmorphia as an excuse for everything, but she's not dysmorphic, she's just overweight. "
"I [26F] won a trip to Disney World. My cousin [30F] thinks I should take her daughter [5F] but I don't want to.


I recently won an all-expense paid trip to Disney World for four nights, for myself and three guests. I am currently planning on bringing my boyfriend [30M] , my mother [54F], and my boyfriend's mother [50sF]. I know we all aren't exactly Disney's key demographic, but it honestly means a lot to our mothers that I am inviting them. Both my boyfriend and I grew up in poorer families that could never afford expensive vacations, and this is the first trip to Disney World for all of us. I know this is probably the only opportunity our mothers will ever have to go to Disney, and for now they are both in good enough health to still enjoy the rides.


The problem is with my cousin, Jane [30F], who has been hounding me to take her 5-year-old daughter, Kelly, instead of my boyfriend's mother. I know, I know, what kind of monster am I for not wanting to bring a little girl to the place where dreams come true?! Except Jane's family has already been to Disney World twice, most recently earlier this year in February. My cousin has done very well for herself - she runs a successful photography business, and her husband is an engineer. They are definitely able to afford their own vacations. If Jane wasn't so well off, I probably would consider taking Kelly if I thought I was giving a little kid a once in a lifetime experience. But I'm not. She's already been twice and she's only five! Our mothers have been ZERO times. Jane's only rationale for wanting me to take her daughter seems to be that ""Disney is meant for kids. It's weird to go with only adults."" and ""It'd be evil to not take a 5 year old to Disney if you had the chance."" 


There's also the issue of Kelly herself. She's not a completely terrible child, but she's whiny and throws tantrums regularly. I don't really want to spend a week with that. Also, what if she gets homesick, what if she gets actually sick, what if she gets lost?! I'm not a parent myself and I would have no idea what to do in those situations. I also don't want to saddle my mother with the responsibility of caring for her. I've babysat Kelly before, but only for a few hours at a time. I'm not sure why my cousin is even comfortable with the idea of me taking her child three states away.  We are in North Carolina, so it's not like Orlando is just a short drive down the road if something happens. 


I tried telling Jane I'm not comfortable bringing Kelly, and she just said this is a good opportunity to find out what being a parent is like. What?! She's almost acting like I'm not serious about not bringing Kelly, and I'm just pretending I don't want to bring her. It's really weird. Jane and I have always been very close, like we are sisters, and I'm afraid this has the potential to ruin our relationship once it comes to a head. What is the best way to tell her no without sounding like an evil child hater, or am I being selfish for not taking a kid to Disney?


TL;DR: I won a trip to Disney World, cousin wants me to bring her spoiled young daughter instead of boyfriend's mother and I don't want to."
"My sister [32] and her husband [30] are getting evicted from their apartment, and my mom [65] and dad [67] thinks that I [40M] should let them live in my beach house for free




I’m a successful engineer and architect. Did it on my own, no help from parents. I moved from their house at eighteen and lived on my own, and paid for my own things ever since. Paid for my own college with loans, and paid those all back with my own job.


Sister was different. They spoiled her. She was the baby. My dad was earning more money by the time she was born and since I was out of the house they had more money to buy her whatever she wanted, including a thirty thousand dollar wedding when she was 22, to a guy two years younger than her who never went to college. She went to college for a degree in fashion and did a grand total of nothing with it. 


Her husband has always been spotty with employment, and my parents are always bailing him and my sister out because his own parents are dead or don’t talk to him. He’s supposed to be a professional DJ.


Anyway I have a large apartment in the city where I live with my wife [39] and daughter [4]. I own a small beach condo (two bedrooms). My family usually goes there when the weather is good.


My sister and her husband are getting thrown out of their apartment because both of them are deadbeats.


My mom and dad are I guess tired of giving them money because now my mom is telling me I should either give my sister money or let her and her husband live in my beach house rent free.


I don’t want them to live in my beach house, and told my mother as much. My mom says I’m being cruel and selfish.


What’s “cruel and selfish” I think is the fact that mom and dad live in a three bedroom house and haven’t invited sister and her husband to live with them but are putting it on me.


My wife is being nice about it and telling me to do what’s right but I can tell she will miss visiting the beach house.


Plus I think that once my sister and her worthless husband get in, they will never leave.


My parents are telling me to “man up” and be a big brother.


Looking for advice on how to best handle this in a way that doesn’t let them have my beach house, but still isn’t cruel, and is helpful.



Tl;dr: sister and her husband want to live in my beach house for free. I say no. My mom says I’m mean. I say what’s mean is them not even spotting me five bucks for gas in college when they spent at least fifty thousand on my sister’s fashion AA at FIDM.

"My sister [26] is telling family members that my husband [31] is a ""bully"" because he embarrassed her wannabe MMA-fighter boyfriend [24] after the guy tried to show off his fighting prowess at my [32F] apartment


Sister's boyfriend is an aspiring MMA fighter. I think he is a middleweight. He also is a PX90 trainer and fitness coach. Stereotypical ""bro jock.""


My husband is a science teacher and NOT a jock. Though he happens to have a black belt in judo, which he doesn't go around telling people.


Sister and her boyfriend were watching football at our apartment last weekend. Talk turned to mixed martial arts, and my sister's boyfriend starts pontificating and humble bragging about how tough it is, and by extension how tough HE is. He goes on and on about how he is ""not a huge guy but can take down anyone,"" and that he has moves that are impossible to counter.


He's about the same height as my own husband (my husband is Japanese; sister's boyfriend is Irish-American) but much more muscular. My husband is fit but very slender. Anyway my husband innocently says that no move is really impossible to counter.


So, since his jock sensibilities were threatened, sister's boyfriend offers to demonstrate an unbreakable hold on my husband. My husband doesn't talk about judo with anyone and not even my sister knows he's a high-ranking expert, so her boyfriend tries to demonstrate the hold, and my husband easily breaks it.


So, he says he was going easy on my husband, and offers to try harder. My husband consents, and this time not only breaks the hold again, but counters the move and holds sister's boyfriend in a compromising, embarrassing position, and tells him to break the hold.


Sister's boyfriend is totally humiliated and eventually ""surrenders."" He is humble about it and shakes my husband's hand. Rest of the afternoon seemed to go just fine.


But later on Facebook my sister mentions to me that my husband was being a bully to her boyfriend. In fact my mom called me later and told me to tell my husband to stop showing off, and for him to stop messing with sister's boyfriend.


One would think my husband was stealing candy from children or something.


I texted my sister back and said that her boyfriend was the one bragging endlessly about what a badass he thinks he is, and out of nowhere challenges my husband to break an ""impossible"" hold, and so my husband humors him and does exactly that.


I personally think my sister is just butthurt because she knows my meek little husband would absolutely smack the shit out of her alpha dog if they had a fight, and she's processing it all like an immature ten year old instead of moving on with her job of... Unemployed.


Then she went into a long spiel about how teachers are all corrupt (I'm a teacher too, for history) and just collecting paychecks and doing a lousy job, and how I think that now that I married a foreign person I think I'm exotic now.


Ouch. Tell me what you really think, sis!


I told her that she was acting like some of the middle school kids at mine and my husband's work. Now she's saying that I'm bullying HER by saying that.


But is it true? Was my husband being a bully? It seemed like the other guy had a sporting attitude about being beaten, so I don't get why sister is so mad.
  

I realize she's proud of her boyfriend being fit or being a cage fighter or whatever but she should know that one shouldn't go around trying to act like you're tougher than everyone else, because eventually someone will check you.

"My husband [32M] drunkenly let slip that he ""knows"" I [30F] cheated years ago and is okay with it. I never cheated.


My husband Derek and I have been married for 3 years, together for 7 total. 

Several years ago (about 6 now, I guess), I worked closely with a male coworker, Paul, that Derek was never fond of. Paul and I *never* had an inappropriate relationship. Derek's jealousy wasn't completely out of nowhere, I get why he felt that way. Those couple years were a perfect storm of relationship stress; I was working long hours, we were living apart after trying and failing to move in together, our relationship was still *fairly* new, and then you add in a handsome coworker I had to spend long hours with and saw more than my boyfriend at the time. 

Paul was the source of several fights. Again, we never did anything that wasn't completely kosher. Eventually I told Derek he needed to trust me and get over it, or we were going to have to break up. He said he would stop worrying, and for the most part things were good. When Paul transferred out of state a few months later, things were really good. There were no worries at all and our relationship has been amazingly strong ever since. 

This last weekend, my husband went out with a couple friends to some bars and a football game. When he came home, he was pretty wasted. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned how a friend of his had told him that he broke up with his girlfriend because she cheated on him. I commented on how that was a bummer and good for him for finding out before they got too serious. Derek, however, had a different take on it. He said it was a shame because they had seemed like a good couple and if they really loved each other his friend could move past the cheating, just like he had with me.

At first I thought my husband was admitting to cheating on me, and asked him what he meant. He told me he always knew that Paul and I had slept together ""at least once"" all those years ago, but he knew I was the one for him and forgave me. 

I told Derek that I had never so much as even hugged Paul (except maybe at his going away party), let alone slept with him. Derek sort of just patted me on the arm, said ""Of course"", and passed out. The next morning I asked him about the conversation and he said it was okay, he had forgiven me, it wasn't even an issue. I again stressed that I had never cheated on him with anybody and I needed him to believe me. He sort of did the same ""Of course you didn't, babe *wink*"" thing again and went to work.

Every time I've tried to talk to him since, he won't hear me out. I'm this close to losing it with him. I need him to know that I never cheated, and I'm hurt that he thinks I would do something like that. What do I do? Do I just let him have this since it's not really hurting anything, or what? I don't want my own husband to think so little of me that he thinks I would cheat. That's not who I am.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My husband is convinced that he forgave me for cheating near the beginning of our relationship. Problem is, I never cheated. I'm upset that he thinks so little of me and won't believe me when I say I didn't cheat."
"[UPDATE] My (26M) girlfriend (27F) thinks she has body dysmorphia... she's just overweight. I don't know what to do.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51gpbb/my_26m_girlfriend_27f_thinks_she_has_body/

------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, thanks to everyone who gave their opinions and advice. I really didn't expect my post to get much attention so I appreciate all the time people put in to offering me solutions to this issue.

After reading everything everyone said, and taking a few days to sleep on it, I finally decided to talk to Stephanie about the situation. A lot of people recommended that I straight up tell her she's overweight and she's not this thin person she thinks she is, but after really thinking about it, I felt that it wouldn't be beneficial to her mental health, no matter if she has BD or not, for me to do that. I felt it would be more appropriate for me to emphasize the parts of whatever is going on with her mental health that are negatively impacting our relationship and continue to push her to get help.

So that's what I did. I sat down with her Friday night and I told her that the issues she's struggling with mentally have become a barrier in our relationship. I explained to her that I felt that she sometimes stood behind her mental health problems as an excuse to not be a good partner, or to justify bad behavior that hurt me and our relationship. She wouldn't really acknowledge this at first but she eventually conceded that it's not fair to blame her behavior on any mental health issues and that she knows she uses it as a crutch because she gets embarrassed of the way she behaves. 

Then I talked to her about the BD. I explained to her that it feels to me like she is letting it define her as a person, and she lets her life revolve around it, and I don't feel that it's empowering her or helping her and I want her to get help. She told me that she feels her forum and personal research is help but I told her that this has been going on to some degree for our entire relationship and that just because she feels that she has discovered what is ""wrong"" with her doesn't mean she has fixed it. I told her that if she seriously feels that there is something wrong within her that is keeping her from being the person she wants to be, she needs to get help. 

Now, a lot of commenters felt that she didn't have BD (I'm still undecided) and that I needed to tell her she is just overweight. I was definitely not comfortable doing that. I don't think I am qualified to make a diagnosis and regardless of whether it is BD or it isn't, there is something wrong here and I am not capable of fixing it myself. 

So anyway. I told her all of that and we both cried. She told me she feels horrible for the way she has acted at times and she knows that it's not her, and this is why she brings up the BD in fights, because she doesn't want me to feel that the person she can be when we fight is who she truly is. I told her I know she isn't that person, but that since she isn't able to control herself when she gets that upset, she needs to talk to someone who can give her coping mechanisms.

We ended up looking into our county health resources for indigent people with no healthcare (her income qualifies her as indigent) and found two potential places in the area that offer low-cost mental health services to qualifying people. Stephanie texted me this morning (I'm at work) and told me she left a message for one of the facilities and she scheduled an intake appointment at another one of the facilities. The intake is free and then they discuss cost, payment plans, etc. when they make their ""treatment plan"". This suggestion from a commenter really saved our relationship, so thank you so much to everyone who suggested it.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel horrible that I came across in my post that there was nothing good about Stephanie or that I didn't respect or love her - I love her tremendously, and she is a great person who struggles with mental health issues, as many of us have in our lives. I believe she is committed to making a change, and I guess at the end of the day, whether or not she has BD isn't the biggest issue here, and making my post made me realize that. The biggest issue is that something is unwell with her mentally and she needs the proper treatment to feel better, and in turn be a better partner.

TL;DR We had a long talk and Stephanie agreed to get help. She made an appointment this morning for an intake appointment with a county resource for low-income people with no healthcare, and is going to pursue treatment. "
"UPDATE: My 28F husband 28M have been seeing a fertility doc to conceive-- just discovered that he had a vasectomy while we were trying. I am about to freak out.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/46tocd/my_28f_husband_28m_have_been_seeing_a_fertility/


Hey /r/relationships, sorry it took so long for an update, it has been a long road and a lot of you PM'd to ask how I was, which I really appreciate. I'm thankful for all of the great advice you gave and to the trolls who sent me nasty messages: fuck you.


On to the update:
So I confronted him about the aftercare instructions and at first he acted like he had no idea what they were or where they came from. I swear he acted like he had never heard the term 'vasectomy' before, which supremely pissed me off. After arguing about it for about 3 hours he finally admitted that he freaked out and got snipped because he had a horrible childhood and can't shake the feeling that he is going to screw up his own child. At this point I was beyond caring and wanted a divorce, and certainly didn't believe his reasons. He cried and kept FLIP FLOPPING ABOUT WANTING KIDS during the same argument, vasectomy and all. I couldn't take it and left to stay at a friend's house. I meant to speak with him again (and update you all) but honestly I was just devastated and I didn't end up speaking to him again until the end of march (this happened in feb) when I told him I would be seeking out a divorce. I couldn't justify staying with him when (a) my one true desire in life (motherhood) cannot be fulfilled with him, nor does he apparently even want to (i don't believe his excuse), and (b) he completely went against all transparency in our relationship instead of being honest. We didn't speak again until the end of may and to be honest I didn't even speak with a lawyer during that time because other than to go to work I barely got out of bed.


At the end of may he texted me a huge long message that essentially said that he was just scared and thought if I believed he was infertile he wouldn't have to own up to it and I wouldn't leave him. He said that after much soul searching he WANTS kids and always has (and this is evidenced to me by the fact that he LOVES kids and pays random babies way more attention than I do) but that he didn't want to lose his freedom just yet, didn't want our relationship to change, and felt a crushing sense of pressure when he thought about the fact that we are going to be shaping a human being's life. I agreed to meet up with him and we spent about 5 hours discussing the whole ordeal.


My birthday is June 24 and I pretty much didn't speak to him again after that last conversation except to say that what is done is done and I simply can't stay especially now that I can't trust him. On my birthday he asked if he could take me out for lunch. I was hesitant but said yes and essentially he had the reversal procedure done after our last talk and told me about it... on MY birthday. This actually really pissed me off and made me feel like he had no respect for my feelings. He begged for a second chance and said that he had all the time in the world to think about everything and that he let his fear get the better of him... which I can understand.


I still love this man despite everything and I can have empathy for his situation, but I just can't move past the lies. He was OK with letting my heart break thinking there was something wrong with me and that I might never get to be a mother. I also question whether or not he actually wants a baby or just me. Over the summer however he has shaped into Mr. Dad and sometimes he has me convinced that he really has made up his mind. We've been to the specialist who says that he's starting to present sperm in the vas deferens (a good sign this early after the reversal) but that it could be a year or two before fertility is where it needs to be to conceive.
Its really difficult for me to make up my mind at this point and choose between a relationship that has always been extremely strong and has had ONE event of betrayal that he is trying to fix (but that I still don't trust...) and moving on to somebody else who might not be as compatible with me otherwise. There is also the issue of bringing a baby into a mix when I'm not even sure that the baby is wanted...


So yeah. That's where everything stands. Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm so over the whole thing and some of it was quite a while ago so details are fuzzy.


tl;dr: husband is a rat who is trying to revoke his rat license after being caught. I love him dearly but I don't trust him anymore. Not sure what to do."
"I [23f] won $10,000 cash. My boyfriend [24m] of four years and I have been having a childish fight and I did something I can't undo.


He's a full-time student who works part-time in the summer. I have a full-time and part-time job (he studies a lot). We live together and mostly live off my pay while he stretches what he makes in the summer. Neither of us have ever owned a car because it isn't necessary where we live. 


We both walk or take the public everywhere to save money. In the morning we stop at a corner shop shortly before splitting up for the day. He buys cigarettes and coffee. I buy fruit for my lunch and, on the weekends, lotto tickets. 


He always makes fun of me for paying the ""stupid tax"". But I figure my indulgence is cheaper and doesn't come with lung cancer. Sometimes I jokingly tell him not to expect a penny when I win.


The day I won he answered me with ""Fine, keep it all! It's not like I'm crying over a penny of nothing over here.""


I showed him I'd won. He stared for a bit and then dismissively told me I'd probably spent more than that on tickets. In response I asked what I should blow his half on for myself. I was honestly joking at the time but he suddenly became angrier than I've ever seen him and I didn't want to admit I'd been kidding because he was so pissed off it pissed *me* off. 


He wants a car, and I don't. He keeps trying to steamroller me so I'm refusing to share the money. In honesty I'm willing to spend or save the money for us but I don't want a car. I won't use a car and it will keep costing us money in parking and maintenance. 


After weeks of him sulking and lecturing me about his ""entitlement"" to the money he took me to a car lot and tried to embarrass me into going along with him in front of a salesman. I threw a tantrum after we left without buying anything and I went to my mom's and paid our rent up to the end of the year and donated the rest to charity. He doesn't know. 


I fucked up and don't know how to come clean.


Tl;dr: I haven't told my boyfriend I spent the money I won because I was upset he was being a dick. He's already angry at me. What do I do? "

"I'm [27F] having troubles answering people's questions about my pregnancy, caused some drama with friends (all 20s)


I'm 7 months pregnant with a child I plan on giving to a wonderful couple, closed adoption. I made this choice because the child was the product of non-consensual sex. I didn't press charges because I was a bit of a party-girl and didn't think I would be believed. I honestly have no idea who the guy was, I just remember trying to push him off and being to drunk to do so. 

MY choice to not press charges. MY choice to keep the pregnancy. MY choice to adopt out. I am comfortable with these choices. They are private and personal and I am keeping most of this to myself. 

My asshole friends and co-workers have turned it into a game. I was hiding the pregnancy until I started really showing a couple weeks ago. I get that people are curious about it. It's rather surprising. But I saw a betting pool being passed around the office...THEY ARE PLACING BETS ON WHO IS THE FATHER! I was shocked and a little hurt. 

My friends are also curious. I have one close friend who basically knows everything (she's going to be in the room for the birth for me) and she's not telling anyone. So, rumors are starting. One terrible rumor is that it's my (now former) friend Karen's husband Troy's baby. Karen called me in tears. I went over to her house to tell her to her face it wasn't it possible. She demanded to know the truth. I told her it was none of her business and she blasted me on fb. 

Some friends have been really nice to my face but everything gets back to me eventually. Some people are saying that I'm a paid surrogate. I guess that one is ok. I hate that people are talking about me like this. I made ONE blanket statement on fb yesterday: ""I guess I can't hide it anymore. Yes, I am pregnant. I am giving a lovely couple the child they have tried to have for years. It's very personal and private and I ask that you all respect that."" It's got a bunch of comments but I haven't read them. I'm going to take a big break from social media. 

I don't know what else to do or say. I am uncomfortable with everyone's constant questions. I LOVE my job and usually my co-workers. It's my hope that I can suck it up and go back to normal in a few months. Weirdly, I've got great inner-peace with everything because I am so happy to be giving the adopting parents (who are the kindest men I have ever met: a kindergarten teacher and a social worker) something they could never have on their own. 

Here's what I need from the readers of this sub: What can I say that isn't a lie but will shut people up without giving out information I'm not comfortable sharing? I don't like calling her (the baby is female) an 'accident'. The two people who know the whole truth (my friend and my doctor) immediately asked me why I didn't report it. I'm ashamed and humiliated. I really don't want to say much of anything. I think a big part of why this is so hard for me and those around me is that I'm usually really talkative and social. Loud-mouthed. I'm in sales so now that I'm showing I'm also dealing with these questions from strangers too. Should I go to my manager about the pool? Laugh it off? Wait for it all to blow over?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I need to figure out what to tell people about my unplanned pregnancy in a polite but firm way that will make them stop speculating. 

**UPDATE**

Thank you so much for all the support. I'm glad I posted this. 

 I had a good cry, took an antacid (or 4) and went to the owner, Jim. I told him the truth and I told him that I really didn't want the guys to know and I needed the jokes and talk to stop because it was hurting me. He hugged me and told me he was proud of me (which made me cry again. Fucking hormones). He gathered the staff and had a quick (what he calls come to Jesus) meeting. He announced that he would fire anyone who made me uncomfortable about my pregnancy on the spot and that all the money from the pool needed to end up on my desk, pronto. He was great. He didn't share any of my personal info, he just protected me and made it quick and easy. After we disbursed, he told me I could have an additional week paid medical (I already have 2 weeks sick/vacation I haven't used). 

I am going to text/talk to my friend and tell her she can subtly let people know what happened (especially Karen). 

This baby bump is sales gold, I just landed a BIG commission *while sitting!* 

I still think, as great as Jim is, I need to get out of this town. I'll always be a trailer park slut to people around here. My mama died when I was real young and I acted out a lot after that. Everyone knows what I did and won't let me forget. Despite working my ass off to graduate, working my way up to sales lead, buying my home and fixing it up myself. I'm sick of Oklahoma. I'm thinking maybe somewhere in Oregon or Washington. Real pretty up there. 

Again, thank you for all the kind and helpful advice. I feel so much better. This has always been one of my favorite subs to lurk. Thanks. "

"I've(20M) been shunned by family for standing up for my little sister(14F)


My family has a very sad history. My parents met in high school, grew up close and were very successful in their careers. They had their first child when they were 22, their second at 25, and me at 29. When I was 5, my mother and father divorced. 

My father was broken from this, and our happy family went down the drain. I've never been close to my older brother and sister, and my father pushed me away. When I was about 7, my father met another woman, who I became close friends with. She was very kind to me, and had a healing effect on my father. She gave birth to a child, but subsequently died in childbirth. I was left to effectively raise my new sister, as my father didn't really do anything to care for her. 

It worked out OK, I guess. My birth mother and father got back together. My other two siblings were never nice to her, and my father didn't really care for any of us.  I at the end did my best to look out for her, and we're really close as a result. 

I moved out with my high school girlfriend into an apartment together near University, but I always kept up with my lil sis. However, last time I took her out to a movie with my girlfriend, I noticed she was pretty down. With enough prodding, I realized that my birth mother had been bullying her. Months of constant verbal and emotional abuse had been going on. 

I confronted my mother about it, and she brought my brother and sister into it as well. Cue a huge shouting match, them calling me akin to a blood traitor and me calling them the miserable sods that they are. I've practically been pushed away and told never to come back. 

Meanwhile, my little sister is still over there, suffering. My dad's no help, and it's affecting her health and grades. What can a guy do?

"My [25] wife [24] is obsessed with trying to get our toddler daughter [22m] ""discovered"" on instagram to be a model.


I love my wife but she refuses to go back to work and all she does is spend all the money left over from the job I hate but work to support them on new outfits every day for our kid because she wants to make her a 'brand rep' on Instagram so she can eventually get discovered as a model and 'make money' and 'be famous' and 'get free stuff'. She won't even work on the 3 days a week our kid goes to child care for socialisation. She uses it as time to nap and get her nails done.

My sister called her out on it and said that she is teaching our daughter that her only value is in her looks and what she is wearing/if she has the 'latest' clothes and that it's a really poor message to send to our child. My wife lashed out at my sister for that and is now trying to freeze her out. But I think my sister had a point.

I told my wife that I think she needs to stop doing this and now she is giving me the guilt trip for not 'supporting her' as a SAHM and not loving my daughter enough because 'don't you want her to have nice things'. Of course I do, but no child needs $250 a week spent on its wardrobe. 

Don't know what to do. I feel like if I push it too far, it will end badly, but I think this needs to stop.

So, my big sister and I have always got along remarkably well. Aside from the dumb squabbles as kids, we have never had a real argument in the whole twenty six years I've known her...until now. 


My sis and her husband recently announced they're expecting! It was great, they invited the whole family over for dinner and told everyone. She's *just* starting to show, which explains why she's been wearing baggy sweaters in 80 degree heat lol. Anyway, this was a couple weeks ago and everything's been fine. I even went with her to look at gender neutral items and stuff and it was delightful...and then about a week ago she sat me down over lunch on my day off from work and very brazenly said, ""you need to get pregnant so our kids can grow up together."" ...wait, what?! 


At first I thought she was kidding, but from her stony face and body language I quickly became aware that she was as serious as could be. I asked what the hell she was talking about and she explained that if I wait too much longer to have a child, our kids won't be close enough in age to have a good relationship and they won't he able to grow up together and be best friends. 


I do have a boyfriend, but we've only been dating for seven months and in my personal opinion that's *way* too long to he thinking about marriage and children, but my sister doesn't think so. I said that I wasn't going to get pregnant just so our kids can have an aesthetically pleasing relationship and it developed into an argument, where I left angry. 


We just talked again for the first time two days ago. It was my aunts birthday party so a bunch of our family was there and my sis kept making passive aggressive comments about me and how I'm not supporting her and stuff. My mom came up to me and apparently agrees with my sister! She said ""you don't know how much longer I have left, I expect grandkids and they need to have each other if something happens to you or Sister."" My mom's in her 60s and healthy as far as I know, and both my sister and I are healthy. 


I don't get what their problem is. I don't know if my boyfriend is the one. It'll be years before I'm in a place where I'd be able to support a child. I usually talk to my sister every day and now we're avoiding each other and things are tense with my mother, who will surely bamboozle my dad into agreeing with her. It looks like if I don't have a baby to appease them my family will be divided. 


What do I do?

"My [15M] sister [17F] &amp; Her boyfriend [17M] keeps telling me I was making to much noise in my bedroom last night. I was at my Aunts place the whole night


I don't really know what's going on, to be honest with you. My sister has been giving me shit about making to much noise in my room last night. I was not home, I was at my Aunts house. My mother and my aunt are in Ohio visiting their mother. 

My sister and I have a good relationship, we do things together. Talks on a nightly basis, walk to school together. I told her on Saturday I am spending the night at our Aunts place to make sure everything was OK and I would see her at home. I did not go to school today because of my ankle. I had to go get more tests done on it (i had surgery) and that took a couple of hours. So I just went home and here I am. 

I woke up this morning and I had texts from my sister to shut up, you're making to much noise, open the door, fuck you open this door. 

I called her and she basically chewed my ass off and she was telling me how her and her boyfriend almost called the cops. She was telling me how dare I look myself in my room and not answer, she was worried. She told me to listen to her. 

I told her I have no idea what she is talking about and I was at our aunts place. She said ""The fuck you were, we heard you talking in your room to yourself"". 

I don't know if this is some sort of prank but what do I do? My sister said "" Shawn, just do something nice for me and I will forgive you. I'm not mad just do something to make up for your behaviour"" But I did not do shit, I was not home I don't know what she is talking about 

tl;dr: Sister claims to have heard me in my room. "

"Me [26F] with my ex [29M]. Broke up because, apparently, I'm not supposed to like ''boy stuff.''


I grew up surrounded by vdeo games and classic rock and comics. My dad is a huge fan, and although my mom doesn't like it that much, she still enjoys some games and some of the music we listen to.

So this started at a young age, back when I was 6. My entire life I've been like this and liked the stuff that I like now. I have never, ever preached that annoying and stupid sentence ''I'm not like other giiiiiiirrrrllllllsssss'' because I find that shit so silly and dumb. Material stuff has no gender. I can like whatever I want without it meaning something. Most of my friends are girls and we all enjoy video games and this is relevant because we never looked at this shit in a oh we're so cooooool way. Never.

So, I didn't like dating. I liked hooking up and having my fun, and then I met David. We started talking because we were both wearing the same Metal Gear Solid t-shirt. Exactly the same. I thought that was awesome and during our conversation, I could see hwas trying to test my knowledge on the game. MGS is my favorite franchise and I'm honestly obsessed, so his plan went down. The reason I let it pass was because I thought it was in good fun.

We started dating soon after and he began discovering little things about me, my favorite things. He began discovering how crazy I am about anything related to Batman, how I knew even useless shit about the comics, he began to see how much I actually enjoyed playing games and at first, it wasn't bad.

We'd play together and he'd lose and be like 'ah shit', and then he just flipped one day. He caught me playing Arkham Knight and saw that I'd managed to achieve 206% in the game (this can be achieved by completing normal mode, nightmare mode and then doing all the side missions and challenges). He got visbly upset for some reason and at the time I thought it had NOTHING to do with the game. He tried to poke fun at it and say I was cheating, but I didn't care and asked him what was wrong. He said nothing.

Then, a few days later, I was playing Phantom Pain. I finally achieved 100%. He got upset again. I was irked but I still refused to believe it was because of a damn game. I went to bed, fell asleep and woke up to find him playing his own file. Fine. Went back to sleep, the next day I find out my file had been completely erased.

I called him out on it and he said he didn't do anything and I said I knew he was lying. I'm not ashamed to say I cried a little because I spent MONTHS doing EVERYTHING in the game to achieve the 100%.

He said I was overreacting but I didn't let go and then he FLIPPED.
He started saying how I was NOT supposed to be better than him at BOY STuff *roll eyes*, how I should stick with other stuff. He said he had this fantasy that I'd be bad at playing and he'd help me and I was ruining it (WHAT), and then he got even MORE crazy and brought our sex life in it. He said he always found it weird how much I liked it and the number of times I initiated it, because the girls he dated were always a little more shy about sex. He said he didn't think my behavior was good GF behavior. He said that I needed to change or we would be over and he made sure I knew he was not kidding.

I was so mad that I kept quiet and went to bed. I didn't sleep and two hours later, he climbed in bed with me, mumbled an apology and slept. I waited until I was sure he was sleeping and took all of my belongings: clothes, xbox one, and a couple of lotions I brought to his place. I textd my parents and I spent the night at their house (couple of days later I found an apartment). 

I blocked my BF on FB and instagram. I also changed the URL of my blog so he wouldn't find it anymore. I forgot to delete and block his number on my phone and I was met with OVER 100 messages in which he shows me the kind of physco he is. He apologized and then insulted me, then aplogized and insulted me some more. I didn't respond and blocked his number.

The good thing is that he has no idea where I'm living or where my parents house is (we dated for four months and no, I didn't introduce him to my parents. I was waiting until we'd hit the 6 month, so I knew it was serious), BUT he has been showing up to my work and making a fuss. I confronted him once and told him to stop coming here, to quit being an insecure little boy. He kept yelling and I walked away.

He stopped for a week and now he came back. He's harassing everyone and says I need to give him 'closure'. Ugh. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with him? I was never in this situation and I don't really know what to do. 

While I recognize that he's an ass, it still stings a bit. When my dad and my friends saw my 206% they were happy, my dad said he'd surpass me and started his own file. 

Meanwhile, the guy I used to care for and call BF just flipped out and turned into a sexist little pig.

EDIT: You guys are really awesome. Thank you for all the advice and comments. I took them to heart, sent him a message today and told him:

*This is the last time you'll ever hear from me: stop trying to contact me, stop showing up at my work and stop harassing people. Our relationship is over. If you don't stop, I WILL call the police, and you know I'm not kidding.*

Then I blocked him again and that's it. I'm still a little upset though because it's someone I liked and trusted and he just turned into one giant sexist bully. But I'll get over it, again, thank you for all the comments. &lt;3

"My girlfriend [30] told me [26M] that we “need time apart” when I asked her to marry me. I reluctantly agreed and met someone else [28F] who I am now dating. Now girlfriend reappeared and want to get back together; what should I do?


***EDIT- Called Madeline. Told her to go take her ""I love you, let's get back together"" and shove it up her ass. Then I called Jean and told her we should be together. She invited me to her apartment tonight. Time to stop dying with Madeline and get busy bangin' with Jean. Thanks Reddit!

---

I had been dating “Madeline” for about a year and a half. We met at a restaurant where I was a server and she was a customer. She left her number on her dinner check and I called her. We were boyfriend-girlfriend after a few dates.


I thought our relationship was going great. We went everywhere together. I’m more of a shy, bookish person so my social circle is different from hers. My friends are more the museum and classical music crowd, whereas hers are more the “cool kids” type.  With her, I met lots of new and interesting people. 


During our relationship I finished my degree in English and got a job as a substitute teacher. I might have finished sooner but because I was supporting myself and paying for school I sometimes had to take whole semesters off. I thought about going to graduate school to get a teaching certification and become a full-time teacher, but decided not to. Madeline was and still is a PR person for a small company. We began saying “I love you” after about four months of dating. Madeline and I both had our own apartments; I had a studio and she had a one-bedroom. Hers was nicer, and in a nicer part of the city. We’d often spend weekends at each other’s place, but since hers was larger and nicer of course her apartment was the more common weekend destination.


About sixteen months into our relationship I decided that I wanted to marry Madeline. I went and bought the nicest ring I could afford. I found one I thought she would like at a small jewelry store and paid close to a thousand dollars for it, after tax.


I asked Madeline to marry me and although she didn’t say “no” in so many words, she didn’t say yes, either. She only said that I was sweet, and reminded me that she loved me, but that she needed more time to find herself.


Well naturally I was crushed but I remained stoic and told her I understood. In the coming weeks, however, I noticed a marked decrease in her affectionate behavior. Whereas before she used to be really “hands-on” and touchy-feely, she gradually stopped doing that. We also gradually stopped spending every weekend together. She also stopped “tagging” me and uploading so many pictures of us on Facebook. It all happened gradually.


All of this “gradually” stuff took place over the course of maybe six weeks.


Eventually, after our relationship seemed to be tapering off, Madeline told me she wanted to “take a break from us.” She explained that she still loved me but that she needed time away from me. I didn’t want that, but I told her I understood. She further explained that during this break, I shouldn’t try to text her anymore, or message her on social media. In fact, in a low-key way she had changed her settings on social media so that there was no information about her relationship status at all. Well, at least she didn’t block or unfriend me. If she “limited” me, I’m not sure.


“When will the break end?”


“I don’t know.”


So, Madeline took her “break” and I tried my best to move on with my life. I know it was an impulsive move considering it was possible we might get back together, but I returned Madeline’s ring to the shop from which I bought it. They were cool about giving me back my money. The owner was actually really sympathetic. Madeline didn’t even really look at the ring when I asked her to marry me, so at least the relatively low-cost of the ring isn’t the reason for her rejection of me.


I ended up getting a job at a private school tutoring German, which I speak fluently because my parents were born there and we spoke German at home. Since it’s a private school, it doesn’t matter that I don’t have a post-graduate teaching degree. It’s also cool because the school director will pay for me to take extra units at community college, and will pay when I transfer to a four-year school to get a second degree. With my new job I’m earning more than double what I used to as a substitute teacher and waiter, even with tips. I’ve been at the new job four months. I moved into a bigger, nicer place this past August. It still isn’t as nice an apartment as Madeline’s, but it’s a lot nicer than the one I used to have, anyway.


I also met “Jean,” a fellow teacher who tutors French at our school. Jean and I started seeing each other, and we’ve been dating lightly for a month. At first just as friends, but I can tell Jean wants more. I do, too, but I’ve been trying to be loyal to Madeline. I’ve kept my relationship—what there is of it, anyway—with Jean really low key, both because we work at the same place, and because technically I’m still with Madeline.


Now, Madeline is suddenly texting me again, telling me that she’s ready to be with me again.


But now, I’m not so sure. I still have feelings for her, but I’m also feeling hurt, rejected and betrayed.


And then there’s Jean, too.


Maybe it was stupid of me to mention it, but I mentioned to Madeline that I’ve started seeing someone else. But I added the completely true detail that I haven’t slept with this person.


Madeline says that she’s hurt I’m seeing someone else and that this is a form of cheating.


I don’t know. I think that after six months of silence after she told me not to talk to her unless it was on her terms, I was starting to move in a positive direction for myself.


She says that she’s ready to get engaged and that she loves me.


If this had happened maybe after only one month of a break, I’d probably jump at the chance, but now, half a year later, and with Jean in the picture, I’m not so sure.


Asking for advice on what to do.


Tl;dr: I asked girlfriend to marry me. She said no, and that we needed a break. I consented. Several months later I met someone new, and started dating them. Now girlfriend is back and says she wants to resume our relationship. I’m not sure what to do.

"[Update] I (23F) called child protective services on my mom (46F) because I believe she is emotionally and physically abusing my little brother (8M). It did not end well, and I've given up hope.


The original post was just asking if I did the right thing by calling the child services on my mom, but I have lost any hope of getting my brother out of the situation.

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4zm5f4/i_23f_called_child_protective_services_on_my_mom/

So basically, I live in Utah and I tried to call the caseworker, and that's not possible in Utah, you can only make a report over the phone. Next thing I hear, my brother has been interviewed and they close the entire case, determining that he is safe. Due to my experience, I am positive that my mom can scare him into lying. I just don't understand with all the assault charges, my statement, and my stepfather's. What the hell is wrong with Utah??

Also my stepfather was trying to file a protective order against my mom because she has hit him with her car and stalks him, etc, and she lied to a judge and said that he showed porn to my brother, and they just dropped the protective order. Now he is evicted from his house because of her stalking behavior or these allegations, or both.

I would hire a lawyer, but I'm barely able to save $100 per month. I can't afford it. Any advice would be lovely, but I just wanted to get some emotional support and say what the fuck, Utah!

**TLDR** The state of Utah ignored all of the evidence and dismissed the request to have my brother moved from an abusive home, based on one interview with my little brother. Then my mom accused my stepdad of showing porn to my little brother and had him evicted from his home and he can't file a protective order against her."

[Original here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4orb9a/me_32f_with_my_husband_32_m_2_years_left_today/)


Oh dear I hope I formatted and linked this properly.  

I just had a wonderful night and wanted to thank all of you and give a quick update.  When I left off I had just signed a lease on an apartment.  Well, I ended up not taking the apartment and moving back in (cringe).  I don't know what I was thinking.  I contacted him about getting my things and then one thing lead to another and I was back in the condo.

That lasted for a solid month before another terrible argument.  He would come sit near me on the couch and if I didn't respond to his liking, I would get a lecture about my behaviour.  I always felt like my behaviour was under a microscope.  It was exhausting.  So one weekend, he put on a movie and I was on my computer.  He said he wanted us to both be watching the movie together so I put my computer away which angered him.  We spent 2 days arguing about that.  He made fun of me and mocked my voice and I finally just snapped.  I'm not actually proud of this part.  I told him I hated him and that I regretted marrying him and ever meeting him.  He said all sorts of hateful and hurtful things back.

So I'm done.  I left the following day with whatever could fit into my car.  If it didn't fit in my car I didn't take it.  I'm living in a house with some other professionals and students.  It's not the best place I've ever lived but it is only until April and it is dirt cheap.  It is safe and clean so I can't ask for much more than that.  I blocked his phone number and email address.   I haven't talked to him since I moved out.

For two weeks after I was a mess.  The amount of rage I felt towards him was scary.  Not that I was going to kill him or hurt him.  But I was just so angry.  Then I was sad because I just wanted someone to love me and have fun in this life.  Is that too much to ask for?  I came back and re-read all the lovely things everyone wrote.  Thank you all for your kind words.

Tonight I finally felt like my old self.  I went to a concert and I had so much fun.  It was phenomenal.  I love that I don't have to walk on egg shells where I live.  I love that I'm not constantly feeling pressured to have sex (because according to him the Bible says I can't deny him).  I'm not a slave to his dick anymore.  I love that I am free to wear whatever I want at home (he seriously says that girls need to be careful with what they wear because they don't know how guys brains work).  I honestly didn't feel comfortable wearing yoga pants at home because he would get turned on and be chasing me with his boner as I had my shoes on and out the door to go to the gym.  I feel so free and light.  I've also started therapy.

I just really want to thank everyone for getting me on the right path again.

  **tl;dr**: Reddit told me to leave.  I (stupidly) went back then noped the fuck out of my marriage."
"Me [27M] father of twin kids [9M, 9F], now living with my sister [27F]. The family of my deceased wife is constantly bothering us and trying to interfere with my children, and now I also have a cancer diagnosis. I don't know what to do with this whole situation, I am feeling so lost.



I’m 27 years old.  My wife passed away less than a year ago suddenly in a car crash.  We’d been married for four years. 

The pregnancy happened all by accident when I was 18, she was a few years older.  It turned out to be twins (twins run in my family, I myself am a twin).  At the time I wanted to marry her, I even proposed, I thought it would be the right thing to do so that I could support the kids and they could grow up in a proper home.  I wanted to be a good father unlike my own father and fully involved in my kids life, I had always swore to myself that if I ever have kids I would never let myself be an absent father like my own dad was.

At the time when I proposed, my wife rejected.  She said she wasn’t in love with me at the time, but she still let me be fully involved in the life of the kids. I was there when they were born, I juggled going through university and being the dad of two kids at the same time.  I tried to be as supportive and involved in their life as I could, we split it between us.  Over years of parenting together, despite our differences, I guess she did eventually fall in love with me (I’d always been in love with her), and we got married.  I guess all the time together and the experience of growing and raising children together really made us feel like a family and we did fall in love, and we ended up getting married.

Our married life wasn’t always easy.  We were saving up and we ended up buying a house, a nice one too, which we hoped we’d raise our family in.  However things became sort of hard after that, my wife developed a drinking problem which I didn’t even know about, and while we did many things to help her, it never fully disappeared.  She ended up having to quit her job and I was working full time and over-hours to support our family. Luckily I had a somewhat well-paying job so we still made our ends meet. Our relationship with my in-laws was never good.  Her parents and family hated me, they hated the fact that she had kids with me, she hated the fact that she ended up marrying me.  They always thought she could do better than me, they thought she had massively “settled” when she ended up marrying me and resented the fact that she ended up married to me.  I’m not a vagrant or anything, I had an education, a good job. I have no idea why they never liked me.  Both me and my wife are white, so its not like it could be a racism issue, but I have no idea why they never warmed up to me.  They loved my wife, they loved their grandkids, but they never liked me.

Well tragedy struck less than a year ago.  My wife was killed in a car accident, it still feels like it was yesterday when I received the phonecall, it was the worst day of my life, the day my life turned upside down.  For my kids, it must have been even worse.  How do children even grasp the fact that their mum is gone and never coming back? How can they understand something as severe as death when it’s the first time they’ve experienced it and with someone so close? It was so horrible, my life turned upside down and I still haven’t recovered.

After the initial shock, I decided I need to stop moping about my own life, I have two children depending on me and I must do everything in my power I can to provide for them and ensure they have the best life possible given the circumstances.

First thing I did was move out of the house.  The current house we were living in was too big for just me and two kids.  I’m renting it out, which is good, as now I have some added income.  I also sold a large amount of the furniture we had.

I moved in with my sister, she lives on her own and was more than happy to take in myself and my kids, especially after all that we’ve been through, she’s been extremely helpful and sympathetic.  I insisted on paying her rent to make it fair, but she adamantly refused, insisting that “her home is our home”, saying she could never make us pay rent when she knows I have children to take care of and when she’s financially very well off herself as it is.  I’ve made up for it by paying for groceries, toiletries, any other necessities whenever I can.

Another major decision I’ve made is to enrol my kids in a different school.  They were in a public school in the past, and while it was the cheap option, I don’t feel they were getting the best education possible.  They didn’t always get along well with the other kids, it was kind of a rough crowd at the school, and I felt the teachers there weren’t exactly what you’d call enthusiastic.

I enrolled them in a private school with the added money I have from renting out our old house, and yes while it is more expensive, I think they are much better off.  They are getting a more focused and dedicated education, they are in a better environment without bullying, I feel the teachers are better.  I know this is as very difficult time for them and I feel if they focus on school, they might be able to have an outlet and take their minds away from the horrible circumstances our family is in.

My sister, as I mentioned, has been entirely supportive of all my decisions.  She’s helped in driving them to and from school when I can’t, done the occasional baby-sitting when I have to work overtime, and she’s juggled it around her full-time work schedule.  She really loves them so so much, and they love her too.  If you saw how much she loved them, you’d think they were her own kids, and she knows that after all they’ve been through, that they need all the love and support they can get.  She says my son in particular looks exactly like me when I was a kid, and reminds her of me when we were kids, and in fact both my kids remind her of us two when we were kids, which makes sense since they’re twins and we’re twins.  But the point is, she has been incredibly incredibly unconditionally supportive.

Now there’s the issue of the in-laws.  As I said, they never really liked me.  After my wife’s tragic death, for a period we did become very close, sharing in our grief with each other.  It was almost like I was a part of their family for that period, and they were very loving and caring and supportive of my kids during that time.

However, after that, they started opposing many decisions I was making.  For example they were really angry when I started renting out the house, when I moved to another suburb, and when I moved my kids to a different school.  They were angry that I was making all these decisions on my own, they felt they too should have a say.  I told them I would always appreciate their advice but they are my children, I’m the sole legal guardian, they are my responsibility, I make the decisions. They are welcome to offer advice, but I make the decisions.

They didn’t like that.  Things got worse after that, they were trying to interfere and involve themselves, while maintaining the same cruel demeanour they had held towards me in the past.  When I asked help from them for things like watching over the kids or babysitting, they were always busy, but they just wanted to see the kids when they had free time without any responsibility and still have an equal say over decision making, which I would not accept.

Eventually relations got pretty bad and I started cutting them out more and more, not contacting them at much.  They would sometimes drop by unannounced at my sister’s house, which my sister really hated. They were always really rude and disrespectful to my sister whenever they came. Eventually my sister told them they can’t come whenever they want and she wouldn’t just open the door to them, and it ended up in a huge fight between me and them which permanently severed relations.

I still see them from time to time.  Like when I’m shopping, I occasionally see my wife’s parents, or her sister and her sister’s family.  Or for example at inter-school events, I’d see my wife’s sister, since she and her husband have kids around the same age as our kids that go to a different school.

We also see them at Church a lot.  I haven’t been to Church in a long while, I’m kind of having a crisis of faith, that’s another story though, but when I do go, they see me there and they are very judgemental towards me.  Like “oh, he hasn’t been to Church lately”.  My sister however still goes to Church every week and still takes the kids with her, she says she sees my wife’s family there but avoids them.
My sister has also frequently run into my wife’s parents or my wife’s sister when she does the shopping.  She says they are very mean to her, ask provocative questions trying to make her out to be a bad housetaker and like she’s not fit to be taking care of the kids, and they are very mean to her in general.  She says my wife’s sister in particularly has a very nasty streak towards her.

One day my sister came back home crying, I had no idea what had happened, but apparently she had run into them, and they’d had a conversation which turned into an argument and they said some very hurtful things to her and she had started crying as soon as she got back to the car.  She said at the time she felt so tiny and squashed by them but she had been determined not to cry in front of them.  I had really had enough of them at this point that they were going this far to make our lives hard, the family of their own grandchildren.

As if I don’t have enough problems in my life, very recently in the past few weeks I’ve had some really bad news.  I’ve been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and am going to need to have radiation and chemotherapy soon.  I might die, and my children might be left orphans, that terrifies me.  So far nobody else knows about my diagnosis except my sister, I haven’t told my kids, my mother, or any friends or other relatives.  

My sister has taken it really horribly, she’s been crying every night, spontaneously crying.  She hasn’t been able to eat, during dinner and meals sometimes she just spontaneously starts crying.  My kids know something is wrong and they know I’m hiding something from them, I just don’t know how to tell them.  My sister keeps saying “I don’t want you to die, I don’t want you to die”. I told her whatever happens, happens, but we’ll try our best to prevent it.  She’s an adult but she seems to be struggling to accept the concept that I might die, I don’t even know how I can break the news to my kids that their dad is sick and his life is in danger.  I’m also really worried about my sister, this is all so much for her, I really feel so sorry for her. When I see her cry, my kids cry, and I want to cry to.  I can’t stand knowing how my own disease is destroying her on the inside.  I hear her sobbing in the middle of the night and praying for me, begging and pleading with God for me not to die.  Every time I try to talk to her about it and discuss with her the issue, the tears start coming, its made our life really hard the past week.  Every time I try to discuss it with her, the tears start flowing like a tap, she starts whimpering “I don’t want you to die, I don’t want you to die” and its like she regresses into a child-like state, I can’t imagine what she’s going through.
  
So yeah, things are really difficult for me at the moment.  The purpose of this post is to ask for advice on the best way to handle the situation with my wife’s family.  How can I get them off my back and stop them bothering us and making life for us so difficult by constantly interfering with how I parent my children?  And secondly, the whole issue with me and my illness, what can I do for my sister, she’s suffering immensely from an emotional point of view, and when is the best time to explain it properly to my children?

**TLDR: Wife deceased, now living with my two kids at my sister’s house.  Wife’s family are constantly interfering in my life and with how I raise my children, making life very difficult. I also have a recent diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, its sent my sister into an emotional crisis, she’s crying all the time, and I don’t know how to explain it to my kids.  What should I do?**

"UPDATE - A Nurse [??M] at the local hospital is making me [24F] feel bad when I go in for appointments.


Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51mfus/a_nurse_m_at_the_local_hospital_is_making_me_24f/)

Last Wednesday I sent my email off to the patient relations department of the hospital. Today the clinical manager for the Fracture Clinic called me personally.

The nurse in question is not actually a nurse - he is a orthopedic technologist. The manager explained to me that this means he sets casts and fits braces - and air boots. Apparently he did think I should have been wearing a smaller boot and the boot I was wearing was too much for just a broken toe. (However, seeing as how he was not the doctor who treated me initially and SPECIFICALLY assigned that size of boot...) He also *supposedly* was trying to make a joke with his comments. The manager told me she had spoken to him and told him that his comments were not perceived as sarcasm/a joke and apparently he felt bad for offending me.

I feel like the Clinic Manager did take my concerns seriously, but also now this guy totally knows I ratted on him and now I have to see him in three weeks. Still anxious about that but at least it's for different reasons now!

Ok so I've been talking to this guy on Tinder very briefly and he said how he was a chef and how he makes all these fancy dinners and stuff.

He asked what my favorite meal was and I said mac &amp; cheese. So he suggested getting together tomorrow night so he could make this special, fancy mac &amp; cheese for me.

I thought it sounded so cute and was imagining him like making it in this fancy kitchen, us eating at this fancy table in his fancy apartment, maybe watching a movie afterward, something like that.

So tonight he said he made the meal already and we'll just have to heat it up tomorrow. Ok, a little bump in the plan but alright still sounds cool.

And then I said 'Oh I forgot to ask, what part of town are you living in?' so I'll know what city i'll have to drive to tomorrow. But he said he's actually like 4 hours away at the moment and he comes into the city on the weekends and usually stays at a friend's place.

So I asked 'wait where will we be eating this meal then?' and he asked if we could eat it at my place!

Cue the record scratch and I was like 'wait what?' I practically live in a frat house with 3 male roommates and I guess I wasn't expecting to be the host. Like where are we gonna eat? All we have is a kitchen island and that'd be weird sitting side-by-side on a 'first date'. And my roommates are gonna be home and they're gonna be like jokingly picking on me that I have this formal date going on with all of them around. And what are we gonna do after? I don't have a TV so we can't watch movies or anything. I guess we could go somewhere afterward and like get a drink. But ugh this just wasn't what I expected lol.

So what do I do? I kind of just want to say 'forget it' but he already made the meal! And nobody's ever done something like that for me, especially not someone who I've barely spoken to!

Chris has always been the perfect older brother to live up to and I think he feels like Matty resented him for it. Their relationship only became really close, maybe codependent, when Chris came out as gay and our parents stopped talking to him for a couple years. 


They asked him for a reference letter a few months ago because they are ready to adopt. Matty agreed and acted really happy to be an uncle when I was around him. 


A couple nights ago at my sister Tamara's house Matty was drinking and made some really off color jokes about Chris adopting. I asked him what his deal was and he started rambling about Chris and Nils forgetting about him. He seemed really upset that Nils wouldn't have time to train with him or attend as many of Matty's meets and competitions if he had a kid. I remember him saying ""I'm kaput once they have their shiny new Benetton kid to play happy daddies with.""


He said it wasn't fair that he wasn't young or cute enough for them. I told him it was pretty weird he felt threatened because it meant ""child"" is the role he occupies space in in Chris and Nil's life. He was crying and mumbling at this point. While I was comforting him he begged me not to tell them about the letter. When I asked him what he meant he repeated ""I didn't send a good letter."" multiple times until Nils came to take him home. 


In the context I'm a 1,000% sure he meant the recommendation letter. He'd mentioned it weirdly and then abruptly changed subjects shortly before his meltdown. 


I told my sister what happened and she thinks that they deserve to know so they don't ask him for help again in the future. She also thinks they should ask Matty to move out so he doesn't go ""psycho"" if they do adopt. 


Tl;dr: I don't want to be responsible for Matty ending up on the street. I don't want to ruin everyone's relationships either. Is it really my place to tell Chris and Nils what Matty said?

"Me [21M] with my ex gf [19 F] She has super conservative parents, we broke up a a long time ago but her parents just found out we had sex and her dad just messaged me. What should i do???


Hello good people of reddit, i frequent this sub a lot and i know its filled with lots of good people that gives pretty good advice. Throwaway because friends know my reddit account. Sorry in advance if it sounds rushed or anything, im kind of rushed and just wrote what i could, ill answer any questions that anyone may have.

Okaaaay, so im going to try to keep to the main essentials, I met Megan last summer and we began dating. We were both virgins at the time. I had messed around with other girls before but never had actually gone all the way before, she basically saw it as i had already lost my virginity tho. She has really conservative parents as do i, who believe that you should hold off until marriage to have sex etc. Well long story short, after dating for a while we began having sex, we always had protection and were careful.. I just want to stress the fact that she was 18 at the time we started dating and she turned 19 while we dated altho because she was held back a year she was still a senior in highschool while i was already in college. 

While we dated her dad once asked me if i had ever had sex before and i lied and told him no, she had told me to lie for us so i did and he knew where my parents worked and i guess call me paranoid but they have a history of doing rash decisions so i didnt want there to be a chance where they would try to reach out to my parents and tell them what i had done. 

We broke up in February because the relationship wasnt working, we were fighting a lot and we decided to split ways. It wasnst exactly amicable but we have talked a handful of times since and have been civil. Ive tried to push that whole relationship out of my life since and move on. 

Sooo on to the problem at hand, she texts me today out the blue telling me if anyone from her family contacts me, to NOT tell them anything or answer anything. I asked her why and she told me she told her sister she wasnt a virgin anymore and that she had sex with me and one other guy after we broke up. Her sister told her parents so she wanted to warn me before they reached out to me. I didnt really think anyone would bother contacting me so i shrugged it off and told her whatever and left it at that. Now her dad just sent me a message on FB telling me he needs to speak with me when i have a chance. I havent opened up the message as to not show the read part but i saw the little notification on my phone. 

Yes i do realize that Im 21 and if he tells my parents it shouldnt matter because im on my own and they dont really have a say in my life anymore which they dont, but they believe about waiting till marriage for sex for religious reasons and if they find out i had sex, it will really hurt them and most def make a rift in our relationship. Ive already had a rocky relationship with them and i dont want to make it worse.
  
My question is, What should i do? Should i ignore the dad? What if he contacts my parents and tells them? Should i tell him anything? I dont want to argue weather i should care if my parents find out or about religious morals, just about the situation with my exes parents. I really appreciate any advice and support you guys can offer.

  TLDR: Dated girl with strict religious parents, I have strict religious parents, I had sex with this girl, we broke up, I moved away to another state for college, she contacts me and tells me her parents found out about her having sex, and now her parents want to talk to me after months of no contact.

Update: So i have been reading all of your comments and i appreciate it everything everyone has been saying. 

I decided not to answer him and just wait it out. She texted me again telling me she was sorry but she came clean to her dad and she hopes everything works out and he doesnt take measures.... (I dont know what that means, frankly i dont really care, i agree that this is between him and her and weve been broken up for a while theres no reason why he should be looking to me for an explanation.) 

She texted me and told me not to ignore her dad because he has my parents phone number and will call them if he has to. I talked to my roommate and a few of my friends that live near my apartment and they advised me to message him back but feel out the conversation, not admit to anything and not justify anything, it is what it is and it happened, i honestly dont see what he gets out of talking to me or lecturing me or whatever he wants to do. I do hope he doesnt call my parents bc that would be a real dick thing of him to do for literally no reason at all. ugh this whole thing is such a headache that i thought was supposed to be over with. I appreciate all the input and i will update once i can/have something to update with.

Edit: Format


Update 2: WOW this has really blown up way bigger than i thought it would. Ive been reading through all of the comments and i appreciate all the advice from you guys. Soooo on to the update

I woke up this morning and my dad called me, i feared the worst but he only needed like basic tech support for his computer, and that was all he wanted. I felt relieved and went through my day. A little while ago my sister calls me and asks me what my exes dads name is, i tell her and she tells me that he called dad and left a voicemail saying he was going to try and call again today. Most of my family was there and i was on speaker phone so they asked if knew anything and i told them i wouldnt know why my exes family would try to contact them after us being broken up for such a long time. My dad said it was odd and he would wait for the call and see what was up, he figures her dad just wants advice on something so he would let me know what it its about.

I called my sister shortly after and told her why he was calling, and her response was literally bursting out in laughter. She thinks its really weird for him to do this because he gains nothing from calling us, my ex is obviously not pregnant and we both dont think he would try to pull the consent card, so we figured he just wants to ""tell on me"" basically and that would be that. My sister and my dad are hanging out all day today and she told me not to worry about it and it will be okay, she will be texting me and let me know or give me a heads up if anything happens. As soon as i get a response i will let you guys know! "
"I (28M) am a groomsman in my friends (28M) wedding. He wants a 7+ day bachelor party. My fiancé is pissed. Thoughts?


Hey reddit, just need advice. My fiancée and I are getting married in a few months, so we've been busy saving money and planning the wedding. My friend just got engaged to his girlfriend of 3 months and they are having their wedding before ours. He's a groomsman in my wedding. He asked me to be a groomsman in his and I said yes. All was well. Then he dropped the bomb on me that he wants a 7-day bachelor party!! I told him I'd think about it, but my fiancé is adamantly against the idea. He and the other groomsmen will be doing surfing/extreme sports and he wants me (the owner of a big SUV) to drive them around to different beaches across the country.

My fiancée thinks he's just using me and asked me to be a groomsman so that he could use me for my vehicle. She also thinks a week long bachelor party is insane and irresponsible to attend, especially since we are so close to our own wedding. She told me to decline his offer and tell him I can't be in the wedding. Is a week long bachelor party too much? Does my fiancée have a point? 

Tldr: asked to be a groomsman in my friends wedding. He is going on a week long bachelor party and wants me to drive him and the other groomsmen around.

Edit before people start criticizing: my fiancée does not like this guy, he has screwed me over before but I always give him chances since we go way back . She thinks this should be my wakeup call to see what kind of guy he really is. "
"I 27F own a small but very profitable business, husband 29M doesn't understand why I don't want to hire his sister and our neighbor. Saying it is my duty (???) to hire them.


I'm going to keep this short.

I own a small business that actually does very well. I've but a lot of years, money, and time into the company and it has grown 30% every year for the past 3 years. And I am doing so great. I really do love it and have a lot of pride and passion for it.

Anyways, sister in law needs a job, as well as one of our neighbors. Purely based on their resumes and not from a family/friend stand point, I wouldn't hire them. As well as their work ethic and some other factors I just wouldn't even be interested in hiring them if they had sent in their resumes as strangers.

My husband however, thinks I owe it to them to hire them. My husband works for his brother, but my husband actually went to school for his trade and does a good job. His brother didn't hire him because he was his brother. 

I've tried to explain to my husband that I don't feel comfortable hiring them, and from a business standing I really do not feel confident in how they would perform as employees for me. I do have the availability to bring on 2 new employees but I don't feel comfortable hiring them. 

How do I get this point across to my husband without sounding uptight at rude?

"A Nurse [??M] at the local hospital is making me [24F] bad when I go in for appointments.


**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your advice. I was hesitant to contact the hospital because I was a little worried that I was being overly sensitive. I wrote an email and sent it into the patient relation's department (I basically copied what I've written below). My next appointment isn't for another four weeks but I will update when I can.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Nearly three weeks ago, I broke my big toe at the gym. I had to drive/walk myself to the urgent care clinic and every step was agony. They took an xray and yep, totally broke clean through the top joint in two places. 

Because it's a toe (even though it was my big toe) they can't really set it - it needs to heal on its own. The fun part about big toes is you really need them for balance, and they're connected to a number of tendons in the foot- meaning even when I'd step only on my heel or outside of my foot, there was still pain as the tendons shifted. They recommended to me that I either get my foot/leg plaster casted or purchase an air cast to keep the foot/toe immobile to let it heal. I bought an air cast, and the emergency clinic booked an appointment with the specialist at the fracture clinic in the hospital for later that week.

Walking was still really painful for the first week. I tried to stay off it as much as possible, but I do need to walk around for my job so I couldn't completely avoid it (nor did I want to).

When I showed up at the fracture clinic, a nurse took me into see the doctor and looked me up and down and in a derisive tone of voice said ""You're wearing that boot for JUST a broken toe??"". I'm was confused so I just said ""Yes?"" and he walked away. I met with the doctor and he told me to stay off the foot, use the boot, and keep taping my toes. 

Today (2 weeks after the initial appointment) I went back for a follow-up. Same nurse. Same thing. This time I responded with ""Well, it was my big toe."" But he kinda did this snort thing and walked away.

Anyways, the more I think about it the more I'm bothered by it. The doctors at both the emergency clinic and the fracture clinic told me to use the boot. What if the nurse had made comments like that to someone else who felt guilty and decided to forgo the boot/sling/whatever and ended up injuring themselves worse?

I know it's just a toe and there are other people at the clinic with broken shoulders/arms/legs and I don't think my pain can be worse then theirs - but if walking in the boot is what makes my pain manageable, why is a nurse making me feel bad for doing so?

Anyways - I have ANOTHER appointment in a few weeks and it's already making me feel anxious to have to deal with this nurse again. 

Are his comments okay and I'm just over-reacting? Should I say something TO him? What should I say to him? Should I say something to the hospital?

"I (21F) told my boyfriend (25 M) about a fetish I was interested in exploring. He acted interested at first, and then basically ended up mocking me for it in front of other people.


My boyfriend Jack and I have been dating for a little over a year. At the start of our relationship, I was very sexually inexperienced. We've become very adventurous over the past year and have tried a lot of different things, and I have always felt that I can talk to him about anything I'm interested in trying, no matter how ""weird"" it might be. I don't expect him to always be interested in the same things I am, but I know that I can at least bring it up without him judging me.

A few weeks ago, we were talking about threesomes, and he asked me if I would ever be interested in one. I admitted that while I had no interest in a threesome, I did have a fantasy about watching another man blow him. He thought about for a second and said it sounded fun and he'd be willing to try it. I hadn't expected him to be interested in it, so I was very surprised but pleased.

We started talking about men that we might want to ask to be a part of this, and Jack suggested his best friend, Alan. Alan and Jack have been involved in threesomes with each other in the past, and Jack said he thought Alan would be interested in this. We agreed to ask him, and if he wasn't interested, no big deal, we'd just move on.

So last night, we were at a party with Alan. We had all been drinking, Jack especially, and it was obviously a terrible environment to bring up the situation with Alan, which I thought would've been common sense. However, Jack turned to Alan and said ""Wanna know what whatsthatinmyfridge's biggest fantasy is? She wants to watch you suck my cock!"" I think that Alan thought Jack was joking, and they both immediately started laughing. I was pretty embarrassed and wanted them to drop it, but they both kept teasing me about it. 

When I asked them to stop, Alan apologized and immediately stopped, telling me he'd thought it was a joke. Jack, however, brushed me off and kept lightly teasing me for the rest of the night.

When we got home, I confronted Jack, asking him what the hell he was thinking and why he thought it was ok to do that. He looked genuinely surprised and apologized, saying it was all in good fun and he meant no harm. I told him that I didn't understand why he was making fun of me for something he was interested in too, and he scoffed and said ""Gross, I would never be interested in that. I'm not going to ask Alan to blow me! That's so weird!""

I am very hurt and offended by his behavior. I think it was very disrespectful and immature. If he wasn't interested, all he had to do was say so, it wasn't like I pressured him. Am I overreacting or is this kind of behavior as bad as I think it is? 

Tldr: told my boyfriend I wanted to watch another guy blow him, boyfriend said he was into it, then made fun of me for it in public and denied ever being interested"

"My [33f] husband [29m] masturbated while touching another woman's breasts and then admitted that my small breasts ""disgust"" him. Now he wants me back. Really lost, please help.


Sorry it got so long. Nothing new here I suppose. Yet another cheating spouse. I'm just feeling so lost, disgusted, *disgusting*, and I need advice or just anything right now. Warning: I do go into some explicit detail, sorry. It's all relevant.

My husband and I have been together for 6 years and married for 4, separated for a little over a month because of what happened. We have one beautiful baby boy together, approx 1 years old.

My husband is not without fault, though neither am I. We have had to attend couples counseling in the past because my husband, ""Nate"", was *extremely* controlling. He used to be absolutely obsessed that I was cheating on him. I don't believe that a partner should have any say in what you wear or if you ""can"" or ""cannot"" go out with trusted friends, so I never backed down when he tried to restrict what I wore or how often I would go out for drinks with friends (not very often, by the way). This would result in huge blowout fights in which he would insult me pretty intensely, though never about my body until this fight.

So we have worked out most of those issues and it's been pretty much smooth sailing for the past 3 years or so. However, several weeks ago we got into a huge fight. I decided to meet up with two girlfriends and a guy friend (who I have been friends with since I was 20 years old and my husband knows well) to have a couple drinks and blow off some steam. Nothing wild, just a couple of glasses of wine and some laughs. I had texted my husband a few days prior letting him know that I would be going out with friends so I'd needed him to not make any plans so he could watch our son. He agreed, no problem.

The day comes around and after work I get home and start getting ready. It had been some time since I really put in a great deal of effort into dressing up. Mothers and fathers out there, and just anyone with a busy schedule, I'm sure you can relate to having those days where you just feel like taking the time to look good. I'm used to having my hair up in a bun for ease, wearing little to no makeup, and having some sort of baby-related stain on my work clothes. 

That night, I really put in the effort. I wore a nice dress, makeup, hair done. My husband lost his shit. He yelled at me that my dress was so short you could practically see my vagina (not true), that I was trying to dress like an 18 year old (not true), and that a clearly wanted to f**k my guy friend (not true). Then he insulted my body. He said that I looked ridiculous because my breasts are so small (they are quite small- just means I don't usually have to wear a bra- yay!) and that I look disproportionate because of them. Apparently I look disproportionate to him because I'm tall (5'11"") with an hourglass figure... up until my chest at least. He said I looked pathetic and that my breasts have ""always disgusted him"", that the only male who would ever want to touch breasts like mine is our son when he's breastfeeding.

I was obviously really hurt and I admit my reaction was not the best. I basically just told him to f**k off, he was the disgusting one, and only call me if there was an issue with our son. I said I would be back around 11:30 and I left.

I had a good time with my friends. I tried to forget about the fight but of course it was like a black cloud over my night. When I got home (on time) my husband's car wasn't parked outside. My husband and son were not inside. I panicked because of our fight and started calling him and texting him. Maybe about a half an hour later he got home with our son. He wouldn't answer me when I asked where he had been and once I put our son to bed I demanded to know why he had felt it was appropriate to take our son somewhere at that time of night without telling me. After a lot of pressure he started to cry and he told me he couldn't tell me where he'd been because I'd leave him.

Anyway, turns out that he went **with our son** to a woman's apartment that he works with. They are friends, I've met her, never thought anything about her. She does have extremely large breasts- like very, very large. He admitted that he went over there because she had asked him earlier this week if he could stop by to hang out and he was bored since I was gone so he texted her and accepted the offer. Basically, he f-ed her breasts and then masturbated while groping them until he finished on them. He said he didn't do anything else except ""a lot of groping and some sucking on them"". He then let out this string of emotions about how large breasts are his ""thing"" and mine have always disappointed him but he loved me so he never said anything. He said he'd been looking forward to getting me pregnant ""for years"" because he hoped they would become engorged and that he could get off on sucking them. But apparently they hadn't gotten large enough, it was ""really just the nipples that got large and engorged"" which was apparently ""really gross"" to him.

Fast forward over a month and here I am. I'm not in the sobbing-uncontrollably-for-hours stage anymore, more in a stage of limbo. I left him, I guess technically I asked him to leave. My son and I have been living in the house while he rented out a loft downtown. He begged for forgiveness, apologize excessively, and got himself into therapy. I hired a divorce lawyer and have been hammering out a divorce agreement so I can file soon. But after giving me a couple of weeks of no contact, Nate has been contacting me again, telling me how well therapy is going, and he seems genuinely appalled by his behavior. 

So. We have a son together, I *do* love him, and I want my family back. But... I really don't know how to forgive him. Even more hurtful than the evening he spent with that woman were the hateful and insulting things he said to me and about me. I don't know if the disgust I feel for him will ever go away. I've been seeing a therapist and it's helpful but I'm still lost. I'd really, really love to hear opinions or advice right now, Reddit.

**tl;dr** My husband has a repressed large breasts fetish that he hid from me. Nothing shameful in that, however, he masturbated on a woman's breasts and then told me that mine ""disgust"" him. I've already separated from him but now he wants me back. I do want my family together again but I don't know if I can. Lost and looking for advice or encouragement, anything.


**Edit:** I'm not afraid to be alone, but I am concerned about the effect a divorce could have on my child. I guess it's for this reason that I'm doubting my decision to file for divorce. My friends have all backed me up but my mother is putting immense pressure on me to stay. Of course, listening to her would be absurd for several reasons, one of which being that she let my father walk all over her until the day he passed away. Just wanted to clarify that my gut knows leaving is best, I guess I just wanted to hear the opinions/advice of strangers that are unbiased, I think it will be helpful in this incredibly confusing time.

**Edit again:** Just words, realized the way I put something made no sense."

Hi Reddit, so any and all advice would be appreciated. 

2 days ago my brother killed himself, I still don't know why. There was no note, no reason as to why he would have done it, but he hung himself in his apartment. I told my mother what happened and everyone is upset. 

My mom does not want to tell my little brother and sisters, she fears Owen is going to take it the hardest because him and Daniel were like the best of friends.

I am close to my siblings and we want to be close to each other in our life. Daniel and Owen were brothers and he would always ask Dan to help him with things. 

Owen is my little brother and he idolised Daniel, just followed him around and wanted to know everything. My mother does not want to tell my sisters what happened and is threatening to disown me if I say anything. She won't even tell our step dad what is going on. 

She just left and has been staying with me, it's been almost 2 days now. I think my sisters may know because of Facebook but I don't think my brother does

"My girlfriend [31] says that my part-time job as a barista is an embarrassment and that I [27M] should quit as soon as possible


I work as a professional editor translating books into other languages, usually from French to Russian, or Russian to Vietnamese, vice versa. I speak English too, but it is by far my weakest language.


My girlfriend of one year and two months works as a pilates and yoga instructor. She speaks English perfectly of course, but does not master any other language other than being able to somewhat understand Spanish if it is spoken very slowly.


I make easily enough money in my job but since I work on only two or three books every month, often I will finish very quickly and have nothing to do.


I am a nice person and I have friends, but nearly all work normal jobs from nine in the morning until the afternoon, so I have a lot of empty time. My girlfriend's schedule varies from week to week.


To stop from being bored I gained a part time job at a large French restaurant. They were not hiring servers at the time but had an opening in the coffee bar in their attached take-away bakery. I took the job to keep me socially active and busy.


Honestly I have a lot of fun in my part time job. It is not physically demanding and it is fun talking to people. I also like surprising people who think I cannot speak French because I do not have the air of a French person. When I tell them I am Vietnamese then it makes a lot more sense.


My girlfriend thinks that the fact that I basically work a fast-food job (I do not earn tips other than if people are generous and throw money in my jar) is shameful because I have a master's degree from a prestigious foreign university.


I don't mind and I don't think it's anyone else's business, and I'm not embarrassed of it.


I have befriended some of my coworkers and sometimes invite them to my apartment when I have a party (I have a big, three bedroom place). My girlfriend says that this too is inappropriate.


I just don't know what her problem is but she is saying that I need to stay in my class.


I was quite poor as a child so I don't really know what she's driving at. I think a friend is a friend, and a job is a job and I am grateful to have either.


My girlfriend says I should quit the barista job and find a more appropriate job.


What can be more appropriate? I have fun and am making some nice extra change, and am practicing my English.


Any advice on other jobs to get?

"My [24F] boyfriend [25M] always insists on driving around our walkable neighborhood, and gets upset and annoyed when I want to walk. He told me that it makes me look poor.


This is a really stupid problem, but I'm getting really fed up, and I'd appreciate some advice.

My boyfriend, Adam, and I are neighbors, and we live in a very walkable area. Most of what we need for day-to-day living is less than a five minute walk away. I don't really like driving, so I love it! 

Adam does like driving, and will almost always insist on taking his car when he goes out, even if he is heading somewhere really close by. The problem is, since this is such a dense area, parking can be a hassle, meaning that taking a car is often more effort than just walking. I wouldn't care if Adam just did this when he was by himself, but he also insists on driving when we are going out together, even though it often ends up being a problem. We will end up circling around looking for parking, only to end up a couple blocks away from where we were trying to go, so walking would have actually been faster and less aggravating. Adam will loudly complain about how annoying it all is, even though he was the one who insisted on driving. 

It escalated into us having two arguments about it recently. We were going to a festival that was about a ten minute walk from our apartment complex, and as usual, he said he would drive. I knew that parking was going to be a huge problem, and begged him to just walk with me. He insisted on driving, and we hit traffic shortly after we left. I tried to convince him to turn around and leave the car at home, but he kept sitting in traffic, so I got fed up and got out of the car, and walked the rest of the way. It was awhile before he was able to meet up with me, because he ended up having to park at an overflow lot and take a shuttle! He apologized, and I thought maybe he would finally learn his lesson.

However, we got in another argument, when we were going to the grocery store. The store is literally 2 blocks away. I've only ever driven my car to the store once, and that was only because I was getting a bunch of really large items that wouldn't fit in my shopping cart. (And it later occurred to me that I could have just borrowed one of the store's shopping carts, which are larger). Usually I just walk with my shopping cart (an oversized basket on wheels, like a suitcase) and sometimes a tote bag, and that's all I need, it's really easy!

I got the shopping cart ready to go, and Adam sighed and said we didn't need that, we would just take his car. I said we weren't buying enough stuff to need the car, and that it would be much faster to just walk, since we wouldn't have to deal with getting a spot in the garage. He got really pissed, and said that we can afford cars, we don't have to walk, we aren't poor, and that I didn't need to be dragging my sad little cart behind me everywhere. I told him I was going without him, and that I would beat him to the store (which I did). 

He did end up grudgingly apologizing, but it seemed like he was just trying to smooth things over, rather than changing his behavior. This is getting to be a really obnoxious problem, any advice on how to handle it?

Throwaway, though I am showing this link to my GF.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years and I love her more than anything in this world.  We don't live together, but I see her as often in the week as we can, which is about 2-4x a week.

One issue that we have had, is that I am unemployed.  I've worked corporate all my life, but left my company right before we started dating.  I own my own apartment and have no issue paying my bills and paying for dates.  But I don't have money for vacations and other expensive trips costing thousands of dollars.  

When we first started dating, we took one vacation together to Dominican Republic, with her mother and 13 year old daughter (she paid for her family flight and room and I paid for my own flight and room).  Since then, I have not been able to afford another trip.

About a year ago, I started to take up photography professionally.  A magazine found me and used me to shoot a spread for them.  That soon turned into multiple spreads in each issue, to then shooting celebrities for their cover.  Now this is not a huge magazine, most of you would never have even heard of it.  They are mostly local for some major metropolitan areas.  And because they are not a big company, I did these shoots unpaid.  But what I did receive was an amazing upgrade of my portfolio, as we shoot in amazing mansions and yachts, and I have shot some major celebrities that you would definitely know.  Also, I started to get sponsored by some major companies to use their gear for these shoots, giving me $20k in new gear so far.  Finally, the magazine has been offering to give me free trips for all the hard work.

To explain about these trips, basically there are resorts, hotels, etc that want to get written about in the magazine.  So they offer free flights and resort stays to writers of the magazine to get a mention.

Since I have been at the magazine, I have been offered a 1 week stay at a spa in Italy, as well as 2 other 1 week European stays.  They only offer 1 ticket, but I was told by staff that you can usually pay a ticket for someone else, and the hotel wouldn't mind if you have a second person staying in your room.  The resorts usually have a list of activities that they provide for you during the day, but then you meet up with your loved one at night.

I've turned down all the 1 week stays as 1.) Buying a ticket for my GF to Europe was just too expensive.  2.) I didn't want to be away for a week from my GF.   I was also offered a trip of a lifetime to go to South Africa for 2 weeks, with one of the highlights of that trip being a balloon ride over the Serengeti.  This trip is something you have to pay $10,000 or more for.  Again, I turned it down.

About a month ago, they offered me a trip upstate to a bed and breakfast hotel, so I accepted that one, and made the 3 hour trip by car with my GF.  We had a great time, though afterwards, my GF said it embarrassed her that we got the dinners for free.

I also went to Canada for 3 days/2night, with the editor in chief of the magazine, to shoot the cast of a TV show, but the shoot was canceled, so the editor and I just went to all these fancy restaurants the entire time there (again, everything was free).  I gained 10lbs. 

A little over a month ago, I was offered a trip to a beautiful resort in Jamaica for 3 days.  A trip worth about $4,000 with all the activities and inclusives.  This was exciting as I haven't gone on a ""vacation"" trip in almost 2 years.  I looked up flights for that trip and it was about $500 for another ticket.  So I signed up for it.  I talked with the PR people of the resort a few times.. and then waited.. and waited.. Not hearing back from them for 1-2 weeks.  Finally, a few days ago, I get an email with the tickets!  I immediately look online, and another ticket is now $1,000!  I can't afford that, especially for a 3 day trip.

My GF is PISSED.  She finds it unforgivable that I am going on a ""vacation"" without her.  I tried to explain to her that I don't have the money to buy her an extra ticket.  That the only 2 choices I have is to:

1.) Go on this trip, which is ""payment"" for over 100 hours of work I did for the magazine
2.) Not go on this trip, and waste the tickets, because we won't both be able to enjoy it.

Her reply is that a real man wouldn't go on a trip without their GF.  That this is not normal.  I said this is like a business trip.  The resort expected me to go to the activities it is assigning me to and then write about it as well as take photos.   It is totally 10000% normal.  She said that it wasn't.  That she has broken up with every other boyfriend that has ever gone on vacation without her.  

Now something important to note.  My GF has gone on 3 vacations this year without me, with her mother and daughter.  2 trips to Florida and 1 trip 6 hours away to the lake.  She has invited me on all 3 trips, but I couldn't afford to go, so I had to decline.  She knows I couldn't go because of the cost.  Additionally, the trip to the lake was only supposed to be for 1 week, but then she kept extending it for longer and longer.

So to me, the fact that she is able to go on trips with no issue without me, but has an issue with me going without her, is really troubling.  She says no, that she invited me to go with her on her trips, it's not her fault that I couldn't pay to go.  I replied that she is 1000% invited to go with me on my trip, but there is no way for me to pay for her to go!  

I've asked her how we can solve this issue.  What does she want me to do.  She won't give me an answer.  She has no solutions.  No offers to split the cost of the trip, no offers of any kind.  Just complaints after complaints making me miserable and honestly, dreading this trip.  When she went on her vacations, I was sad and missed her, but I supported her and was 100% loving the entire time.  When she kept extending her lake trip, I was resentful that she had no issue spending more and more time away from me, but again, I never expressed that to her in any way and just told her that I missed her terribly and hoped she was having fun.

So.. r/relationships.  What should I do?  Am I in the right?  Is she in the right?  

**Update**: My GF has read what I written and said I cast her in a bad light.  I replied I am showing the exact facts.  My GF does love me, and I love to be with her. It kills me that she won't be there with me.  I will miss her the entire time and wish she was there with me.   But this argument is ridiculous.  The fact that she is being so unsupportive of me and trying to ruin my trip, while I have always supported her trips is really troubling to me.  Additionally, she is INSISTING that this is not a work trip.  My response is that while this is not a conventional work trip, where I will be sitting in meetings in an office, this is still technically one as it is provided by the company, and I will have responsibilities while there.

  **tl;dr**: Going on a work/vacation trip and my GF is upset that I am not taking her.  What should I do?"
"UPDATE: I [39F] am concerned about my husband's [40M] relationship with his coworker/subordinate [24F] at the boarding school where we all live and work.


Previous discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4raao3/i_39f_am_concerned_about_my_husbands_40m/). It didn't get tons of attention, but it was helpful to air out the issue, and anyways I know people love reading about scurrilous drama on the internet, so here we go.

School is starting back up again and faculty are reconnecting and mingling after a summer largely spent away from campus. Grace was a no-show; apparently over the summer she got another job and moved to a city several hours away. Good riddance. The apartment down the hall has been taken by a single middle-aged biology teacher with whom I've always gotten along. Awesome.

But, through a series of events as convoluted as they are boring (very long story short: someone told someone else who told me), I've learned that Chris has been not nearly as forthcoming about his relationship with Grace as I thought.

Basically, Grace and my husband sloppily made out at several faculty gatherings. He was always drunk when it happened and it it never went beyond there. The same could not be said for Grace's friend ""Amy"" who's around the same age as Grace and also teaches in their department. On one occasion drunkenly Amy and Chris sucked face in the backseat of a car with two other coworkers in front. They then made their way to Grace's apartment, where they stayed the night. Chris had told me he was going to be staying with a buddy of his so they could go hunting the next morning.

Why couldn't they go back to Amy's place, you ask? Well, because at the time Amy was living at the headmaster's house. Because she's his granddaughter.

I confronted Chris about this and he came clean right away. He said that he had enjoyed receiving attention from these younger women and had been attempting to re-live his 20s by partying with them. He said that they reminded him of a younger version of me. (Which I can see: Amy, Grace, and I are all skinny, flat-chested brunettes with shoulder-length hair.) He said he had been drinking far too much and losing control of his boundaries. He was, he claimed, too ashamed to tell me. I want to believe him.

Right now we're keeping things quiet. Boarding school politics could make this a very complicated situation, and I am still debating whether I want to stay married to Chris. I love him and we have two terrific kids to whom we're good co-parents, but I have never known him to keep things from me and I'm not sure I can trust him again. Once a cheater, always a cheater? I'm not sure.

"(Update!) My [37M] much younger BF [24M] has a daddy kink and I'm not sure if I can go along with it


Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51suqf/my_37m_much_younger_bf_24m_has_a_daddy_kink_and/?st=iswt04nq&amp;sh=b2f8b3a1

Kind of silly to update something like this, but I figured why not - a few people asked.

I wrote out a note to my boyfriend that basically said ""I'm sorry for being an insensitive dick, I'd like to talk about your kink if you're up for it"" and passed it to him after dinner. Luckily, neither of us clammed up and we were able to talk it out.

He told me he has different wants out of the dynamic, but ultimately, he wants more praise, more physical affection, and to be taken care of (he summarized with ""daddy kink but not ageplay""). He also mentioned discipline and chores and things, but that was more of an afterthought. We'll be talking more in-depth later on this week, but so far, I'll be happy to provide what he wants and needs from me.

We also talked a bit about my age insecurity, but he assured me he loved me for me, not just because I was an older guy. Thanks to everyone for telling me the same thing haha

I'll be heading over to other communities to get help there, rather than bug you guys again, but thank you for the responses on the original post!

**tldr: who knew communication was important. boyfriend told me what he wanted, and I can provide!**"

"Me [28F] with my fiancé [29M], together 6 years, last night he secretly gave me a sleeping pill


Hi. So this sucks. 

I've been with my fiancé, Ken, for 6 years and engaged for 1. As everyone always says, the relationship is (was?) really good, very happy, he's great and all that jazz. 

Except that I'm furious at him and have fuck all clue what to do right now. I've been having trouble sleeping recently. Ken gets up much earlier than me most days so yesterday I asked if he could do me a favour and bring me a coffee in bed when he got up and made his, basically so the shot of caffeine could force me up and I'd be really tired by the next evening and actually get some proper sleep. He said yes. 

Yesterday evening as part of that 'help me sleep' campaign Ken offered to make me some warm milk to drink before bed. I figured it was worth a try and it was sweet offer so I said yes. It tasted kinda nasty and I thought he might have burnt the pan or something, but I didn't want to be rude when he was trying to do a nice thing so drank it and didn't complain. 

Lo and behold, a little while later lying in bed I actually felt quite drowsy, but also a bit nauseous. I got off to sleep an hour or so earlier than I usually manage though so that was good. Obviously the title of my post has given away where this is going. 

This morning I got up and we were chatting, and I commented that I was surprised the milk kinda helped, I thought it was a bit of an old wives tale. Ken was really pleased it'd helped and asked if I'd want to try it again. I said maybe, but I'd like to find another way because it also made me feel quite sick, I guessed because I don't usually have a lot of dairy. 

Then he just kinda blasé-ly revealed that he'd put a sleeping pill in my milk so perhaps I could just take the pill and not have the milk. I blew up at him. I try not to raise my voice in arguments and always be respectful, but honestly I was - still am - fucking furious. He argued that it was just an over the counter pill so couldn't have been dangerous, I'd asked for his help with this by bringing me coffee and this was additional help, and it worked so why was I so upset? I don't get how he didn't goddamn understand that it's about giving me something in secret, not what it was or what it did to me. He's not a stupid man, I can't believe he needed this explained to him. 

Anyway he eventually apologised but I was incredibly angry with him still so I left and am sitting in a coffee shop. He will be going to work soon and won't be back til late this tonight (we both work shifts). I am posting here because I really feel embarrassed to talk to friends/family about it right now. 

I guess for reference he's asked me if I wanted to try sleeping pills before, and I said I'd give it a couple of weeks of doing good sleep hygiene and stuff like that and if the insomnia was still bad I'd see my doctor for advice. 

I don't know if this is forgivable or what. We're planning our wedding, we have all these life goals together and I love him. If someone had done this six months into a relationship I'd absolutely break up with them, but 6 years seems like a lot to throw away on one mistake. But it's a fucking awful mistake. I keep swinging between being furious and then feeling incredibly sad when the thought of breaking up enters my mind. I don't know where to go from here. Is there a way to fix this? Should I try to fix it or did he go to far?

Tl;dr: my fiancé put a sleeping tablet in my milk last night without my permission. He told me this morning. We had a massive argument, he eventually apologised but I walked out anyway because I was so angry. Don't know if I can/should forgive this. "
