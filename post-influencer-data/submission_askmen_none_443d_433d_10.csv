"What are some of your favorite traditions you and your SO have?


Whether it be something you do every day, night, weekend, month, year, etc.

My girlfriend and I's favorite food is any kind of breakfast item. We fucking love breakfast food, on an almost Ron Swanson/Leslie Knope-esque level. Anyway, we were searching for a breakfast spot one saturday morning around town, and everything had a long wait, or sounded really unappealing - like IHOP. So we decided to swing into some hole in the wall cafe we'd seen a million times. Best. Food. Ever. We go every single Saturday morning without fail now. We always get the same waitress, who knows our names and brings us our coffee and water right as we're taking our seats. It's our own personal heaven, and it's the perfect reset switch for both of us after long weeks of work and other life stresses. We sit and tell stories, sip our coffee, eat our omelettes and pancakes. Looking at her across the table every saturday morning always makes me think of how much I love her and the things we do together. It's the one ultimately meaningless activity we have that helps us connect, and I love it. "

"Wife/GF: “What are you thinking?”


Anybody else’s SO ask this question quite randomly? If so how do you answer? 90% of the time I’m genuinely thinking nothing and the other 10% is probably the same type of random thoughts most 7 year olds have!

How do you answer it?"

"What are some misconceptions about being an attractive guy?


First of all, it's way easier to find casual sex partners if you're an attractive guy than if you're average or unattractive. There's no denying that.

Dating though, that's only slightly easier. You still have to deal with ghosts, flakes, girls (or guys) who think you're cute but don't like your personality/lifestyle enough to pursue you, being led on, situations where there's mutual attraction but one of you is too shy to express/reciprocate interest, awkward/shitty first dates, missed connections, unhealthy relationships, being used, etc. The only difference between that and being average/unattractive is the frequency at which all those things happen. Being attractive doesn't automatically give you a fulfilling dating life or a dating life in the first place, it isn't the ""get out of singlehood free"" card some guys think it is."
"What is the most accidentally insulting thing you've ever said to a woman?


I'm a tutor for my college's athletic department and this summer I've been tutoring some football players in Anatomy and Physiology.

So the boys I tutor were learning about bones and I was trying to get them to remember that every time you see ""osteo-"" that probably means bone. One of them mentioned osteoporosis because their girlfriend's mom just got diagnosed with it, so I used that as an example. I explained the condition to them, why it's more common in women, how it can have genetic factors, etc. One of them asked if there are ways to prevent it, so I told them I've heard calcium supplements and weight-bearing exercises are good. 

One of them went home and told his girlfriend- with no context- that she really needed to start working out more. I don't think she was amused. What's the dumbest/most insulting thing you've ever accidentally said to a woman? "
"What do you think about AskMen having age-group flairs?


I think it would be a huge benefit to many of the discussions if we knew the age group of both the OP and those who join the discussion. I was scrolling through the top posts and I came across a post where the guy was having issues in life and I have absolutely no idea if any of the responses are from anybody above the age of 30 or if they were all in high-school. 

Everybody deserves to contribute to a conversation but in a lot of cases the advice provided are for their age group whilst the OP may be a lot older or younger and therefore the advice provided may not be as helpful to them. "

"Men, what are your thoughts on (non-sexual) role reversal?


(19/f)

I love buying my men flowers randomly, I love spooning them (even though I'm 5'2 and all my boyfriends have been taller than me), and generally just buying gifts for them and being gentle with them. I love doing this because I sort of have this protective instinct with men, and also partly because I don't believe men are treated as gently as women are, or at least as much as they should. (I've got a lot of strong opinions on societal expectations for men but I'm not gonna get into that here)

I'm not talking full on GFD, although that is something I'm interested in as well. I'm talking more subtle, non-sexual acts of affection. I mention things like buying flowers because although it isn't all that weird, it's mainly a tradition for men to buy them for women so it's just not as common. 

Men, what are your thoughts on this? Would you enjoy this? I tend to date men who love it, so I only really get one-sided opinions."

"Why is the ""college experience"" so valued by people when choosing colleges?


I've always been very confused when people choose to go to wildly expensive schools or choose to live at a school that's within 30 minutes commute from their parents home for the ""college experience"". 

I went to community college out of high school and got an associate's/trade degree (paramedic) so I never lived at a college or anything like that. I solely picked that college because of price and the quality of the program. 

This question was sparked by a coworker of mine talking about how she has over 70k in loans already from her daughter who is a sophomore at a state university. The coworker pays tuition, off campus housing, sorority dues, and just laid out 15k extra for her daughter to spend a semester in Australia (her degree has no reason to study abroad) the coworker used the ""well I want her to have a proper college experience"" to justify all of this.

I wanted the opinion of people who did, or didnt, go away and live at a school, did this ""college experience""(or lack of) improve you? Was it worth the extra money to pay?"

"What's something about this community that you dislike?


For me, it's the fact that whenever I bring up the fact that I'm terrible with women, whether it's me lamenting the situation or just making a light hearted joke at my expense, I usually get at least 3 or 4 comments comparing me to Elliot Rodgers and that community. It's impossible for me to put into words how much I hate this comparison, because I absolutely despise that community, which I shall not name, and all it stands for. I've seen this in other subreddits too such as /r/askreddit but it seems to be worse in askmen"
