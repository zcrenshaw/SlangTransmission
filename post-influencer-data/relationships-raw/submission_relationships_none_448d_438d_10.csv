"[UPDATE] I (30f) just found my fiance (30m) on an online dating site. What do I do?


Original Post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8w5vf1/i_30f_just_found_my_fiance_30m_on_an_online/

I posted a few days ago because I found my fiance on an online dating site. I took reddit's advice and catfished him...

A few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted.

When he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up.

Long story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account.

He obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me.

I fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure.

I apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago.

He offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another ""trust but verify"" type of situation.

Tl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile. We talked it over, no one is mad. Life is good."
"[UPDATE]: My husband's [27M] fear of getting me [25F] pregnant was a lie to cover his affair.


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8qdjdf/my_husband_27m_has_cut_off_almost_all_intimacy/?st=JJDO4QMO&amp;sh=8915171e


Last post was about my husband of 2 years distancing himself from sex out of fear of getting me pregnant. It turned out he's been having an affair pretty much our entire married life! 

We'd been together for 7 years all together, so when I kicked him out the night I found out, it was painful. I filed for divorce and he didn't fight me on it. 

I'm working on finding a smaller place. I don't need a large house for a big family. I know I'll date here and there but when it happens it'll happen just not yet. 

I'm wanting to see the world and go places I've never even thought I would go. I've been holding back and no longer will that happen. 

Sure I'm going to miss him but it'll fade eventually as I learn to love myself. 

**TL;DR: Filed for divorce. Working to fix myself.**"
"[Update] My [21,M] fiancé [35,M] does not show me any respect in front of his friends or family.

Thank you for all the responses and concern with my original post. I think when I posted it, I knew how messed up my situation was, and I am seriously thankful that you all gave me the push I needed to get out of my relationship with C. 

I called my mom just a few hours after making that post. I was so worried that she wanted nothing to do with my anymore, but right when I said that I needed help leaving C, she got in the car during our call and headed my way. You all pointed out how silly it was for me to think my family would not take me back, and you were right. 

I did not intend on telling C that I was leaving, but he came back home to pick something up, and I had a few bags packed. He became more desperate than angry. He did grab me and bind my hands while yelling at me, and he was physically blocking me from leaving the room, but he did not get any more physically aggressive than that. 

After tiring himself out from yelling, he just pleaded with me to stay. He promised me that we would set a date for the wedding. He also tried giving me money, and that was odd. He literally started pulling out cash. I had never seen him so desperate, and it changed the way I see him overall. He had always seemed like the most well put together guy possible, but he isn't, and I am disappointed in myself for falling for his lies. He gave up after my mom got there. I am very glad she arrived when she did. 

I still love him. I cannot lie to you all about that. This is still fresh and I am sure these feelings will fade, but a big part of me is already missing him. I know that it is messed up, but I want to curl up beside him. 

My mom hugged and kissed me more than she ever has when she picked me up. She had some pretty strong words towards C, but overall, we left without much trouble. The ride back home had a lot of tears on my part, but it was good to catch up with my mom, and she gave me a lot of good advice and comfort. She even made me fish &amp; chips when we got home. :)

I wanted to jump right back into seeing friends again, and I got to hang out my best pal from grade school. Many of my friends still live in our hometown, so that is nice. My friend was glad to see me. She took me to a late night movie, and that was great. I had not been to a movie without C and his friends in a long time, and he only goes to an arthouse theater that typically bored me. I never got to decide what C and I did when we went out, and having this feeling of freedom is great! I know it is silly to put so much significance on seeing Incredibles 2, but it made me happy. 

My friend even took me on a super late hike on one of my favorite trails. She is a sweetheart, and I am glad to be able to hang out with her again. She already wants to find me some hot guy our age to have some fun with. I am not sure if I will be ready for that anytime soon, but it does sound exciting, and I'm glad to know that my friend is that ready to hook me up and all. She says that she thinks it may be good to have a little fling, nothing serious, but just some muscled young guy to get my mind off of C, but I don't know. 

Many of you pointed out how terrible it was that he did not want me to go to college. I was planning on going to school for Computer Science or do like my dad and go to law school. You are all probably right about him restricting me out of an attempt to make me more dependent on him. I am going to start applying to college, and this is exciting for me. 

C does keep calling. I know many of you suggested that I block him, but I have not done that step yet. I have responded to him only once though. He just keeps trying to offer me things. I've never even expected him to give me much money or gifts. It is strange that he is resorting to basically bartering with me. 

I am going to visit my sister today, and I look forward to seeing her again. 

It is going to take me away to drift back into normalcy, but I think I have taken some great first steps into taking care of myself. 

Tl/dr: My mom picked me up from his house, and aside from a little aggression and desperation, it went well. I am living with my mom and dad for now, and I am already seeing friends again. "
"LDR girlfriend tore up gift I [17M] handmade her during an argument to show me ""how I can easily hurt you"". Not sure how to procede.


TL;DR Girlfriend tore up during an argument a gift I personally made her and I'd put all my heart in. I can't bring myself to talk to her now. Trying to figure out if this is the last straw for me or not.

I've been dating this girl for 6 months now, we're in a sort of LDR (350km). I got used to preparing a little gift each time I visit her, which has ranged from a drawing with some quotes to a necklace. 

I visited her yesterday for the last time before I go on holiday with my family. I didn't have much time to prepare anthing spectacular this time though. She is very afraid of me doing something bad on my trips, so I decided to make something to reassure her. So I picked up a piece of paper and folded it in half. On the lower half, I stitched our best picture together. On the top half, I drew an anchor (kind of our symbol) and wrote a promise of how I am going/am not going to behave on the trip (things such as ""we'll talk on the phone at least 1 hour per day"", ""I won't hook up"", etc...).

This morning we were arguing about something that I thought we had gotten past. When I thought she had calmed down, I told her to look at the thing I left on her desk yesterday. She took the piece of paper, looked at it, read it, and told me it was awesome. She then jokingly told me that had she remembered it while we were arguing, she would have tore it up. Half an hour later, we're arguing again. We then got quiet for a few minutes, she started avoiding me and I pulled out my phone to read a text. Then I hear her saying ""If I wanted to hurt you yesterday, I would have done it like this"" and she tore up the gift I'd made her without even thinking about it. She then left the room, and I quickly picked up my things and left to catch the train back home without even thinking about her. 

I was livid, and I still am. She immediately started calling, and an hour ago I had like 80 texts and 8 missed calls. I can't think of anything good about her right now. I know it may sound exaggerate, but I put my heart in the little gifts I give her, especially in the handmade ones. I feel hurt, and I can't bring myself to read those messages or call her back. 

For the first time I'm actually considering breaking up with this girl. Do you guys think this may not be worth a break up? If not, I'm still unsure on how to go from here. This event plus a couple previous ones are really making me doubt this relationship.

Thanks in advance to those who'll answer me."
"[UPDATE] My brother [29M] wants me [20F] to pick him up from an airport 5 hours away. I don’t want to. Am I being unreasonable?


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8wxitg/my_brother_29m_wants_me_20f_to_pick_him_up_from/

Repost because my first update got deleted for some reason. Really wanted to let those of you who replied to my first post what happened because you were all very helpful!

I made the original post a few days ago but I didn’t think it’d blow up like it did. I’ll admit, for the sake of anonymity I left out some important details. Not only is my brother not from our town, he is from a different country. It is a bordering country. This is important because he lives in LA and our town is just south of Montreal, Canada. Basically he can save money on his flight by flying domestic. You can probably see where this is going... he wants me to not only pick him up and drop him off, driving 5 hours each way, each time, but wait in line to cross the border, not once, not twice, but four times so he can fly from LA to NYC (~$350) rather than from LA to Montreal (~$600). I would then have to drive from Montreal to NYC, pick him up, and drive him back. Rinse and repeat after the reunion. So yes, everyone was right, he was being a jerk in even asking.

I don’t want to be a doormat but I also wanted to avoid saying outright that he was being unreasonable and I didn’t want to do it. Half because I didn’t want to cause any drama before the reunion and half because I wanted to avoid him telling my relatives I didn’t do it because I was being a terrible sister (not that they’d side with him).

Irrelevant but my mom’s been working pretty hard lately. So... I booked a full day at the spa and hair salon for my mom and I, paid in full, and to my brother I said — “sorry, but I already have plans for that day. Mom and I are going to the spa and hair salon. It’s a surprise for her since she’s been working so hard lately and if we cancelled, our cancellation fee would be almost as much as the $200 you’re saving. Could you catch a Greyhound? If not you’ll have to ask someone else to drive you.” I knew he’d go to my mom next if I said no to driving him so I thought this would knock out putting pressure on her if he did.

He whined and nagged and eventually just asked me if I could drop him off after the reunion. Though this was a slightly more reasonable request I was still annoyed he’d asked in the first place, so I said “sorry but Grandma and Grandpa need me to help clean up their house after the reunion, since there’ll be over 20 people there they’ll need a hand getting everything cleaned up.” As expected he tried to play the “family card” but I reminded him that Mom and Grandma are family too (gasp.. no way!) and that I owe them a hell of a lot more than I owe him. Petty, I know, but I’m feeling like he deserved it. He still hasn’t replied to that so he’s probably pretty salty. Oh well! Thanks for the help everyone!

TL;DR not driving my brother. My mom and I are going to have a spa day instead!

"My husband [32M] wants to quit his job now that I make a decent living. I [29F] had to work even while studying


My husband is a simple guy who means well for the most part however he was spoiled rotten by his parents and had very much a centralized ""me"" mindset where everything revolved around him and how things benefited him.


We worked through most of that and got married last year. 


One of the hurdles we had to overcome was my desire to go back to university. At that point he felt I already had a degree and didnt understand why I wanted to do this. 



I dont want this post to be too long however I've always had a direct career pathway and this was my dream. I felt I could do this. Work part time and put myself through my studies 


He didnt agree with it but was okay with me returning to study under the condition that I continued to contribute/pay half of the household expenses - groceries/Bill's. 


I lucked out in that my old boss loved me and wanted me to get my advance/2nd degree, they offered me a weekend job at amazing ""over time"" rates (working sat and sun paid similar to working 4 weekdays)


It was still incredibly stressful working weekends and studying full time for 4 years. I hardly had any time for myself, i worked 6 days a week over breaks etc but I managed and I survived 


I graduated few months ago and I now make 3x what we made combined before. It's great. We can afford fiber things now and I'm happy to share this with my husband. 



Last month George approached me and revealed hed like to quit his job. He hates his job and he doesn't think we need his salary anymore. 


It's true his salary doesn't mean much to us anymore outside of maybe his own fun money.


However I dont feel comfortable taking on the burden of financially supporting us when he had such little faith in me before.


He expected me contribute equally while I was studying an incredibly difficult degree. This meant many many sleepless nights. 


Yes he was emotionally supportive but he didnt help financially and he could have. He could have supported us financincially to reduce my stress at the time but he didnt want that. He wanted us to carry our own financial burden 


I find it hypocritical that now that it suits him, he wants to quit his job.


He doesn't even have an idea of what he wants to do. He wants to basically take a gap year to decide what he wants as he feels exhausted.


Again, I find this insulting given I'm the one who had to work my ass off for 4 years 


Hes trying to guilt trip me by talking about how much he hates his job and basically begging me to let him quit his job and I really dont know what to do


Part of me feels guilty as I want him to go find what makes him happy instead of be stuck in a job he hates. However the other part of me really resents him and how handled my situation. 

How do I navigate this ? Any advice would be appreciated 


Tl;dr: my husband wants to quit his job now that I make great money. However he didnt give me that luxury when I was studying full time "
"[UPDATE] My [24F] boyfriend’s [27M] student [20F] is coming onto him but he doesn’t see anything wrong with her actions since she credits him with her academic success


The first post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8w1du9/my_24f_boyfriends_27m_student_20f_is_coming_onto/

TL;DR from first post: Boyfriend is a professor who has a student crushing on him, won’t do anything about it since it makes him look good as a professor, am I allowed to say how uncomfortable it makes me?

I want to start by thanking everyone for the comments. So many of you made it clear that this was a much bigger problem than just my feelings on the matter, and this is what I led with when talking to Samuel about it.

The same night as the night I made my post, he brought up how during that day Karen had once again taken up nearly his whole open hour session talking about something inane and not related to the academic topics. He said he felt bad because he could see students waiting outside to talk to him (exam results have just come out and his open hour should have been spent talking with as many students as possible about their marks) but Karen showed no signs of shutting up, and he wasn’t going to insist that she leave because ‘she’s my ticket to staying in this job’.

As politely as possible, I snapped. I told him that if he carried on with this relationship with Karen then he would be losing his livelihood as well as me. I explained, as so many of you did, how both his peers and his students would be viewing how Karen acts around him, and how if Karen were to cry wolf and tell someone that ‘Professor Samuel’ made a move on her or that they were even in a secret relationship, then he would be kissing goodbye to his job with hardly a second glance.

He was quiet for a while, but then said that he had been an idiot. He said that because he knew that he would never allow anything romantic to occur with Karen or any of his students, then he didn’t view what was happening between himself and Karen as inappropriate. I asked him what he was going to do, and he said that he would be going straight to one of his closer colleagues to explain the situation, and shutting down as much communication as possible, with nothing outside of the direct academic topic ever going to be discussed.

It appears like we had this moment just in time. Samuel came to me today and said that he had had a conversation with his colleague over text. He never named Karen, however said that it had been brought to his attention that he had managed to get himself into a situation that could be misconstrued as inappropriate. Straight away the colleague mentioned Karen, and said that it had cropped up in conversation between members of the department that Samuel had prioritised her. The colleague also said that they weren’t aware of any chatter among the students about Samuel being in a relationship with Karen, but did know that Karen herself had been overheard saying that she knows he dates students (namely, me, though see the original post for all the reasons for why our relationship is permitted). The suggestion was made for Samuel to make an appointment to meet with the head of the department in order to get his side across before anything else happens, and this is something he is going to do.

I’m really glad that this has turned out this way. Of course Samuel could be sacked on the spot by his boss, but we can’t see that happening. The fact that Samuel didn’t try to further justify himself or attack me for my comments shows to me that he really was just being ignorant of his situation, and the fact that he is working as hard as he can to clarify him actions to his higher-ups shows to me that I have no reason not to trust him.


TL;DR - Told boyfriend that he was being an idiot about our relationship and his career and he agreed. He’s prepared to nip this is in the bud and explain himself to his bosses before it gets out of hand. As happy an ending as we could hope for."
"My [25F] downstairs neighbor [33M] brings me dinner every night


TL;DR My downstairs neighbor prepares me dinner every night and delivers it to my door. He is very nice and genuine but after a few weeks of this I am starting to feel guilty and unsure of his intentions. 


A little background, I live in a 3 unit house in a very friendly, open community. My downstairs neighbor is a refugee from Burma/Myanmar and he is  very friendly. He has been in the country for over ten years now, originally living in upstate NY, going through a long drawn out divorce, has two sons, operates a couple sushi stands at grocery stores and practices Buddhism. We both moved in in May. I recently got out of a 5 year relationship and moved very suddenly and abruptly. I live alone, work and support myself and have two dogs. I am an introvert and generally keep to myself. Moving to this new community has forced me to be more social. 

At first he brought home sushi and bottle of wine for me. He also brought home sushi and beer/wine to all our other neighbors as well. He seemed very grateful to be here and was thanking all us for welcoming him. In addition, he mows the communal lawn, planted a garden, takes care of the garbage cans on trash day and does general chores around the property. He goes above and beyond as a tenant. 

When I would be out in the yard with my dogs he would always offer if I wanted leftovers. I would always politely decline. Well his sons, 6 and 12, have been here visiting for the past couple weeks and since they have been here he brings me dinner everyday. He will either catch me going to take my dogs out or come and knock on my door with dinner and sometimes more wine. When my dad was here dog sitting he even brought my dad dinner. To be clear, it is a full balance plated dinner - meat, veggie, grain. Not just whatever is left. 

Originally, I thought it was super nice and that he probably has leftovers from feeding his sons. I also thought maybe it was a thank you for letting his sons play with my dogs in the yard or for having kids around. Or he sympathized with me because my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me. 

Now I am not sure how I feel about it. I'll tell other people and they think it is weird or that he likes me romantically. He seems very hung up on his divorce and still calls it a ""break"" even though they have been separated for three years. So I do not think that he has romantic intentions but I still worry. Mostly I am concerned because I feel guilty. This guy does not make a lot of money, has two kids, lives in an illegal basement unit with no stove top or oven and brings me dinner every night. 

Is this guy just a generally nice person? Should I be concerned? Should I decline? I try to avoid him so he does not feel obligated to feed me but he just comes to my door. I think he means the best but something is just not feeling right. "
"I've [28M] really bonded with my niece [13F] over our love of music. She emails me her works occasionally and I give her advice. Gf [24F] thinks it's ""creepy"" and wants me to stop all contact.


My niece is 13 and really wants to go to music school. She's played piano since she was 5 and has recently started to branch out into different instruments. I've never been that close to her since she was so small but her dad (my brother) encouraged her to reach out to me recently since I work for a multinational production company and have experience in the industry if she ever wants to pursue music seriously. I've won some awards myself but nothing major but I can really relate to her love of music especially in high school. 

In the past few months I've given her tours of my company and let her meet a lot of interesting people. She's also started to email me some of her composed works which are honestly very impressive. We don't have any contact other than email. She'll ask me advice on things like which competitions to enter or what organizations she can join for people her age. A lot of the times I'll refer her to some of my colleagues on things I don't know well. I'm in contact with her dad pretty frequently as well so I get updates from him too. Both he and his wife have been very grateful and has offered to take me and my girlfriend out to dinner multiple times. 

My girlfriend finds all this very weird and has said multiple times that it's creepy that I've emailed my niece and that it's creepy I've taken her to work with me. I tell her it's not that big of a deal as my coworkers have loved meeting her and my bosses have all told her that they'll keep her in mind whenever young adult programs pop up in the company. My gf though thinks it's all really inappropriate and recently she asked me to stop all contact since it's freaking her out and all her friends think it's weird too. Is it really this weird? I feel like maybe my gf is overreacting but looking for outside opinions. 

**Tldr:** I've been emailing my niece and taking her tours of my company as she's a budding musician and wanted to get to know the industry. Gf thinks it's all very ""creepy"" and wants me to stop all contact. I don't want to but is it really creepy? Gf says all her friends think I'm weird and it's bothering her that I haven't stopped. "
"My (31F) boyfriend (33M) is LIVID I asked him why he doesn't want to add me on Facebook


So last night he mentioned adding a recent new friend we made to Facebook. I asked him if he was finally ready to add me since he added the other person and he totally lost it. I feel this is a huge over reaction and I'm really not understanding it.

We've known eachother 8 years, been together 1, he posts pictures of me on his Facebook, but is livid when I ask if we can add eachother? Like he essentially ran out of the restaurant we were at, didn't even wait for me, wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night and this morning told me not to talk to him. I told him this makes no sense and asked if he could explain his behaviour because I'm confused, and his was response was that he's ok with that.

Then he left.

I'm so confused about his reaction to this... I'm hardly on fb and wouldn't have brought it up if he hadn't mentioned the other guy... But he did so it was like hey, why aren't we friends?! To be this level of nasty... Over that? I really don't get it.

**BOLD** *TL:DR* Boyfriend is livid and won't talk to me after I asked about adding eachother on Facebook after he added someone else recently. "
"[UPDATE]Coworker in HR [30sF] with me [24F]. She told an employee not affiliated with HR about my confidential sexual harassment case


Link to OP: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7q7jjc/coworker_in_hr_30sf_with_me_24f_she_told_an/)

**TLDR**: I left the company. Fuck yeah. 

I'm always reading updates and I'm always in awe at how much support people are willing to give, and I'm so glad to have been on the receiving end of that support, so thank you.  When I initially made the post I was way too scared to actually leave my company, but reading all of the advice and generally shocked/angry responses really made me evaluate my situation.  It's been about 5 or so months since my last post, and I always love a good update so here goes. 

About 3 months or so after I had found out HR was leaking details about my sexual harassment, a coworker completely unrelated to my team/work came up to me and had told me that my manager was telling her he was unhappy with my work performance (this was not in any sort  of professional setting/purpose/meeting, they were having a conversation as friend to friend). I had known he was dissatisfied with my performance for some time, as we had talked about it, but what really angered me was again, that toxic culture where employees share information to other employees who are not privy to that information. I was especially disgusted because my manager had given me the most support during my sexual harassment. That was definitely my last straw, and that's when I started looking to get the hell out of dodge. During my job search I started realizing how underpaid and unappreciated my work was. There was no room for growth. 

As of today I've signed a new offer letter, with a 35&amp;#37; salary increase from my current pay, great benefits, good title, and work that actually interests me with opportunities for actual mentorship. Of course I won't burn any bridges with my current company, I'm going to tie up my work, hand off what I need to, and make it as smooth and professional of an exit as possible. I want to thank you guys again for all the advice you have given me. It took awhile for me to come around, but I finally did it. And I'm excited to move upward and onward. 

I feel oddly sad, guilty even. It almost feels like leaving an abusive relationship. I felt guilty for leaving for so long so I put up with toxic coworkers, a hostile environment, and shitty pay for an extra 5 months longer than I had to. I feel free now, but at the same time I feel a little melancholy. Thank you all again. "
"I [24F] want to back out of my best friend's [25F] wedding


A year ago, my friend (of 14 years) asked me to be her bridesmaid. I said yes, but told her honestly that I could not afford much and that my hard limit was $400. She said that’d be fine since she was planning a very low-key wedding.


Yesterday, one year away from the wedding, she texts me to tell me the cost as a bridesmaid is now expected to be around $800. She had changed her mind about some things, including that she now wanted the bridesmaids to have hair and makeup professionally done. I told her that wasn’t feasible for me, that I had told her what my limit was, and she suggested I speak to the maid of honor (who I met once many years ago) about expenses. 


So, I sent her a message. MOH sent a very nasty response back to me, saying that a good friend would learn how to budget and would save up for their best friend’s wedding, that nobody WANTS to be a bridesmaid-- they HAVE to be. She said that she managed to budget as an undergrad, so she knows I can afford it if I want to. She also told me that the bachelorette party is going to be a weekend in NYC (something that was never discussed with me or other bridesmaids) and that she expects me to attend and help pay for it. Also a bridal shower gift, a wedding gift, and my outfit (dress, shoes, hair/makeup) for the wedding.


The thing is, not only has the bride doubled my budget, but my financial situation has changed. I got injured at work a few months ago. I have been off work for 2 full months, have being going to physical therapy two times a week, and am currently waiting on an MRI. Meanwhile, I’ve also recently been diagnosed with depression and am spending a decent amount of money working through other mental health issues. 


Upset by the MOH’s message to me, I showed it to the bride. She wasn’t sympathetic and apparently agrees with MOH. She thinks I can easily budget for her wedding if I want to, but she also has admitted that costs might go up even more as the wedding gets closer. She also told me that, as the bride, she is ""not supposed to be dealing with” bridesmaid issues.


Additionally— The bride and others live on the east coast, I don't. I can fly for free due to my job (benefits that will be declining the longer I am off work), but I am not willing to spend my time and money on a weekend in NYC whether or not flights are free. When I agreed to be a bridesmaid, I was under the impression that I would not be expected to attend pre-wedding events since I live out of state. 


After receiving a bullying novel-length message from the MOH, and after the bride basically told me that she expects me to spend twice my budget on her in order to be a “good friend”, I no longer want to be a part of the wedding.


Am I the one who is being unreasonable? Is there a way to back out and salvage the friendship before too much damage is done? What's the best way to handle this situation?


Tldr; Close friend of 14 years asks me to be her bridesmaid, but ignores my budget and tells me to just “save up” for her wedding and accept whatever future costs may come up. My financial situation has changed, but I am still expected to fly out for expensive pre-wedding events and have received a nasty message from maid of honor about my inability to budget. I no longer want to be a part of the wedding, but don't know if I'm being unreasonable."

Thank you for all of your advice on my last post. Plenty has happened since then. He went on the trip with my family, but I took what everyone was saying in and evaluated the relationship.

He had a plan for a future, and I wasn't fitting into the plan as nicely as he hoped. I stopped bending to the pressure he was placing on me (according to him, he never pressured me). I told him I wasn't going to just move in with him after everything that had happened (not taking the move in off the table entirely though) and pointed out that I was the one making the compromises.

I was the one who would have to commute over an hour to work. I was the one who would be responsible for cooking, cleaning and groceries. I was the one who would have to relocate for his work, effectively ending any career I built. I was the one who always contacted him first.

He picked the apartment closest to his work (one that was also in spitting distance from a train station). He had his great plan, and I felt like I was getting squeezed to fit. So I told him that until we managed to both be a bit more secure, both more established in our fields, and both able to rent a place between our jobs, we should Skype and visit each other on weekends. I have a car, he could get a cheap train ticket. It would have been doable.

It didn't fit his plan, and he didn't like the idea of making this compromise. But he promised to try, and saw me for the last time before job training on my birthday. He didn't really speak much to me (and I didn't get any gifts either, before you ask. Writing, meet wall).

He waited a few days before starting up the conversation on the phone with winning remarks like: ""I would have followed you if you got the job first"", ""You changed the plan and now I'm left dangling"", ""I don't have a car, so how would I visit you"", ""I feel like you don't love me anymore"", ""I bet your parents poisoned you against me"", etc. There was no way to win, so I stopped playing the game.

We broke up. It sucks, and I feel like I wasn't worth the $15 train ticket to see. Three years just wasted. I'm trying to be mature about everything and not insult him. Is there a good way to get over this?

**TLDR: He went on the trip, but we ended up breaking up. Is there a good way to get over this?**"
"I [28M] have noticed some odd stuff from my wife[29F], over thinking things?


So I spent a weekend away with some friends and when I got back I found a couple odds things that I'm not sure if I'm over thinking. The back drop to all of this is we have been married for about a year and a half and the last year has been rough to say the least.

What I found:

A pair of men's boxers in my drawer that are 100% not mine, brand I never buy. This one speaks for itself.
Found a receipt for 2x tickets to Jurassic World in my driveway the day I got home. There was a name on the receipt and it was my wife's boss. The thing about this is that I asked her what she was up to while I was gone and she said she saw the movie, but with ""work friends"". The fact I found a receipt for 2x in my driveway that has someone else's name on it is weird.
In addition last few months I have found some lingerie in the wash, the kicker being we are candidates for /r/deadbedrooms.

All of this together has been thinking some bad thoughts, but I am willing to admit I could be making a mountain out of a mole-hill.

Thoughts?

**TL;DR** found boxers that aren't mine in my drawer and 2x movie tickets with my wife's boss' name on the receipt in my driveway after being gone for 5 days."
"Someone who I thought was a friend (F33) invited everyone in our group of friends to her bachelorette party except for me (F29). I’m really hurt and I don’t know what to do.


Hello,


So as I stated, this particular friend is getting married in October and had her bachelorette party this past weekend. I had no idea it was going on, and only found out when she posted about it on social media and tagged the rest of the girls in our group of friends. I was the only one who was not invited, and although it sounds silly, my feelings are really hurt. When I got married (almost) 2 years ago, I invited her to my bachelorette party and she attended. It’s worth noting that I am invited to her wedding and already rsvp’d. 

Most of my group of friends live about an hour away from me in another city. They all live much closer to one-another than I do to them. I do my best to make it out to things like birthdays and baby showers and parties, etc but it’s hard to meet up for casual dinner or coffee, since I live an another city and don’t drive (I’m working on the driving thing). I try and stay in touch as much as possible through social media, but I know that isn’t a substitute for being there in person. I’ve also been dealing with a bad bout of depression recently (my friends are not aware as I do not want to burden them or be stigmatized), and I’ve withdrawn a bit while trying to work on my mental health.  It is also worth noting that I came into the friend group about 9 years ago because I started dating my husband and he is friends with some of their SOs. Other girls joined the group over time as well, after me, through their boyfriends/husbands. 

This situation has also made me sort of wonder if maybe they don’t want me around because I’m not in the same ‘social class’ that they are. I’m a few years younger than the rest of the group, and while they all have very professional careers and advanced degrees, I just have a BA and I work in marketing at a car dealership. They all own homes and are starting families, and I’m just not quite there yet. I graduated university post-recession with a ton of debt that I’m working on paying down, and my current job is the first one I’ve had where I have been able to make a solid 50k plus income (note that this is pennies compared to what these women and their husbands make). They organize things together where they have gone on vacations or cruises and (although it’s embarrassing)I just can’t afford that at this point in my life. I know that in the next couple of years, my husband and I will be able to purchase a home and start and family but for now we are just kind of ‘behind’ everybody else. I feel like maybe they just see me as not good enough. 

I want to make it clear that I’m genuinely a measured and rational person. I’m not planning on doing anything dramatic like no-showing for the wedding, or calling her out on social media, or confronting her. I have to see her and our other friends next weekend for a birthday party and I just don’t know how to interact with them since I feel really hurt. Should I just accept that I’m not good enough for these people and drift away from the group? We all used to be so, so close and would go awhile without seeing each other but would always come back together like no time had passed. I spent some of the best times of my life with these people. Now, I feel like I’m being shut out because the distance and our lifestyle differences are becoming more pronounced as we get older. I don’t really want to go to the party next weekend now, but I already committed to it, and I shouldn’t necessarily be mad at all of the girls, as they didn’t create the guest list for the bachelorette, they just attended. What should I do to feel better?

TL;DR
Got left out of a friend’s bachelorette party and I’m hurt and questioning my friendships. How should I proceed?

"Husband (35) has a weird relationship with coworkers wife and my (32/f) ex friend


Ok where to start with this. My husband (35) is incredibly hard working, and has been able to achieve significant success in his career, through luck but also through busting his ass.  As such he is in a position in his career that most men don’t achieve till they are in their 50’s.  Financially we are very well off.

About a year ago we moved to a new city for a career opportunity for him, which we were both excited for, even though it meant leaving our friends and family behind, we did not know anybody in this new city.  When we moved here we were introduced to one of my husbands colleagues, who is at a similar position in the company, we’ll call him Dave.  Dave is very successful and smart but older (60ish) and honestly not very attractive.  His wife Natasha (30) is young, and very beautiful, energetic, tho immature... this might sound callous but it’s obvious that their relationship is not necessarily based on love, more of convince.  She doesn’t work, spends lots of time traveling and shopping, and Dave lets her pretty much do what she wants, as he works so much.  They don’t have kids.  Something to note too, Dave ended his first marriage, of 20+ years,  leaving his wife for Natasha.

When we moved here Natasha brought me into her circle of friends- who she mostly attend church with.  It wasn’t my crowd but it was very lonely moving to a new city without knowing anyone.  Natasha and I began hanging out more, though I would never call us close though.  She would often complain about Dave when we met, and issues with his health/behavior typical to that of a 60 y.o.       When I talked about the stuff my husband and I would do- hiking, dancing, traveling, or going out together I could tell she got a bit jealous.  I did not do this on purpose but she would ask what we did true past weekends, etc, etc.  As two couples, we and our husbands together, would also spend time together, dinner, theater, etc.

A little while ago, Natasha and Dave, invited us to join them for a few days in Hawaii where they had rented a house.   The place they rented was beautiful and huge, and they said that it was on them, which was more than generous.  When we arrived, Dave spent most of the days sleeping, reading, etc.  Where as Natasha, my husband and I would go hiking, go out, and do activities, this was decided before we started the trip as Dave likes to spend vacations relaxing while we are more active.

I felt a shift during Natasha at this time, as she clung on to my husband all the time. He is a good looking guy- and she would constantly compliment him, his body, his muscles, all the time.  She was also very physical with him, and take his arm when walking, hug him, etc.  My husband would also pay for everything while we were out, meals, trinkets, drinks (he felt he should as they paid for the rental) which added to the weirdness of the situation, as it felt like he was her surrogate husband in some ways.
One night the three of us were out dancing and Natasha started grinding up on him and laughing.  They danced closely for a bit till I asked to cut in, I could tell Natasha was annoyed.  I didn’t want to ruin the vacation so I said nothing, but felt hurt by her actions.  
When I confronted my husband about her behavior he just said she was having a laugh, and it was harmless, and they were just friends.

When we got back from vacation, I consciously decided I would distance myself from her, not instigating hanging out together as much.  It was hard, bc most of the women I had met were from my relationship with Natasha.  About a month after we get back though my husband asks me if it’s okay if Natasha come round for dinner- what?! Apparently Natasha had been texting my husband since we got back.  I looked through his phone and it’s innocent enough, mostly her complaining or asking advice or asking how he is but still weird esp since we haven’t talked as much.  I confront my husband about this, and he says that they are friends as well.  He also decides to tell me that after we got back Natasha dropped by the office to see her husband (who was conveniently in a meeting) and dropped in on my husband- they went for coffee, where she told him she was seriously depressed and valued his friendship.  My husband told her that if she needed anything he was there for her.

Anyways Natasha comes over for dinner and it’s beyond awkward as she pretty much ignores me the whole time and is all over my husband- it’s like I’m watching two pple on a date.  My husband tries to include me, but I’m also just beyond done and spend the night pretty quiet.  When Natasha leaves she gives my husband a long hug and asks him about grabbing lunch that week at work- wtf?!

I am done with my friendship with her but my husband feels bad for her- esp since she confided in Him about her depression, and wants to keep the friendship, also since his relationship with Dave is important.  He just thinks that I am being mean and thinks Natasha is just playful nothing more.  I told him I thought it was weird about Natasha txting him and Him not telling me they met for coffee but he says that he felt bad disclosing what she told him. 

I am not sure what to do- give my husband an ultimatum? Try and est a friendship with her again?  So that she leaves my husband alone?

TLDR:  Husband (35) has a weird relationship with ex friend

"I (25F) just lost my nannying job because I wouldn’t return gross sexual advances from the kids dad (42M). My husband (25M) is livid, but is 5200 miles away and feels helpless.


No, I cannot report the incident- I was hired under the table with no proof of working for them, and there is no proof of any incidents. 

My husband is stationed in Korea for another 4-5 months out of a 13 month tour, and I have withheld everything going on of this nature at work for the last few months because he would just stress about things he can’t fix while overseas. Finally, enough was enough, and I let the kids dad know that his behavior was unwarranted, inappropriate, and unwelcome. 

Aaaand now I am jobless. He cited in the *text*  at *10:30pm the night before I worked at 05:30am* that he wanted a better connection with the person watching his kids, and that he didn’t feel as they were being played with enough and that I was immediately relieved of the job in the group text with him, his wife, and myself. It has taken everything I have in me to not send back something snide or rat him out to his wife, but I know if I do this in anger it won’t end well and chances are, she will think I am just bitter and making things up. 

Then again, I’m sure there is a reason I was their 4th nanny in 1.5 years. 

I feel like I made a mistake telling my husband the truth about what happened because of his rising stress level, and there is literally nothing he can do. He keeps saying things like “if I was there, *insert action.*” then gets upset because he realizes he can’t do anything about it, aside from getting the dads wife’s number from me and calling her himself. I don’t know how to soothe him from this far away, especially on top of my own stress now. 

We are now also completely strapped financially. We don’t have a savings, as we were putting *everything* towards debt to try and get out of it before he came home, which, in hindsight, was probably not the best idea to live without a buffer. I was supposed to start back to school this fall, but that’s out the window with no financial support to throw towards that. I live with my MIL and the job market is insanely tight here. I have no friends. He won’t be able to come home and visit for his midtour because I am not willing to put the $850 we had bought a plane ticket with towards something other than bills at this point, so that flight is getting cancelled and refunded. So it’s either ruin everything we have worked for this year with paying off debt and raising credit scores and use the money for a plane ticket, or be apart even longer and be miserable and alone for the rest of his tour. I haven’t seen him in so long. I miss him terribly. I am so incredibly sad even thinking about him not coming home like we had planned. 

I don’t know what to do. All I want to do is cry, I am handing out resumes like candy literally anywhere possible. It seems like just when things start working out or looking up, they fall down farther than the hole we started from. 

I don’t know if this is even the right sub to post in, but I have nowhere else to turn and I don’t know what else I can do right now. Any advice or good vibes are always appreciated. 

tldr; my boss made sexual advances towards me, I’m now jobless for refusing and my husband is livid from 5200 miles away. "
"My girlfriend (23F) declined my proposal and it's all my (23M) fault. How do I redeem all of this? I know I fucked up. UPDATE.


Original - https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8vib7b/my_girlfriend_23f_declined_my_proposal_and_its/

I don't think anyone wants this update, but I thought I may as well because every single comment helped me. Some comments really fucked me up tbh, because I knew you were right. It hurts to read the truth sometimes, and even though I was sure I had fucked up, I didn't realise just how shitty I was behaving.

I knew my girlfriend and I were distancing so I booked a holiday for her to come here and thought this is it, one last try to see if we can fix anything. She came and she was happy to see me, the first day was a bit awkward but it got much better after that. I cried, she cried. I told her I understood where she was coming from, and how sorry I was for not realising sooner. I didn't realise the amount of pressure I was putting on her in the relationship, I was just comfortable (and an idiot). She, like always, responded perfectly. She said she forgave me and she was waiting for me to come to her with an apology, she wasn't angry or anything. I love her so much and I made sure she knew this. She gave me a fantastic weekend together and I was so happy.

We talked about everything. Literally anything that had gone wrong, we made a plan to fix things. I am sorting my shit out. Finally. No more excuses (thank you Reddit for making me see that), no more being afraid to disappoint my mum. I just want her. I was so close to losing her and she admits she wanted to leave me but couldn't find the strength to. I'm not sure what made her change her mind this weekend but she did say she's giving me one last chance. She's given me far too many chances already but she's so god damn perfect she found enough hope to give me just one more.

I've sent off my passport. We have made plans for the future. I've opened up a savings account I will not touch. I won't spend the money I used to on stupid shit. I want to finally get my ass on a plane and visit her country, and visit so many other countries with her as well. I don't know if any of you will believe me, but I truly mean this. Sometimes it takes a scare like this to realise what you have, and I can't believe I ever acted so selfishly. I've told her this over a hundred times but I am truly so so so fucking sorry for how I've behaved. I've finally found the strength inside me to be a much better boyfriend. She's helped me a thousand times before, it's my turn now to be her rock.

Thank you Reddit, the comments really did help (even the worst ones). It's now my turn to save the relationship, and I'm giving it 110%. I love her too much, I want to be the best possible boyfriend to her. The boyfriend she deserves.

tldr- I booked a trip for my girlfriend to come and see me, we talked and cried and tried to fix everything that's gone wrong. We've made plans for the future. I am changing for her, I want to be the best possible boyfriend. And I will be. She's giving me a final chance."
"My (28f) brother in law (23m) drunkenly hit on me at a family BBQ over the weekend. I am very seriously considering keeping it from my husband (30m) because of the rift it would cause, rather we just limit contact again. Am I thinking correctly?


Back ground (I can amplify as needed): My husband had a huge falling out with his family and we are just now speaking to them after about 2 year pretty much NC period. Of course it's easier to my husbands side of things but if I'm being fair and objective as possible the fracture was about 70% his moms fault and 30% my husbands...what is however undeniable is that the ""golden child/scapegoat"" thing that MIL does with my BIL and husband is the source of all the trouble. My husband just didn't react well to the last thing that she did 2 years ago. The fight two years ago came about when my MIL sold ""husbands"" car and gave all the money to BIL (it's not fair to say it was just a car, my husband and his now deceased dad had built it as a muscle car from the ground up when husband was a teen). It particularly stung me because we had settled on a new house we were buying (my 2nd choice by a long shot) because we would finally have room to finally store the car with us. In the 9 years I've known my husband, we have a blow up like this every six months or and I think there have been worse things they've done, this is the one that he could not forgive. 

So fast forward to more recent time periods, MIL stopped by our house pretty much out of the blue. She seemed very genuine in her apology and she said she had sold some stock recently and had a check for my husband for the full amount of the sale of the car. She said she was very sorry and she didn't realize the car meant so much to him but that it was killing her to not see our kids (3 and 6 months now) and she was willing to do whatever it took. Husband was not home at the time but I told her I'd pass the message on but I couldn't promise anything. So he ended up calling, they patched things up as best as possible after all the history and we agreed to come to their house for a BBQ on Sunday afternoon. 

It was actually a very nice time, they can be a very fun family and kids were happy to see their cousins and 2nd cousins, we played poker, swam, ate lots of meat and potato salad...all in all a very nice typical small town summer BBQ. Of course there was alcohol and there were a couple of people that really over did it but didn't seem to be a problem at first. 

First of all BIL hit on he and husbands cousins wife but it was more of like ""you're so pretty how did cousin ""earl"" land you, you're too pretty to be from around here. What's a city girl like you doing here"" I mean gross but harmless things. My husband and his two cousins threw him in the pool and from there he passed out and it seemed like he was down for the night. 


I hadn't realized he woke up and I was around the side of the house throwing some things away and all of the sudden I turned around on the narrow sidewalk (house on one side, fence on the other) and he basically had me cornered. I said something like ""oh ""Bobby"" didn't realize you were awake, you need something?"" He then reached out to grab one of my breasts and I sort of batted his hand away and then I don't remember exactly what he said but it was along the lines of ""I love big milk filled titties."" In the moment I just thought it was stupidly funny so I told him that they were for his 6 month old niece and I don't think she'd want to share. He then said ""well she doesn't have to know about it and again reached out to grab me."" I don't even know how I did it but I just reacted and really before I knew what was happening I had my forearm against his neck with his back pressed against the wall to the house and told him that if he ever said anything like that me again I would kill him and he better pray to god that his brother didn't find out. I've never taken karate or anything so I have no idea how I did it or why I chose that move but it seemed to work because he started coughing and saying how sorry he was. I told him to go inside the house and don't come out until I was gone, which he didn't do. 


We left an hour or so later and I was on such an adrenaline high that I'd actually been sort of physical with someone (and won, I guess!) that it didn't really sink into me what had actually happened. I sort of came down later in the evening and had a really hard time sleeping last night but was pretty much back to normal this morning as I got my husband off to work and settled in to my normal SAHM activities.

But now I'm not sure what to do, I am seriously worried that after my husband's freak out over the car two years ago, his brother trying to do that with his wife may seriously put him over the edge into doing something absolutely drastic. And it would certainly end this little spate of peace between he and his mom (his mom would unquestionably take his brothers side, I've seen it too many times to think differently). So I'm almost thinking, I handled myself appropriately, I scared BIL enough that he did not come back outside and this situation is over with. Along with that, I can say that after BIL hit on cousins wife I don't think he's appropriate to be around our kids. Husband would have no issues going along with that and if we want to have MIL over she can come here, and if we want to have family gatherings we can do them at our house...but as long as BIL is living with his mom, we aren't going over there for any reason. 


Basically having laid that all out, am I thinking correctly? 


That I save my husband the stress and the potential trouble and we again severely limit contact and then only if it's on our terms?


TL;DR: BIL drunkenly hit on me at a family BBQ. I am seriously considering keeping it from my husband because of the near constant family drama his family puts him through and I'm afraid of his reaction. My solution is that we just severely limit contact (again) with his family and even then it should only be on our terms? That's my solution, am I thinking correctly?

"UPDATE: I [18/F] just found out that my boyfriend [18/M] wrote an entire full-length novel on the two of us before we got together


og post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8wqwiw/i_18f_just_found_out_that_my_boyfriend_18m_wrote/

First of all, wow! I was completely overwhelmed by the amount of responses I received. I was fully expecting two comments but instead, so many of you guys took the time and effort to write out positive and reassuring responses to my post. Thank you all very much!

About an hour after I posted, I realized that I was being an idiot and getting freaked out over nothing. I mean, I have a boyfriend who took the time and effort to write an entire novel based around me and as someone very eloquently put, he didn't *just* whack off to me. That's pretty rare and I should definitely be extremely appreciative of him. 

Now for the update. So he ended up sharing the book with me on google docs. I read the entire thing in one sitting and let me tell you guys, it is *pure gold*. It's not only very well-written with a complex plot and great character development, it portrayed the two of us in an extremely practical and realistic light. What I mean by that is not, it was not 200 pages of WWII sex (although there was a bit ;)), but instead he really took the time to build his character and my character so that our romance seemed tangible and real, despite many differences we had throughout the book. He could probably publish it. 

I was impressed as fuckkkkk. 

Now the question is...how in the world did I convince him to let me read it after how he reacted the last time I asked? Turns out, I wasn't completely honest with you guys but in my defense, I had totally forgotten about it. I found out the next day, after digging through some of my old stuff, that I too, wrote a story about me and him. Mine was definitely not the length or complexity of his. It was only 23 pages in google docs and was basically a trashy YA novel (that I never finished) set in your classic high school setting where he was the shy kid in the back of the classroom and I somehow managed to seduce him. And oh god is it embarrassing. But I was willing to sacrifice my pride and ego by proposing a trade to which he happily agreed to (although with some convincing). 

So in the end, he read mine and laughed and I read his and cried because it was so goddamn beautiful. 

TL;DR: Turns out my boyfriend is the Ken Follett. Read his novel in one sitting, became immersed in the plot, cried at the end. Damn am I lucky to have a guy like him."
"My (23/f) mother (60s/f) is mad because my husband ((26/m) and I set boundaries


Hey guys. I just wanted to get some outside opinions on this situation because I’m having a hard time. 

TLDR is at the bottom. 

My husband (let’s call him Isaac) is 8 years sober. My step father (Dan, 60s/m) is an alcoholic. Last year, my mom (Lynne) ended up in the hospital, and in a moment of familial closeness, Dan decided to come clean about a previous incident. 

He told us that he had given my very sober husband an alcoholic drink two years ago when we were visiting. At the time, Isaac was hesitant to drink it because it tasted off, mentioning that he was sober and trying to confirm if the drink had alcohol in it. 

Dan and Lynne both said it didn’t, and so he drank it. 

After Dan came clean, Isaac was very upset. Rightly so - he made the comparison of if someone had slipped me a roofie, we would be similarly upset. 

Isaac set some boundaries in order to make sure we could keep these people in our lives, as I didn’t want to completely disconnect from my mother, and Dan is a package deal if I want to be with her. 

His main boundary was that they could not spend the night in our house if they visit, and when we visited we would also get a hotel. He basically wanted space if he needed it. 

My mom now wants to visit, and wants to bring Dan with her. I explained the boundaries, that she couldn’t stay in our house. I offered to pay for a nearby hotel, as we would still love to see them, we just wanted a bit of distance until trust had been reestablished. 

Lynne went through the roof. She at first was civil, but then called me back like 20 minutes later completely yelling at me, saying we were in a delusional bubble that meant we couldn’t deal with anyone who wasn’t perfect. 

I want to maintain the relationship with my mom, but she can’t accept the one boundary my husband set. 

Am I being unreasonable by siding with my husband? Is he being unreasonable by asking they stay in a hotel?

**TLDR** ; my step father gave my sober husband an alcoholic drink. Now when we request that they stay in a hotel while visiting, they attack us and say we’re being ridiculous."
"My[22F] boyfriend[23M] believes everyone is out to get him re his blond hair


We have been been together for one year recently, but been good friends since our childhood. I do remember as a kid he has strikingly blond hair, like almost as if on flash and fairly glaring. It’s nice hair though, healthy and thick. 

Early into our friendship which developed mid teens, I realized he had a pretty big “thing” with his blond hair. He was angry because he felt no one took him seriously due to his blond hair. He cringed every time he was referred to as “the blond one”. I distinctly remember when he failed an English essay and attributed it to his teacher hating his blond hair. He once dyed his hair black but the ridicule from our classmates led him to bleaching his hair, making ridicule worse, then shaving it all off and starting over blond again. 

This was kind of one of his big quirks and when we first started dating I’d actually started to forget about it, it was almost like he’d outgrown it. And it was never a huge deal anyway

But now it’s become obvious that he’s not over it. A few weeks ago I became suspicious of bf after a dinner we had for his work colleagues. I noticed that one woman, who’s name I’ve heard a few times, automatically connected to our WiFi and that was the first time I’d met her. I got really worried and logged into his computer which yes I know it’s a bad thing to do. 

Well what I found on there was not what I’d expected—I saw an email from a different coworker referencing some sort of lawsuit my bf was involved in. To be clear, he has never told me he has anything like this going on. So then I called that coworker who I happen to run in the same circle as. 

She tells me my boyfriend is accusing his old boss of discrimination—that’s right, for having blond hair. And that the lawsuit is the reason my bf was fired. I knew he had a job change recently but not anything else. 

Is this super weird to anyone else? 

**TL;DR: my boyfriend has a real problem with himself because blond and is projecting that onto other people **"
"My [25 f] boyfriend [32m] of 3 years grabbed me violently in public and now I dont know what to do


Sorry if this post is a mess.

We were at a restaurant about to make reservations for tonight. We're standing in the lobby which is a narrow hallway, my bf is to the side while im in the middle of the corridor. We haven't had any arguements prior - we'd already tried to make reservations at a few other places that were full, but we're both alright, or so I thought.

I'm just looking around when my bf suddenly grabs my left arm violently enough to yank me to the side whilst telling me to stop being in the way. I look around and there's literally no one there. It's a busy place but I didnt bump in to anyone and I wasn't in the way of the waiters either.

I'm in shock by how violently he grabbed me and how much his grip actually hurt, and just plainly tell him ""that kind of hurt"", I didnt really know what to say. He then gets in my face and says ""for fucks sake voltage, did it really hurt that fucking bad? I cant fucking believe you"" and storms off inside the restaurant.

I just walked straight back home, and I've been sitting in the bathroom for twenty minutes crying over how fucking weird this situation is. What did I do to deserve that? I didn't do anything, and I'm not the type to cry foul every time we argue over something so I don't understand him being so annoyed. He followed me outside the restaurant asking me if I was going to get upset now and I literally said nothing and just walked home trying not to cry in town. He's standing outside my bathroom door now telling me how sorry he is.

Did I overreact or did I do anything stupid? Please tell me if I did... I'm so fucking confused and I dont know what to do. All I know is that it fucking hurt and I was not expecting him to get in my face.

**tl;dr my bf grabbed me inside a restaurant lobby and yelled at me when I asked him about it, Im crying in the bathroom and dont know if im overreacting**"
"[UPDATE] My [21 F] roommate [23 F] won’t allow my boyfriend [23 M] to come over.


[An update of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8tkalx/my_21_f_roommate_23_f_wont_allow_my_boyfriend_23/)

To recap: my roommate (Jane) won’t allow my boyfriend (mike) to come over. I was afraid of retaliation of my roommate’s boyfriend (John) who was also one of my closest friends. 

Hooooooo boy. Things got messy. 

One night Mike and I were at a nearby friends house, drank a bit, and walked back to my apartment so we didn’t drive inebriated. The next morning we walked out, and Jane immediately left when she saw him. We left for a planned weekend trip after a bit.

Jane texted me asking to talk, and then got pissy when I mentioned I was out of town for the weekend. When I got back, I locked myself in my room and texted her because I’m bad at confrontation. She insisted that I left for the weekend to avoid talking to her, and that I have been sneaking Mike in all week (not the one mistake). 

I stated that this is unreasonable, I pay to live here too, and my therapist offered to talk out this situation in a neutral space. 
The next day I discovered that John, and 4 other people blocked me on all social media. Nobody would reply to any texts or get back to me.

We scheduled a time to meet with my therapist, and went. Jane and I talked out the situation, and we came to an agreement that Mike wouldn’t come over while Jane was in the house for one month, so Jane could finish up her intensive therapy. She was also supposed to meet with him in a neutral place to get coffee or food and make positive associations. 

In addressing the “friends” that blocked me, Jane said that she can’t control the actions of others and my therapist urged her to try to talk to them and explain the situation. Jane excused their behavior with “they’re all hotheads”.
A mutual friend of all of these people told me he has “no fucking clue what’s going on”

We’re supposed to meet at the end of the month to reevaluate. 

One friend wanted to re-add me to the dungeons and dragons (dnd) chat, and John said he doesn’t want me there. 
Apparently others also vetoed my rejoining.
I asked Jane to talk to people again, with he same response. “I can’t control other people’s actions.”

As per the recommendation of my therapist, today I confronted John. He’s been in my apartment a lot lately, and stomping around and angry when I’m around. 
The conversation went as follows, while roommate jane is hugging/attempting to comfort John as he yelled at me. 

&gt;Me: “What’s going on? Why are you so upset at me?”

&gt;John: “I don’t owe you an explanation or any of my time.”
Me: but we were close friends??!?

&gt;J: we were. But then I decided that I don’t want anything to do with you.

&gt;Me: can I have some sort of explanation or something I can do to remedy this situation?

&gt;J: I don’t owe you shit. There’s nothing you can do to fix this. I’m not going to tell you what’s going on. 

&gt;Me: I don’t want someone hostile in my home-

&gt;J: I’m not hostile

&gt;Me: I don’t want someone who hates me-

&gt;J: you’re assuming I hate you. I never once said I hated you. I just want nothing to do with you ever again. This conversation is over.

&gt;Me: I live here, and I want to at least remedy this situation so there’s not somebody stomping around my apartment. 

&gt;J: my partner lives here!!

&gt;Me: I live here. 

&gt;J: and my partner lives here. 

&gt;Me: It takes so much energy to be angry continually. 

&gt;J: so?

&gt;Me: I generally try to tell people when they misstep so I can resolve the situation peacefully. 

&gt;J: well I’m not you. 

&gt;Me: and I’m not an ass. 

&gt;J [as he slams the door]: YEAH, IM THE ASS
I can hear yelling as I go to my room. Somehow I didn’t cry the entire time. 

I can't afford to pay the fee to break my lease, so i have no idea what to do. 

TL;DR: shit hit the fan, people want to be angry for no reason, jane is taking a passive role. I don’t feel welcome in my home."
"I [22F] just found out my terminally ill father [55M] has another life with 4 kids!!


I feel like screaming till I lose my voice. 


I dont know what to do or feel.


My dad has been battling cancer that has spread to few organs for the last few years. His medication is working for the most part. 


Ive done so much for him. Ive attended all of his appts and have been helping him in anyway possible. When hes sick I'm there right next to him to help (he can't speak English well so he needs help with translation) 


I cant believe hed do this. Im shaking. 


I randonly got a call from him. I answered and kept saying ""hello, hello"" but all i could here from the other end was two young kids making baby noises. Then i heard my dad talk with another woman and 2 teens. I couldn't tell how old they were but they called my dad ""dad"".


He talked with the woman as if they were together. 


Their todler who sounded like was playing with the phone had somehow called me and they didnt realize i was on the other end. 


I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. My parents were together last time i checked and now i find out he has 4 other kids with this other woman!!!!


I hate him so much. Few years back something had happened to make me suspicious and I confronted him and I told him if what I suspected was true I wanted nothing to do with him and he swore up and down that he was hurt Id think he was capable of such thing!!!


I know for sure hes with another woman and has 4 kida because I confronted my aunt who apparantly knew about it all along. 


Mum said she didnt know but she suspected and because hes sick she doesnt want to push him away from his kids.


Which is the biggest load of crap Ive ever heard. He still acts like theyre together and treats my mom as if shes there to serve him. She cooks for him and does anything he needs etc.



So he took full advantage of us while he had a whole other family on the side !!! 


I wish him so much ill at the moment and want to yell at him and tell him to go to hell. That i wont even visit his funeral. I want nothing to do with him or his other bullshit family. As far im concerned i have no father hes already dead. 


My mom doesnt want me to do this. She says it will destroy him. She says he loves his kids and that he loves me deeply and that if he lost me hed be sick and might even stop his treatment all together as he can be quite depressed. 


I dont know what to do. I want to leave and never look back again. Im so angry and sad. I cant stop crying. Hes not home obviously hes staying with that b**@@@ for couple of days by the looks of it. Arhhh i cant believe hed do this. 



How do i detangle this shit. Id block mum and him if I didnt have siblings (not the half bullshit sob that are his kids) but my siblings are still home and I dont want to cut contact with my siblings (theyre underage) 



Tldr; my father is a sob who has another family and kids - the works. But hes also sick though stable might die in 5 years might die sooner might day later. To me hes already dead. I dont know how to move forwards"
"I [30M] am not sure how to feel about my (soon to be) brother-in-law’s [30M] actions during his bachelor party


This past weekend was spent celebrating my (30M) soon to be brother-in-law’s (26M) bachelor party on a cruise ship. It consisted of 15 guys, the majority of which I am unfamiliar with. Most of the guys, other than my three cousins, are my brother-in-law’s childhood friends.  

My sister and her fiancé have been dating for four years and I feel I’ve got to know him pretty well over that time. I hang out with them every few weeks and he’s always been a great guy. Very polite and kind and you can tell her really cares for my sister and family. So when it came to celebrate his upcoming marriage to my sister, I couldn’t be happier because I love the man and she has found a great guy. But after this weekend, I’m not sure how to feel and could use some guidance. 

The bachelor party cruise consisted of lots and lots of drinking and drug use. No problem for me, as I enjoy both, especially when the occasion calls for it. My brother-in-law told me to not to judge him for a particular use of a drug but I honestly didn’t care because I partook as well and drug use doesn’t bother me when it’s done somewhat properly. But here is the thing that did bother me about this trip, the cheating amongst some of the guys in the group, and most specifically my brother-in-law’s incredible flirting and touching with some of the women there. 

There were about six men in the bachelor party who were in relationships, and I’d say each and every one of them, in my opinion, crossed many lines within their relationship, or just plainly cheated on their significant other. In the end I couldn’t care less what these guys do in their relationships but when it came to my brother-in-law I didn’t really like his actions.

He did some very heavy flirting and dancing with some women on the cruise. This happened on every day of the cruise. One of those women even came up to me and whispered in my ear, “Do you know what I hate? Marriage”. Even when sitting down to rest he was touching girls and trying to get them to sit on his lap. I don’t mind some dancing with other women who aren’t my sister, but I generally feel something was crossed. I certainly wouldn’t want my fiancé dancing like that. And I also feel that had I not been on this trip, just him and his buddies, he could have cheated. I didn’t see him kiss a girl but of course I wasn’t babysitting him the whole time. 

At this point, I feel kind of weird about the trip. Maybe because I was the only one who chose to not cross a boundary in my relationship but I just don’t know what to do about my brother-in-law. Do I tell my sister about some of his actions with the women or do I just keep it shut because it was a bachelor party? Is this something I can discuss with my girlfriend? I’m not really sure what the right thing to do is because I deeply care for my sister and my family, who is paying the entire bill for the upcoming wedding. 

**TL;DR:** Spent this past weekend celebrating my brother-in-law’s bachelor party on a cruise with 15 of childhood friends. There were moments in the trip where my brother-in-law danced and flirted very heavily with other women on the cruise, even getting them to sit on his lap and jus touching them in a way that made me uncomfortable. I know for certain my sister wouldn’t be comfortable with that, nor would he if she was in his position. Do I tell my sister about this or do I keep it shut because it was a bachelor party? Is this also something I can discuss with my girlfriend?"
"My cousin (23M) ruins every party he’s at and expects me (21F) to be his social support.


My cousin, fiancé (21M) and brother (19M) all go to the same university in our state. I just graduated from a different university and will be going to theirs to do a masters program while my fiancé finishes up his undergrad. We’ve been long distance since high school and fiancé is in the marching band there. This is a party school and the band does their fair share. Whenever I would visit, we would have a party we could go to. 

Cousin is also in the band, but he is not well liked, because he is pretty obsessive and rude. He literally calls himself by the instrument he plays. This is fine, like what you like. But he called one girl a whore to her face and openly talks about how he hates others in the band. 
He is also noticeably insecure about a lot of things, which I think is part of why he’s lashing out. He is very obese, despite their conditioning and everything. He has switched his major three times to avoid a certain math class (essentially college algebra). 

The main issue is, whenever he’s at a party he drinks essentially a whole case of beer by himself, gets drunk and starts screaming about nonsense. If he sees me he acts like we’re best buddies but if I don’t spend every moment with him he follows me around, threatens to tell my parents I’m drinking and accuses me of doing drugs. He texted me one time after leaving a party “fuck you you rat bastard”. He is also always mad if he sees I’ve visited my bf without telling him I was in town. It just is leaving me drained and I haven’t been to party where he’s there since. He has also started trying to party with my younger brother too who has just started college and isn’t super comfortable with the whole party scene yet.

I talked to my parents about his drinking and behavior and they’re essentially like “yep that sounds like [cousin’s name]”. I’m really not sure what to do. It’s not my responsibility to make him lose weight or be a better person but how do I enjoy my time during my masters while he is also there.

TLDR: Cousin is rude and insecure and wants me to be his best friend whenever I visit him but lashes out if I show any disinterest."
"My [21,M] fiancé [35,M] does not show me any respect in front of his friends or family.


I met my now fiancé, C, when I was seven-teen. I worked at a store he owns, and we became close fairly quickly. I had just moved out of my parent's house, and C was the first person other than my friends that I came out as gay to. 

He was super friendly, smart, and handsome, so I thought that I had hit on a lucky head in life. My friends were weary of him at first because of our age difference, but overall the beginning of our relationship went well. 

C proposed after almost two years together, and I really thought I was lucky to meet the love of my life so early. Our relationship has pushed many people out of my life to a degree. My family supports gay rights and all, but they do not like C, and they do not really want me coming around if he will be with me. 

The engagement seems to be at a sit still. I have no clue when we will actually get married, and C claims to be ""too busy"" to discuss it most of the time. C is also being totally unsupportive of me, and he insults me constantly, especially in front of his friends. 

An example that happened a couple weeks ago is when we had guests over. We were eating dinner, a dinner I cooked, and C and his friends were talking about politics, as they always do, and I chimed in. I did not really disagree with any of them. They were talking about the Paris Agreement, and all I said was that it bothered me that many of my favorite animals are dying because of climate change. One of his friends interrupted me and asked how I knew what I was talking about. C said ""he doesn't."" He laughed at me. 

What did I do to get put down like that? Maybe I did not add some grand point, but I wanted to be a part of the conversation. I rarely get to see any of my friends anymore, so his friends are all I really have. 

C has called me his ""ditzy house husband"" to guests. How is that fair? I cook, clean, garden, and do whatever he asks of me, but I just get called dumb. 

I asked him over the weekend to start showing me respect and that I want to know that he sees us as equals. He ""didn't want to hear it."" 

I try to relate to him. I know I am not as capable and bright as he is. He is smart and successful, and I respect that about him. But I feel like I do so much, and instead of getting thanked, it feels like I am getting mocked?

Tl/dr: My fiancé is getting getting rude, showing no respect, and he seems to have no interest in our eventual marriage. "
"My [29/F] neighbours [~30s, M/F] of 9 months trespassed on my property and stole cherries from my tree. How best to handle this?


I bought my first home ~9 months ago and have lived here alone ever since. It's my first time living alone so I'm still adjusting and learning how to deal with things. I've had no issues so far with my neighbours and all the neighbours I've met have been friendly and welcoming to me. 

I'm a reserved person and also work full time while caring for my mum who lives in the town over so if I'm not asleep, I'm usually not at home and so I haven't fully met all my immediate neighbours yet.

2 nights ago, I came home particularly late (~10pm) and my neighbours (Jill and Steve we'll call them) and next-door-but-one neighbour (Gloria) were outside Jill and Steve's house having a chat. Gloria greeted me and introduced me to Jill and Steve who seemed friendly. It was the first time I've spoken to either of them. Jill mentioned the cherry tree in my garden (it overhangs a public walkway) and asked if they could take some of the cherries from it. I said sure, assuming she meant they'd take the overhanging ones or that they'd give me a knock if they wanted some. 

Well, today I came home and a girl about 10 came up to me and told me that the people next door (pointing to Jill and Steve's house) had been in my garden stealing cherries. I didn't think she meant that they were LITERALLY in my garden, so I thanked her for letting me know and explained I'd okay'd them taking some cherries.

When I got in, I let my dog out and saw my once very fruitful cherry tree was completely stripped of every single cherry. I had intended to use some of them myself so I was pretty annoyed. It's about 12-15ft high and almost every single cherry was gone. It couldn't have been kids due to the height of the tree. 

My fence is 6 - 7 ft tall and surrounds the entire perimeter of my garden and is entirely secure. My garden gate was padlocked. I immediately tried the gate to see if it was secure thinking maybe the lock had failed or had been tampered with but it was so secure and the padlock was fine with no signs of tampering. There is literally no other way anyone could have got into my garden without scaling the fence.

I'm unnerved. Jill has a metal cage/frame on her leg and is on crutches, so I know it was Steve who came in my garden which honestly does weird me out even more, rightly or wrongly. My curtains were open so he would have been able to see right into my living room and I had underwear lying on the sofa waiting to be sorted and put away so I'm pretty unnerved that he may have peered into my window and seen them, not to mention he could have seen what valuables I have or if I have any security system in place (I don't...). They both would have known I wasn't home because we have on street parking and my car is very distinct and is in full 12 o'clock view of their house. Steve's seen me getting into/out of my car before many, many times so he knows exactly which car is mine and will therefore know when I'm in or out. 

I was in this morning until 10am and was in yesterday until 10:45am and was home by 8:20pm at the latest so they had at least a few hours during the day/evening between them that they could have knocked if they wanted cherries but they didn't. Neither of them work so I doubt they couldn't have found the time to knock on my door during those hours. 

How do I handle this? I'm nervous to approach them as I hate confrontation as I'm also on the autistic spectrum and find it hard to think on my feet so if they start throwing out excuses I probably wont be able to think fast enough to counteract them. I don't want to be 'outsmarted' so to speak if we get into some sort of argument over it and have them end up thinking I'm an easy target, but I also absolutely need to make my boundaries clear because I will NOT accept anyone coming into my garden without my express permission. I have social anxiety and depression and knowing someone came into my garden uninvited has really made me feel on edge in my own home and I don't feel safe any more. I've had to close all the curtains in my house to go out today because I couldn't shake the feeling he could climb into my garden again and go peeping through my windows. 

I'm just nervous to approach them because I don't want to start any feuds as I have to live here and I'm not in a financially secure enough position to put my house on the market if things go south with the neighbours. I literally have only spoken to them for a grand total of about 3 minutes so they are literal strangers so I have no idea how they'll respond if I approach them. The fact they thought nothing of climbing my fence makes me think they're not exactly reasonable people though. 

How do I best make my boundaries clear and let them know this is NOT okay, while minimising any potential conflict as much as possible? Do I knock and speak to them or do I wait and hope I bump into them one day and then mention it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

**tl;dr neighbours scaled my fence without permission and stole cherries from my tree while I was out. Am very weirded out. How to respond?**"
"My brother [29M] wants me [20F] to pick him up from an airport 5 hours away. I don’t want to. Am I being unreasonable?


The dates for our family reunion has been set since February. My brother hasn’t even looked at flights until last week despite nagging from my parents and other relatives. The flights have obviously gone up significantly in price, but he was able to find one landing 5 hours away for $200 less than what he would pay just flying into our town. He now wants me to drive him to and from the airport both ways. I’m annoyed because I feel like he’s asking me to bear the burden of his negligence in booking his flights. Am I being unfair? How do I tell him I don’t want to do this without putting a strain on our relationship right before the reunion?

**TL;DR my brother was late booking flights and wants me to pick him up and drop him off at an airport 5 hours away so he can save some money. What do?**"
"My(29M) biological mother is trying to reach out after a major falling out. What do I do?


This is going to be a long post with a ton of background...so here we go.

I was adopted at birth into a loving family, and I was given the best life anyone could ask for. My family always told me about my adoption, gave me my biological family's name, and ultimately left it up to me as to whether or not I wanted to reach out to them. We moved halfway across the country, so reaching out to them wasn't exactly a simple prospect.

I lost my adopted mother unexpectedly when I was 10, and was raised by my dad ever since.

I graduated college in 2012. Life was finally going to change as I entered the adult world, and I decided it best to finally learn about where I came from. Lo and behold, I found out I had a second biological sister that I never knew about, and they both flew out to spend a week with me.

It was probably one of the best, most enlightening weeks of my life. One of my sisters, ""Dana"", has some struggles (addiction), and the other, ""Lily"", was adopted off to another member of our biological family and lived a very privileged life.

During that week, I learned that ""Dana"" is still very tight with my biological mother, ""mum"", despite being shipped from household to household as a child. She insisted that I meet her, and despite my apprehensions, I did. It was cordial enough conversation, we added each other on Facebook, and life went on. All the while, ""Lily"" warned me numerous times that mum is a downright nasty and evil woman.

Fast forward a few months, and ""Dana"" and mum decide to fly up to see my graduation. Mum asked if she could come a few days early to meet with me, which was a little inopportune because I was working part-time, planning a graduation party, and dealing other typical guy things, but I agreed.

Next thing I know, she showed up even earlier than expected. Meeting her in person went well enough, but she was ... odd. Asked if I could call her mom, wanted to go on all these excursions, etc. I had to politely remind her that I had a full plate before my graduation, and taking off just wasn't possible. I also politely told her that while I'd be willing to have a relationship with her, I wasn't willing to call her mom or develop that kind of relationship. Since I lost my adopted mom when I was 10, pursuing that relationship just felt like betrayal. Mum was cool with it, and went off to her hotel.

Graduation day comes, and she and ""Dana"" came out my house a few hours before the ceremony. We agreed to drive separately to the ceremony...and they both never showed up. This honestly didn't bother me in the slightest bit, but my adoptive dad and aunt both got really upset.

This is when things imploded.

Mum and ""Dana"" showed up to the graduation party and gave some goofy excuse as to why they didn't show up, and I just dismissed it. 

All through the graduation party, mum followed me around like a lost puppy. I introduced her to family members and friends, but it was always like she expected more.

My adoptive dad actually pulled her aside and tried to explain how I was feeling, but she kept on all night.

We agreed to meet up the next day to take a ton of photos together, and sure enough, she never showed up. I tried calling her and texting her, but I never got a response.

A few days later, she sent me a long message basically saying meeting me was a waste of time, and a slew of other nastiness. At the time, I had a message typed up (I can't recall the specifics), but I remember deleting it because I knew it would destroy her and bring me down to her level. I didn't want either of those things, and I instead let the silence speak for me.

This was 6 years ago.

Now, this is what happened yesterday.

I just got a FB message / friend request from mum, which I have yet to respond to. She is asking for ""half a chance"" with no sort of apology or acknowledgement of how we got to this point.

At this point, I'm not sure there's any way to come back from what has been said/done, and I don't think I owe her anything. I hate cutting people out, but at this point, I feel even trying to talk to her is going to be fake on my part. I'm not saying I'd lash out at her, but I just have no desire to carry on any sort of relationship with her.

Am I wrong feeling this way? Is there any other perspective that I'm not seeing here?

***TL;DR: I was adopted at birth, met my biological mother a few years ago, had a falling out, now she wants back in***"
"Wife [34F] had secretly convinced my [35M] niece [17F] to run away from home with her 22yr old boyfriend. Niece is back after suffering a lot of abuse and wife finally confessed. I don't know how to handle any of this.


Sorry if this all comes off a little rambly. I will keep some names/places vague to protect their identities.

This all started roughly one year ago. My niece was going through a tough time with her parents but it seemed like basic teenager type stuff. She wanted more freedom and her parents wanted her to keep her grades up. A lot of grounding, and suspension of car/curfew/dating privileges really led to a boiling point early this year. So my wife has always been very close to my niece because we have no kids and we've taken on the cool uncle/aunt role to our niece/nephews. I've always known that my wife will message or text my niece every now and then and they've gone shopping together. All normal.

A few months ago my brother (the dad) calls me in shock and asks me if I saw Emily (my niece) or heard from her at all. Apparently they found a note from her saying that she's left to travel with her boyfriend who they never knew about. (He's like 22 or 23). The note said not to worry about her and that they'll be somewhere in California for a few months. Obviously her parents were worried and called the police. Since she was just over 16 and left a note, the police was not super bothered and promised to ""look into it"" but obviously nothing happened. There wasn't any official search because it was assumed my niece was not in any danger and left voluntarily. My brother and his wife were worried sick and the wife had several mental breakdowns over the course of the 3-4 months.

3 weeks ago Emily finally came home looking sickly thin and like she was almost malnourished. Her parents immediately brought her to the police station and called us. Apparently she was manipulated by her POS boyfriend because he had promised to pay for her living costs but also physically abused her in return. She had a fractured rib for like 2 weeks because the guy wouldn't take her to a hospital. She's only NOW getting medical care. Anyways she was too scared to leave because she had no money and she was too ashamed to call her parents for help.

So last week my wife sat me down all of a sudden and confessed that she had more of a role in Emily's running away than we knew about. She said she wanted me to know now in case more things come up during the investigation and interviews with the police. She said she had been talking to Emily in the weeks leading up to her running away and apparently she may have ""encouraged"" her to run away. I was in shock and I kept asking my wife to see the messages but she said she deleted them all in fear. She said they weren't anything serious because she didn't think Emily was going to be in danger. My wife grew up with very emotionally abusive and overbearing parents herself so she said she had sympathized a ton with Emily's own feelings of anger towards her own parents. My wife said she simply encouraged Emily to seek independence if her parents are causing her so much unhappiness. She thought the guy was a good guy from what Emily said and didn't think she would be in danger.

I honestly don't know what to do and I haven't said anything to my brother, his wife, or the police yet but I know I have to soon. I can't say anything to anyone outside of the anonymous internet and I feel like I'm going crazy. The most damning part is that my wife KNEW about this guy before the note and she could've said something to her parents or said something to the police to lead them there before my niece had to suffer so much. She knew details about the guy that no one else did and I feel so angry knowing that she didn't say anything because she was scared. I don't know what to feel right now. Honestly how do I make of this whole situation? Should I forgive my wife and work through this or should I take time off and stay somewhere else? I feel like I need time away to think , but my wife has been sobbing and begging for me to stay. What do I do?

**Tl:dr:** Wife had a hand in convincing my 17 year old niece to run away with an abusive boyfriend. Niece is finally back home after months of mistreatment and wife confessed to me because she's scared the truth may come up with the police. I feel like I'm losing my mind. What do I do?"
"I finally just ended the 6-year relationship from HELL and now I'm terrified.


I'm [26F], he's [38M], and we have lived together for 6 years, basically the entire time we've known each other.  There's no way I can adequately describe the hell we've both been through together *and* put each other through.  Basically, we're just bad together and to each other.  The people pleaser in me would like to say it was all his fault and he's just terrible, but I'm not sure anyone could willingly spend that much time in that toxic of a situation and still come out the other side thinking they were anything resembling a good person.  So yeah, it's my fault, I'm a bad person, and I don't even know anymore whether I always was or if I became one along the way. 

Fuck it, anyway, fast forward to recent history.  Our normal level of tension has gone through the roof since I lost my job just in time for him to get a very expensive illness two months ago.  We were trying to have a nice, relaxed day today, but the tension was still there.  A new GameStop opened near us recently, so we decided to check it out.  Being GameStop, of course one of the guys that works there immediately came over and started asking what kinds of games we like and trying to pitch us new ones.  I guess since the store is new, this guy was *especially* pushy and chatty, which my ex/boyfriend hates.  He started acting rudely, blatantly ignoring the guy, making sarcastic comments under his breath, and just generally being unecessarily dickish in a situation that was already uncomfortable for everyone.  Normally I totally crumble in these scenarios (awkward stranger interactions), but I felt like I *really* needed to pick up the social slack, so I started talking to the guy about RPGs I like and let him suggest a few more for me to try.  I politely asked a few questions about the games he suggested (The Witcher 3 is literally the best game ever made, in case anyone hasn't heard yet), struggling the whole time because I'm a nervous mess, and trying unsuccessfully a few times to bring my ex/boyfriend back into the conversation.  

Finally we leave, I turn to him to joke about how overeager the guy had been, only to have him tell me to never fucking talk to him again (this is a common start to an argument), storm over to the car, and *lock me the fuck out of it* (this is *not* a common start to an argument).  I had to stand there for 10 minutes, in a packed parking lot, quietly begging him to let me in because I was fucking embarrassed and it was too far to walk home.  Me saying I was embarrassed just pissed him off *more*, so he decided to roll his window all the way down, lay on the horn, and scream, ""LOOK EVERYONE, IT'S A CHEATING FUCKING WHORE!!!  THE CHEATING FUCKING WHORE IS EMBARRASSED THAT SHE'S A WHORE!!!!"". 

Mind you, we were parked *right in front* of the *glass fronted store* that we had *just walked out of*, so it is extremely obvious that I'm *that* idiot girl dealing with *that* jealous guy to everyone still inside.  

He finally let me back in the car on the condition that I not say a fucking word to him on the way home, which *would* have been fine if the shock hadn't worn off and allowed me to feel the bottomless pit of rage that was boiling in my stomach.  So we argued, I called him a psychotic prick, he kept calling me a whore and *helpfully* explaining all the reasons I was obviously lying about flirting with another guy *right in front of him* (I was touching my hair, I was sweating, I laughed too loudly, etc.).  Like he's conveniently forgotten everything he knows about my social anxiety *except* when he's using it to punish me for imagined wrongs in a public place.  Fucking asshole.  By the time I'd talked him down from ""I KNOW THE THE FUCK I SAW"" to ""Well it really *seemed* like you were"", I was too exhausted to fight anymore and just went to fucking bed.  

So now that I've relived my public humiliation for the second time (Hi, public!), I guess I can move on to why we broke up.  No, it *wasn't* that because I'm an idiot and an asshole.  My stupid ass actually ended up *apologizing* for that madness because I ""knew"" he was just lashing out because I'd fucked us by losing my job.  Anyway. 

So I guess he got complacent with me being asleep and left his laptop open where I could see it.  Normally he guards this thing like a starving dog with a bone, and admittedly I have been known to snoop, but I haven't done it in years because I kept finding *borderline* shit that I couldn't prove was more, and it was driving both of us crazy.  Borderline flirtation that might not have been, porn that looked suspiciously homemade, obvious gaps in conversations where things had been deleted, that kind of thing. Lots of smoke, but no fire, so I was constantly overreacting to potentially innocuous shit.  And on any other day, I would have stayed strong and not given in to old bad habits, but the words ""CHEATING WHORE"" kept running through my mind on a loop, so I looked.  Found fire.  Messages from a married woman telling him how she wanted his head between her legs (he does *not* eat pussy, sorry to disappoint), him asking her if she was wet... I didn't get to see a lot before he came in and snatched it away (he was already making that disbelieving, ""you're fucking crazy"" face), but I got the impression that it was an ongoing sexting thing.  A few hours later he would admit that she wasn't the only one. 

 I didn't even react in the moment.  Like I just wasn't surprised in the least, and I was still too tired from earlier to be outraged.  I just told him what I saw, laughed at him for having the balls to get jealous over GameStop Guy, went outside to smoke, and called my mom to beg for help, which she's willing to give.  She wants to drive 3+ hours to where we live to pick me up tomorrow.  Or I guess today... sun's up and I haven't slept.  

------------------------

**Below this line is where I stop with the catharsis and actually ask for advice.**. I apologize for how long this is, but I've been very lonely for a very long time. 

-------------------------

So I've been in this utterly nightmarish relationship for 6 years too long, and I know it needs to end.  If I'm honest, emotionally, I don't *want* it to... I want to keep clinging and stay in denial until things get better, but they're never going to. I know it's for the best.  But I'm a little in shock at the speed at which this is happening.  

Less than 24 hours ago, right or wrong, I was fully committed to a lifetime with him. Can I just *move out* at the drop of a hat like this after so long?  Like, logistically. We have a life together, a lease together, a utility bill together, 2 cats together, a car together, and I don't know what's going to happen with any of it.  Am I going to be on the hook for rent if I just bail?  I can't take the cats to my mom's place, so I just leave them?  What if he drops them off at a shelter and bails right behind me?  I know he wants to.  My mom's place is so far away that I think I only have one shot to do this right... I won't be able to come back and fix anything I forget. 

ALSO, I have absolutely NO relationship with my family.  I called my mom in a moment of desperation, 100% convinced that she would hang up on me, and I would have deserved it.  I pissed on the ashes of that bridge years ago, back when this relationship had barely started, and I am absolutely terrified of the consequences there if I actually accept her help.  I was *awful* to my family and left them holding the bag of all my many, many collosal fuckups.  She's *still* paying for my suicide bill *and* a car that I let get stolen.   

I just... Need help traversing this.  I've spent the majority of my adult life with this man, and I feel completely clueless about how to go about ending it.  If anyone has advice or insight into things I might not have thought about, it would be appreciated.  I feel really fucking lost right now. 

**TL;DR** I'm ending a serious relationship with bills and shit, and I don't know how.  I don't know how to get my shit together and be an adult."
"My [23F] BF [24M] of 5 years left me at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere


Sorry for bad formatting: mobile. Rushed story because I have to get this up before BF returns home 

Well, the title is as crazy as it seems. Yes, I’m still in shock. So let’s give a run down of the events that occurred this past wednesday. I want to preface this by saying my boyfriend HATES road trips and more importantly, hates road trips that involve seeing his parents. 

Recently, one of his cousins had gotten engaged and we were invited to their engagement party. Considering they live about a four hour drive away, I convinced my boyfriend it would be worth the drive to celebrate with his distance family, considering he probably wouldn’t have to do much talking to his more immediate family. It ended up taking quite a bit of convincing to go, but ultimately he decided that it would be a fun trip, and it was only for a few days, so why not. He insisted on driving the whole way, which I told him NUMEROUS time I would either drive, or at least split it, but he insisted on him driving, so I agreed. 

The morning we were leaving was just a shit show from the moment it started. As soon as we woke up, my boyfriend was in probably the worst mood I had ever seen him in. He was angrily slamming doors, giving me snarky comments and mumbling under his breath. I also want to say that while I did convince him to go on this trip, I made sure he knew it was his decision and I wouldn’t be angry if he decided he didn’t want to do it. His comments that morning had made it seem like I had forced him into everything and that I always got my way. 

When we made it through the morning, we finally hit the road and that’s when he’ll broke loose. My boyfriend was driving like a maniac, cutting people off and yelling at other drivers through his open window. He was going 15 over the speed limit and ultimately making me extremely carsick and worried. Finally, when we reached a lesser populated road, about two and a half hours into the drive, I asked if we could stop at a rest stop. 1. to give my boyfriend some time to cool down and 2. because I really needed to pee. 

I didn’t think this would be a problem, but for some reason, this request set him off and he began to yell at me for being irresponsible, how he was the one driving and how I made him go on this trip so I shouldn’t be making requests, etc. Really, this isn’t the point of the story. He eventually did stop at a rest stop with a lot of pleading on my end. I was relieved to finally get out of the car. 

After using the bathroom, I exited the building and looked around for my boyfriend’s car which was originally parked in the middle of the parking lot. It’s a bright red car, very hard to miss, so when so didn’t see it at first, my immediate thought was that he was just driving around while he waited for me to be done. Except, five minutes of waiting very quickly turned into twenty, which at that point I had realized he had completely left me there. I was forced to call my sister, who luckily lived just under an hour away, to pick me up and drive me home. 

When I got home, my phone had been dead as my sister drove, so I learned my boyfriend had driven to his family after all, and had also left me 16 missed calls and 3 voicemails, along with 7 texts (some very long paragraphs) saying how apologetic and sorry he was and how he’s a terrible boyfriend. He has been gone since Wednesday, but I haven’t answered any of his texts or calls. He seems genuinely extremely apologetic which ultimately confuses me the most. 

If he was so apologetic, why did he do it in he first place? I don’t know what I’m going to do when he gets home, I can’t even begin to imagine what I could say to him when we talk it out because my biggest fear is that another outburst like this will happen. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend of 5 years and I got into an argument on a road trip, I asked him to stop at a rest stop to use the bathroom, and when he finally stopped he left me stranded and my sister had to pick me up. Now he’s been calling me and is extremely remorseful about everything. "
"I [32F] love him [33M] but I don’t feel like we’re married anymore.


We’ve been together 8 years, we never said a bad word to each other, no yelling, had a great sex life and we have two amazing kids. But I feel dragged down by him, ever since the first kid It felt like he got out of work because it was easy for him to do. He said he would be stay at home daddy which I agreed too as long as he helps at home.  
  
However home never gets cleaned at all, I usually get home from work and do the chores after I ask him if baby 1 was okay and he said he had to hold him all day because he was clingy but there hubby is, playing a game. Any help as ask for is met with a puff or you’re lazy as well so you do it. 
 
After baby two again I’m working he’s at home should I mention here he has no license as well so he heavily relies on me for everything. Anyway anything I ask him to do he rolls his eyes and does it begrudgingly, I work less hours but I still have to do everything else’s home and I have the baby too and he had time to help. No he rather sit on discord and hack consoles.
 
We don’t have sex, I’m not attracted to him anymore, basically he’s a baby sitter. The straw that broke me was one night I had to do shift work and needed sleep and we agreed he do the night shift, he woke me up and told me to do it. 
 
I cry in the car to work, my relationship is with a lazy man. If I leave him bills will be too expensive for us to manage seperatly and we already live in a cheap area so my costs cannot go any higher so I’m in the same house. 
  
English is not my first language sorry for mistakes. 

[b]Tl;dr : husband turned into a fat lazy man, I’m depressed and cry a lot what do I do[/b]"
"My [m29] girlfriend [f40] of several years had a paranoid psychotic breakdown and attacked me and destroyed our apartment. None of her family wants anything to do with her; what do I do with all her things? How do I process this?


My girlfriend spiraled last week and it culminated in her paranoia reaching such a point that she attacked me and tried to burn the apartment down. I managed to get a 911 call in before she destroyed our phones and she was taken into protective custody.

They say she'll most likely be held there long-term for inpatient care, but her family is entirely out of state and are not interested enough to help her at all, and I'm beginning to realize she's burnt their bridges already and that might be why she's so far from home and isn't close to them anymore.

She never had a job and I supported her completely. She destroyed the apartment on her spiral down and now I am on disability and can't afford to stay; I'm moving to a smaller place, but I have all her possessions and nobody will help me with advice on how to deal with all of this. I have a therapist but she isn't really sure about things like this. I do know that I am not going to be involved with her anymore and I want to move on. 

I was thinking about getting the cheapest storage facility and putting her things in there, and leaving a key at the facility she's at. I already delivered a few bags of clothes to her.

She has my number and calls, but she spent the first two calls trying to place half of the blame on me and claiming that I'm just as mentally unwell and her actions were rational.
We have since established that her calls are going straight to the voicemail and I'll address them as needed, for now.


I'm really sad. I also feel like I am doing the right thing, but every time I talk to her I feel obligated to be involved and help her as much as possible, but I don't want to. She is very good at manipulating people, and me in particular.

I really could use some help processing all of this. It just happened last week / weekend. I'm staying at my parents house out of town so I'm safe.

** tl;dr: My girlfriend attacked me and is in custody and nobody but me wants to help, and I'm the last person who should. What's the right thing to do? **

Thanks all. "
"My brother and his friends (20) got me (16M) to put together furniture and a set for them and now they won't pay me because I'm a minor.


Background info. I'm still in high school, but my school has got this really cool program where I can learn carpentry at a university as subject, and I get a cert 3 by the end of it. My brother is in University. 

My brother came to me and asked if I could put together some furniture and this set type area for them. It came ready to be assembled. He buttered me up saying how good I am with my hands and tools. He even said it would be good practice. So we agreed on $15 dollars an hour. It took me 25 hours to put together everything. 20 desks, 20 chairs, 8 cabinets and this set piece backdrop. He owes me almost $400. 

He's saying he can't pay me because I'm a minor and it could get him in trouble. He also said he and his friends don't have that much money to spare. I don't know if I am a minor or if that's bullshit. I'm not sure on work laws. That's his excuse and he's sticking to it. 

**TL;DR: My brother won't pay me the agrees amount for my work.**"
"My boyfriend [29M] is interested in having a foursome. I [25F] think it might be time to end the relationship.


Background: My boyfriend and I are coming up on our second anniversary. For the last month and a half I've been begging him to take the day off of work to celebrate (it's my regularly scheduled day off). His answer has been a firm no - he says work is understaffed and we need the money. We're not rolling in dough, but we have an emergency fund saved and regularly put away $750/month. We're not strapped for cash.

Foursome: My boyfriend has wanted this experience through our entire relationship. I don't have a moral objection to the idea by any means, but I believe that a couple that participates in swinging has to have an extraordinary amount of stability and communication between them. Last summer we planned a date with a couple and the week prior to the plan I pulled us out of it. I didn't feel secure enough in our relationship and I didn't think our relationship would withstand the potential negatives of that kind of experience. 

This summer we were giving it another try. Although we've been an candidate for r/deadbedrooms for the last year, I agreed to meet a couple who we've been regularly communicating online. I'm really comfortable with them. The whole experience thus far has been very friendly and fun. A few days ago they suggested we meet up at a local club that is frequented by my co-workers. 

I work a funny schedule because of school, so it takes a good deal of notice and begging to arrange for a coworker to take one of my weekend shifts. I told my boyfriend I would try to swing it. Ultimately, none of the few co-workers wanted to take the shift. I suggested we schedule to meet the couple at a later date. 

In result, my boyfriend threw a man-sized tantrum. He felt like I was stalling (as I did last time) and he'd continue giving up important sexual experiences because of my unwillingness to ""follow through"". He told me I should call off of work (as he wouldn't do for our anniversary) despite the likelihood that I would run into one of my co-workers at the place we were meeting the couple. 

After a long conversation my boyfriend and I came to the understanding that we want different things in the bedroom (this is the reason our sex life has become non-existent). He wants something more primal without emotion while I require emotion. This lead to a conversation about intentions about engagement and marriage - I was told that he wants the ""full package"" - a girl who is beautiful, smart, funny, and of course, a great sex life. The sex life was making everything incomplete. 

The kicker is this - I was told that he is who he is. He's never going to act the way I want him to in the bedroom. Essentially, he's laid everything at my feet. I'm thinking it's time we take a break, split our finances, and move into different places. I don't see this being easily resolved. Am I being irrational? 

Tl;dr Boyfriend wants a foursome and is open to ""playing alone"". Neither of our sexual needs are being met. I'm emotionally spent. I think it might be time to end the relationship. "
"[UPDATE] My boyfriend [27 M] is very uncomfortably close to his ex-wife [27 F] and I'm [24 F] not sure what do or how to feel


  Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8vk3wc/my\_boyfriend\_27\_m\_is\_very\_uncomfortably\_close\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8vk3wc/my_boyfriend_27_m_is_very_uncomfortably_close_to/)

I would like to thank everybody for the responses to my previous post. Honestly I should have just trusted my gut. Literally 3 days after making the post my boyfriend suddenly broke up with me saying he wasn’t 100&amp;#37; in the relationship and I deserved a guy who was totally in love with me. Obviously I demanded to know if there was someone else since it was so sudden and didn’t make any sense. He denied it. Honestly I was heartbroken and cried for days. I kept texting him and calling him asking for a real explanation and he didn’t respond and just said I should move on. 

I then decided 2 days later to go get my stuff that was in his house. I still had a key so I didn’t warn him and just went to get it. (I know this was stupid but I was angry and wasn’t thinking straight) Low and behold who was in his house when I got there, eating breakfast at a table in her pajamas…his ex-wife I’m not proud to admit that I had a mini freak out and probably came across as a crazy woman, especially to his daughter. However, I did calm myself down, returned his key, grabbed my stuff (that he had already put aside) and left. 

He called me to demand why I just came into his house without warning and yelled at his ex. I accused him of cheating. He insisted he never cheated and that when I came to his house his ex-wife had just spent the night to “visit” but he did say that he realized that he still had feeling for her and they wanted to see if there was anything there especially for their daughter. He then apologized and said he just wanted to break it up with me before it got any further and before anybody go too hurt.  I’m not sure if I 100&amp;#37; believe that he didn’t cheat but it is what it is. I blocked his number and I guess I’m moving on. I’m obviously heartbroken but I don’t know what else to do. This is a warning to other people that if something truly doesn’t feel right, you ARE NOT being too sensitive. I’m not saying all people who have good relationships with their exes are suspicious but I should have trusted my gut. 

**Tl:dr- My boyfriend broke up with me. Pretty sure he’s trying to rekindle things with his ex-wife. Feel crappy** "
"Fiance (28m) and I (27f) went out with friends (20s/30s) last night. We had a very flirty night where he was constantly checking out my boobs. Friend (31f) will not leave me alone because she thinks I'm a victim. Is it time to drop her as a friend or was I wrong and should apologize?


So where to begin. 

We had sort of a spontaneous night out last night that kind of came together at the last minute. My fiancé was the one who put it together for us when in reality I had just wanted to stay home and nexflix and chill...with a severe emphasis on the chill. He seemed excited to go out so I was like ok fine, but you're going to ""pay"" for it and I decided to tease him all night long by wearing a pretty ridiculous club top that as he put it ""put your boobs on a platter"" along with a short skirt. 

My plan worked and he could not stop staring and I could not stop teasing him by grazing my boobs on his arm, hugging him and that sort of thing pretty much all night long. He obviously noticed so then he started making a huge point of staring down my top and just basically flirting along with me. We were having a really fun time and completely kept it between the two of us and I was 100% the instigator if that makes sense. 

Out with us last night was a girl from our social circle who I'll call ""Deb."" I've always gotten along with her but among our like 8-10 friends she's always the one I'm ready to get away from after a night out. She's the one who when you go out to eat will tell you all the reasons as to why you should order tofu instead of chicken and then spend 10 minutes talking about the virtues of getting her salad dressing on the side. I actually think she does mean well and cares about everyone but her manner of delivery really leaves a lot to be desired. She's also super political and will argue with anyone about nearly anything...in fact it almost seems like she gets her talking points off of r/all nearly every day I see her. 


So Deb saw what my fiancé was doing but apparently she did not see that I was having fun with it. She surreptitiously  texted me ""are you ok?"" I looked at her across the table and said ""I'm totally fine Deb, are you ok?"" she then texted me back ""it's ok to say you aren't ok. Let me know."" I was looking at her and my phone thinking like what in the fuck is she talking about, does she think I drank to much? Did she see someone slip something in my drink? So I scooted out of the booth and told her to come talk to me. We were in a hallway of the club and asked her what was going on...she said ""I've just been watching you two all night and I want you to know that he has no right to leer at you and touch you regardless of what you are wearing."" At first I honestly thought she was joking so I sort of laughed and said ""oh yeah, we got a me too moment happening right in front of our eyes."" That really made her mad and she stormed off and I chased after her for like a minute but was thought better of it. 
She told another friend she was leaving and then I felt sort of bad so I texted her that I wish she'd come back and that my joke was very inappropriate. 


She started with an absolute barrage of texts with links about victims and victimhood. I was stunned. Finally I texted her back and told her to please mind her own business I dressed like I did specifically to get attention from my fiancé. The text conversation then devolved into her making an accusation about him, me defending him and then her telling me that my defense of him was further evidence that I was a victim. 

I have to emphasize that I'm in no way a victim of my fiancé. We have an amazing relationship that is very mutually supportive and loving and I wouldn't be marrying him if it were anything other than that. 

Finally I'd had enough and told her I couldn't talk about this any more and stopped responding, after that she sent me probably 10 more texts offering support, a place to stay and other ""resources."" I was pretty much exhausted by the whole night so we left early and I tried to put the moves on my fiancé on the way home but after the fight (I guess you'd put it) with Deb, I was so out of the mood that I was forcing it and my fiancé could clearly see that so he told me it was ok, he knew I'd had a rough night and we didn't have to do anything. 

So we went home and went to bed and he was the perfect gentlemen he always is and nothing happened despite me teasing him all night long. So contrary to Deb's insistence of me being a victim, he was able to respect my massive swing from 
""super, uber, put a baby in me now"" horny to ""I just want to go to sleep and put this night behind us"" cold fish. 


I haven't texted Deb back because I honestly don't know what to say. I feel bad for my joke when I appeared to not be taking her concerns seriously so part of me thinks I set things in motion when I could have been more receptive and talked her down from her high horse a bit. 


But then another part of me thinks that she way overstepped her boundaries. We were in a club, we weren't at a family restaurant, I'm allowed to have my own way of interacting and boundaries with my fiancé and no one else either seemed to notice or was bothered by it so it's all on Deb. A real part of me is sick of being lectured every time we go out to get away from our problems and now is a great time to make a break from her. 


What should I do here?


**tl;dr: my friend Deb made a huge issue of my husband flirting with me and checking me out in my fairly skimpy outfit. She thinks it wasn't mutual and I was essentially a victim. She is always making a huge deal out of things like this and I wonder if I should apologize for my part in this  or if now is a good time to make a clean break?**

"I [24F] am in an arranged marriage, and want to get closer to my husband [26M]


My marriage was arranged not for religious reasons, but financial. My family is quite wealthy and so is his. If I didn't, I risked losing everything and my family. It's so, so hard talking about this issue because arranged marriages are unheard of in white American families. 

I somehow got lucky and was married to a relatively kind man. He is good looking. He's never tried to make me do anything I wouldn't want to do. He's never raised a hand at me. There was a brief period of time where I was dealing with a sudden and unknown illness and even though everyone (even my parents) told me to just give it another week and walk it off, he was the only one who encouraged to go to the hospital.

But? He doesn't talk to me beyond what he deems necessary. He'll ask me if I need anything from the store or we'll discuss what bills need to be paid. Sometimes he'll sit at the opposite end of the couch and work on his laptop while I watch TV, but, again, he doesn't make conversation.

It's been a year and a half and we haven't had sex. I've never had sex, but I want to badly. I consider myself relatively attractive (above average if I really put in effort), and I'll sometimes walk around the house in something revealing, sometimes just a plain t-shirt and my panties, but he'll usually turn his head or if he has to talk to me, he'll just look me in the eye.

I do think there is something going on with him, personally. I only ever see him eat dinner, and even that he will only eat a third of what's on his plate. I don't know how often he sleeps, but he always seems to have bags under his eyes and his eyes are bloodshot. I've heard him crying, once. When I ask him if he's okay he insists that he was fine.

I know this situation isn't ideal for him, but I hate feeling like I'm in this alone. He doesn't have to act like my husband if he doesn't want to, but I just wish we could at least be friends.

tl;dr: I'm in an arranged marriage and I want to be close with my husband, but he doesn't seem to want to be close to me."
"My (late 20s/F) brother (mid 20s) and i have been estranged for years. I am a bone marrow match but do not want to donate as he is still being disrespectful and doing so will require me to give up my whole life and move back to my home country after I moved here to escape his bullying.


(I am trying to be a vague on details for privacy reasons, just in case)

I am estranged from brother and have been for several years. I will try and keep it short, but we got along decently growing up (not especially close but not hostile either) until he met his spouse. She is an extremely controlling woman who took an instant dislike to me and would be extremely disrespectful to me in many ways - my brother never stopped her, and if I ever stood up for myself, she would snap at me that she is ""family now"" and I needed to accept her. She and my brother expected my respect and would never return it. He even stole $1000 from me when I was a student struggling and my parents wouldn't do anything about it and I wanted to go to the police but my parents wouldn't hear of it. Their treatment ruined my self esteem, caused my to become depressed because my family was miserable and caused depression and severe body image issues (my brother's wife's favorite hobby was pointing out my non-flat stomach, something I am very insecure about). The two of them used to even have a game to see who could make me cry first at family events. 

After an argument over something small that I don't remember, they told me I would have nothing to do with my nibling (that I actually loved) and told my parents it was their grandchild or me. My parents told me I didn't have to and they will not be bullied but they really loved the grandchild (and the second one I haven't met), but I made the decision to move abroad for my masters a few months later to sort of....make the decision for them, and because it was better for my mental health to be away from these toxic people. I was lucky enough to get a good job in my new country. My parents visit in odd numbered years and I visit in even numbered years, so I see them once every 12 months. While I enjoy living here, I do resent very much what went down.

I made two attempts to reconcile with him over email - a few months after the initial argument and then about a year later, and both of them ended with him and his wife using separate accounts to ""double up"" on me, pin the blame on me, and tell me it it is my fault my parents don't see the grandchild and telling me to live with knowing I ruined my parents lives, and told me to never speak to them ever again and that the world would be a better place if I ""just died already"". 

4 years later when visited, I find out my brother is in need of bone marrow and my mother begs me to get tested as her and my father are not matches. I don't want to do it but I agree and pray I am not a match. My brother and his wife start blowing up my phone with messages saying I better fucking do it and not to be a selfish \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as always. What is bothering me is that they have actually made no attempt to reconcile with me or speak to me civilly, all they have done is sent me messages worded emails saying that I ""need"" to get tested with the expectation I will do it without hesitation if I am a match. When I replied to one asked if I could actually meet with with the nibling I haven't seen in 4 years (just to test the response, really) if I were to do this and to possibly speak with them to iron things out, I was told to stay on topic, stop asking for stuff because ""we still don't like you we just need you"" so to just do what is necessary and then go back into ""your hole"". 

I am a match.

After all this, I don't want to do it. 

And while this sounds petty, I am really angry that after everything he said to me, the way he didn't care about how much he and his wife hurt me, and how he told me to never speak to him again, he has the nerve to demand I do this for him. You told me to never speak to you again - wish granted as far as I am concerned. And on a selfish level, I have a very good job I was lucky to get and my life is in this new country now. If I do this, I donate ""when it is best for the health of the recipient"" which could be several months from now or could be three weeks. It would mean I have to move back here. I am just a 18 months away for qualifying for permanent residence in this country and I need to keep my job for that. If I quit my job to stay here, there is no guarantee I would get another job (especially as there are now new laws that they must give preference to citizen and permanent residents now and can only hire people outside those categories if there is no suitable citizen/PR), I would set back my qualification process, and might end up ""stuck"" here when my whole life is back abroad - a life I created after he basically told me to get out of the family. The want me to give that up, sit around here, put myself through pain for him, save his life, and then go back to being persona non grata. I don't want that. I have gotten some legal advice and 3 immigration lawyers with no connection to each other have all advised me that I jepordise my chances of getting to stay here if I were to move home for about a year (I didn't explain exactly why, just said family emergency) and that that putting a huge break in my continuous working history is basically the worst act of self sabotage I can do with the new laws. 

I don't know how to handle this because they are the kind of people who will tell EVERYONE and go public and try to completely destroy my life, and all without telling the full story of our estrangement, and everyone will tell me to be the bigger person and I am sick of being the bigger person. I spend over $3000 in therapy bills learning to deal with his treatment of me and our estrangement and basically got myself to a place where I just.....have no brother. I sound heartless but I just.....don't really care what happens to someone who blackmailed me, stole from me, and told me I should just die. 

I want to explain to the doctors everything and that I was pressured into being tested and as them to tell him and my parents I am not a match and just go back to my life before I end up back in a dark place mentally from dealing with my family, but I am scared they will not do this and if they don't, I don't know what to do or how to handle it. 

tl,dr: Been estranged from brother who told me to never speak to him again and bullied me for years, he is now in need of bone marrow but I don't want to donate because I moved abroad to escape him and my awful family life and am finally happy and donating will require me to give that life up and risk not getting to return. Brother is being rude and threatening and has basically said my job is to just give him the marrow and ""go back into my hole"" and basically just wants me to do this and doesn't care to apologize or repair relationship.

"My (30M) contractor's (32F) father died the morning of a job


Hi Reddit, thanks for reading this. I already struggle with social anxiety in a normal situation so I have no idea how to handle this.

I have a contractor, Sheila, who has done various odd jobs for me around my house. We have a friendly, professional relationship. We get along and make small talk for a little while whenever she comes around, but there is nothing romantic between us. She has done maybe 5 handyman type jobs around my house in the last year.

I had an appointment with Sheila a few days ago to do a minor job on my house. She is usually punctual, so 15 minutes after the agreed time when she didn't show up, I sent a brief text asking if she was coming. Within minutes, she came back with a professional, friendly response stating that her father had died that morning and that another contractor will be able to help me (at most, his death would have happened a few hours before the appointment). Obviously I am very apologetic, offer my sympathies, and tell her not to worry about anything.

At that point I felt terrible that she even had to respond to a client within hours of her dad dying, and I am blown away that she bothered to. When I talked to her contracting company they informed me that she had notified them of her father's passing and they had failed to inform me that she would not be showing up.

I feel very sorry that she is going thru this. Here is my question: as a semi-regular client, is it over-the-top to give the contracting company a condolence card to give to her when she returns to work? Or should I leave it as it is and not bring it up again?

TLDR; My contractor's father passed the morning of a job and she apologized that morning for not being available. Should I give her a condolence card or just not bring it up?"
"27 [M] with my fiancee [28/F] of three years. Found unflattering messages about me and I don't know what to think


I have always had a big crush on my fiancee. She was my sister's friend in HS (a grade ahead of me) and we both attended the same university. She and I were never close but definitely knew each other - she and my sister spent a lot of time together. 

We started dating 3 years ago, she had come out of a tough relationship with a guy that everyone universally loathed. She stayed single for a while and through a bunch of random meet-ups and hanging out with my sister, we ended up getting together. I was thrilled from the start, we've had a really easy going courtship. She started hinting that she started to hint that she wanted an engagement and 6 months ago, I asked and she said yes. 

Yesterday she has been changed her email over and asked me to go through old emails and forward anything I thought was important to her new account. She asked me because it's an incredibly boring task. So, I was going through and found emails from around the time we started dating and continuing to about ~4 months into our relationship that are between her and a friend that was living in NYC at the time. It goes into pretty solid detail about our relationship and comparing me &amp; her ex. 

The emails.... aren't flattering. At first she questions why we're together, then questions what we're doing together, compares me negatively to her ex and isn't sure about what she is doing in a relationship. The emails are pretty frequent for the four months when the subject abruptly changes to other things and she and her friend don't discuss it. 

At the time, we talked about our feelings and she never voiced anything. Over the last three years, we've become close, she's told me that I'm her best friend, we've planned for the future. The emails really spooked me. They were also hurtful. I know they're in the past, but I just feel really crummy. I didn't mention them to her, I'm sure she forgot about them. 

Should I drop it? Why do I feel so crappy?

--- 

tl;dr found emails about me that were really unflattering, feel really low after reading them. Not sure what I should do after finding them, if I should just drop them, or if I should just leave it alone. Feel really low. "
"I (32/M) need a polite way to back out of my friend’s (28/F) wedding in a month without making it obvious that I have feelings for her.


We met through a dating app about three years ago. At the time we were obviously both single, met for a drink and got along really well, and slowly decided to remain friends. I didn’t have feelings for her back then or I’d have at least tried to go on one more date with her. The most we’ve done is kiss. I would think that her fiancé wouldn’t have agreed to invite me to their wedding had she and I actually had sex or done more than kiss. 

Either way that’s not important. 

She and her fiancé have been friends since the first year of high school, so when he eventually confessed to having feelings for her, their relationship was sped up, and they were engaged within a year. Now they’re getting married and I’m genuinely happy for both of them. But I’ve realized within the past year of them being engaged, that maybe I do have feelings for her. 

At no point have I considered telling her. She’s with a guy who makes her really happy. No good could come from me all of a sudden telling her how I feel when I already had my chance years ago. It’s not that she’s with another guy now. That’s not why I suddenly fell hard. I honestly don’t know what it is. Maybe the time we’ve been spending together (hiking, camping, etc.) and the fact that she’s so funny and easy to talk to. 

That’s not her problem either way. 

I’ve tried not to hang out with her as much, just so I’ve got a shot at getting over her before the wedding, but it’s hard now that our friends groups are mixed in. I’m not sure what to do, and part of me thinks maybe it’s not a big deal and I should just go to the wedding and be there for them on their day. Believe me, I want to be there for them, but the idea of watching her marry someone else ... it’s like a kick in the gut. 

The closer we get to the wedding, the harder it is. 

I already said I was going to be there when they sent out the invites months ago. If I don’t show up now, it could create some problems, or at the very least some questions that I’m not sure she wants to know the answers to. 

It’s in a month. I’m not sure what I can say, or what I can do to make it less awkward and uncomfortable for me if I decide to go. 

Suggestions? 

**tl;dr** The wedding is in a month. I had my chance to date her three years ago, and I fucked it up. I didn’t have feelings for her then, but after getting to know her more, I have those feelings now. What can I say to back out of the wedding, or what can I do to make it less awkward or uncomfortable for me if I decide to go? "
"I [31F] left my boyfriend [31M] suddenly after he cheated with coworker [25F] and am having trouble figuring out what he thinks happened.


I live with BF of 3 years and saw on his phone (yes I snooped after feeling suspicious) and he has been cheating on me with his coworker for at least a month (previous texts were deleted). We have had a pretty rocky past together but have worked through everything. We were a few weeks away from moving to a new place and have signed the lease, so I had already started packing for the new place. Well, I packed the rest of my things instead and left while he was at work and met him after he was done and told him that I was having too many doubts and that I packed my things and moved out. It was a very VERY quick breakup and I didn’t say anything about the cheating. He looked shocked and I gave a moment for him to respond but he didn’t really say anything to me. I told him that I had to go and left. 

It has been a week since this happened and I haven’t heard a word from him. I figured that he would have at least contacted me to ask why. I know that I ended things and that he doesn’t owe me anything but after 3 years together, and the fact that I moved out in one day while we were getting ready to move to a new place, I would have expected to at least hear from him. Especially since he doesn’t know that I saw his cheating texts. Now I’m a nervous wreck thinking about what he thinks happened and wondering why he hasn’t asked for an explanation or even contacted me at all about it. We signed our lease together while the cheating was happening, so I know he still wanted our relationship to continue. So why hasn’t he contacted me or asked me why I left? 

**tldr: I left live-in boyfriend suddenly after I saw texts that he cheated. He doesn’t know I know and hasn’t asked me for any explainations about the breakup. Why?**"
"My BF is obsessed with me


Okay, hear me out. I know most people would think this is a ""great problem to have."" But I assure you, I think it's ruining our relationship. We have been dating for about a year, and it's great. We are so perfect for each other, we get along great, same interests, goals, etc. You get the picture. But my SO IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. We spend A LOT of time together, which I love ! He is my best friend and we have a great time together. But he needs constant attention. I can't even be in the same room as him and watch a show or a movie by myself (on my phone). Literally, everything is ""pay attention to me"" or ""cuddle me"" or ""I want to spend time with you."" I have repeatedly told him that he smothers me and that I love him but I don't want to constantly be making out or cuddling literally all of the time. I can't even eat dinner with him without being kissed 5 times. I will literally have food in my mouth and all I get is ""kiss me!"" LIKE, CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT I AM TRYING TO EAT?? It's sweet and it's nice that he loves me so much but I am getting to the point where my patience for it is very, very thin. I want so badly to be with him but I can't take the constant need for attention. When we watch movies together, he lays on my lap and then turns to kiss me 500 times. PLEASE BE STILL AND WATCH THE F'ING MOVIE. I love him and everything about him except for this small thing. I feel like I have to put in so much energy into giving him enough attention that I don't have anything left for other people I love. :( 

TL;DR My bf is constantly in need of attention and I can't take it anymore. "
"I (24f) have officially had it with my overly jealous younger sister (22f). She tried to tell my boyfriend (21m) that I'm cheating on him.


My younger sister, Chloe, has always kind of struggled with her personal relationships. She's only been in 2, but both were bad in many ways.

The most recent one was with a married guy, who said he's leave his wife soon but then basically broke up with her, came back, and still says he will divorce his wife, but they barely have any contact rn, and it's majorly messing with her mood.

I've been in a LDR for 9 months, and I love this guy and we plan on getting married. Despite being long distance, we find ways to spend time together. Watching movies and talking on the phone, playing games together etc.

Me and Chloe live together in an apartment, and the last few days her ""boyfriend"" was acting weird and she was stressing out. I tried helping, but she never listens when she's told to leave him because he's married.

I woke up this morning to a million messages from my boyfriend saying someone told him I've been cheating in him, and I go out with other guys all the time.

I called him, and he finally told me it was Chloe but she told him *not* to say it was her who said it, because she didn't wanna ""ruin our relationship"".

I am absolutely furious. She is so jealous of my relationship that now she's trying to ruin it. Neither of us have the money to move out but I don't think I can be around her anymore.

I feel that she's self destructing, and when her relationship isn't going perfectly, she gets mad at mine and wants to ruin it. What do I do?

Tl;dr; in a LDR and my sister told my bf that I'm cheating on him. She's jealous of my relationship bc she's with a married guy who probably won't ever leave his wife. Don't know what to do."
"My impoverished grandma (80) keeps trying to give me (23) money that she doesn't have, and I want to turn her down without hurting her feelings.


Alright, I’ll try to make this as short as possible. My grandparents are in a pretty poor financial state, and my grandmother keeps trying to give me money that she doesn’t really have. Stage 4 lung cancer has robbed my grandfather of his health, and he can barely string a sentence together due to Alzheimer’s. They were never rich, and a few years ago, telephone scammers got the several thousands of dollars that my grandparents were planning to pass down to their kids. My uncle, who is a very wealthy cheapskate (and a monster), also secretly forced my dementia-ridden grandfather sign over a zero-interest loan to him, which he pays back in small chunks every month. Note: Both of my grandparents will be dead long before they see even ¼ paid back.

My grandmother is extremely hard-headed and refuses to ask anyone for help. Their pantries are pretty bare, so my father, who is very well-off, routinely stocks their house with nutritious, pre-made meals. Lately, I have been watching over my grandpa for 4 or 5 hours on Monday mornings so my grandma can run errands. I’m very happy to help out any way I can, but the past two weeks, she’s very stubbornly insisted on giving me a hundred-dollar bill when I leave. I wouldn’t want her money even if she could afford it; it makes me extremely uncomfortable.  She is stubborn as all hell and refuses to let me leave until I take it (humorously, she was so insistent last time that she jammed it down my shirt).

I would simply bolt as soon as the purse comes out, but that seems pretty rude, and I always like to hug them both goodbye. She is a typical grandparent, and I understand that she wants to spoil her grandchildren, even if we’re grown. No grandparent wants to feel like they can’t provide for and/or spoil their grandkids (she always says “Please, you’re about to transfer schools. Take it for college money; you’re going to need all the help you can get”). I only half-jokingly told her that I would hide the money behind a picture next time I came over. I don’t really know what to do.

TLDR: My impoverished grandma keeps trying to give me money, and I can’t figure out how to turn it down without hurting her feelings."
"The girl (21F) who broke up a past relationship messaged my (22F) current boyfriend (26M) - he sees her as harmless, I see her as toxic, who is right?


Throwaway as my boyfriend knows my main account - all names used here will be fake.

I’ve been dating Chris for coming up to two years. We met at my university, and have been long distance for the past year due to Chris working in his home city. Aside from the generic issues one has with only being able to see one another every other month, our relationship has been solid.

Our issue in question stems from one person - Chloe. Chloe is someone who I went to school with, and who I thought was my friend. During my final years of school I was dating a guy, Rob. Rob and I ended up at the same university (more by luck than judgment, there was definitely no ‘following’ element), however after the first month or so Rob said that he was no longer in love with me and didn’t want to lead me on. I was heartbroken, and thought that he had been sucked up into the vacuum of university life not necessarily connecting with being in a high school relationship. It came out shortly after that Chloe had been encouraging Rob to end the relationship basically as soon as it started. We were all friends during school, however not once did she ever say she was into Rob. The straw that broke the camel’s back was when Chloe, now living 200 miles away at her own university, told Rob that I had told her that I wanted to be single while doing my degree, and would be cheating on Rob the whole time I was there; I never said anything like that. It hurt that she lied, it hurt that Rob never told me what she said and how it was the crux to our relationship ending, and it hurt that I lost a partner and a friend.

Chloe never had the guts to tell me any of this - I heard it through mutual friends, who had screenshots of messages Chloe had sent them after it came out that Rob and I had split up saying that I was never good enough for him and this was her chance. It soon became clear that Rob was never interested in Chloe and started dating a girl he is now engaged to - this was something that Chloe blamed me for. Through more messages to friends, she said that I had clearly poisoned his mind and I was an abusive friend and girlfriend for not ‘helping’ her get Rob. I don’t know whether I was supposed to tell Rob to go after Chloe, but it was clear that she had delusional ideas. I told them that I was done with Chloe and that chapter of my life.

3 years on, and I thought my life would be past these childish events. At the start of my relationship with Chris I had told him all about how Chloe had manipulated my ex boyfriend into leaving me, and how she blamed me for the fact that he never showed any interest in her. I’ll clarify here that Chloe has not spoken to me at all during this 3 year period - our last messages were me wishing her a happy birthday the day before I was told all about her scheming. Chris told me yesterday that Chloe had messaged him through social media to ‘introduce’ herself. I have seen the messages - she acts like myself and her are still in touch and that I have told her all about my current relationship, and that the only reason she’s never been introduced in person is because she believed that Chris was at university with me. Chris clarified that we are long distance now, and she replied that it must be so hard on him for me to be away at university while he is all alone.

This does not sit well with me. This girl is not just an innocent bystander to life. I have no reason to believe that my boyfriend would ever be interested in her and would therefore immediately act upon whatever she says, but her words are dangerous. If she felt any kind of remorse for her actions in the past, then she would not be casually chatting to my boyfriend while still not talking to me after 3 years. What makes this worse is Chris’ home city is Chloe’s university city. I have no doubt that she knows this, and will act upon it somehow.

I asked Chris what he thought to the messages, and he just thinks that they are harmless. He acknowledges that her actions directly correlate to the ending of a past relationship of mine, but says that he can see nothing malicious in her messages. I beg to differ. It could be paranoia, but I cannot see this as an innocent act. In an ideal world he would think the same as I do on this, however as he clearly does not I want to know if it is acceptable for me to ask him to either block or ignore her. I do not need this manipulator back in my life in any form.


TL;DR - ‘Friend’ broke up my past relationship because she wanted the guy all to herself; 3 years later she messages my LDR boyfriend out of the blue. Am I paranoid in wanting him to cut off contact?"
"My fiancé and I’s [24] friend [26] has become overly attached dog sitting our dog. We’re afraid he is going to steal him before we get back from vacation.


This sounds like a sit-com episode haha

We, in the spur of the moment, adopted a very sweet dog on Fourth of July, and kept him at our place for about 4 days. Unfortunately we had a already paid for vacation, so we asked a very good friend who loves dogs to watch our Phil Collins for $100. He took on the deal crazy fast, and has been taking very good care of him.

However, he has been sending us things like “You won’t be able to take him home.” And
“He loves me so much and now he goes by Mr Collins. Pretty sure he only will respond to Phil Collins by me so I think you guys shouldn’t call him that.” We assumed he was joking so we left it.

He apparently has also let other people watch him when he’s not home, and has told others that Phil Collins is indeed HIS dog.

We know he has been spoiling the dog like crazy. He has called out of work to be with the dog, he has been feeding the dog 3 times a day (with bones. He’s only about 20 lbs.) He’s letting this dog rule his life. Mega weirding us out since he is just dog sitting.

Then yesterday, he told us he has trained Phil Collins to walk without a leash. My fiancé decided to text him “Hey you’re doing great with him but we would be more comfortable if you used a leash no matter what.”

He blew up on us, telling us we abandoned him and how the dog is better off with him than us. All this stuff like “I am the only one who can give him what he needs” He even went so far to tell my fiancé that he should question his relationship with me if I’m okay with leaving the dog for a week with him. (?!) Fiancé asked if we should come pick the dog up right now (it’s an 7 hour drive) if he’s getting too emotionally attached to the dog. Friend say no, won’t let us FaceTime the dog, and is now not responding to our texts saying we will be there on Saturday at noon.

We want to be extra cautious and post here. What if we show up to his place and he’s not there and the dog isn’t there? We got Phil Collins microchipped and he is licensed under my name. And this guy was SUCH good friends with my fiancé, and now he’s super bummed out, feels betrayed, etc.

We’re considering cutting the vacation and leaving tomorrow instead of Saturday cuz we’re so nervous about it.

What should we do? Relationship wise and maybe legally? I also posted this situation r/legaladvice to see what they have to say.
Any help is appreciated!

TL;DR
Friend has gotten really weird dog sitting our dog. Says he’s better for him than we are. We’re afraid when we come back the dog will be gone. What do?"
"I [M/32] have just left my Wife [F/34] of just over 12 months after a relationship of 6 years.


 Just before Christmas she developed a friendship with a male work colleague, she told me about him and that she enjoyed his company, he would be there at their Christmas party and that they were talking together all evening. At this point she gave me a lot more attention and mentioned that she was doing it as she wanted to reassure me it was nothing more than friendship.

Fast forward to around Feb this year and on a Friday I am in work and something is niggling in my mind. I decide to use the find my iPhone app and low and behold she's in a location that is not her work, I call her and question her but not directly, asking her if she's working away at her desk for example to which she replies that she is. I then called her out on it an hour later and a big row erupts, her telling me my phone is wrong, she was there but not for the period of time that my phone was stating (it somehow preempted her location apparently). I want things to work as she is the only woman I have properly loved so we talk and I agree that I might have over reacted.

Fast forward again to mid June, she tells me that she's going out with her friends to watch a film we've already seen. That evening I get a phone call from my sister, she's has a bit bust up with my wife as she was 2 rows ahead of her in a different cinema to where she stated she would be with another man, my sister knows it's the same man as previously as I spoke to her about the previous situation. When challenging my wife on it she tells me they are just friends and she lied as she didn't want to hurt my feelings (knowing I have problems with them spending time because they lie about it). One of the things that really hurt me there is that they went to watch a film we had booked to see 2 days later.

Now last Thursday I get a text off my sister asking if my wife was wearing a particular outfit that day, I confirmed what she was wearing and I then get a text back mentioning that she had been seen in the open all over kissing and hugging another man, I question my sister and she confirms that my wife had left in a car that matches the car my wife drives. The person that said they saw her and text my sister was prompted by my sister to look up someone on facebook and she confirms it's the same man she saw my wife with at the cinema a few weeks earlier. I question my wife and she lies and tells me she was somewhere else with him and her friends can confirm it. I moved into another room that evening and eventually left home on the Saturday.

Now today I have left her but having to deal with the divorce and eventual sale of house we bought a mere 15 months ago as well as a holiday to Florida we had planned in October that I am now not going to. I am upset as she has 2 children that I helped raise and spent a lot of time and effort with for 6 years and I am forced to up and leave through betrayal.

I'm in a dark place but thankfully friends and family have supported me.

I feel a little better just getting this out, someone please tell me I am not simply over reacting. I feel relationships are based on trust and the fact that she has suddenly got her phone permanently attached to her and refusing to show my text exchanges between them coupled with the events above the trust has been decimated.

Till this day she still won't admit she's done anything wrong.

 **Tl:dr-Wife has been spending time with another man and lying about it, finally recieved confirmation from third party that she's cheated. Feeling vulnerable and crappy.**"
"My [21 F] older FWB [42 M] is mad I don't want to invite him to college parties




Embarrassing fact... I prefer sex with older guys. Just find them more attractive, more considerate in bed, it's nice seeing someone who can afford to take me on dates other than shitty college town bars.

But I recognize an actual relationship with an older guy probably wouldn't work out too well, due to being in different stages of life and all. So I've had a couple older FWBs, and kept things really casual. That's where Jonathan comes in. I've been hooking up with him for about 6 months, but keeping things really casual.

My friends know about my FWBs, they don't get it, but they don't judge too much. They do joke a bunch about my ""sugar daddies"" sometimes, but not in a mean way.

A few times a month, I'll hang out with my group of friends, going to parties, or bars, and staying out late. We're a group of college student athletes; some undergrad and some in grad school. 

----

Jonathan started asking me about coming to parties a few months ago, and I said I just wanted to go and catch up with my friends, I'd see him another time. Or that it was a college party, so it didn't seem like it would be his scene.

That wasn't the whole truth, honestly an older guy just wouldn't fit in with my friends who are all in their early 20s. And I didn't want things to be awkward, I just wanted to go have fun with my friends without having to worry about the guy I brought not fitting in with anyone there, and having to stick to my side the whole night.

Recently, I casually mentioned to Jonathan that I was going out with a few of my friends and their boy toys. Later, he asked me if these ""boy toys"" came to a lot of our parties. I basically said they do sometimes, but I don't really get to know them too well because it's usually not a long term thing.

He got upset with me, since I had said in the past I just wanted to have friend time, but it turns out that a lot of my friends were bringing their FWBs or dates to parties. I said ""Yeah well they're all in their 20s, so it's different. Like when my friend Jess brought her FWB Matt, he went and mingled and hung out with everyone easily because he's a student too and had plenty to talk about with them. If you came, I don't see that happening.""

He basically argued about that, but I know my friends, they wouldn't have much to talk about with him, and would probably be weirded out by him being there. Nobody wants a 42 year old hanging around a college party.

He's been really passive agressive since that conversation, saying stuff about my friends being ""too cool"" and stuff.

I've tried to say how that annoys me, but he keeps doing it.

Should I just cave and bring him to a college party? So he can see it's as awkward as I'm expecting? My friends think that would be funny to do, but I don't want to cause drama.

TLDR - My older FWB wants to come to college parties, and got passive agressive about me saying no

"Husband (32) is furious because I (27) bought him a birthday gift


My husband is furious at me because for his birthday I decided to go all out. I did this because we don’t spend money on dates and our anniversary/my birthday so I wanted to make it special. 

It’s not like we’re poor. We pay the bills on time and have regular debts like car payment and school loans. We’re middle class. He just doesn’t like spending money. 

We’ve been having a lot of relationship issues but thanks to therapy I thought we had turned a corner. 

I paid to have his car detailed (it looked like the inside of teenagers car) and I bought him a bottle of Oban (90$). When he opened the Oban he yelled at me right away asking what I thought I was doing getting something so expensive. I burst into tears and he apologized for yelling and said he loved it but obviously the feelings were strained after that. 

Then last night he was quiet so I asked him what was wrong and he said he was very upset and insulted that I spent that much money on him knowing how he doesn’t like to spend money. He accused me of not knowing him and that he would have preferred a dollar store mug with his name on it. He also said now he would have to work overtime this week to make up for the money wasted. 

Did I do something wrong? I never thought I would be getting yelled at for buying someone a gift. A gift that he appears to have no problem drinking. (After he saw it and was upset I offered to take it back for a refund and he refused). We share finances so I don’t see how this could be a money issue. 

TL;DR husband is mad because for his birthday I tried to spoil him. "
"My husband [27M] thinks that if I [25F] ask him to keep something between us that is asking him to lie.


A few months back something extremely personal happened to me and I of course told my husband (I did not do anything wrong- it was just one of life’s unavoidable misfortunes and I was just embarrassed by it). We agreed to keep it between us and our parents. I didn’t want to tell his parents but he said he didn’t want them worrying about us since I was visibly upset (found out this news right before family thanksgiving) so I agreed. Fast forward to a few days ago and a stranger from our apartment complex, someone whom I know is a neighbor but don’t know their name, approached me and began asking me about the issue we agreed to keep private. I confronted my husband and he swore he only told him because he doesn’t know us and isn’t in our circle. Admittedly I wouldn’t let it go and kept asking him who he had told and he then admitted to telling multiple family and friends but said that it was my fault because I asked him to lie by not telling them (but apparently lying to me was okay). After a huge argument he apologized for lying to me but still insists that asking him to keep things private is asking him to lie. More distressing is that his family seems to share this notion and told me that I was being ridiculous. 

I feel betrayed and saddened that my husband will no longer be able to be my confidant because telling him a personal detail is equivalent to announcing it on social media. He has betrayed my trust and told multiple people something I find deeply embarrassing.  How do I convince him that simply not telling people all your business is not the same as a lie? I understand the concept of a “lie of omission” but surely there are acceptable boundaries. He says he is an extrovert and keeping secrets is stressful for him and he doesn’t like people to worry. I’d like to know I’m not crazy. Perhaps I’m a horrible person but I wish I had a husband who would lie for me if I asked him to. 

We have been together for 7 years. 4 years dating and 3 married- I suppose nothing in this area has come up before because were usually an open book. 

Tl;dr is keeping things personal between a husband and wife the same things as lying? "
"I [24 F] blocked my best friend's [25 M] girlfriend [20 F] on social media. It caused a lot of drama, she thinks I'm interfering in their relationship.


My best friend Jon started dating a girl, Melissa, a few months ago. I met her a few times at parties, and our personalities kinda clashed, she came off as very overbearing, and I'm more laid back. I was never rude to her, I just ended up spending more time with my friends than time getting to know her.

Last Saturday night, I was drunk, and got an Instagram DM from someone who's handle I didn't recognize. Basically telling me off for trying to take her boyfriend, and for having no respect. It was really long and I didn't read more than the first few sentences, I just blocked the sender because I figured it wasn't meant for me.

I got a Snapchat from the same handle later that night, when I was even more drunk. I opened it and it was just a black background with a similar angry message typed on it. If I was sober-er, I would have realized it must have come from someone I'd accepted as a friend; someone I knew, but I didn't make that connection at the time. I just blocked the sender on Snapchat too.

I forgot about it until Jon asked me today why I'd blocked Melissa. I completely forgot about the messages I got while drunk, and said ""Uh I didn't, why?"" He said she told him she tried to talk to me about relationship boundaries and I blocked her. I still didn't make the connection. He was talking about things in such a reasonable way, I just didn't connect it with the crazy messages I'd got when I was drunk off my ass.

He believed me, and believed Melissa was making something up to stir up shit. 

He called me up later today, and said he and Melissa had a blow up fight about it, he realized she was being honest and I was not, and he said he didn't think we could be friends at the moment because of it. 

It was only then that it hit me that I actually had blocked Melissa. 

I don't know if I owe them both an apology. I don't feel bad about blocking someone who cussed me out, out of the blue. But I realize I kinda caused their fight today 

TLDR - I blocked my best friend's girlfriend because age sent me an angry message and I didn't know it was her. It's caused a lot of drama.

"I (35F) just confronted the neighbor (20M) about tresspassing in my yard


My husband and I have lived here about a year and a half. I don't know this neighbor very well, and I'm guessing he's about 20-22. His mother is a single mom, and I've only ever seen glimpses of her leaving for work. They live across the street. The neighbor next to me is an elderly woman who lives alone, and then the other house has been for sale for the past two months now. 

Ever since the one house has been for sale/empty, I started noticing the neighbor boy hanging out at it with his pitbull, in the backyard. He'd be sitting at the back porch, the dog would be unleashed, and wandering in my yard too, peeing in my garden, etc. I asked him several times to keep his dog out of my yard, and he was polite, but not complying. He didn't necessarily seem up to no good, but he seemed to lack awareness to the fact that he probably shouldn't hang out at an empty property.

I started seeing him more and more at my back yard. Theres nothing behind my house but woods, so no need to be there. My husband is military and would be gone for trainings and I'd be home alone. I didn't like this situation and felt uncomfortable.  One day I was at the side of my house between my house and the elderly neighbors home and he came walking up to me. I think he didn't expect me to be there. He said ""my bad"" and ran off before I could say anything. I started wondering if he was cutting through the side of my house to get to the back yard. I *really* didn't like that. 

Today, he was again in my back yard with the pitbull and it was peeing in my garden. I told him ""I don't want you or your dog in my yard please"". He went over to the empty house for awhile. I waited to see if he would cut through the side of my yard to get back to the street. When he did I went to the front door and again told him ""do not go in yard"" he ignored me, I said ""acknowledge what I just said to you"" and he nodded.

I'm not trying to start a war with the neighbor, and I don't want to overreact. But do you think my instincts are right about this? Would it be worth it to call the police and have him trspassed if this happens again?

TLDR: neighbor keeps coming in my yard, am I overreacting or should I have him trespassed?"
"I [29M] feel like my gf [23F] needs social media for validation




My girlfriend and i have been together for 4 months. Things are going great! But, i have a slight issue. So basically ever since i asked my gf to be exclusive she has been posting us on Facebook. I don’t mind her posting about us but, sometimes i feel like she wants the world to know she’s taken and the way she portrays it is as if I’m a trophy or something. For example she will post things like “stay out of my inbox I’m taken” (i feel like she posts this to draw attention to herself and to let it be known that guys want her and to leave her alone)



She will tag me in everything ... even simple Facebook questions. My first day being official she changed her Facebook status to in a relationship and three days later she asked me to change mines too.
She followed me on Instagram and asked me to follow her back. When i buy her things she post them on Facebook.
I feel like she validates our relationship through Facebook where as to me i don’t want our relationship based on social media


TL:DR; idk if it’s because I’m older or what but I’ve been in a situation where a woman posted me so much and then when we broke up i felt like the whole world knew. That’s why i don’t post too much of my business on social media because once the relationship ends or if something were to happen then... those posts,photos,pictures ... were a waste .."
"How do I[21f] tell my [bf25m] that I don't always want to have sex without making him upset?


Hi, as the title says, my boyfriend almost always want to have sex. Sometimes it's not the right time for me, like if I'm not in the mood or sore from the last time we had sex. However, whenever I've told him I wasn't in the mood he got really upset. 

Today he kept touching me and even though I kept pulling his hands off he wouldn't stop and eventually pinned my arms down and started having sex with me. I didn't tell him to stop because I was afraid he'd get mad but I told him it hurt and he kept going. What can I do better to avoid this happening again?

**tl;dr my bf and I dont always agree on when to have sex**"
"My [21] parents have gone non-contact with my sister [24] for being gay.


My parents have been Christians since I was about three. My mom has talked about how Christianity saved her marriage so they are very connected to the church, almost like without their shared theology they wouldn't have a relationship at all. This provides some context for their fixation on Christianity.    

My older sister \[23\] is gay and I \[21\] am bisexual. I'm lucky in that my bisexuality allows me to appear ""normal"" (i.e. maintain a heterosexual relationship) whereas my sister has never had the opportunity to share a romantic involvement with her immediate family, apart from me. It's just us, our parents, and our little brother who is 15 and still at home.    

Today a massive argument broke out between my sister and mother because my mother snooped around on Instagram and ""found by chance, just by opening Instagram!"" a photo of my sister and her girlfriend kissing at Pride. Which is funny in and of itself because her girlfriend has a private account so my mother, who has a history of snooping, had some serious obstacles in her way to find this photo. She has created fake accounts that look like younger women in order to be accepted into private accounts. (Yes, my mother is a big gay-hating catfish.)    

My mother thinks that it was selfish and deceitful for my sister to hide the relationship from her, when she definitely knew all along. My sister came out at 17 and they kicked her out. They let her back in when she said she was ""straight again"". Eyeroll.    

So essentially my mother knew my sister was gay, but pretended not to, pried into a private account to prove it to herself, and then verbally attacked my sister for not telling her.    

I had a discussion with her over the phone urging her to understand that a child would never admit to something that would compromise the love their parents have for them. I told her that I think it's pathetic that her theology would get in the way of a relationship with her child. And I told her that makes her love for her children conditional, and that even if she loves me I know that there are things I could do to lose that love, and how that makes her love for me fake. They are no longer allowing us to see our little brother and won't accept us in their homes.    

I am strong enough to understand that my parents have a flawed ideology and it's not my sister's wrongdoing that has sparked this, but rather a narcissistic worldview that makes them feel better somehow.    

I want to encourage anyone with families that shut them out for religious reasons, specifically involving sexuality, which isn't a choice. All we have is the knowledge that there is a hate in their hearts that can either grow with time or crumble. I hope every day that my sister can feel the love of her parents, but until that day, and even if it never comes, she has me.    

My aunt– my father's sister– is gay. My grandparents, who were very staunch Catholics, came to the conclusion that to choose between the faith and their own daughter was heartbreaking. My grandmother told me, ""I'd rather my daughter be alive and gay, then dead and pretending."" She is dying right now, just pumped full of morphine for her pain as she's in late stage Alzheimer's. My dad went to see her before she dies yesterday. Weird how this timed up so perfectly that my mother could make this day all about herself.    

Every day presents a new challenge and I must admit my heart is hardened towards Christianity because of my mother.    

How do you separate the good parts of your childhood from the parts of your parents that make you frustrated and unloved? Or is that just a fact of life? I guess more than anything else I just want to know that other people go through this, too, and I want insight into what others have done in my position.    

TLDR: My parents are Christians and are cutting off my sister (and me, but because I support her). Looking for advice, encouraging words, and other outlooks on this.   "
"I [25 F] woke up to my [29 M] fiancé of four years masterbating to his ex.


Not sure how to feel yet. We have already talked to each other about the situation and I am still left with hurt feelings and feeling very self conscious. He explained that re visiting old sexual experiences is something he sometimes uses during self pleasure, and that he does not still have feeling for his ex.I am trying not to make this personal, but I am struggling.

Is this a typical thing for folks even though they are in a committed relationship? I of course am interpreting this as he is still hemmed up on this woman, and he is not sexually satisfied. 

TLDR; Fiancé getting off to picture of his ex girlfriend, I am upset and trying to get some perspective on this. "
"Me [29F] with my sister [21F]; I feel like she's been an incredibly rude house guest.


Hi Reddit - 

So my younger sister was discharged from the Army, and has come to visit me while she looks for a job and an apartment in my town. I've had her stay with me for a few weeks at a time before, never with any issue, but this time it just seems so much worse. 

The problems began before she even arrived. She texted me that she needed money because she missed a connecting flight on her way here. She had a 22 hour layover, and told me she'd rented a car and went to buy some weed and visit a gym... So in my mind, she had plenty of cash to be doing these things. Apparently not so, because when she missed her flight, she didn't even have the $150 to get on a new one. This really threw me for a loop, because I didn't realize how broke she was... And when I'm broke, I don't do things like rent cars and buy weed. 

Immediately upon arriving, she began helping herself to my weed. I left the invitation kind of open, which was maybe my fault, but it got out of hand really quickly. We went through 5 gram cartridges and a puck of wax in five days. I had to physically retrieve my vape from her bed each morning--after I'd go to bed, she'd just take it to her bed with her I guess, and vape until she fell asleep.

The next thing was she basically ate me out of house and home. I usually make a casserole on Sundays and my husband and I eat the leftovers for lunch during the week. When I made my Sunday casserole, she ate the other ~8 servings. She ate all my ice cream. She drank 2 gallons of almond milk in three days. She polished off my husband's snack packs. I made a pie and she ate half that night. Maybe it's related to the amount she was smoking, I'm not sure. I just got really tired of being out of every single thing when I opened the fridge or cabinet to get it... She never told me when she would finish off an item.

This leads to the next issue... I don't mind paying for things, like groceries for guests or the occasional meal out, etc. But due to the fact she arrived without any means or money, I've been essentially supporting my sister. When she asked me for a ride to the clinic, she actually came to me in the waiting room *after her exam* and asked me to pay ""because she didn't have any money."" I feel like she misrepresented her financial situation and is now expecting me to support her. At one point, when I mentioned she needed to cut back on her weed intake or contribute, she just said, ""I'll get you back--throw it on my tab."" I felt like shouting ""I'M NOT A LENDING SERVICE.""

When people visit, I always am very clear that I do not allow my cat outside. She's an indoor-only kitty. It's not really an issue, she's not an escape artist. She pretty much ignores the human comings-and-goings, and doesn't dash at the open door. But my sister would leave the door ajar, and just walk off. I gently reminded her not to do that, for the safety of my kitty and my dog. After she kept doing it, I would shout at her to ""CLOSE THE DOOR PLEASE!"" from wherever I was. She'd always scurry back and close it. But yesterday I got a text from my neighbor (who has two large dogs who think cats are snacks) that my cat had run into his house and was too terrified to catch. I was about to sit for an exam, and I was shaking so bad I couldn't write. My neighbor managed to get my kitty back into my apartment safely, but I was shook. In her 5 years, my cat has never made it that far from the house. She so easily could have been killed or lost forever.

Last night I finally had it after she let my cat escape, and snapped at her. She's now avoiding me and acting like I flew off the handle for no reason. How do I communicate that I love her and I want to be there for her, but she can't treat me like this??

TL;DR: 

My sister has been staying with me while looking for a job. She's acting like she expects me to support her. She's asked me to pay for some things (despite the fact I'm a student with no income) and has helped herself as much as she wants to my weed and food. As a kicker, after several warnings about it, she let my indoor-only cat outside. After getting pissed off at her about the cat, somehow I'm the bad guy."
"My[M25] girlfriend[24] of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommate[M25]. I just heard them through the wall.


As the title says, we broke up. It was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. We broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. Admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so I can see why it happened.

This isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any PDA while I'm around. I still both consider them friends and I just want them to be happy.

For the most part, they are quiet at night. If I really listen I can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. Except for last night. We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.

I don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. I've been okay with the break up until now, I'm glad they're happy but last night I fell asleep crying.

I woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.

Feel free to ignore this, I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm sad when I really think about the situation, but that's why I try not to.

TL;DR: My ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night. "
"Me [30/F] with my husband [35 M/F] of 10 years. He's a jerk EVERY Sunday


Husband gets angry and blames me for things that aren't my fault, (and aren't really even worth getting angry about). It stresses me out, and makes me feel like I am walking on egg shells. 

Its worse on Sundays, and every Sunday follows the same pattern like clockwork. He says it is because he doesn't want to go to work the next day. I get that he doesn't like work, but its not my fault. 

I'm on maternity leave at the moment, but this has been going on for a long time (well before I was pregnant). I always told myself I was being silly, and by Monday evening he's fine again. I don't want to do this anymore though. I'm fed up, and am worried that the weekly tension will start to affect the baby, when she is old enough to recognize it. 

I do challenge him now and again, pointing out that a particular thing is not my fault, or that half of the mess is his things on the floor, or just ignoring the comments. He just moves onto something else a few minutes later though, so nothing is solved. Its like he is trying to start an argument, or to put me down so he feels better. Later he denies any of it. Can't work out if he is aware he's even doing it?


Is there a name for this behavior? How do I make it stop without causing more fights?


Examples:
Today he was baking. He couldn't find the pans, because he shoves everything in the cupboards without tidying up after himself. Starts talking loudly and banging around, criticizing me for ""moving everything all the time"".


He was wiping down the surfaces after dinner, loudly saying ""look how I do it"". I was holding the baby, so thought it was a joke, realized he was passive aggressively aiming the comments at me. The counters are wiped down properly every evening, comments were bizarre, and unnecessary.


He started the dishwasher as he went to bed. This was a jerk move. He knows it is loud and drowns out the noise of the tv (watching as I nurse the baby). He goes to bed much earlier than I do because of work, so it doesn't affect him. 


He starts  telling me all the things he has done this weekend, in a tone of voice that implies I am lazier than him. The main reason he is able to all of these things is because I am sitting patiently looking after the baby while he does them.


Most of our arguments center around chores and cleaning up with him starting them. I do the bulk of the housework, but he always seems to imply that he contributes more than me, like its a competition.


TLDR: Husband is grumpy and passive aggressive towards me. Causes stress and tension EVERY Sunday. 


Question: Is there a name for this behavior? How do I fix it?"
"Me [62 F] with my married daughter [31 F]. She had her 3rd baby 2 months ago and is acting crazy


She has had mental health issues in the past (depression?) but refuses to try any medication.  Since her recent baby was born she has become extremely jealous with her husband.  She gets hysterical if she thinks he is looking at another woman.  

Then this morning is was like someone flipped a switch on her.  She is now extremely jealous of her own daughters, aged 2 months, 3, and 7.  She thinks her husband has sexual feelings for the daughters.  She says he hasn't acted on the feelings, but she is convinced he is lusting after them.  She is hysterical about it. 

She started sending me texts about it this morning.  I told her she sounded crazy.  She claims he has admitted to lusting after the girls, but only after she forced him to admit it.  

Then she started saying when she was a girl her father had lustful thoughts about her.  She admits he never acted on the thoughts, but she claims she knows he had the thoughts.  Her father and I have been  married for over 40 years and have other grown children.  She said she was going to text her father and tell him.  

I showed all the texts to my husband.  He was stunned.  He tried to call her, but she said she didn't want to talk in front of the kids.  
so he told her to call him when she could.  She didn't call.  

In the texts she has said she is going to our family doctor and telling him everything about the lustful thoughts her father had, and her husband now has.  

This is about as crazy as she has ever been.  My husband and I are very stressed.  She made our lives hell when she was a teenager by drinking and taking drugs and staying out all night, stealing from us, etc.  But we supported her as best we could and she eventually came out of that phase.  Now this fresh type of hell has broken out.  

After her second baby was born she was being violent towards her husband (hitting, scratching), and this caused the kids to be taken away for a few months.  She was in the hospital for two weeks.  It was a nightmare.  

We love our grandkids very much and are especially worried about them.   (We are also worried about my daughter and her husband).   We are extremely worried about what will happen next.  

tldr:  my grown daughter thinks her husband has lustful thoughts about their daughters, and she thinks her own father had lustful thoughts about her when she was a girl.  She is destroying her marriage.

"I’ve (26/F) been dating a married man (30/M) for the past five months without knowing.


We met at a work event roughly a year ago. I was with my ex at the time, so nothing happened. But months later, after my ex and I had parted ways, I ran into the  work event guy at a distant friend’s dinner party. We talked, he said he had moved to London since we last saw each other, but also that he comes to Vancouver often. Usually for work and usually for a week every month or so. 

We got along really well, exchanged numbers and met for coffee two days later. I’m not on social media, so it didn’t even occur to me to search him up on anything. I feel like that was the first big mistake that I made. In any case, I don’t go into dating situations expecting to find some massive secret. This guy was really smart, funny and easy to talk to, and he was the first person I felt that I had truly connected with since my ex. 

When he asked to go on a date with me the next time he was in the city, I agreed. We went out, had a great time, etc. That week, we spent five out of seven days together. The next time he was there, it was the same thing. I wasn’t necessarily looking for a relationship or to date the same person for very long, not after being with my ex for years and having it fall apart so swiftly. I wanted to date a bit and have fun, but mostly focus on me. He was on the same page. 

So, even though it wasn’t a relationship, we definitely had the energy of a couple when we were in the same city, and (to my knowledge) we weren’t seeing anyone else. Two months into it, I finally decided to bring him around my friends. They’re all really nice people, not the type to immediately look into someone’s history unless something feels off about them. Suffice to say nothing felt off about this guy. They all loved him. My brother briefly met him as well, and said he was cool. 

Maybe just compared to my ex. 

In any case, we’ve been dating for five months now. I had the most amazing date with him last night. It was the first time we talked about turning what we have into a real relationship. I wasn’t ready before, but after a bit of thought, I decided I’ll probably never be ready unless I try. He felt the same, but I noticed he turned a little distant after. At first I thought maybe I’d scared him off, but he was the one who had started all of the relationship talk when we were back at my apartment. 

I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing. He proceeded to kiss me and tell me how he wishes he’d met me sooner. He says that a lot, and I’ve always just thought that he means it in the sense that he wishes we had known each other sooner so we could have been together sooner. I don’t know. I’ve never given it much thought. Last night was the first time I really sat down and thought about it, and although I wasn’t sure what it was about it that made me curious, I knew it had to be *something*. 

This next part probably shouldn’t have happened the way it did and although I wish I’d found out differently, I’m glad that I found out at all. 

Basically, when he was in the shower, I stared picking our clothes up from the floor so I could fold them and take away some of the mess. When I picked his coat up, his phone fell out of one of the pockets. Except it wasn’t the phone that I’d seen him use. That one was charging at my desk. At first I just figured this other phone was just his work phone or something. He had never mentioned a work phone to me before, and he definitely had the chance to do so, as I have a work phone of the same make as this other one and I’m always complaining about how slow it is compared to my personal phone. 

Either way, as I lifted it from the floor to put it back in the pocket it had fallen out from, the screen came to life and I saw that his background on this phone was of him and a woman I’d never seen before. They were holding each other at the beach somewhere, and he was kissing her cheek. Clearly a couple photo. Not only that ... she had a ring on her finger. 

I stared at it for a good minute and then quickly put it back when he finished his shower. He came out, told me that he was going to order something for us to eat and maybe open the wine that he’d brought over. I just smiled and nodded, completely taken aback by what I had seen, and uncertain as to how I should go about handling it. 

It was only as he brought two glasses of wine with him to the bedroom, that I asked him if he liked going to the beach. I don’t know why I started out with that question, it just happened that way. He seemed a bit confused, but he said he liked the beach anyway. He asked if I wanted to go to the beach tomorrow, and I said no. I also refused the glass of wine he’d given me and then grabbed my work phone and asked if he had a charger for that particular make that I could use. He looked at me all confused again, and I said something along the lines of, “Oh, do you not have a charger for the phone in your coat? How stupid of me to assume you would.” 

He froze up, nearly dropped the wine all of my floors, and then immediately said, “I can explain.” 

I told him that he had ten seconds to explain before I was going to kick him out of my apartment. 

He said something like, “It’s a loveless marriage. She means nothing to me anymore. We don’t even live in the same house in London. She’s seeing someone else now. That photo is from a year ago.” 

Except he was wearing a shirt that I bought him in the photo, and they actually looked really happy together, not what you’d expect from a married couple that had fallen out of love and moved into separate houses. 

I grabbed the phone out of his coat, pointed the shirt out to him. Again he froze up. I could see that he was trying really hard to think of any excuse he could, but there wasn’t one good enough to explain the fact that he had apparently been cheating on his wife with me for five months. 

He said, “You’re the one that I love. I know it’s wrong of me to have done this to you and to her. I would have left her years ago if our families hadn’t put such high expectations on us. I thought I loved her. Part of me does and always will, but the truth is I’m not happy with her. I’m happy with you. The past five months with you have been the best five months of my life. Please don’t turn me away. Please.” 

It was a whole bunch of that, said to me in different ways as I threw his clothes at him. 

He ended up agreeing to leave my apartment, texted me a bunch from his hotel, called, etc. I put my phone on silent and started searching for everything I could. I got one of my friends to help me as well, and he was the one who managed to find the wife’s event planning page. She’s really beautiful and seems really good at what she does. It breaks my heart to think of what I’ve unknowingly been a part of. I have her email and a bunch of screenshots of messages and things. I just need to figure out how to say it and what to say, what details I should include, etc. 

I’ve never been in a situation like this before. One of my other friends advised me to just stay out of it and focus on myself, as it’s going to turn into more drama than it’s worth. The drama part, I agree with. There’s now way this is going to be a clean email exchange. She could be the smartest, most levelheaded woman in London, but at the end of the day, her husband has been cheating on her with me, so any contact from me would probably be received badly at least in some way. 

I’d rather know than not know, though. As someone who was cheated on in the past. I already know he’s not going to tell just based on the way he responded to me when I asked him about it. 

How do I go about this in the cleanest possible way? 

**tl;dr** I have his wife’s email. How do I go about this in a way that’s best for her? How do I word it? What should I include? I’ve got screenshots to prove that I didn’t know until late last night. I feel sick thinking about what I’ve done, even without knowing.

"I [26F] just watched my fiancé [25M] drive away from me. We were supposed to get married next week.


I don’t really know where to start or what to say. 
He cited political differences as his reason. He said he’s miserable with me &amp; cant be with me another day. 

I feel as if someone pulled the rug out from under me. This came completely out of the blue. We haven’t fought today, we were having a standard Monday, even joking around right before it happened. 

He broke down crying &amp; said he’s deeply depressed. Said he needs to be with his family. Promised he loves me a million times, told me to keep my ring on my finger and that he’d be back in exactly 2 weeks, when my family would still be here (family that’s coming in for us getting married presumably, whom he knows). 

Then, not even 5 min after he left, he texts me that he lied, he isn’t in love with me anymore, etc. I’m just shell shocked. 

I haven’t cried yet because I’m just stunned, but I’m sure I will soon. I also took work off tomorrow because I need to process this. It almost feels like someone died and I haven’t caught on yet. Idk how to explain it. 

How do I move on from this? How do I cope with a failed engagement? Is it cold feet? How can I possibly imagine myself with another person? 

Sorry if I did this wrong or anything. I just know that come morning, I’m going to be hurting. The worst part of all is I thought I was done hurting bc of things like this. 

I hate this. 

TL;DR: fiancé spontaneously packed up, left, and said it’s done. Five minutes prior gave a completely different reason. Don’t know how to cope. Help please. "
"I (21F) might have located my adopted brother (8M)


Long story short, I was brought up with a very abusive mother and father. Left home when I was 16, lived with friends, boyfriends anything until I was able to afford to live on my own. (18). I am all fine and okay but I found out my birth mom had three more children after me. I know about two of them and have met them but I found out about the third. We have the same mother but a different father, his dad also abused me when I was younger but died from an overdose. My brother lives just a half hour from my boyfriend and I. He was adopted right after he was born due to my birth mom not being a suitable parent. 

I really want to reach out and see if the adoptive family would be interested in letting my brother and I meet. But how weird is some chick claiming to be a sister to this little boy? But I also don’t want to just show up out of nowhere or write to him, what if he doesn’t know he’s adopted? I’m nothing like my mother and dropped all contact with her a very long time ago due to her abuse. I don’t know, Reddit. He’s 8 and I would have to wait ten more years to reach out. Any advice would be more than welcome!! 

TL;Dr: I may have located my little brother whom has been adopted since birth. Wondering what to do. "
"Someone Discovered We're Related at Work


So my sibling (24F) and I (24F) work at the same summer camp. This is my nth year here and this is her first time. She was able to apply on her own merits and did what they asked her to do. One of the ladies at HR told her to change her address for information just because apparently siblings are not supposed to work together. However, we really don't interact with each other as we have different stations and our shift times differ by about an hour. And we don't see each other as much. They only thing that was a hint was that we had the same last names. This managed to help us stay clear after five weeks (of an eight week camp). Somehow one person (48F) found a photo of us on Facebook together and put two and two together and show other counselors that we were siblings. I knew that we could get found out, but these counselors didn't want to shut up about it. They also took their phone and shoved it infront of my sister's face proving it. As far as we know, my sibling and I did our jobs well and followed what the higher ups wanted from us. If we have to get fired from this job, we're not gonna make a fuss about it, but was it fair for my co-workers to do that? 

**TL;DR** Someone found out that my sibling and I worked at the same place online and showed it off.

"My girlfriend [F24] just told me [M24] that my job embarrassed her in front of others.


I love her to death and our chemistry has been fantastic for most of the almost three years we have been dating. For perspective on the situation, we come from different financial backgrounds. Her family payed for her education/rent/etc and mine could not afford to do so. This resulted in me having to work quite a bit during my time in school to cover expenses while she has not. I have held food service jobs mostly and still do while I finish my last year of college. She is in her career field and loving it which makes me over the moon happy to see.

Recently after a barbecue, she brought up the fact that I was still in school and how much it bothered her. Given that she seemed a little off at the barbecue after introductions were made I asked her if it was because I told everyone what my job was and she said yes. This bothered me because I have always felt that I worked very hard to inch my way to something I'm proud of and my job right now is only a stepping stone until I graduate. Am I wrong to be bothered by this?

**TL;DR: My girlfriend told me she was embarrassed by my food service job** "
"I [24F] had an allergic reaction to something my boyfriend's mom [50sF] cooked. She won't give me the recipe to find out what it was because it's a ""family secret.""


We've been dating for 2.5 years, normally my boyfriend's mom is a very kind, reasonable lady. Over the holiday we stopped by her house very briefly to say hello and hang out for a bit. She was having a neighborhood party later that evening so she had cooked up a bunch of stuff. She asked right before we left if we wanted to try one of the dishes she had tried. She was super excited about it, it's an old recipe from her grandma, etc. We tried it. Admittedly it was super delicious. We then got in the car and left.

On the ride home my throat/mouth started to get really itchy. It wasn't anything too severe, I didn't feel the need to go to the hospital or anything. But it was definitely some kind of mild allergic reaction.

Now, I don't have any allergies, so I had no idea what caused it. The next day my boyfriend called asking what was in the dish so that I can avoid it in the future. 

She refused to tell him because it's a secret recipe. Honestly I thought she was joking. I thought super guarded, ""secret recipes"" were a thing from cheesy TV and housewives of the 1950s. We told her she doesn't even have to give us the amounts or anything, just what was in it so maybe I could figure out what the ingredient I've never had before was.

She said she was so sorry but she just couldn't do it. That it was ""probably"" not going to be an issue because I've never had an allergic reaction before, right? After a lot of back and forth when it was clear she wasn't budging we dropped it. The most helpful thing we got out of her was her asking if I've had pineapple before. Yes, I love pineapple. It's not that. 

So I have nothing. I don't know what the fuck to do about it. I mean she's probably right, if I've been blindly eating food for 24 years and never had a problem it *probably* won't suddenly become an issue. It must be something super obscure. But at the same time...we 100% have the ability to find out what it was. It's not like I ate some random dish at a restaurant I'll never go back to, it was my boyfriend's mother! 

At this point I'm ready to drop it but I honestly have no idea what to do/say when I see her again. She's always been so nice and courteous and this is just so fucking weird. What the hell do I do? 

**TL;DR: My boyfriend's mom fed me something I had an allergic reaction to and won't give me the recipe because it's a family secret. I don't know what the hell to do when I see her again.**"
"My [19F] male friend [41M] says the fact I don’t want to fuck him is a major personality flaw on my end. I’ve felt bad ever since and I’m considering cutting ties. Should I?


So I have known him for 3 years and we are pretty close. As of late it seems as though his true colors are beginning to reveal themselves to me.

Last night we were talking about something random and funny then he said “Yeah and you don’t want to have anything to do with me outside of friendship which is a major personality flaw on your end. I have known this for a while now.” This shocked and upset me. This came out of the blue. Our conversation was actually fun and I was enjoying it.... then he suddenly said that without any provocation at all. I reread our messages and there was nothing I said to make him give me that response. It really hurt me.

I told him he just likes starting drama and wanted to upset me and he just said, “Well you do the same thing.” I don’t understand. Why would he say this to me? Should I cut ties with him? :(

**TL;DR My friend and I were having a fun convo when he told me he knew I didn’t want to fuck him which is apparently a major personality flaw on my end**"
"I [ F26] had to report someone at work, now people at the office are upset


There was another girl who reported him as well, but generally I'm getting the impression everyone thinks I'm overreacting. It was clearly sexual harassment but everyone thinks he would never do such a thing.

Some people are ignoring me. Some people are straight up consoling him, checking up on him, making sure he's ok, doing things to cheer him up.

It's become kind of a mind fuck for me because it took a lot for me to come forward. I keep telling myself they're wrong and not to worry about it but it's hard. I keep telling myself that people will have friends backs no matter what they do sometimes. 

It seems like people are upset that I ruined the office's fun vibe. I just don't want to be hated for something I really felt like I had to do. And obviously it wouldn't hurt if someone asked me if I was ok...

Tldr:
The office is upset I reported someone. I get the feeling people have teamed up and taken his side. It makes me feel bad. What do I do? "
"Me [40 M] with my wife [49 F] 10 years, she placed offer on house despite the fact we disagreed on purchasing said house.


My wife and I were house shopping and she found a house she was absolutely in love with.  I was ok with it but had some reservations.  Primarily, it was worth 80K more than other houses in the neighborhood and I wasn't too big on the city/neighborhood.  We agreed on a lowball offer, stating that if they rejected it, we'd move on.  It was rejected and she wanted to update to a more competitive offer and I said I didn't want to because the house wasn't worth it.

She pouted and stopped participating in the process though I'd forward houses I thought we'd like to her and she'd find faults w/ them.  Over the last 2 days, she's been really pushing for the house and I was ready to acquiesce and compromise, ""Happy Wife, Happy Life"" and all.  She even stated, ""Well, I'm going to go ahead.""  I voiced my reservation w/ that approach and she made a snarky remark.  Considering that a home purchase is a big deal to me, my first, but not to her, I was disappointed w/ her disregard of my opinion in the home buying process but it wasn't the end of the world.  Eventually I agreed to upgrade the offer, only to find out that she had already done so weeks ago and was at the inspection stage.

When I confronted her, her response was that she was just trying to get to the appraisal which she felt would ""prove"" the value, my biggest sticking point.  She claimed that she was willing to lose the earnest money deposit, inspection costs and appraisal costs (~$4000) if it didn't change my mind.  That seems incredibly financially irresponsible and at very least very dishonest.  In her mind, the ends would have justified the means.  

TL;DR: Wife and I placed offer on house, offer rejected and we agreed to move on.  Wife placed counter offer for house behind my back.  "
"How do I (F 30s) tactfully discuss activities my SO (M 30s) can't enjoy due to weight?


I've been super interested in trying out some new activities lately that have a a weight limit - skydiving, zip-lining, etc, and I'm worried that my SO won't be able to join in because of his weight.    


I know his weight bothers him, but we don't really speak about it.  I don't know what his exact weight is - but I'm fairly certain it's over the weight limit for the new things I want to try.  I don't want to skip these activities, but I don't how to talk about them.  I can't imagine the embarrassment he'll face if he get told at the last minute that he's too heavy.  I also feel bad about the idea of having to talk about how much fun I had doing things that he can't share with me.  What do I do?  


TL;DR - I want to skydive, zipline etc but I don't think my SO can join me due to weight.  How do I talk to my SO about this without hurting his feelings?

"My friends [college age Fs] and I [21 F] have started skipping out on parties this one creep [20 M] in our friend group is at. It's caused a lot of drama.


My friends and I from the sport we do in college often have parties, and there's this one guy, Jon, who I recently discovered had creeped on almost all my female friends at parties. It was one of those things where it was an open secret that he was a creep, but everyone brushed it under the rug. We hadn't wanted to cause drama, and a couple guys in the had just said they'd have a talk with Jon, but he never seemed to change.

I basically got together with my girl friends and we decided not to invite Jon to any parties we throw, and also not attend parties he'd be at, as a group. We knew we couldn't get everyone to ban Jon from parties, but we could always walk out, or not let him into our own homes.

So we started just leaving him off the invite list. And when guys in the club would throw parties, we'd end up changing our plan last minute to a girls night out if we found out Jon would be there. And we'd basically tell the host why we were skipping out. Then we'd go out to my house, and drink there as a smaller group.

Anyway, it started being obvious to the whole club, which isn't that big, when 7 - 10 girls would walk out of parties, as soon as Jon walked in. Like literally almost every girl at the party would leave, it was super obvious.

That's caused a lot of drama. The club admins have stayed out of it, since they don't really get involved in stuff that happens off campus. About half the club thinks we're being passive agressive assholes, bullies, etc. And about half the club thinks Jon should stob being invited to stuff because he obviously creeped us all out enough that we'd all bail if he was there.

I feel weird because I started all this drama just trying to look out for my friends. I don't know if we should just stand firm on not wanting to go to parties this guy is at. Or if I should tell the people who think we're being rude (who I honestly don't know too well) that's not what i meant to do, I'm just looking out for my friends because I want them to not have to deal with creepy shit.

TLDR - I suggested to 10 of my friends that we skip out on parties this guy Jon goes to, after I found out he literally made all of my girl friends uncomfortable at parties. It's caused a lot more drama than I expected

"My [29M] sister [26F] is engaged to a man [30M] that once rejected/dumped my wife [29F]. Wife is upset and wants us to skip the wedding. I feel stuck in the middle.


Keeping this as short as possible. My wife and I have been together 5 years, married for 2. 

My younger sister recently announced her engagement after dating the guy for about 2 years. I've never met him and neither did my wife as we live roughly on the other side of the world. Lil sis visited us a few times but only by herself. She doesn't have any social media either so wife and I have never seen the guy. 

Anyways we got her engagement announcement and some preliminary wedding info and my wife freaked out when she saw the guy's name. Turns out the guy and my wife used to date in university. She said they were together for about 1 year before he met someone else, strung her along for a while, and then dumped her very unceremoniously in front of her friends. She was crying because she was so upset. I tried comforting her but she just got angry and kept asking very prying questions about his/my sister's relationship. I asked her if she wanted to talk to my sister directly and she said no. 

So obviously I mention this to my sister and she talks to her fiance who acknowledges that he used to date my wife but he doesn't admit to some of the events my wife said happened. He claims they mutually broke up after fizzling out but doesn't say that he had met someone else. Anyways it's been a decade and it's a complete he-said-she-said now with my sister not willing to entertain this whole thing any longer. I don't exactly blame her. 

Well now my wife is upset and wants us to ""boycott"" the wedding because she hates this guy so much. We argued over this and I told her that she doesn't have to go but I want to because I want to support my sister. She got mad at this and accused me of valuing my sister over her and refusing to acknowledge her traumatic breakup. I feel completely caught in the middle. My family all knows now and thinks my wife is crazy overreacting. Everyone expects me to go to the wedding alone at least. 

What should I do?

tldr: Wife used to date the man now marrying my younger sister. She hates him for how he broke up with her and wants us to boycott their wedding. I still want to go but I know this would upset her. Not going would upset the rest of my family. What do I do?"
"I [M 23] feel like my GF [23 F] is holding me back from getting back in the physical shape I want to be in.


Hi guys, I've been struggling with coming up with a good way to go about this issue, so i'd love to hear some feedback/ideas. My GF and I graduated college in May'17 and have been dating for about 2.5 years. We moved in together and have been living together for about 8 months. I've been active my whole life and like to go to the gym pretty often. I like going because it's a nice unwind after a day of work and I really value time to myself just listening to music and being active. The job I got after graduation has pretty long hours of just sitting in front of a computer screen, so I feel like i've been getting a little soft around the edges. Because of this, I want to really change up my diet and really commit to a health plan to help me achieve my fitness goals and get my idea body type back.

The first problem (probably easiest to tackle of the issues) has been the dieting. It's easy to do the breakfast and lunch I want because I do that on my own, but dinner gets a little tricky sometimes. My GF likes eating healthy, we just don't always have the same tastes for what those foods might be. For example, I really like chicken and want to eat a lot of it as part of stricter dieting, but she really dislikes it. When I get home from work I'm usually the one cooking, but it's hard to cook two separate meals as opposed to just finding one meal to settle on and do together. Does anyone have solutions or ways of planning dinners together so that this can turn into a win/win?

The second problem (biggest, in my opinion) is actually going to the gym. My hours are pretty steady, but my GF works hourly shifts that can change up pretty often. After sitting all day, I have a lot of built up energy and prefer to go to the gym in the evenings after a quick dinner. My GF, on the other hand, is constantly on her feet at work and is tired when she gets home. Sometimes her hours workout so that she can get to the gym before work, but some days it's hard for her to get there at all. Here's where the issue comes in: I'm perfectly fine with going to the gym on my own, but she can get very insecure about the amount of times per week she'll go to the gym vs. how often I go. If I go a couple days more than she does, it turns into an issue for her, ""am I going to the gym enough?""; ""am I getting fatter?""; ""well you went more than me"". This leads to more insecurities about how she looks. She's very thin and toned and athletic, and looks beautiful and has a great body, she just doesn't often see that in herself and it perpetuates when I go to the gym more than she does. She also struggles with some depression, so if she comes home sad or upset, I'm torn on whether to stay and try to help her or go to the gym for a quick workout then come back (if this just happened a couple times here and there, it wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't bring it up, but it happens quite often).

Another insecurity she has is that she thinks I look great and don't need to do this big of a lifestyle change. I often get the question, ""well you look great and more than good enough for me, who are you trying to impress?"", when it's really just a goal I have for myself and my self-confidence. I'm really just struggling to find a way to effectively communicate the lifestyle change I want to pursue. Again, she looks great, but because of her insecurities I feel like if I were to say, ""hey I want to really stick to a cleaner diet and consistently go to the gym X times a week to achieve this goal, do you want to do it with me?"" she would take it as I dont think she looks good enough and has gained weight (which is totally untrue). If any of you guys have gone through something similar or have any advice for me, that'd be much appreciated!

TLDR: I want to commit to a healthier lifestyle and achieve my own fitness goals, but I feel like my GF's insecurities are holding me back from fully committing. She is fit and healthy, but can have insecurities about her looks and the amount of times she workouts per week vs. how many times I do. I feel stuck and need advice on how to effectively communicate my goals while assuring her she looks great and doesn't need to go crazy with a diet/workout change like I do."
"I (25) found out i was pregnant. Boyfriend (23) of one year said he'd rather commit suicide than me have a kid, my feelings towards him have changed.


I was going to have an abortion regardless of how he reacted. I have had one in the past, and it mentally scarred me and the person I was dating at that time. After that abortion, I said I'd never have another and got an iud even though the doctor said I was also now infertile.


Fast forward - have the iud, still supposedly infertile, but am now pregnant regardless. When I broke the news to my boyfriend, his response was ""well I'm not fucking having it."" Not in a violent tone, but in a confident tone if that makes sense. I started crying harder because this was not really the response I was hoping for? I guess I was looking for more of a ""well, what would you like to do about it? I'll support you in whatever way I can."" 

But that isn't what he said. Instead, he said he'd rather commit suicide than for me to have a child. All he kept saying was how much HE did not want a kid, what am I going to do to fix this situation, etc. Just selfish things, which I felt was all unfair given the situation. Am I wrong in that? This is a huge deal to me too, and it's my body, and I'm scared, and there's no comfort?


Anyway, my feelings since that conversation have changed quite a bit. I still care about him, but I don't feel like he's who I thought he was. He isn't as supportive as I thought, etc. Do you think this feeling will go away? 


Tl;Dr am pregnant, and my boyfriend reacted terribly and so my feelings towards him have changed. What should I do to resolve this?"
"My [22M] gf [22F] bombed an internship at my brother's [35M] firm. She still expects to get an offer. How do I break it to her?


We've been dating 3 years. We've both graduated from the same university. I'm now at a grad program while she's been job hunting for 1 year now with no success. 

So my girlfriend has been looking for her first job for a while but it's been really difficult for her. She has a great degree - dual majored in engineering and economics, from a great university. She's had internships for two whole summers but no offer at the end, so she's spent this past year job searching. 

Two months ago I found a really great opportunity for her in new york. My older half-brother works in finance and he's a partner at a big hedge fund. We were at a family gathering and seeing him gave me the idea. My gf has expressed an interest in working in finance before so I thought it'd be a good fit and asked my bro if they had any openings or an internship program. He said yeah they get interns every year and to give his contact info to my gf if she's interested. Obviously she was and she was soon offered like a 2.5 month internship at their head office for the summer. It was paid, she got housing, and it seemed like the best experience she would get so far. 

Well I thought her internship was going really well with what she told me over the phone. She said she got along super well with the people there and found the work interesting and challenging. I honestly thought this was it, she found the job she wanted, and I was even thinking of moving to new york after I graduated to be with her. 

She visited me a few weeks ago and she was so happy talking about the internship and how she's certain they would make her an official offer at the end because they need her so much. So when my brother called me I was really surprised. He called me and said in very serious terms that he wanted to let me know first since we were family. He said they won't be keeping my gf on after the end of the internship. Apparently my gf was a good fit on paper with her degree and majors but she was difficult to work with. My brother said that she wasn't a hard worker and would cherry-pick the tasks she wanted to do. He said she was supposed to start off as an assistant under one of the senior portfolio managers but got under her skin because gf thought she was technologically illiterate and kept telling other people about it as a joke. The manager was like an early 50s Japanese woman who really hated my gf's attitude. She was then shuffled to 2-3 other managers but nobody wanted her and kept passing her around. 

My brother told me that my gf was obviously very smart but she needs to work on her people skills. He said she could come to him anytime for advice and things but just wanted me to know first before they broke the news to my gf. 

So now I don't know what to do. My gf would be home in 2 weeks after it ends and she gets no offer. What should I say to her? Should I tell her now or wait until she comes back? What can I do to help her?

TLDR: Gf is interning at my half-brother's finance firm and has told me she expects a full offer at the end because of her performance. Brother calls me and tells me the opposite, that she has been difficult to work with and they won't be keeping her. I don't know what to do now. Do I wait to talk to gf until she's back or do I talk to her now? Should I even say anything? Help!"
"My therapist [40sF] reschedules and cancels to the point where I [30F] can't take it anymore.


My therapist is a flake and has a bad habit of moving our sessions all around. We'll go a few weeks where she's really focused and solid, then it starts to fall apart. She'll need ""extra self care"" or need to ""set up boundaries around her health."" Often she is just too drained or tired to meet.

Here's an example of her behavior: last week, she texted me first thing in the morning to ask me to push my session an hour back. Then she pushed it another hour back at least twice to ultimately cancel. We rescheduled the session to two days later, which she also cancelled.

There have been times when I have been on the road (it's a thirty minute drive) and she has cancelled or tried to push the session back. There was also a time when her reminder text that goes out 24 hours prior reflected the wrong time, and I showed up at her office wondering where the crap she was. I had to wait an hour to be seen.

To top it all off, if I make scheduling changes, she gets incredibly snarky and has even reprimanded me for having to cancel due to BIG life events: new niece being born, moving in with my boyfriend.

Basically, I'm starting to feel like my therapist isn't mentally well enough to be a therapist. We've done some good work together when she *is* stable, to the point where I was considering scaling my sessions back to biweekly. I almost feel like she should be encouraging this at this point, but honestly I'm left feeling like she wouldn't wean me off due to money/having as many clients as possible.

I'm pretty sure I should break up with her. Is this okay to do over text message? And what should I say? Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: My therapist is a huge flake and constantly reschedules or cancels. Should I break up with her, and if so, is it okay to do it over text message?"
"I [M30], a drunk idiot, tried to tell my girlfriend how much I love her [32F]. Instead told her details about how much I liked having sex with an ex.


Last week I went out drinking with some old friends of mine I haven't seen in years. All of us were guys and as the booze was flowing, conversation turned to women, how many we'd fucked, how hot they were.  It was all pretty crass and pretty exaggerated. To my surprise I found myself pretty put off by all of it, especially since they talked about women like they weren't people and they didn't really seem to be very happy with the results of their ""slaying"".

I don't drink that often so trying to keep up with them, I was trashed, to say the least. I found my way home, somehow, and while getting in woke up my girlfriend of the last four years. I've never come home drunk like that before so I don't think she was mad about that, and after asking if I was okay seemed happy to talk with me (that I remember).

I told her what the guys had been talking about, she said that sounded gross. I agreed and said that I'd prefer a relationship like ours to getting with randoms any day of the week, and tried to tell her that I thought casual sex didn't match up to the relationship we have. That sex won't make you happy the way a longterm happy relationship would. Of course I was shitfaced so I don't think I explained that part very well (she was just nodding and asking if I had drunk any water). So I kept going and explained that I *knew* that what I was saying was right because I'd had relationships in the past with super hot women, and I wanted to have sex with them all the time. I told her about one in particular, let's call her Ashley, how the sex was just fantastic but I really didn't even really like her that much, I just stuck around for the really hot sex. And basically I just implied or outright said (I don't exactly remember because again, very drunk) that it didn't even matter to me that me and my girlfiend didn't have that because the connection we had was so great. I feel like an idiot remembering this because I felt at the time so, so affectionate for my girlfriend and thought I was being really profound. God.

After that I threw up about five times and passed out.

When I woke up my girlfriend was gone -- not unexpected, she was at work. But I also had a text message from her explaining that she was really really hurt about what I'd said, and that she didn't know what to do. That I'd gotten kind of caught up and nostalgic remembering the sex I'd had with Ashley, providing more details than she ever wanted (""Ashley would do *anything*,"" stuff like that), that I explained that it was fine if a relationship had sex that was ""just okay"" (my dumbass words).  She says she doesn't want to have sex with me for a while because she feels really unattractive and like I'm comparing her unfavorably to another woman.

She also told me not to say I didn't mean it because I obviously had. And she's right. We've never had a sex life like I've had with some of my crazy exes. It's perfectly satisfying but she has some hangups and my libido has been low for most of our relationship if I'm being honest. My girlfriend is an attractive, successful, fit woman, none of this has anything to do with her.

I told her I was sorry but she seems really distant now. I suspect I've really fucked things up. I told her that I loved her so much but she just said that ""I know you love me, you told me that you love me so much you're willing to overlook my sexual inadequecies"". I want to marry this girl and I don't want this to hurt our relationship, and I'm not sure if I just leave it alone it will get better on its own. I just don't know how to fix this either.

**TL;DR:** Got really drunk with friends, came home, and tried to explain to my girlfriend that I loved her so much I didn't even care that I'd had much better sex with some exes. She's upset and avoiding the topic now, and says sex is off the table. I'm worried about the relationship now. "
"My [f25] supervisor [m23] keeps singling me out, today he wrote me up for buying the office lunch.


Background:

I've worked at this job for little over a yr and I love it. I work in a fast pass sales environment in areas related to construction and remodeling. I am so the only girl in the office. The office has sales goals and reward when those goals are met, this seems pretty normal for numbers based offices in my experience. A common one is, if we hit our weekly number, my boss (owners son) will get lunch for the sales office the next week. Note: he only goes to his favorite restaurant and never gets enough for the whole office usually excluding 4-5 people. 

Today:
So, the office came into work today assuming we would be getting lunch as we hit the goal number last week. We were openly talking about it on Fridayand nothing was mentioned. We come in today and are told ""were not doing that anymore."" 

I can understand change in goals and rewards whatever it's a perk not an entitlement. My issue was no one was told so no one packed and not everyone in our office has the means to just go out for lunch. I decided to quietly order pizza for the office, and have it delivered. HR was informed and ok with me doing this. 

My supervisor leaves for whatever reason and the pizza is delivered at lunch. Everyone enjoys the pizza and a few say thank you. Supervisor shows back up and eats pizza.

Fast forward to the end of the day, I'm called into the office and written up for verbal contempt of management. Someone in the office turned me in for implying management was too cheap to get out lunch.

As someone who has based all self image and self worth on grade through school and now job performance (I fully recognize that this is not a great approach) I am broken. I was trying to be a team player and be kind only to be punished. It feels like I'm bring singled out  and I don't know why. I don't even want to go in today and I'm terrified I'll have to talk to my supervisor. 

How can I approach this to repair the relationship? I want to keep my job, I love what I do, but now I'm afraid to speak in the office.

TL;DR my suporvisior keeps singling me out and today wrote me up for verbal contempt of management for buying the office lunch"
"My [23F] girlfriend and I [27M] had a major falling out over a game of settlers of catan


To start with, I just want to say that there has been a lot of history between us and I don't believe this game to be the sole reason for this huge fight we had.

To cut a long story short, we were playing settlers of catan (a board game where you could think of it as a more strategic version of monopoly) with a group of friends. I got a huge advantage and proceeded to crush all the players on the board, including my girlfriend. All seemed good, then later during the night when we were alone, she brought up how selfish I was being hogging all the resources and how I could have helped her. Saying something about how I behave in a game reflects on who I am in real life and that I wouldn't hesitate to leave her behind. There was also a bit of banter during the game where she thought I was being rude, which I immediately apologised for.

After trying to assure her that in game behaviour in no way reflects what I would do in real life (as it's just a game) she refused to back down and started comparing me to another couple playing with us where the boyfriend would give his girlfriend resources every now and then.

I only really had a few options after this, agree with her and agree to co operate more, disagree with her and continue to play as i would in future games or agree to disagree and refuse to participate in any future games with her.

After failing to make her understand how I like to play games, I tried to get her to agree to disagree. She was still mad, so finally I agreed to just play games with her more co operatively. She was still really mad at me. So in the end, I left her house because she didn't want me around anymore. After that, she messaged me about how I don't care because I decided to leave rather than stay and resolve it with her (I told her several times I didn't want to leave and that I wanted to make it up with her). We havent spoken since.

Is this situation salvageable? I really don't want to play games her way and I don't believe she should be mad if I decide to abstain from board games completely to avoid conflict. But if this is the straw that breaks the camels back and she breaks up with me, then I'd reluctantly play games her way

Tl;dr girlfriend was a bit of a sore loser. Not sure how to deal with it. "
"My [25 F] boyfriend [23 M] wants to follow me on my business trips. He got suspicious of me when I said he couldn't come.


I have an engineering job that has me traveling a lot for work. I work on designing railways for airports, like those trains that take you around within larger airports. A lot of our projects are in other countries.

When traveling for work, I usually don't have to work nights and weekends; we work on the customer's schedule and most customers keep pretty normal hours. So I've been able to see cities all over the world. 

It's really amazing being able to do all this, with my flights and hotels and food paid for. 

It is still work though, I work hard on those trips, and taking long flights gets to be a pain.

I've been in a relationship with Todd since college, for about 5 years.

After a few times of coming home and telling Todd about my work trips, he mentioned he'd want to join me for some of them. 

I said no way, I'm busy working most of the time, and the fun stuff I'd talked about doing is just stuff I can squeeze into weekends and nights. But it's not a vacation. Plus my company is only paying my way, he'd have to pay for his own transportation and food.

He said he'd be fine paying for his half, and he'd find stuff to do during the workdays. And when I was off for the weekend, we could do stuff together.

I said it still wasn't OK, it's tough being respected sometimes as the only female engineer on my team, and I would look ridiculous, bringing my boyfriend on a business trip.

Todd got really upset about that, he asked why I'd have a reason to hide the fact that I had a boyfriend from the men I work with.

I said it wasn't like that, but he didn't believe me.

TLDR - My boyfriend wants to come with me when I travel for business."
"How do I (30sF) keep up a relationship with my close friend (30sF) after her husband (30sM) almost killed me?


(All names and a few irrelevant details have been changed.)   


A short introduction:  

I have been friends with Katie for over 20 years, and she is one of my closest friends. When she got married to Ben, I was her MOH. I am the godmother of one of their kids. Ten years ago, I bought a decent 2000 Honda which I still drive. 

Ben is a mechanic, specialized in Hondas. Over the years, he bought a bunch of broken cars that he repaired and then sold. My best friend Lucy bought a car from him, and later learned that the cable layout was a mess when she took it to her work shop.  We talked to Ben, and he said: ""Sorry, I must have missed it."" We weren't thrilled, but it wasn't too concerning, mistakes happen. 

What happened:

In March, I took my car to Ben's work shop because I had trouble shifting, and I wanted my car to be serviced. I paid roughly $400 to Ben for new brakes, the work, and service (oil and brake fluid were replaced etc.). He said he couldn't find out the reason why I had trouble shifting. 

In May, I went to a workshop next to my parents' house to get my tires changed (I didn't have time to do it myself this time and the tires are stored at my parents garage). This repair shop found out that my car's release bearing was broken, a ""pretty standard thing"" given my car's mileage. They recommended I should replace the clutch entirely because typically other parts could be close to breaking, too, and the price would not be significantly higher ($50 difference). They also said I could continue to drive, but they didn't recommend I drive more than 500 miles with a broken clutch. I drove home and made an appointment with a repair shop next to my place (because it was cheap, convenient and had decent ratings). 

The mechanic was really, really nice, and checked my car completely as soon as I got into that place. He showed me that there was oil all over engine. He showed me that the brake in the back didn't appear to work properly (and explained why). He took roughly 45 minutes to explain technical stuff to me. He said it's completely up to me if I wanted to get repairs at his place or elsewhere, or when. He just recommended I get things checked out. I see when someone is honest vs. trying to upsell, and this was definitely not a case of upselling.  I signed for the repairs (I had gotten quotes from other places, and this was more than fair) and left the car. 

Yesterday, I got a call from him. He told me there was no brake pad left in the back, and that my brakes were fractured into three pieces. Within the next 50-100 miles my brakes would have broken in a way that would have likely killed me. He kept the broken parts and showed me. He also indicated that ""the mechanic who serviced the car must have realized something was wrong, because he adjusted the brakes (in a way that is only done when something is wrong, which means the brakes have to be checked)"". So Ben was negligent/stupid/mean enough to potentially kill me. I paid for the service, but obviously it wasn't done. 

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* I paid my close friend's husband, who is a mechanic, to service my car and change the brakes. He didn't. Out of pure luck, I had something else done at a different work shop, and they realized my brakes were about to fail within the next 50 miles, likely ending in a fatal accident. 

I haven't talked to Ben or Katie yet. Also, I don't need legal advice, so please don't say I should take this to court. I'm only looking for  relationship advice.

How do I go from here? "
"I (34F) am puzzled by my husband’s (34M) reaction after a car accident


I have been with my husband for 14 years and married most of them.

Financially we are doing fine. We have a nest egg and we pay our credit cards off each month. 

We were in a car accident and I was on the passengers side where the impact was. We were out of town but I felt like I should go to the doctor because something was definitely wrong with my neck. My husband discouraged me from going but finally I just said I was going and took an uber. 

At the quick care clinic they saw something weird on my x-ray and wanted to transfer me to the ER with a neck brace. I took another uber to the ER. My husband did come to the ER eventually and it turned out they read the x-ray wrong and my bones were fine, I just had a sprained neck. 

I have been dealing with neck pain for a month now. I thought it would go away by now but it hasn’t and it hurts. I was supposed to follow up with my doctor anyway so I made an appointment. My husband discouraged this too. 

My doctor prescribed some medicine and physical therapy. When I told my husband about the physical therapy I could tell by his face that he wasn’t happy. 

He said it will cost a fortune but he doesn’t know that. The ER visit was 11,000 but our portion was only $100. We have really good insurance. I offered to call the insurance company to see how much they would cover but he blew that off. 

He told me that he has discomfort sometimes too and he just lives with it. He says if I give it enough time it will go away. 

I don’t understand why he is acting like this. They will probably say the accident was our fault so we are out $500 for our deductible. I don’t think they will cover my medical bills but I planned to call and see. Even then the bills are small in my opinion. It isn’t putting us into financial hardship. 

I would think he would be concerned with my wellbeing because he has seen me when I get the stabbing pain. He listens to me complain about my neck hurting every day. 

What’s the deal? 

Tldr: I was in a car accident and got a sprained neck. My husband doesn’t want me to get medical treatment. "
