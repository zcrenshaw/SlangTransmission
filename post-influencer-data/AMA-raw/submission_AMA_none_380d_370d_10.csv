1,"As of right now, I am wide awake lying next my girlfriend whom I just found out, has been cheating on me for several months. AMA.


We have been together for 2 years and our parents love us both. We are in talks of marriage. We are of different nationalities but the distance is close enough for me to fly in and out every 2 weeks to vist her or so. I am supporting her financially as well.

Out of the blue I decided to look through her messages and found out shes been fucking another man for the past few months whenever I am away and without my knowledge. The other man does not know of my existance. From the messages i read, she's been manipulating the both us. They have established a bf/gf r/s as well. 

I have been spending so much time with her family and they treat me as their own son.. and at this very moment, her parents are sleeping next room and she's fast asleep next to me. 

My stomach is sick as fuck and I wanna cry. I am having a little problem breathing and am so fucking lost."

5,"I died for 14 mins........ AMA?????


This may be long? I’m kinda writing as i go here but I’ll try and tell this personal account as best as I can. 

It was the night of February 15th 2018. At the time I was in a program called “Job Corps.” Which is a residential career training center for peeps ages 16-24. There are several (7) dorms on campus, events for students etc. On that night they had a “valentine day dance” that I attended with some friends. It was actually one of the first “parties” that I had a good time at. The first time shy little old me danced too! Which surprised a lot of people lol. Anyways. The dance was from 6pm-9:30pm 

(center wide curfew is at 9:50. You have to be in your dorms, in your room at that time.)I walk up to my room at about 9:45 and lay down. About 5 minutes into laying down, my stomach started hurting. So I head over to the bathroom. I was taking a poop (sorry) when suddenly I felt (what I thought was) an asthma attack coming. I have had asthma my whole life. Thousands of asthma attacks. Needless to say.... I wasn’t worried at all. I decided to quickly get up from the toilet and get my inhaler from my room. I do so, and take the inhaler back to the restroom stalls with me and take it there. I sit there for 2 minutes waiting for the puffs to take effect. But fuck. Every other time it was immediate. So I start to get worried. My breathing abilities are declining fast. I then knew, this was an emergency. 

I immediately stopped what I was doing an ran to my RA’s office. Completely unable to get a single ounce of oxygen in my lungs. (Zero exaggeration there.) I couldn’t talk, but my RA immediately knew what was wrong. I was flashing my inhaler at him. My RA called out on the centerwide radio system “dorm emergency” which ALL staff members respond to. This is where things get fuzzy. 

I have been absolutely breathless for over a minute and a half. My body senses are at their highest ability. I remember ever smell, every sight, ever sound, every damn feeling I was feeling from this point on. Everything around me was tunnel vision. I gained enough energy to say three words “I’m going to die.” I knew I was going to die. There was no fucking doubt about it. Everything around me was chaotic but I felt so peaceful. A security guard walked in the room and said “mr.mcallister (my last name) and smiled at me to keep my comfortable. I was beyond comfortable.

3 minutes without a single breath. Everything started fading to black. I can here commotion, but I remember so many voices talking I couldn’t zone out on one conversation. I felt the warmest feeling in my body. I had accepted death. I felt so fucking happy it’s unbelievable. That’s when everything went to black. The last thing I heard at that very moment was “they’re 2 minutes away” I didn’t care lol. The last thing I felt: What felt like 3 seconds after I heard that, (really was 2 minutes later) I feel my eyelid open and a flashlight shine into them. Then, boom! Blackness again. 

When I say blackness... I mean blackness. Imagine the deepest sleep you can induce yourself in. No dreams, no awareness... just nothing. That’s what I mean by blackness. Idk how long it felt like... but it was 14 minutes later when I woke up with tubes down my throat, probably like 5 Iv’s I was hooked up to an AED machine (delivers shock to your heart when it stops) and 12+ doctors giving me cares. That was when I felt true terror into what had just occurred. It was about 10:30 pm the same night. I remember slowly waking up. And remembering everything. That was the single most scariest moment of my life.... was in ICU for three days, but I was totally fine as soon as I woke back up.

According to my full medical records for that night which I obtained by requesting it lol, I was deceased for 14 mins and suffered from sudden respiratory failure. That was my story. I’m still having bad flashbacks multiple times a day (it’s only been 6 months) but yeah! AMA!!


Ps- yes, when I was dead, I ended up taking that poop in my pants if anybody was interested lmfao."

7,"I'm an immunologist and our lab has cracked the human ""sugar code"" (featured on LA Times, CNBC)! AMA


I'm Dr. Emanual Maverakis from UC Davis, and our lab just published an article in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/cracking-the-sugar-code-why-the-glycome-is-the-next-big-thing-in-health-and-medicine-97750) about how glycans are the next big thing in medicine. Glycans are one of four essential macromolecules of the body - along with DNA, protein, and fats. Most of us are familiar with the 2003 Human Genomic Project, which mapped all of the genes in our bodies. We have replicated the effort with glycans - complex sugar molecules that modify how cells in our body behave. Glycans play a huge role in our immune cells, and impact the course of diseases like cancer, autoimmune diseases (where the body attacks itself), and even aging! 

&amp;#x200B;

We are going to publish our paper soon, but please check out our (easy to understand!) article in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/cracking-the-sugar-code-why-the-glycome-is-the-next-big-thing-in-health-and-medicine-97750) as a teaser. Our lab has worked tirelessly for YEARS on this gargantuan project, and I'm so proud to see it finally come to fruition. So much of biomedical/health funding is dictated by public interest, so please please share if you find this research compelling and important! We believe this project will be groundbreaking in medicine, as it will help us better understand and one day treat human diseases.

8,"I (19F) recently found out my dad was diagnosed with MPD, was a sociopath, and lied about his identity for my entire life, including telling me he was shot down in the Vietnam War, etc. AMA


Up until very recently, I knew my father to be one of the most honest and loving people I had the privilege of knowing in my life. 

My family recognized him as a hero in his own right; a great warrior, since he had been sent to Vietnam in his early 20s and was able to make it back with incredible stories to tell. When I was a young girl, I would ask him to retell them to me, as if his experiences in war were my bedtime stories. He told me he was in the Navy, flew F-14s over Vietnam and was subsequently shot down. His gunman behind him was killed by ground shots. He ejected, landed in a tree, and one of his war buddies saved his life by cutting him down and dragging him through the jungle for 3 days straight. There was a scar on my dad’s upper leg which marked his injuries from the fall, making the story even more thrilling for my restless child mind. I played with little war figurines, learned the names of all the planes and helicopters. There were photographs of him in his flight suit, of him in F-14s, and he even had a naval uniform in his closet that I truly admired. There were trinkets, badges, dog tags, the real deal. He was my inspiration.

My father passed away suddenly from an aortic aneurysm at age 65 near the beginning of my freshman year of uni. My dad had previously married and produced 3 children, who are my two stepbrothers and stepsister. I have known about them but don’t really communicate (they are much older). When my mom and I were going through the motions, we reminisced of his Vietnam stories and spoke of holding a military funeral to my siblings, who were completely dumbfounded by what we shared. This was when I knew something was wrong. My stepbrother pulled my mother aside and had to tell her that my father was never in the military. There was no record of him enlisted, no discharge forms, and wasn’t a member of the VA. My mom and I rummaged through all of his things and found out that all of the memorabilia was fake. Every photo, every memory, every story. It was absolutely horrifying to not know, in that moment, who my father was.

One particularly striking memory I have of my father is when we travelled to Washington, D.C. last summer. He requested to visit the Vietnam Memorial to find the name of his gunman partner that had ‘died in combat’ with him. I remember him walking down to find one man’s name, looked into the obsidian wall it was carved into, and cried. He cried over a dead man, yes, but it’s odd to think my father would cry over a man he never truly knew.

I have plenty more to share, but I’ll keep this relatively brief. So, AMA."
