1,"I'm straight... but there's this guy...


So I'm 19 and consider myself straight. But I met this gay guy at school (age 20) and we really got on. We made fast buddies and I admit I did strangely find him attractive. He's taller than me, lean, thick dark hair, and super- blue eyes. The first hint that something was up was when we were in the locker room at the campus gym and I saw him naked. It totally turned me on. Fortunately, I had my pants on because there was definitely an erection. So some time goes by and we hang out (and yeah, in between I did jerk off imagining him). Then one night about a few months ago I was over at his apartment and we were watching a movie. We were sitting pretty close together and I felt inclined to hold his hand so I reached over and took it. He didn't even seem surprised, though I did notice a smirk on his face. Anyway, he didn't pull away and we just sat there holding hands for awhile. Then we sort of glanced at each other, and he leaned forward and kissed me. Then I kissed him back and we made out on his couch (at some point we were even lying down, him on top of me, and that got me even more turned on). He led me by the hand to his bedroom, we took each other's clothes off, and had sex (everything short of anal since I was not prepared for that in more ways than one). And I was confused but pretty happy, and it was honestly better than any sex I've ever had with a girl (though my experience in that arena is rather limited). I ended up spending the night with him. From that point on, our interactions changed. When greeting each other, we kiss, I spend a few nights a week at his place. His parents invited me over for dinner last week. My roommate (who is also gay) walked in to our apartment once and found me with my head in his lap and him stroking my hair. Afterwards, my roommate referred to him as my boyfriend, and I had to correct him, because again, I'm straight, but I feel strongly connected with him and enjoy spending time close to him. But then last night my sister asked how things were going with my boyfriend. She said it jokingly, but it's starting to make me self- conscious. Am I misinterpreting this relationship, and we're more than just close buddies who periodically have fun? Is it possible I'm not straight, or do no other straight guys feel comfortable doing stuff like this? Any advice?   "
2,"Gaybros, how do I get a boyfriend like the guy from Primitive Technology on Youtube. Do they make men like that in gay?

4,"Never let being femme hold you back


I see a lot of worry, confusion, praise, and slander posted about being femme in this sub, and I just wanted to share my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was doing my undergrad, I was femme. Not mildly femme, full-blown-flamer femme. I wore make up, flatironed my hair, wore mostly women's pants (because they made my ass look amazing), and flounced my merry way through life. I never hid myself at University, and being in a smaller town there were some challenges, but by and large I was out, loud, and fucking proud. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point during my third year, I had applied for a very competitive position in a Physics lab. There were two spots, and annually about 300 applicants, so you had to be on your A-game during the application process. I had made it past the first round (a paper test), and was granted an interview. I was going to just wear plain boring-ass, normal, bro clothes to the interview because even with all of my confidence, I understood that I was applying to a board of old, stodgy, mostly male scientists. I was so thrilled to be given the interview, it was all I could think about. 

&amp;#x200B;

One week before the interview I was flipping through my agenda (before smart phones were popular), and nearly lost my shit when I realized the interview was THAT DAY, NOT in one week as I had assumed; I had fucked up the date. I was heart broken because I was in full-flamer clothing (unfunctionally thin scarf and all) and realized I didn't have time to go home and change. So my options were: ditch the interview, or just go in there and try my fucking hardest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitch doesn't quit. Bitch has NEVER quit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I reviewed my notes as quickly as I could, and marched my ass to the Faculty of Science's office and had my interview. Flat-ironed hair, full make up, femme clothing and all. I presented to three of the oldest, most conservative men that I could possibly imagine, and then left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, because I'm writing this, I got the position. And that was the most eye-opening experience I could have ever had. The most brilliant, perfect, ultimate, realization I could have ever dreamed of magicking into creation: No one gives a fuck if you're femme, as long as you're competent. The board could have easily dismissed me if I APPEARED TO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, not because of what I looked like. That's when I realized that yes, I will encounter homophobia, but to combat it, all I have to do is be my damn best self, outshine the normalized competition, show that my opinion did have value, and that my personhood was not dependent on what the fuck I looked like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I toned down the make-up, hair, and clothing as my 20s progressed, mostly because my style changed, but the flaming aspect of my personality is still VERY much there. I teach in the Physics department  of the largest university in my country, and have never felt held back for being femme. 

&amp;#x200B;

Femmes of AskGayBros, do not let something as menial and inconsequential as what you look like hold you back, out perform the competition, be the most competent in the room, Shine Bright like a fucking diamond! "
5,"I hate my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù

6,"Is anyone else ready for domestic bliss?


I just want to settle down, have someone to come home to everyday after work, talk about our days, make dinner together, cuddle and watch some Netflix on the couch, and fall asleep in each other's arms. I can't wait for everyday activities to become special because I get to spend time with my favorite person in the world. "
7,"UPDATE: Panicked during my first ever Grindr hookup


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/99526z/panicked_during_my_first_ever_grindr_hookup/)

&amp;#x200B;

So I ended up unblocking him on Grindr when I got home and I told him about what happened and how I was too nervous and I panicked. He was really understanding and told me if I ever wanted to come over again that we could take things slower. So last night I took him up on that offer and I went over to his place again. He started with just putting on a movie and we just cuddled and talked on his couch for a bit. After about 30ish minutes of just cuddling and talking I finally got comfortable and my nerves calmed down. I turned around (I was the little spoon) and we started kissing/making out. One thing led to another and we ended up giving each other bjs. He even asked me if I wanted to top him but I told him I wasn't ready for that just yet. The whole time he was making sure that I was comfortable with everything and it was really nice. When we finished we just went back to cuddling (except he was shirtless at this point) and we finished the movie. We said our goodbyes and I actually went home feeling like I was on top of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say thank you to everyone who gave me real advice on my original post it all helped a lot. I learned that when I go into a hookup like this I just need to relax and communicate more with my partner and I'll end up having a good time. I don't think I would've met up with this guy again and have had this good experience if it wasn't for you guys!

Thank you AGB!"
8,"My Muslim mom made me cry, again, but this time, they are tears of happiness.


So she knew I've been drinking and eating pork and that I'm gay. I wanted her to know. I put it on IG. Because I feel like I don't want to hide anymore.

So we had a big fight because in a conservative Muslim family this is a big deal and my whole family attacked and attacked me but somehow she warmed up to me again I don't know why... She just said she still loves me no matter what and she feels like I would be there for her when she's old and frail.

And I was like yes I would and I held her soft aged hand in mine and pressed her little fingers and went into my room and cried.

It was like she briefly put aside religion and saw that I have always loved her so much. "
9,"Gays who prefer kissing and cuddling to sex


I really don't like sex. Never gave any kind of pleasure but pain and disgust. But I love kissing and cuddling. I could spend hours just making out. But then the sex part just makes my skin crawl. Have you guys ever felt the same way? "
10,"Y‚Äôall, get tested


I‚Äôm 24 and, while I‚Äôve gotten tested over the years for every other disease, I was always too afraid to get tested for HIV. 

It took me having unprotected sex with someone who ended up having gonorrea for me to finally get over the anxiety to go to the doctor. I got tested for actually everything.

Today I got a negative for everything. I‚Äôve been really lucky. But today waiting for my results I thought to myself: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had good enough sex that was worth having HIV. No sex is worth that risk. Why have I been so afraid to get tested?‚Äù

Anyways, reminder to get tested regularly. I‚Äôm going to start, and I‚Äôm going to wear a condom every single time now unless I find someone I want to settle down with. "
11,"Hey gaybros


No matter how big or small you think your problem is, I hope you get through it and feel happiness. Know that you‚Äôre loved, at least from me :) "
12,"Personal victory - hot guys don't make me feel like shit anymore.


Last year I was 320lbs, had a shitty personal hygiene routine, crappy clothes, and no friends.  I was dealing with so much difficult shit internally, between my crippling depression and PTSD, my family's mounting money problems, and generally feeling like I didn't have a place in the world.  I tried hooking up with a few guys, couldn't get off, and thought my life would just be shit.  

All of my life, but especially after my first few attempts at sex didn't work out the way I planned, I would get really bent out of shape when I saw a hot guy.  My thoughts basically went two ways - (1) that I was gross and he'd never find me attractive, and (2) that I wanted to look like him so bad, but it was simply impossible, and his life was going to be better than mine so I'd better just accept it.

Everything changed when I was meeting with my therapist, talking ad nauseam *again* about how I wish I looked better (thinking my life would vastly improve), and she said ""you know, maybe you won't lose weight, and there isn't anything wrong with that.""  I still can't articulate what went through my mind and body when I heard those words.  For years I'd been living with the idea that I'd lose weight and get fit someday, and then I'd enjoy my life.  Until then I was just doing my best.  It never occurred to me that it might never happen until that moment, and it was one of the scariest feelings I've ever experienced.

I decided to make a change a bit less than a year ago - because my therapist's comment showed me that nothing was going to happen if I didn't do anything.  Now I'm 195lbs and working on bulking.  My entire life is different.  I went from a 44 to a 36 in pants and still going down.  I even went from a 15W to a 14W in shoes - crazy!

I work in a job where I have to talk to university students all the time.  Some of these guys are just gorgeous - we have a lot of student athletes and military/veteran students.  I used to feel so intimidated when a good looking guy needed help, and it was a real impediment to my job.  Being on campus during the beginning of the Fall semester, when they'd all wear their shorts and tank tops around, was unbearable.  Until now.  I smile more - they smile at me.  I'm so much more confident, and when a good looking guy needs help, I'm totally down - because I get to help someone, and enjoy how they look for a little while.  Lol  

Ultimately I had issues with myself and felt I wasn't good enough.  Now I know I'm just as good as everyone else - even the hot guys.  And the kicker is that I always was, I only just realized.  

Fitness/weight loss transformations are much more inward than they are outward, and it's just amazing.

It's a real personal victory for me to walk around campus like I belong there, and enjoy the hot guys rather than shame myself for noticing.  Guys and gals also look at me now, which is a really new experience!

I'm so proud, just had to share!"
13,"Never enter a relationship lying about you being monogamous.


If you sell yourself as monogamous, FFS live that life and stop going around searching for ‚Äúreal‚Äù monogamous people who think you value and respect them just like they do you only for you to end up ruining them once your lies and deceit unfold.

If you‚Äôre into poly, FFS say so.

If you‚Äôre not into monogamy, FFS say so.

If you still don‚Äôt know what you want in life and want to continue fucking around them FMFS, SAY SO.

Don‚Äôt drag us into your shit. We deserve better than being treated like options. This world is already corrupted enough. Don‚Äôt be one of the people who trick monogamous ones into a relationship with them when all they do in the backstage is fuck around when no one‚Äôs looking."
14,"Turned down an offer to play bass for a black metal band after the guitarist/Vox turned out to be a homophobe.


Not asking for advice, I'm just venting and wanted to share.

So I'm at work and minding my own business doing work shit, when this guy in an old school fuckin Emporer shirt wanders into my store. He catches my eye as most metal heads do. And I check out the goods. He was alright looking, but not quite what I'm looking for right now.  

He gets a 6 pack of bud light. Which I could forgive, some people like alcohol in their water, that's fine. A lack of smokes and a candy bar. 
So to break the ice I said, i haven't seen that shirt in a long damn time dude. 
He chuckles and says, yeah? You into black metal? 
I say, I am and he goes on to say, that he's been trying to start a band for awhile but hasn't had any luck. I asked him what he's missing and he told me a second guitarist and a bassist. It's always a bassist. Especially with metal. We're rare I guess. 
I tell him, I'm a bass player and his eyes light up for second then he gets serious. 
He asks me how long I've been playing. 16 years. Trained or self taught? Self taught. Can you read music. A little, but I'm not great at it. 
I was honest with the guy.

He then goes on to ask if I know any guitar players, which I do and I drop a name of a guy I know pretty well from the scene that plays pretty good. He says no, not that guy. Anyone else?
That caught me off guard, the guy I mentioned is a solid fucking guitarist and a good guy all around. So I ask what's wrong with him?
He's gay, the guy tells me.
So? Is that a problem? I ask, and I'm starting to get a familiar feeling. I'm gonna hit this mutha fucker. 
Well, yeah. I can't be hanging out and partying with fags man. They'll make shit weird. If we start doing gigs he'll attract other fags to our shows and then we'll be another fag band with faggot band mates. That's not the vision I have for my band. 

Okay, I see what you're saying. Except none of what you said has anything to do with music. You're talking about partying and hanging out and shit. He could tell my demeanor changed from one of interest to something more suspicious. You do know there's a lot of gay metal heads right? Chances are a decent majority of fans you would have around here would be gay if you started making a name right?

Nah man, all of my friends are straight. We don't do none of that queer emo shit. He said and he was really defensive and that had nothing to do with what I said. 

You do realize that Emporer is one of the band's that started off with the corpse paint and the brooding in the forest black and white photos right? That's some pretty emo shit dude. Metal in and of itself has a message to convey that's political, emotional, and thought provoking most of the time. Regardless of its inherent shock factor. There's always some deeper meaning to it. So you're saying that's queer?

Nah man, fags are queers and they don't have a place at a metal show.
Okay man, good luck finding anybody to be in a band with that kind of hateful perspective. Forget I mentioned my friend and forget I said anything about it. 

What are you a fag or something too? He said next and I had to clench the fuck out of my fist. 
Or something, I said. Have a good night homophobe. That'll be $23.67. Did I forget to card you? I did, can I see some ID?

It's out in my van man. 
Of course you'd drive a van. Well go get it and then we can finish this transaction. I suspended the transaction and took his shit and put it on a counter behind me and he left. He didn't come back in for his hard water or his other shit. 

As I said. I'm not looking for advice or anything. I'm just venting my frustration that even here the third most accepting city in this fucked up country could still be so backwards. Guess that's why it's only ranked third.

15,"Update: just informed my ex-roommate is a ""gay incel"" that wants to hurt me, do I go to the police?


its been a tough day today but I went to the police and my schools administration.

  
The cops said theyre going to look into it and possibly help me with a restraining order. the school is taking it pretty seriously and raising the issue to the senate because its sexual assault related. I guess since theres been a spike in rapes across schools theyre being pretty careful. he has now deleted his accounts and its denying EVERYTHING because the police did contact him saying he needs to talk to them. I put all the evidence I have on flash drives and gave it to the cops and school so we'll see how it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

He frantically sent me like 100 messages on grindr (I guess he got it today to try to contact me) talking about how it was all a joke but also switched to saying shit like how ""its over for me"" and how I'm lucky the cops got to him quick like.... wtf I think this all scared him a lot though so even if nothing happens he will probably stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

thanks to everyone yesterday for helping me build up the guts to deal with this. cheers!"
