0,"I'm watching proof of my boyfriend cheating in real time


We have a shared tablet that's kept on most of the time for Netflix or checking recipes from the kitchen. He was out with friends last night, I didn't ask, and stayed in and went to bed early.

In the morning I'm using the computer to check my email and his Google credentials are logged in and his Gchat icon is active. He's at work now likely using it from his phone. He's now actively chatting with a man he's been fucking for at least 2 weeks now, except they're killing time by going into graphic detail about their last hookup which was apparently last night.

The messages are still rolling in, and he doesn't get off work until 7 tonight.

5 years together."
1,"Update: I'm watching proof of my boyfriend cheating in real time


[Original post linked here](https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/8vcage/im_watching_proof_of_my_boyfriend_cheating_in/)

The past week hasn't been good, and to everyone who's reached out to me either in the thread in the original post or through my messages, I appreciate it. Truth be told, ever since I found out this was happening, I feel like I've been dissociating a little, and the drinking hasn't helped that.

When I found out what was going on, I didn't really know how to handle it so I shut down mentally. I managed to get back to work on Thursday, but had to leave early because of a potential month-to-month rental agreement I needed to sign. Until then, I stayed the first night in a hotel, and the rest back in the apartment.

During this time, I tried to approach this as clinically as I could since I already knew my answer, the relationship was over. I took at least 20 screenshots of the chatlog, mostly for emphasis, attached them to a word document along with a copy of our lease where the front office highlighted where he will need to sign and date to end the lease. Yes, I told the office after I found out, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to end it with a partial payment to close out the remaining 3 month term.

Before he got home last night, I had already packed 3 suitcases worth of essentials to move in to the new unit, and planned for a moving truck to come Saturday. I stored these in the closet overnight. My office already knew I would be coming in late this morning.

This morning, I got dressed as usual while he was showering and sat down on a kitchen table chair with my bags. It took a lot to maintain my composure, I was too nervous to be sad then, but I know I looked visibly anxious. When he finally came in, I tried to make it as cut-and-dry as possible.

1). I know about the guy you've been fucking around with

2). Here is the proof

3). It's bullshit that you had to force my hand on this, but it's over. Period.

4). Here's where to sign to get out of the lease

5). When you come home tonight I won't be here.

And I left. He half-heartedly followed me to the door trying to get me to ""talk about this"", but I kept walking, closed it, and took an Uber to my new room.

I'm typing this from my new room with a very Spartan set-up (at least until the moving truck claims the rest tomorrow), but it's mine. I've gotten a small flurry of texts from him but it feels like a PR move more than anything. He wants to act like he cares, just the appearance of it.

I still feel like I've dissociated from the situation. A few messages I've gotten said that soldiering through this is the best course of action in the long-run, and I hope my outcome will be as good as yours was. However, I still feel a lot of shame. The recognition that somehow I wasn't able to either maintain this relationship, or be the type of person he would want to stay with.

Until then, my desire to get back into a relationship is gone. In a way it's calming. But this is still just Day 1.

TL;DR: I ended it, and a moving truck is all that's left before he's no longer a part of my life"
2,"The next step after ""boipussy"" and ""bussy"". Please don't say this.


Had a hookup refer to his hole as if it was a girl. 


Like, he went ""Yeah you wanna strech her out? She's ready! Fuck her!"" as i was fingering him. 


I was like... Wat.. My dick went limp real quick, please don't do this. HUGE turnoff. I had to make the guy leave. "
3,"Did I get raped?


I met up with a guy on Grindr for fun (I was consenting to having sex) he said he forgot a condom and it made me uncomfortable, but I just went with it. This is where it gets bad, he had a 7inch dick and just jammed it up my ass really fast it hurt so bad! I tried to push him off and screamed in pain but he just pulled my arms behind my back and started going deeper. It was honestly the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. He was intentionally putting his dick as deep inside me as he could even tho I was begging him to stop. I was crying but he kept going, my ass bled because of how unprepared I was for his dick he put me in a rear naked choke and came in me then got dressed and kicked me out of his car... 
I feel like shit "
4,"Being rejected by a straight boy has actually made me really confident..


This might sound odd but today I got rejected by a straight boy and it's weirdly made me feel so confident in myself. 

A couple days ago I went to a bar with a friend and there was this absolutely amazing boy waiting tables. Literally exactly my type and watching him practically night walk around serving people made me fall for him a little. I ended up leaving the bar really regretting not having talked to him. I'm pretty introverted and just talking to someone is difficult. 

Today my friend and I went back, to be honest, by this point I had actually kind of forgotten about him, but as we walk in we're greeted by his friendly smile and brought to our table. Oh my gosh... he's sooo fucking cute!

I decided I was going to talk to him and ask him out. After a drink, I stood up as he walked by and just said ""Sorry.. this might seem a bit odd, but are you gay by any chance?"".. he gave me a big smile, touched my arm (which seemed a bit weird lol) and politely said ""sorry, I'm not! but I appreciate it :)"". 

It didn't suck.. at all! Sure, I would have loved it if he had said yes, but I feel so much better a) knowing that he isn't gay and b) knowing that being rejected isn't actually a big deal. Like.. fuck, this is what I've been worried about??

I guess the moral of this story is, ask out the cute guy you've been eyeing up.. maybe they'll say no, but honestly who gives a shit?"
5,"Update: I think my boyfriend is cheating


It was all true, all my suspicions. He's been having an affair with a guy for nearly three months. He confessed after I confronted him, showed me everything and said it was only one guy. They have been sending each other nudes, sexts, they have been meeting up every single week got to hook up. I'm so fucking heartbroken. I have been trying so hard even when he was pushing me away. I'm mad that he put me in danger by having sex with him without a condom and he still thinks we can work it out. Sorry for the rant. "
6,"Do you ever have the sudden realization that you're gay and it shocks you a little?


What I mean by this is that you are obviously aware of the fact you are gay and open about it, but you don't really pay much mind to it all. Then, say you're watching a movie and notice an attractive guy and think ""Man, I'd love to fuck him"". Then you suddenly become shocked as it just reminded you of your sexuality as you  never really thought about it much. Or you'll see or hear people talking about gays and think: ""They're talking about me in a way"" and it feels kind of surreal. And pretty much anything else that suddenly gives you a reminder of what you are."
7,"Bi husband is involved with a woman.


I'm a gay guy in my late 20s married to a guy in his mid 40s who identifies as bi. He was married to a woman before me and has a child. Weve been married for 4 years and everythings been pretty good. A couple weeks ago he told me that he was involved with a woman he met through his work. This was absolutely devastating for me but I was able to work through it for the past few weeks with his promise that it wouldn't happen again. Recently he told me that he wants to open up our marriage so that he can see women sexually to fulfill that part of his sexuality but doesn't want me to sleep with anyone else, this is pretty rough for me to hear and at this point it looks like if I don't allow him this he will leave me. I'm embarrassed to admit on here but I haven't been working since we started dating and rely on him financially, I don't know how easy it will be for me to get back into the corporate world with a 6 year gap in my resume at my age. How can I fix this? Does anyone have experience with open relationships like this?

Edit: we have a prenup that says if he cheats I get yearly spousal support which would generously cover my rent and car so I would have time to get back on my feet. however I don't actually want to leave him, I was imagining kids and shit with him but all that's coming down on me now :("
8,"Boyfriend becoming more feminine, losing attraction to him


When we met I would say my boyfriend was a pretty healthy mix of feminine and masculine, similar to me. Between the two of us he's more comfortable with his feminine side than I am, which I've learned to appreciate about him. He's made me more comfortable with my sexuality and it still amazes me how fearless and open he is with his own.   


But as we've gotten more comfortable in a long term relationship, he's started to act more feminine than is sexually attractive to me. If he were a friend I'd be 100&amp;#37; supportive but I have no control over what turns me on- And in this case, what turns me off. I was just about to send him some steamy texts and he messaged me about buying butt pads to do drag. My arousal has never died so fucking fast.   


We have a very healthy relationship otherwise, and it's definitely not enough to break up over. I don't want him to change who he is, but I can't help that it affects how I see him sexually. I feel like the world's biggest asshole and I don't know how to be supportive. I have no idea how to even let him know how I'm feeling without hurting him, but just swallowing my feelings and letting my attraction to him wither away without even telling him what's happening doesn't seem right either.

Want to emphasize I'm not anti-femme. I'm not really into hyper masculine guys either. I like a balance. If there was enough masculinity to balance out this new femininity it would be a nonissue.  And that's only in partners for sexual compatibility's sake. When it comes to friends I'm open to all kinds.

Was hoping for advice from others, I really don't know a lot of LGBT people to ask for advice. "
9,"Hoooolly FUCK bottoming is so good


Feeling him thrust his cock in, out, in, out. Hitting my prostate. Wrapping my legs around him in missionary. Feeling his breathing get faster and his thrusts deeper. Gripping me tightly when he cums inside me. Feeling his balls spank my ass on every thrust. Fuck now i'm horny again."
10,"So my boyfriend just told me he's transgender


and I'm honestly not sure what to do. I really, truly love this man(?), so of course I want to stay with him, but he has plans to go through with sex-reassignment surgery, so I'm not sure if I'll still be attracted to him or what afterwards. I have many fears and doubts about the future. It probably makes me sound a bit shallow saying that I'm having doubts just because he wants to change his body, but I feel like it's a legitimate concern. What would y'all do, and what do you think I should do? "
11,"The boy I like likes me back and it feels like a fairytale


I'm in my lower 20s. He's in his mid 20s. All of my previous dates sucked ass and were so bad, and being gay was so hard but then I met this guy and it's craaazy. I'm so high but he says the nicest things and is adorable and goofy but super intelligent. He's kind of weird but the great type of weird and that's okay because I'm kind of weird too. And (most importantly!!!!!) he likes me back. 


I feel surreal."
12,"Dad threatening to kill me (18M) because I'm gay


Some background info before I start:

* I'm an 18 year old gay guy
* I've got Croatian citizenship, but I'm currently living in Bosnia and Herzegovina
* My parents have been divorced since 2004 and I used to live with my mother
* Moved out when I was 17 because I didn't get on with her very well
* Dad's an alcoholic and lives in Germany; we talk to each other over the phone every couple of weeks, but haven't seen each other since 2007
* Only two of my friends and some of my work colleagues know that I'm gay

**June 17th:**

Father called me at 2AM and we talked for about an hour about life and everyday stuff. I've been working two jobs and saving up money since I was 16, so I told him about my plans to start a business and how I convinced my colleague ""Alice"" to come work with me.

Alice used to work as a marketing manager at my old job, and I said I really liked her because she's an intelligent and highly energetic, goal-driven person. He jokingly asked me about her becoming his daughter-in-law, and I told him that's not happening anytime soon. He asked ""Why? You're not gay, are you?"". After I confirmed his suspicion, he said that nobody in his family was gay, so I can't be the exception.

Spent the next 10 minutes talking about very graphic ways he's going to end my life: said he knows some shady people in my city and that he's going to buy a gun and shoot me; I won't even see it coming, it'll all be over before I realise what's going on. I won't be able to hide from him because he was a soldier, and my death is inevitable. Also talked about chopping me up into ""small cubes"".

**My birthday:**

Just sent me a text saying ""Happy birthday"". I replied with ""Thank you. Have you calmed down yet?"". He said he did.

**June 23rd:**

Sent me a sticker with a cat saying ""How are you"". I didn't reply.

**July 2nd:**

Called me again while I was waiting for a taxi. Started with the usual small talk, then asked me if what I said recently was just a joke or truth. I said it's true, and he started talking about how he bought a new car, he's going to come to my city and he's not sure what he's going to do next. Then he hanged up. This time he didn't directly say anything bad, but it sounded threatening.

\---

I tried de-escalating the whole thing, I didn't yell at him, I used all the reasonable arguments, event left him to calm down for almost two weeks, and it didn't help. Now I'm terrified and don't know what to do. Should I call the police? What should I tell them? How are they going to handle this if he lives in another country? Should I call him and record the conversation just to have solid evidence? Anything else I should keep in mind?"
13,"What is the most obvious hint that a guy likes you that you've missed?


Stolen from askreddit, and turned gay."
14,"""The Epidemic of Gay Loneliness"" an article from the Huffington Post.


[https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/)  


I read this article earlier today and not gonna lie it got me misty with how relatable it is. I've always had issues in terms of initiating relationships with other gay men and it's relieving to see that at least there are people who are addressing the societal and medical aspects that contributes to these issues.   


And not going to lie, a lot, A LOT of the issues that the article brings to light are readily observable in this subreddit.   


I really do wish we treated other gay men including ourselves better. "
15,"Bi â€” but finally getting comfortable with the homo part


So Iâ€™ve always liked both girls and guys, ever since I could remember. Iâ€™m about to graduate college (22yo) and Iâ€™m finally getting used to the idea that being in a relationship with a man could be a likely possibility in the future. (Being with girls was never an issue)

Any other bi guys face this kind of challenge? I was kind of ashamed of liking guys for a while, and now I kinda see both genders the same; whoever I fall in love with could be a girl or a guy and Iâ€™m okay with that."
16,"How do gay porn star bottoms stay silent during anal sex?


I got fucked for the first time yesterday, and omg. The guy wasn't even that big, but he made me a hot message once he got himself in me. Literally fucked the air out of me, and all I could do was moan and gasp for air as he pounded me. Maybe I'm just a super vocal sub bottom ðŸ¤”?"
