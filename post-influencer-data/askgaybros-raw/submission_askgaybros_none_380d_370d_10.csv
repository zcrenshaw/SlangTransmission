0,"Leap of Faith


So, the local cafe barista / waiter / server is this nerdy goofy funny guy, and we have been flirting for about 2 months now. Until now i was not sure if he liked me back. But i wanted to let him know i liked him. When he came to clear the table next to mine, i asked to borrow his pen, and i wrote on the napkin, in front of him, with him watching, ""So we get along good and should hangout, my number is ..."" and gave it him. He went red in the face, but had the bigggggest grin from ear to ear. Then we parted ways with a wave. It is funny that i could not say it aloud but i could write it to him LOL. Who fucken knows if he will txt me?"

2,"What was your worst grindr hookup?


A few years ago, this ginger dad I thought was hot took me back to his place but his uncle lived with him so we had to sneak into this 32 year old man's bedroom window like teenagers. Besides that:

* He wanted us to shower together so his dick ended up tasting like strawberry shampoo.
* Turned on the AC unit in his room up super high to mask any noise coming from us. Going into his bedroom after that shower was not fun nor did he offer me a towel.
* Had fishy smoker's breath.
* Left the bedroom window open so mosquitoes flew in and bit me.
* Played early 2000s bisexual porn on his TV and laptop but also kept rewinding certain parts of it.
* Took an adderall beforehand so he had trouble staying hard.
* Kept going into snapchat to take pics.
* This was a few hours before his kid's birthday party in which his ex girlfriend with a complicated relationship would be attending. Turns out he had been using her phone to message me because they share it.

I really had no idea what I signed up for that night. He really seemed like a sweet guy but idiots can be sweet so yeah...never again."
3,"We need to talk about how Grindr is affecting gay men’s mental health.


I was reading this guy called Jack Turban who is a physician and medical writer at Harvard Medical School, where he researches gender and sexuality. I found this interesting. Please share your thoughts on this topic. 


When I open the Grindr app on my smartphone, I see there’s a 26-year-old man with tanned abs just 200 feet away. He’s called “looking4now,” and his profile explains that he wants sex at his place as soon as possible.Scrolling down, I find 100 similar profiles within a one-mile radius of my apartment in Boston. I can filter them by body type, sexual position (top, bottom, or versatile), and HIV status.

As a gay psychiatrist who studies gender and sexuality, I’m thrilled with the huge strides we’ve made over the past decade to bring gay relationships into the mainstream. The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. Today in Boston, two men can walk down the street holding hands without consequence.

But I’m worried by the rise of the underground digital bathhouse. Apps like Grindr, with 3 million daily active users, and others like Scruff and Jack’d, are designed to help gay men solicit sex, often anonymously, online. I am all for sexual liberation, but I can’t stop wondering if these apps also have a negative effect on gay men’s mental health.

Since there’s little published research on the men using Grindr, I decided to conduct an informal survey and ask men why they’re on the app so much and how it’s affecting their relationships and mental health. I created a profile identifying myself as a medical writer looking to talk to men about their experiences. I received about 50 responses (including propositions).

It’s a small sample size, but enough to give us some clues about how Grindr is affecting gay men. And it doesn’t look good.

Apps like Grindr are designed to make finding sex easy. And that can make them hard to stop using.

The most common reason users gave for going on the app is that sex feels great and Grindr makes it accessible, right at your fingertips. The screen full of half-naked men excites users. With a few clicks, there’s a possibility of meeting a sexual partner within the hour.
Neuroscientists have shown that orgasm causes activation of pleasure areas of the brain like the ventral tegmental area while deactivating areas involved with self-control. And these patterns of activation in men are strikingly similar to what researchers see in the brain of individuals using heroin or cocaine. So when a neutral action (clicking on Grindr) is paired with a pleasurable response in the brain (orgasm), humans learn to do that action over and over again.

This can be a normal pleasure response or it could be a setup for addiction, depending on the situation and individual.

Grindr, intentionally or not, also leverages a psychological concept called variable ratio reinforcement, in which rewards for clicking come at unpredictable intervals. You may find a hookup immediately, or you may be on your phone for hours before you find one.

Variable ratio reinforcement is one of the most effective ways to reinforce behavior, and it makes stopping that behavior extremely difficult. Slot machines are a classic example. Because gamblers never know when the next payout will come, they can’t stop pulling the handle. They hold out hope that the next pull will give them the pleasurable sound of coins clanking against a metal bin, and they end up pulling for hours.

Now imagine a slot machine that rewards you with an orgasm at unpredictable intervals. This is potentially a powerful recipe for addiction and may explain why one user I spoke with stays on Grindr for up to 10 hours at a time, hoping to find the perfect partner for casual sex.

The phrase “addiction” continues to be controversial when it comes to sex and technology, But as John Pachankis, an LGBTQ mental health expert at the Yale School of Public Health, described the impact of Grindr to me: “I don’t know if it’s an ‘addiction,’ but I know it causes a lot of distress.”

For now, it’s hard to know just how many Grindr users feel their use of the app is problematic. Early research on app use and health has focused only on sexually transmitted infections, for instance, rates of HIV among Grindr users, using Grindr to get people tested for STIs, etc.

Just last week, Grindr announced that it will start sending users HIV testing reminders and the addresses of local testing sites (on an opt-in basis). In less pleasant news, BuzzFeed revealed on Monday that Grindr has also been sharing the HIV status of its users with third-party companies. (The company later said it would stop sharing the information.)

Though there is this new attention to sexual health, both Grindr and the research community have been silent on mental health. Yet since 2007, more gay men have died from suicide than from HIV.
This suggests it’s time we start thinking about Grindr’s health effects more broadly. Other dating apps, like Tinder, for example, are now the subject of early research looking at mental health implications. It’s time to do the same for gay hookup apps.

Grindr may provide men with some relief from their anxiety and depression. But it’s temporary.

For some users I talked to, the allure of Grindr was not just the rush to feel good. It was to stop feeling bad. Users told me they log on when they feel sad, anxious, or lonely. Grindr can make those feelings go away. The attention and potential for sex distract from painful emotions.

A staggering number of gay men suffer from depression, with some estimates as high as 50 percent. Because gay men’s anxiety and depression often stem from childhood rejection for being gay, messages of affirmation from other gay men are particularly appealing. Unfortunately, these messages are typically only skin-deep: “Hey man, cute pic. Looking to ****?”

A recent survey of 200,000 iPhone users by Time Well Spent, a nonprofit focused on the digital attention crisis, showed that 77 percent of Grindr users felt regret after using the app.

The users I interviewed told me that when they closed their phones and reflected on the shallow conversations and sexually explicit pictures they sent, they felt more depressed, more anxious, and even more isolated. Some experience overwhelming guilt following a sexual encounter in which no words are spoken. After the orgasm, the partner may walk out the door with little more than a “thanks.”

And yet they keep coming back for that temporary emotional relief. One user told me that he feels so bad after a hookup that he jumps right back on the app, continuing the cycle until he is so tired he falls asleep. Every once in a while, he deletes the app, but he finds himself downloading it the next time he feels rejected or alone.

“We see patients like this almost every day,” Pachankis told me. “Apps like Grindr are often both a cause and a consequence of gay and bisexual men’s disproportionally poorer mental health. It’s a truly vicious cycle.”

Not all Grindr users are addicted and depressed, of course. Some users I interacted with seem to use Grindr in a healthy, positive way. One man I interviewed met his fiancé there; they are excitedly planning their wedding. Some I spoke with said they use the app for sex but haven’t suffered any negative consequences and have control over their use.

Using Grindr may keep men from finding lasting relationships

Why do so many of these men turn to Grindr to begin with? Perhaps Grindr’s popularity is a sign we haven’t made as much social progress as we think for same-sex relationships. The general population seems comfortable with the idea of gay marriage, but it’s still difficult for a gay man to find a partner.

One 23-year-old user told me that the only places he can find gay men are clubs and Grindr, and both are hypersexualized. The cultures of both intimidate him. According to Pachankis, gay culture is often “status-focused, competitive, hierarchical, and exclusionary.” He explains that these traits are common among men generally, but in the gay community, they become amplified in a group that “both socializes and sexualizes together.”
The 23-year-old is afraid of rejection, and Grindr shields him from the pain of in-person turndowns. “My framework now is sex first. I don’t know how to date people in person.”

His relationships, he says, start with casual sex on Grindr. They first meet at 2 am for a hookup. He’ll try to schedule the next sex date a little earlier, maybe 11 pm. Then the next step may be drinks.

But this sex-first approach hasn’t led to lasting relationships for the men I interviewed and is affecting their self-worth and identity. “My self-esteem now is all about my sexual ability,” the 23-year-old said. “I don’t feel confident about myself as a partner in any other way.”
Another user told me he downloaded the app hoping to find a husband. Now he says that when he and a boyfriend (he’s gone through several) fight, his natural response is to open Grindr to “find an alternative” instead of working through problems. He can’t maintain a monogamous relationship because he is constantly cheating.

There may be ways to treat men with problematic Grindr use

The mental health professionals I spoke to are seeing problematic Grindr use in their clinics. And there is little published guidance on how to help those who are struggling.
Doctors I spoke to say the best available tools for treating problematic Grindr use are the ones they use in general sex addiction treatment. Citalopram, a common antidepressant, was shown in one small study to be helpful with sex addiction in gay men. Naltrexone, a drug commonly used for other compulsive behaviors, may work as well.

For more extreme cases, patients could request hormonal implants that turn off testosterone signaling, making sexual cravings less intense. However, even these treatments have modest empirical support at best, and none have been studied for hookup app use specifically.

Dr. Shane Kraus, the director of the behavioral addictions clinic at Bedford Veterans Hospital and an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, says the most promising treatment for problematic Grindr use is likely talk therapy techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can teach patients to engage in other behaviors that are more productive (though often more difficult and time-consuming than Grindr) to help them feel loved or supported.

Another psychotherapeutic technique known as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) can help teach patients how to better tolerate the feeling of being alone without logging on to Grindr.

The dynamics of Grindr, though, are complicated, and it can take time to work through all the angles. Are you self-soothing anxiety? Are you addicted to sex? Have you lost interest in your monogamous relationship? Do you think you can’t attain love, so you’re settling for hookups? Did your parents tell you being gay is wrong and you’re searching for acceptance? Ultimately, Kraus explains that therapy can help clarify these kinds of thoughts and feelings, and lead to insights that bring about a healthy change.

He also believes it’s only a matter of time before states and the federal government sponsor research exploring Grindr use and mental health. Grindr did not respond to our request for comment on this piece. But if future data supports what I suspect about the link between Grindr and mental health problems, even small interventions like advertising mental health resources on the app may help to address these users’ suffering.

As we continue to fight to bring gay relationships into the mainstream, we need to keep an eye on Grindr and how it both reflects and affects gay culture. The bathhouse is still around. It’s now open 24/7, accessible from your living room.

4,"Advice dealing with my son


A friend pointed me here as a place to get some advice. I don't know how much detail to include. Trying to stay halfway anonymous.

I have two adult sons. The older one is having some kind of a meltdown and I have to get a handle on how to approach it. I'll be seeing him soon. I have been a long distance father for most of their lives, because of work and life shit.

My older son seemed to be doing fine, a good job, engaged to a nice girl. Then in the middle of the summer things started to break down, the engagement was off, he was having problems at work. He moved in with my younger son, who has been communicating with me about the situation. Older son had to move out of his house share because apparently he'd started having loud sex with men at all hours and the guys he was living with didn't like it.

The two of them are very different, older son has always seemed to be on edge or nervous. They are close in age, my younger son has always been naturally confident and outgoing and the older was the one with self confidence problems. Younger was a rule breaker, older was a people pleaser.

I don't know the terminology, if he's gay or bisexual or what. Or if this is a change or a phase. I don't have any experience with this. I was raised with a lot of prejudice in this area and I know fuckall.

I have been in touch with a man who was working with him on a contract this summer and started to notice his changes in behavior, also his brother has tried to fill me in but I feel like maybe he is shielding me because he doesn't know how I will react. Older son has avoided contact with me, so I'm traveling to see them both.

Not sure about a specific question except, how can I not fuck this up? They were mostly raised by my brother who in kind words is a fucking idiot. It's too little too late but what's done is done and I want to show up. 

He went to see somebody, I don't know if he's taking medication or what is happening. Don't know what questions to ask or where to start.

7,"Well, this sucks. Boyfriends family doesn't want me at his sister's wedding.


I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I'm a complete whitebread Canadian, he's Filipino. We are both out to our families. His entire family, except for his sister, live in the Philippines and have never met me (apart from his sister). My family likes him even more than they like me, and are 100% accepting. His family has been indifferent at best. To my knowledge they have never asked about me, or shown any interest in our relationship (I'm unsure if they even know my name). His sister was very cold to me when she first met me, and when I mentioned it to my boyfriend he confronted her about it... her attitude improved after that but I don't know if it was a genuine change.

Anyways, over the past year his sister has been planning to get married in the Philippines, and we had planned to go. I've tried to broach the subject of his family a few times, because I didn't believe they were fully accepting of him, but he seemed really unwilling even to talk about it. He said that when he came out, his father told him ""as long as you are happy, thats all that matters"", and that proves his family accepts him.  I could see a lot of red flags that indicated the opposite (i.e if we go on a trip and post a ton of pictures on facebook, they will only likes photos that I am not in). 

Anyways, this morning he woke up to a text from his sister saying she had spoken to their father and he had decided I should not come to the wedding because it would embarass the family if all their friends and neighbors learned their son has a boyfriend. My boyfriend, to his great credit, immediately texted his father a long text basically saying that if I am not invited, then he is not going. His father hasnt replied yet.

Anyways, I had just had to vent. I've never been in a situation like this before. On top of that, my boyfriend hates confrontation, and I'm worried they will pressure him until he cracks. Maybe this sounds selfish, but if he decides to go and leave me behind, that would be the end of our relationship in my view. 

Has anyone else faced this?"
8,"Did you ever receive an unexpected hug?


What’s up guys, I’m still closeted and my group of friends don’t really show affection of any kind. The most we give each other is a handshake, the usual.


So last week I went with my friends to the to movies (group of five including myself). While we were walking to the movie  room I bumped into an acquaintance from college. He was excited to see me (I was taken aback because we weren’t really close, we took a class together and studied a lot, he was more like a .... Facebook friend) he then gives me this huge hug and MY GOD. I’ve never felt so good. He is a bit taller and bigger than me too. It was few seconds but I wanted to hold on longer. I didn’t want to make things awkward so we catch up for a min then he leaves and we head to our movie.


I never realized how much I needed a hug then. Before that hug, honestly I don’t think I’ve made contact with another person for a few years before that. 

Everyone can use a hug. So go out there and hug your friends/SOs/family."
9,"Husband cheated. Says he didn't mean it like that. Keep him or dump him?


  

I am 27, husband is 26, our first wedding anniversary is in ten days and we’ve been together for four years.

I caught my husband sending and receiving explicit texts from another man, whom I have never met before. I know of this guy based on casually seeing that there’s a text from “Gino” in his phone, but never looked into it or thought anything of it. I asked him about a year ago who Gino was, just out of curiosity, and my husband said “he’s just a friend”. I assumed that he meant an old college friend. 

We had a big fight on Friday night. We had both been drinking but I had started to sober up. We were with his mother, and they were both hammered drunk. They were both picking on me quite a bit, and I had asked them to stop on numerous occasions and eventually just said that I wanted us to go home and all go to bed. I told them that I was going to step outside after I paid all of our tabs and ordered us an Uber home. They came out a few minutes later acting shocked that someone paid their bills and I said it was me. My husband told me I was a liar and that I was being mean to him by lying. I had finally had enough and I said something that I shouldn’t have: I told him that if I’m that mean and that covering his drinks was so wrong, then he should skip his ass on down to the courthouse on Tuesday and file for a divorce. I shouldn’t have said it, and I apologized immediately after saying it. We got in the car and got home, his mom passed out right away, and he passed out on the floor. After I cleaned him up and got him to bed, we went to bed and I let things go for the night because we’ve all had drunken fights before. Whatever.

So the next day, I woke up on my own and both of them were still out cold. I got ready and went to the store to get stuff to make breakfast, and made them breakfast from scratch just because it was the weekend. We ate and started to talk. His mom had no recollection from the night before. I asked to keep the discussion between us so we waited to talk until she went back to her house. We started talking and he said he didn’t recall either. I gave him a rundown of the evening and he was crying on the couch. He went into our bedroom and laid down in bed and cried. I went in to try to help comfort him, because even though I was mad at him, I wanted us to resolve things and get back to normal. We talked for a solid hour, and he was upset and told me how awful he felt about it and that he loves me and just wants to be okay. I told him that I was still upset with him, but that I loved him and tucked him in to take a nap because he was still hungover.

Now for the moment my world crashed down. I realized his phone was still plugged in out in the living room, so I went out to get it for him and brought it to him. His screen had a popup that Gino texted. So me being curious, and a bit petty, I opened it up and saw that it was full of dick pics and texts. Both of them had sent them to each other, including gym videos and masturbation videos, and sexting. My husband told him that he wants to “hear (him) moaning while he fucks him” among other things. I almost passed out from the shock of it and had to take a minute to compose myself. I went in, he was still awake, and I set his phone down next to him. I told him “By the way, tell Gino to stop sending you dick pics”, and I left the room. I went downstairs and just sat on the couch and waited. I was so angry that I couldn’t cry, so sad that I couldn’t ask anyone for advice, so broken that I just felt alone. A few minutes later, my husband texted me and said that he is so sorry and he feels dead inside. A big long text conversation happened, and then he asked me if we were breaking up. I said no, that I love him, but that he fucked up and it is going to take me time to come to terms with things. Then I said that I don’t know if we are going to be together or not. I still don’t. Today’s my first day at home by myself without him (I took the day off of work to think) and I have no idea what I want to do or what I should do. We talked some more about it and he said that he didn’t cheat, that this was just porn, and nothing more, and that he would never cheat on me. 

I could stay. I want to stay. I love him, we have our house and a marriage and a dog, and I don’t want to publicly shame him with a divorce and have everyone find out why. Plus, he declared bankruptcy right before we got married. If we got divorced, he would have absolutely nothing and his life would be ruined. Plus, the house is in my name only, and I’m not about to have to sell my house and give him half of the money because he fucked up.

But at the same time, I want him to get the fuck out of my life. I feel stupid. I feel taken advantage of. I make about 20 grand a year more than he does. I can pay the bills myself but it would be tough. All I can think of today are the things that I dislike about him. He’s a picky eater, he’s lazy, he has a shitload of student loan debt, and he fucking cheated on me. I considered this cheating, and he said it wasn’t. I said, “but \*I feel that this is cheating\*” and he just started crying.

I don’t know what the fuck to do. I’m so upset about it and I feel that I can’t even talk to my family about it because if we do stay together, they’re going to judge the shit out of me for it and won’t ever see him the same either. 

Also, advice to anyone on here...don't fool around with a married man. Shouldn't even have to fucking say it. And Geno, if you're on this sub (I have no idea), you ought to reach out and explain yourself. It might actually help the situation."

I have met too many people (in real life and online) that bemoan the shallowness of apps and the lack of responses on apps when they have the most boring profile ever. I'm talking 1-2 pics on their Tinder, both of which are poorly taken selfies. And a bio that reads ""just ask"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Or their Grindr pic has them covering half their face and their bio is ""get to know me"". Like, if you know you're not the most attractive person, the least you could do is have an interesting bio. Not just a list of what you're into or not into. Not just ""too-cool-for-this"" snark. But a short, sweet, message that tells people something interesting about your personality. If you want people to send more than ""hey"" than maybe give them something to talk about.
