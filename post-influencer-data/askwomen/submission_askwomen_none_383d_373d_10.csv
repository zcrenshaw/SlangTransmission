"Hey, AskWomen...do you ever knowingly code switch?


I mean in the broad sociological way.

For the uninitiated, it means changing the way you present and express different parts of your identity to people.

An example is [here in this video of Barack Obama](https://youtu.be/30-lYueJivk?t=27) in 2009. In the video which is in a hot dog restaurant in Chicago, the cashier asked him if he wants his change. He responded ""Naw, we straight."" He delivered his first Inaugural address the same month.

I'm more wondering about how you knowingly change how you present yourself in public on your own, rather than to fill familial/professional obligation."
