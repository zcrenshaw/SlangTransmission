"You Know You‚Äôve Been Together Too Long When Your Bf Says This During Sex


So, on my lunch break yesterday I went to Trader Joe‚Äôs to grab some groceries. Bf was at work and sent me a short list of what he wanted. When we got home later I hopped on him the second I saw him, dying for some post work stress-release sex. 5 minutes into me riding him on our living room couch, and in-between moans and grunts, he casually asks, ‚ÄúDid you remember to get the dark chocolate covered caramels?‚Äù

Without missing a beat I answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù in a breathy voice, as if he had asked me a sexy question. Then a minute later, realizing the absurdity of the whole situation, I just about died laughing. Later he felt really bad that his sweet tooth had killed the mood. "
"PUNCHED THE FU*KER IN THE FACE


I ve been chatting with this guy via Grinder for one week and decided to meet. This was my third hookup after i broke off with my boyfriend of 4 years. Anyway as ovious from the title, the hookup was a disaster. The guy was playing all cool and nice on the app. We discussed what we both liked, me vers, him top so on‚Ä¶

We had a beer at his pace and a quick chatt and than we were on. Well the guy turned out to be one of those ¬ªagressive tops¬´ that likes to take comand and be in controll. The moment it started he was all over me, pinning me, my hands.. i was coll so far, not my type of foreplay but went along. He ask-told me to strip, get on the bed‚Ä¶i wanted some time to admire his body but his hard dick was at my face in one second. I had to stop him multiple times, he was litteraly facefucking my mouth, he was grabing my head like it was his lifeline, i hate that. Anyway he wouldnt give me a blowjob, he doesnt do that, i'm a top he said (he lied on the app and by this time i knew this was not going to be one of the hookups i would remember fondly, but just a quick emotionless fuck). He turned me around and started eating me, that was better. We discussed before that i might be willing to bottom, but that it was a while from the last time and that he would have to go slow. And he did not. A quick preparation with two fingers and he was pushing his way in ( he gloved up and lubed before he ""preped"" me) And the fucker had no patience, after i told him to slow down that i need more prep he went on saying its ok man, youre good, youre going to enjoy this, just relax. I told him no way are we doing it like this ( i really was tight) and the next thing he does is just ram his dick right in. The pain was real, let me tell you, i hurt more than the first time i took cock. I yelled stop to pool out, and when i fet his grip on my neck, pushing me down i snapped. I moved off ( yes it hurt) turned and fisted his face with all the anger i had. He went flying off the bed. The guy was bigger and no doubt stronger than me but at that time i dnot know what i would have done if he went after me. I said and i quote ¬ªdont move from the floor you sick fuck¬´ He didnt, i dressed and slammed the door an my way out.

That was tow days ago. Im totaly ok, my ass is better, i dont feel victamized or anything just pissed, i would have fight that guy if i had to. It just sickens me to know that there are guys like that out there. And the one thing i'll never do again is hookup with a guy that claims hiself to be a dominant top. he was all about controll, didnt even touched my dick and i coulnt even touch his ass. Fuck that shit. Vers or bottoms from now on.

Sorry for all the typos, had to get this down quicly..."
"My Little Brother Finally Came Out!


Hey everybody, it's been a very long time since I lasted posted here; more than a year! 

This was my post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4w0lz8/my\_little\_brother\_still\_wont\_tell\_my\_parents\_hes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4w0lz8/my_little_brother_still_wont_tell_my_parents_hes/)), and I received an overwhelming number of responses! I was told not to do anything, and let my little brother go at his own pace, which I decided to do.

In my update ([https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4w6wf9/update\_my\_little\_brother\_still\_wont\_tell\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4w6wf9/update_my_little_brother_still_wont_tell_my/)), I explained what had happened the next day. I felt like my run on Reddit was over. I had gotten the information I'd needed on how to handle the situation, and I updated everyone on how it was going.

Well, about a month ago, my brother came out to my parents! And I felt it was only right to update all of you who had read my previous posts. Now, before I get on to what happened, I'd just like to thank all of the people who commented and PM'd me on how to handle the situation, because it helped a lot. The only thing I did was occasionally and lightly bring up something about same-sex marriage, and get a positive response from my parents to try and help comfort my brother on it. 

Anyways, since my last update, my brother's sexuality really hadn't come up. He had a few boyfriends (not really dating or anything, just light relationships that really didn't go anywhere) and I'd ask about them from time to time, but that was really it. In fact, until the day he came out, I'd almost forgotten about it. But one night, when we were eating dinner, my brother was more quiet than usual. I could tell me parents had noticed, but they didn't say anything (I'm assuming because they didn't want to push questions on him). Finally, he spoke:  


""So, um, yeah... I wanted to tell you guys something earlier but I didn't have the chance.""

My parents, seemed slightly concerned, probably because his voice was a bit shaky and nervous ""Oh? Is everything ok?""

He said everything was fine, and then he kind of stumbled around for a bit. And it was at this moment I realized what was happening, and I my heart kind of jumped a little.

""I just wanted to let you guys know that.... um...."" about 10 seconds of near silence, ""I'm gay.""

My parents just looked for a little, but then my mom began to smile and said, ""Oh, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you didn't have to be nervous! We love you no matter what!""

My dad, ""Yeah, of course! And thank god. I was expecting bad news,"" or something like that. Then they stood up and hugged, and when they did, weight was lifted off of MY shoulders, so I couldn't imagine what it was like for my little brother. 

Then we talked about it a bit more, and my mom got a little annoyed (in a playful sort of way) that she didn't get to meet some of my little brother's ex-boyfriends, because she's all into that kind of a thing.

And since then, it's been great! My brother has been more outgoing, and overall happier. I could tell that anvils were lifted from his shoulders.  


Now that my little brother's arc has been complete, this will probably be my final post. Again, I want to thank all of you who gave me advice, and who gave encouraging words! It means a lot to me and my little brother especially."

"Why aren't gays calling their asses ""cockpits""?


I've heard it in porn, they'll call it, their ""pussy"" ""boy pussy"" ""bussy""? Idk it's just a thought I had looking at the cover for Top Gun."

"I'm really jealous of Pretty Gays


There, I said it.

I try my best to stay in shape, keep up with hygiene, dress well, make myself as attractive as possible, and yet I know deep down I'm always going to be out shadowed by the pretty gays. You know, the guys who don't have to try, that just were blessed to have pretty features and the ones everyone wants to fuck.

I have this gay friend who gets lots of attention cuz he's a pretty boy, and I find it hard to relate to him sometimes when we hang out. He will ask me (since we live in a small town) if I know x or y since he has a lot of gay friends in the area, and I usually tell him no, but the real truth is I've talked with them before and they've ignored me/stopped messaging me. Or he'll talk to me about he has a lot of hook ups and I struggle to find people to have sex with.

Gahhhhh sorry if I sound like a whiney bitch. I know it's dumb to be jealous of things you can't control I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest so I can stop thinking about it. I think what gets to me most is just that its already hard being gay, but it also seems that being gay and average/ugly/not pretty is just another cherry on top to an already difficult life. I already have a hard time relating to straight people, but nto being able to relate to other gays is just so damn isolating."
"Is it normal to be a gay guy in your 20s and still be a virgin?


Everyone always acts so surprised when I tell them I'm a virgin (I'm 21), both straight and gay folks alike. So many of them assume that I'm 'waiting' for the right person and bang on about how they respect my decision blah blah blah. But that's not even the case. By no means am I waiting for somebody special - I just don't want my first time to be with a random person. I'd rather get to know them a little bit first. I'm not really out and I've had no success with Grindr - they either ignore me or don't believe me when I tell them I'm a virgin, or they lose interest once I tell them that I'm not interested in 'right now'. It's getting embarrassing and is grating on my self-esteem."
"Came out to my friends


AND WE GROUP HUGGED!! 

I was contemplating coming out to them for some time and last night I finally got the courage to do so. We were drinking and I pulled them aside and just told them I was gay and they were super supportive and told me they kind of suspected it because I would never talk about hooking up with girls. I‚Äôm just so happy because now I feel like I don‚Äôt have to hide anything from them!! I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt do this earlier... üôÇ

"confused af


So basically I though that I'm straight my entire life, however yesterday I was at this party and met a guy. He is fairly attractive and EXTREMELY intelligent in a way that i was very intimidated by him the whole time, I got drunk and realized that chatting isn't the only thing that i want to do with him tonight. We have been talking for couple of hours and gotta admit, I have never been intelectually stimulated like that and just a sheer notion of him being so fucking smart turned me on no end. I didn't know what to do with that situation, so apart from being a little flirtatious nothing happened from my end, at least at a time. Our friend that was a host has a pretty big house so I could've slept in my own bedroom but I ""accidentally"" found myself sharing a bed with him, I don't know what I was thinking but just couldn't get enough of this guy. He fell asleep and I literally felt physical pain not being able to cuddle up with him, never experienced anything like that before. Anyways my drunk ass gave in and I embraced him hoping that he wouldn't wake up, he didn't (or at least didn't do anything with my arm) and it felt SO DAMN GOOD that i just wanted to stay like that forever. When I woke up, still cuddled up with him I chickened out and just left. I don't know what the fuck happened, don't know what I want from him and I'm pretty sure he doesn't want anything from me but I'm pretty confused since I can't stop thinking about him. "
"DAE think the bros of this sub are too quick to end relationships??


*Boyfriend is gaining a little weight?* Tell him to sign up for My600lbLife then dump his fat ass. That'll motivate him for sure.


*Boyfriend isn't a porn star in bed?* He's sexually dead and you deserve amazing sex. Run for the hills!


*Boyfriend isn't entirely out of the closet?* It sure is more of a burden for you than it is for him, throw him away for the internalized homophobe that he is.

Im exaggerating but only a little. Lately I feel like most relationship advice here is to just dump a guy and move on. Theres always that line where something's gotta give, but I wonder how you all manage to stay in a relationship for a long period of time."
"Is it just me or does anyone else get really irritated by people who moan and groan about how they are unattractive yet make no effort to change?


For example if they make no effort with personal hygiene, or never leave the house or do any exercise. Or even pick their nose in front of you. It's just disgusting and I'm finding I have less and less patience for people who don't even care about themselves yet expect other people to care about them. "
