"Which stereotype about the UK pisses you off the most?


The stereotypes surrounding the food here really annoys me, earlier today I saw someone on a reddit thread say most British people don’t like garlic... I mean, I’m sure some people don’t, but I bet the majority love garlic, it’s in everything and a kebab isn’t complete without garlic and chilli sauce.
I wonder if this stereotype will ever die? We have some of the best restaurants in the world, world famous chefs and just good food for the most part and yet we’re still mocked for it.

"What should I do about my inconsiderate neighbour?


[removed]"
"Aggressive neighbour shouting in the building all the time, and particularly this morning he has been shouting for about an hour now. Should I call the police?


I live on the first floor of a building. The neighbour who recently moved downstairs (ground floor) is very unpleasant. He has repeatedly come knocking on my door about fictitious issues, and last week he started shouting at me in the door about someone banging on his ceiling. I calmly explained that I had no idea who was banging on his ceiling, but he continued shouting at me about this and accusing me of banging (I have no clue what he was on about since I was simply lying in bed at that point, I wasn't doing anything that could cause banging noises). I eventually managed to close the door and then I phoned the police and informed them of the situation but decided not to ask them to pay him a visit. 

I work from home some days (today being one of them) and the situation is just reaching an unbearable point. Now he's shouting in the hallway of the building and keeps slamming his door in between bouts of shouting. I do not know what he's shouting about or why.  It seems like he's just shouting by himself. I am at a point where I feel unsafe in my house, and want to leave and go work somewhere else. However I am afraid I will run into him downstairs and so I feel trapped in my own house. 

Should I phone the police right now?  I'm afraid I will aggravate the situation but I need to be able to work and also not feel terrified in my own house. "
