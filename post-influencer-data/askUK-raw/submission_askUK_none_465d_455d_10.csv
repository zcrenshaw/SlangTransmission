"Support for those bereaved at a young age?


I can’t believe I’m having to write this but earlier this week my partner of 10 years, passed away unexpectedly and suddenly from a cardiac arrest whilst out exercising. He was only 29, I am only 27. My whole world has fallen apart and I am completely lost. Our families and friends have been excellent and really supportive, but none of them truly understand the loss I am experiencing. Losing a parent/grandparent/sibling etc is difficult and I have experienced this myself, but I am discovering that losing a partner is something else. I had moved across the country to be with him, and now I have not only lost my partner but probably also my job and home as I can’t bear the thought of living away without him. I feel like I’m having to start over again. Because we weren’t married I also don’t count as a widow so I don’t even know what I am and feel a little bit like my grief is not as valid because we were unmarried - but 10 years is longer than most marriages I know. I’m in the south east although I’m not sure I could cope with face to face support at the minute as I am very much a mess and in the height of grief. "
"I am a carer here in UK with too much free time. What paid and free online courses can I take to improve my CV?


Hello

I am a carer here in UK with too much free time. I would like to know about online courses that I can take from home and would improve my CV. 

At the moment I am actively learning languages but I am looking for something different. 

Any help is well appriciated!
Kind regards"
"Desperately looking for job-ideas for my mum at 62 with no qualifications


My mum was a full time carer for a disabled family member for 30 years. He recently passed away. She is 62 and 3.5 years away from receiving her state pension. She has left-side weakness due to a previous stroke. She left school at age 15 with 3 GCSEs and has no other qualifications. Her work history includes being a driver in the armed forces for 5 years in the 1970s and she also has a HGV1 license and experience handling large vehicles but again that was 30 years ago. She has an unrestricted motorcycle license too but I can't imagine my 62 year old mum bombing around! She has her own car and a clean license.
I don't want to seem like I'm insulting my mum but in the spirit of actually finding something she can do, I'll also say that she is great at maths but not good at reading, writing, spelling. 

She has just signed on to job seekers and they are pushing her to apply for jobs. She is very confused to be honest and not receiving any practical advice over what she can apply for or how to improve herself, so is basically going to an appointments and sitting there clicking things for a few hours. She's already been yelled at for her CV being ""poor quality"" but she literally has nothing to add to it. She has applied to some supermarket jobs but I can't imagine them hiring her with her issues and lack of work history. She also applied for some delivery person jobs but again I don't think they will hire her when they can hire someone who is 21 as she is obviously a lot slower.

She would be happy to do non-medical care work as that's what she's essentially done for the last 30 years (including getting people dressed, feeding, bathing, helping with house work etc). She is not afraid of hard work. But has zero qualifications and says she hasn't seen any jobs listed like that (there are lots of care home jobs but they require nursing/care qualifications).

Does anyone have any suggestions for what any sort of job that she might be able to do at her age and situation? Or should she just tick the boxes and go to interviews and get failed out of every one for the next 3 years until state pension kicks in?

She is in council accommodation in a 1 bed flat, very little bills, very frugal woman and JSA is just enough for her to survive and so is state pension but if they took her JSA away, she would be screwed and that's giving her a lot of anxiety so she would prefer to work if there was anything out there suitable for her, but I'm wondering if low-skill people that close to retirement age ever even get hired."

What act of impoliteness gets you annoyed the most? Personally, its the lack of a 'thank-you wave' when giving another motorist the right of way."
