"Top Chuckle Brothers’ lines


With the death of Barry (the short one) announced this morning, who has any great memories to share about the Chuckle Brothers? Any memorable one-liners?

Inb4 To me, to you"
"Seriously how is M&amp;S food especially the fruit so much better than anyone else's?


I am currently enjoying the strawberry season and have tried all the main supermarkets and my local greengrocer, I have even grown some of my own strawberries, but none are as nice and those in Marks.  How do they achieve this?  And it's not just strawberries most other fruits are much superior.  I really want to know."
"What are the best brochures I can get delivered?


Ok I think this is a bit weird, but I love reading brochures and catalogues in the bath, and was wondering if anyone has any good recommendations?

I already get Lakeland, which is absolutely the best for mindlessly flipping through and pretending you are Delia, and I've done quite a few travel brochures before for fantasy holiday planning. What am I missing? Generic Argos ones aren't as fun (and way too heavy). "
"I consider myself left leaning, but everything I’ve read about thatcher closing the mines seem to make sense. What are the arguments here?


I’ve been brought up to hate thatcher, and I don’t like the current Tory government. But as far as I can tell, thatcher did an unpopular thing that was necessary to push Britain forward.  Coal use was way down in the 80s, and it stripped a lot of people of their work, but the demand simply wasn’t there! What are the alternatives, were they supposed to keep producing something no one wanted, just for the  sake of having a job? Did thatcher do a really unpopular thing that was ultimately necessary? Please explain"
