"People who like hot weather, why?


There's always people looking forward to the summer weather, and I can never work out just what it is about being sweaty, lethargic, thirsty and generally uncomfortable for a month that's so appealing; so what's so great about it?"
"People who moved to the UK from another country, what is better, and what do you miss about your home country?


If you moved to the Uk from another country, what do you miss from home? What do you like better here?"
"Does anyone have the McDonald's Whistleblowing procedure?


(x-post from /r/McLounge)

~~I've made a few posts around here about my store~~, which is a Food Safety Hazard (ants in the coffee machine, 30 minute hand washing never enforced, cooking with bare hands) and other unethical practices the managers do.


&amp;nbsp;


Trouble is, I want to report it anonymously. It needs reporting, if one ill employee is in kitchen, they are going to make loads of customers ill. Seeing ants crawling inside the whipped cream too, yuck.


&amp;nbsp;

Here's a quote from the employee hand book:

&gt; The Company's Whistleblowing Procedure provides safeguards for you if you raise concerns in good faith about malpractice in connection with the Company.


But a few lines later, it says this:

&gt; Full details of the Company's Whistle blowing Procedure can be obtained from your manager who will be able to get them from the Company's Intranet.


So it essentially says ""we try to safeguard you, but you need to tell a manager so we know if you whistle blowing. How are are they going to ""safegaurd"" me if I have to ask a manager for a procedure which gives them a good indication that it's me whistleblowing?


(I can get the whole section from the employee handbook if you need it). "
