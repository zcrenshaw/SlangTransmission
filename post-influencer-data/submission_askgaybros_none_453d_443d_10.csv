"I think I just witnessed a married man cheating on his wife with a twink...


So I go to the grocery store with my boyfriend and we both recognize an old hookup twink friend who works there. 

We all said hello and all that. Then I noticed a muscled Latino man, I think 30 or so, with a beard and wearing a tank, with his wife who was obese and his son walk into the grocery store and he and the twink give each other the queer eyeüëÄ 

Our twink friend said he has to use the bathroom. We say bye. So when we finally check out, we notice that the latino guy leaves the bathroom, then a minute later the twink comes out üòµü§≠ (this was one of those single person bathroom)

My boyfriend and I were shooketh. We sat in the car mouth agape. Now we‚Äôre sipping our teaüê∏‚òïÔ∏è and about to eat pizza."

"What is the WORST marriage proposal (gay or straight) you have witnessed?


My husband and I were eating at the Blue Bayou restaurant at Disneyland right by the water. Next table over was a straight couple. Half way through our we hear a SHREEEK of happiness and see this guy down on one knee with the ring. Waitress brings over a bottle of something and flowers. Over the next couple of hours we watch as the woman IGNORES her new fiance and begins posting the ring on social media and begins CALLING person after person in her phone and GLOATING at the top of her lungs with every call.  At one point we hear her say ""Oh Hi Jane! I know we haven't spoken since I left my job at XYZ company...but I wanted to let you know that I AM ENGAGED!!! YES! MY ring looks like....and the setting of MY ENGAGEMENT is at the Blue Bayou...and MY parents are SO happy... I just called them right after IT happened!"" We watched as the guy sunk lower and lower into his seat. This woman never ONCE looked at him over the following 90 mins!!! We felt so SICK for this guy. You could see he was setting himself up for a lifetime of HELL with this narcissistic banshee. We almost....and I mean ALMOST stopped at the table and told the woman how heartless she was and to tell the guy to RUN. (But figured it wasn't our place) I still think about them whenever we go there. "

"My son and his body image


Hello! My son has recently came out and my whole family and I completely support him. However, over the past three months he‚Äôs had an obsession with his physical appearance. He will run two 5ks a day (once in the morning and once in the evening) and after that he will use the weights that we have at our house. I have no problem with his new intense exercise regimen; however, he is not wasting enough. He says that he will only eat 250 calories a day and burn 1200. You can tell that he is serious by the weight he has dropped. He is a 5‚Äô10 male and before all of this he weighted 166. Now he weighs 142. I am very concerned because he claims that he does all of this for men to be attracted to him. Any advice is appreciated."
"Boyfriend started crying during sex


Gaybros, help me sort this mess. 

I'm dating this guy for a good six months. We're both 24 (until next month when he turns 25). I'm his first real boyfriend and the second guy he kissed ever. To be honest, you can kinda see how easy it would be for him not to fit anywhere and be apart. He's the sweetest guy on Earth. He's innocent (not gullible), and you can see wonder through his eyes, he truly marvels at the world. He will never think the worst of everyone and he *truly* feels bad about people he can't help. His sense of justice is just so perfect and he'll feel bad for like, jaywalking.


So, after months, we were talking about sex and he said he wanted to try it with me. He wanted me to be his first. I was beyond the moon. I planned the whole day. We went to the theatre (he cried so much I almost felt bad for bringing him but I SWEAR I'd never think someone could cry seeing The Little Mermaid), had a nice diner, had a hotel room set up in a romantic mood for us. 


So, there we went. We got into the mood. He is nervous by nature and shy and ashamed of his body and afraid of people leaving him, but he warmed up. We had a real blast. I read everything I could about taking someone's virginity. There was so much lube involved (perhaps even too much. Is that a thing, bottoms?). He came undone. For the first time since I've met him I couldn't see a trace of tension on his shoulders. I asked if he was fine for everything I did. We started it facing each other, but he asked me to do it from behind. I though 'ok maybe he feel better like this', so I just switched. After a while of no indication at all if he was liking it, I asked him and you know that crying voice? I was terrified. I thought I was doing something terribly wrong. I stopped and asked if he was hurting or if he wanted me to stop, but he asked me to keep going. But it was such a crying voice that it was an instant boner killer. I wanted to bury myself for hurting him so bad. When it was obvious I wasn't going to continue, he started crying even harder. I was totally lost. I asked him what was wrong and he was a total mess. He told me how he never thought someone would love him this way and yet he couldn't even enjoy it because all he could think was about what he was gonna do when I left, and started talking about how unlikeable he is and that was so wrong of me to be there and started talking things about his family and how he was bullied and depression and was basically spiralling and hyperventilating. I just stayed there and listened, because well, there wasn't much to do.


At one point, I just stopped him and reassured him of how much I loved him and that I wasn't going anywhere. I suggested a shower to calm down, but he asked to do it alone and refused to let me come in, despite asking a few times. 


We just cuddled and now he's just sleeping by my side and after giving up sleeping, I'm trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. Did I do this to him? What will I do when he wakes up? Should I just leave so he doesn't feel embarassed in the morning?"
"High School Friend Caught me with his brother


So I'm 20 and went to high school with this guy that I was friends with but not super close by any means. I went away to uni and became friends with his younger brother there (18), and we started to date casually but we decided to not tell his brother because hes not out to his family etc. So were back home for the summer and last night we went out to a club and were like dancing and stuff when his brother saw us. His brother is now super pissed that I didn't tell him and is even more mad that all his friends kept it from him just because everyone knew. Hes threathening to out my bf to his family and were honestly not sure how to handle this. Is this any of my business? Should I do something or stay out of it?"

"Thank you


This is not a question but I do want to thank you all for making my best friend happy until yesterday. He lost his battle from depression. He made a lot of friends online, especially here on this sub and wanted to thank them all. 

I am crying as I write this, as his longtime friend for 12 years since high school. I couldn‚Äôt believe he is gone because there were no signs he would do this. He was laughing and making jokes the other day. We took him to the hospital last night and was positive to save him. 

I am so sad because my best friend is a talented person who have made fan arts of Pokemon and he is really good, he finished a degree on art. He‚Äôs the sweetest guy of all my friends, he had always given me a piece of candy (believe it or not he had this small jar in his bag) when he thought I‚Äôm sad. He‚Äôs the most thoughtful person I knew. I can still remember how he gave his last allowance just to buy a complete meal for a family who‚Äôs been living in the streets, and told me not to worry, because he is more blessed than them even I knew he also had financial problems. 

I feel empty and sad because he could do more. He told me on his letter not to cry because at least now, he is guiding me from a far place. 

To all the people here, please cherish your time with your loved ones. Be grateful about everything even from the smallest things you have. Depression is real be always there for them. I feel sorry, I couldn‚Äôt be there for my friend. 

I do apologize if my English is not good, as it is not my first language. I live in the Philippines. 

Again, thank you all. "
"Banned from Pride


So I planned on going to a concert in DC for Pride. I was more interested in the concert itself than Pride, and the day before I told my mom I was going to a concert. I left out that it was associated with Pride because my family is decently homophobic. She was totally cool with it until the next morning. I was still in bed but I could hear my parents talking about the concert and Pride, and saying things like, ""Maybe he didn't know"" and ""He's influential in his group of friends. If he thinks this is okay then others will too"". I knew they were about to come in my room and question me about it before I even had the chance to wake up. My mom came in first and asked me if I knew what the concert was for and I told her of course I did; I don't go to events uninformed. My dad then came in and asked if I was okay with being associated with 'such things'. I replied that I wouldn't mind at all.

They then continued to try to wrap their head around their son wanting to go to a Pride festival. They asked if I knew what the festival even stood for. I told them that it was a celebration of the Gay Rights Movement that started to gain some swing with the Stonewall Riots. I also explained how it was a celebration of the lives lost due to discrimination and the ability to live in a world where slowly but surely people don't need to be persecuted for who they are. I was then told that even though my response sounded well informed, I was trying to justify a celebration the supported an abomination and confusion. I took the comment in stride but I wasn't even concerned with going to Pride anymore, I was legitimately upset my parents could seriously say something so callous. I continued to debate them with facts.

I brought up that my father and siblings have attended venues and events that were less than 'moral' or 'christian' and let them know that the fact that they see an issue with this was because they have an unjust bias against a group of people that was not based on equal or logical basis. They refused to accept that as a legitimate argument and told me that the only reason that I'm even arguing back is because I don't know any better and am using 'worldly wisdom'. 

My dad was concerned because he said that people associated with anything LGBT are scorned by society because they are part of a group that commits aberrant behavior. He basically said they deserved to be scorned and he didn't want me to suffer that too. But in my mind I have already suffered that hatred by being in the closet and dealing with depression for 4 years. The things that he fears will be said about me I have already suffered every time he or anyone else I know makes a homophobic comment. I have felt it already before and it doesn't hurt anymore to take other people's crap and prejudice. And I really wanted to tell them that if they were worried about me facing discrimination just for supporting gays, then why not try to stop the hatred with themselves instead of feeding it.

I love my family enough where I dropped the argument knowing that everything I said was valid and they never could truly retort any of it unless they crawled back to scripture which is not  a valid basis to begin with. i just told them I'm not going only because they said no, but not because its going to hurt me. Also I had to do a full on debate with my whole family (6 people)while still in bed.

They know they did not change my mind  and things seem a bit rocky now, but I'm sure I rocked their 'safe' world where all their kids are straight and fear gays like them. I will continue to stand up for what is right and I will exposed hatred at its core. \*Rant over\* 

TLDR: Family banned me from going to pride and I argued them down until they couldn't really do anything but use the bible to cover the fact that they are afraid of gays and their son being associated with 'those people'"
"This makes me sad


Some LGBT activists don't think cops should be able to march at Pride parades, even if they're LGBT themselves. Apparently it doesn't matter that if anything were to go wrong with all the people coming out to support Pride, they'd be the first ones rushing to the scene.


Shouldn't Pride be about coming together instead of more division? These LGBT activists don't speak for all of us because I personally believe we should embrace the police with open arms at Pride, especially the LGBT cops.

"My dad and my brother


Yesterday I was walking home from the train station( I was away for school for some time and that is the area of our old house where my mom and I used to live before my parents separated because of me being gay. And I accidentally stumbled upon my brother and my dad. They just looked at me and turned their heads and pretended not to know me and passed by me without saying a word. Their faces were stone cold. I broke down crying in the middle of the street. I miss them so much every day and they don't even care if I exist."
"Anyone else get nervous around other gay guys?


I'm 20 and all my friends are either girls or straight guys, recently ive notice that I get nervous around openly gay/confident gay guys. Not even necessarily ones I find attractive. I'm not socially awkward or anything but something about it makes me nervous. I'm out and open so I don't think that's it. Anyone else feel this way? Is it something that ill eventually work through?"
