"UPDATE: My [20/F] boyfriend [23/M] is extremely stressed studying for the MCAT and has been really distant. The only thing he seems to want from me right now is sex—I feel used.


[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zr8h1/my_20f_boyfriend_24m_is_extremely_stressed/)

First of all, thank you so much to everyone who shared their own experiences with the MCAT and sympathized with both me and my boyfriend. Reading those definitely gave me more perspective while making me feel more understood. Also, thanks to everyone who gave me great advice (I tried to follow a lot of it!).


As I mentioned in my previous post, my boyfriend is taking the MCAT in August. Well, he just took it two days ago, on August 3rd and he said it went extremely well. I could tell it went well right after I saw his face—he couldn't stop smiling! Yay!


I know a lot of you guys suggested that we should have a serious sit-down conversation about his studying habits and how it made me feel after the MCAT and I promised that I would but it ended happening before the MCAT, which is not what I wanted to happen at all. Basically about two weeks before the test date, my boyfriend was still the same: studying endlessly in either his dorm or the library. As a lot of you suggested, despite the fact that it's him inviting me over to his dorm, I should just stop going since I'm wasting my time there. So I'd basically stop coming over and I didn't think he minded until I was forced to stop by dorm because I realized I forgot my sketchbook there from like a week ago. Shit. Well, I called him, told him I was coming by to pick up my sketchbook and he said sure.


After I retrieved and had one foot out the door, he asked me if I wanted to stay for a bit. I told him no thanks and he asked, ""How come you never come by anymore? I miss you being here..."" After he said that, I felt angry, sad, and conflicted all at the same time. I was still feeling pretty hurt and used because of his actions so I kind of just let my thoughts go and told him everything. I told him how I felt hurt everytime he asked me to come but would just ignore me. I told him how sex wasn't that enjoyable for me anymore and basically all of my frustrations. I kept my cool, didn't raise my voice, and really tried to not blame him.


To my utmost shock and surprise, he looked at me for like ten seconds then began to cry. His eyes got all watery and red and then he turned away and basically cried into his arms. He then started to mumble apologies through tears. I was so shocked that I didn't do anything but watch for a good 30 seconds but then regained my composure and rushed to comfort him. He told me through tears that he was so sorry and that he realized what he was doing but felt like he couldn't stop and was losing control. He felt like he was losing me and his asking me to come over even though he knew I couldn't help was his way of trying to show me he still cared during this time. He said he knew it wasn't working but he felt really lost of just so so stressed. He kept apologizing through tears and saying that he didn't mean to treat me like shit and make me feel used. He promised me that he'd stop his endless studying and make time to spend quality time with me.


About one minute into his apologies, I start crying too. It felt damn good to cry. I told him that it was okay and that I understood. After ten more minutes of me me just holding him, he asked me if I wanted to go get ice cream with him (it was like 11pm by then). I say yes and he drives me 20 miles to a little dingy ice cream shop (it was the only one open) and we sit and just eat ice cream. This was when I suggested that maybe to help with the stress of his studying, we could exercise together (thanks to the person who suggested this in my last post). He said that it sounded like a great idea. I also told him that it might be good for us to hang out once or twice a week for a couple of hours, no studying or talking about the MCAT. He happily agreed.


It worked out really well. For the next two weeks leading up to his exam, we went out running every single day in the evening for 45 minutes. The weekend before his exam, he took me to the beach and we had a great time there. We also went and say the Incredibles 2 and had a few quality dinner dates. He seemed happier and I was definitely happier.
Since I was no longer going to his dorm, I also took your guys' advice on spending more time with my friends. So for four days, me and a couple of my close girlfriends took a camping/hiking trip to a national park which was really fun. I was also very productive and finally launched the website for a non-profit that I started.


The MCAT was two days ago, as I said. Boyfriend is now stress-free (at least for now haha) and we're spending lots of quality time together. He's not even worried about his score because he's so confident. Anyway, life's good.


TL;DR: Told my boyfriend that I felt used after he asked me why I wasn't coming over anymore. He cried like a baby and apologized for half an hour. I forgave him and the next two weeks were a huge improvement. Boyfriend also just took the August 3rd MCAT and is pretty sure he got full marks."
"UPDATE: My (29F) husband's (29M) new coworker (26F) has a crush on him, he isn't interested in her, but doesn't see anything wrong with hanging out with her at or outside of work.


Here's my original post.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92h9kb/my\_29f\_husbands\_29m\_new\_coworker\_26f\_has\_a\_crush/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92h9kb/my_29f_husbands_29m_new_coworker_26f_has_a_crush/)

**tl/dr: My husband thought having a platonic relationship with a coworker who wanted a romantic relationship was okay. He announced I was pregnant at work, she got angry, and he realized she was so upset because it wasn't just a friendship to her. We discussed why I was so upset and felt disrespected about their friendship, and he said he gets it now, apologized to me, and now we're better and taking a kid free trip to Las Vegas later this month.**

I tried talking to him about the relationship with Maria soon after I posted that. I told him I'm extremely uncomfortable with him getting closer to her, and he said I don't need to worry, he's used to getting a lot of attention from women so he's ignoring it. So I said that wasn't good enough for me. He was quiet for a second but handed me his phone and said I could look through all 4 months of texts, and they were all work related except for 2 about lunch, which I knew about.

A couple days ago, he got off of work early because I'm pregnant, and he wanted to come to my prenatal visit. He walked in the house, and as soon as he saw me, he started telling me what happened at work that day.

He hadn't told everyone at work I was pregnant yet, so I left it up to him to decide when to tell everyone else. He announced to everyone in the hangar (he's in the Marines and does aircraft maintenance) that we were expecting our 4th child, so that's why he was going to be getting off early to go to a prenatal visit. Everyone congratulated him or made jokes- except for Maria. She was excited to see him and was talking his ear off while they were fixing something, but as soon as she heard we were expecting, she got angry, got an attitude when he asked her to grab a part for him, and spent the rest of the day avoiding him. Their other coworkers noticed this too.

He said he was honestly confused at first, and he thought ""Why is she mad? It's not like we're together, I'm married and she knows this."" But then it hit him that this wasn't just a friendship to her, and that even though he didn't intend to, he had crossed a line. He kept going back over the past 4 months in his head, wondering what he said and did to let this happen, because he felt like he had treated her like his other friends. And said he knew there were things he shouldn't talk about with her- he never talked about our marital problems-, because he knew confiding in someone like that could lead to problems, and he never touched her, not even a handshake or hug, because he didn't want to lead her on. 

Then I showed him the comments on my post. We discussed boundaries and comment about how relationships are based on the intent of both parties- that a friendship is when two people agree to be platonic, but with Maria, he may think they're friend's, but obviously Maria wants more. So if only one person thinks its a friendship, then it's NOT a friendship. He agreed with that, said it made sense, and he's sorry he didn't think of that on his own. He also said he sees how it could appear to be the beginnings of an emotional affair, but promised it wasn't one, he was just an idiot who thought it was possible to be friends with someone who wanted a romantic relationship if he just ignored that part.

I told him I just felt extremely disrespected, especially since he had invited her to our house for a barbecue we are having, and our children and friends/coworkers will be there. He just kept apologizing, and said at the time he didn't fully understand why I was upset because she was just a friend to him, but now he gets it, and she's not invited anymore.

Then he said should have known a friendship can't work if only one person thinks they're friends, apologized for not listening to me and for naively thinking he had everything under control, promised it wouldn't happened again, and said he loved me. We had to leave for my appointment then, but decided in the car that sometime in the next month, we're taking a kid free trip somewhere.

He texted Maria that night that he wanted to keep their relationship professional, which she didn't take so well, so work for him has been interesting for the past couple days, but he said as long as our marriage is strong and I'm happy, he's okay with that.  He's planned a date night for this weekend, and his mom's flying in from Norway this month to watch our 3 girls while we go to Las Vegas. So everything is good now. :)"
"My [28/F] friend [41/F] announced she is getting married next week. I have reason to believe she is lying.


Wendy and I have been friends for several years. We used to live in the same city and see one another often. I knew she had a history of traumatic relationships and had hence decided not to date, but I also knew she had a pretty intense crush on a friend of a friend I had never met, James.

When I moved to another state, we stayed in touch via phone calls. She told me that her feelings for James were becoming stronger, despite the fact that they had no contact. Soon, she began telling me that they were in love but his ex-girlfriend was preventing them from being together. Because these conversations became so odd, I stopped the calls and stepped away from the friendship. 

This week, I visited my former city on an impromptu trip and met up with Wendy. She told me the exciting news that her and James were finally getting married after this ex had kept them apart so long. She showed me photos of a home he bought her, of horses he bought her, and of her in a wedding dress. She told me the name of the venue and invited me. Then she dropped the bombshell that James is apparently a millionaire. 

All of this seemed off to me and when I got home, my concerns mounted. Her house was not packed despite the fact she is supposedly moving imminently. Money seems tight for her, she is living in relative squalor, if she has a millionaire fiance, why isn't he helping her? 

I did some digging. I found the house she showed me on Zillow, still for sale. I found the horses on a website for a local ranch that does tours. I called the venue and they told me they are unbooked on the supposed wedding date. All the available evidence tells me that she is not getting married. My gut tells me that her and James are not even in a relationship or have any contact. 

I don't know what to do next. Do I confront her? Do I warn James? Are these simply lies or are they delusions and the symptom of a serious mental illness? How do I help her?

TLl;DR: My friend claims to be getting married, all evidence points to that being a lie or delusion. "
"Boyfriend [18M] says it's unfair/sexist that I'm [18F] getting an old car from my family when my siblings got it when the car was newer, and I should say something. I'm just happy that I'm getting something.


So when my brother was 18 my parents bought him a new car (Honda civic), it was 8 years ago. When my sister turned 18 (5 years later) he bought another car for himself and passed this onto our sister, who after 3 years got a car for herself and passed this one onto me.

My boyfriend says this is evidence for favoritism by my parents that I'm getting a used car with 100K miles while it was a new car when my brother used it. He also says it's sexist because brother got a new car while it was passed onto me and my sister.

I'm honestly just happy that I don't need to buy a car and I can drive this one while in college. Many kids my age don't get anything from their families so I appreciate them doing this for me and I actually don't care that it's a car that was passed onto me by siblings. It's just the order of birth and older siblings always pass their stuff to you as you all get older, isn't that just a rule of life?

I think my boyfriend acts in a very entitled way and I don't like this. Is this an incompatibility between us? Or just different families? He's an only child so I guess he always got new stuff from parents.

TL;DR: Boyfriend says it's unfair and sexist that the old car that my siblings used is passed onto me and I should say something to my parents. I think that's entitled. Is this a fundamental difference and incompatibility?"
"[UPDATE] My (26) boyfriend told me he (27) likes another girl, and I don't know what to do


Heres the old post: https://redd.it/8wmebz

So, well I suppose this experience has become a learning curve, obviously I had to make a fool of myself to get here. So I ended flying out there, I was suppose to anyway around this time, I guess this just sort of rushed it. He was going to have a house part on Saturday, I was there of course and well she came too. I was told they did not hang out after my chat with her which I believed cause she showed me the messages anyway. 

AT THE PARTY: So she came at around 9pm and some one announced she was here “X is here” and I could immediately see my boyfriends eyes looking for her. Yes she is a very beautiful girl, and every one seems to revolve around her, but she her self was very timid. For the whole night from her side I did not see any advances, she came and said hello to my boyfriend and then said hello to me too and then went around doing what people do at parties drinking, talking etc. My boyfriend on the other hand couldn’t keep away, if she went to the kitchen to get a drink, he would be there, if she went to talk so some one after a while he would be there, if she dropped something he would run to the other side of the room to pick it up, and if he did not see her for a while he would run around looking for her. He was trying to be discrete obviously, but no, it was obvious not just to me but to every one. He would makes jokes at her etc, they seem to have a jokey sort of friendship/relationship where they make fun of each other. As for me, I went pretty unnoticed once she basically came, infact she was probably more attentive towards me than he was. I felt shit and embarrassed. She is all he can see. Anyway she was leaving at 12 cause apparently she lives far and that’s the last bus. This was the last stab in the heart, she said “Alright good bye guys” and my boyfriend holds her by the arms and says “you’re going already?” she looks straight at me, and I just leave the room. SHE follows me out and apologises, I am crying at this point. She says shes sorry, at this point I am wondering why isn’t my boyfriend doing this. As I am about to say anything my boyfriend comes out and asks if he can walk her to the bus stop, and then notices I am crying and keeps asking whats wrong. I’ve had enough, so I just go to bed at this point as I am a bit drunk and sober.

NEXT DAY: He basically admits to me that he thinks she is the one and he is in love with her, he has apparently never enjoyed any ones company so much, she gets him gets all his engineering jokes blah blah and went on a rant about how she is everything he wanted. I ask him where does this leave us? He doesn’t respond, I just tell him I am going back home and he can talk to me when he figures out what he wants. This was almost 3 weeks ago and he hasn’t said anything to me. So I guess has decided what he wants. 
Thank you for your help guys, I did lose it for it a bit, I did not expect this and did not know what to do. But I think I’ve learned my lesson.

  **tl;dr**:went to see him, said he loves her, hasnt spoken to me since. "
"UPDATE: My boss (24M) is dating my ex (19F) and now I (19M) feel so uncomfortable and insecure at work.


[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92wuub/my_boss_24m_is_dating_my_ex_19f_and_now_i_19m/)

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice on my first post. For the past week, I've been trying to focus on myself and my work and not care about my ex and my boss who's dating her. It worked pretty well, I started a painting and I'm pretty close to finishing it and I impressed my boss boss (the one who owns the lab, not the one dating my ex) by staying late for two days in a row to finish a really difficult experiment. During our lab meeting, my boss boss shouted me out in front of the entire lab and said he was really impressed by my hard-work and dedication. That felt good.

As for the situation with my boss and my ex, he found out. Like I mentioned in my previous post, when my ex told me who her new boyfriend was, I didn't mention that he was my boss so neither of them knew. Two days ago, my boss and us (couple of undergrads who work under him) were in a conference room discussing a paper when my ex came in. She came to drop off my boss's wallet that I think he forgot or something. Anyway, she saw me, did a double-take and went, ""Jaaaake?!"". She was definitely super surprised and caught off-guard and her boss was already like ""wtf"" so I was just like, ""heeeyy 'Sarah'"". She shot me another shocked wide-eyed look and left. Suffice to say the rest of the meeting was pretty awkward. 

The next day, it was obvious that my boss now knew our history. Things just turned so awkward. Like he didn't now how to act around me anymore and what to say. Now we were both awkward around each other. He's still nice and all but things are just uncomfortable between us two now. It's not his fault though. I think that things will get better between the two of us but as of right now, I actually feel kind of relieved that he now knows. Something about how both of us now don't know how to act and what to do kind of makes me feel reassured.

But if things continue to remain really awkward to the point where both of our work is affected, I'll consider talking to my boss boss about switching me to work under another grad student instead. 

But yea, that's about all. Again, thanks for the help guys.

TL;DR: Been focusing on myself and my work. Boss found out that I'm his girlfriend's ex and things are now awkward but bearable.

"Update ""Me [27 F] heartbroken after my [26 M] boyfriend of 6 years backs out of planned proposal""

3 months later and we have decided to end our relationship. We officially broke up a few weeks ago, and he moved his furniture out of our apartment this week.

I received incredibly varied advice from my original post. I took all of it into consideration, and let him read the post as well.

We tried our very best over the last few months to move past this, but we were not able to. Breaking up seemed like the only option left.

To all of you that told me that he wanted to be with me, but didn't want to get married, you were right. I didn't want to believe it, but after months of circular conversations, it came back every time. He just didn't want to get married, he didn't feel like he was ready, and he didn't know when he would be.

Basically I wanted to post an update on this thread because I needed to get it off my chest. I always figured that maybe some of you were in similar situations and you were hoping to eventually hear the outcome.

Thank you to everyone who had originally commented on my post! You definitely gave me a lot to think about.

"My(F18) father died and my best friend doesn't care


My father was diagnosed with lung cancer 11 months ago. This was a very hard time, my father and I were close and it was just horrible to see him this sick.

My best friend and I are friends since we were both 4 years old. I thought real, lifelong friends.

 My best friend was on a trip in New-Zealand for most of the time when my father was ill. She did not have much internet access so we did not speak much. I informed her about my dad often but since there were some internet problems we didn't talk much.

My father died 1.5 months ago. My best friend was back in the country for a month when it happend. 

Her reaction when I told about the passing; omgg i am so sorry are you ok? I said; well, not too well but what can i do.. I was obviously very sad. She then started talking about a fight she had with a friend of her.

I was quite shocked but just talked along with her.

My father had a small funeral, only the closest family members were allowed.
After the convo where I told my friend that he passed; she never asked about him again.

This is 1.5 month ago. Not once did she ask about the funeral, how I feel, nothing.
I am so baffled and sad. I always have her back when she had troubles. Now I feel like she does not care at all. What can  I do? 

**TL;DR my father died and my best friend doesn't seem to care. It hurts. **"
"My (30f) husband (36m) has gone on a chore strike


My husband and I have been married for 6 years. We both work and have usually done a decent job of dividing the chores. I am 7 months pregnant with our first child.

Since becoming pregnant, certain chores have become really tough for me. For example, I have a lot of trouble doing the laundry because I can't bend/lift like I used to. I also struggle with things like cleaning the bathroom because I have to get down on the floor. The doctor has recommended that I cut way back on physical activity as it is.

I sat down with my husband and told him that we need to redistribute the chores and he got very upset. He said that I'm using the pregnancy as an excuse to be lazy and that he shouldn't have to do my chores. I suggested that we swap some chores because his usual chores (cooking, doing dishes) would be much easier for me to handle. He refuses to listen and said that he likes his chores and doesn't want to do mine.

Now I am trying to keep up with my responsibilities but have been falling short. My husband decided that since I'm not doing my half of the chores, he won't do his. Now I feel like I have to do all the essential housework because he refuses to take care of himself, me, or the house. With this on top of the job and the pregnancy, I'm not sure how much more I can handle. How can I address this and help him see how unreasonable he's being?

*TLDR* my husband refuses to swap chores to accommodate my pregnancy and now won't do chores at all"
"Partner (33F) and I (24F), together almost 3 years. We're talking marriage, but my parents (50's) still politely refuse to meet her.


I'm seeking some advice about navigating a complex family dynamic while trying to understand my own wants and desires. 

Sam (alias) and I are happy. My family is happy. But my family has no desire to meet or interact with Sam, and Sam is no stranger to familial neglect. As she only maintains a relationship with her sister who lives out of state, she is content with our urban, queer nuclear family (two moms, a pupper and cat.)

I could get into Sam's family history (and type furiously) but suffice it to say, she is a success story in SPITE of her mother and extended family. Naturally, she's not keen on ""family"" and had a lot of hesitation surrounding marriage in the first place. We've been seeing a couple's therapist to set up our relationship with a strong foundation and work out any issues before the big C. (*Commiiiitment*)


I had the opposite experience growing up. Had it not been for my family's attention and care, I would not be half the woman I am today. The reason I am able to communicate with you all is because of the sacrifices my parents made to ensure we moved to a country with better economic opportunities. We're immigrants from a small latin country-- family is everything.  

Of course there's tension because I'm queerful, but it's been 6 years since the other big C (*cooming oouut*) and my parents have grown more tolerant. My partner never comes up in conversation nor do they inquire about my personal life. They know of her, know we bought a house and raised a dog (they love the dog) but they're always side stepping calling her my SO. Occasionally, my mother humors me when I talk about her, but she's not  enthused. It may not be the right time, but I at least have been pushing for Sam to join the family for Christmas. No promises were made, just hand wavy maybes.

Sam would like to be included, in the sort of way someone entertains fanciful fantasies. She wants to impress my family, hang out with my sisters (they have come to the house once before. They're supportive.) However, she is fine waiting until they're more receptive.

Am I pushing too much? Am I not pushing enough? Is there a timeline with these things, or an order of operations? I don't want to put wedding plans on hold because my family hasn't exactly gotten to know the bride yet. Sam isn't crazy about weddings anyway.

The big kicker is telling my parents about getting hitched. The even bigger kicker is having to tell my Dad we're doing a post-nup (like a pre-nup, but after the wedding.) Can't avoid that one since I'm going to need his access to a lawyer.

How do I work up the courage to ask for respect and inclusion? 

Thanks so much in advance. 

TL;DR You don't have to be gay to understand how upsetting it can be to know your relationship will never be celebrated by your parents."
"I [20sF] complained about my neighbor [50/60s M], then he screamed at me in the hallway. I feel trapped in my apartment.


So I moved into a new apartment in February in a small building. Everyone in the building has kept to themselves except my downstairs neighbor. He is always hanging out outside the building, would always talk to me when I took my dog out. At first I thought it was nice, then he asked me some questions I thought were kind of inappropriate. Then he made some racist comments to me. So I was already not a fan of his. 

Every day when I come home from work, he is already there, sitting outside, blasting music from inside his apartment. Luckily, the walls are decent enough where I can't usually hear the music but the bass thumps a lot. It goes on for 2 or 3 hours and it gives me a headache. I'd tried to ask him multiple times to turn the bass down. But nothing ever changed. 

I finally had it when it had been going on from 10am to 7pm on a weekend. I want to enjoy my apartment too! I emailed the property managers and asked that they speak to him about the bass. For one week it was blissfully bass-free. 

Then two days ago it was so loud it rattled my windows and dishes. I took my dog outside to get away from it for a minute and contemplate what to do. When I came back in the front door, my neighbor was waiting for me in the doorway. He started questioning me about calling management, telling me I knew about the noise before I moved in, how he never played it when I'm home because he looks for my car, started raising his voice about me be a troublemaker, causing trouble, starting sh*t. I just started walking away at that point because I wasn't about to be yelled at. He yelled after me that if I didn't like it I could get the f*ck out. I reported that to management too. 

Now the music happens every day again. I come home from work and sit in my apartment listening to this pounding bass. I don't feel like I should have to leave my apartment to escape it and I can't take my dog everywhere either. 

I really don't know what to do. It's not always loud enough to pick up the bass sounds on my phone and I can't afford to break the lease. I'm also kind of scared of this guy now. He's always outside the building, I'm afraid to even walk in and out the front door. I try to wait until I know he's not there but I can't live like this. 

If anyone has any ideas about 1) the noise and 2) not being terrified of this man please let me know. 

Tl;dr I made a complaint about my neighbor's bass-heavy music to my apartment manager. The neighbor screamed at me and plays even louder now. I'm a little scared and also my brain hurts. "
"Update: I (17f) recently became aware that my mom (46f) is an awful jealous stepmom


[link to last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mt8el/i_17f_have_recently_become_aware_that_my_mom_46f/)

My sister (23f now) hasn’t come back home since the last time. (My last post) I (18f!) don’t think she ever will. I don’t know if it ever really felt like home for her or just some place she was stuck in for years. She doesn’t really talk to our dad anymore either. She speaks to him about us, and sets up times for us to visit her. She graduated from university back in June (I graduated from HS in May, and am going to a state school here in Texas) and invited me and my brothers but told my dad, she didn’t want him or my mom there. My dad still bought us tickets to go and see her though. The 2 weeks we got to spend with her was so much fun.


Her birthday was back in the beginning of July and her girlfriend proposed... so she’s engaged now. Which is cool but trippy! My sister is engaged y’all! Just thought I’d give you an overall update on her life now. She’s doing good but she still hates my mom (I don’t blame her) and has cut our dad out as much as possible. If any of you read my last post, thanks for urging me to reach out to her.

TLDR: sister is living her best life free from my mom and dad"

Original post here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92emym/my\_27f\_bf\_27m\_of\_7\_years\_resists\_progression\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92emym/my_27f_bf_27m_of_7_years_resists_progression_of/) 

Thanks to everyone who commented and shared their thoughts. It made me realize how obvious the imbalance was and how one sided the relationship was in certain dimensions. Sure, he loves me and contributes in ways that make it seem like the day to day living of our relationship is healthy and balanced. But at the core of things, as one redditor put it, I'm not a ""hell-yes"" to him. I wanted to share an update for those who helped and let you know how the past 2 days have been. I hope my experience helps others who are in similar circumstances - I know reading similar posts have helped me. 

I didn't include in my original post a separate breaking point we experienced that becomes relevant below - at one point I had serious doubts about our relationship (near the end of my ""cool girl"" phase, being sick of pretending to be someone else) and seriously idealized the fantasy of being with someone else who would treat me better. I imagined everyone being an amazing boyfriend - strangers, people I knew, acquaintances - I would think ""I wonder if they could make me happy"". I got infatuated crushes like crazy. He noticed the difference and thought I was cheating. I came clean and we discussed it and he was seriously hurt that I'd had these thoughts. We were moving forward when I got seriously wasted one night and made out with a girl friend of mine. I didn't tell him for 6 months. When I did come clean, it was because he thought I was cheating. During the time I kept this secret I experienced some serious guilt and darkness and used substances as a crutch. It was a really low point. Since that time I've gotten control of my drinking and all consumables and have worked on communicating my feelings to avoid these inevitable burn-outs that result from ""cool girling"" or rug sweeping.  I really thought we were making progress together and strengthening our foundation while also nurturing his healing. I know forgiveness and trust take time and I felt willing to put the time in because we wanted the same things in life. 

When I wrote the original post, I was at work on Friday. His ""dont eff me over"" comment was over the phone, after we realized that ownership had to be in my name to save on financing. For the past three days the arguments have continued and I've stuck my ground and made my points known consistently. I'm honestly having a hard time walking away but trying to be strong while I make arrangements. 

After our phone call on Friday, he knew I was upset, and I think he was expecting a bad mood or an argument when I got home. Luckily, I'd been able to read a couple of your comments which helped reaffirm my feelings and solidified my argument, with statements put more eloquently than I could.  It feels like a blur now but I remember saying how the comment was unnecessary and hurtful; he knows I dont like it, so why does he continue to say it? I understand protecting yourself but the proper way to protect yourself is having affairs in order, etc. not saying unproductive hurtful comments. I said it was just another action that demonstrated how his fear of ""being effed over"" overode his excitement for this next step together. I told him that I was excited to buy this car together because it seemed like the first thing we did together where we considered our problem as a team and came up with a mutually beneficial arrangement that wasn't exactly 50/50 because we were working towards a common goal. He thought I was excited about the car because I was somehow getting the upperhand on him.  I said he has always resisted this (the shared credit card, the benefits, referring to each other as common law, talking about marriage /kids) and all that said to me was that he isn't serious about us or building a future together. I said I was ready for this and excited to, and he just resists and it makes me so sad. He basically doubled down and used a similar discourse from the past - he doesn't know what he'll want in the future, if he wants to be married, or if he wants kids. I should be happy with what we have. Some other highlights of the conversation included how it isn't his job to make he happy; I'm emotionally unstable; look at how quickly I reacted to his comment, thus proving in intent to ""eff him over""; I'm like all other woman searching after some fairy tale that doesn't exist, etc. As bad as this sounds, it was a level conversation of back and forth and when we both finished talking we were silent for the rest of the night - it wasn't some crazy fighting match. 

Saturday we had to go and pick up the car at 9:30. At 8 pm we still hadn't sent over the banking information and I said we should talk about it to decide.  He said we would decide when we got there (?) which makes no sense. I had my banking info with me, so I didn't resist. The original compromise we came up with, had me paying $10K of $18K in cash to him directly, with him taking the payments into his name at 0% finance and ownership in my name. Originally we intended to buy a car in cash, but opted to take 0% financing. Since I would be using the car more, have it in my name, and enjoy the gas savings more (since he was unwilling to get a shared credit card, to enjoy pooled shared savings), I agreed to pay out 10K for the car for him to use against other vehicle debt he was paying 4% interest on. When we got to the car dealership I said we would put it all in my name. I said, thinking like he was about protecting himself, if we broke up it would be hard to get that 10K back from him - so it only makes sense to protect myself. He said ""oh now you're thinking like this eh? Well I'm out then, I'm not going to be a part of this - this can be your car"", and I replied ""well apparently I have to think like this. That's fine. I'm going to pay you out for the rest of our lease and I'm moving out"". He was kind of shocked. This is all in the car dealers office lol. The dealer comes in and we act normal - he says financing can't remove his name because we would have to rewrite the whole deal. I plan on calling the finance office on Monday to switch it over to get his name off of everything. That night I said to him, ""I can see how you would think this was a drastic reaction to your one comment - but it's not just that comment. It's the way I've been feeling about all of these other things and this was the straw the broke the camels back. It feels awful to know that you're more invested than your partner and I deserve to be with someone who is enthusiastic and excited to be in love with me.""  He said choosing to live life with me is a commitment, and he's obviously committed to me because he's been with me 7 years. I said every commitment you make has no risk, they're all superficial.  You can't even prove your committed to me by giving me your word. 

Today was another round of arguments. He still doesn't think I'm serious.  He asked why I was distant in the morning and I said I'm still thinking about everything from the past 2 days. Highlights of the conversation include - he'll never forgive me for cheating, and he doesn't trust me. He thinks I'm being irrational and throwing away a good thing. That I should continue as we are, living in the moment. I said I'm afraid of wasting my time with him, when he clearly doesn't want what I want from this relationship. I have reiterated again and again - I want to be with someone who is excited to commit to me. Who knows he wants to marry me after 7 years (even with our challenges), and can tell me he want children. This is the bottom line. He says marriage doesnt matter; this argument isn't going to force him to feel differently; why am I being so crazy. I never issued an ultimatum because as you all pointed out - there is no point. I said I'm not trying to force him into anything and everything he says just reinforces that this is the right choice. He thinks I should take my time deciding because he thinks I'm being rash; I told him I don't want to be sucked back into what is comfortable because it would be easy.  Finally, he said ""you know whats funny? at the end of all this I'm still getting effed."" and I replied ""how exactly are you getting effed? I'm paying you out for the lease and your name will be off the car loan - your fear of being effed is going to eff you so much more than any person could. You expect the worst from people and thats all you're going to get, because it's what you give. I dont know why you're letting some experience from 10 years ago damage you so badly. I'm willing to be open and vulnerable with you and you can't reciprocate that. You're never going to experience true love unless you are willing to open up"". 

It's hard to resist - but I'm trying to be strong. When I feel myself thinking about making it work - I realize that all of the reasons why I want to are for him - to make him happy - something he isn't willing to do for me. His comments take the air from my lungs and make it so hard to stand up to him but I know in my gut that THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANT IN A RELATIONSHIP.  I guess writing all of this out helps me realize this more and more. Instead of hearing me and wanting to help, he invalidates my feelings and says I don't even know what I'm talking about or I read too much on the internet (he mocks me for reading r/relationships . Honestly this forum has made me take off the rose tints to see red flags for what they are. I'm going to pay him out for the lease and take my time to find a good living arrangement. I know there will be more blow-outs in the coming weeks and I'm hoping to maintain a strong resolve. Thank you all for reading. 

tl;dr - getting there. trying to wade through my emotions with a strong head, while listening to my gut. This car has been a god send. I can't imagine trying to disentangle a home, or a family.  "
"UPDATE: My [20s] half-sibling [9] keeps trying to video call me and I don’t feel comfortable


[removed]"
"I [22 F] found out I was his [28 M] side piece. I spitefully left photos of us camping together up on social media, that he didn't want up.




For a while, it seemed like this guy Ralph who comes by my work was flirting with me. I decided to give it a chance, we've gone out to drinks a few times, and just last weekend, we went camping. We didn't have sex, but we did fool around in the tent. 

I put some artsy photos on Instagram, afterwards. One of the mountains, one of a lake, and one of a pretty salamander in Ralph's hands (His face wasn't in the picture, just his hands, but he has some scars on his hands that are pretty distinctive). I tagged him in them, not thinking it would be a big deal. I knew he wasn't private about social media (He's always on Snapchat and Instagram), and the pictures were pretty innofensive.

He texted me to take them down, I got that text the next afternoon because I'd been sleeping in. I had also gotten a text from my friend Julie at the same time, with a screenshot of a girl's Facebook profile, with loads of coupley pictures with Ralph. Up through when I'd been seeing him. She asked if it was the guy I've been seeing.

I went on Facebook to look for myself. I didn't see any pictures with her on his timeline (Maybe he selectively hid them from me? Or just didn't have them up there?) But I looked her up, and it was all there.

I was furious, I was really into him and he was treating me like a side piece. It pissed me off that he asked me to remove the photos, and he probably wouldn't have been honest if I asked why. He'd pretended to be single up till now.

So I didn't reply to his text, and I also put the same photo album on Facebook, plus a picture of him shirtless, making breakfast on the grill, and tagged him so it would show up on his profile. It was kinda spiteful, I know.

He texted me a few hours later saying that he told me to take the first photo down, and I added more? And to take them all down right away. 

I replied ""oops i missed ur text this morning"" and ""OK, will do."" Then I just didn't do it.

He texted me a bunch more times, saying he likes to keep his personal life off Facebook, it was kinda cringy I was posting this stuff after just a few dates, that he was untagging himself but it was already awkward because his friends and family had seen it and ""were asking questions"" etc. He never said he was cheating, but his texts alone made it obvious. I didn't reply to any of it. 

I kinda want to just ghost him and leave the camping photos up, to spite him. Julie told me she thinks that would be hilarious, leaving him not knowing what I know, and not being able to get the pictures taken down. But I'm also tempted to tell him off to his face so he knows how shitty he was being.

TLDR - I found out I'm the side piece. Should I ghost, or tell the guy off?

"My girlfriend [30F] always expects presents on holidays, her birthday, and other occasions, but does not give me [27M] presents beyond sex. Am I right to feel that this is a little unfair?


Hi Reddit, My girlfriend ""Carli"" and I have been together about three years. I am a graphic designer; she works as a cashier in a vintage clothing store. 

Due to a particular leasing problem she has with her landlord and existing roommates (2 other women), we have scheduled moving in together in January '19.

I consider Carli to be a serious girlfriend, and I will very likely propose marriage to her in the near future, a fact about which Carli is aware and agreeable to.

Carli is really big on her personal milestones. If it's her birthday or she has some other personal, life even, she'll want me to commemorate it by giving her a present. If it's a shared milestone, such as an anniversary, she will also expect a present. And if it's Valentine's Day, Christmas, or any other holiday, she definitely expects a present.

I know she expects a present, because I see how she behaves when she DOESN'T get a present (sulking, moping, guilting, etc). I'm not monetarily struggling, so spending some money to keep Carli happy is not financially draining, at least not yet.

However, I notice on that Carli does not get gifts for me on my own birthday, and while she will give me a gift at Christmas, she does not give me presents on other holidays such as Valentines Day. Nor will she give me presents on our shared milestones.

What she will do instead, is just make sure that we have sex that day. As if it's a present, and we didn't just have sex three or four other times this same week and those weren't holidays at all.

Am I right to feel a little bit annoyed by the double standard here?

Or should I just chalk this up to, well she's a girl and I'm a guy and girls and guys are different?

I wouldn't be asking, except she just gets really entitled when it comes to her getting gifts, but doesn't seem to think I should be recognized even remotely in the same way except through sex.

I don't think giving your partner sex should be a gift or conditional to holidays.

Also I think it's unfair that whenever there's a holiday I'm racking my brain trying to be considerate and personal and creative and fun with my gift-giving ideas, meanwhile, in comparison all she has to do is lay on her back and think of England.

\*\*tl;dr: girlfriend expects gifts on every occasion. On those same occasions, she thinks the only ""gift"" she needs to give me is sex. Am I right to think this is unfair?\*\*"
"Boyfriend (30M, 2 years) inviting other woman (29F) to be wedding date because I (27F) might be unavailable


My boyfriend, long-term live-in, is acting as the best man in his college friends wedding at the end of September. I've spent quite a bit of time with his friends that are getting married and we all always have a good time hanging out. 

I just got a job offer that would take me a few hours out of town and would be a huge, positive career move that I'm in no position to turn down, but they've requested me to start mid-September and weren't amenable to pushing the start date back at all. I've been applying for new jobs for months and was up-front with BF and his friends that I may not be able to attend their wedding if things worked out with one of the jobs, they understood and were excited for me.

This weekend, a few days post job offer he told me he's going to invite his friend (29F) who has never met the couple to the wedding because I might not be able to come up for the weekend right after moving and starting a new job (there are some weekend hours involved, I should find out a solid schedule in the next few weeks). I told him this would hurt me and we didn't even know yet if I could make it and he responded that they've already submitted a final headcount to their caterer so he has to invite someone. 

On top of this, he might be unexpectedly missing my friends wedding in a few weeks and I never considered finding a replacement date -- I communicated with my friend and she told me to let them know a week in advance before they finalized their headcount. 

I don't know how to proceed -- he seems to not understand at all how this could be hurtful, I feel very written off before I've even left. Is it fair to feel like he's walking back our relationship or am I being controlling by asking him not to bring another date?

Tldr: boyfriend invited someone else to be his wedding date two months in advance because I might be unavailable, gives flimsy excuse about maintaining headcount and ignores me being hurt by it. Wtf?"
"My (27M) girlfriend (26F) loves cooking for me but she doesn't know how


A little bit of backstory: I met my girlfriend at a cooking competition a few years back. She was pretty upset when she didn't win so I offered to take her out to diner and one thing led to another, now we're living together in my apartment.

Now, to say that my girlfriend LOVES cooking for me is the understatement of the week. She will make a whole day out of going out to get ingredients and she even asks me what I want to come home to. She spend her days off cooking; she loves it. Shes always wanted to be a chef but never had the means to go to culinary school. When I get home, there's always a very well-set table with candles and the works with a hot plate of numerous different foods she knows I like. She'll always sit down with me and ask me about my day with the loveliest smile I've ever seen. She doesn't eat much plus she's a fast eater so she always finishes well before I do but she'll stay at the table to talk to me and keep me company. Recently, she read this women's health blog where she read that people waste too much money eating out on a regular basis so now she makes it a point to cook meals for both herself and I much more frequently. She packs a lunch for me to take to work with a little note that always says she loves me, have a nice day, etc.

Now, I don't think I need to express how grateful I am to have such a wonderful girl in my life and I know that what she does for me is out of love and care. I still get butterflies when I think about how her putting in all this effort speaks about how much she loves and appreciates me.  I really do. But theres only one problem: 

The food is terrible

I'm not just talking about tasting a bit off or a little too much salt. I'm talking about borderline inedible. I hate to admit this but I have even gagged sometimes when I eat. It is torture, I do not enjoy eating at all.
I have tried everything I can think of to change her cooking a bit.

I tried cooking for both of us, she got upset because she loves cooking for me and doesn't want me to worry about having to do any work when it comes to food.

I tried cooking WITH her... same story

I took her to a cooking class where we could both learn to cook delicious food. What she made that day in the class tasted delicious! When we got home, she admitted she did not like what she made in class at all and that she would continue to cook in her style.

I have tried to get her to follow recipes, she always ends up putting her own ""spin"" on things and it never tastes good. If I insists she follows it to the letter, she accuses me of not liking her cooking, not appreciating her and it always ends in her crying.

I will admit I am ashamed of this one but I tried to eat out before I got home and blame it on overtime. When I got home, she gave me a huge kiss and told me to let her ""make me happy"" (AKA cook) next time. She even offered to drive over and drop off my food at work.

I tried suggesting that I wanted to show her how much I appreciated her cooking for me by suggesting I cook some dishes she likes for her. Her response was that she enjoys cooking because she does it for me not because she likes food all that much.

She tells me one of the reasons she loves to cook for me is because, I'm the only person who enjoys her food. Nobody else will eat her food. There have been times where I had to eat entires bowls of food over the course of weeks because she made it and it went virtually untouched at a party.

Now there have been a couple of times where she suspected I didn't like what she made. she really took offense to that and cried. Reddit, I don't have the heart to break hers; I don't have the heart to tell her the truth. I just can't bring myself to say it, that smile and twinkle in her eyes just won't let me. What can I do?

TL;DR: MY girlfriend is adores cooking for me a is an absolute darling  about it, but her cooking is terrible."
"Update: My(24F) parents(late 60s f+m) reacted extremely unhappy when I told them I was getting married. I can't get over how hurt I feel.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zerfg/my24f_parentslate_60s_fm_reacted_extremely/


Well, my parents got over how unhappy they were. My dad has since shut his mouth when it comes to the wedding. Now my mom is trying to 100% control everything.

She wants to invite 100+ people and have it at her venue. My Fiance and I found a lovely venue that can seat up to 100 people but we want at most 70 which we tried compromising on as well as the venue had a minimum so we were willing to go higher to meet it for this venue.


She completely lost her mind at this. She wants it at the country club of which my grandfather was a member of my Uncles are members and my cousins are members. She refuses to hear otherwise. HEr definition of compromise is that we are wanting to have it on a Monday because it falls on a certain date aka my Fiances grandparents and parents were members, a small way to honour his late mother who he was extremely close to.

So that is what she believed SHE compromised on. So she literally wants to set up EVERYTHING else. 

I'm done. And I told her so. I was so upset that she couldn't even try to not make it about herself I went No Contact with her. I told her we will pay her back for the dress. It's beautiful btw.

Jokes on her though, We will have a wonderful ceremony with my fiances entire family and she will not be there. She will have nothing to do with my wedding and it will be wonderful. My brother is extremely angry with me as he is her GoldenChild and now is basically her flying monkey as well. My dad hasn't said a word to me but he never really talks to me anyway.

TLDR: Mom got over her anger and tried to control absolutely everything about the wedding. Got angry went No contact with her and she is no longer invited. Will have my wedding with just my fiances family and be very happy. They are lovely people.

"My [34M] family are furious with me because I recused myself from interviewing my own cousin [28F] on a job application.


The firm that I work for is hiring for a position which my cousin applied to. It was my responsibility to interview and pick someone for the position however due to this conflict of interest I asked a coworker to take over reviewing my cousin's application. This is what the guidelines say we must do if we know an applicant at a personal level. You write a reference and pass it onto someone else.

My cousin came in for the interview and didn't get the job. According to my colleague, she didn't do well at the interview. It's normal and it happens to everyone.

Suddenly now I'm getting calls and emails from my parents, uncle and aunt about betraying my family and not helping my cousin in her career and this is going to be the end of the world for her (seriously?) and how she is depressed and it's all my fault.

I'm shocked and don't know what to say, and how to convince them that I did what I must have done in this situation as there wasn't anything I could do. Can you help me figure out how I should talk to them?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Cousin applied for a job where I work. I passed her on to a coworker to interview her and she didn't get the job. Entire family are furious with me.  "
"My [26F] parents send my ex-boyfriend good morning messages...2 years after we broke up. I’m increasingly uncomfortable with their relationship and unsure how to handle it anymore.


I [26F] broke up with my ex-boyfriend [28M]  (of 6 years)  2 years ago after a very long, ugly, years-in-the-making decline of the relationship. I’ve had no contact with him since 2016. 


Very shortly before we ended things, he got very close to my parents [63F and 58M]. In fact, when we ended it for the very last time, he went to my house when I was at school and told them the most skewed, self-victimizing version of the breakup. 


Due in part to what he said, my parents (mainly my mom) asked me to drop out of school to “work on being a better person” because they thought that law school made me into the kind of person who could hurt him. 


Very shortly after, I moved into my own place. There were a lot of reasons for the move out, but a major part of the decision was that I felt they prioritized my ex boyfriend over me based on how it appeared they’d rather have him and I together than have me in professional school. It was honestly one of the worst periods of my life. There was 5 months in between where I had no contact with my parents. 


But I did end up patching things up with them. It was hard work. We talked about a lot of uncomfortable things, and found that there are some things that we’ll never agree on (namely my romantic relationships and the level of control/involvement they get in them). But overall, we forged a loving, kinda-functional relationship. We’ve had good communication, support, all that for over a year now. 


I knew my parents still had contact with my ex. I knew he got their Christmas card and they sent him happy birthday emails. I told them it bothered me, and that I wished they wouldn’t, but I also said that they’re adults and I can’t control who they associate with. I figured if I wasn’t giving them control of who I dated, I couldn’t ask for control of who they were friends with. 


This weekend, I spent some time at home. My mom (of course) brought up my ex, and how nice and funny he is and how we should start talking again. She then started talking about how he responds the funniest things to my dad’s “good morning” messages. 



I think I should explain something about my dad’s good morning messages. When he wakes up, he sends out these really horrible puns. (“Why doesn’t the robot-beach have lifeguards? The waves aren’t big enough to be dangerous...they’re microwaves.”) I love my dad’s good morning messages. I send him back even worse puns. It’s great. There’s something so pure about waking up to terrible puns your dad sent at 5am. I adore those messages. 



I thought my dad was sending them to me and my siblings. I had no idea he was sending them to my ex. When I inquired further, my mom admitted that she texts to him almost daily too. 


It hurts. I keep telling myself that it’s their prerogative to text who they want but it bothers me. Every message I get now, I feel like it’s a reminder that he’s oh so important to my parents because he gets the same morning love as me—like somehow I don’t feel the same about my “good morning” messages because he gets them too. Its like I’ve had something that made me feel special taken from me. 


And some  days I feel like their relationship with my ex is really, really unhealthy. The daily reminder has taken something that I could ignore (the disagreement we have over how much control over my love life they get)and made it something that bothers me every single day. 


What should I do? I see it kinda 3 ways: 


I’ve told my parents their contact with him hurts me. I’m pretty sure it’s not normal. I don’t think I can stop them, but I can’t avoid the fact that their relationship bothers me. 


A friend suggested I contact my ex and ask him to stop talking to them, but I feel like that opens up the line of communication between him and I, which is something I’ve fought very hard to close. 


And...I know I could grow up and get over it. Maybe I’m making something out of nothing and I need to grow up. Maybe it’s normal for parents to have this level of contact with their kid’s exes, and I need to get over it. 


TL;DR - I found out my parents have daily contact with my ex. It’s weird, I hate it, but I’m not sure if I should just shut up and deal with it.  


Thanks for reading this, and thanks in advance for your advice : ) "
"Boyfriend [31M] cancelled plans, I [33F] plan to go without him anyway. He's now upset.


We've been dating for 8 months, and the honeymoon period seems to be coming to an end.  There's an annual event in the city that we had made plans to go.  It's free, so neither of us are out financially on tickets, reservations, etc.  I mentioned that I was interested in going last week.  He was reluctant about it so I told him that if he didn't want to, then we didn't have to.  He brought it up on Saturday and said we should go so we made a plan to do so.  Today, he texts me and says he's not feeling it and doesn't want to go anymore.  I replied back saying ""No worries.  I know it's not your thing. \[kissy face emoji\]""  Then followed up with ""I'll check to see if my friends have plans to go and join them.""  He calls me  and in the ensuing conversation, tells me he's upset that I'm still going to go, and that he was hoping to spend the evening with me like we had planned.  I told him the plan was the event, and I'm not upset that he's backing out, but the change of plans means that we can change who we're spending time with tonight too.  It flares up from there with him saying that I don't want to see him and that I obviously don't care about him.  I ask if he is feeling sick or unwell, and wants me to bring soup or something, and he says no.  He just doesn't want to be in a crowd which makes him nervous.  I say okay, I had my heart set on going to the event, so whether I go with him, go with my friends, or go alone, I'm going.  We end the conversation.  15 minutes later, he texts me and says he'll go with me.  In the meantime, I had already reached out to my friends and a few of them said I could join them.  So I text him back and let him know that my friends wants us to join them and he gets grumpy again.  His reply ""Fine.  I guess we'll do what you want.  Again.""  It pissed me off and I haven't replied yet.  I don't want him to force himself to come for me.  I want to see him because I miss him.  I don't want him to be moody around my friends.  I also don't want to have an ongoing fight about this next time I see him if I tell him not to come.  Disinvite him or not?

TLDR: Boyfriend mad that I still plan on going to an event even though he tried to back out earlier.  Now he wants to come and is probably going to be moody about it around my friends.  Do I still go with him?"
"UPDATE:My (35f) bf (34) called one of his friends his ""life partner"". He apologised, but I still feel upset by this.


Hello Reddit,

I thought I'd update you on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8z48gg/my_35f_bf_34_called_one_of_his_friends_his_life/).

The comments suggested that we have a talk regarding - if he is calling his ex his life partner- where does it put me? Also am I his life partner? Some said I was overreacting, some was said that the real issue was that I felt inadequate and that it was not clear whether he saw me as his life partner. It turns out that my reaction was really just a reaction to the fact that we did not progress in our relationship enough to feel like we were partners.

Some other incompatibilities transpired in this - he was more into the idea of being in a relationship, but in practice has little room/ need for partnership, most of other things he is used to doing on his own, which I found hurtful. He said that is a bit solipsistic as a result. For example when we met, we usually just hung out, having drinks or going to music events. We didn't do much more. He once rejected my suggestion of going for a walk as if he doesn't like it - and then later, we ended up having a long country side walk.

I asked why he never suggest going for walks with me- and he said that this is something he thinks of as a solitary activity. Which is fine, but once it moves to all areas of life, it  just leaves us with nothing but the idea of a relationship to bind us together, we are not actual partners in anything. In recent times I would basically have the feeling of being alone, rather than with somebody, most of the time we went to music events.  He would dance alone, stand alone, and only once in a while engage with me in some way. I am perfectly happy to do my own thing- but I still want to have a feeling that we are part of the same ""team"" that arrived somewhere together, even if we end up drifting to separate parts of the venue. We would have this togetherness sometimes, but at others he was completely withdrawn, and prickly when I tried to engage. The patchiness of our connection  eventually made me withdraw, and stop trying, because I found it hurtful, and confusing- because we still had amazing sex and were at times close as normal.

On the last time we went out together, I was happy to see him and greeted him with a hug and kisses and he was kind of withdrawn. I figured he was hungry/not feeling well, so we got him some food and then went to the gig. During it he was just standing there - I could have been next to a completely random person. Eventually he  ""arrived"" - he smiled at me and engaged, and tried to hug me and started being nice.  But by the time nearly 4 hours from our meeting have passed and I did not want to engage with him, because I was by then upset by his prior non- engagement. I get that he might have been feeling unwell- but if he did so, he could have communicated it somehow &amp; or not come out at all and stayed in bed.

I basically never felt like being part of a team together with him- especially in relation to his friends- and he admitted that in the first months he thought of me as a stranger, hence prioritised his friends.

Which again, was hurtful, because in that time \*he\* wanted the relationship to make us safe to be able to be vulnerable with each other. Now it transpired that despite us making ourselves vulnerable and being close at the time,  being in a committed relationship, he did not think of me as ""one of his own people"", which frankly, was insulting to the level of vulnerability I brought into this, and to the role of partner I gave him from the moment we were in a relationship.

We had a talk where he admitted that he possibly liked the idea of a relationship more, and that he might not be ready to have a partner as such. I suggested we take a couple of week break, to give us a bit of a rest and see how we feel afterwards.

I missed him &amp; wanted to stay with him- however into the middle of the second week, he broke up with me, citing that his feelings did not develop as he hoped them too, that he will probably stop dating all together, the he cannot give me what I need, that it will probably be as ""good as it gets"", that he spend to much time alone and is basically used to just thinking of himself as alone.  He also admitted that maybe he is still waiting for a ""ray of light"" to come from the sky  - to fall in to perfect love with someone.

I feel like our relationship didn't develop, because the friendship aspect did not develop. He always did prioritise his friends (many of whom are exes), and hence I felt really inadequate, because of course I could not compete with a friendship that was 12 years long!

As a side note- I do believe him when he says that this is as good as it gets for him - he compartmentalised his friendships and relationships to the extreme, not only with me- but with everyone. Most of his friends and partners did not meet each other- I was included in quite a lot of things, compared to others. For example he celebrated one of his past birthdays with  university friend, the ""life partner"" close friend ( ex from the OP)  &amp; her fiancee. He did not invite his then girlfriend.  I think this was one of the things, I judged him the most for - to exclude his girlfriend from his main birthday celebrations is just weird. And I kind of started to identify with her after a while, I was upset for her sake.

Now he \*wants to be friends with me\*. I kind of feel that this is really ironic-our relationship failed because he was more committed to his friends, and did not see me as ""one of his own"" - and now he wants the commitment and intimacy of friendship with me? I feel like he wants an endless supply of free cake, when he already refused to buy it, and said that he does't like it.

Life goes on, I guess. I am upset, because I really tried to make this work, and he pushed us initially into the idea of a relationship- but somehow got stubborn about actually sticking to his solitary ways.  I am also upset because I really did like him &amp; I miss him.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* bf broke up with me because he was not able to be my partner"
"My [22F] boyfriend's [26 M] constant eating is leaving me broke.


I'm a bit grumpy right now and I need a place to rant.

I have always had an open fridge policy with my boyfriend. I'm a feeder and I love to cook for people. My boyfriend works long hard days, and eats most of his meals at my apartment. He sometimes does my grocery shopping for me, or just slips me some money for all the food he eats (probably $60-$80), but it isn't enough any more. I'm broke right now, and I'm hungry, and he's going to get off work in an hour and if he starts complaining that theres nothing to eat or that he's hungry, I might snap.

My boyfriend eats three times as much as I do easily. I cannot keep a loaf of bread in my house. It's like he sniffs it out and the entire loaf is gone within minutes. Cheese and juice are the same. I make enough pasta to feed a family and he can finish everything and then be back in the kitchen making popcorn an hour later. I've done three grocery trips since Wednesday, fruit, pasta, yogurt, juice, 5 loaves of bread, salami, cheese, honey, olives. I spent probably $130 on food and its all gone.

My boyfriend is in great shape, and I'd never want to shame anyone for eating when they're hungry, because I've been there before and it doesn't feel good. But *come on*. I'm close to tears right now because I don't know what I'm going to eat for dinner and I certainly don't have enough to feed him. I want to just tell him he can't come over so that I don't have to deal with this stress.

I know that something has to change with the way that we handle food in the relationship. I don't want to have to ask him to be more considerate of how much he's eating. I'd feel stingy asking him to pitch in more money for food. We're not roommates, he's my boyfriend and I'm happy to feed him. How do you handle grocery shopping with a SO when you don't even live together? What is fair here?

TL;DR: My boyfriend eats three times as much as I do in my house. He does my grocery shopping for me sometimes, and also gives me some money every month to help cover the cost of everything he eats. I'm hungry and I'm angry because he's eaten everything in my home. "
"Update: Me [26F] just found out that my estranged father has died. Do I contact siblings that don't know I exist or leave it be?


Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sklx1/me_26f_just_found_out_that_my_estranged_father/

TL;DR: dad abandoned me as a child, had another two daughters after me that don't know I exist and today I found out he's died. Do I send commiserations or leave it be?

Okay so on to the update. So as I mentioned in the previous post, I had a liver transplant and one of the side effects of that is that I'm a heightened risk of developing cancer and it's kind of stewed with me for a few weeks because I knew my dad died of cancer but I wanted and needed to know specifics. I tried finding out without contacting any of the family but every point turned up empty. I decided that I needed to contact someone in the family and I sent a message through facebook to my dad's ex-wife and the mother of my eldest sister, I explained that I was sorry for her loss and that she could ignore this message but I'd really like to know what happened to my dad and if she could provide me with the details of his death.

Right, well, remember how I said that my sisters didn't know about me? I was so wrong, my eldest sister Lucy (22F) has known about me the entire time, she has photos of me from when we met at her birthday party, she had been begging our dad and grandmother for information about me and my address but had been rebuffed all the time because they didn't want my youngest sister Amy (15-16f) to find out, so Lucy had to keep me secret her entire life. Lucy's mum passed my details on to her and we've been talking the past few days and it's been amazing. We're so alike despite not growing up together and she's smart and funny and I'm so happy. I'm nervous about Amy finding out, whilst Lucy was well aware our dad wasn't perfect, Amy is still thinks the world of him and I will ruin that image of him in her head. And because of him forcing Lucy to keep me a secret, Lucy and Amy really aren't close because how guilty Lucy feels.

Of course, I'm still angry, I'm in therapy and there's so much talk about with my therapist, I think finding out he put Lucy through so much too makes it even worse, we both have so many questions that we just can't answer and it's heartbreaking but we're working towards a relationship and I'm so happy. I'm mad that because he felt he needed to keep me secret (why? It seems no one knows) has ruined the relationship between all three of his daughters, it makes no sense to me. All the adults know about me?? It's just bizarre. 

I just wanted you guys to know because you were super supportive and helpful in my initial post! And I guess there'll be another one when/if Amy finds out I exist. Thank you so much

TL;DR I contacted dad's ex-wife, reconnected with my younger sister who knew I existed all along and had been forced to keep me a secret and we're not working towards a relationship. Youngest sister still doesn't know I exist."
"I (30f) have pneumonia and my fiance (28m) is refusing to help.


We've been together for four years. 

I'd like to start off by saying that this is embarrassing. It's embarrassing that I can't feed myself. The most I can do is stumble to the bathroom. I feel so useless. My kids are helping me with bare necessities, like water or crackers. But that's about as much as they can do, as they're little. 

Yesterday I had to pick up my kids, drive to the doctor, and pick up my prescriptions. By the time I got back I was shaking and almost didn't make it up the stairs. I had asked my fiance to at least pick up my kids. He responded ""I'm not picking up your fucking kids!""

I asked him to pick me something up from the store again, and I was met with the same response.

Maybe I'm being emotional. I don't know. I've never been this sick in my life. It's actually quite terrifying not being able to breathe. I just wish he would be a little more understanding, instead he just sighs, scoffs, and cusses at me. And on top of everything, I'm getting kind of scared that I'm going to waste away into nothing because I don't have the energy to get out of bed for more than a minute.

TLDR - Fiance is refusing to help me with even basic care when I'm sick with pneumonia. I don't know what to do. Or even if I have a right to be upset. "
"I (26/F) found out I was married to a con man (30M), who takes advantage of and destroys women's lives. Should I warn his new girlfriend (24F), for whom he left me?


My story is long, so I apologize in advance.

In 2014, when I had just gotten out of a horribly abusive relationship, I met who I thought was my soulmate. Let's call him Bernard. 

Bernard was a true gentleman: good-looking, extremely charming and polite. He had a gift with words, and could maky anyone he met almost instantly trust him. He fell in love with me nearly at first sight, and it wasn't long before he started showering me with affection. I didn't know the term ""love-bombing"" then, but I sure do now. After we met, he took me on 10 increasingly romantic dates, one for each day. At the 10th date, accompanied by a very luxurious set-up, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I gladly accepted. I had never felt so in love. I had never felt so lucky. I could finally comprehend that those romantic-comedy tropes of rose-tinted glasses, butterflies in your stomach and all that jazz.

Bernard wasn't only a true romantic, he was also successful. At 26, he had his own thriving business, and wasn't shy about letting me know how much he was making. He readily insisted on paying for all our dates, taking me shopping, you name it. He simply wouldn't take no for an answer. I was making decent money myself at the time, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't appreciate being spoiled. He made me feel like a princess. Three weeks later, we were living together.

There was trouble in paradise pretty quickly, however. As soon as Bernard and I went public, some people approached me cautiously to tell me that he was engaged with a girl that I'll call Ellie. I didn't believe them, of course, and instead took to him to explain the ordeal. He opened up about his crazy ex, a girl who what nearly bullied him into buying her a ring and then had spread the rumor that he had proposed. It had, of course, been a deliberate lie on her part. He had broken up with her soon after, and she had even threatened to kill herself! Eventually, she accepted to leave him alone, but only after he had paid her a hefty sum of money! This had all happened nearly a year before, and he was upset that people still brought it up.

Completely convinced that he was speaking the truth, I never mentioned the issue again. Several more people came to tell me that he was or at least had been engaged, but I briefly corrected them and refused to partake in any more conversation. Eventually, the issue died down.

Bernard was a great partner for the most part. He was incredibly romantic and incredibly committed. After only 1.5 months of dating, life forced us into a long distance relationship. He never even thought of breaking up. We video-chatted daily and sent care packages often. For nearly three months, he wrote me a letter every single day. At the 6 month mark, he paid for my flights to go see him, and took the opportunity to introduce me to his family. Then, he came to visit me in my country, and met my family as well. 

This long distance relationship should have lasted 2 years, and then I'd move back to his country to be with him. This was our plan. However, when the first year was up, he told me he could no longer bear with the distance. He wanted to move so that he could be with me. His once thriving business was now nearly bankrupt, so he had very little to leave behind. The timing was perfect. 

This is how Bernard left China to come to Europe. 

As soon as he got to Europe, we filled a request to get married. This was the only way for us to stay together, and we both knew it.  While we waited for the embassies to clear things up, my family and I tried to get Bernard a jump-start in his new life. He had come with next nothing, he had barely any clothes. My family and I paid for everything, namely our rent and an education. After all, how was he supposed to make it here without speaking the local language? 

It didn't take long for Bernard to get back on his feet. He started networking with other Chinese people, and tirelessly working 2 jobs. He wasn't making much, but he was building a reputation. Eventually, he learned how he could earn big bucks: through the Golden Visa market. He became a realtor, and sold properties to wealthy Chinese families who longed to move to Europe. All these people had to do was invest 500 000 euros, and they'd be set. 

Bernard did well on his job for the next 2 years. By then, we had gotten married. He was barely ever home. He worked ridiculous shifts, sometimes up to 80 hours a week. When he got home, he was always too tired to pay me any mind. His romantic side was long gone, and I struggled to even maintain a conversation with him. 

Eventually, the Golden Visa market for my country dried up. The hot new location was somewhere else in Europe. Bernard said he'd be making frequent business trips to his other country, and I supported him as usual. The thing is, he never really came back. He paid for me to go visit him once, after having been gone for 1.5 months. My visit coincided with my birthday, as well as valentines day. Bernard didn't spend any amount of time with me in either of those dates, nor did he bother to buy me a present. We argued. I cried. He got frustrated and aggressive. By then, this had sadly become the norm.

It wasn't two months later than Bernard called me, and told me he was seeing someone new in this new country. Let's call her Eliza. She was 24, and they had met through work. He described her as pure and innocent. Still in love with this man, I urged him to come home so that we could try and save our marriage. He made the trip, made love to me, told me he loved me and that we were going to figure things out... and by the end of the week confessed he had been lying the entire time. He didn't love me. He didn't want me. He wanted a divorce.

Bernard didn't stop there, however. He made sure that I would lose my job as well. For, you see, I worked in his same company. He also took our pet kitten. I was left alone, in an expensive apartment, with nothing to hold on to except for a few thousand euros he left me so that I could ""start my new life"". I was lost, devastated, and had lost all my self-worth. 

Then I remembered the weird start of our relationship and decided to do some digging. I found Ellie, his ""psycho"" ex, and she told me her story, which was surprisingly like me. Ellie and Bernard had dated for nearly 3 years. He had pursued her just as intensely as he had pursued me, and she had fell for him just as hard as I had. After a few months, he had told her he wanted to move to another city, in order to get a better paying job. He told her how he wanted to start his own business, and how he needed to save so that he could afford such an investment. Ellie offered to lend him the necessary money for him to get his business off the ground, and he took it. Eventually, he asked Ellie to quit her job as a senior manager to join him in his business venture. It was a risky move, especially since Ellie was a high school dropout... But she took a leap of faith. The business took off, and she started dropping hints that she wanted to get married. At the time, she was already 28, which is a bit late by Chinese standards. Bernard bought her a ring and proposed in November 2013. Then, he broke up with her during a business trip, through text message, only 3 months later. When he came back, he told her to pack up her things and leave their apartment. Ellie left with nothing: she was heartbroken, homeless, and unemployed. Bernard gave her a few thousands RMB for her to ""start her new life"" as well.

Now for the shocking part: Bernard ruined Ellie in April 2014. We started officially dating only three months after that. 

There is no doubt in my mind that Eliza is his next prey. She is young, probably very immature, and completely unaware that he has all the characteristics of a sociopath, or at least a narcissist. I still have contacts in the company that fired me when Bernard left me, and I know for a fact that he managed to get Eliza to replace me. He is currently her manager.

I don't know if I should try to approach this girl and warn her of what's to come. She knew he was still married to me when they started their affair, but for all I know he probably told her some story of how I was a ""crazy psycho"" too. I'd be lying if I said I don't hold a certain grudge against her since, even after everything that he did to me, I did love my husband... So part of me wants karma to catch up with her. But, more importantly, I fear that she will not believe me. After all, I am the jaded ex wife who would say anything to try and break her and her new boo apart.

What should I do, Reddit?

**TLDR:** My ex husband is a con-man, who uses women for his own personal gain and drops them when he no longer needs them. Should I warn his new girlfriend?"
"How do I [F 23] face my creepy coworker [M 30] in court?


A while ago, my co-worker got a promotion, got drunk at his celebration and engaged in some very bad behavior. Unfortunately, I was there when he was doing these things (and tried really hard to stop him from doing what he was doing). Afterwards I was scared of what I saw and I told some of other co-workers I trusted about what happened. These coworkers were horrified about what happened. They told HR and he was fired immediately. Now there is a company wide investigation into \[M 30\] and he has been criminally charged for the event I witnessed.

A few weeks ago, I had to testify to what I saw and as his lawyer was tearing into me,  \[M 30\] was smiling creepily at me the whole time. That smile literally haunts me in my dreams. Worst of all, I still have to finish testifying in about three months.

How do I face this man in court knowing full well he did exactly what he did and face that frankly predatory look of his? I'm afraid he's going to come after me if he's not found guilty.

TL;DR I have to face my former coworker in court and his creepy smile terrifies me. How do I face him?"
"Update: Me [28/F] with my lawyer [38/m]. Did he ask me out? If he did, is that unethical of him? I'm curious but would it be a bad idea?


Original tl;dr"" Me [28/F] with my lawyer [38/m]. Did he ask me out? If he did, is that unethical of him? I'm curious but would it be a bad idea?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/935ylb/me_28f_with_my_lawyer_38m_did_he_ask_me_out_if_he/

Well, Mark actually called me the next morning after my post, and I missed his call. Then I called him back but he wasn't in. I was a little anxious in case it had to do with my case, something had gone wrong or I owed him money. But I didn't think it was actually any of those, and I was also curious to see what he would say.

I missed a second call from him and called him back in the evening and he was there.

He started out by saying, ""So, everything in your case went really well!""

I said, ""Yes it did, thank you so much!""

He said, ""No problem. Actually I was wondering... would you leave me a review online? Like on Google? It would really help my business.""

I said, ""Sure, no problem.""

He said, ""Great! If you could leave it on Website1 or Website2 that would be perfect.""

I said ""Okay I will.""

He said, ""Great!"" and then he repeated the line he had said to me in the court. Pretty much the same but this time he said it faster as if it was a script: ""It was great to meet you, I meet nice people in the strangest of places, feel free to call me, if you have any questions, or just want to talk.""

I said okay, thank you and take care. It seemed like he was just trying to build rapport with me for future business and recommendations. And possibly he thinks I might need legal help in the future haha.

Edit: apparently my post got locked but you can PM me if you have any response.

tl;dr: I think he was just networking for business"
"I (22M) justed moved in with my friend (26M) and he's making me feel uncomfortable


I met this guy back in march and we got along really well and we started hanging out quite a bit. We have similar interests and for the most part take the same classes in university. One thing led to another and we decided to move in together as roommates in an apartment, since it's cheaper to live when two people split the rent, and none of us thought there would be any problems living together as we got along really well. We planned the move really well, we set up rules for eachother, such as alternating every other week between him and I cleaning, and more things like that. I was confident I'd be able to live with him since he's lived on his own for at least four years, so he'd be able to do tasks and chores well, or so I thought. 

We moved in the new apartment back in July. It was a nightmare moving everything as we can't afford a moving company, so it took a lot of energy to complete the move. For its cost, the apartment is really nice and I love everything about it. It is spacious, modern, and the location is fantastic. But things started going downhill after we moved in. He started becoming more affectionate than before. Calling me baby, constantly hugging me and kissing me, etc. He follows me around constantly. I sit infront of my computer a lot, either to work on projects (we're both game devs working on the same project), or to play video games. I kid you not, he will sit next to me while I play video games for at least 5 hours straight just watching while I play video games, or when I browse the internet, or when I watch youtube videos (he will watch the youtube video even though he doesn't hear the sound since I'm the ones with the headphones, which completely eliminates the point of watching the video in the first place since he can't hear what anyone says). It's like he doesn't have anything better to do with his time. When I go to the bathroom he sometimes just waits outside. When I go to the kitchen for a glass of water he follows me there. He also wants us to do EVERYTHING mutually.

*((side-note, example of him wanting to do everything I do:) I proposed that we buy our own food instead of buying it mutually, since we then have the freedom of eating our own separate food how much we want. But he wants us to buy food mutually, as in, we buy for example a big pack of hot dogs and cut the price in half. Since none of us are very rich, this forces each of us to eat 50% of the hot dogs or one is getting more worth out of the money they spend, and we also have to be craving the same food. My proposition gives each of us responsibility over our own food so we can eat different things, and gives us 100% worth out of what we buy. Another example would be that he wants to buy one big pack of orange juice and split the cost between us 50%. But what if he enjoys it way more than I do, and drinks more of it?  Economically, it becomes overly complicated for no reason instead of him buying the orange juice for himself, and if I get a craving for it, I go buy my own orange juice.)*

He complains that I don't let him shower when I'm showering or using the bathroom, etc. I'm not comfortable being completely naked around other guys but he doesn't get it, and takes it personally. He wants us to share the same laundry basket (when we already have our own baskets), even though it just complicates things later when we just have to sort our clothes back and forth to see who's clothes are who's clothes. Sometimes in the morning, when he thinks I'm not awake, he opens the door to my room, and then when I catch him in the act, he says he just wanted to ""tease me"", even though I've said that he's not allowed in my room. He doesn't allow girls to sleep over in my room either, since he gets ""jealous"" of them (his words). 

*(another side-note: i had to fix all the paperwork, and talk to the landlord about stuff that only affects him, because he's either too lazy or anxious to talk to people, so I have to do a bunch of extra chores as well)*

It was all tolerable, and he seemed to listen to my pleads of ""please stop touching me"" as it was getting better, until I heard him tell me that he wanted to go on a DATE with me. And he also said that he's never slept with a guy before and wanted to try it out with ME....?!? He told me prior to moving in that he was 100% heterosexual. Now he says he's doubting it and wants to experiment. I've said no, I'm not interested. He says he's OK with that but he still calls me baby, does all the affectionate things that I've told him a billion times not to do. I'm tired of it, annoyed, frustrated, and uncomfortable. It's a shame because we were such good friends, and it feels like I'm ruining not only the friendship, but also the game dev project we're working on together with 8 other people, as if I stop being friends with him I'm pretty sure he's going to leave the project, and that's not good because he's pretty vital and there's a lot of money involved. The sad thing is also that, despite all of this, he's generally a very nice guy and if he wasn't so god damn affectionate I'd still hang out with him. He just never listens to the fact that he makes me uncomfortable by doing the things that he does. 

**TLDR: My good friend started getting feelings for me after we moved in, and he's really hard to live with, but I'd hate to break the friendship as we both got along really well (and still do, apart from the fact that he's been annoyingly affectionate a lot of the time recently), and the fact that we're both part of the same game dev project.**

I don't really know what to do. Do I kick him out of the apartment? Do I suck it in and hope that it gets better? I'd really hate to move out since it was a nightmare to move in and I really like the flat. I've never been in this situation before and I'm just really confused. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks for reading!"
"My mom [54F] won’t let my brother [14M] grow up and I’m worried he’s gonna lack basic skills


I am the oldest of two kids. I am a 20 year old female and my brother is 14. I grew up babysitting him a lot due to the 7 year age gap. A lot of the times this would annoy me during my teen years during summer when I wanted to hang with friends but was stuck watching my brother because my parents were working. But still, my brother was pretty young so even I was kind of nervous to leave him on his own.

However, my brother is 14 now, a reasonable age to be taking care of himself, but my mother refuses to teach him how, I’m guessing because he’s the youngest and still her baby, but I’m afraid it will affect him later. 

&gt; My brother barely knows how to feed himself. He can really only microwave because my mom is afraid to let him use the stove. But he has taken cooking classes at school before so he knows what he’s doing. I’m not expecting him to be a master chef, but there are meals like mac and cheese and ramen that he enjoys but cannot cook for himself. To this day my mom still asks me to stay home to cook these things for him.

&gt; He doesn’t know how to wash dishes and do other things with his hands (ha ha not that). My mom doesn’t let my brother do dishes, pick up pots (another reason he can’t use the stove), and other things because my mom is afraid he is too weak and will drop things. She says he has bad motor skills, which he does a bit, but he can definitely develop them (he’s great at video games), but he’s just not being taught. Today I literally had to teach him how to tie a rubber band around a chip bag and he was really struggling.

&gt; He doesn’t know how to protect himself in the house. A bit ago I asked him if he knew our address and what to do in case of emergencies and he said no. I understand with technology these days, he might not need to know our address, but as a kid I had safety procedures drilled into my head. I think my mom is relying on me to protect him which is why I still have o babysit him.

&gt; Shaving...now this one I don’t know if it’s really an issue. But my brother has been rocking that gross teen stache for a while now. He told me he wanted to shave it because it made him feel ugly. There were a lot of things regarding puberty that I wasn’t taught that made me feel awkward so I didn’t want my brother to feel the same. But whenever I bring up shaving to my mom she gets very angry and says he’s not ready or she’ll teach him eventually. The conversation is short and abrupt.

Those are just a few things. There are other things he learned very late as a result of my overprotective mom. I’ve been trying to teach him these things myself, but he only does them when I tell him. If I bring it up to my mom, she gets angry, but it would be nice if she encouraged him to grow up a bit too so he could make these things a habit.

Yes, some of it is still me wishing I didn’t have to babysit him. But at this age, I knew how to take after myself if left alone. I have friends with siblings his age or younger who also know. However, I know it’s not my place to tell my mom how to parent.  

Is this really a problem or is he at an okay pace for his age? Should I stop worrying? 

*TL;DR*: My mom won’t teach my brother how to take care of himself (cook, chores, shave) and I’m afraid he’s gonna be a giant man-child when he grows up."
"My (29f) friend (33f) is always late. I’m at a restaurant and it’s been almost an hour since I’ve gotten here. Should I just leave?


So while I sit here in embarrassment as the server continually asks me if I want a refill I thought I’d make a post. 

I’ve known my “friend” since birth, she’s actually my cousin. Being late isn’t a new thing, it’s habitual and I always make sure to confirm the times with her and let her choose times to meet up. 

Last time we met, we were taking our kids to the park. She was over an hour late. She texted me about ten minutes after she was supposed to be there, saying she would be a little bit late but was on her way. I was already there with my son waiting. 
Then she texted me almost half an hour later saying she went home because she forgot her phone? But she texted me saying she was on her way. 
In any case, she was an hour and ten minutes late that day but our kids eventually got to play together. 

The time before that we invited her over for dinner. I told her we would eat at 5:30 and to try and be there by 5. She arrived with her kids at almost 7pm. My kid goes to bed at 8pm and the food was all cold by the time she got there. It was already in the oven so I didn’t want to overcook it. 

The time before that she was about half an hour late, didn’t have the kids with her. Didn’t have an excuse. 

I scheduled a time to meet her for lunch with our grandmother, I was in between appointments and we agreed to meet at a restaurant at 12 noon. She arrived with my grandmother at 12:30 and I had to rush my meal and take it to go. 
I asked why they were late to my grandmother and she just said my cousin was taking her sweet time getting ready, and picked my grandmother up late. 

It’s now been 55 minutes since we were supposed to meet and she texted me saying “5 mins away” fifteen minutes ago. 
Should I just ask for the bill and leave? I’m kind of sick of it. 

TLDR: friend always late. Lies about when she will arrive or how long she will be. I am always on time or five minutes early for everything and I’m getting really sick of waiting. "
"I can feel my love and respect for my parents slipping away due to my mother being the victim of multiple scams and my father’s passivity. I feel guilty and angry - AT THEM. How to move forward?


God, the title makes me sound so mean. Maybe I AM mean, and just don't know it yet...


A couple of years ago, my (40s) mother (60s) started really getting heavily into Facebook.  She’s never been a really extroverted person to begin with and only has a couple of semi-close friends because she’s judgmental and feels superior to just about everyone she meets.  And she and my dad live like roommates in their home, spending hours apart in their own worlds.

 

Facebook slowly filled in these gaps.  She began accepting friend requests from pretty much anyone who sent her one until she had 823 “friends”.  Strange for someone who disdains real, live people, but all that her FB “friends” ever showed her were their best sides, of course.

 

Then, about a year ago, escalation: she started having emotional affairs with several random men that she had friended.  She started texting them from her cellphone with her real number, giving out her work email, etc.  These misadventures were only discovered once she started borrowing money heavily from her family and friends – and from me.

 

At first, I thought it was a gambling addiction; I had no idea she had gotten so sucked into FB.  But when she contacted me again to borrow another large amount of money urgently, it tipped me off that some fucking shenanigans were going down. 

 

I started asking the hard questions and the story came out: she had been siphoning money via wire transfers to some internet asshole who had been feeding her flattery and romance for months.  He convinced her that he was a millionaire living on a yacht in international waters, and that he was sending her over a “security box” via a “diplomat” that was full of over $1M in cash, stocks, and bonds, but that he needed her to continue send money to various accounts for VAT fees, customs, applications, etc.  Of course, every time she sent him money, he gave her another excuse as to why the “box” wasn’t in her hands yet, and why he needed more money to get past the latest roadblock.  Hallmarks of classic scamming. 

 

My sister and I finally convinced her that it was all bullshit, and to stop wiring him money and block him immediately…but not before she had already wired him over $60K that she had borrowed from others.  There was no way to stop the wire transfers, and no way to recoup the funds she had wired to places like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria (go figure).

 

My dad sat by during this discovery and although he claimed to be upset, seemed pretty blase about it, considering they had just lost the equivalent of over a year’s average salary.

 

My mother seemed to eventually understand – after many tears, much cajoling, and a visit from the police to take an official report – that she had been gullible in her need for attention and her greed in getting a huge ROI.  In the end, she had to take out $$$$ from her retirement account in order to pay everyone back.  I thought the hard and expensive lesson she had learned would at least cultivate in her a little healthy skepticism.

 

Wrong. I just found out this past week that SHE HAS FALLEN FOR ANOTHER SCAM.  Not only has she lost another $7000 before I was able to find out and intervene, but she was also being blackmailed by a different “friend” that he would release all of their romantic texts on FB if she didn’t pay him $2000.

 

When I asked her how she could have gotten into this same situation again, she protested that these were “different guys” and the situations were “not at all the same”.  


My father again seemed only slightly disgruntled, even though they are now perched precariously on the rugged cliffs of bankruptcy.  I don’t know if that’s because he is not aware that the background behind her falling for this latest scam is my mother’s flirting and romancing with some random men on the internet (I have seen texts pop up on her phone, so I know it’s not just innocent friendships). Maybe he thinks she was being compassionate and noble in helping a “friend”. Maybe he's just resigned.  Maybe he knows about her affairs and just doesn't care.

 

The first time it happened, I did feel sorry for her.  I understood she might have been lonely and not super savvy regarding technology and its dangers.  But this time around, I am torn between being absolutely disheartened and disgusted by my father’s passivity and obliviousness and my mother’s deceit and lies and gullibility…and feeling guilty for thinking such mean things about the people who raised me.  I feel like my reserve of respect and love for both of them is quickly diminishing.

 

I don’t want to feel this way about my mom and dad.  I know intellectually that the financial problem and the relationship between them is not mine to fix, but the emotional toll when I think about them with anger, disgust, and contempt is really painful.  What can I do to move on??

 

TL;DR – My mother has been scammed twice (for $$$$) by random internet strangers she had emotional affairs with, while my father sits by passively.  How can I stop feeling anger and disgust at them both?


Also, sorry for any funky formatting with the paragraphs.

"My girlfriend [30F] and I [23M] are just around the corner from ""the rest of our lives."" She's ready to buy a $300K house, get married, and start having kids. I don't think I'm ready and I'm terrified for what our future holds.


We have been together for almost exactly two years and have lived together for 3 months. She is very settled in her career and makes a considerable amount more than I do. I have just recently started what I hope will be my career, it's the first time in my life that I am making what I consider, ""real money."" I would not consider myself settled into my new career or lifestyle by any means, because it is so new to me. Her and I have talked about marriage, kids and a life together an extensive amount, but it never really seemed that real to me until we moved in together and these dreams are always talked about. It seems like she can't go a day without talking about our dream home, or how we would raise our kids, how I need to buy a ring or propose. This constant resonance of our possible future has made it all too real and now I'm lost with what will happen with our relationship.

TL;DR: My girlfriend is ready to commit 100% to every aspect of happily ever after and I don't think that I'm ready for that. "
"My[M27] GF[F25] of 6 years has been going out of town one week out of every month so far this year.


So I live within a short drive to Atlanta, GA. My SO usually goes to Atlanta every year in April for an art convention and she and a group of friends all rent a hotel by together and enjoy the weekend-long con. I have been fine with her going every year for 6 years now. Everything is normally fine, she may stay an extra couple of days after the con is over and unwind before eventually heading back home. But this year has been different. 

I didn't realize just how much she was leaving town until last night I went back through our texts and discovered that she has gone on a trip every single month this year. Every trip has been 7 days or more, and EVERY trip, she gives me an excuse for why she has to stay a few extra days(at one point she stayed an extra 5 days). She's always very vague like, ""I'm just feeling sick"", or ""no one could give me a ride to the shuttle""(which she takes rather than driving on her own because she's terrified of driving on the highway), or some other excuse. 

What triggered my curiosity recently is that she said she went to an urgent care center in ATL because she said she had strep throat. She said she didn't realize that her insurance didn't work at that location so she has a $400 bill to pay. Recently I called a random urgent care  in ATL and they estimated that a swab for strep plus the office visit cost without insurance would only be around $185. Later she comes home after one trip and says she needs to go to urgent care because she thinks she may have a UTI. 

All of this seemed okay to me. But then I noticed that my mail key(we live in an apt) disappeared off of my keyring. My keyring isn't one of those hiking ones that clip on, it is a standard ring you have to twist off. Okay, so maybe I somehow lost my key. I text her while she's out of town and ask her about the key, and she has no idea, but she offers to buy one from the leasing office when she gets back since I'm broke. Okay, sure np. 

Well one day my gut told me to go to the office and get one anyway and I did. I got the very last copy of our mail key apparently. Well in the mail I found a letter for her the urgent care she visited back home and I opened it(illegal I know, but I resealed it and put it back in the box). It had her charges on there and one of the charges was for a pregnancy test. Come to find out, they do offer to do those when testing for UTI, but only do one if you tell them that there's a reason you may be pregnant. Here's the thing, we haven't had sex in months. Every time I advance she says she's tired or on her period(which seems more often than normal, but I haven't been keeping track of her cycle). 

Then after another trip she has her OB/GYN appointment. She tells me afterwards that they cut something out of her without telling her they would do that. I was furious. I said we needed to go up there and find out why the hell they would do that and that we should sue. She shuts me down completely saying she doesn't want to talk about it and how embarrassing it was for her to have someone inside of her and all that. Okay, fine. 

Before she left for this trip, she said she wanted me to format her external hard drive because it she needs it to work for her Mac and PC. I told her after she left that I'd be willing  to fix it while shes gone, but I need her password. All of a sudden she wants to watch  me do it, so she can learn how to do that kind of stuff, when she's never before showed any interest in learning about  computers. 

I'm at a point now where she just extended her current trip 4 more days and I don't know if I'm being a psycho or not, but none of this is adding up to me. I'm currently waiting for her to get back to ""get another key"". If she comes back one day and has a key and says she got it from the office, I will know she's lying. If she gets the mail and there's no letter for her from urgent care, or if she doesn't tell me about the pregnancy test, I know she's lying. All in all, am I crazy or is this justified? Are there any other ways I can figure out what she is up to?

**TL;DR;** : My GF is acting odd, spending weeks out of town, and has questionable medical bills. "
"I (33F) would like to be engaged to my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We have been discussing marriage and children for years but are not engaged. I am done waiting.


Hi, this is my first post so I hope I get the format right. I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years, we are in a committed relationship and live together. I have also moved across the country 3 times for him so he can grow his business. I thought that things would happen organically like being engaged but they didn't. I am done waiting.

There is no question about whether we love each other, we do beyond doubt and he is the love of my life. But, I am ready to and want to start a family together. Whether that means getting engaged or starting to try for a child.

We have talked about this so many times over the course of our relationship, stuff like 'I can't wait until we have children and ...' and also more serious conversations like how I really want to get married.

I have reached the point where I have made it very clear that I want commitment and I am concerned about waiting and having fertility problems. It got to the point where I issued an ultimatum, I am ready to and would like to start a future and family with him. If he is not ready I will move on with my life. The ultimatum was not to force him to propose, it was to find out whether we have a future and to get actions rather than words. If I never became a mother  I could regret it.

He said he does want to get married to me and have children one day, but not right now. He said it's not a great time as he's busy building his business and would like to be more financially stable. He also feels like I sprung this on him with the ultimatum (disregarding the discussions over the years).

He doesn't have a great concept of time, and I am the realist and if we need to be somewhere at a certain time, have something organised in advance its me. He said he thinks maybe he is just being a coward but I also should have just waited until he was ready which was the end of the year. But he told me 3 years ago it would be the new year.

After the ultimatum he got a ring designed (he picked ring, if it was up to me it would be a cheap fake diamond). But this is now on hold because it's been 3 weeks since my I have had enough ultimatum and I had enough and went home to my family.

I have also made it clear that expensive ring and extravagant proposal are not important to me. So it's not a money thing. All I asked is that he ask my parents for my hand in marriage out of respect. He asked his parents but not mine. I feel that by not asking by parents, or proposing to me, he hasn't shown commitment or done something he is accountable for.

My fear is that I have doomed this already by issuing an ultimatum, and my other fear is that if I hung around I would still just keep waiting and effect my fertility rate even more. The whole proposal thing seems very dated in that for one of the biggest decisions of our lives, I have to wait to be asked. I could ask him but he wants this part of the relationship to be traditional.

Has anyone ever been in this situation and how did it turn out? 

TL/DR I want commitment (marriage / start family) with boyfriend, he is not ready. Issued ultimatum and am done waiting.

"My [26M] father [50sM] just announced that he is going to marry my fiancee of four years' [28F] mother [50sF]


((Throwaway because the fam reddits))

The title.............pretty much says it all. Last night, I took my fiancee out to dinner with my entire extended family. I was planning on announcing our wedding plans (and asking my brother to be my best man) at the end of the event. However......

At the start of the dinner, before we had even been brought our foods, my father stood up and asked for everyone's attention. He said that he had met a wonderful new woman, that she had taught him to see the sunshine again, that he had never been happier. We were all overjoyed- my father has been deeply depressed since my mother died of cancer eight years ago, and we couldn't believe that he was happy again.

And then my fiancee's mother walked in.

My father said, ""This is \[fiancee's mother\]. I am so happy to introduce you all to her, although, of course, you may already know her daughter, \[tthrowaway27's fiancee\]. I am so happy to introduce her as my future stepdaughter, and I hope to see all of you at our wedding this November!""

My fiancee and I were SHOCKED. We had no idea that our parents were dating at all, and it made the rest of the dinner uncomfortable for us because, a), we could no longer announce our own wedding, and b), people kept clapping her on the back and telling her what a phenomenal older sister she would be. Which, gross.

What hurts most about this whole thing is that I have been VERY open with my father about my wedding plans and how much I love my fiancee, and I even told him that I was going to announce that we were going to get married last night. He knows that I have been keeping it a secret from the rest of the family due to various past relationships (and some superstition), and it feels like he purposefully announced his engagement to my fiancee's mother so that I couldn't marry my own fiancee. He even scheduled his '''wedding''' before my own.

I am incredibly happy that he's happy again, and I do believe that that was sincere. I believe that he loves this woman. But I cannot believe that he has done this!

\*\*tl;dr\*\* My father announced his engagement to my fiancee's mother the same night that I told him that I was planning on announcing my own engagement to my fiancee. Wtf do I do???"
"I (27f) asked a guy (mid20s) out and now I feel dumb


I am a cashier. There is this guy who comes into my store once in a while. About 2 months ago he came in and I realized that I felt attracted to him, He is always very polite, smiles, says hello and I am the same way...

 The last few times I have seen him at the store I get nervous and it is pretty obvious and embarrassing. I am usually not a shy person but he makes me really nervous.

 Anyway, I decided last week that the next time I saw him I would talk to him. Today the store was really busy and he came in and decided to go to one of the other cashiers. When I saw him, we made eye contact and we smiled. I signaled to him to come to my lane and he Did. When it was time to serve him he made a joke about how I dropped his money last time he saw me and I laughed and said it wouldn't happen today. I was shaking guys!!!! 

I asked him about his plans for the rest of the day and he said that he wasn't really doing much. And that is when I said ""maybe we should go out for coffee one day"" he said ""do you want to?"" And looked excited so I said ""yes!""... He then told me that he would be back to grab my number and I said Okay.

 He never came back and i already left the store for the week. He is pretty good looking, and I don't consider myself to be ugly.. I always thought he was into me too which is why I asked him. Now I feel so dumb and frustrated. I usually dont ask guys out, so this is a big deal to me. How do I even serve him next time? I guess I just wanted to rant.


**bolded**TLDR: asked guy out, he said he would get my number later but never came back. Now I feel dumb."
"BF (30s) totally appalled that I (F30s) have asked him to pay half of the house bills


I really need some advice here on whether I'm out of line or making a reasonable request. This post is long, but I want to be fair and give context and background to this dilemma.

 My partner and I have lived together for a few years now. When we first bought our house, I had a considerably higher income than him, and so we split the house bills proportionately to reflect that. A few months after we moved in, I offered to take over paying one of his bills because he found the previously agreed budget too much for him to manage in practice (he has child maintenance and legal bills from a previous relationship to pay for). It's stayed this way since, and he's never offered to take it back.

Since the original agreement was made, both our employment circumstances have changed. He has been promoted and now also has a second job working from home at night or weekends (completely flexible and he does it when he chooses) while I have taken a less well-paid job to avoid redundancy and unemployment. What hasn't changed is the division of our household bills. I am still paying considerably more monthly bills towards our house than he is. He does pay for dates, most take-outs and  car repairs, but I see most of these as non-essentials we can cut back on if needs be. I have wanted to reassess this financial dynamic for around 18 months, and I originally brought it up by laying out all of our household bills and respective incomes (not including his second job) and asking if there was a way to even this out a little more and perhaps have a clearer budget for dates and take-out that would leave both of us feeling more financially secure, while obviously lightening a little of the financial load for me. He was completely against the idea and went on an aggressive rant about how he has so much credit card debt, legal bills and child maintenance to pay, whereas I do not. Actually I have both tonnes of credit card debt (a lot of it from home improvements, but not all) and a child of my own to pay for. Anyways, I left that conversation where it was 18 months ago to avoid conflict and let things continue the way they were.

Fast forward to the present situation. I have less net income than I used to from changing jobs, although I still earn more than BF if you exclude his second job, which he has been doing for nearly two years.He now wants to explore turning his second job into his full time, primary source of income.  From this second job, he has paid for some home improvements, the vast majority of dates, and most recently a lovely holiday. But he's tallying up these things more and more as a gloating exercise and a reason to accuse me of not being appreciative enough of him. Ironically, I've never asked him to regularly thank me for paying for our house, and hes never once said thanks for this either. He also regularly accuses me of not doing enough housework and claims that he does most of it (which is not true, as we divided household chores when we first moved in together and we still largely stick to this). If anything else needs done around the house, he looks to me accusatoraly for not having done it first. 

The holiday he paid for, and now casts back to me at every opportunity, has actually prompted me to assert that we open a joint account and pay a fixed sum into it each month in order to split the house bills and money for dates and holidays 50:50. I have asked that he use the income from his second job to contribute to this. Once again, I laid out all our monthly expenses, including shopping and other things that he pays for, and showed him that if we split this evenly, he won't be paying out any more money than he has been recently. I also said I hoped it reduced the arguments about who pays for what. His side of the argument is that his second income is not reliable enough to do this, and it will mean he has to work longer hours to meet this new arrangement. He says im taking advantage of his generosity and 'a few good months' of income. He even told me yesterday that because I earn more than him and get child benefit for my child, I should be giving a portion of that to him and contributing to his welfare payments. I  think this is ludicrous and he is being inflammatory to deflect from the real reason he doesn't want to do this: he wants me to keep shouldering the responsibility for the house bills and he wants to keep his second income to do what he wants with. But he's proved for a while now through things he's paid for, that he can make more than enough money to cover the 50:50 split, and he has said he wants to make this second job his main one. So who is being unreasonable here? Me, who is on paper the main earner, or him, who doesn't want his second source of employment to be included in the overall household income?

TL:DR - I earn more than BF in my main job, so I've been paying most bills. But I want to include his second income to split the bills more fairly and he doesn't."
"I’m [19M] going through my sister’s [20F] stuff, so she’ll have clothes in rehab. Found a planner, and now I’m on my feelings.


Howdy, Reddit. This is a throwaway, obviously, because I need the opportunity to decompress and disassociate with my regular Reddit-activities. I apologize in advance for how long this is, but I just started writing an hour ago and couldn’t stop.

I have two “full” sisters and two half sisters, but my focus today will be solely on the sister that’s directly older than me; I’ll call her Mary.

Mary, my youngest sister, and I endured one hell of an upbringing. We survived the nastiness of my parent’s divorce, constant custody switches between two cities, alcoholism, drug abuse, my father being stabbed by my cousin, and my mother tackling my youngest sister down two stairs. To put it bluntly, my childhood was shitty. 

As a child/preteen/teenager, I found solace in online gaming communities and a long-lasting addiction to computer games (namely World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing since I was 8.) I managed to survive my younger years by dodging familial get-togethers, my favorite aunt’s funeral, and any meaningful emotional interaction period. I escaped this mentality by pushing myself towards performing arts and became a mildly successful performer and director (on a local scale, anyway.) While I’m still young and have my love of theatre to fall back on, I think that I’ll be permanently scarred by my previous insecurities and trauma. I work through that everyday by maintaining two retail jobs, a full college career, and an amazing boyfriend who attribute a lot of my success to.

Mary, however, is a different story. She’s incredibly talented- incredibly smart, unbelievably cultured, and THE MOST attractive member of my family. However, she wasn’t saved from our family poison. Addiction befell her, and she began experimenting the drugs around the age of 12 (middle school.) It began with prescription medication her dumbass friends shared with her at an “All Night Skate,” and quickly escalated to her skipping school and doing drugs with people she barely knew. She started with marijuana (which I have no problem with, whatsoever) around the age of 14, but then became a serial abuser and partier by the age of 17. She made a series of very bad decisions including transferring to an out-of-state college when she wasn’t prepared, partying with undesirable friends that left her naked and alone in the middle of New York City, and wrecking two cars (both drug related incidents.)

While she was out of state, the whole family was worried sick about her. She eventually overdosed again, and we decided it was time for her to move back to town. We thought everything would be fine, but then she attended a pill party and overdosed on a concoction of inhalants (doctors said it was most likely a mix of cocaine, crushed up ketamine and Xanax.) She drove herself to a local hospital, was baker acted, and now here we are.

While going through some of her old books, I stumbled across a planner. The planner was almost entirely blank and missing A LOT of dates. There were only three dates. It’s one of those fun little planners that has sections like, “Things I’m Grateful For” and “Things I’m Excited About.” On one of the three dates, underneath the “Affirmation” section, Mary wrote this: “You are sick, but still trying hard.”

I had to stop everything. I shouldn’t have read it. My perception of my sister has never changed- I absolutely love her and care for her, but now my heart aches beyond relief. I can’t even manage a single tear right now.

I don’t know exactly why I’m posting this, but this is all I could think to do. Please, someone, let me know if there’s anything more I could do than I’m already doing. I’ve missed so many important dates/family gatherings/birthdays/weddings because of work and school, but I don’t think I can shut my family out anymore.

Tl;Dr,   My sister Mary and I endured a very troubling childhood, and are in completely different circumstances. While helping her out, I stumbled across a journal page that broke my heart with one sentence. Let me know what I can do.

"My [31] wife [27] is trying to convince me to let our son spend every other weekend with her ex [28].


My wife and I have been together for 6 years, married for 5. She has an 8-year-old son Jake from a previous relationship. Her ex was very irresponsible, got arrested multiple times, and was involved in shady activity, basically leaving her as a single mother. She moved an hour away from the city to where she met me. Jake was just one years old. I basically took in her son as my own and I am very close to him. We have our own son Matt who is 4 years old and Jake was a great big brother to him. They have gotten very close. 

2 years ago her “baby daddy” came back into the picture. He had some sob story about how he nearly died and had an epiphany and turned his life around. He had a decent job, cleaned himself up and said he wanted to be part of his son's life.  He apologized for everything and said that he wanted to a part of his son’s life. My wife is a very trusting and forgiving person so after determining he had really ""changed"" she didn’t really pose any objection to giving partial custody despite him abandoning her for years and said it was best for Jake. (I thought it was a bad idea but she insisted) As of now Jake sees his dad every other weekend (he’s picked up Friday evening and dropped back at our house Sunday evening. We have had some issues with his father not ensuring that he does his homework and occasionally cancelling meetings last minutes but for the most part he’s been pretty committed to the task. 

The issue is that Jake's father has committed to doing “fun tasks” with his son. He often takes them to the movies, to sports games, amusement parks, bowling, family parties, etc.. I honestly don’t know where he gets the money to do this but it seems like EVERY TIME they go out he takes him to do something. It’s gotten to the point where Jake is so incredibly eager to hang out with his dad since he is the “fun and cool parent” while his mom is the strict boring mom and I am the corny loser that’s “technically not even his real dad” (his words). This kind of hurts since I practically raised the kid but it is what it is. What’s a bigger issue is that Matt, our son has become jealous of Jake’s trips and expressed desire to go with his brother when he gets picked up by his dad. 

2 days my wife brought up the possibility of letting Matt go with Jake when his dad picks her up. She said that she and her ex had talked about it and he was very willing to bring him along and she thought it was a great idea that would allow Matt and Jake to bond more and would remove any ""jealousy"" in their relationship.  Obviously I was completely against this and thought she was crazy. No way, was I letting another man act as a “fun parent” to my kid. 

I told her this and she said she had already talked to Matt about the possibility and he was really excited about it (I thought was manipulative and immature to talk to him without consulting with me). I argued that her ex wasn’t exactly the most responsible guy and I didn’t want my son to spend time with him. She then got REALLY offended and accused me of preferring Matt over Jake and that if her ex is good enough to spend time with Jake why isn’t he good enough for Matt? She then said she thought I viewed Jake as a son,This made me angry because it’s not as if I agreed for her ex to have partial custody of Jake. It was her idea and I objected to but it’s impossible to change her mind so I didn’t put up much of a fight. To turn that against me was just ridiculous.  She is still insisting on me allowing this and thinks I'm being selfish and immature

I’ve talked to some of my friend about this and some think my wife is crazy while some think I should just give in and that we would enjoy the time without kids. I just wanted some advice from reddit. Should I just give in for the sake of keeping the peace or should I put up a fight? 

TL:DR- My wife has a kid with her ex and they share custody. My wife wants to allow her ex to take our son together out when he picks up his kid. I object to this.

"My family is blaming me (31M) for reporting my sister's (23F) hit and run


To avoid exposing anyone's personal information, details are going to be fairly vague. I haven't really spoken to many people IRL about this, but this feels a little less personal, so I guess I'm going here.

I've always been very close with my little sister. We grew up broke, and our parents had to work their asses off to provide for us, so they weren't around often. I was the father figure for my sister. She's a good kid, she's really smart and strong-willed, but she's got bad anxiety and is very reserved. But whenever she's got problems, she comes to me first. I'm her walking talking diary, and it's a good feeling. All I want to do is protect her and keep her safe. She's beyond my best friend.

A while ago, she came to my house in tears. She was screaming and crying, shaking a lot too. I got her calmed down after an hour, and she told me that while she was driving to a late night shift at work, she'd hit a man running across the street. It was dark out, she hadn't been able to see him, and she just hit him. I just told her the truth, she'd done a hit and run, and she needed to call 911. My sister started crying and begging me not to call, saying she wasn't ready and she couldn't go to jail, and our parents would be so disappointed. It just broke my heart. She would've never done this on purpose, and I could tell it was destroying her as much as it was me. Hitting him was an accident, and it wasn't even her fault. Driving away was a stupid, impulsive mistake, and she was freaked out. I didn't want to call. I seriously, really didn't. Whenever I'd reach for the phone, she would grab me and break into hysterics, begging me and begging me not to call. I hid in my bathroom, locked the door, and called the police on my baby sister.

Obviously, she was arrested and has been hit with a hefty amount of time to serve, along with a fine. Giving her up like that was honestly one of the most heartbreaking moments of my entire life. I cried with her, and I didn't want to do anything for days after. I've just been depressed and miserable, and I keep replaying the entire night back in my head, wondering what I could've done to help. 

Anyways, my whole family is just self-destructing. My parents are freaking out, everything has been just completely falling apart. Of course, all the blame is on me. My family believes that if I hadn't called, that we could've fixed it independently of law enforcement and things would be fine. I'm just so torn up by it. I want to fix this. I want to figure out how to feel better about this situation, how to really get to my parents and tell them how badly I'm hurting.

Advice?

tl;dr; I reported my sister's hit and run to the police and my parents are blaming me."
"I [22/F] am hurt by a comment my [35?/M] co-worker made but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.


Hi all, 

Using a throwaway just because. 

I recently got a new job at a family owned construction company. This is a really great job. The hours, pay, benefits, and I get a long with all of my co-workers. I am the newbie, as I've only been here for 3 months. Everyone else has been here for a very long time. 

I don't know them very well yet, but everyone has been super nice. Yesterday my co-worker brought in his daughters. I don't have a problem with this at all. His three year old was so adorable, and his six month old was also very sweet. I'm the receptionist and everyone was in the reception area, talking to my co-worker and his daughter. Since I was new he introduced me to his daughter. I was polite and said hi, she was a little shy, understandably so. She was very sweet and would talk to me, and I would respond but also go back to working. I don't know them very well, so I wasn't really sure what to say, but again I wasn't rude. (At least I don't think so.)

Throughout the times she would talk to me, I was very unsure on how to interact. About six months ago I had a late term miscarriage. I was completely devastated about losing my son. I still struggle with it but it has been slowly getting somewhat better. 

As they were leaving my co-worker asked his daughter if she would day by to everyone. I quietly said bye and waved. 

This morning my co-worker approached me about yesterday. He asked how I liked meeting his daughter, I told him it was sweet and pleasure to meet her since I had only seen photos. He responded with ""Oh, really?"" I was super confused. His tone of voice seemed very shocked that I enjoyed meeting them. He went on to say how obviously uncomfortable and awkward I was interacting with them. That he also told his wife and she thought it was weird too. I honestly didn't know how to respond. I just said ""Oh. I'm sorry."" and walked away. 

I've been sitting at my desk racking my brain on how I could have done it differently. I feel so horrible. I know my co-worker didn't know about my loss, but it still hurt. I won't lie, when thinking about it now, I did feel hurt when meeting them. I was reminded of what I could have had. I feel like this normal, but maybe I'm overreacting. 

I talked about it with my fiance and he told me I wasn't. He told me there were a few times he met his co-worker kids and it brought up some very raw emotions, and he wasn't sure how to interact either. 

I'm not sure if I should tell my co-worker that his comment hurt. I'm not really sure what to do. So what should I do? 

*tl;dr: Yesterday my co-worker brought his daughters in to work. Six months ago I had a late term miscarriage and it still hurts. I didn't really know how to interact and I felt awkward. I was polite and interacted the best I could. Today he confronted me and told me I was being super awkward and made it uncomfortable. I feel bad because I didn't mean to but I'm hurt by his comment. What do I do?*"
"Wife (29) Husband (30) I have significant resentment towards my husband and I'm not sure how to save our 8 month marriage


Background: My husband and I dated for 7 years before getting married. We survived many things including being long distance for about 1 year. We both wanted to complete personal goals prior to getting married (finances, business, college etc.). We have always considered ourselves to have a healthy relationship despite a few pretty big blow ups over the years over disagreements on how we see the world. He is an INTJ and I am an INFJ (not that this truly says anything) but he is definitely more logical while I am more on the emotional side. Many of arguments have stemmed from him downplaying things that I believe in or feel. For example, it took him a long time to understand mental health is real (depression, anxiety etc.). I have always known him to be quite stubborn and accepted that I would have to deal with that before marrying him. He also promised me countless number of times he would work on this and work on his communication also as he often times shuts down or ignores me when he is upset. I promised that I would work on my anger and my listening skills as well as trying to be more accepting of his views. I worked really hard on this. I don't feel like he has kept up his promises to me.

Present: We both have our bad habits like anyone else. Our married life started off great in my perspective. I was really enjoying being around him. However, I noticed that his affect changed over time. He would leave whatever room I am in and go in his phone, he started to become more irritable. He said that this has nothing to do with me and that he feels ""stuck"" in life because he is not doing the things he wants to do in life. He has admitted that he has lost all motivation and a lot of hope but won't admit to being depressed. He states that he doesn't like to talk to me about these things because I don't ""help"" him and I tell him things that he can't really relate to like what works for me is prayer or networking, or etc.  Also, now that we are married and I see him everyday and he is irritable...he ignores things I say almost on the daily. Simple things like, ""can you grab me that cup of water"" will get no answer but he will later bring it. One day I was telling him how I felt about something (calmly) , he stared at me turned around and started vacuuming. He then tried to justify it by saying that since he looked at me that is acknowledgement. Not too long before that I explained to him AGAIN how ignoring me makes me feel horrible. He then realized that he was wrong after a couple hours and finally apologized for it.

Honestly, since then I have become VERY resentful towards him because it literally feels that  I have asked him to stop the behavior a million and half time. He says things like, ""I don't want to talk because I know what I'm capable of"" but I don't think that justifies straight up ignoring someone. I am definitely a talker perhaps too much sometimes but all I want is to be able to solve our issues by sitting down and talking about them. Now, everything that I accepted about him before and could tolerate before I know HATE. I can't stand to look at him because all I see is stubborness, lack of motivation, dishonesty (he is not honest about his feelings), and someone who has a hard time understanding me. I feel that I can't stand him and I am giving up hope. I just thought he was a bit more receptive than he actually is. I feel so dumb. I've known this person for more than 8 years and I tried to do everything I could to have a good relationship and now 8 month's in and I resent him? I am not sure how to move forward. We just don't know how to solve issues.

Our latest fight was just this morning. We are visiting family at the moment, He stated that he had to go visit a friend. I told him since we haven't hung out in a while, why don't we go get something to eat first and then he can meet up with his friend (this is a friend I know of but have never met). I told him since I have never met this friend and they seem pretty close how about we go get the food and then I can drop him off at this friend's house and he can introduce us. He immediately says ""no"" and sounds annoyed. I became annoyed because he always says no to me for simple things. I told him that I really wanted to go and I didn't understand what the big deal was. He says, ""I just want to be able to leave when I want to leave"". I told him that I have a friend in the same area and I can go spend time with her while he spends time with his friend so he wouldn't have to wait on me. He insisted, ""no"". Finally I got the keys and I started to go on my way I asked him if he was coming along for breakfast he says ""no"". I left on my own. I didn't even buy anything. Once I returned, he started looking for his keys to go. I just honestly feel like I hate him. All I wanted to do was at least spend time with the idiot and he doesn't see that. I'm just so exhausted and tired of explaining to someone how to love me. We have talked about love languages, we have texted instead of talked. I feel like I've tried everything and what seems to work 1 week does not work another week.

At this point, I resent him and I can't stand being around him. It's really scary because when I got married of course giving up was not an option in my book but I am really tired. I know these things seem petty but imagine going through this every second of your life? This is an almost everyday thing. I told him that I can't even remember what he likes about me. My beliefs bother him, my music bothers him etc. It's like everything I do he finds the need to say "" I don't like that"" when I am so accepting of his crap. He says, ""I don't tell you not to do anything you love"". He doesn't but he won't partake in anything I like anymore. 

TDLR: It's 8 months into our marriage and I feel dumb. I feel that I don't even know my husband after we've already dated for 7 years. He more stubborn and irritable and states that it is because he is ""stuck"" in life and that it's not because of me. I feel like shit anyway and don't know how to save our marriage. I can't stand him."
"My [40F] daughter [23F] has gotten involved with a dangerous boyfriend [20sM]


Hi all.

My daughter, Rebecca, is a lovely girl. I got pregnant at 17 and her father deserted us. I raised her on my own (with support from my parents and friends). I spent a lot of time with her while at the same time holding down a job and working my way up. Eventually I set up my own business and was able to move us into a more comfortable area. 

Rebecca is a lovely young woman. She did well at school, had lots of friends, and unlike me never got into any trouble. She went to university and already has a well-paid job for a big company in the city. 

In terms of relationships, every boy she ever brought home was a genuinely nice, honest and friendly guy. Obviously all those relationships ended, and the latest one ended in heartbreak when he cheated on her. Because of this she's been upset and has been going out drinking/clubbing with friends a lot more. 

Unfortunately she met and brought home this guy called Danny one night a few months back, and ever since then they've been together. He's literally vile. A quick google search reveals quite a few violent criminal convictions. He's been to prison twice and is constantly in and out of jobs. He's got a new job and been fired three times in the last few months. He brings his friends to hang around our house drinking and smoking most nights. He's made at least one racist comment (which was very offensive to me since my granddad is a black man from Nigeria, though since me and Rebecca both look white, Sam doesn't seem to realise this). He also said something to her about ''not being allowed'' in a certain area, and when I was growing up a comment like that usually means you're gang affiliated. 

However, the most disgusting thing is that he tried to come onto me a few weeks ago. He said ''what Rebecca doesn't know won't hurt her''. Obviously I refused and told Rebecca immediately. Shockingly, she accused me of lying. She'd rather believe this vile man over her own mother. 

Worse than that, she went out with him and his friends last Saturday. I got a call in the early hours of the morning to pick her up from the police station. Apparently they went down to the railway tracks to smoke weed, and were arrested by covert police. They've all been charged with trespassing on the railway, and Rebecca has additionally been charged with possessing cannabis, since Sam apparently thought ''the rich city worker would get away with it''. It's not likely she'll go to prison since she's never been in trouble before and the charges aren't serious, but she'll get a criminal record. Although she's still at work, this could seriously affect her long term career/professional reputation. 

She's still decided to stick by him. We had a long argument where I insisted that he's not good for her and tried to point out that he pinned the drugs onto her. She insisted that she loves him and that they had a future together. I don't know how to get through to her that this man is seriously bad news.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My daughter got involved with a very dangerous man, and is now likely to get a criminal record because of it. "
"I [22f] went on one date with a guy [24m] who was really nice but I think might be in the middle of a mental breakdown. Am I under any obligation to see that he gets help? If not, do I ghost him?


Hello r/relationships. 

Quick backstory, I'm just finished up a summer class. I had sort of a crush on the TA who was a really good looking, very insightful, helpful, truly nice guy. The class ended Wednesday so I told him Id like to stay in touch. He asked if I was free Saturday and I said yes. I was super excited because I really like him. 


We went out to dinner and for the first bit he was totally cool and I was having a nice time because he was essentially the same guy that had been in class with us. It was almost like a switch turned and he started talking about the craziest stuff. I mean like beyond anti-vaxx and flat earth because these were things he was convince were happening to and because of him. 

I don't want to go into huge detail because I know he's on reddit but lets just say he talked about aliens, secret martial arts tournaments, being watched by the government and he always felt like he was being followed. 

It was so sad because beyond that, he is a REALLY good guy. I mean like a type of guy who could have the world open up for him socially, romantically, professionally, you name it. 


Am I under any obligation to see that he gets help? I know his family lives in town and he was really good friends with our professor so I could tell them. Or is this a situation I need to just stay out of?

If I stay out of it, do I explain why? Or do I just ghost him and hope I don't run into him again?

tl;dr: Guy I went on a  single  date with may be in the middle of a mental breakdown. Am I under any obligation to see that he gets help? Or do I back away, if I do that do I explain myself or do I just ghost him?

"After our daughter (17f) died, my (38f) family has been falling apart


My husband and I have very different approaches to how we parent our 17 yr. old twins. He really wants to enforce rules and structure, but I was raised that way and just hated it, so I’ve always given the kids some leniency. Our girls, Mary and Jo, graduated this past June, and wanted to go to a bonfire thrown by a friend of their’s. My husband was super against it, but I really fought for them to be able to go, and he let them, but was a little peeved. We live out in the country, and the house they were going to was about ten miles out. Taking the proper roads, it’s more of a hike, but there’s a shortcut through some dense forest lining a ravine.

The girls left, and Mary told us that she’d be staying with a friend, but Jo was going home after. The next morning, no Jo. We called Mary, and said that Jo had too much to drink at the bonfire, and they’d gotten into a big fight before they left. Mary said that a friend had promised to get Jo home. The friend told us that his house was in the opposite direction, and he didn’t want to break curfew, so he left her at the edge of the woods, and went home.

After they found the body, the police said that Jo had no light, and got lost. She slipped off the path, fell into the ravine, and was knocked out. When she fell, she went face down into the stream that runs through the ravine. It was barely enough water to cover her, but she still drowned.

Ever since, we’ve been falling apart. My husband cries in Jo’s bedroom everyday, and he takes all of his grief out on me. Of course, I feel responsible. But I’m trying to absolve myself of that, and he puts the blame so heavily on my shoulders. I’d say that we fight, but he just screams. He’ll ask me how I’d like to die alone and afraid. Sometimes, he’ll get all quiet and start talking about how Jo died, and how scared she was of the woods in the dark, and how awful it must’ve been. He always ends it with talking about how the worst thing was being lead into it by me. I asked him to try counseling with me, but he gets angry and refuses.

It hurts Mary, too. She hears us fighting, and she just breaks. She feels just as responsible, and we’ve come to lean on each other for comfort. My husband will try to pit her against me. He’ll say that Jo would still be alive if I hadn’t let them go to the party. He tells her that I’m not a good mother, I’m not careful enough. It puts Mary through so much.

I’m scared. Is my marriage over? What can we do?

Tl;dr: My husband and I’s daughter died, and our family is falling apart."
"My [24M] girlfriend [24F] and I combined finances a year ago. I want to undo it. Is there any way to ask without torpedoing the relationship?


We've been together for 4.5 years now. We're legally common-law and neither of us have any interest in getting married. We bought a house together last year and decided it would just be more simple if we were to combine finances at that point. It went okay, however I noticed that she spends her money quite liberally.. where I'm really frugal. She likes to treat herself to expensive lattes, premium makeup, etc, and I've always liked to just squirrel my money away. There's nothing wrong with what she does - she still saves and has no trouble paying her bills, we just view it differently I guess.

She recently got a new job and she's now making almost on-par with what I earn. I've been feeling stressed the last few months about her spending habits, however couldn't really ask her to tone it down. She wasn't being irresponsible.. again just spending her money more freely than myself.. someone who is admittedly very frugal. I don't want to take a step back in our relationship (we've both expressed we're essentially married without the legality of it) but I want to separate finances again. It's a good time now that she's earning similar to what I am. I don't know how to ask her without making her think I'm stepping back.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Tried combining finances a year ago with girlfriend. Went ok, however I've noticed I'm much more frugal and would rather re-separate them again. How can I eloquently ask?"
"My husband [M26] and I [F26] moved away from home, 1,500 miles, 3 years ago and now my in-laws are wanting to move out to us.


My husband (then fiancé) and I moved from our home state after college across the country for jobs. Since then we have gotten married and settled down very well. We love our life out here. For myself and my parents the move has been amazing. We love better at a distance! However, my husband is a total mama and daddy's boy. He loves his parents, talks to them every day and that is one of the many things I love about him. And it makes me love him more that he was willing to follow my so far away from them. In the 3 years since our move, we have become so much closer and I haven't had to feel like 'I share him' since we moved. I felt like that often before we moved, but it was all I knew until we moved. Now my in-laws have been at our house visiting the past 2 weeks and it is driving me crazy and making me terrified for when they move out here. They are great people, but can be overbearing. They are pushing kids, change things in my house, and steal almost all of my husbands attention. I know it's because they dont see each other often, but I just can't shake this guy feeling that when they move here, my husband will always be at their house, just for a quick visit, every day and I will never have my husband to myself. Yes, I know, I need to set boundaries, but here is the wrench...my FIL has stage 4 head and neck cancer. He had a radical surgery followed by intense chemo and radiation and his last 2 scans have been clean, but this cancer has a 95% reoccurrence rate. This makes my husband feel like he has to spend every second with his father and makes me feel like a selfish person for complaining. 

I am asking for advice on how to deal with this or approach it when or before it becomes an issue when they have moved here. Honestly, I love the life we have and wish they weren't coming out here, but their house is for sale and there is no going back on that front. 

**TL;DR My husband and I live 1,500 miles away from family. My husband is a mama and daddy's boy. I'm scared he will forget about me.**"
"BF's (30M) Mom (60+F) gets very touchy feely with both her sons. Is this normal?


I just went on a wonderful vacation to Mexico with my (30F) BF's (30M) family. We have been together for about a year and his family lives in a different state. We had a great time and I absolutely loved getting to know his parents. They are so warm and welcoming!

The only (maybe?) strange thing was that his family is suuuuper touchy-feely.  Now my family isn't shy about touching. We love to give big bear hugs and if we are watching TV we might curl up and put a head on each other's shoulders or link arms. If my parents are sore or tired, I'll give them a foot or back rub. I have a little sister with sensory issues, so we always ask her first before touching, but even she will hug and shower us with ILOVEYOU's. My parents will slow dance and smootch in the kitchen while dinner is cooking. And for some people my family isn't their normal and would be overwhelming, but his family makes mine look like a bunch of stuffy prudes. 

His family (Brother M27, Parents 60+) were all over each other. I actually think it is nice to see families hug, kiss, and put arms around each other. But his mom went a bit further. Like my boyfriend would be in his bathing suit and she would come up from behind and wrap her arms around him and caress his chest while nuzzling his neck. She also did that once while my boyfriend and I were kissing. She came up from behind him, pressed her body against his, and started caressing his arms while he and I were having a moment. It stopped the moment. My boyfriend and I slept on a pull out couch in the main living area and one morning he was curled up on top of me with his head on my chest and I played with my hair. His mom came out of her room and laid on top of him (keep in mind she was in a little nightie and he was just in underwear) and stroked his back and snuggled up...so they both were on top of me. It looked so intimate that I had a flashback of a threesome I once had back in college.

His brother and his mom were even closer. He would be in his little twin bed napping in just boxer briefs and she would come up in her nightie and spoon him. She would stroke his chest, thighs, back, and arms. He would pull up her shirt to stroke her belly and would rub her body as well. They would nap like this fairly often. He would constantly tell her how much more beautiful she was than any girl his own age (which would actually be quite sweet if he wasn't rubbing his mostly naked body against her while he said it). The amount of caressing between the mom and her sons kind of reminded me of the Friends episode where Monica was dating the guy who lived with his sister. I couldn't even imagine what it would be like if there was a sister involved. OOF. But everyone in his family seemed totally unfazed by it and the dad seemed to provide plenty of kisses and hugs to his wife and it didn't look like she was lacking intimacy in her own relationship. I also want to reiterate that I DO NOT think that this is a sexual thing (hopefully) between this family. It just doesn't seem like they ever updated their personal boundaries. Like if the her kids were 4 years old instead of 30 this probably wouldn't look as weird...right?

The brother also seemed to want me to touch him as well. I tried to keep it friendly with nothing more than maybe an occasional back scratch or happy pat but you could tell that's not what he was expecting. I asked my BF if he was OK with his brother wanting to touch me more intimately and he said it didn't bother him (I still maintained personal boundaries). When we first started dating, BF and I were having issues because he seemed to have very few physical boundaries with other women and when I would get upset he would say that he was just showing affection and that it was just his love language. He would point out that he touches his male friends too and he has to touch people for work (PT). But I would remind him that he is a good looking man and that when you touch women in certain ways it may: a) come off as creepy or b) send a message that you are interested. He has been uninvited to some events due to past interactions. It took him a while to recognize that not all people want to be touched and he has since lessened his physical interaction with women. Obligatory: He is a fantastic man, I don't plan on dumping him, this wasn't a deal breaker because he is open to communication and change, and we love each other very much.

I know that normal is subjective. That normal is just the standard that you are used to. Maybe this is totally acceptable family interaction and it's just not how I was raised. Though if it was reversed, and I was laying in bed wearing a bikini and my father came up and spooned me in his underwear and we were touching each others bodies...actually can't finish that sentence since it makes me dry-heave a bit....anyways, seems like that situation would be frowned on in most of the U.S. My BF was also raised in a super Mormon (family is no longer practicing) community and I have no idea if that has anything to do with it. Probably not. Just providing more context. I just know that he and all his lady friends growing up would be super touchy with each other because sex was off the table and it was the only way to deal with the tension. IDK, maybe he never learned this stuff. Maybe I'm the weird one for thinking that this is weird. Most of me feels like I should just keep my mouth shut because he has two parents and a brother that love him to the moon and back. On the other hand, if he was raised in an environment where what would be typically be considered sexual touching was used as non-sexual affection, it makes sense that he has been struggling with physical boundaries now that he lives away from his community. The knowledge may help him moving forward though i'm not sure how you can bring this topic up delicately. 

TLDR: Mom spoons and caresses her adult son's. Seems like that type of cuddling is a bit much. What to do? "
"My roommate [26F] has presented me [19F] with a list of things she believes I have stolen from her... I haven't taken anything and everything on the list is basically worthless


I met my roommate, let's say Devin, off of Craigslist 5 months ago. She had cheap rent in a very convenient location near my campus in a nice house. I met her and we hit it off right away. She lived there by herself with just her cats, works nights as an RN at the local hospital and sleeps all day, so it's like I have the place to myself. Also, I really liked that she was single so I didn't have to deal with any relationship drama. It seemed like the perfect set-up and it has been until really recently.

Devin has been acting distant towards me, I've noticed, the past couple of weeks. We were never best friends, or anything like that, but we would watch movies, and go out on little outings semi regularly, which I always enjoyed. When I wake up, it's usually after Devin has already come home and gone to bed, but this morning she was sitting up, like she was waiting for me and she gave me an itemized list, front and back, of things she thinks I stole from her and wants me to return immediately.

It took me a moment to process, I had literally just woken up, not even had coffee yet! I scanned the list and not one thing on it was of any value to anyone but Devin herself. Some choice items from her list:

* 2 ceramic Japanese good luck cat figurines

* 1 paper book copy of Lord of the Flies

* 1 large bison stuffed animal

* 1 navy blue Hollister polo

* coffee mug with brain diagram on it with broken handle

* 1 pair of Marvel Vans size 8 and a half (too big for my feet and I've seen these shoes, they're beat to hell, why would anyone steal them?!)

* 1 picture of my dead friend Robert (w...t...f)

* 1 Marilyn Monroe cigarette lighter

And more random books, articles of clothing and it just goes on like that for two pages! Again, all of this stuff aside from whatever sentimental value Devin has attached to it is completely worthless. She is asleep right now, or at least I think she is. Regardless, she's in her room. How do I even begin to handle this situation?

TLDR Roommate is accusing me of stealing random things of little to no value, which goes without saying that I didn't do it. I kind of need this place to work out, what's the best way to smooth things over?"
"I [44M] am about to take my first vacation (of longer than two days) in fifteen years, and plan to take at least a few days to relax. Am I right to feel that my wife [47F] is being unreasonable in writing a ""schedule"" of chores that I need to accomplish, giving me ZERO days to just relax?


  
  Hello Reddit,   
  

I am a physicist who works in a university research laboratory. I've worked at the same university since I was 27 years old, when I earned my doctoral degree. I am usually gone from the home from six in the morning until about seven o'clock at night.   


  Aside from weekends and the month I took off for my honeymoon when I got married at twenty-nine, I haven't had a vacation since. My research is such that there really isn't much time to be taking vacations.   
 

 My wife is a homemaker and we do not have children (wife is infertile). Instead, our ""kids"" are two dogs (a husky, and a golden retriever), and one cat. Since it's just my wife and me, we have an apartment near the university. I live close enough to the university so that my wife meets me for lunch on most days.   


  My wife's activities include taking extension classes at the university, gardening, attending a sewing circle with her friends, a book club, etc.   


  Our weekends are usually filled with cultural activities such as attending concerts or art gallery openings.   


  My wife and I have a very good relationship and do not really argue about things.   


  Our lab just received a large grant from the state which does not kick in for a couple of months, but in the meantime since I'm redundant my school told me that they can put me on ""half time"" while we wait for the funding in October. Half time means that I am guaranteed a return to full pay in a couple of months, but in the meantime I am placed on half-pay and am not qualified to apply for unemployment.   


  So, the half pay sucks, but hey! More than two months to relax. It came as a surprise, and my wife was ecstatic.   


  I don't make a huge salary, never did, and now that I will be on half pay, we have to be careful with spending. My wife is understanding about this, and doesn't expect us to take some huge vacation or go on a second honeymoon.   


  I came home recently with a list of ideas I thought I might go over with her about how we can spend my vacation. Literally 90% of it involves spending time with her and doing couples stuff.   


  The remaining 10% involves me getting some sleep.   


  I am exhausted all the time, and often feel like I'm going to burn out. I'd like to take three or four days, maybe even a whole week just to sit at home and vegetate for the first time in I don't know how long. It doesn't mean I'm not going to help my wife with stuff, like go with her walking the dogs, or help her vacuum. I just mean I don't really want to go out and go anywhere.   


  But when I got home with my ideas, my wife, to my surprise, presented me with her own itinerary, which involved me doing pretty much all the chores she usually does while I'm at the lab. She wrote down a plan wherein I'm basically doing all the cooking and cleaning and dog walking and laundry from the very first day of my vacation. Granted, there is not a lot of laundry to do for two people, we do not make a mess, so there is not much to vacuum, and it is easy to walk our dogs, but it left a negative feeling in me because these facts tell me that I have broken my back for years giving my wife a pretty comfortable life, and now she is telling me she needs a vacation from doing even these chores?   


  When I come home from the lab I feel literally like I am going to faint, my feet and eyes hurt so much. I'm  only 44 but feel much older. The entire day is stress, looking into microscopes, looking at slides, reviewing peers' work, meetings, it just doesn't end.   


  I ask her what she plans to do while I am doing these chores at home, and she says, ""this is my vacation too!"" And that she needs a break. I ask her what she means by that. She says that she will just spend longer with her girlfriends sewing. When I presented her with my own ideas she said she liked the idea of spending time with me, but that I needed to ""help out"" more at home.   


  I'm not one to start fights with my wife, but should I just suck it up and do the chores? They're not that hard. I can do literally all the stuff she is talking about in about an hour a day. I know this, because throughout the years, on rare days when I am ill (and should be recovering at home) she shoves a mop in my hands and tells me I need to help her out at home. So, even with the flu, I do all her work easily.   


  And still, I feel disrespected because I think she believes I'm just hanging out at work drinking coffee or something. It is redline level stress and it's killing me. I told her on more than one occasion that I am burning out but she just says I'm being dramatic. Personal guests are never allowed in the laboratory, and I feel like my wife believes I'm some old, tenured professor who just stands at a lectern and wastes students' time by spewing personal opinions at them and has a cushy academic life.

No way.  


  She does not lack adult interaction or is prevented from pursuing her interests in her role as homemaker, we don't have human children to raise, so I don't get why she thinks her job is so hard that I need to take over instantly on the very first day I get a break for the first time in fifteen years.   


  Is this an argument worth having? Or am I making a mountain of a molehill?

"How do I ask my girlfriend [31f] to chill when it comes to texting me [28m] at work?


Hi Reddit :)


This is an issue that has been bothering me for a really long time. Sometimes it gets better, but sometimes I'm ready to rip all the hair out of my head.


My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years and living together for 2 years. So, we see each other in the morning before work, when we get home after work, and text throughout the entire day during work. I have a desk job, so I can text pretty easily on the computer (WhatsApp Web) I hate texting on the phone - the keys are so small, autocorrect, ugh. Because I have a desk job, my girlfriend seems to think that I am available to text all the time. 


She will send me a message and if I don't reply quickly enough (sometimes it's 5 minutes) she'll send a follow up 

?

hello

are you ignoring me

hello?

are you busy today?

?

are you annoyed at me?


Usually when this happens it's because I'm in a meeting, I've gone to the bathroom, I'm talking to a co-worker. Sometimes I have people at my desk looking at my screen because we're working on something together and I don't really want to pull up my texts. Other times, I'm just plain WORKING. But it's gotten to the point that when I see the ""?"" message, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO REPLY ANYMORE.


We are in couples counselling and I brought this issue up. My gf had this idea that I only did it when we were having an argument and I am ignoring her, but she does this I would say...every other day. The therapist basically told her to tone it down, and that if I'm at work her first assumption should be that I'm working and not to expect any texts. She did tone it down for about 2 weeks? And during that time she would say stuff like ""Look, I didn't ask you where you were!"". Uh.. congratulations?


I also want to note that this doesn't just happen when I'm at work. there was a time that I was home cooking dinner and she was out shopping or something. She sent me a text but since I was cooking, I didn't see it right away. She got upset that I didn't reply because she thought I was ""secretly Skyping someone"".


A few weeks ago after she sent me another one of her ""?"" after 15 minutes of no reply, I said to her ""Sending me question marks is not going to make me read your texts any quicker"". She told me to stop being a bitch.



TL;DR: Girlfriend expects me to reply to her texts instantly and will send follow up messages until I reply which annoys me so fucking much. "
"My (19F) roomate (23F) continuously watches the security cameras and other controlling behavior.


It's been a month into a twelve month lease and I already feel like moving out. I moved in the first of June and she is at her hometown about an hour away. So we haven't even lived together yet. However we've been having problems nearly every week. The smaller problems include:she is a major nest freak (alternates silverware heads, straightens trash liner, doesn't want a dirty dish laying out, etc) she is very frugal (she asked me to not turn on more than one light at a time in the house and keep the ac at 78) and that she hadn't lived here yet so I've just been guessing at what she wants for the house. 

The biggest problem is the security cameras. She has two security cameras on the front and back door from arlo and she watches them nearly every day. I don't have access to these but I believe she has it to where she gets a push notification every time there's motion. So everytime I leave she gets a notification and can watch the footage of me leaving. 

I had two friends over for a game night and they brought their PC's. We stayed up late at night and then the next day I got a call from her at 6AM  bc she thought someone stole our microwave and TV. I had Chinese food delivered last night. Literally a minute later I got a text asking who that was. I also get texts asking if I could Move certain things in the yard Bc they're in the way of her camera etc. I've told her multiple times to not worry about these cameras and I'll let her know if anything happens but she insists she's ""just checking up on the place."" I feel like she's keeping way too many tabs and some of her requests are unreasonable. It feels less like she's watching the house and more like she's watching me. It's creepy. We haven't even lived together yet and I'm ready to break the lease.

tl;Dr my roomate watches the cameras constantly and I feel it is controlling. She also freaks out over little things such as more than one light being on at a time. I haven't even lived with her yet but I want to move out. "
"Being called selfish for not wanting to do threesomes/orgies


TL;DR My husband calls me selfish and says I don't care about him because I don't want to have threesomes or orgies. I am feeling so confused on what the hell I'm doing.

Am I going crazy? My (32F) husband (34M) called me selfish and said I don't care about him because I didn't want to have sex with a swinger couple last weekend. They wanted to with us and he told them that I was ""way too selfish"" so that wasn't going to happen. He said what he told them to me today.  
We've been married for 11 months, together for 6 years. Honestly, our relationship has always struggled. We had threesomes in the past and they didn't ever really go well because I didn't ever care for them because I was never attracted to the girl enough (or drunk enough maybe) to really get into it. There was only one time I thought it went okay because the girl and I connected more but he says it sucked for him because we weren't paying any attention to him. Not 100% true. I'll admit I have been jealous and insecure in the past, still am insecure because our relationship sucks and has for so long. My husband goes to strip clubs often, always has, and that too created a lot of insecurity earlier on in the relationship that has lingered. He went to a strip club with another girl two nights ago while I was working at home and lied to me about who he was with. Am I causing him to act out like this by being ""selfish"" because I don't want to f\*\*\* other people all the time?? This is coming from a man who gets livid if I speak to/am friendly to another man.

I feel like I'm going crazy and that I can't talk to him about anything. He also has been on a big kick of saying that I have Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Nothing I say convinces him or is good enough. I don't know what to do. I think some of these problems are coming from him also feeling looked over in our relationship and in general. He was the middle child who parents didn't parent. Maybe that's why he's so pissed off that I ""never do anything for him and am incapable of thinking or caring about him"" and that I ""would never do something unless it was something I wanted to do"". WTF."
"I [34/M] feel responsible for everything, while wife [30/F] doesn't pull her weight.


So this one is tough to write, but...it's been building up for awhile now and i've tried to communicate this to my wife but I haven't seen anything change. But basically the jist of it is I am getting overwhelmed with the amount of chores/responsibilities that I end up doing.

First and foremost, we've been married for 6 years and honestly besides this issue everything is ""mostly"" good. We've had our fights in the past but things have improved considerably over the years. That being said I am a very clean person and like our house to be nice and neat (I don't expect perfection obviously, and I know things can't be 100% clean ALL the time) but I hate ""clutter"" especially when it can be easily thrown away.

So first of all let me go through my responsibilities:

1. Mowing/Lawn Maintenance
2. Trash (Taking it out, bringing up garbage cans weekly)
3. Dishes (My wife has a super sensitive smell, so the dirty dishes will literally make her gag. I don't mind doing them HOWEVER when I empty the dishwasher and she puts it in the sink it literally drives me nuts)
4. Picking up the constant clutter that gets left everywhere (Wrappers/Drink Cups/etc...)
5. Vacuuming (My wife does vacuum occasionally, maybe once every couple of months)
6. Paying all Bills
7. Feeding the Cats (Also cleaning out their automatic water fountain which gets nasty every couple of weeks)
8. Any Other General Maintenance with the house
9. Cooking (Although Im ""generally"" home earlier so this one makes more sense, it would be nice to have a break though)

One thing we both do for ourselves is our own laundry, I was originally doing laundry most of the time but got tired of doing hers, folding it, only for it to be left on the floor. So we each do our own laundry.

So as you can see, it's HORRIBLY unbalanced. Used to I could point out that I needed help and she would help but then just go back to her old ways. I would be a LOT less upset if after I clean the house that she would at least ATTEMPT to maintain it. For instance I just cleaned upstairs (Our main ""Living room"" area) which had random papers and such all over the place. Literally next day I see 2 leftover candy wrapped, more misc. papers, and a leftover soda bottle just laying on the floor (Empty) after she had gone to sleep.

I feel like im about to lose my mind. The bigger kicker is now that she's pregnant (around 1.5 months pregnant now) things have gotten even worse. Now I understand pregnancy = you are very tired. I get that...but now if I even bring anything up it's ""IM pregnant Im sooo tired"" basically guilting me in asking for help. So....It worries me that this is how it's going to be with a kid. 

Wtf do I do? I mean I understand being pregnant makes you tired...but I mean does that completely remove any responsibility? Also keep in mind this has been going on WAYYYY before she was pregnant.

FWIW we both work 40 hour per week jobs (She works retail, I work at a Software Company)

tl,dr: Bitter about doing all the housework, wife barely chips in."
"We [M/F both 33] are making no financial progress due to my husband's spending on his hobby, married 3 years


Husband and I began dating 6 years ago. Our marriage was 3 years ago after he finished school (I have a Bachelor's degree and he has a Master's.)

For the past three years since marriage I've worked at two jobs combining to roughly 40 hours/week. Some of our savings are from my earnings, and some are from his parents' inheritance. Our goal is to buy a small house. The city we live in is relatively inexpensive, but a down payment on a house of course still requires saving. 

This has become extremely hard for us to do because of my husband's spending habits. He's very good with money, except when it comes to his hobby, then it's like he just spends with no care. He's had a collection of cat figurines since we met, for years has been growing this collection and adding even more rare or expensive items. He has purchased genuine ceramic artifacts that could be in museums. He finds them on ebay, historical associations, all kinds of places. Sometimes they're being auctioned and he explodes in early on with an offer of thousands of dollars right off the bat to secure his win. At this point he has so many cat figurines there's not even enough space to display them all so a lot just sit in boxes. The spare room he uses as an office has boxes of ceramic cats, china cats, jade cats, crystal cats, every material of cat you can imagine stacked from floor to ceiling against one of the walls.

I've tried in the past to talk to him about my concern with this but I always ended up feeling like a controlling wife. Especially because like I said some of our savings is what he inherited. Technically that is his money.

Well recently (past few months) he's been focused exclusively on buying authentic ones from ancient cultures. As you can imagine those prices are very high. I finally reached my breaking point after he purchased a ceramic cat-shaped Moche drinking vessel for ten thousand bucks. I had to tell him point blank today that at this rate we will never be able to afford the house. He's chewing through his inheritance.

The more I think about it the more angry I get that my salary is effectively going either to something just for him, or to replace what he spends on something just for him. We agreed years back that the point of combining finances is because the things we pay for will benefit both of us. 

Now I feel like I've almost been played. This is not what I agreed to. I'm working for our standard living expenses, the house, and joint indulgences now and then. I am not the cash cow for funding his hobby. 

I told this to my husband. I laid it all out and he responded by telling me that I never said the shared savings were ""only for food, bills, and the house."" That I should have told him ""my rules"" for how he spends his money. I told him this is why I've bitten my tongue, because he acts like I have demanded he give up his hobby, or allow me to monitor his spending. I said very clearly I'm not asking for that, just for recognition that he's spending excessively. I asked if he actually wants to own our own home still? He said yes, but does not see that his spending habits are the reason we're not getting any closer.

This is really frustrating, I'm about to tear my hair out. What do I do to get through to him? I feel like we're on separate teams and he doesn't understand that reaching a joint goal takes effort on BOTH sides. It shouldn't be hard not to blow four to five-figure amounts on items for a hobby if he wants the house.

--------------- 

Tl;dr: Today, I confronted my husband over the fact that despite me working two jobs to support us for the last three years, we're nowhere near our goal of buying a house. He actually had the brass balls to defend pissing my money down the drain on his ceramic cat collection."
"UPDATE: I (25F) am jealous of my husband's (25M) coworker (20sF)


OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91sg4o/i_25f_am_jealous_of_my_husbands_25m_coworker_20sf/

I got a lot of ideas on my original post. Before doing anything, I decided to talk to my husband and tell him how I felt. As soon as I said 'hey, can I talk to you about Kayla?' he seemed to understand. I told him that I was uncomfortable having her over and I was uncomfortable with him essentially asking me to dress like her.

He confessed that he was attracted to Kayla. I pretty much already knew that but hearing it confirmed just sort of broke my heart. He told me he'd stop spending time with her outside of work. I didn't ask him to do that, but he said it seemed like the right thing to do.

Now, since Kayla is part of a larger friend group, my husband has just sort of stopped hanging out with the group. He's puttering around the house playing video games alone, and just seems sad and lonely. I feel really guilty about this. He wasn't cheating on me, he didn't deserve to lose all his friends.

I don't really know what to do now. I'd love further advice from you all as to where to go from here, as far as my husband's friendships, and our relationship. It still feels so raw that he was attracted to someone that looks like the complete opposite of me: body type, skin color, personal style, etc. I want him to be happy, but I want me to be happy too. What should I do?

**tl;dr Husband confessed attraction to coworker. Stopped spending time with her and the rest of his friends, since they're all one group. Now seems sad and alone at home, and I feel guilty.**"
"My [F30] MIL [F65] has a habit of downplaying everyone's intelligence and exaggerating her 'knowledge' and her daughters' [F40] accomplishments. This is somehow a part of every conversation with her. How do I deal with her on her upcoming visit?


My MIL, has a habit to downplay peoples intelligence or minor victories. Eg. Once someone was telling her that the weather suddenly changed and she was not dressed for the cold weather so she was really uncomfortable in the cold weather while getting to school. **MIL**: you should always dress warm for cold weather. Ofcourse this person knew how to dress  but my MIL could not hold off on her advices. She does this every chance she gets and in future will tell this story as ""I saw ..dressed inappropriately for the weather and I had to remind her to dress warm"". Her stories tend to focus on her being the know it all. 

Sometimes when people are super happy and tell her their minor victories, her response won't be appreciative but instead, ""ohh this is nothing. This one time i did even better than this."" This leaves the person so disheartened. I just never enjoy talking to her.

I once told her ""my friend researched on .. for her PhD and was successful"". **MIL**: ""really? Isn't this common knowledge? Why did she have to research it if this is already common knowledge? I already knew it"". I eye rolled so hard, saw my brain that day.

Wouldn't shut up on baby advices since she has 3 kids and 2 grandbabies so is a know it all! This part angers me a lot.

Some back story on her daughter: out of the three siblings, the daughter is least accomplished and people have not been kind in pointing it out to my MIL. So now she (MIL) has been exaggerating her daughters' accomplishments to the point that it becomes uncomfortable to hold the conversation cause of all her (MIL'S) lies. 

Eg. 1. SIL works in a doctors office. MIL: my daughter has been so diligent in her work that they made her doctor. Me: Eyeroll. That not how you become doctors.
2. My daughter is so good at verbal conversations that she can be the best lawyer. She actually did run a few cases and won! Me: Seriously, thats just bullshit. (BUT never said that out loud)
3. MIL: my daughter once got an job at a multinational company that she didnt even apply for, even without the interview. I didnt want her to leave our hometown or she would have an amazing career today. .

..maybe my SIL did get it, maybe shes super talented and gifted, but this came at the wrong time when I was having a hard time finding a job.

MIL has been very bossy and has FIL under the tip of her finger. He's her errand boy and a  yes-mam guy. Theres no hope with FIL to tell her to be rational. They are visiting us soon on a 6 mo trip to help us with our baby. 

How do I deal with her when she starts talking about her and her daughters great accomplishments or feeds us unnecessary knowledge that we all know? I can only eye roll so many times a day. Please help

**TL;DR:** MIL likes to be the hero in all the stories. To accomplish this, she will make you sound dumb, give you unnecessary advices, impart knowledge you already know of or exaggerate her or her daughters achievements. She's going to stay with us for 6 mo and I need help dealing with her."
"Dad [64 M] Wants to come back into mine and my husbands [30 F&amp;M] lives after cutting us off.


Hi I'm writing this post on behalf of me and my husband. I've been dating my husband Jimmy since we were Sophomores in college. After graduation my Dad started making a bunch of off brand comments asking when ""My fling was going to end"" ""There are more important things than looks and muscles"" . It escalated and my dad eventually revealed himself to be a huge racist that thought my Jimmy wasn't good enough for me because he was mixed and had to play football to go to college. My father and I's relationship ended after he told me my grandpa would be heartbroken, he was writing me out of the family trust and that I'd come crawling back to him. My mom agreed with him also, although she was more quiet about it, so I haven't spoken to either of them in 8 years.

My dad is a racist and he's a liar. My grandpa never cared about Jimmy's race and actually knew Jimmy because My Grandpa is a major donor to our alma mater's athletic program and he also informed me my dad was lying about the trust because my grandpa has control of it.  My grandpa and grandma both cut my dad off as a result. They rarely speak.  My grandparents don't invite them to holidays but always invite us, and 2/3 siblings have also taken our side. 

We didn't invite them at our wedding. We ignore their gifts and they've never met either of our two kids. They've tried to apologize, reach out, set up meetings over the years, but both Jimmy and I have been against it. They've referred Clients to Jimmy's training companies, sent hand written letters, but I personally was/am so angry at my dad and my mom for taking his side. 

Recently, my Grandma got sick and almost died, so they came to the hospital when we were there. The focus was on my grandma and we still didn't talk. My dad tried to ask Jimmy to talk while were walking out and Jimmy said no. 

However, a couple of nights ago Jimmy came to me and asked if we were doing the right thing. He said at times he felt like we were, but that he hated having a divided family because he was in foster care growing up. He told me that a lot of his dad's reservations still bother him though. And in Jimmy's defense, they still bother me too. My husband is loving, caring, and a great dad. He turned his collegiate football career into a highly successful training company and he does a bunch of charity work for inner city schools, gives free sessions to poor kids, and goes out of his way to buy equipment/cleats for teens that can't afford it. It actually makes my stomach hurt to think that my father could think lower of him just because he's black.

Jimmy told me he wanted to at least here my dad out because our kids are now getting older (3 &amp; 4) and that he's willing to give him an opportunity to at least apologize and try to move forward if my parents are willing to sincerely atone for their past actions and words. He said my grandma's health scare really impacted him because my grandparents haven't talked to their son much in 8 years and that after this long he thinks my parents might've changed. I'm still a little uncomfortable, but my feeling is that, in this case, my husbands' feelings take precedent over mine because its racially based and he's black. 

We both know it would take a lot of time to rebuild it, if it could ever be rebuilt, but we thought we could meet them, and if there apology/attitude was sufficient at the meeting and then for a period after the meeting then we could introduce them to their grand kids and start rebuilding the relationship. Does this sound ok?

TL;DR Parents were racist assholes and cut me/my husband off. It's been 8 years, and a family tragedy has caused my husband to reevaluate our relationship with them and we want to know if meeting with them, to at least here their apologies and try to take the first step to rebuilding the relationship would work. My husband is the one who brought this idea up."
"My(23M) GF(24F) doesn’t feel confortable with my friend(23F) and wants me to cut off contact with her. I don’t think this is fair.


Sorry for the format guys, I’m on the phone!

I’ll be Me
Gf will be G
Friend will be F

I’ve been dating my gf for two years now and she’s great. She’s super smart, we share a lot of interests and until now I never took her for the jealous type.

I grew up with F, we live in the same street and our mothers are friends. Besides that, after my grandma came to live with us(my grandpa died), they became really close. They’re very much alike and the whole family thinks she’s great. Honestly, she’s considered part of the family. My brothers/cousins/parents all buy her christmas/burthday presents, she spends a lot of holidays on out house and she helps my parents if they need anything since I now live out of the state.

I took my gf to meet them and was very excited. The introductions seemed to go okay, my gf got along with my dad and was already sharing recipes with granny. Later that night we went out to hang out with some friends, F and some of my brothers. They seemed to like each other and my gf laughed a lot(F is hilarious).

On the next couple of days F came to my house a lot of times, which is very normal to us. She has dinner at least once a week there and she and my grandma take salsa dancing classes together(I find it kinda cute). My brothers treat her like a little sister and my grandma called her a ‘time lost twin’

After about 3 days my gf pulled me aside and said she felt very unconfortable with F relationship with my family. She said that it looked like we were married by the way they treated her. I tried telling her that everyone her like a cousin or something but she wasn’t buying. She kept telling me that it wasn’t appropriate for a strange women to be so close to a family and that everyone looks like they’d rather see me dating her. She asked me to distance myself and talk with her about the whole family involvement thing.

I find this very weird... F is like a sister to me and the rest of my family. She literally talked me out of suicide once, she’s not doing anything wrong. She’s not romantically interested on me and she’s great with my grandma/little brother.

I can’t cut her out bc I honestly don’t think she’s doing anything wrong and so doesn’t deserve this treatment, it’s not really just me as she has close ties with my family. Thruth be told, if I did that my brothers/parents/grandparents wouldn’t forgive me and considering they are adults I don’t believe I could prevent them from having contact.

Overall, I feel like everyone would be punished and it’s not really fair.

To make things worse, we had this discussion close to the bathroom my brother was in and he heard everything. My grandma still hasn’t called me over(which she will) but everyone has been colder to her and it shows.

I don’t know how to navigate this situation. How can I put my gf on ease about F and how I can smooth things over with the rest of my family?

TL;DR: my gf doesn’t feel confortable with the close ties my friend has with my family and wants me to cut her off. I feel this is unfair since she did nothing wrong and she’s like a sister to the family

"I [22F] am dating someone [21F] who's a little...strange. Is she just quirky or?


I am dating a woman who I will call Callie. She's great. Sweet, kind, pretty. But she's so bizarre it's almost inarticulable, and I'm wondering whether her weirdness actually falls within the realms of normalcy.

I'll just give you a list of bullet points of her little quirks (of which there appear to be many), and you can decide for yourself

* She doesn't like showers or going in the water (e.g., on a beach). I asked her why and she said that when she showers the water feels like 'too much' and that it was 'too loud'
* Which brings me to my next point. She sometimes complains that things are too loud (even if I don't find them to be) and pretty much refuses to be in a room in which the windows are open because she said she 'doesn't like the noise of outside when she's inside' and that 'outside sounds loud'. Even if it's really hot outside, which it currently is, she doesn't like them open.
* She really, really, really doesn't like scrunched up tissues, wrappers, receipts, etc. When she sees one, she'll sort of shudder and stare at it as if it's the most offensive/repulsive thing in the entire world, and immediately grab it - while holding it away from her body - and put it in the bin. Then she'll rub her hands on her trousers and sort of still look disgusted.
* She's got a small issue with not viewing/hearing about things she finds disgusting/upsetting. The problem is that this can really vary. Once I was making an analogy and said something like ""yeah, it's drier than Gandhi's flip-flop"", and HER FACE. She was absolutely appalled. She sort of looked as though she'd tasted a bad fruit. She told me to never use that analogy again. Jokingly, I asked her why. She said she 'can't get the image out' of her head.
* Which brings me to my next point. When she sees something upsetting or disgusting (a homeless man in the former case, a wrapper shoved into an ashtray in the latter case) she will tell me after the fact that she is still bothered by what she saw and 'can't get the image' out of her head. She told me that she can't stop replaying the image in her head days after the fact.
* Sometimes I'll ask her a question about something and she'll just blank, even if it's something really simple. She'll ask 'what do you mean'? and look at me completely blankly, like she's a computer who's just come up with a 404 error. She told me that a few years back someone at work said 'Callie, you can't understanding anything unless it's explained simply, can you?' From my experience, though, it's a bit more nuanced than that. She finds it difficult to handle non-linear narratives, I think, and prefers a linear narrative as opposed to one that jumps back and forth.
* She does this thing occasionally when I say something she doesn't like or say a word that she doesn't like. She'll shake her head and tap her ear like she's trying to get water out of it and wrinkle her nose. It's pretty cute, if unusual.
* She does this thing that she likes to do with people she's close to (including, but not limited to, me). She encircles my wrist with her thumb and forefinger and makes this clicking noise with her tongue. Then she'll sort of exhale and smile like she's really happy. Sometimes she'll also randomly launch at my face and nibble the tip of my nose.

Sooo...what's up w/ my girl? Lol. I hope I didn't come across as judgy at all in this post. She's just a quirkier girl than I've ever met. It could be nothing. Thanks guys!

TL;DR: Girl I'm dating is great but has a lot of quirks. I'm wondering if they're normal and whether she falls within the realms of normalcy."
"My (29F) BF (28M) Cheated for 2 years after I got pregnant. He doesn't understand why I am humiliated that he told our friends


I'm making this post because he asked me to. Obviously everything about this is messed up, but he specifically thinks I'm ""wrong"" to be humiliated by the fact that the whole time he was doing this some of his friends knew. specifically, friends that had become sort of my friends too, or so I thought. but they kind of egged his bad behavior on and were also cheating on their girlfriends and they would look at porn stars' instagrams together and message them, just to give you a sense. Anyway, after I found out about the cheating he told me his friends knew all along, and I was mad because I had cooked for these guys, hung out with them - they came to my baby's birthday party. I didn't even expect them to tell me I guess, (although they knew he was doing it when I was pregnant and as it turns out he gave me HPV so I wish someone would have thought about what happened if I gave the baby one of the STD's you can pass on via childbirth). I was emotional obviously when I found all this out and sent these 2 guys each a message, very short, just saying ""I thought we were friends and I know you were covering for him for the last 2 years and it hurts that you acted like my friend."" He thinks the worst part of this was the messages I sent them and literally asked me to make a post about it because he is so confident that I'm crazy to be hurt by the fact that other people knew he was cheating on me. It hurts for a lot of reasons, but primarily because it feels like everyone knew he didn't want to sleep with me, and in my mind they're thinking probably because of how my body looked during or after pregnancy, so its just like a giant sign to the people he told that I looked bad naked. and also, just in general, a shitty thing for other people to know about (a shitty thing to happen regardless of who knows)

TLDR: BF cheated on me 2+years. Says I'm wrong to be humiliated that our mutual friends knew. please tell me I'm not crazy"
"I (39f) think I need to let my husband (42m) be with his ex-wife (38f) and daughter (17f)


This is not a typical situation and I'm aware it's probably over Reddit's pay grade. I guess I'm looking for permission/validation/criticism wherever I can get it. Details have obviously been very much fudged to prevent doxing.

15 years ago, my husband's wife, Camille, dropped off the face of the earth. The worst was assumed and David was still grief stricken when we met four years later. Our relationship was an understandably (in my eyes, anyway - my mother says I was too patient) slow, cautious process, and probably would have been an even slower one if his daughter, Eva, hadn't taken to me. I love her like she was my own, though both David and I have made an effort to keep her mother's memory alive for her.

We have been married for seven years. David is a sweet, attentive husband, and we have had a full life. I know he loves me, but I have also always known and accepted that I am not his first choice. I've seen photos and videos of him interacting with Camille. I know how his eyes lit up with her. That is not what we have. That's been OK with me, because even if I wasn't the love of his life, I've always felt that he's the life of mine.

I really want to stress that David has never made me FEEL like I'm inferior to Camille. He has always been open and communicative and struck a textbook delicate balance between acknowledging what Camille meant to him while not downplaying how he feels about me. There isn't much to complain about when it comes to David. I think that makes this worse.

Two years ago, Camille reappeared. She was not gone willingly and what she went through was very traumatic. It took her months to be ready to see David and a few more to see Eva, and I met her with David in-between. She's an incredibly strong woman and has made such amazing progress in the time since. I expected her to resent me, as someone who sort of stole her life. Instead, she has thanked me for being in David and Eva's life and said they've been lucky to have me. She was always worried they would be sad and apparently credits me that they're not.

But...they are sad. Or David is, at least. Eva has adjusted and bonded with Camille - all three of us have bonded, really. I genuinely like Camille and don't think I could have shown the grace that she has in this situation.

David has become the fourth wheel. He makes an awkward effort not to be alone with Camille, or to have private conversations with her. If we're all out together, he'll sit as far from her as possible, or walk as far from her as possible. Camille will try to have a casual conversation with him and it's like he's a twelve year old who has never had a conversation with a girl. I see how he looks at her, though, when he doesn't think anyone will notice. It's the same look he has in all those photos and videos. I've heard him sobbing more than once.

Our marriage has not suffered. If anything, I'm paid more attention to than before - and I wasn't lacking before. We've been in counseling throughout all this, but he shuts down when it comes to how he feels about Camille now. In his roundabout way, he's copped to still loving her. I've heard through a friend of Camille's that she's still in love with him, though Camille herself is too respectful to let me in on that.

Everyone is too fucking polite.

Though Camille has said she's far from being ready to date, she has gotten closer to an old high school friend over the last few months. Whenever David sees them together, he looks like he simultaneously wants to burst into tears and punch the guy.

I got to this point and know I don't know what this long post is asking advice for.

How to set up your husband with his ex-wife? How to extradite yourself from a family you love but isn't yours?

I love David. I love Eva. I kind of even love Camille, this beautiful, kind woman who didn't deserve to lose everything.

I don't feel neglected. I'm not unhappy. Maybe Camille and David would spend an hour in a room together, alone, and realize they have nothing in common anymore.

I don't know, and I don't know if I can't know that.

**TL;DR: I think I'm the person standing between my husband and the woman he loves. How do I step aside?**"
"Update: My [16F] boyfriend [16M] of two years called me a 'useless bimbo'


[removed]"
"My grandparents [98M and 89F] are livid that I've told them I [26F] am quitting my job. How do I repair our relationship and get them to understand?


Some backstory on my job: I've been working there for a little over three years now. I got hired straight out of college and I've been working there ever since. In that time, I haven't received a single raise or a promotion. Instead, my coworkers, who never went to college and started after me, with the same job, have received an average raise of $10K since they've started (our position explicitly demands a college degree, but they somehow get around it). They all now make more than me, and openly discuss how ""poor"" they are, which frustrates me and makes me resentful. I've also been promised a promotion three times to officially get the title I've been doing for the past two years, but then I find out it's ""not in the budget"" every time. For the past two years, I had been acting as an editor, and I kept getting told to keep being an editor so they can have ammo to support me officially getting the promotion, but it never materialized.

In January, they switched me to a new assignment. I got switched from being a reporter and a de facto editor to a ""writer."" I was told it would be temporary. When I asked to make the salary the former employee made, I was told absolutely not. When I asked if I could go back to my old job when they officially hire a new person to replace her, which I actually enjoyed, I was told absolutely not. I'm basically spending my days doing tech support for old people who don't know anything and this is a whole fat piece of ""I was never originally hired to do this."" I was told that if I didn't stay at this new position, and tried to leave and go elsewhere, I would be blacklisted from ever finding a job again.

My new boss and I do not get along. He makes comments about my religion (I am the only non-Catholic in the office), he inquires a lot about my sick days, and I honestly just don't agree with the mission of this new department at all and it feels like it's my job to stop him from embarrassing himself and our entire organization.

Over the past month, he's put me on ""probation"" for disagreeing with him too often. He also gave me a ""strike"" for refusing to stay later, past 6:30, to work on something when I had a previous commitment (I work 8 AM-5:30 PM, no lunch break). He also keeps accusing me of being a plant in the organization to try to bring it down because I disagree with him.

On Friday, I snapped, since I found out an intern just got hired for the very exact job I said I wanted, at a starting salary much higher than my own. They created this job out of nowhere and gave it to him despite it being the job I had always said I wanted to go back to, but they told me it didn't exist for me.

I was so fed up on Friday, after arguing with my boss all day about an assignment, that I asked to just go home at 4 PM and take the day as a sick day. He flipped out and, after I left work, made someone stop by my house to make sure I was ""okay."" I live over 2 hours from work.

Onto my grandparents: My grandparents have known that I've wanted to leave my job for a very long time now. In fact, when I was visited them last month, I had to cut my trip short to rush home for a job interview I got last minute. When I told them about the interview, my grandfather said, ""Don't leave your job until you have a new one."" I did get that job offer, but it didn't work logistically for me, fwiw. I've been interviewing the past few weeks with a new position, but it requires me to take vacation days randomly that get me in trouble (especially on probation), and I think my time would be better spent home, applying for jobs, then working at this job that makes me miserable. When I told my grandmother I plan to leave, she said no, give it more time, and stick it out. I told her I spent six months in this new position and it isn't for me. She said to just give it more time, years even, and never to leave a job before I have a new one. She told me if I leave I might never get a job again for as long as I live, and I should be grateful I have a paycheck at all. I got really annoyed and told her I had to get off the phone, but she was screaming at me for even thinking of leaving a company ""after everything they've done for you."" Apparently, denying my days off for religious holidays, denying me raises and promotions, and threatening my employment are all great things they've done for me.

I know it's probably a generational thing to not want to leave a job until you find a new one, and to stay at one company for your entire life, but I really resent my entire position here. My grandfather used to clean bathrooms before he got promoted to working his actual job… But things aren't really like that anymore. People are coming in and getting hired at positions above me, despite how long I've been there, and it's not the same kind of environment nor job market that they were faced with. I'm upset I got so upset I had to abruptly hang up on my grandmother, but how do I make them understand why I need to leave?

TL;DR My job is horrible. I get passed over for promotions and raises and I got demoted, put on probation, and threatened with ""strikes"" whenever I try to clarify anything to my boss so we don't seem like blubbering idiots. My grandparents believe that you should never leave a job until you have a new one, and do not support me in leaving, no matter how terrible it is. How do I explain to them the situation is just unbearable?"
"I [22 F] got him [30? M] un-invited from college parties, for being a creep to freshmen. I just found out he's a superior to me, at my new job.



When I was in college, I was in an academic club. We'd often have house parties, at various club members houses. I started when I was a sophomore, and I noticed there was this guy Josh who was way older than anyone else at a lot of the parties, who would go and hit on the youngest girls. (I'd say he was about 10 years older than these girls) Apparently he was an alumni of the club, and I assumed he was close with the club leadership, so I figured there was nothing to be done.

He never flirted with me, maybe it was the fact that I'm openly queer, maybe it's the way I've been told I've got a ""take no shit"" attitude. But Josh made a lot of the other girls in the club uncomfortable. I remember one of my friends from the club, a freshman, quit the club after he grabbed her by the neck at a party ""as a joke"" and wouldn't let her go. 

As I got more involved in the club over the years, and got closer to the club leadership and a lot of the members, I started to suspect that other girls in the club were uncomfortable around Josh. It was kinda an open secret that he'd pursue freshman and sophomores hard, but lose interest in anyone older than that. Most of the guys in the club were oblivious to this.

I was having a ""girls night out"" with a bunch of friends from this club, after I'd been involved with it for years and had made some great friends there. I brought up how creepy Josh was. It was the first time I'd spoken about it openly, and it was like the floodgates opened. Every single person there had stories to tell about their own experiences with him, that they'd felt alone in. We all decided that night that when one of us held a party in the future, Josh wouldn't be invited. And if any of the guys in the club threw a party, I volunteered to tell them that many of the women in the club (without naming names) wouldn't be comfortable with Josh being there.

I actually did have to talk to a couple of the guys in the club, asking them not to bring Josh to parties, and they all took it so well. A lot of them said they wished someone had told them before, they didn't want anyone to be harassed at their parties. That was a great surprise, I was worrying they'd defend their friend. 

I didn't see Josh again at a party after that, but I heard through word of mouth that he blamed me for no longer being welcome at parties. I guess that makes sense, since I did kinda act as ""the spokesperson"" for a bunch of the girls who didn't want to be named, when I talked to the club leadership, and some of the guys who'd throw parties. I figured all that was over and done with though...

----

I just got a job at an engineering company, that I was super excited about. And on my first day of work, I found out that Josh works as a system engineer, while I'll be working as a subsystem engineer. So he's not my direct manager, but he does act as a superior to people on my team. When I saw him, I acted polite, but as if I didn't recognize him.

One of my coworkers asked me in the first week whether Josh and I had some kind of beef, because apparently Josh had told a few of his friends at work to be careful what they say around me, because I ""tend to overreact"" and ""snitch"". I gave a very non-committal answer, just responding to her question with a question... ""Wow, do you know why he said that"". My coworker said no.

----

Right now, I'm panicking. I'm worried Josh is going to do something to fuck me over professionally, at this job that I was so excited about. 

I don't know whether I should clue HR in on our past conflict, and his apparent comments at work. Or if that would not be appropriate. I just don't know what's normal to do at a job, this is my first job that's not a summer retail gig.

TLDR - I just started at a job with a guy in his 30s who is apparently angry with me for getting him un-invited from college parties.

"My boss (24M) is dating my ex (19F) and now I (19M) feel so uncomfortable and insecure at work.


My ex and I broke up around four months ago after dating for a little over a year. She was the one who broke up with me but at the time I agreed that it was for the best so we ended things on good terms. We're pretty chill now and we have mutual friends so we often all hang out together. So things between us are chill and friendly. 

I work at a research lab at my university and I just recently landed the position after a pretty damn long (and competitive) application/interviewing process. I met my boss, who's a grad student and we became buddies pretty fast. He's a really nice and funny dude that knows what he's doing. I see him everyday me and some other undergrads work under him and help with his research while he helps use with our own.

Fast forward about two weeks and I see on my ex's snapchat story a fucking picture of my boss with a heart emoji. I'm shocked as fuck so I reply to her story asking her who her new boy is and sure enough she tells me she's dating my boss. I feign happiness for her and I don't tell her that he's my boss or that I know him in any way. But damn, I felt like someone just stabbed me in the heart. I though I didn't have feelings for after our break-up but after seeing her story, I was just hit with a pang of jealousy. Maybe it's because he's a major step-up from me. I'm a poor undergrad with shitty taste in clothes and messy hair and he's a successful, young talent who dresses exceptionally well and looks like he has his shit together.

The next day at work I'm basically on edge the whole day. I would look at my boss, remember that he's dating my ex and just feel so uncomfortable. The rest of the week was like that too. I stopped joking around with him and kind of just stopped talking in general to him. Now I dread seeing him everyday because the fact that he's my boss, so he orders me around, just makes me feel shittier and more ""below"" him. He's got the girl and I've got no one. I still love my job though and I worked so hard to get it so I'm not planning on leaving.

Now I just feel like I should've tried harder in our relationship because damn, she was pretty perfect in every way and I just let is all slip through. The other day, she came over to have lunch with him during his lunch break and I saw them laughing together and yea, another wave of sadness and jealousy. 

What do I even do now. How do I stop feeling like this? How should I normalize the situation at work?

TL;DR: "
"My (26/F) boyfriend (25/M) of a year, sat me down last night and told me that he asked me out a year ago because we were together in a past life, and now I’m really worried about his mental health.


I know the title sounds crazy. 

We went out to dinner after work, and then went back to my place. I noticed that he was uncharacteristically quiet for most of the night so I asked him if everything was okay. He was reluctant to open up at first, but he eventually sat me down and told me that since he was a young boy, he’s had visions of people from the past. Apparently when he was young he didn’t know what it meant or who these people were, he figured they were just dreams. Of the same two people. *Always*. Slowly as he grew older he realized he was one of the people in the visions. There was always a guy and a girl, both of them adults. 

Anyway he eventually realized these were visions of a past life. And when we met for the first (or maybe not the first) time, he recognized me as the girl who was with him in these visions. That was why he asked me out. 

I thought he was joking at first but he said that he was completely serious, and he said he knows how crazy it sounds. Honestly I don’t know what to think and I had no idea what to say to him. I just sort of brushed it off and told him that it wasn’t a big deal to me as long as he was okay and as long as he wanted to be with me, not only because of these visions. He said he loves me and that he just felt as though it was the right time to tell me the one thing he’s been hiding all this time. 

We went to bed and that was pretty much it. 

All day now I’ve been thinking about what he told me. I still don’t know what I’m supposed to make of it. He really is a great guy and I care about him a lot, but this does worry me a little bit. It’s one thing to say he felt connected to me when we met or something, but he’s saying he’s had *visions* of us since he was a child. 

To my knowledge he’s always been fine in terms of his mental health. Maybe I’m overreacting. I don’t know. I had trouble just sleeping in the same bed as him last night. To be fair, that’s mostly because I’ve had a past experience with a guy who got a little too attached to me too soon in our high school relationship, became really delusional, and eventually broke into my house when I was home alone once. It was pretty crazy and I went to therapy because of it for about a year after it happened. 

The two situations aren’t the same of course, but this current one *is* bringing up some of those memories of the old one that I would rather just forget and move past. My boyfriend knows every detail. I can’t imagine a situation in which he would try to hurt me or himself but it’s still a thought in the back of my mind. 

I’m not sure what to do or how to really explain myself to him without hurting him or disrespecting the trust that he’s extended to me in telling me his secret. He’s a great guy. I’m just uncomfortable, I guess. 

It’s only been a year since we met and started dating. We don’t live together. 

I’m sure there’s more about him that I don’t know. 

Does this sound worrying to anyone else? Or am I just overreacting? 

**tl;dr** He’s never struggled with mental health as far as I know. This came as a shock to me. And he could be telling the truth. I’m just a bit worried now. I’ve had experiences with a guy who got too attached and whose delusions eventually pushed him to the point of breaking into my house when I was home alone in high school. Not sure what to make of this current situation. I’m worried about him. Should I just brush it off or does this sound worrying to anyone  else?

"I [f/29] feel that my boyfriend [m/29] has become comfortable in our relationship and doesn't notice me anymore


Me and the bf made plans to go to Crazy Bear hotel just because. I was going to pick him up from his house at 1.30pm... about 1 he said he would drive instead so he'll get me. I said ""still 1.30?"" He says yes 

It gets to 1.30 and he's not at my place I wait a bit and he's still not arrived. It gets to 1.50 and i call him. Goes straight to voicemail. He calls back at 2 and says he'll be 5 minutes.

He eventually arrives at 2.10pm I get in the car and ask casually ""why are you so late?"" He rolls his eyes and says ""come on I'm not that late.""

I was just taken aback by his response. I just think it was really disrespectful to turn up late and not even say sorry! That's just common curtesy, or at least call me to mention I'm running a bit late.

Anyway, we get to the hotel and it's AMAZING. We have dinner reservation at 7.30 and i get dressed, do my hair, wear my really expensive shoes I've never worn before and not once did he compliment me saying I look nice. My hair is usually curly and it was straight it's like he didn't even notice.

I complimented him on his new shirt and he said thanks and that was it. I got a bit tipsy at dinner so it was only the next morning driving back home from the hotel did it really sink in that I felt like there wss no point in me making effort yday at all. We don't really go out that much so to me the dinner was exciting and new.

I dont NEED him to tell me I look good, to know that I looked good. I KNOW I looked amazing yesterday, it just sucks that my boyfriend didn't seem to notice at all.

I've come home and my mind is just spiralling n I'm just thinking maybe he doesn't notice because he genuinely doesn't care anymore.

TL;DR I put in a lot of effort into looking nice for date night and boyfriend didn't even notice. Also didn't say sorry for being late to pick me up... am I overreacting?"
"My [23F] bf [20M] told me that he doesn’t want to have sex with me anymore.


So when we started dating 1.5 years ago, we had a healthy sex life. Everything was really good until I moved in with him last august. We were living with roommates so he was super uncomfortable having sex because he was scared his roommates would hear. But he was fine with everything else but sex.  This was when we kind of stopped having sex at all, he would tease me everyday then just tells me to masturbate to finish myself off because he’s tired. 

This went on for almost a year. Now fast forward to this summer, he told me that he wanted to try  having sex with no condom and asked me to get on the pill. So I got on the pill, then we had sex once. Immediately after sex, he told me that he’s not comfortable having sex with me anymore because of my past. He says that because I’ve had one night stands or drunkenly almost hooked up with some people I shouldn’t have, that it makes him feel like sex is not as meaningful to me compared to how meaningful it is to him. It just confuses me because he knew about my past before we ever started having sex and it’s just so sudden? I don’t get why it wasn’t a problem before but now it is... and all of this is years in the past...

He says if i can keep away from having sex for 3 months, he’ll consider it. However, ever since this he has said this, he constantly wants blowjobs, hand jobs and every sexual thing... except sex.

Im just confused and unsure what he wants as well as im not sure if he’s slut shaming me for my past. What should I do? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I just feel very hurt and confused.

TLDR; bf suddenly wants to stop having sex because of my sexual history even though he’s known about it before we even started dating."
"My husband (30/m) and I (29/f) somehow fell into a marriage rut too quickly


Alright, I do get it... most of the time married couples get into some sort of rut at some point. I understand this. But how does this happen to two young individuals who haven’t even been married that long!

My husband and I have been married for almost a year now. We had dated for quite a few years before that. I just feel like at this point, we are so incredibly comfortable around each other, the allure and sexiness, lust, etc has just vanished.  Maybe it’s my fault, maybe it’s his or both, I don’t know... maybe farting in front of each other or using the bathroom at the same time wasn’t helping. We have seen the best and the absolute worst of eachother.  Did we somehow become roommates/best friends who simply have sex? 

In the beginning couple years of our relationship, the sex was spontaneous, intense, constant! It slowly turned into this, so it wasn’t an instant rut. Now we have sex and while it’s still satisfying for both, that spark and passion isn’t there. We both love eachother deeply and have so much fun together. Where does that fire go though? Can you get it back after you’ve done so much “gross” stuff in front of them? I feel like it’d just be awkward trying to bring out that hardcore lust at this point. That “I’ve got to have you now, I don’t care where we are” feeling. I miss those days! 

Additionally, I have found myself to fantasize about other men I know (friends, colleagues, exes) in a purely sexual way. I’d never want to be in a relationship with them, but picturing having a forbidden sexy one night stand with so much lust and passion is what pervades my mind. 

TL;DR - Husband and I got too comfortable and fell into lustless rut very soon into our marriage"
"I’m [24F] getting married soon. My mother [48F] is extremely hurt that I want to have my wedding away near my fiancé’s family instead of the town I grew up in. Thoughts?


Alright so I just got engaged to the love of my life after dating him for 8 years. About 5 years ago I moved 3 states away from all of my family to be with him, things have been great. I visit my family whenever possible and I see them for all of the major holidays. I’ve always missed them a ton but I’ve also enjoyed moving away from the really small town I grew up in and I love where I live now. Anyways, my fiancé has a huge family here (talking 150+) who want to be at our wedding, while my family is very small (about 25-30 people at the most). We’ve always decided that we’re going to get married closer to his family since I don’t really care which state I get married in and it’s just the more logical thing to do instead of having 150 people travel 14 hours away. 

Recently my mother has expressed that she’s very hurt over our decision to get married closer to his family, because she thinks I’m being unfair and giving my own family the short end of the stick. Keep in mind, about a year ago my brother also got married to someone with a huge family who lived across the country. They ended up having two separate ceremonies with each family, but of course his wife’s side was much bigger since she has so much family. My mom was also hurt by this, and has told me that she doesn’t want me to hurt her like that too. I would rather not have two different ceremonies in different states like my brother did since it’s important to me to have both families at my wedding for everyone to properly meet each other and have a good time. I’m not ruling out the option, but it just wouldn’t be my cup of tea to split the families like that, not to mention the extra costs of paying for two weddings.

Please help, my mother has already shed so many tears because my brother chose to move away from home to be with his wife too and lives closer to her family just like I live closer to my fiancé’s family.

Am I being unfair to my family to make all 25 of them travel 14 hours away for my wedding? Am I catering too much to my fiancé’s family even though they have drastically more people? Do you think I should have two ceremonies like my brother did, even if I don’t necessarily want to? I’m really trying to not start any drama in my family or hurt my mom even more.. I don’t know what the right thing to do here is.

Tl;dr: My mom is upset that I’m having my wedding closer to my fiancé’s family even though they have much, much more people attending from his side. I’m trying to be logical about this while still keeping everyone happy. "
"When is it time to end a marriage? 30M with 28F, married 2.5 years.


My husband and I have been married since early 2016 and together since 2013. He can be incredibly sweet, loving, and fun, but things have gotten incredibly tough in the past few weeks and I’m not sure when enough is enough.

We have had fights periodically but things took a turn for the worst a few weeks ago. We went to a party at the home of one of his coworkers who I’ve been uncomfortable with in the past - she’s always very touchy-feely and giggly with him, stalks his Facebook (she will go on little spurts of liking his posts back from months ago, and I see it because I’m often tagged in them and get the notification), and she’s going on a weekend trip that he and his coworkers have coming up which has made me a bit uncomfortable. 

During the party, we all were a bit drunk and she was running around in her bikini dancing up and bumping into my husband. I was incredibly upset watching this happen and felt so disrespected that he didn’t tell her to stop right then and there. We ended up having a huge fight at the party and I’ve been quite depressed since then. He has gone back and forth between saying that he doesn’t remember to saying that she’s a slut and he remembers and acts like he has talked to her about it. I really don’t know what is the truth.

Fast forward to tonight. I’ve been trying to forget the incident but have still had times where I’m feeling quite down about things, and so I stayed in tonight while he was out with friends. He stopped home to bring me some wine and said that he was going back out to meet a friend at a cafe, and we had a discussion then about my trust issues and he was begging me to trust him. While home, he changed and was very overdressed for the cafe he was talking about going to, and saw me get suspicious so he changed into something else. Meanwhile his phone is getting message after message.

I really, really hate to snoop and don’t want to be a nagging wife, but I noticed that he had left his smart watch behind which syncs his texts and I got curious. Lo and behold, he was texting with his friend about going to a hotel bar rather than the cafe but was insisting the whole time to me that they were going to a cafe. This all happened while he and I were having a conversation about how I’m struggling to trust him after I saw how he handled his coworker making advances in front of me.

So when is it time to just give up? I’m feeling so sad and empty and don’t know what to do. I can’t tolerate being lied to and I just don’t know what is the truth anymore.

TLDR; husband didn’t stop a coworker who was being overly flirtatious in front of me and I’ve had trust issues since. As we were having a discussion tonight about those trust issues, he was lying to me about where he was going tonight. Not sure when to give up on the marriage."
"My husband [35M] and I [33F]currently have credit card debt to pay off, but my husband isn't eager to discuss budgeting and cutting expenses (i.e., changing our lifestyle) because he thinks it is just a temporary cash-flow problem.


I have a salary of $60k per year. My husband's job pays well ($150k-200k per year), but his income is variable. We have a lot in retirement and and home equity, but our cash flow has not been good the past six months. For the first time, we have relied on our credit card to pay household expenses. We're over $20k in credit card debt. It's freaking me out.

I grew up middle class and always watched what I was spending until I merged finances with my husband. My husband came from a wealthy family, and I have slid into his style of not paying attention to our spending as long as we were able to save and cover expenses. This has worked for the five years that we have been married.  I'm starting to put together a list of things to reduce our monthly expenses (which have averaged around $10k, including fixed mortgage, student loan, and daycare totaling $5k), but he refused to discuss the very first item I proposed (our cleaning lady). She's $170 per month (or $2k per year). He said it's a drop in the bucket, and that I'm bad at cleaning. I said I would clean more if we weren't paying for someone else to do it. This is the just the first item on the list. I am shocked at what we have actually been spending on fitness, entertainment, and eating out. 

Emotionally, how should I view our other spending items? I'm more willing to cut items than he is. He thinks its just a matter of cash-flow. Is it worth cutting back while we're in debt right if it's going to cause fights and stress? I'm just new to this, I don't know how to evaluate and propose cutting each item of spending (do we need a full cable package to be happy? Siruis radio? private pilates instructor?). It seems irresponsible to assume that this is a temporary lag in income. How long can this continue on?

Finally, I should mention that I'm only working 32 hours per week so that I can be home with our daughter by 3:30 p.m. four days a week. I could ask my boss to go back to full time and make $75k per year. Maybe I (and our daughter) need to sacrifice, too? Any thoughts, suggestions, or reflections would be appreciated.

tl;dr My husband and I disagree on reducing expenses while we are in debt during a period of low income. "
"Was I [25F] wrong in asking my boyfriend [23M] to not go on his family trip?


My boyfriend is an Air Force reservist and he has a 5-day work engagement next week. He is also going on a family trip this weekend. I offered to pay for the hotel for work ($300) because he waited too long to reserve one that the AF would pay for. A few days later, I suggested that he not go on the vacation and to ask his parents for the money they are going to spend on him there to help him get through the week while he's working. He then proceeded to blow up on me saying that his family only goes on vacations once every 2-3 years, so if he misses this one then he would have to wait, and that I don't care about his being able to spend time with them.

He then said that they are struggling financially, so they would only be able to contribute $50 at most and that it's just a ""drop in a hat"" of a $300 hotel bill. Well, I feel like it's my money I'm dishing out so he has no say in what's going to help me or not. ALSO, he's in the negative so he has no money for gas to get there and back OR food while he's there. Now I'm going to be footing the bill for all of that since he's adamant about going on the trip and not getting his parents to help me out.

He also tried to say things like he would sleep in the car and not eat for the whole week so I wouldn't have to pay for anything. I feel like that was very manipulative as he knows I can't let him do that in good conscience, but I'm starting to think I should now. I also voiced that sentiment of how I couldn't do that, and he called it a ""me"" problem. He isn't being practical at all and is taking this all very personally. Should I still pay for the trip? Was I wrong in suggesting that he not go on his family trip?

[b]TLDR:[/b] I asked my boyfriend to not go on a 2-day family trip and take the money that would've been spent there (by his parents) to help me pay for his work trip. He blew up on me and said I don't care about his family and won't be helping me pay for it."
"I [30] feel as if it is “always something” with my husband [30 M] with “high standards” and I’m exhausted


My husband and I have been together five years, married about two. While I experienced some of this during our relationship I feel as if the past two years when living together (we lived together only briefly before marriage) have been particularly bad. 

I should preface this with the fact that he’s currently not speaking to me, and hasn’t been all day today, so that’s pleasant. 

Basically, let me first say that I take some responsibility. I can be clueless. I have adhd (actually diagnosed, I have medication which helps but I don’t take it every day) and my tolerance for mess and chaos are high— probably pathologically high. It doesn’t bother me. I also sometimes get very distracted or fixated by other things and small things escape my notice. 

My husband: in my armchair psychologist opinion, undiagnosed OCD (refuses therapy of course, so we’ll never know.) Cleanliness and order is of utmost importance... which okay, except the burden of all this seems to have fallen to me for some reason since we got married. 

To summarize, my husband is almost always mad at me, not speaking to me, or angry with me over something. The examples include: 

- We took a trip together and last minute, he decided we would take my car instead of his, and my car was not up to his standard of cleanliness (for me, it was actually decently cleaner than usual)

- I park too far to the right in our driveway, and forgot to park all the way to the left yesterday (that’s part of why he’s not speaking to me today)

- The laundry room (in our basement, which we never go in) is too messy

- I did not make a grooming appointment for our dog the same day her asked me to do so

- I was late getting back from a class and he was expecting me at 10:30, and I arrived at 10:45 without calling him to let him know

- Anytime our dog makes a mess (he says it’s my fault for wanting a dog to begin with)

- He unexpectedly had a friend over and our bed was not made (since I was the last leaving the house, I should have done it? Though we have no agreement about this) 

- I had a day off and when he got home, dinner was not made

I could go on and on. The thing is, they’re all small things in my estimation, but I guess not for him? He often will cite the examples above as “examples of [my] ongoing disrespect to me and lack of consideration for my feelings.” 

For me, I get upset about fairly big things. His comments towards me (sometimes rude, even if in jest), having an attitude, and of course fighting with me over the above. 

I feel so tired and unable to keep up with all the things I’m “supposed” to be doing. But then I also question if it’s me, because I am messy, forgetful, etc. so maybe it really is that I’m just a terrible wife and person to have to live with. 

We tried therapy once but the therapist COMPLETELY agreed with him on all fronts and it would just turn into them both going on about how disrespectful I was (the therapist was also a neat freak and had OCD, self-admitted). I said I wanted to find someone else but my husband refused and said I just didn’t like what I was hearing from our current therapist. 

[TL;DR I feel as though my husband nit picks at me and nothing I do is “good enough”]"
"I [25 F] bought my parents a truck. My boyfriend [30 M] is upset with me over it.


So when I was growing up, my family was pretty poor. But they wanted me to do better for myself in life, so they really pushed me to value education and go to college. I was the first one in my family to go to college. Even with scholarships, they spent a lot on my education, more than they could really afford. It exhausted their emergency fund, and they did without a lot to get me through college.

I literally picked my major because it was number one on the list of top paying careers you can get with a bachelor's degree. I didn't want me or my family to have to worry about money again.

----

I always wanted to be able to pay my parents back for my education, even though I didn't know how I would; they're too proud to let me give them cash. But for the few years I've been out of college, I've been saving up a ""mom and dad"" fund. I've also been looking out for myself, putting a lot into my retirement savings and house savings. 

Last month, my parents pickup truck broke down for good. They live out in the country where having a car or truck is absolutely necessary, and I knew my dad needed a vehicle to get to work.

I went out to a dealership right away on Friday and bought a truck, paid for it in full. I picked one that was reliable and cheap to insure and maintain. Then I took the long drive out to surprise them with it Saturday morning. 

I hadn't had a chance to talk to my boyfriend about the truck before I bought it. He was away on business that week, in an opposite time zone. And while I texted him ""Shit my dad's truck is busted"" right away, he didn't see it until I'd already bought the truck and given it to my parents. I'd been in a big rush to get the truck there before Monday, so my dad would have it for the work week.

-----

My boyfriend texted me back after all that, asking ""what happened?"". I told him ""blown head gasket, but it's ok, I replaced it"" He said ""I didn't know you were a mechanic"" and I said ""No I mean the truck"" 

That whole exchange took a day because we were in basically opposite tine zones. But when I said I replaced the whole truck, he called me immediately, even though it was late for me. 

He basically told me that it was crazy of me to make such a big financial decision without talking to him. 

I told him ""You know that money and more was already set aside for my family, I just hadn't known till now what exactly I'd be needing it for."" 

He said ""You said your parents would never take money from you.""

I said that's why I'd bought a truck instead of giving them cash straight up, because I thought they'd accept a gift but probably wouldn't take a check from me. 

It became pretty obvious that he saw my ""mom and dad fund"" as something I'd not actually spend on my parents; because they'd just refuse to take the money. And it had come as a big surprise that I took 18,000 out of it, and they actually took the truck I bought with it. 

I got pretty upset, saying ""What did you think I was doing saving that money? Just a silly idea, that I'd never go through with?"" 

He just kept going on about how I said once that my parents were too proud to take cash.

----

Since then, he's been passive agressive about me being ""secretive"" and also ""impulsive"" even though I never tried to be any of those things.

And I'm mad it seems like he didn't take it seriously when I said that money was set aside to take care of my parents. 

Should I have talked with my boyfriend about the truck before I bought it? Or is he being disrespectful, not taking me saying I wanted to provide for my family seriously? 

TLDR - I bought my parents a pick up truck, and my boyfriend is mad he didn't hear about it until after I did it.

"My (30F) boyfriend (30M) doesn't like losing at video games


We just went out to a barcade. I used to work in the video game industry, so I am not bad at games. He is a nerd. We played Marvel vs Capcom and while I usually suck at fighting games (MK vs DC being the exclusion) I am actually really good at very certain old school games - my mom dragged me to country western family nights every weekend growing up and I would play arcade games to escape having to dance with old or creepy people.

 So, I have a weird magic button mashing style that does ok - I basically dodge and jump when appropriate and mash buttons a ton for attacks. It's not refined but it works - at the core gameplay, I'm doing the rock/paper/scissors. 

Boyfriend and I played several rounds. I decimated him - all 3 of my heroes were alive at KO. He scoffed and told me to try vs AI. Easy win. We rematched. I win again. He says try harder AI and slams down max level difficulty. Again I win.

This is when we entered the Twilight Zone. He then started making up excuses for his loss - not the same game cabinet he grew up with, joystick sticky, basically a ton of excuses. We leave the bar and go home and I can't just accept this.

To me, this feels a lot like the shit I got daily when I worked in video games. There is disbelief that a woman could do x so he's trying to find reasons to explain why it happened, reasons that don't hurt his ego, reasons which throw me under the bus and invalidate my own skill. I know this is just a video game as the catalyst, but it reveals a worrying mentality. 

We have paused the argument because we recognize we are both drunk, so I'm gathering input before we talk again. I think he is in the wrong, though - we were at a barcade for the purpose of playing games. Beating him should not be controversial.

I would like input - I am open to changing my view.

Tl;Dr: boyfriend got pissy when I beat him in a video game"
"I [30M] have become obsessed with tapes that my girlfriend made for me before she died.


My girlfriend died of cancer last year. She had a lovely voice that used to get me to sleep easily. As a result, before she became unwell she made some recordings that I could listen to if something ever happened to her.

Since she passed, I have become ultra protective of the tapes. I made about a zillion copies of them and am frightened of any of them getting damaged. I listen to them each night. I think I should possibly go to therapy but I am too nervous.

Realised I forgot to ask for advice on the other question! Does anyone have any suggestions regarding on-going grief counselling and such? Or any ideas on how to remember someone but also be able to progress further with life and possibly start another relationship?

TL;DR I have become very protective of tapes my girlfriend made for me before she died. I am somewhat obsessive over them."
"My [19M] therapist [30sF] talked about me/disclosed (minor) information to my friend [19F] who is also her patient, and I feel a little violated.


After a couple years' break from being in therapy, I started going again a couple months ago. The therapist assigned to me, ""Sally,"" seems (seemed?) like a good fit for me. I like her and I had no complaints until now. 

I have a pretty close friend, ""Leah,"" who I've known for four years, but only started getting closer to in the past year. Leah's been in therapy for at least a year for her BPD, through a program that grants her the funds to attend therapy without it being billed to insurance, but according to her, this program doesn't allow her to switch therapists. Leah occasionally vents to me about how she doesn't like her therapist, because her therapist constantly reiterates that she can't treat Leah because her case is too severe, without offering any alternative options. Recently, she mentioned that her therapist's name was also Sally, and we pieced together that we are both seeing the same person. We laughed it off, and I wasn't too concerned that she didn't like Sally, because we are each being treated for vastly different things, and I figured that Sally was less equipped to treat BPD and more equipped to treat my issue (PTSD).

Yesterday, Leah and I met up to have dinner and play cards, and Leah told me that during the therapy session after we found out we both see Sally, she (Leah) had told Sally that she and I were friends. Leah then said that she had joked offhand in her most recent session that she has no friends, and Sally had disputed that by telling her that I had listed her on my intake sheet as a friend I can call in an emergency. Now, obviously Leah knows that I consider her a good friend, and I know she considers me a good friend too, so it's not like she was necessarily learning anything new about how I view our friendship, but I feel weirdly violated by the fact that Sally told her this. I don't know the ins and outs of confidentiality, but I'd assumed that the information on my intake sheet stayed between me and the therapy practice. I already have a difficult time fully trusting therapists because of a bad experience with a previous one, and now I feel like some of the trust I'd started to build in Sally has been eroded.

Also, like I mentioned before, Leah tells me that Sally repeatedly tells her that her case is too severe for Sally to treat. After telling me about the intake sheet thing, Leah said that Sally had suggested to her that she should come to *me* for advice on the issues she presents in therapy, because *I* might have better insight. ??? I told Leah that I'm always happy to be there as a listening ear, but that I have no beyond-Wikipedia knowledge of BPD. Leah said ""Yeah, I know. I don't know why Sally suggested that to me."" She seemed just as confused as I was. 

Switching therapists is an available option to me, but I like Sally aside from this and she's so far been helpful. I might also be totally overreacting; the PTSD-related issues make it hard to tell sometimes. 

---

**TL;DR**-- My therapist told my friend who is also her patient that I listed the friend on my intake sheet as someone I could call in an emergency. Therapist also suggested that the friend should come to me with the issues she talks about in therapy. I am uncomfortable."
"My girlfriend [F28] and I [M28] have class differences and it's making me hesitant to commit.


My new girlfriend and I have been dating for about 1.5 months. We've had fun together, we're sexually compatible, we want similar things out of life. However, we've also had a lot of arguments so far. Most of them seem to be clustering around the issue of class. She comes from a very dysfunctional background (poverty, abuse, addiction-- not hers but others around her) and has made a lot of herself. She put herself through college and has a great career now. She actually earns more money than I do.

My background was middle-class. My parents helped pay for college. Initially I felt a lot of insecurity next to her because of what she has accomplished based on what she was given. But I told myself it was in my head.

.... Turns out it's not all in my head. She says that it's really hard for her to ""empathize"" with me and every time I tell a story about my parents or childhood she gets upset. She says it's because she can't imagine having all the advantages I've had. Which makes sense but.... it's honestly very exhausting, I feel like I can't even talk about my life with her. Plus it's confirming my fears that I'm not good enough for her, and ultimately I'm not sure if I want to be with someone who could be harboring resentment towards me.

We've been monogamously dating but we're not officially a ""couple"" and I think she wants more of a commitment from me but I am on the fence.

\*\*TL;DR; : my girlfriend and I have class differences and it's making us resentful and less warm to each other. How do we resolve this or should we not commit?\*\*"
