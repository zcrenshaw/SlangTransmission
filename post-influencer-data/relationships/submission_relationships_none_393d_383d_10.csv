"Thanks!! (29F with 60sM)


Hello all, just wanted to let you guys know that I took advice from (mostly) creeping here over the past few years and accomplished what I originally thought impossible. I have a relative who I vehemently disagree with on politics/religion/life, but I love his spouse so I take her when I can and know he's part of the package. I hosted a dinner yesterday, and he said something extremely racist and I used a tactic I learned here - play dumb and keep asking him to explain what he means. I kept asking him to explain until he FINALLY had to explain the racistness, and then I just grey rocked and said ""Oh, I don't think that's funny"" in a very dry voice.

&amp;#x200B;

It shut him up and the rest of our evening was lovely. Thanks for the tips guys!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Learned how to deal with jerks thanks to this sub!"
"Update: I (24F) think my dad’s ex girlfriend (50sF) is stalking me



You can read the original thread at [this link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/99dlda/i_24f_think_my_dads_ex_girlfriend_50sf_is/)

First I want to clear some things up about my job. I work 4AM-8PM Monday through Friday. I get paid for driving, so the 2 hour commute to and from work is included in those hours, not on top of them. I don’t work for any school - my company is a contractor with many different schools. It is illegal to make employees work so many hours where I live, but most of the people who work here either don’t care because the money is so good or they quit early on. I don’t want to say what I do specifically because from there it would be easy to find out what company I work for which I imagine could get me in legal trouble.

I didn’t want to call my doctor yesterday because I was afraid to leave work and because I didn’t want my coworkers or anyone at the school to hear what was going on. However, I ended up doing so because I noticed there was a teacher with my last name (which is also my dad’s, and is quite rare unlike the girlfriend’s common name) and I panicked a little. I excused myself to the bathroom and called my doctor, who advised me to come in, and then I told me coworkers I had to leave because of a medical emergency.

I was not medicated before, but I have now started a new medication which will hopefully work. I have some mental exercises that I used the one other time I have had a really bad delusion like this (I thought my house was infested with fleas but they were really just on the dog) and they’re helping to ground me. I think I am afraid of my dad trying to get back into my life (he does this every so often) which is why I jumped straight to thinking it was his ex stalking me, and my doctor agrees.

I also have put in my two weeks notice at work. I have enough money to get by for the next few months if I can’t get another job right away, and this job is destroying me physically and mentally.

I did also buy a CO detector but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I also live with my fiancé who is not having similar symptoms.

Thank you to everyone who replied to the original post. I’m sorry I worried you.

tl;dr I’m not being stalked, I’m just crazy "
"Our [26f, 26m] neighbor [30s f] of 1 month is VERY extroverted and VERY clingy. We feel trapped in our apartment. She is being clingy even after talking to her about it. Help!


We're introverts, we don't like being around people generally and desperately want to be left alone. We come home from work exhausted only to be bombarded by The Friendly who will literally wait to listen to see if we're moving around so she can ""accidentally"" stumble upon us in the hall and try to talk to us. We'll be about to go out in the hall to go somewhere and she'll hear our keys jingling -- we will hear her unlock her door and open it a little to look so she doesn't miss us. Lately we've been opening and shutting the door, then listening for her to run downstairs and open her door and say ""oh hi!"" then silence when she realizes there's no one there, then she runs back upstairs and THEN we sneak out. It's like a freaking horror movie or scary game.

We have talked to The Friendly about how we're introverts and not really social. She started crying last time and saying ""I'm so sorry, I'm such a burden,"" which resulted in us comforting her and telling her we really like her and reminded her that we're just not people-persons. It was awful. But it didn't help. It didn't even take the edge off. Neither did getting coffee once, in an effort to make a specific time to talk to her; she just clung MORE.

I've had it after today and we're considering switching to another apartment in the building (which would cost $1000 if we do it before December... but we're really getting that desperate). I was taking our dog out to go to the bathroom and he REALLY had to throw up. I didn't have time for fake tricky door games. I rushed out with him before he could vomit in our apartment, and The Friendly followed me out, calling ""oh hiiiii, haha we're coming out at the same time agaaaaaain."" I called back over my shoulder ""I can't talk right now, sorry!!"" and kept going. JOGGING.

She CHASED me.

Literally RAN after me, RAN down the stairs behind me and when I got outside with the dog to vomit, started talking my ear off. I'm not exaggerating, this lady literally PURSUED me out the door and down two flights of stairs. Then when I brought him back inside, tried to follow me into my apartment because she wasn't done talking.

I'm sick of living like I'm on Seinfeld. If talking and hints don't work, then what? Is our only option seriously to move?

\*\*tl;dr\*\* Clingy neighbor utterly unstoppable even after talking to her about it.

"Update: Coworker Found My Boyfriend (27M) On Tinder And He Swears Up And Down He Doesn't Use It


[Link to original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/96tmu5/my_26f_coworker_found_my_boyfriend_27m_on_tinder/)

My (26F) last post didn't get too much attention, but I figured I would update as 1.) it's cathartic and 2.) things got pretty intense. Essentially, if you didn't read the last post, my coworker's housemate spotted my boyfriend (27M) on Tinder. He said he didn't use it. Which was clearly a lie, as many of you stated.

I truly wanted to believe him when I made the post, even though my gut (and the evidence really) told me not to. So I made a fake profile with one picture and no bio and searched for him with no luck, I matched people to keep the algorithm working but didn't send messages. I left it at that for the time-being. 

I saw my boyfriend last weekend and I still didn't get an explanation. Or an apology. Or anything even near the truth. So I decided to snoop. I'm not proud and I owned up to it, partially because he had some weird exchanges with girls. This isn't important to the story, but when I confronted him, I got half-a\*\*ed responses and we continued to hardly speak throughout this week. He also is currently at a festival this weekend, so I was still feeling even more insecure. I had no explanation for TWO possible cheating situations now. I was a bit tipsy last night and decided to bring up the old fake profile, setting the distance on maximum to pick up the festival location. And what do you know, he appeared.

I was too afraid to match him so I messaged my coworker's housemate. She stopped by my job the other day to introduce herself and apologise for the whole situation. Apparently her ex-boyfriend also had a tinder profile and that's why she ended things with him -- she said she had my back and would keep an eye out for me. I thought she wouldn't find him when I told her, as I was under the impression that profiles disappear after you swipe left. However, she found him and they matched. 

I texted my boyfriend immediately saying it was over because he's still on Tinder and here's where it gets insane. He responded that his best mate has apparently been chatting on Tinder with a girl from my country and living in my current city. My coworker's housemate is from my country, which is super rare. It honestly wouldn't surprise me that she would get on with my boyfriend's best mate. I know she has friends that live in his town and is there from time to time, because she said that's why his profile came up straight straight away. Anyway -- when my boyfriend's mate went on about her, he thought immediately thought I was being a catfish so apparently he decided to download Tinder at the festival to try to catch me. Honestly, I can sort of see why he'd think that in a roundabout way because we're very similar. Still, I told him that his accusation and excuse for being on Tinder was ridiculous, although I owned up to making a fake profile to try to find him. I also said I know the girl who was chatting his mate, because she's the one that found him originally and matched with again him today. 

I then reiterated that we were through because there is obviously zero trust between the two of us. I don't think I was right in snooping and making a fake profile, but I felt as if I deserved the truth. I also asked if I needed to go to the GUM clinic, even though I'll go anyways. He said he would respond tomorrow, but it's well into the afternoon and nothing. Closure is overrated, I guess. I'm pretty numb to the whole situation, although I'm gutted that I'll lose our mutual friends because I'll be the crazy ex who catfished their mate. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr -- My now-ex-boyfriend 'wasn't on tinder' but I caught him on it at a festival. Instead of owning up to it, he accuses me of catfishing his best mate. Our relationship is over.

"My [17/F] mother [43/F] has been telling my entire family I have anorexia when in reality it was healthy weight loss


About a year or so ago I hit my highest weight ever, about 235lbs (I'm 5'7"" for reference) and decided to make a change to my lifestyle. I am now at a healthy weigh of around 135lbs, and am happier and more confident than I have ever been. I ate about 1500 calories a day pretty much consistently to achieve this weightloss, and have since stopped losing weight and am now trying to build muscle.

This is relevant because my mother, who is about the same height and has been morbidly obese (280ish lbs) my whole life has been telling my family that I lost weight because I'm anorexic. Though I was not the most confident at my highest weight, I have never restricted my calories excessively. I've told her this, and that my weight loss was healthy and achieved through proper diet and exercise, not starvation. She says that my perception is skewed due to the anorexia and that I don't eat enough.

**TLDR: I lost around a hundred pounds over the past year or so in a healthy way. My mother keeps insisting that it wasn't healthy and instead that I'm anorexic. How can I get her to stop?**"
"I [24m] just found out my girlfriend [24f] and best friend [25m] have been fooling around


I never thought I’d even be writing in this sub but I’m just at a loss. About 10 months ago my best friend was leaving to go overseas because he’s in the military. A few days before he left we had a party for him and I noticed him and my girlfriend were talking most of the night which isn’t weird because we’ve all been close for years but they were definitely a little touchy and flirty. The next day I saw a text on her phone that seemed a little sketchy but I really can’t remember what it was because I wasn’t looking through her phone it was just a text I saw, but it was something that I needed to bring to both of their attention. I called them both out on it and they both said I was totally wrong and even got offended that I’d even think like that. I apologized and just trusted my 2 best friends that I’ve had for the past 8 years wouldn’t do something like that to me. So fast forward about a month ago and he comes home, every thing seems to be great, up until a few days ago. On Wednesday we all went out for drinks and us 3 ended up crashing at my girlfriends place, I wake up and go to work and  friend is still sleeping on the couch. Later that night I’m with my girlfriend and she’s acting way different then she usually does and I just got suspicious again. The situation that happened last time has been in the back of my mind and I should have just trusted my gut the first time this happened. So this morning, I did what I shouldn’t have done and snooped through her phone and saw a text that pretty much confirmed they fooled around right after I left for work. I haven’t even said anything to either of them, I don’t even know what to say or do, I’ve just felt numb all day but I can’t just do nothing. I’m going to lose both of my best friends and all of us are in a close group of friends that all live within 2 blocks of each other, I’m sorry for ranting, I just haven’t had anyone to talk to about this 

Tl;dr found out my best friend had fooled around with my girlfriend and I still haven’t confronted them yet "
"My [24F] new boyfriend [24M] doesn’t understand the magnitude of how messed up my childhood was. He makes comments about how he wishes I was closer with my family and it’s really hard to hear.


Hi r/relationships! 


I have been seeing “Alex,” for a little over a month now and things have been really great for the most part. One of the things I am most attracted to about him is that he has a really big, tight-knit family whom he is very close with. I grew up with a mentally ill single mom, who was extremely abusive in basically all of the ways one can be. 

I have PTSD from growing up in that environment but despite all of that I am somewhat well adjusted due to lotsss of counseling, medications, and really great friends. 

The issue is that Alex doesn’t seem to understand how or why I don’t want to have any type of relationship with my mother. I have told him that she was abusive and is mentally ill (untreated Borderline Personality Disorder) but I haven’t gone into detail about how or what she has done to me exactly. 

I know that Alex’s intentions are good as he really just wants me to be happy and he seems to care a great deal about me and my feelings, but this is one thing I just don’t know how to deal with. 

His comments remind me of being younger and having teachers, friends, parents of friends, and coaches all tell me the same things: Try to get along with your mom, try to be nice, try to be patient, it’s not your fault, etc. Basically, anything to remove personal accountability for my mother’s actions and instead putting all of the pressure on me to keep the peace. Which, in theory, would work if I was a bad or volatile kid but despite all that I was a pretty great child. I got straight A’s, I played sports, I was on newspaper and yearbook, I had lots of friends. On the outside, aside from some emotional regulatory issues, one would assume I had it all together unless I told them otherwise. 

My entire life was spent trying to be as perfect as possible in order to avoid conflict. These coping skills serve me well in 99% of interactions I have with others— I am not quick to anger, I am patient, I am excellent at resolving problems between myself and others. But my mom is that 1% where no matter *how* many tactics, skills, psychological tricks, or kind words I spoke, I could still end up getting beaten in the middle of the night or having my hair pulled out if I “hurt my mothers feelings.” 

I don’t want to tell Alex these gory details ^ which are just the tip of the iceberg, but I also want him to understand why it is literally not possible for me to just, “get along,” with my mom. 

I don’t know how to have a strong future with him if I can find a way to address these issues without causing him to run for the hills upon hearing how bad it actually was. 

I really need some advice here on how to approach this topic with him in a way that he actually understands. He even says his own childhood was essentially perfect and so his empathy is not really an option here, yet I also don’t want his sympathy either or to feel pitied or looked at like a kicked dog. I want him to perceive me as a strong survivor, not a victim, but I also really don’t want to keep defending myself as to why I am not close with my family. 


**TL;DR** *My new boyfriend wont stop encouraging me to “fix” things with my mom but he doesn’t seem to understand how literally impossible that is, or why I don’t want to because my experience is so different from his. How can I gently explain these things to him in a way that he understands while avoiding looking like a victimized puppy or an attention seeker?*

"My girlfriend [24F] of 2 years gave me [26M] some nude photos as a surprise gift. But I found a friend of mine [M] took them and I feel really uncomfortable about it.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and it's great.


Last week, out of the blue, she said she had a surprise for me. She gave me a photo album, and it was a collection of nude pictures of her, that looked like they were made professionally. She told me she did a private photoshoot because she wanted to give me a sexy surprise.


She's normally really shy so this would have been a big thing for her. It was really sexy and I really appreciated the gift.


But then I found out that it was a friend of ours (male) took them. I'm really uncomfortable that my friend has seen my girlfriend naked and has photos of her. It kind of feels like cheating, but I'm not sure.

TL;DR my gf let my friend take nude photos of her"

"I'm (29M) about to break up with my boyfriend (27M) of two years after he scoured through my apartment


  

I really torn about it and just thinking about it hurts like hell. 

Let me preface this by saying that my boyfriend suffers from severe relationship anxiety. 

On last Tuesday I invited him over as he had a meeting the next day early in the morning and my apartment is closer to his workplace. 

On Tuesdays I have psychotherapy appointment and as such I left he alone at my place while I was out. He mentioned he might go to gym while I was out and would let me know.

When came back he was very quiet and aloof for which I inquired what was going on. He sat me down and asked me if I had anything to tell him. I replied negative and once again asked what was going on. 

He took a deep breath I admitted going through my things. Mainly he said that while on the bathroom he saw a toilet paper on the trash with what seemed like cum and from there he start looking and found in my laundry basket a underwear he said had a cum stain on the back. From this, he accused me of cheating and having unprotected sex. 

I just sat there half-mad at it half shocked. I replied I had not done such a thing and stand in silence while he started crying. I added that I had indeed jerked off recently but could not explain the stain at the underwear. I had nothing else to say, I mean how you go about proving a negative.

I felt deeply disappointed at it; it was not the first time I had to take this kind of accusation in its many forms. I wanted to scream and cry. Instead, I sat there dumbfounded.

He then proceeded to mention how the fact that I wasn't actively trying to defend myself let him confused. I them pointed that I saw no point in trying to fabricate an explanation for something that I had not done, and if he wanted to show me the said underwear. He proceeded to storm to the bedroom and take one of the underwear from the laundry basket to show me. He would turn it repeatedly in his hand without finding the said stain for which he says that it must have dried. I claim that no cum stain would dry without leaving some mark on a pink fabric for which he says he is sure it was cum from what it looked and smelled and it must have dried from how much he handled it. 

We go back to the living room where he cries a little more and then proceed to tell me he had also read a notebook in my room. One which I had explicitly asked him not to read. 

This notebook is one that I meant to use to take note of things that I discuss on therapy, I'm not one to write by hand a lot as I hate my handwriting and as such it don't have a lot written on it. What it had however was an uncomplete list of desirable traits that I looked in a partner. It was an exercise of self-knowledge to see what I valued and what I could live without.

I got pissed; it took a great effort for me not having a full-blown argument right there. I refused to let him speak about it or to discuss anything of what was written there, that was not for him. 

I mustered all my strength to keep myself cool. He went on how he was sick and needed to look for further help, how he wanted to believe in me and so on and so forth. I was not about to quick him out as at this point it was rather late. I then went to make dinner for us and we sat in silence watching TV. He cried a whole lot. It pained me seeing him like that. I don't know if it was right of me but I hugged him trying to comfort him. At the time I had not yet had time to think about what to do nor how I felt exactly. However, I put myself aside for a moment for him. 

We haven't spoken properly since then. I'm torn on what to do. On one side I don't see we recovering, this is just the last thing on a long series of issues we have and I'm so exhausted of trying. On the other side, I love him to bits. He has been my rock at times when things were not so great. And I know that anxiety is a real mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boyfriend went through my things and proceed to accuse me of cheating. This kind of accusation and anxiety is ever so common on our relationship. I don't know if I can keep going and I'm really confused right now."
"UPDATE: My [30m] boyfriend's mother is dying so he basically dumped me [28f]


Link to my previous post [the backstory](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90xr6o/my_30m_boyfriends_mother_is_dying_so_he_basically/)

So after he breaks it to me that he doesn't want me in his life after his mom dies, I gave him some space for a few days. And after a few days he did get back in touch with me. It was a little distant, but basically like nothing had changed. He went down to see his mom and spoiler! She's still alive, at least as far as I know. Granted, her health isn't great, but she's still with us.

He gets back and continues to engage with me as if we are together, although it feels distant. He's been having some health problems and claims to be in so much pain that he's not able to talk or text me very much. His health issues are not new- a few months ago he claims he was diagnosed with an ulcer. But then every time I communicated with him, he kept hinting that he may have a more serious problem. This turns into suggesting that he thinks he has stomach cancer. I know him to be a bit of a hypochondriac but I know that he's really not feeling well so I leave him alone when he asks me too, and offer to help take care of him. He refuses my help, although he thanks me for my willingness to be there for him. 

The other thing that keeps me from feeling too worried about him was that he has been milking the ""cancer"" angle for a while. Earlier in the year he was losing a lot of weight and was worried he had cancer- turns out he did not. Then his ex got cancer and manipulated him into helping him take care of her as she underwent a surgical procedure. I was uncomfortable with that situation but I felt like it would be selfish and petty to be anything but supportive. Then later this summer he claims his sister-in-law (with whom he is very close) also has Hodgkin's stage 4 and demands that I leave him alone all night (which I did.) So when his feeling crummy escalates from ulcer to stomach cancer, I'm privately a little skeptical but I offered up my support. And regardless of what it is, I've been VERY worried about him. 

So after he finishes summer school, I was hoping that we'd be able to spend some time together. He claims that he's still in too much pain to call, text, or come visit. But on Wednesday he lets me know that he's going camping. I was frustrated by this because he claimed to not have time to see me for six weeks, but he was able to make time to go camping. He claims that it's a networking thing, and that he will be uncomfortable and in pain every minute, but he just HAS to go. He then asks if he can stop by on Monday. But Monday doesn't work for me- I work on the weekdays and wouldn't get to spend any time with him.

I tell him that Mondays aren't such a good fit for me and ask if he can make time for me on the weekend, because I don't feel close to him anymore and I want to spend time reconnecting and spending actual time together. He says he  can't because he's going out of town, and then started to guilt trip me about ""what he's up against,"" and tells me that he might not even be able to see me on Monday because depending on how his tests go, he might start chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. So now ""stomach cancer"" has morphed into straight up Hodgkin's lymphoma- NONE of which has been actually substantiated by an actual diagnosis. I back down.

Later I text him to apologize and tell him I didn't realize how tight his schedule was. He texts me back ""I f#cking hate you right now.""

So naturally I didn't respond to this. Later on he tells me that he needs me to ""not be in his life for a few weeks"" while he ""figures out his health stuff."" I tell him that the feeling is mutual, and that being sick is not an excuse to be mean to me, and that wanting a voice in the relationship doesn't make me selfish. I also told him that ""if apologizing to you makes you irate, then you need to leave me alone.""

He responds by saying ""I will leave you alone forever. Goodbye, ApartPersonality. I won't block you but please don't contact me."" I have not heard from him since, and I have not tried to contact him. And I'm ok with that.

I feel lonely but I also feel so much less stressed out. I'm not even upset this time. I didn't realize how much the fake emergencies, guilt-tripping, cold-shouldering, and just all around unpleasantness had been weighing on me until it was gone. I'm starting to suspect that this dude has actually mental problems. I highly doubt he actually has cancer- it's just another pretense to gain emotional control, create a false sense of urgency, and use it to subject everyone else's needs to his.

None of my other relationships have been this dramatic and chaotic. I think he secretly LOVES drama and creating it makes him feel wanted. I think I've finally gotten to a point where I can move on with my life. 

**TLDR:** Dude is actually probably crazy, tried to use cancer to manipulate me, now I'm out. "
"My GF [28F] of two years thinks I cheated and gave her Chlamydia. I [30M] absolutely did not.


Throwaway because she reddits.

A week ago my gf Sarah txts me to come over ASAP. When I get there, she's asking me over and over 'who is it? What's her name?' I'm laughing because I think she's joking. Then she tells me that when she got her pap smear results, they told her she tested positive for chlamydia.

To be clear, I've been with this girl for 2 years and have not had sex with anyone else for the duration plus another 3 months. I even took an STD test before we started and it was clean. Nor do I have any symptoms. I tell her all of this and she point blank accuses me of cheating on her. She says she spoke to the doctor (a campus doctor where she works who isn't even her family doctor) and the only way she could have contracted it is through sex, and since I'm the only one she's been with, then I must have gotten it from someone else and gave it to her. 

She broke up with me and basically tells me to get the fuck out, so I leave. I IMMEDIATELY head to my family doctor and get a full STD test done. He gives me a prescription for some pills while waiting for the results but I haven't taken any yet. Meanwhile, she's ignoring my calls and texts. I've been with this girl for TWO YEARS. I love her. Her family know me. All her friends know me. We were gonna move in together next year with the aim of getting married soon after.

Days pass before she finally picks up the phone, to which she sounds emotionally dead. Giving me one words answers and short sentences. I tell her I've taken my test and will get the results soon. She says it doesn't matter because if she has it, then I have it regardless (pill, no condoms) and that she doesn't need closure. That the worst thing about it is I'm not man enough to just admit it and am a liar. 

I go on her Instagram. All pics of me/us have been removed. On Facebook, virtually all of her friends/family have deleted me. A few even msged me to tell me how disappointed they were and never pegged me for a cheater. I ignore it. This is turning into a nightmare. 

The next day my test results come back. NEGATIVE. I ask my doctor if he's sure. He says you can never be 100% but the tests were thorough (blood, urine, weird lollypop stick thing in my cock which was not fun at all). I call Sarah, she answers and it sounds like she's been crying. I tell her my test came back negative and I can email her over a paper copy. She says she knows.

Shortly after we broke up, she'd went to her own family doctor and got a full STD test done (as recommended by the campus pap smear doctor). It came back negative same day mine did. She hadn't even picked up her prescription yet so it couldn't have been the pills. She says her family doctor explained that false positive chlamydia results can sometimes pop up during a pap smear and that the other doctor should have advised her on this. 

A wave of relief passes over me. Then she bursts into tears. After a few minutes of crying, she reveals that she told EVERYONE about what happened. She claims she'd went into some breakdown after thinking I'd cheated and had to go stay with her parents. The 'truth' was blurted out and it spread from there. Her mother told a bunch of the family and friends. Sarah told her best friends, who told everyone else. 

Apparently everyone knows and it's all that's getting talked about. That i cheated on her, gave her an STD and she broke up with me and went through a breakdown. She's been getting texts from friends, family and people she isn't even in contact with to give their condolences. All of these people basically now think I'm scum of the earth.

And then it hits me. She never gave me the benefit of the doubt. She immediately thought the worst of me. Even when I KNEW i didn't have an STD, i NEVER thought that it was she who had it and cheated. the thought never crossed my mind. She said she was confused because the campus doctor seemed so sure, but why not wait until I get tested too?

For the first time since we've been together, I actually hated the sound of her voice. I abruptly got off the phone and have been ignoring her. I figured I'd take a few days to clear my head and think straight. I loved this girl so much, but I'm so fucking mad at her right now. 

So here we are. She's still calling me multiple times a day. Texting me how sorry she is and how she's told her parents and friends about what actually happened. How can I face these people again? I'm embarrassed. Every time I think about it I get angry. If it was just me and her, okay I'd be pissed that she didn't trust me but I think we could work through it, but right now I feel humiliated. 

Oh, and I checked Facebook. Guess who got a bunch of new friend requests? Fucking DENIED.

Any advice you can give would be appreciated. I honestly am 50/50 about the whole thing, despite how I feel about her. Is this anger going to go away?

My parents adored his girlfriend because they were convinced she will give them beautiful and cute grandbabies. She is mean, selfish and difficult to deal with but my parents tolerated that because she was beautiful.

Two days ago she mocked me for having a flat chest and said she wouldn't be surprised if I had a surprise between my legs and I was really a boy. This wasn't the first time she was saying mean things to me because of my chest. I was very upset and told my brother what she said to me and they had a fight and he broke up with her. Breakups are sad but I can't say I'm not happy that they broke up. He finally grew a spine to stand up to her for me and I love him for that.

My parents say I acted like a child and ran to someone else to solve my problem and it costed my brother's relationship and their chance of having someone as beautiful as her in our family. I don't get them. Did I do anything wrong?

"UPDATE: I (27f) asked a guy (mid 20s) out and now I feel dumb.


So this is an update to a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92pc4d/i_27f_asked_a_guy_mid20s_out_and_now_i_feel_dumb) I made a few weeks ago.

I think it is important to note that I work at a liquor store not a grossery store.

I went back to work a week later and there was a note in my locker that said: 

""hey Acusalo-con-tu-mama text me or call me whenever you want to go out for that coffee. Xxx-xxx-xxx, Alex""

I found out that he came in later that day and asked for me and my coworker told him that I had already gone home. Alex asked when I would be back and my coworker said that since I am a model, sometimes I have to travel for weeks at a time and he wasn't sure when I would be back. My coworker told me that after he told alex that I was a model alex said something like ""I am a construction worker, why is a model even interested in me""? Alex told my coworker that he felt embarrassed because when he came in he was wearing his work clothes and wanted to go back home to change and then come back with his number.

When I like someone I like them for who they are as a person not for what they do for a living. besides, I only asked him out in the first place because I feel ""*something*"" whenever I see him. He makes me nervous in a good way and I ended up texting him. I said ""Hi Alex, this is Acusalo-con-tu-mama from the liquor store. I am still interested in going out for that coffee""....

This is where things get fucked up. He never texted me back. He went through the trouble of going back to the store, bring his note while making an effort to look nice, tell me to text or call him if I'm still interested and when I do text him he ignores me.

I have been away for the last couple of weeks and will be back into work on Friday. Hopefully things wont be weird if i see him. I wont bring anything up though. He ignored me when I made the move to see him and I think he should have at least texted me back and said he wasnt interested. 

**TL;DR: guy I asked out on a date came back and left me a note with his phone number but when I texted him he ignored me***"
"I [26F] think I'm being stalked by an old acquaintance [26?M], and I think my FWB [27M] is helping my stalker. Am I going crazy?


This whole thing is making me feel insane and I seriously need someone to tell me if that's the case. So, ""Nate"" and I met on Tinder four months ago and have been hooking up regularly (1-2x per week) since then. We are just friends with benefits, but we're very close and have shared a lot of intimate personal things with each other, and I honestly consider him one of my closest friends.

""Greg"" and I worked at a summer camp together six years ago when we were in college. We weren't really close and didn't hang out much, but I always thought he was a nice guy and we stayed in touch a bit via Facebook in the year or so after camp. We went a few years without talking (just him liking all my profile pictures, etc), and then recently he messaged me asking if I'd ever go on a date with him if he came to my city (he lives almost 500 miles away). I tried to turn him down kindly in a lighthearted way, but he kept making  flirtatious comments, so I eventually just stopped responding. 

  
Last week I got a message from Greg saying that he was in my city for work (I'm questioning this reason now), and would I like to grab a coffee and reminisce about camp. Stupidly, I agreed (again, we weren't really close friends during camp, but I still look back fondly on that summer and was excited to relive it for a minute). The coffee meet up was very weird and uncomfortable, and I wound up leaving early because he wouldn't stop trying to talk about my love life. 

Since then I have run into Greg SIX TIMES. I've seen him at the grocery store by my apartment, at the movies when I was there alone, walking down a random street, getting lunch on my break at work, in the Apple Store waiting for my phone to get fixed, and most recently, outside Nate's apartment while I was waiting for an Uber home after a hookup. Every time I've been cordial but brief, and purposely refused to let him drag me into a long conversation, although he's definitely tried. I have no idea why or how he's still in town, but I noticed that his relative posted on his Facebook about missing him and hoping he's ""able to come home soon"" (the post was deleted next time I looked). He has also sent me hundreds (I'm not kidding) of texts and messages (everything from random memes to heartfelt essays begging me to be his friend). 

So here's where it gets weird. Nate (the FWB) was at my apartment and had jumped in the shower since he came directly from work. He forgot his phone on the floor and he got a notification. I thought it was my phone so I instinctively picked it up and saw a Messenger alert FROM GREG. Nate and Greg do not know each other; they have never lived in the same state. I have never talked about either of them with the other. The only part of the message that showed up on the lock screen was something along the lines of ""I think it's working, anything else you can think of?"" I should have just asked Nate what the deal was, but I was honestly extremely freaked out and I just made up an excuse for him to leave. I then looked on social media and saw that Nate and Greg just became friends this week. Then, about an hour after Nate left, I got a message from Greg: ""Plans got cancelled for tonight? Want to hang?""

  
I know I need to talk to Nate but I'm freaking out. I'm confused and scared and feel like I'm losing it. Am I overreacting about how weird this is? What possible explanations could there be??

\*\*tl;dr:\*\* My FWB is somehow connected with an old acquaintance of mine who seems to be stalking me. I am extremely frightened and confused but feel like maybe I'm just being crazy. "
"Me [32 f] with my husband [30 m] my husband's family regularly ridicules him and makes him the butt of jokes


tl;dr my husband's family makes constant cruel jokes at the expense of my husband and me by proxy. 

I don't understand it at all. My SIL (32 F) is the golden child and instigator very often. She has a better paying job, so I guess that makes her more valuable in the family. My husband is still in school and the baby of the family. He is studying for his PhD, so it's not like he is especially old to be doing what he is doing. He provides for me and our daughter just fine. His parents are not supporting us, but they act as if they are. The whole family makes jokes about my husband being childish and not having a 'real job' yet. They are pretty cruel about it. It hurts his feelings a lot. 


They also offer a lot of really bossy, unsolicited 'advice' that sounds suspiciously like criticism of our parenting. For example, I was 'advised' countless times by my MIL and SIL that I should cook fresh food for my daughter every day. I actually do that. They just assumed that since we had store bought baby food when we visited them (after driving eight hours to get to them) that that was all I fed her. It didn't matter how often I corrected them. 


It is getting to the point that I just can't stand it. My husband doesn't say anything. I don't either, because the family language is not my first language and I worry that I am misinterpreting the tone or I misunderstood a word or the context. However, it seems pretty clear that they are criticizing us and making jokes at our expense. This morning my MIL and SIL used the birth of a new baby in the family as another excuse to criticize my husband. 
ry

I don't know what to do. Should my husband or I confront them? Should we ask them to explain their ""jokes""?  We don't want to cut contact, but they make being around them unbearable. "
"My son [32] told me [63] and my wife [61] that he's planning on proposing to his boyfriend and my wife won't have any of it.


 
My oldest son came out to us when he was 21 years old, in 2007. Personally I never saw what the big deal was- my parents were Creaster Episcopalians so I have no strong religious opposition to it, and I knew for years that there was something he was holding back and that he was somehow unhappy, and afterwards he seemed so much looser and freer- he seemed at peace with himself for the first time in years.

The best I can say is that my wife held her tongue. She was raised Catholic and after Vatican II her parents started attending what they call a Sedevacantist church, which from what I can understand means that they don't recognize the Pope because they think he's too liberal. Naturally she insisted that all five of our children go to Catholic school and get Confirmed and all that, and I went along because I loved her and because I had no strong religious feelings of my own.

She didn't say anything, even to me, but I could tell she disapproved, the way she pursed her lips whenever the topic came up, the way she referred to every boyfriend our son had as a ""friend"" or a ""roommate."" I never said anything because I didn't want to upset that particular apple cart, and so I kind of brushed it to the side and assumed she'd come around eventually.

It's even more jarring when you consider what happened when I told my own mother, rest her soul. The woman was born in 1927, and when I told her the only reaction I got was that she resumed her normal grandmotherly henpecking with the pronouns swapped (eg, ""does he have a boyfriend yet,"" ""are he and his boyfriend thinking about getting married?"" ""are they thinking about adopting? You know your sister and her husband gave your father and I five grandkids from foster care after her hysterectomy"")

So fast forward 11 years, and my son tells us that he's planning on taking his boyfriend out to the Strawberry Mansion Bridge in Philadelphia and proposing to him when they're halfway across. Of course I'm delighted- they've been together three years, he makes my boy happy, and they're already looking into the process to get registered as foster parents. They bought a house in East Falls together a year ago. His sister and her husband are exoecting already, but I wouldn't mind getting grandchildren from him as well.

My wife purses her lips and says nothing. She hangs back while I congratulate him and wish him the best. Then the moment the door closes the first words out of her mouth are

""We're not going.""

I say ""of course we are- our son's getting married."" She says that it's a farce, and a crime against God, and that he can fornicate with sodomists all he wants but it won't be a true marriage. It ended with the first big, blow-up fight we've had in years and me sleeping in a motel room. It's been a few days and she's not budging- not only is she not going but she doesn't want me to go either.

How do I navigate this? We've been married 35 years and somehow this is the hill she's willing to die on? How do I get her to understand that our son's happiness matters far more than words written in a 2,000 year old book?

**Tl;dr: My gay son is proposing to his boyfriend and my wife is categorically opposed, and wants me to boycott it with her. I think she's being unreasonable and will go even if she won't.** "
"My 23F neighbor is cheating on her 23M husband...advice about how to break it to him.


We’re an older couple with a child, live in a townhouse, share living room and bedroom walls with our neighbors, a young couple. Thin walls. We’ve never had any bad relations between these people, we both have dogs that love visiting over the fence, never really much more than casual Hellos. 

The husband left for 5 months for work. Enter new dude, basically living there, arrives every afternoon, leaves early every morning. Wife has always had guy friends in and out, we don’t think much of it. Until we start hearing them having sex, wee hours of the morning, in the bedroom and living room. She’s a screamer, can’t miss her enjoying some sex. And new dude isn’t exactly quiet either. They’re loud enough to wake us. I’m toilet training my toddler, and I’m up anyway at 2 and 4 am to get our child into the bathroom. I can say with complete certainty that they’re pretty has been regulat sex going on the last few months. Our walls or so thin that I can even hear their after sex chats, word for word. Doesn’t help that our beds are a few feet from eahcother and windows open since it’s summer time. 

Husband has just returned. Seems oblivious. My husband and I feel like we have to tell this poor guy. 

Opinions? Please? "
"GF [29F] and I [30M] had a money talk - didn't get well


Been seeing a girl for 9 months, and we made things official official not too long ago. We do not live together. I decided to talk about money/spending habits today. Did not go too well.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

Looking for advice on how I should have approached this?
As well, what others think of this.

​
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

She is an entrepreneur(first time running a business) and it's going pretty okay. People are buying, not exploding, but there is growth, so all good.  I work in a startup myself, so while I have never created my own company from scratch, I did  join one as an early stage employee, and have seen what it takes to make one grow. I have helped in every aspect I can, and given feedback and suggestions when asked. I build software for a living, and have a sales background - so I feel relatively at home with an online business.

​
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

My GF wants a lifestyle where she can travel, work remotely when she wants to, and otherwise be free of a physical location by having a successful business. I think all that sounds amazing, and it's something I am working towards myself.

​
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was concerned/uncertain/curious about her finances. She just came back from her 3rd trip this year (Europe/Vegas/Asia) and is already talking about taking another one in December. I know she recently borrowed money from her mom to buy/invest in more product as she could not afford it herself, lives in a quite expensive apartment, and city life takes a financial toll in general.

​
&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

I asked her, curious and a bit worried how she manages to go from month to month. Perhaps I was a bit judgemental on her wanting to do another trip in a couple of months...the way I've been raised, if I have just borrowed money from my parents, there is no fucking way in hell I am then also going on vacations. However, I did not say that, what a way to start a real big fight.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

I tried phrasing my question the best I could, without questioning her decisions. Firstly, I wanted to know that things are good. Hear from her it's working. On a certain flipside, I am having a hard time understanding someone wanting to start a business, for it to be successful so you can work from anywhere, then yet, in my mind, take excessive time away from it. It feels like she is reaping the benefits of having gotten it to a working point, before haven getting it there.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

This shouldn't suggest she doesn't work hard, and goes completely MIA when she has gone on these vacations. Work happens intermittently - far from ideal though. It's just, currently, she's barely/if paying the monthly bills, and is borrowing money for more product - yet prioritizes these get aways highly. I am a tad bit nervous about this - because this could be my future partner :/

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

The fallout was, ""I can't believe you dont support me"", ""Are you jealous of me going on another trip?"", ""what is another $500, who cares"", ""If you could just walk a day in my shoes"", ""I need to enjoy life"",, ""my ex would have my back financially if I fail, I don't feel you would"", etc. I clearly brought up something she was unhappy about.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

She did message back hours later saying she had overreacted. I however have zero desire to have a conversation like this again.

&amp;#x200B;
&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**
&amp;#x200B;
GF is talking about going on fourth trip this year, while she has been borrowing money from Mom to make business work. I asked about her finances, concerned, curious, and perhaps a bit judging as to why she is reaping the benefits of a successful business before putting in the hours.

"She [F49] cancelled dinner on me [M49] three times in a row - what to do?


So I have had 2 dates with this lady I met online. On Monday she cancelled date #3 which was dinner at hers, saying she had to pick up her son from somewhere. We rearranged to Wednesday evening. Then on Wednesday, she said she had a migraine and so cancelled dinner. Date #3 rearranged to Saturday. On Friday, it was confirmed that it was still on for Saturday night.

Then today when I was asking if 7:30pm was ok, she sent this message: ""That's okay but would be easier if I didn't cook tonight as have Max and that will mean I'm cooking twice which I don't want to do really - esp as off to theatre this afternoon""

So, what is your opinion of this? To me, it seems selfish, unreliable, inconsiderate. Or do you think my perspective is out of whack?

**TLDR: She cancelled dinner on me 3 times. What should I do?**

"I [32m] am going to break up with my clingy GF [25f] and need advice


Hi, been in a relationship 1.5 years with my gf. She has become beyond controlling, emotional, clingy, etc. and I am not happy with her, and would be much happier without her. I'm going to break up with her, but I know that she's going to have a complete breakdown when it happens. Crying, ""What did I do?"", ""I've done everything to be perfect and it's still not enough"", etc. How long am I expected to comfort her after my short speech about breaking up with her? She'll freak out even more if I don't spend the subsequent 2 hours comforting her and listening to her sobs. I'd like to just say \[breaking up speech\] and I'm very sorry about all of this, but I need to go now. Is this wrong? I've never dated anyone before that's going to have a complete freak out like this.

TL;DR: Breaking up with clingy gf, how long should I stay after I tell her."
"My [31F] best friend [30F] is a mega bridezilla and just revealed that I’m pregnant, when I haven’t even told any of my own family yet, and even though I may miscarry.


I’m the matron of honour in my best friend’s wedding. When she asked me over a year ago, I was so psyched. My own wedding was very small and low key, and hers is anything but - and I was so happy to be a part of it. I love hosting parties, so I was especially looking forward to the shower and bachelorette that I could throw her.

This wedding has brought out the absolute worst in my friend. It’s been an endless source of drama for the past year, and not in the way that all weddings are - it’s crisis after crisis, and it came to a head this week.

I’ll spare you the details of past dramas, because this post would stretch for miles, but in summary: nothing anyone does is good enough,  so much work has been thrown my way that I feel completely used and burnt out, and the world revolves only around her. Example: my mom is going through chemo for a very aggressive cancer. My friend never asks how she’s doing; her sole topics of conversation is the wedding and how much she hates her future in-laws. I don’t expect my mom’s shitty cancer to monopolize our conversation, and I’m more than happy to talk about the wedding for hours, but seriously, an inquiry to see how my mom/I am holding up would be grand.

Ok, onto the actual issue. I’m eight weeks pregnant with my second child. Planned pregnancy, and the bride knew we were trying months ago and it wasn’t an issue then apparently.

I told her almost as soon as I knew I was pregnant - I wanted to get ahead of it and not surprise her when we go to a dress fitting, for example, and I refuse champagne. When I told her, I swore her to secrecy. I told her I wasn’t even telling my family or my husband’s family until we’re out of the first trimester because we’ve had a few miscarriages and man does it suck to have to tell your family you’ve miscarried. She said she understood and would keep it quiet. The wedding is in two months  and my dress is a loose empire waist - no one will know I’m pregnant there, and I was happy keeping it that way.

Earlier this week we’re off doing wedding things and she says casually that her future mother-in-law thinks I should be demoted to bridesmaid since I’m pregnant. My immediate response: how the hell does she know I’m pregnant? I think she was surprised I’d caught her, and she stuttered out that her fiancé told the mother-in-law. I don’t think that’s true, as I was on the phone later that day with her mother, who congratulated me. So now both sides of the wedding know.

I’m so incredibly pissed and hurt. These people don’t know my family, so I’m not too concerned about it getting back to them, but my immediate concern is what happens if i miscarry. I’ll presumably have people congratulating me at the upcoming shower, and I’ll either get to grit my teeth and say thanks to avoid drama/making the shower about me, or I’ll tell them what’s happened and make it the shittiest shower ever. I’m so pissed right now I’m leaning to option two. Obviously I’m hoping this pregnancy sticks, but with a history of miscarriages, this is where my mind goes.

I feel betrayed. I haven’t confronted her because in the moment she told me I was so shocked I froze, which is my go-to stress response. She doesn’t know how hurt I am. I’ve realized that this is the last straw of this friendship - the entire wedding has strained us, and this event did it in. 

My initial  plan was ghosting after the wedding. I’ll be a good matron of honour because it’s the right thing to do, but after she leaves for the honeymoon, I’m going to fade away. She’s so self absorbed I doubt she’ll notice. But then my husband suggested I just walk out, tell her I feel betrayed, leave the wedding, and end it now. And I can’t help but admit, I really, really want to - I am so angry that the thought of attending the wedding and hosting the shower makes me ill. It’s complicated by the fact that despite the wedding’s size, the wedding party itself is just me and the best man - there’s no obvious next bridesmaid to step up if I walk. 

Thoughts on what I should do? Burn this mother fucker to the ground and moonwalk outta here? Or act like a civilized human and go through with the wedding?

TLDR: mega bridezilla told everyone in her wedding I’m pregnant, even though I haven’t told my family, and even though I’m at risk for a miscarriage. I’m very concerned I might have to tell all of these random people I’ve miscarried. More than that, I’m betrayed and hurt by her behaviour. I want to do a runner on the whole wedding and end our friendship in flames. Should I?"
"I (27M) dont want to visit wife's(27F) parents all the time. Is that wrong?


We go married about 2 years ago and last year we moved to her hometown so she could be closer to her parents. The issue is that every weekend we dont have anything planned she wants us to go over to their house and just hang out. We have breakfast and then we just hang out. I told her that I dont want to go every weekend. She freaked out and asked, ""why not"" I said ""well I just dont feel like it."" Which is true I want to just be home. I told her I dont always need to visit them with her. I told her she can go by herself and that its okay, she hated that I said that. I guess I just want to know do I always need to go with her or can she go by herself? Also the live 10 minutes away. 

TL;DR wife wants us over at her parents all of our free time. I dont. Is that wrong?"
"Me [23F] with my husband [24M] of 2 years, I want to move and get a job in my field, he would rather stay put...


Here's some background for you all:

My husband graduated and immediately started working for a well known space industry that has many centers across the US. He's making good money, but he isn't all too happy with his commute or work environment.

I graduated, didn't get hired anywhere in my field for a few months, and finally landed a part-time job sort-of in my field of technology. This job only required a GED, i'm not getting paid what I should be for a BS in a STEM field, and there is no chance for full-time. My commute takes at least an hour each way due to high traffic, some of the people I work with are jerks, and I'm not paying off my student loans debts as much as I'd like are just a few reasons why I've continued my job hunt.


Anyway, I asked my husband a while ago where he'd like to move since I know he hates the state we currently live in. His choices were Texas, Florida, and Alabama. All places with space centers so he could work towards a mission he's passionate about. I personally dislike the weather in FL, so i ruled that one out myself. Looking at Texas, I realized that the area we'd move to has a higher priced housing market than where we currently are, leaving Alabama as my go to.

I did some job hunting around the area and they had quite a few entry level positions open for jobs in my field that I could only dream of getting in our current state. I applied, they interviewed me, and want to hire me for $50,000 more than I'm making now with significant opportunities to grow in the company and even switch roles to see which I'd prefer. BUT they wont offer relocation assistance and I still will be making less than my husband.


My husband says for him to move, i'd need to make more than him for it to be worth it. I suggested that I go and pursue the job, he can ride out his job until he finds another/his mission ends and then he can move down with me. He thinks i'm being impulsive, that i don't want to be with him, etc. Even though I told him I'm tired of being denied the same opportunities here and drowning in debt. 

I don't want to leave my husband for any period of time, but I don't know if this type of opportunity will come around for me here..


TLDR; Found a job making way more than I do now, husband doesn't want to move with me and doesn't want me to move by myself and pursue the job. Don't know what to do now.

"My bf (m24) doesn’t believe me (m26) that his brother (M21) continuing to stay with us is problem.


We’ve been together for 12 months and bf (Jacob) moved about three months ago. The apartment is mine and I have my workplace in the spare bedroom so I can work from home 3-4 days a week.  

His brother (Ryan)  came to visit for a week six weeks ago and is showing no sign of leaving.  

Ryan doesn’t have a job so hangs around all day. He’s sleeping on the sofa in my study so it’s making working hard for me ( I now go to office every day ) and I just don’t like him being around all the time. We have almost nothing in common and he keeps passing judgement on everything I do 

I have asked Jacob to tell him to leave, then when I found out he hadn’t told Jacob to tell ryan to leave and still he didn’t do it. I’ve now told Ryan he must leave but there is no sign that he’s going and I’m sure Jacob is undermining me and saying it’s ok. 

For me this a deal breaker with Jacob and when I told him this he just deflected and explained how hard it is for Ryan to go back to his own place ( shared with is ex gf ). 

I’m at the point where I want to just serve eviction notices on both just so I can have some peace.

TLDR : bfs brother came to visit and has moved in. How do I get him out. "
"Me [30 M] with my wife [29 /F] went NC with in-laws [60s/M&amp;F] and friends [20s-40s M&amp;F].


8 months ago, I was brought into a boardroom and told by HR that due to allegations against me, I was being suspended effective immediately without pay and benefits and asked for my keycard, my laptop and work phone. I was told not to contact staff or enter the premises. I was not told what I was being accused of or what the next steps were. I told my wife and she and I spoke to a lawyer. I prodigiously document everything and forwarded emails to myself as a backup. The lawyer was perplexed and completely baffled. He advised me on what to do, what not to say and sent them a formal letter requesting information. We heard nothing back for three weeks. The lawyer sent a follow-up letter and still nothing. 

During that period, I was radio-silent. I was shocked, angry, upset and confused. I told people I was dealing with a personal problem and couldn’t hang-out or keep up with social activities. My blabber-mouth SIL told friends who told other friends who told everyone they could find, that I was being accused of “something” at work and that all they knew was that I was home. My wife told me to start going out to get my mind off things, but texts weren’t returned, emails ignored, messages left unread. Everyone in my social circle dropped me. I got two terse emails from the wives of friends telling me I was a cad and a scumbag and not to ever contact them again – we have a big summer holiday planned and they informed me I was no longer invited (my wife could come with the kids, but not me). It was like being stabbed all over again. 

Three weeks later, on like a Thursday at 10:00AM I get a call telling me to come in the following day at 9:00. I figure it’s a firing and call the lawyer. He emails me a list of do/do not and sends me a letter he wrote. I get there and my keycard, phone, computer and other assorted items are there. They hand me back my stuff and tell me I’m fully reinstated and that they are done and attempt to walk out. I demand answers and they can only tell me “accusations were made, an investigation conducted and we’re reinstating you.” I asked if it was on my HR file and the two tween girls with a bottle of perfume on each have no idea. I ask about why I am being reassigned to a different department, and they have no idea. I pushed hard enough to speak with an actual HR director who told me that the accusations against me were by a single employee who no longer works at the company, that they were baseless and a thorough investigation was conducted. I called the lawyer who called bullshit but I started work the following Monday. 

They had destroyed my name. They had spoken to colleagues, my direct managers, my reports, and staff; they read all my instant messages on the company system, my emails and reviewed meeting minutes. They found nothing, but their investigation had trashed my name. I was a pariah at the company. Colleagues had said it wasn’t so much an investigation as a data gathering initiative to get enough dirt to fire me but that they found nothing. The woman who made the claims was terminated with cause very shortly after I had been accused and for 2 weeks they had people just digging dirt. 

I scored a minor victory. I was offered a parachute and agreements that they would allow references but I had to sign NDAs about what transpired. It was a good deal and I was able to start a business. Once I settled, my wife and celebrated and took the briefest of vacations. Then people started coming back out of the woodwork. “Hey, I didn’t get your text!” or “your email went to my spam folder!”. My in-laws started talking to me again, my SIL was buddy-buddy, and the woman who disinvited me from the vacation ‘re-invited’ me. My family opted to do something else that week and went to Hawaii instead. I’ve not spoken with most of those people in months and generally am happier now. 

Since then, I’ve cut everyone out. Friends, family, acquaintances. My wife took my side and now has an incredibly strained relationship with her parents, sisters and most of our mutual friends. I was so hurt at how quickly everyone turned my back on me that when they came back into my life randomly I sent short, to the point, emails/texts telling them that I never wanted to hear from them again and to delete my contact info, then blocked most of them. 

I’ve been speaking with a therapist who hasn’t said one way or another what I should do. My wife doesn’t want to push me, but I’m worried maybe I shouldn’t have. I’m worried about the effect it has on my wife’s relationship with her family and friends and while I do have very unpleasant opinions of them/feelings towards them, I worry about how she’s being duly impacted. When I ask my wife, she stresses her need to support me but is coy about what she’s feeling. I’m a bit at a loss as I’ve never endured such a fracture of so many relationships so fast. 

I really need outside advice on managing these relationships/my going NC. Should I ‘fix’ what I did? Should I stay the course? What would you all suggest?

Tl;dr spurious accusations against me at work resulted in friends and family abandoning me. Close friends and relatives, people I trust and cared for. Once it was determined I hadn’t done anything, they all wanted to pretend like nothing happened. I went NC with all of them but worry I was too extreme.

"Spoiled (30sf) whole life and now trying to be a real person, struggling.


Hey,
Sorry if this is rambly and weird, Im having a rough time

This all sounds so stupid and first worldy but I am seriously struggling. Im in my 30s and have been spoiled much of my life. I was the youngest of my family. While I was a child we were poor but then my dad made a career change and we were suddenly doing quite well. I had no obligations or expectations on me. I see as an adult that I was neglected a bit. I think my parents were done raising kids before I came along.

As I was a good kid as a teenager, didn't do great in school but I didn't cause my parents many headaches. I was never punished for anything though. Bad grades? Broke a window? Supposed to clean my room but didn't? Just ""don't do it again."" And I'd just get the same words next time it happened. 

I had a few jobs as a young adult. Cashier at Target then later data entry at a mortgage loan firm. I only worked at Target for a month and the firm for three. So even that experience is small and kind of sad. 

At 21 I left my job at the firm to marry my husband and move with him to Canada. He's in the Navy so for the next 12ish years we've moved around while I was a stay at home wife. We didn't want kids so it was easy to afford our lives without me working. I'm not blaming my husband for spoiling me in that way but I wish now that we had made different decisions.

Now my husband has retired after 20 years and we've moved back home near my family. His retirement pay is alright but extra would lessen the burden. He's been looking but hasn't found anything yet.

I got a job as cashier/stocker at a local small grocery and I hate it so much. I get this terrible tightness in my stomach/chest just thinking about having to work tomorrow. I feel like puking and crying all the time. I just flatten out and can barely have a conversation with my husband when i get home. The job is totally fine, everyone is nice and its pretty laid back but it's so difficult for me to handle. I feel like such an idiot and a child that I can't do what everyone else does almost every day of their lives. My husband tells me he's so proud that I got a job but it hurts so much just hearing that. How can anyone be proud of this? I don't want to disappoint him by quitting. I don't want to quit because I worry I'll never get another job if I do that. He tells me to talk to a therapist but when do I do that? There's no time for anything! I get home and have to recover for like 3 hours then I might have an hour or two where I feel normal but then I start worrying about having to go back the next day.

What do I do? Is this anxiety? Depression? Does everyone else feel this way? My whole body hurts with the stress.  I haven't even worked there very long. He keeps saying itll get better. How is that even possible? Will this feeling just go away in a few weeks? I don't know what to do.
 
Thanks for listening. I have to go to work and writing this was a good distraction. I'll reply when I get home.

Tldr: 
Never worked and now I am. Hate it, hate it hate it. Is this anxiety? Do other people feel this way about their jobs?"
"My (28F) boyfriend (32M) has suggested moving into my house. However, I am not ready for this and there is a large difference in income.


I'm on mobile so I apologize for any formatting or spelling errors, I'll make this short as I'm in need of quick advice. Also not sure if this post would be better suited in personal finance. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend of 4 months has suggested moving into my house (that I own) as it would allow us to see each other more and for some other reasons. However, he brings in much less money than me. And most importantly, I'm not ready for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Just some kind of relevant information: I've owned my house for almost 2 years, bought it new. This summer was expensive as I was finishing my yard, got a fence built, and property tax also went up. So I've had to dip into my savings a little to pay my mortgage. I'm not concerned as I know this is temporary and should be able to be where I was at financially in a few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend knows of my financial situation and knew that I could use a little extra money, so he offered to move in. He currently pays $400 a month to rent a bedroom in his friend's basement suite and thought that would be an acceptable amount to share my house, that’s also all he can afford at the moment. The thing is, just my house expenses for the month are anywhere from $2600 to $3500  depending on the month (mortgage comes out every second Friday). I can afford my house just fine, and have worked extraordinary hard for what I have. Sure an extra $400 would be nice, but that pretty much just covers utilities. I know my house is way out of his price range, so I don't expect him to pay half, but I can't help but feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I've always been a people pleaser and help people out when I can. But I think its absurd for him to even offer me that amount. I also think asking to move in after 4 months is a huge red flag but he disagrees. I'm losing respect for him. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - My boyfriend of 4 months wants to move into my house but there is a large difference in income. I think he's taking advantage of me.

"My (25M) girlfriend (28F) is absolutely enraged at me because I didn’t give her a shout out and I’m beating myself up over it. Was I wrong?


So yesterday I had my medical school white coat ceremony. She was the only one there because my very supportive family had actually planned a vacation months in advance. We all had written a little blurb before the ceremony to “describe ourselves in 140 characters”, and the idea was to read it out loud on stage to the audience (which I had no idea we even had to do until the ceremony began). As people were going up in alphabetical order, they would read their blurb and shout out people, so it became sort of what everyone did. However, I have stage anxiety and when It was my turn I blanked out and just said “I want to thank my loved ones, I love you guys” and proceeded to read my blurb and got off the stage as soon as I could and walk around and go give my girlfriend a quick kiss. Right after the ceremony ended I Ran to my my gf and I could tell that my girlfriend was mad, so I asked what was wrong? And she let me have it, and started getting enraged and calling me names and telling me that she’s the only one that was there so she deserved to get a shout out and that I don’t deserve her nor appreciate her. I explained to her my anxiety and that I blanked out, and i explained how much i appreciated her and what she meant to me, and it was all from the heart,  but she thought it was an excuse and just didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t even get a chance to take pictures with classmates or do anything because she wanted to storm off. I truly feel guilty and I wish I would have singled her out, but I believe her reaction was unwarranted. Was I wrong? Because I’m really beating myself over it.

TDLR: Girlfriend is mad that I did not give her a shout out at my ceremony."
"My [29F] dad [55M] forced my sister [16F] to have a pregnancy test and a urine sample for drugs when her boyfriend [16-17M] dropped her at home last Friday.


I don't know the exact details because my sister was very upset when she told me, but dad pretty much broke into her room in the morning and forced her to have a pregnancy test and collect urine so he could have it tested for drugs.

My sister said she was super sleepy and didn't really get it at first and said ""can't we do it later?"" and he got even more upset and said she was just trying to trick him and if they do it later the drugs will be off her body by then. So she collected the urine and did the pregnancy test (negative). The urine test also came up negative but he said he should have waited more so he'll have her have dinner early one night and take the urine 12 hours later and test it again.

Jesus, just writing this. What.The.Fuck.

Dad was a huge hard ass when I was her age but he never did anything as crazy as this. Mom has always enabled him. She's never been a bad mom but she doesn't stand up to him when he does the crazy stuff, just kinda smooths things over for us *after* dad is done with his behavior.

My sister came to me a few months ago so I could talk to her about contraceptives, etc. She's definitely being sexually active with her boyfriend, but as far as I can tell they are both pretty smart and do it safely.

She was *bawling* when she told me what happened. It was traumatizing for her. So I am here feeling like an idiot, just wondering what the hell can I do? I mean I look at my options and there's nothing. Even worst, I might move to another state with my husband for work in the coming months, which may or may not be permanent, and she'll be left alone.

How can I help her?!

**tl;dr:** Dad forced my sister to have a pregnancy and urine test because he's paranoid and crazy. How can I help her? What can I do for her?"
"My best friend upset and overreacting just because I slept with a mutual friend.


I [17F] have been friends with her [17F]  for a really long time. I’ve never done anything that would bother her or upset her. So, we both met him [16M] around the same time but she was more close with him and I would only talk to him when we would see each other, we wouldn’t really hang out. She on the other hand, hung out with him everyday but only as gym buddies. I started worling out with them since I started to gain a bit of weight.

Wel, it was obvious asf that he liked her and she was just toying with him. I talked about him with her and she said that he was cute and nice but that she would never date him she just wanted to be good friends wih him. Then I told her how I found him attractive and that I actually wanted to be with him and she didn’t say much. I started hanging out with him and going on dates with him, so basically we are kind of boyfriend/girlfriend now. 

She found out and she started being distanced and cold toward me. I asked if my relationship getting serious with him was bothering her and she said yes and told me I had no consideration for her feelings at all. Wtf? Then she started texting him whenever he was sleepig over/out with me and she would call him a player and always want his attention. Is it really MY fault? What do I do? I really like this guy

TL:DR Best friend upset because I started seeig a mutual friend"
"I [21M] have been offered my dream job several states away and I'm having trouble deciding


The job is over 600 miles away and I would be leaving my girlfriend, immediate family, extended family, and all my friends behind by accepting it. 

The job is at least a two year commitment if I take it, but I would be doing exactly what I want straight out of college. Quite frankly, there are very few jobs in the field I want to work in where I live now and the ones that are here are likely to be very dull. The job I've been offered also pays more than I could hope to make after 10 years of working where I live now straight off the bat. 

I only have one month to decide whether I'm taking it and I'm really stuck. I don't feel like I can commit to leaving everyone I care about behind for two years, but at the same time this seems like an opportunity I can't pass up. 

If anyone has been in a similar position and has a story to share, I would really love to hear it. 

TL;DR: Can't decide whether to take my dream job or continue to be near the people I care about. "
"My [24f] coworker [32m] shows me pictures of his baby everyday - am I stuck doing this forever?


Context: I have a very friendly demeanor and am very smiley and appear to be happy/excitable -- I've been told this my entire life and it's just my personality (even if I'm feeling sad inside or something). I also work in an open, sociable company (~100 people); all the coworkers are quite friendly with each other and we're fairly tight-knit.

My coworker - he managed me for about 4 months during a project - recently had a baby with his wife. Maybe 4 months ago? Anyway, I was very happy for him, and when he first shared pictures of his newborn, I said, ""Aw! She's precious! So happy for you guys!"" Or something to that effect. I don't know, things the average person says to a new parent!

Anyway, ever since then, he'll stop by my desk once or twice a day to show me a picture. One time he did say, ""You're just so happy when you see her"" so I can't tell if he genuinely believes he's doing me a favor by doing this.

It can get distracting at work but... I also don't want to see pictures of her everyday. That being said, I'm not confrontational in social settings and I feel like this is a very minor issue. I don't want to be rude and say something, so my default is, ""So cute! She looks just like you, it's crazy!"" and try to walk away. Anything else I could do here?

Tl;dr: My coworker had a baby and seems to believe I am so enamored with her that I want to see pictures of her at least once a day."
"[F22] I unfriended my landlord on Facebook and he [M30s] freaked out.


I rent a room in a house in which the landlord (the homeowner) and also his wife live on the premesis. I'm 22 year old female graduate student and he's a late 20s graduate student. He also one other tenant on the property.

I think the landlord is creepy and I don't like him. For example, I did three loads of laundry in one day and he confronted me about it and informed me I didn't know how to use the machine properly. I do indeed know how to use the machine, but I wash towels, delicates, and casual clothes separately. He works from home and never leaves so I often feel like he keeps an eye on my every move. He also texted my mother last weekend asking her for her email address... I find that ridiculous since he has her phone number for emergencies only and there is never a situation in which he should be emailing her! He also has a lot of rules that apply to me as a tenant but don't apply to him, such as if I have a guest over I'm expected to let him know in advance, but he's had guests over without ever telling him. He also told me I can't open the windows in my bedroom, that I can't have a desk plant, etc.(These rules are not in the lease, but 
I follow them.) 

He had also asked me questions to the effect of ""Is your department obsessed with women and affirmative action?"" And ""do you attend church just to please your boyfriend?"". I find the former question quite offensive because we're both in highly male-dominated fields and I felt like he was suggesting that I didn't deserve the position I earned. The latter question I think is ridiculous because if you formulated that as a statement it would be clearly offensive. 

I was friends with him on Facebook but due to him contacting my mother and other offenses, I decided to unfriended him. Around a week later, he friended me again so I blocked him on Facebook. Ten minutes later after blocking, he texts me ""Did you block me on facebook? I would like to have a good relationship since we will be living together for a year."" And I said ""Sorry but I don't consider having my landlord as a friend on Facebook a requirement to having a good relationship."" He responded with ""Well, we were facebook friends and now we're not, so that's obviously a problem! I hope we can resolve it."" I think this is bizarre since he would have only known that I blocked him if he went searching for my FB profile. I rarely post on Facebook so it's not like he would notice that he stopped seeing my posts. Personally, if someone unfriended me on Facebook I would probably not notice unless they were someone I speak to daily on Facebook messenger. 

How should I handle this? I just want to be left alone in peace. 

tl;dr: I unfriended my landlord that lives on the premises and he freaked out. I think he's obsessed with knowing everything I do because I live in his house."
"I (36m) find out my SO (30f) lets an ex-sexual partner she met on an online dating site sleep in her bed every Friday and Saturday night… Apparently I'm the one that was in the wrong for feeling trust was breached?


I (36m) find out my SO (30f) lets an ex-sexual partner she met on an online dating site a few years ago, sleep in her bed every Friday and Saturday night when I am out of town…. and still had an active OKCupid profile. She says they are friends, that they just get drunk and high, and fall asleep watching TV in bed. When I find out, I was out of town, said I needed to go offline and clear my head. Got back, and I was deleted on Facebook, phone blocked, etc. We were due to marry this month. (She also lied about them being ex-sexual partners… ""just a couple of dates"", and then later I learnt it was a lie)

Apparently I was the person in the wrong!. She went and consulted all her friends, asking them is it okay, without including the detail that they are old sexual partners, just to prove to me that I was wrong and over-reacted. Of course her friends said she was right, but I find out she never informed them about being exes. When her friends found out, they called her a liar.

Anyway, it transpires that pre-me, she used to drive 3 hours to places to hook up with guys in polyamorous relationships, boasted about threesomes with exes etc.

Am I right to be upset, or owed an apology for the breach of trust for her sleeping arrangements when I am out of town? I've been called controlling, emotionally needy ++ etc because of how I felt betrayed.

Would really love to gauge what other peoples' emotions would be on this one.

**TL;DR Find out SO lets an ex OKcupid ex-sexual partner sleep in her bed every Friday and Saturday night… am I wrong to be upset?**"

My boyfriend is currently out of town for a month and we facetime every morning. Today, I had cramps and when we facetimed I said I can’t talk long cause I wanted to take medicine for the cramps

A couple minutes later the medicine kicked in and I texted him. He then accused me of just talking to someone and using cramps as an excuse.

"I’m (27f) seriously dating a lifelong family friend (28m) and my mother (52f) is extremely against it. Kind of at a loss.


So my mom has been best friends with Judy since they were in their teens. They’re like sisters. I have known Judy all my life and she and her husband Mark are like second parents to me. My dad passed suddenly when I was 15 and Judy and Mark were instrumental in helping me and my mom get through it. My mother became estranged from her family when she was younger, so Judy and by proxy, Judy’s family became her family. 


Judy and Mark have a son, Alex, who I have known literally since birth. We were raised together, kind of like siblings or cousins. We went to the same school up until high school when I started going to a specialized school, and went to different colleges. Alex and I always had our own friends but were close since our families were close. We ended up starting a casual FWB thing after college, and realized we had serious feelings for each other and have been a couple for the last year and half. We wanted to keep our relationship to ourselves for a bit, mostly to see if it would work and also just have something that was just for us. Long story short, we’re in love, happy, and decided it was time to tell our parents. Judy and Mark are thrilled, and my mom....is not. She seemed happy at first but later told me she thinks it’s wrong? I asked her to
elaborate and she kind of dodged the question and said that it was strange since Alex and I were raised like siblings.  


I’d like to stress that Alex and I are NOT blood related at all, and before this my mom thought that Alex hung the moon. She loves him for sure, I’m just baffled as to why she’s so against us? Alex is slightly hurt because he cares about my mom a lot but he also thinks something else is going on. I’m not breaking up with him, but I love my mom and want to know where she’s coming from. I’m just unsure how to proceed. 

TL;DR: Told my mom that I’m dating a long time family friend/her second son (essentially) and she’s taking it very badly. "
"My (32m) wife (32f) of four years has found a new group of friends and stays out all night. Am I right to be upset?


My wife for most of our marriage hasn’t had many friends and honestly we’ve had a pretty co-dependent relationship that we’re trying to work on. She’s recently found a new hobby and with it has come some new friends. She’s happier than I’ve seen her in a long time and and I’m truly happy for her. 

Enter the problem, she’s been going out for drinks with her friends a lot recently, they’ll close down the bar and then usually go to someone’s house nearby, sometimes not getting home until 3 or 4 AM. Earlier in our marriage I used to do similar things after getting off work late and it was an issue with her and she would often be upset about her husband getting home so late, so I stopped doing it. Now that I’ve expressed that I really don’t want her out that late she doesn’t see the issue and sees it as controlling. 

It’s not that I don’t trust her or that I think she’s up to no good, I just don’t want my wife being out until 4AM, and thought that it was a clear boundary in our relationship. Am I being overbearing? Any advice would be appreciated

TL:DR My wife has been staying out all night with new friends and doesn’t see the issue. "
"After my wedding, my sister [40] made some upsetting comments and I'm struggling with how to respond and move on.


I [M29] got married a few weeks ago to a special woman I've been with a number of years. We have a wonderful, loving and respectful relationship and our wedding was amazing - both our sets of families and friends were genuinely blown away by the family focussed celebration. We were inundated with lovely comments over how much people enjoyed themselves and how they loved the wedding day. 

However, my sister [40] was in attendance with her son [10]. She has gone through a divorce and then recently a subsequent break up with a boyfriend. She is a difficult character, very sensitive. My brothers and other sister have spent our lives treading on egg shells around her. She has had a difficult run with relationships and my siblings and I have worked to support her. She also has this chip on her shoulder that myself and my other siblings are the favourites. Other context is that she lives in another city and we don't see her that often. 

As with most weddings, we didn't get to spend much time with everyone. This was disappointing but it's the reality. 

We thought everything went amazingly and were really pleased with it all. However, the day after the wedding I get a call from my sister. She made a number of statements essentially saying ""I didn't feel welcome at the wedding, I couldn't wait to get out of there. I got a really bad vibe from it all and [wife]'s family."" She then went on to say ""You need to watch out and not rush into anything, like having kids or something.""

I was completely taken aback and this took me by absolute surprise. I had to get to an appointment so I told her this was incredibly inappropriate and upsetting and I got off the call. 

My wife's family has been amazingly welcoming to me and my family. They hosted the wedding and were incredibly gracious. My wife has worked hard to make a good impression on my family so the criticism is completely unwarranted. I have simply not spoken to my sister since the call and I haven't told my wife what happened. 

I'm now unsure how to move forward. I'm worried that my sister doesn't understand how upset she made me and possibly thinks that she was in some way warranted in making the comments. Im still furious and I want her to understand that. I'm always the family peacemaker and I'm angry that I feel this internal pull to resolve the situation. She is the one who has hurt me and I want an apology. 

TL;DR sister made awful comments about wife and wedding and I haven't had any contact since then. Not sure how to proceed and move on."
"My good friend (31F) is online dating a married man (38M) whose wife has terminal cancer. I desperately need some advice please…


I've known my friend for years. We’ve always been very close and we would always share everything with each other. Almost a year ago we started playing an online game together. We made different friends in the game and she became very close with the guy from the post title. They started talking about his wife's cancer and it brought them closer and they fell in love. I had no idea any of this was going on until a couple of weeks ago but it’s been going on for months. It slipped out during a normal little chat we were having. She never meant to tell me about it.

She has always been a good person. She’s thoughtful and caring and helpful. And she has very strong opinions about cheating. But I know she also wants to be loved and be in a relationship. She was feeling very lonely for years. And she's going through a lot dealing with depression and things like that. She’s dated over the last couple of years but she says she never felt real love for anyone else and that this guy makes her feel that way.

She's saying it's not cheating because it's online only and they haven't met in real life or anything so it’s not like she’s taken him away from his wife. And she’s told me the guy still loves his wife. But I get the idea that he would leave his wife, but my friend would break up with him if he did that because she hates the idea of people divorcing. I think they’re waiting to see how his wife’s condition goes. I don't think his wife knows what's going on. She probably doesn't even know he's been talking to anyone from the game. And I have no way of contacting him or his wife.

I talked to her and told her that I don’t think this is like her and it's not a relationship that’s right for her. But she says she’s never been this happy or been so in love and that he’s making her feel better from her issues and that she doesn’t feel alone when she’s with him. I told her that I think it’s not fair to his wife and it would be better to break up with him. Now she doesn't want to talk to me because she doesn't feel like I'm there for her like a real friend would be and that she’s free to make her own decisions and that if she wanted my help/advice she would ask for it.

I have no idea what to do. I can’t tell what’s right or wrong anymore. Thinking about it I don’t even know if it was any of my business to tell her what I think at all. I just wanted to help. I can’t even reach her right now because she won’t answer my texts or calls and I’m too afraid that going to see her will just make things worse. It’s been a week now. I feel like I’m losing one of my best friends. Maybe I already lost her. Please I need some help. Was I wrong to get involved? Should I be supporting her decision to date him cause he makes her happy? What do you think I should do?

**TLDR: Friend won't contact me because I don't approve of this relationship. I don't know what to do.**"
"I [28M] told my girlfriend [28F] something she didn't want to hear


So recently I told my girlfriend that I feel like having time apart from one another, or us having 'me time,' isn't a bad thing every now and again. I explained that it wasn't something I wanted often... just every now and again. She immediately got upset by this and didn't want to talk about it. I tried to explain to her that all I was saying is that when we have a day or two apart, it makes things more exciting and more special when we actually are spending time together. She again wouldn't talk to me about it.

​

We've hung out several times since, but whenever I bring up hanging out now she says 'no thanks, your 'me time' is clearly more important.' Basically this is being held against me. I am just wondering what everyone's opinion is on 'me time.' I have a fantastic time when we hang out and I love her to death, but I also do enjoy having time to myself every so often. I am also not sure how to approach this without making her more upset because that is the last thing I want.

"My boyfriend [21M] wants me [20F] to pay for a part of his rent because I ""have more in savings and I basically live here"". This is wrong right?


My boyfriend and I have already had two fights about this and I really want to get a second opinion on our situation. 

Basically, my boyfriend of two years and me are currently college students. I still live in dorms on campus but last year, my boyfriend moved into his own apartment after having a falling out with his roommate. The city that our school is located in is very expensive so his small apartment is about $3,500/month. When he moved out of his dorm, he had a job with a local company as a programmer but he has since quit his job to focus on school. He was making pretty good money from that job so he was able to manage rent fairly well the previous year. Now, he's struggling a bit. However, my boyfriend is not that good with managing his money. He's a pretty big spender in terms of food (he eats out almost everyday, sometimes even two meals a day), has many online subscriptions, and regularly offers to pay for his friends despite not having too much money. 

Currently, I have about $250k in savings. Around $100k of that will go towards my tuition for the next two years and the rest of it will be for my tuition for grad school. My parents are covering my college tuition (included in my savings so kind of like a trust fund I guess) and the rest ($150k)  are all my savings from high school until now. 

I made the mistake of telling my boyfriend about my savings too early in the relationship so now he thinks I'm super rich and can afford to just drop money everywhere. I've told him countless times that this is not true. Finally, things escalated when around two weeks ago, he asked me if I'd be willing to pay for half of his rent since I basically live at his place. I almost laughed at his outrageous demand. One, I go there around once or twice a week during the school year. Two, the most I ever use from his apartment is the occasional shower. I don't even eat the food in his fridge because he has none!

I rejected his demand and told him that it was a bit much asking me to pay for half the rent when I sleep over only once every week. He then shifted his argument to the fact that I have ""sooo much in savings"" so it wouldn't hurt if I just pitched in a bit. I still refused. He then got pretty angry and called be ""inconsiderate"" and ""stingy as fuck"". Obviously I got angry as well so I hit him with the, ""then you should find a job instead of leeching off of your gf!!"". I also explained to him that my money was meant to pay for my education, not his apartment. I've also brought up his poor spending habits but he brushes them off and says that it's not the problem.  We had this type of argument twice. 

The thing is, I would definitely be willing to give him some money if he knew how to manage it. The problem that I see with him right now is that if he just cut his spending on useless stuff, he would have enough to pay rent. Also, he could just find a roommate! 

But maybe I'm being too harsh? This is wrong of him to ask right? I'd appreciate some input/advice. 

Thanks!

TL;DR: Boyfriend is bad with money but lives in a very expensive apartment by himself. He quit his job to focus on his education so now he has no source of income. He has recently asked me to pay for half of his rent since he thinks I basically live there (I don't). I refused and we've had two fights about it. This is wrong for him to ask right? "
"My (20F) boyfriend (24M) flinches when I move too close to him.


So, first of all,  I've never hit my boyfriend before. I grew up in an abusive household, and would never do that to anyone else. 

My boyfriend has never really opened up about his family and I've only ever gotten snippets of stuff that has happened when he was in high school, but he doesn't tell me much about them and definitely doesn't want me to meet them, even though we've been together for close to a year now. 

Recently, I realized that I was the only person my boyfriend flinches around. It's also not just little flinches,  he'll curl up on himself and close his eyes for a second before realizing I'm not going to do anything to him. This breaks my heart,  seeing this big 6'2 muscly guy look terrified of ME, a girl he could literally squish with one hand. 

I guess I'm here to ask for advice. I don't want to force him to open up, but I definitely would like it if he felt safer around me. How do I let him know he's safe and I wouldn't do anything like that to him, without forcing a conversation he doesn't want/isn't ready to have? What would you guys do?

TLDR;; My boyfriend flinches a lot around me, as if expecting a hit, and I just want to help him feel safe. "
"My [F28] husband [M30] unemployed, hypochondriac, and likely depressed. How to help?


Hubby and I have been married nearly a year, together for 4 years total.

In winter of 2017 he lost his job. After that he put in a lot of applications and got some interviews, it was looking like he'd be employed again soon. That didn't end up happening because none ended in a formal offer. Gradually he stopped searching and applying. I think the last app he sent in was a few months ago. 

The other thing that's happened during the period he's been without a job is he's developed a lot of anxiety about his health. I don't know if it's related to his anxiety about work or not but either way, sometimes his behavior reminds me of hypochondria. As the job search tapered off, his internet researching and armchair self diagnosis increased. He was never like this before. He's convinced he has a condition called morgelons disease, not sure how to spell. He analyzes every bump and mark on his skin, looking for what he calls ""fibers"" in his skin. He'll show me normal blemishes convinced there's some sort of foreign material in them that's infecting him. Some of the things he says are borderline crazy like that it's from the government spraying ""nanotechnology"" from airplanes. He's in multiple groups and forums about the disease he thinks he has. Sometimes he shows me pictures of skin lesions from morgelon's asking do I think that looks like what he has, when the picture is of an open oozing sore and his own thing is...a little reddish bump. He's so anxious he doesn't see the difference. Then, he'll try to dig out whatever he thinks is in there leading to a bigger scratch which he then says ""See look I told you it looks just like the picture!!""...I cannot reason with him.

I don't know how to handle this, he's not reassured by anything I say. He contradicts me every time I explain how he's overly worried. It's like his mind is made up and nothing will get through.

Now, note that since I work fulltime I can't know for sure what he does all day at home, but I'm pretty sure he's sleeping most of the day. Sometimes I'm briefly woken up by him getting into bed at 4 or 5 in the morning. Then I wake up for a real a couple hours later, go to work, and when I get home (around 6pm) he's groggy and still in his PJ's. Then he sits on the internet for the rest of the night. His sleep schedule is backwards which I know can be a sign of depression.

I know he's not happy. I know he's really discouraged about work and sees no point in applying so he doesn't, which just ensures he stays jobless. The only way to get a job is to apply. He doesn't see it like this. He believes there's no point. He also says he can't work now anyway because he has to figure out the morgelons thing.

Lastly, he has outbursts of anger sometimes. If I ask him to do anything, or confront him about him not doing something I asked (like getting dinner started, trash out...) he snaps at me. ""Who fucking cares?"" or ""I could be dying and you're worried about the trash?"" or ""shut the fuck up."" It takes a lot of arguing for him to leave the computer chair. When he does he's snippy and resentful.

This is really hurtful, and it makes me kind of scared. He never used to yell at me. I don't remember the last time he said he loves me.

I understand he's struggling but what can I do to help? I've suggested counseling, both therapy and job search coaching, but he refuses both. He has no motivation for jobs and believes therapists can't be trusted. I also said if he's so worried he has this disease he should see the doctor, he said the same thing about how doctors would just ""lock him up in a mental ward"" or report him to the government, which makes no sense.

I don't know what to do. How do I support him while not going crazy? How do I help him change his defeatist attitude about jobs and his health?

tl;dr: After more than a year of unemployment my husband has given up searching. He's also overly obsessed with his health when nothing is wrong with him. He shows signs of depression like sleeping all day, irritability, lack of motivation. How do I help? "
"I [22 F] hit my boyfriend's [27 M] friend [30 M] who put his hands on me.




I went to the bar with my boyfriend and a large group of his friends. Some I'd met before and some I hadn't. Partway through the night, someone at the bar who I didn't immediately recognize put his hands on me, grabbing my butt and squeezing. I jumped off the barstool and grabbed him by the back of the neck, and pulled his torso down while driving a knee into his stomach. He fell over.

Then I went and got the bartender's attention and said that the dude had been groping me. My boyfriend was trying to say something to me, but I asked him to hold off for a minute. The bartender kicked out the guy who had grabbed me.

My boyfriend asked me what was going on, and I said that rando had grabbed my butt.

He said the guy wasn't some random person, it was his friend. A friend I'd apparently already been introduced to.

I said I didn't realize; I'm bad with faces. But even so, I had been mad about being touched.

He said I should have told him, he could have sorted his friend out, without escalating as much as I did. He said his friend was just a joker, but pretty harmless. And I was lucky he was; I could have gotten beat if it had been someone less laid back.

I said that I didn't know it was a friend, and I didn't mind escalating. I'd rather take my chances than sit still and pretend I'm fine with being harassed one more time in my life. I used to be really passive, and it sucked.

I asked him if he was fine with his friend putting hands on me, because he sure sounded like it. And he said no, he was mad about it, but he would of rather dealt with it himself.

I just didn't think to tell him; I've had to deal with shit myself for long enough that it just didn't occur to me. 

----

Anyway, I don't want to be around this friend of my boyfriend's anymore. And my boyfriend said fine, but I feel like he's still going to keep this guy around.

Did I make a mistake by not telling my boyfriend to deal with it? I don't think i did.

TLDR : My boyfriend's friend grabbed my butt, and I hit him and got him kicked out of the bar. My boyfriend said I should of left it for him to deal with

"My GF [26F] is apparently stealing clothes from my mom [61F]. I [23M] don't know how to handle this situation


First of all. English is not my native language. Sorry if my writing is weird.

I live with my my mom and my brother. My girlfriend (we've been together for a year) has been coming to our apartment, we watch movies, have sex, and basic stuff like that.

There was a piece of clothing (a woman's jacket) that belongs to my mom. She found out that my GF has taken it (she saw it in her bag). She thought that this was some sort of mistake since she might have a similar jacket and stuff.

That happened like a month ago.

Recently my GF and I went to a trip to the beach of one week. We returned from the trip and we got to my home to chill and the next day she would be going to her own house with her parents. The Monday morning I left her there and I went to work.

It has been 2 weeks, I told my mom that my GF would be coming here for this weekend and my mom sadly told me that more clothing has gone missing (a bikini and some other stuff).

My mom swears that the clothing was there before we went to the trip. Right after my GF left, the clothes were missing.

I don't know what to think about this. I'm very stressed and confused. Maybe she's a clepto? Or she's just stealing consciously?

I don't know if I should talk to her about the issue or If I should talk with my mom and gf together.

Help me please. I'm going insane.

\---

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My GF, according to my mom, might be a kleptomaniac. And has been taking some of my mom's clothing. Please help me out on how to deal with this issue"
"I (24F) think my dad’s ex girlfriend (50sF) is stalking me


Let me start by saying I’ve never met this woman. I don’t speak to my dad because he abused me as a child and continues to try and fuck up the lives of me and my other family members to this day. I didn’t know his girlfriend existed until my dad disappeared to start a new life this January.  She reached out to my family and said he had sent her an email about how he was going to get out of her life forever similar to what he sent us. Apparently she’d broken up with him a few days ago because he forgot her birthday. My mom blocked her almost immediately.

I thought I would do the good feminist thing and tell her the truth about the kind of man my father is, especially since she has three kids and he can’t be trusted around kids. She had a lot of questions, and I talked to her for a few days, but stopped when I found out she’d actually proofread a very abusive letter he’d sent to my siblings and I. Apparently verbally abusing all his kids wasn’t breakup worthy but forgetting her birthday was. Immediately after admitting this she told me how nice it was that we were finally a family like my dad had always wanted. I ghosted her and unfollowed her everywhere but didn’t block her anywhere because that seemed unnecessarily harsh. She kept following me on Instagram and would sometimes like my posts but I didn’t think that was a big deal.

Recently I have had the intuition that someone is following me. I drive a lot for my job, and two days ago the same car stayed behind me almost the whole time. My job has me go around to different schools, and at the school I was at there was a staff member who looked a lot like her pictures and had the same first name as her. I can’t be entirely sure it’s the same person since I haven’t met her before but I can’t think of another explanation. 

Then yesterday I noticed a different car following me, so I faked my car breaking down and skipped work for the day. She couldn’t follow me when I was stopped on the side of the road but I think her car slowed down when it passed me. When I got home I checked my email and had 3 spam emails about horoscopes. She is a professional  astrologer.

I don’t know what I can do. I don’t think my evidence is enough to convince the police but I can just tell she’s watching me. I can feel her eyes on me and they’re driving me nuts. I don’t want anything to do with her. How can I make her go away?

tl;dr same as title"
"My [23 F] best friend [22 F] told me a painful secret. My boyfriend is upset I won't tell him details.




I've known my friend for 5 years, and been with my boyfriend for 2 years.

My best friend told me something very personal, about a traumatic experience had at the hands of a family member, during her childhood and teen years. She told me not to tell anyone, it was very hard for her to even tell me, and she would be humiliated if word got out. So I promised her I'd not tell anyone.

I went home that night, and I was really upset. I care a lot about my friend and I was upset to hear about this painful experience she went through. I ended up calling into work sick the next day because we were up late talking, and even after I got home I'd had a sleepless night over it. 

My boyfriend asked why I'd called in sick when I wasn't ill, that wasn't like me. And I told him that I hadn't gotten much sleep because a friend had told me something upsetting. He wanted to know who, and what, and I said that it was my best friend, but the details weren't mine to tell. 

He got upset over that, saying that if it was affecting me so much I took a sick day, it's probably worth talking about. I basically said again that it wasn't my business to talk about, and I'd be fine.

The next day or two, I wasn't in the best mood, both because I knew my friend is going through a tough time, and because I couldn't work out to relieve stress like I'd usually do, because I have a small injury.

My boyfriend told me that he didn't believe me when I said I was fine, he saw me looking stressed for days. And it was shitty of me not to open up, especially when me not opening up about my emotions had caused problems in the past. I said that it wasn't my story to open up about. And he just said ""you're doing it again"" like he couldn't see it was different.

So I'm stuck in the hard place of either betraying my friend's trust, or having my boyfriend think I'm keeping secrets and bottling things up. What can I do?

TLDR - My friend told me a painful secret, I took a sick day off work because I was upset and didn't want to go in. My boyfriend wants to know what's going on, and is upset I told him that it's not my story to tell.

"Guy (21M) who I'm (21F) not even seeing yet went through my messages


We've been in the same friends group for a while but were never that close. I know he's liked me for a while but I'd had a boyfriend until recently. For the past couple of weeks he's been coming over to my house and we've been hanging out one on one which we'd never done before. We have kissed 2 or 3 times but only when drunk, he definitely wants more but while I do like him I don't want to rush into anything after a fairly recent breakup. I've told him this but I think he's wary of getting messed around or lead on and so wants a resolution quickly.

Anyway yesterday we were watching netflix on my laptop and I went to the toilet. When I came back as I was about to walk into the room I was able to see him on my facebook messages. He was searching for his name in them. I made a bit more noise to alert him to close it in time and walked back in. He went home yesterday and we haven't spoken since.

How bad is this? Should it be a dealbreaker?

**Tl;dr - been hanging out and kissed but not dating or anything yet, saw him searching my facebook messages for his name, what to do?**"
"My (32m) wife's (31f) best friend and husband (also early 30s) moved into our town. My wife is a 100% happier person around the husband. What in the hell do I do? I'm so confused about this. Married 8 years.


This is my second ever reddit account and I usually only go on to browse DIY so please bear with me on this. I could give years of background but I want to make this readable. 

So my wife and I are definitely at a 7 year lull in our marriage. We have two kids we both adore (5 and 1) and I absoltutley love my wife and as much as life can drag now, I still have great memories of times when we were younger and much more free and daring. It also needs to be said that my wife is stunningly attractive, she looks better than she did in her 20s and his a hot yoga devotee and it really shows. I'm ageing and while she tells me she's still attracted to me, I just don't see how it's possible any more. We also still have a good sex life but she would want it every night, I'm more of like a twice a week is good. 


So anyways, her best friend from high school moved into our town. We knew it was happening from facebook and my wife was super excited because they used to be like sisters. Friend is now married with one kid who is also 5 so it seemed like we were ready made friends. 


So we met them the first time and all was well except the husband is like Mr Perfect, he's funny, he's witty and he's also fairly attractive guy. I've known my wife long enough to know the difference between her ""I'm amused laugh"" and her ""I'm laughing so hard I'm turned on"" and this guy was definitely getting more of the later. When we got home my wife and I had better, naughtier sex than we'd had in years. I mean it was pretty clear as day why. 

So since then its pretty much the same. When we make plans with this couple she gets really excited, when we are there she's like his attentive audience, when we get home she's like on a high that will last for a few hours. 

I also need to say that this does not happen when my wife hangs out with the wife on her own. On those occasions, it's just like ""hey going to Ikea with 'Marlene' be back in a few hours."" So its quite obvious she has a ""thing"" for the husband. 

To my knowledge she has never met up with the husband when it hasn't been the four of us. I also like to think that my wife would never cheat on me. Also she's had ""married crushes"" (as I have) before and she was very open and honest and because I didn't overreact, I feel like she feels she can be honest with me when it ever happens again. 

But this feels like something else entirely, it's almost like an attraction I can's describe. For my part, if she really does enjoy his company then I feel like I shouldn't do anything to stop it as long as it really is all on the up and up. But part of me also feels very jealous because I can't make my wife perk up like that anymore and feel like I should say something. But that could open up a whole other can of worms. 

basically, what do I do in this specific situation? Do I let it go and let her enjoy the time we have or do I need to speak up?


tl;dr: My wife is super happy before, during and after when we hang out with another couple and it's clearly the husband that is making her so happy. I just don't know what to do about it and I'm so confused because I am jealous but I also want her to be happy. any help appreciated.

"I'm [24F] preparing for my sister [17F] to move in with me when she turns 18. Parents are accusing us of ""breaking up the family""


The reason my sister wants to move out ASAP is the 31 year old step sister that lives with them at home ever since our mom married her dad. She doesn't have a job and I don't know why she doesn't work or why she still lives there. She's quite difficult to deal with. Ever since she met my little sister she was all about how she's her big sister and she's now the boss and demanded respect and authority. 

My sister is not that kind of girl. Our brother [26m] and I always treated her as an equal despite the age difference and always encouraged her to be her own person. We never expected her to listen to us just because we happen to be older. This whole ""big sister"" thing that the step sister keeps doing is so stupid and pointless. If you want your younger sibling to respect you and listen to you then be the kind of person who they can trust and respect. It takes time and effort build that sort of relationship. It doesn't just happen because your dad marries someone's mom when you're almost 30 years old.

We really couldn't find a way to deal with her or to get her to back off. It's like she doesn't even understand. Even when I had a serious talk with her her response was ""why do you talk to me like that? I'm your big sister too show me some respect!""

So a few months ago I suggested to my sister that she should move in with me. Our brother lives far away but he also offered to help out financially. But our mom didn't allow it saying it will cause problems in the family and in her marriage. So we decided that we'll do this once she turns 18 and we've been working towards that. She will now be 18 in 3 weeks and I've just moved into a larger 2 bed apartment. She just transferred her savings (from a joint account with our mom) into her own account. And she was able to get a part time job too which she'll start next month. This is all so that we wouldn't need any financial help from our mom. Between me, our brother and sister's part time job we'll manage. 

Now our mom is noticing that this is serious she's promising things to change and quite honestly we don't really care anymore. My sister told her that the only way she'll stay is if step sister moves out which isn't happening because she has no job, experience or skills. So at the end of the day, we're doing this.

Our mom came to me yesterday saying this has caused a big fight between her and her husband and making peace with the step sister is key in making sure her marriage remains stable. It looks like step sister is angry at us for ""excluding"" her even though she's actually done it herself with her attitude. Her husband is resentful that we're not treating her daughter as ""one of us"" which is absurd because she's not acting like she's one of us. We (brother, me, sister) have a group chat and that's where we do most of our texting and this step sister wanted in and demanded our sister for an invite which she refused and then this 31 year old woman threw a tantrum like a child.

Next month my sister and I are planning to fly to visit our brother and then the three of us are going on a one week vacation. Our mom wants to ""invite"" step sister to come with us (translation: step sister had thrown a tantrum that she wants to come) and we're really not keen on bringing her because she's going to make this miserable. If it's just the three of us we're gonna have fun and will be comfortable with each other, step sister will cause drama and it's going to be frustrating. 

So how do we deal with our mom who's unloading the burden of fixing her marriage onto us? When I think my focus should be on my sister who's turning into an adult and needs help and guidance. We're all just tired of dealing with this step sister and we want nothing to do with her. Would it make me a horrible person if I said we really can't help her and she's on her own?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom married a man with a 31 year old jobless stay at home daughter who wants to be respected and given authority over my 17 year old sister. After many failed attempts to get it through to her that she needs to back off, my sister is moving in with me. Our mom is saying the drama around this is affecting her marriage and wants us to make peace with this step sister, keep her involved and help her keep her marriage stable. Is it right for us to tell her that she's on her own? "
"I [27f] despise being a mother and wish I would have given them up for adoption. No one knows and I hate myself for it.


I’m a mother of two adorable, great kids. I love them dearly. I would be absolutely devastated if something happened to them. That being said... I’m an awful person and mother because I HATE being one. I wish I never would have had children. With the first I didn’t know I would feel like this, and when I found out I was pregnant with the second one I was two far along to in good conscious get an abortion ( I was using protection. I was the 1% that got pregnant anyway. Which is why I found out so late, I didn’t even worry or think it was possible. Just thought I was gaining weight.with the first I was just stupid and didn’t bother with protection). Somehow I thought I’d be okay though. 

I know it is not  my children’s fault I hate being a mother, they are my responsibility whether I want them to be or not. I will never tell them I feel this way and do my best to make sure they have a good childhood and feel wanted and loved. But when they go to bed... I cry quietly in my room. I hate it so much. I hate not getting to do the things I want, I hate not being able to go out and dance if I want, or go somewhere along. I hate feeling guilty about working a lot because that means they don’t see me, but then stressing if I don’t work because we are so broke and I’m the only income since their dad left. 

I wish it was just me. It can’t be. But I hate myself for hating motherhood and feel so incredibly selfish for wishing I’d given them up. I ALWAYS hear parents talk about how they are so glad their child was born and how they wouldn’t change it no matter what, they make their lives better, etc, and I say the same thing because I don’t want my kids to EVER be traumatized by my selfishness... but I don’t feel that way. If I could go back I wouldn’t have them. 

I’m an awful person. 

Tl;dr:  try to be a good mom so kids don’t ever know my true feelings and grow up with trauma, but internally despise being a mother and wish I’d never had them. Hate it so much I cry myself to sleep quietly after they go to bed. Am an awful person, obviously. "

"My [19F] identical twin [19F]'s boyfriend is constantly ""mistaking"" me for her


Hi, I was just hoping to get some perspective and advice on what to do in this situation. I'm honestly at a loss at this point and just really frustrated. For clarity I'll call my sister ""Alice"" and her boyfriend ""Jack"".

Alice has dated Jack for about a year now. Me and Alice both live together and because we happen to share a friend group  (Which Jack was previously a part of) I basically see him all the time. He's over practically every night and sometimes stays weekends, and is almost always present on group outings. I don't have an issue with that but he is CONSTANTLY mistaking me for my sister and it has created a really weird tense dynamic between the three of us (and creates awkward situations when we're with friends).  

This ranges from calling me her name and putting his arm around me to grabbing my ass or boobs or trying to kiss me. This happens every couple of days. He once actually got into bed with me in the middle of the night and acted like he thought I was Alice joking around with him and it took me actually leaving (after shoving him off me) and waking her up for him to leave me alone. 

It makes me feel super uncomfortable to be around him especially because Alice just gets angry at ME when I brought it up. I have ZERO feelings for Jack (I'm a lesbian, so even the idea of being with him kind of grosses me out). I don't even get along with him that well and I wouldn't hang out with him if he wasn't dating my sister or wasn't friends with my friends. I have also told him to be more careful and he just shrugs it off and says it's not his fault that we're twins and everyone makes mistakes. It has gotten to the point where I just sharply correct him and just avoid him when he is around and I avoid being alone with him. I honestly don't feel comfortable in my own home because of the constant tension about whether or not I'm going to have to deal with him. I can't really ask Alice to break up with him either because she talks about stuff like their future together and getting married, and I honestly don't want to ruin her relationship with him either, but I'm at the end of my rope here.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : My twin sister's boyfriend constantly makes moves on me because he thinks I'm my sister. What can I do about this? I don't want to have to move out or make a drastic change in my appearance but I'm feeling like these are the only options I have left. "
"My [21F] boyfriend [23M] is convinced that nudes sent to an ‘exposed’ group are mine


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for the past year and a half. We also attend the same university, and we live together. I know it’s a cliché, but we really did have no issues until this started.

For background on the ‘exposed’ group - it is billed as people at my university anonymously sending their (sometimes tasteful, often not) nudes to a closed Facebook group for other people at the university to salivate at. More often than not, nudes of girls (and very rarely guys) are submitted by ex partners or bitter lovers to ‘shame’ their former partner (this is still anonymous, as the sender of the photos is never revealed). The group has a firm rule on no identification in the photos eg. body only, no prominent birth marks or tattoos, no detailed location in the comments, and no photographs in the background. While this somewhat protects the genuine sender from harassment, it also means that the validity of the poster is always brought into question. I personally do not follow the page as I do not agree with the revenge porn element. My boyfriend also doesn’t follow the page, however we have mutual friends who do, and that is where this has stemmed from.

The other day I got home to my boyfriend sitting at the kitchen table with a blank expression on his face. He told me to sit down and take my phone out and show me my camera roll. I did, mainly because I had nothing to hide, and asked him what had happened. He wouldn’t say anything until he had scrolled through all of my recent pictures, then asked me where the nudes were. I’ll clarify here that we do send each other sexual images, but they are private and always on Snapchat, so they’re never saved. I said, candidly, that any nudes I took were on Snapchat, and he started shouting that I admitted ‘it’. He eventually calmed down enough to tell me that his friend had seen on the exposed group that someone had submitted a full-body nude that apparently was the spitting image of me. This friend deduced this because the ends of the poster’s hair were in shot and it was the same (very common) colour and style as mine, and the body shape was also similar to me. He’d forwarded the image to my boyfriend, who also believed that it was me. My boyfriend refused to show me the picture because ‘I knew what it looked like’, so I had to subscribe to the page and scroll down looking for pictures that may have been me. There were so many recent images that may have been me that I picked one of them at random, then found a generic nude image online also matching the description I was given and asked him to pick out which one was me. He picked out the generic image. I then asked him to google the very basic term I had used (so something akin to ‘petite blonde long hair’) and apologise. He apologised for getting the image wrong, but still maintained that the image he was sent was me. I told him how much it hurt that he didn’t believe me, and he said it hurt him that I would post my ‘secret nudes’ online.

I really want to be able to talk this through, but I don’t want to keep on proving my innocence. He seems fixated on the fact that the person in the image is me and that I have wronged him. I’m not going to admit to something I didn’t do, but I can’t take much more of this.

TL;DR - Boyfriend is convinced that a nude image sent to an exposed group on Facebook is me and isn’t hearing otherwise, do I keep on defending myself or just leave?"
"Girlfriend has tons of cameras around the house


I 23f have been with m girlfriend 24f for over 3 years.  6 months ago I moved into her house. She’s worked hard to be where she is at her age and has a large social media following. She’s had a homeless person in the house as well as someone thought to be a “fan” outside creeping around. She always had a high tech security system with cameras. But added cameras in every room and outside except for the bathrooms obviously about a year ago. She’s also got petcubes for the dogs. They’ve always weirded me out but it’s her house. When I moved in she assured me she wouldn’t be on them 24/7. Fast forward to now and it seems like she’s on them more and more everyday. If I face one of the petcubes towards the wall bc I’m home and don’t feel like being watched she’ll text me with in minutes asking why. If she sees me do something with the dogs she doesn’t like she’ll text me. She has all the cameras set to play on the screen of one of her laptops. When we are home together it’s always open in eyesight to “make sure no ones inside or outside”.  She says during the day she doesn’t have them up on her laptop because she gets busy but I’m finding that hard to believe. My friends don’t even want to come over because there’s so many cameras. 

TD;LR am I wrong to ask her to remove the cameras? "
"I (30M) found out my girlfriend (26F) was seeing a married guy for a few years.


We are dating for 9 months now, and have been acquaintances / friends for 3 years.


I come from a background where family is super important and we are all very close and have healthy and supportive relationships. My family has met my girlfriend and they love her.


What I didn't know was a detail from her past that was deeply integrated in her daily life. She wasn't just casually having sex with a married guy, they were basically together. At one point they lived together 5 days a week, they went on multiple holidays a year together. I even saw an insurance contract that in case he dies, she gets bunch of money. He has a wife and two kids btw.


I'm just so confused. It never even crossed my mind that she had secret life in these 3 years I have known her. I found it weird that she was single for so long and turned down men left and right and all of my male friends would talk about it, but no one knew way (it wasn't our place to know anyway).


Now I'm here. Just this morning my sister commented how cheaters are the biggest scums. Where to go from here?


Tl;dr: my girlfriend was seeing married guy for a few years. I'm not sure how I feel about any of this.


Sorry for mistake, English isn't my first language."
"I (18f) was hurt pretty badly yesterday by a kid (4-5?F) at my dance studio. I want to bring it up to her parents (??M and ??F) but I'm not sure how


I had to stay at my dance studio for a while yesterday, due to my ride being delayed. These two instructors (they're married, I'm not sure their ages to be honest) usually have their daughter at their studio. I'd say she's fourish? I don't really interact with kids, so I'm not entirely sure.


About ten minutes before my ride got there, she got bored and came up to me. I kind of just acknowledged her, because I wasn't sure what to do. She grabbed my arm and pulled it down to her level, and I didn't do much because I had no idea what she was doing. But she wrapped her arms around my upperarm, then swung up and wrapped her legs around my forearm.


It yanked me out of my chair, and sent us both falling. I had to twist so I wouldn't land on her, and I landed with all my weight on my knee. If I had tried to twist any further, I would have hit my head on a counter. I rolled a little bit, and hit my hip, then caught myself with my hands. She just laughed even though I was curled up clutching my knee. Even my back hurts from how I twisted when I hit the ground.


No one saw this (I'm not sure how, it was loud as hell). And I left about ten minutes later. But I have a massive bruise on my knee, and it still hurts, and my wrists hurt from trying to catch myself.


I'm going to be going to a party at the dance studio tonight, and her parents are going to be there. I want to tell them, but I'm not really sure how. I don't want to sound accusing, more give them a heads up. What I'm worried about is this:


1. She almost got hurt. If I didn't twist I would have landed on her, and probably crushed her.


2. Most of the people at the dance studio are elderly (60-70+) I'm lucky that I'm young and can take a fall. But if she did that to, pretty much, anyone else, they could have ended up badly hurt, even broken something. I, honestly, thought for a moment that I fractured or broke something from how hard I hit the ground, and how bad it hurts. 


What makes me worry the most, however, is that about fifteen minutes before that, she was playing with one of the students there. This lady is 75+, and super sweet. They were playing with her toy horses, but what if she'd done that to her? And normally she hangs out with my grandma, but she wasn't there that day. What if she had done that to her?


I don't really know her parents well. I've had two lessons with her mom, but none with her dad. But her dad has always been really nice to me, and so I'm not sure who to approach with it. I'm also really not sure how to address it. Can anyone help me? Give me pointers/a script/starters/anything? I don't want to accuse them, or make them feel bad, but I'm really worried she's going to hurt one of the other students.


**TL;DR:** A little girl at my dance studio hurt me pretty badly. I'm terrified she's going to hurt someone else. How do I talk to her parents?"
"We had to cancel our vacation plans and husband (34M) is blaming me (34F) for money we lost


I had planned a weekend vacation with my siblings, their spouses, my nephew and my parents back in January. One of my siblings lives out of the state so we don’t see each other much and I thought it would be nice to all get together. My husband and I have been married 4 years and have a 19 month old. 

My husband was on board with this when I booked it and agreed with me that booking a large condo for us at the resort we were staying at for us and my siblings and their family would make the most financial sense. My parents then got their own room to give us all space. The agreement then was to divide the cost of the condo between the three of us which came out to about $600 each. 

Unfortunately our 19 month old got sick the day before we were set to leave. It was nothing severe but my husband and I both decided going on vacation with him having a fever was not the wisest move. Especially since we didn’t want him to get my young nephew sick staying in the same place. This was a joint agreement to not go and frankly the amount my husband was complaining about going leading up to it, I think he was happy to cancel.

My siblings never once asked me to cover our share, and I knew that they wouldn’t. But I felt we all had an agreement to pay a certain share for our accommodations and as unfortunate as it was that we couldn’t go, I did not feel right making them cover the whole amount between two of them. I did try to get a smaller condo for them since they didn’t need all the space but the resort was unsurprisingly fully booked. And my parents would have lost money if they canceled their room and took my place in the condo. So, I offered to pay, which my husband agreed with before I offered. As a side note, I also make a lot more money than my siblings. Having to cover the extra $300 each on their side while doable for each of them is still not chump change. It also played into my deciding to offer. 

My husband though won’t let it go. He won’t stop complaining about having to pay when we didn’t go and blaming me for booking the trip in the first place. I booked this in January. Not like I could foresee our toddler getting sick. He keeps telling me how I learned an expensive lesson and I shouldn’t book anything for vacation again. He thinks we should just decide to go somewhere at a certain moment and then try to book something for that day. I think that’s absurd and a good way to never take a trip since most things book up. 

I’m getting beyond fed up. One: we can afford the $600 easily. I’m not saying I enjoy paying it but it’s not going to hurt us financially and was the right thing to do in my eyes. Two: he complains all the time that I work too much and we never go anywhere for vacations but never makes an effort to book anything himself. So I take the initiative and book something and he complains the month leading up to it and now complains we didn’t go. Yes, it was a vacation with my family, but the plan was for us to do our own thing most of the time.  Three: he’s still complaining he didn’t get a vacation despite going on a weekend trip with his friends about a month ago. 

Am I in the wrong here offering to pay our share for the condo? Is he right you should never book anything with a toddler because that seems absurd to me?

Tl:dr husband complaining that we paid our share of room for vacation we had to cancel at last minute. "
"I [26F] am getting fed up with my husband [29F] when it comes to meal planning


Hi, I will try to keep this as short as possible. So. I am responsible for 100% of the cooking in this relationship. When we started dating 6 years ago, the most challenging thing he could make was ramen noodles. He has no knack for cooking and that is a-okay with me. I do not mind at all that I cook all of the time. I enjoy cooking and feel good when others appreciate my food. I think I'm pretty good at it, too.

My problem is that I no longer feel that he appreciates my food. It's become a constant frustration. I will ask him what he wants to eat, he will either say, ""I don't know, whatever"", or ""I like everything you make"", OR and this one really chaps my ass, ""surprise me"". 

The thing is though, since he's of no help, I stick to his favorite recipes, the ones I've mastered, but he'll tell me, after I've already cooked, after I asked him that day and he gave me a non answer, that he wasn't in the mood for that, or we eat that too much lately. 

It's extremely aggravating, especially since we have been going through a hard time financially. We qualify for food assistance, but my husband absolutely refuses. He was furious at me for even mentioning it. I never brought it up again. We don't have a big food budget, so I'm really limited at what I can make. 

I pack him lunches to save money. I went to the store yesterday. My old car was repossessed, so I had to buy a questionable replacement off of Craigslist. It leaks fluids quite a bit. I was buying oil and antifreeze, altogether maybe $25 at the most. I tried to use our debit card, but it said insufficient funds. We should have had enough. I had no cash, no credit cards. I checked our balance on my phone and the transaction history. I saw that my husband has been going to various fastfood places every day, spending between $5 and $10 each time. 

I really felt blue putting that stuff back on the shelf. He's spent around $200 this month on fast food... that's more than double our food budget. I went home and cried my eyes out until he came home. He asked me what was wrong and I knew I wasn't in the proper state of mind to have a discussion, so I told him we could discuss it later after I have had time to calm down. He got pissy about that and said it was fucked up that I would make him wait to talk about it because now he'll worry and freak out.

Okay, fine. So I confronted him about the fastfood and how there wasn't enough money in our account for me to put fluids in my car. He said he'd ask his mom for money and acted like that was it, and of discussion. Yeah, no. 

I said I don't like borrowing money, not from his mom, not from anyone and that we would have had plenty of money if he hadn't been eating out every day. Then he got even pissier, asking me why I always want to fight when he gets home and that the issue, needing money for the fluids, was solved by him asking his mom and accused me of just wanting to fight, and then stormed off.

I don't get it. He has no problem taking handouts from his mommy, but God forbid we go on government assistance. How do I talk to him about this? We're both very stressed from all of this. It gets me blue, but he gets mad. 

I want to work things out, but I don't feel like we're on the same page anymore. How do I make things work?

TLDR My husband of 3 years and I have been going through a rough time financially. Our food budget is small and he is no help when it comes to meal planning, then he'll say he doesn't like what I chose to make. I've been making him lunches to save money and I found out he has been eating out every day. We absolutely cannot afford that and I was unable to buy much needed fluids for my car. "
"My [18F] father [48M] is scaring me out of driving. Is driving as hard as my father is making it out to be?


My father did not want me driving at 15/16 because he felt like I wasn't old enough or mature enough yet to start driving. Whenever I asked him if he could teach me how to drive, he'll say, ""No I don't think you're ready."" So I didn't do it.

""He tells me driving isn't that easy. People die everyday from it. He says driving a car is like driving a bomb. You have to be focused, and you have to constantly pay attention."" He makes me nervous when he says all these things.

He also says, ""If you're scared to drive it's not for you. Don't get behind the wheel if you're afraid."" This makes me upset because I am nervous to learn how to drive. He also says, ""Driving is a privilege not a right. If you don't think it's for you, don't do it.""

To this day my father is still very reluctant to teach me how to drive.  He tells me it's not easy, it's dangerous, etc, etc. This makes me more reluctant to do it.

However, I really want to learn because it's a big handicap not being able to drive. Most people where I live drive Automatics. I heard that Automatics are easier to drive than Manuals.

Is driving as hard as my father says it is?

tl;dr: My father is making me nervous to learn how to drive. He tells me it's not that easy, it's dangerous, etc. He was always reluctant to teach me because he always felt like I wasn't ready. He always tells me it's a big responsibility, people die everyday from it, accidents, etc. Is driving as difficult as my father is making it out to be?

"I (26F) moved to Vietnam with my boyfriend (32M) of now 15 months to teach English short-term. Now he doesn’t want to go home.


This is gunna be a long one, so buckle up. 



We dated for 5 months before we left. We travelled independently for a bit after we left Canada, and then moved in together in South Vietnam to teach English. Shit started getting not great when we moved in together. I’ve been super depressed being away from my support network in Canada. I leaned on him a lot (and generally just need a lot of physical affection from romantic partners) and he’s a super independent person. 

First we were going to be here for 6 months. Then a year. Then he said he might want 2-3 to get some money under our belts before we went home. I accepted this, although it was a major sacrifice on my part being away from my family for so long. 

We don’t have much in terms of a social life here so basically we settled into old married couple status super fast. I realized that a lot of my melt downs with him were due to my depression and not so much his actions, and vowed to myself that I was gunna just chill tf out. 

I went on a short trip to Hoi An without him for a few days. I thought it would be good to get some time away, hit the reset button, and then things would get better. Basically as soon as I walked in the door he said “we need to talk”. He told me that, because of the economy at home, and his debt, he’s not planning to go home to Canada in the foreseeable future. 

This was 5 days ago. We didn’t break up. We still sleep in the same bed. We’ve had sex a couple times (which is honestly an improvement from where we were before) and he still kisses me goodbye and whatever. But apart from that we’re tiptoeing around each other. 

I can’t tell me parents. They’re coming to visit us and stay with us at the end of September. I don’t want things to be weird, and I don’t want them to worry about me, since this has already been super difficult for them. 

I’m planning on staying in Vietnam for another year for money and experience. I just have no idea where to go from here. I’ve never lived on my own before. I thought I was going to marry this guy. Do I wait it out and hope he changes his mind? Stay living with him and then part ways when I’m ready to leave the country? Do I move out now and leave VN when I’m ready? Do I just fuck off and go home now? I feel like I can’t tell any of my friends because there’s so much pressure for me to go back home, and he was the whole reason I left in the first place. 

I’m sorry this is so jumbled, I just don’t have anyone to talk to right now. 

**tl;dr moved to Vietnam with a guy and now he says he doesn’t want to go home**"
"My (70’sf)Mother is furious about my (31f) wedding.


Let me start by saying I am extremely close with my mother. I live 3k miles from her and I call her everyday on my commute to talk.  After being engaged for a year with no planning done on our wedding, my fiancé and I decided to do a quick destination wedding that will also serve as our honeymoon. We broached the topic with both of our sets of parents 2 or3 months ago. My parents said they wanted me to have a wedding in our country so that they can drive. I said I did not want that, but would pay for everything (hotels house sitting etc ) if they would like to come. They seemed on the fence about it but not upset. My SO’s parents are on board. We let them know that if my parents could not come that we would like to do this on our own, as it seems unfair to have one set of parents present without the other. They understand and agree. 

We finally booked flights and hotel and made wedding arrangements last week.  I was so excited!  I called my mom to tell her and she started screaming and crying. She says she cannot believe I would exclude my brothers (?) from the wedding and that I will be upset when I get there and my family isn’t around. I’m very close with my family and have spoken to each brother about my plan and they don’t seem interested in any of it, since they’re boys.  I told her if she isn’t coming we will be eloping with no guests at all and that is ok with us. Honestly we are just trying to get married to get it over with and prepare for children.  We have lived together for years.  I’m the only girl in my family but I have never had a dream wedding. I just want to skip to the part where we are married. My mother listed all the places that we could get married in our country and I said that I did not want that. I don’t want a big wedding. I don’t want to spend my money trying to impress/feed other people since that what I think weddings are. She offered to pay for a wedding where I live and I declined. I live in a very high cost of living area and even a wedding for my immediate family would cost upwards of 25 k. I asked her to come and she screamed “ I’m not going” several times until I hung up.  She called back and yelled that I don’t want her there because of how she looks and that my fiancé has no idea what it is like to have a family, neither of which are true. I said I understand that they can’t come, and that we will be getting married alone. After a few more minutes of yelling I hung up again. I haven’t spoken to her in 3 days and it’s killing me. My SO says to not talk to her until she calms down and calls me but I want some other advice, since I really want to talk to her.

**Tl;dr. My mother is mad about my wedding ,unsure how to proceed**"
"My (22/f) aunt (57/f) is pretending to be me and catfishing her coworker’s son.


I want to preface this by saying that my aunt and I have never had the best relationship. She is a very controlling woman and thinks she knows what is best/right for me all the time. She doesn’t see me as an autonomous person, but as a thing that she can control. 

So my aunt is not a huge fan of my boyfriend. She has never met him. She knows nothing about him, other than that he is an engineer. She’s seen only one photo of him. My aunt took it upon herself three months ago to try to set me up with her coworker’s son. She sent me pictures of him and told me that she’s been taking to him about me and that he is very interested. 

For weeks, we went back and forth. Me telling her that I’m in a relationship and not interested in anyone else. Her telling me to give him a chance. Eventually, she gave in and agreed to stop leading him on and drop it. Fast forward to this morning, about two months later. I receive a text message from an unfamiliar number asking if this is HolyThrowawayyBatman. I ask who I’m speaking to and they tell me they are Henry (made up name for anonymity’s sake), the guy my aunt had tried setting me up with. At first, I think it’s my aunt who gave him my number and I’m getting ready to apologize and let him know that I am not actually interested....and then they say that they’ve been suspicious for quite some time now that they were being catfished by someone pretending to be me and looked up my information until they found my number via my Facebook account. 

As it turns out, they *were* being catfished. They sent me screenshots of a conversation they had been having with the person pretending to be me, and I knew right away that it was my aunt. For MONTHS, my aunt had been pretending to be me and leading this guy on. Every time he would ask to hang out, she would make up excuses like “my brother was in a biking accident”, “my mom is sick and needs me to take care of her”, etc, etc. 

I am so ashamed and disgusted and embarrassed. I confronted my aunt about this and she said that she was only trying to help me by finding me a boyfriend that “doesn’t drink and party” (my current boyfriend does neither). She lied to this poor man for months, letting him think that he was talking to me and that I was in love with him. 

I don’t know what to do about any of this. I don’t know what to tell this guy. I don’t know how to deal with my aunt. She doesn’t seem to understand just how disrespectful her actions were. 

Tl;dr: my aunt is trying to get me to break up with my boyfriend by pretending to be me and catfishing other men. "
"Partner [10 years married 3] (38M) wants me (33F) to stop salsa and bachata


 Hi r/ relationships

 Apologies in advance for terrible spelling and grammar. I posted this to salsa dancing but had to slightly amend for this sub. This is also this is quite long. 

I've been married for 3 years and we have a 15 month old. We have been together for over 10 years.

When we dated earlier on and had a big break up when i started salsa and fell in love it. I was quite young then so when we got back together, although he tried a couple of classes with me, he didn't feel the same. I did some more classes off and on but then i eventually stopped going. I thought why would i keep this up if my partner won't even dance the dance with me. At the time i only did the classes and didn't feel confident enough to stay and do social dancing.

Not continuing was always something i regretted. I get really sad when i hear salsa and bachata music as the music transports me to another place and also reminds me i didn't continue to learn the dance.

The first 10 months of having the baby was tough as I just stayed at home, finding it very hard to leave the house and organizing things to bring for the baby if i did take the baby out.

My partner also still continued his social life going out to friends places drinking and coming home late. In essence, although he is a great father, having a baby didn't have a major impact to him as he did to me.  There were times when he came home at 3 to 5 am in the morning from drinking at his friends place. I was home with my baby alone on New Years eve as i did not want to bring the baby out late and i knew he would want to stay out. there are many functions i would not go to as i don't like to drive home alone with the baby and know that my partner would not like to leave the event early with us.

My partner did not do anything different and continued his exercise regime even picking up an extra activity. There was one stage were he had something on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and was about to pick up an extra thing on Wednesday when i finally put my foot down. Tuesday and Thursdays are now my time to do what i want whether it be catch up with friends or an activity.

I was ready to finally do something that was for me again and didn't want to do a gym activity.

I wanted to do salsa primarily again. So i started going. The classes i went to was in a night club. The classes ran both salsa and bachata. My partner did say ""I don't know if i feel ok with this"" but I said i really want to do this, not the gym. It will make me find me again.

I've started to feel so great'again and happy that ive picked up this ''hobby'' . i felt a sense of annoyance that i let myself drop this as i could of been a lot better from the last 4 years if i continued on but i was determine to make up for lost time.

I've only gone to classes for 6 times and the last two classes I started going home later as i began social dancing which was so much fun and i could understand that this was what i did wrong earlier on when i started to dance.

This week i came home just after midnight and my partner was pretty annoyed with me. He asked why i was out so late and i said i was social dancing. The music after the class finished also didn't start so we were waiting around for 20 minutes to get some dancing in.

Two days later, i decided after watching many you tube videos and googling classes in the area that I wanted to pick up some more specific bachata classes to really clean my basics and do it properly. I asked my partner if he would be home from work early enough so i could see if i could do it on the day the class would be held. He was angry that it was bachata' and said he thinks i should """"calm down a bit"". It was a no nonsense - No that is enough discussion close - kind of response in a loud angry tone.

i feel like this is happening again (stopping classes) and i will regret this. i know i will.

i tried to talk to him again later on so that he would understand if i was to drop this - this is a big thing as i just reignited my passion again.

i feel like i am in mourning/grieving.  He said why can't it be enough for me when he said 'he wasn't comfortable with this'.

His view is that 

* he isn't comfortable with me 'grinding'on other men and 
* he won't look after our baby when im out doing these dance blocks dancing with strangers.
*  he said ive gone from doing classes to doing these big dance sessions.
* he says that he doesn't want to invite things to happen into our lives.
* what is going to happen in two years

I've tried to talk to him and explain  that yes while there is maybe some sleazy guys. Primarily everyone just loves dancing and wants to practice.

He said would i be okay if on other foot and i said absolutely. i would be more than happy if he came with me. there are married couples and couples that go separately. and then he justified it by saying Im not talking about those people. i'm talking about us.

I've also explained that bachata isn't really that close as he thinks it is more knee to knee at this learning stage and perhaps a hair comb which is done in salsa anyway. He got angry again and said that he has seen his friends do it and it is close!

i feel like he has punched me in the gut when he said ""í dont know why we stopped dancing before (when we did try the classes) and  now its too hard because we have a baby.  We stopped because he didn't like it and it was a chore for him. 

 i have tried to compromise and said - okay when we are closer to our parents (as we are moving in 8 months) - will he do classes with me then as i would love that he come with me or is this just something to say to appease me for now. 

 he then said - ïf i really want to do it - (like again it was a chore not because he wanted to). but he doesn't know how he will respond and doesn't think he can handle seeing me dance with another guy. he said what if he was dancing with another girl and i said - yes if it was salsa/bachata setting as oppose to a club, i will be fine with it as it is the dance. He still thinks that we are inviting something sinister into our lives. He said that he is feeling really insecure (which I was pretty surprise he would feel that let alone say that).

I dont know what to do. i just feel like im in mourning and im making the same mistake again. I said this to him and he said Ï told you from the beginning that i wans't comfortable with this. Basically - its my fault for lighting the flame when he told me he wasn't comfortable with me going .

 He is usually so trusting as he is always fine with me going out dancing with my girlfriends until the early morning. His close family member almost cheated on her husband 4 months back and that really floored my husband so i know this may has also made him extra insecure.

 i do recognize that a lot of partners would not be comfortable with there partners dancing but thats why i was feeling so great and balanced as i had a trusting husband who let me do something i really loved.

If i was to give us salsa/bachata again i want him to recognize what a big sacrifice this was and not a done deal because he said so. His logic is why am i giving this up for him and not for myself and our family as i am now a wife and mother.

i don't want to be a cliche and say if something was to happen with the relationship in the future, kick myself and know that i didn't continue to dance salsa and bachata for someone. 

I guess my question after the long rant (thank you for reading)  is - is it fair enough for my husband to ask me me to stop doing salsa and bachata?

Is there a way for me to feel more better about giving it up and being resentful? Not by taking another hobby - but having my husband recognize that this is a big deal.

Thank you Redit

**TL:DR**

I**n relationship for 13 years+. stopped dancing early on for relationship and have always regretted it. Started again after having a baby but husband wants me to stop. feel like i am in mourning or grieving this part of me as it really gave me back my spark and made me feel like an individual and not a wife or a mother.**"
"I (19F) wonder if my mom (50F) and brother (24M) relationship is weird


I spent part of this summer at home with my mom and brother, and part working. I'm going into my second year of college in a week. My school is pretty far away so this was my first time coming home since I left for college.

While being here I noticed it seemed my brother acts really childish especially with my mom. She does a lot of things to take care of him that you'd think any adult could do like heat up his own food and take a shower. 

She does his laundry, doesn't insist he get a job or take classes, he doesn't have friends or leave the house, he lives at home only interacting with her and watching TV. She does everything for him. I don't think he knows how to use the oven. I asked him to put a pizza in there because I was running late and my mom snapped at me saying he'd burn himself?? But she doesn't think I'll burn myself and expects me to still do my own laundry and everything. As I should, I'm not complaining I'm saying she sees us different. She acts like he'll get hurt doing basic things.

So he doesn't do any chores or anything and has no interest in learning. He basically just from what I see watches TV, talks with my mom, plays videogames. They read out loud to each other. She likes romance novels and he reads aloud from them even when there's graphic sex scenes, it's kind of awkward. The books she reads to him are things like what a 10 year old would read, chapter books. They say it's for the nostalgia. I think it's weird, why does he want to read kid books again.

They're also reeeeeally touchy. Lots of massaging and cuddling and kissing. They always cuddle on the couch, one time my brother sat down on the end of the couch while she was at the other end and she literally pouted and made a whining sound like a child, motioning for him to move closer, then he scooched over and put his head on her chest while she held him and idkkkk it was just really weird to me. She babytalks to him sometimes calling him things like baby boy and nuzzle bunny. I've overheard him calling her gorgeous. He also said her recent boob job looks amazing which was weird to me. He still sleeps in her bed too, sometimes if I wake up early and am in the kitchen I'd see him come out of my mom's room instead of his. I asked and he said she gets lonely.

I've asked him if he has any plans for moving out. He said he doesn't even know where to start. I said he should start by looking for an entry level job somewhere in town to build some savings. I showed him some example postings I easily found. He didn't know what an application was... he thought he could just go start working at any of them. When I explained it, he got panicked and started crying. He said it was too overwhelming to think about so he didn't want to talk about it anymore. Then buried himself in a videogame for the rest of the night. This was really worrying to me, how is he ever going to live independently if he can't fill out a job application form? 

He acts like he's just fine living here but how can that be? He has NO friends. Never dated anyone. I think he truly sees no one but my mom for weeks, maybe months on end. 

He's anxious by the very idea of leaving the house. I suggested we go get ice cream once (me driving, my mom won't let him try for his license) but he refused saying mom could get it from the store. He got really insistent that he didn't want to come with me. I've counted only three times he's gone outside the entire time I've been here. Twice was just to the end of the driveway to get the mail. The other was to grab a shirt off the wash line.

We share a bathroom when I'm here, but since I left for college he's kind of taken it over so it's mostly his stuff in there now. When I got here I was putting some of my things in a cabinet under the sink and I found adult sized diapers among his stuff. I don't want to believe that he's childish (or lazy??) to the point he wears diapers to bed so he doesn't have to get up to pee, but who knows anymore.

Before you ask, yes, he's kind of always been like this. Not THIS bad but it's probably especially standing out the older he gets. Also me being away I see what people my age are capable of, so people his age definitely should be.

For a little more background on him he never went to college. My mom encouraged me in my applying a couple years ago and even went with me to check out a couple schools. On the contrary she didn't care about my brother's education at all. I was only in middle school when he would have been applying but I remember they never talked about it. She never brought it up. Then eventually it just became known he didn't want to go and that was just accepted. I waffled a bit at first not knowing if I wanted to take classes locally for a bit at the CC. As soon as I said this my mom immediately shut it down, encouraged me to apply to traditional 4 year schools and helped me. I remember her pushing me not to slack off my final semester or they could take back my acceptance. She was kind of on my ass to be honest. I was never going to slack off, I wanted to go to college. With my brother it's like she just didn't give a shit. I don't think it's done him any favors. Now he has no motivation about anything.

He has a lot of immature mannerisms and attitudes so honestly I don't know if he could get a job even if he wanted to. I'm talking like whiny voice if he doesn't get something he wants, giggling like a little kid, tantrums and outbursts at minor inconvenience (zipper on his jacket got stuck and he yanked it so hard it broke off, then threw the jacket across the room, lots of stuff like that.) Like, what's he gonna do if something goes wrong at work?

When I'd tell him stuff from college he got sort of curious and said a few times that he wishes he could do the things I do. Then followed it up with ""but I can't leave mom."" I pushed him to explain why. She's not disabled or unemployed. He said she ""needs him."" I don't get it.

Part of me wonders if I'm oversensitive to all of this because I'm just jealous. My mom has never mistreated me but I feel like he is her favorite. She's stricter and more detached with me. Not saying I want her lying on top of me on the couch too, just that it would be nice if she hugged me once in a while. 

Idkkk am I overreacting to think my brother is too dependent on her? I love him and want the best for him. I don't think this is it.

TL;DR: My older brother has some childish tendencies, encouraged by our mother. He's very naive about what adult life involves. Our mom does everything for him. He rarely leaves the house and doesn't have any friends."
"28F looking around and realizing boyfriend (30M) has stripped me of who I was before I met him


It’s been 2 and a half years. I was perfectly content and happy being single. I thought I had chosen to stop being single for the right one, the one who made me feel loved and wanted and happy.

I’ve known for a bit now that I need to get out, but circumstances keep reeling me back in.

I look around at my life and find that I’ve lost almost all of my people because he didn’t like them, didn’t approve of them because they were different than his type of friends, or because I know that I’ll get in trouble if I spend time with them.

2 and a half years of catering to his needs, going into debt because I went back to school to get a better career because he didn’t like what I did for work and still only make a fraction of what he makes but he doesn’t want to compromise on bills, getting criticized for the way I do things.

I’m so worn down, and tired of watching my step because even something as simple as spending time my family for more than an hour is bad in his eyes which in turn causes him to retaliate and try to make me feel bad or say extremely hurtful things.

My coworker asked me today what I had planned for the weekend. Absolutely nothing. There’s no one that I can spend time with that I won’t get “in trouble” for, including my best friend of over 10 years.

I feel lost and sad. I never expected to be the type who goes from outgoing and happy to introverted and lonely.

TLDR: Boyfriend has taken over my life by criticising everything and everyone and limiting who I can spend time with, and I’ve stopped and looked around to see that who I was before is gone."
"BF (25m) of 1.5 yrs seems bored with my (23f) attempts at improving sex life


tl;dr - Boyfriend seems bored with my attempts at reviving our sex life and I’m acutely embarrassed that I even tried. 

I know it’s a weird time to post, I just can’t sleep well. I guess the honeymoon period is over. We used to have sex all the time, send sexy texts and pictures. 

We haven’t had sex in maybe two weeks. We both have stressful jobs. I sat him down Thursday evening and expressed my concerns and asked if we could plan for sex Friday night. He said that sounds great. 

Friday while we were both at work, I used my lunch break to stop by the house for a snack and ended up sending him some quick nudes (mostly ass shots) to send him because I was excited by the anticipation. 

His texts in response:

Him: “yep, that’s what it looks like”

(Five minutes pass because I don’t know what to say.)

Him: “i guess i’m putting my dick in that later”

In the past he’d actually express some excitement or something complimentary. I was so embarrassed about the pictures and my absolute failure at being sexy that I ended up not wanting to have sex. He had kind of an eye-rolling, exasperated attitude that I didn’t want to anymore, like I was being high-maintenance. 

My body hasn’t changed since we met. It’s the same one he claimed to love at first. 

Am I overreacting? I know not to send nudes anymore, but I don’t know how to revive our sex life. Any advice is appreciated. "
"I (21/f) was disowned by my mother for taking a job across the country, now I can’t see my father after his heart attack. My family is now trying to sabotage my relationship with my boyfriend. UPDATE.


Hi guys, this is an update to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/97qaij/my_21f_mother_cut_contact_with_me_after_i_moved/?st=JKZQWLNW&amp;sh=5c77eff7

I ended up cutting my trip to CA with my mom’s sister short. I bought a ticket to visit my father across the country and no one was happy with this decision. My aunt essentially disowned me, told me I was selfish, and was a “f*cking b*tch”. 

I made a stop at my house to pick up my boyfriend, who was going to be joining me on my trip to my father for emotional support. When I got there, my bf shared with me a message my aunt had sent him via Instagram, saying that I was a disgusting person, a liar, homeless, and would ruin his life. She was basically trying to sabotage our relationship. He doesn’t believe a word she said, but I feel terrible that he is now being dragged into this mess. 

What do I do? I don’t want to contact her and fuel another argument? Should I drop my attempt to see my dad and completely remove this family from my life? I don’t want my family dragging the one non toxic relationship I have through the mud. 

Tl;dr: disowned by my mother for taking a job across the country, now I can’t see my father after his heart attack. My mother’s family is now trying to sabotage my relationship with my boyfriend for revenge. "
"[UPDATE]I [19M] just got kicked out of my girlfriend’s [18F] parents place and I don’t know what to do now.

"I just found out that my[27f] bf [27m] of three months is trying to work on his friendship with his ex and invited her to come visit. She does not know about me and he is scared to tell her that he is dating me. I gave him an ultimatum to tell her and now she’s upset at him and won’t come to visit.



Long post:  

We met on a dating app. He told me that he “broke up” with his ex when he moved to our city a year ago. He told me that he was ready to date and everything was going well. We started hanging out and grew really close. Everything was going well. I started to notice text messages a few weeks from his ex. I only know her name because she’s still on one of his social media posts. He told me that she was manipulative and that he didn’t want to date her but they were still friends. I’m ok with being friends with exes and I’m definitely not jealous of her. I only distrust people if they give me a reason to distrust them. So I finally approached him about it when I saw a message  from her while sitting next to him. Last week he told me that a friend from the city he moved from was coming to visit. I asked him (because part of me suspected it was her) who the friend was. He had no problem telling me it was his ex and that they are trying to work on their friendship. At that point I was upset but not that upset because he’s never given me a reason to think he wanted to get back together with her. THIS IS WHEN THINGS CHANGED: I asked him if I could meet her when she visited. He said no. I asked why. He said it would be too soon and she might get upset. I asked why she would be upset and if she knew about me, his new gf. He told me that she didn’t know and that it might deter her from visiting and that she would feel like she was “being replaced”. I told him that she was being replaced I am his gf and we are in a committed relationship. I did not get upset but I walked out and told him if he wanted to keep this relationship he would need to be honest with her before she came. I don’t even care that she’s coming it’s the fact that I know she’s not over him and that he basically kept their relationship a lie. He doesn’t view it this way but I think he’s stupid to think she doesn’t want to get back together with him. I gave him and ultimatum that if he wanted to stay together with me he would need to be honest with her to give her the opportunity to either come or not. He apologized to me briefly when we had this conversation in person yesterday. He said he would need to think about what he was going to say to her and that he was nervous she would not want to be his friend. Then I got this message: “I told her and she did not take it well”, “thanks a lot”, “it was is her birthday Sunday and I upset her”. I basically told him that I’m sorry I it didn’t work out but I would be stupid to keep him in my life. His response “I value our friendship and now I feel like I’ve lost that forever” my response, “you clearly don’t value ours and I can’t teach you how to”.

Not sure what to do now. I want us to be together but I feel like he’s completely messed this up. 

tl;dr; I started dating this guy a few months back. He lied to me about keeping a friendship with his ex (he broke up with her). Did not tell her about me and now she’s coming to visit. Tl;dr;"
"Three of my [22 F] boyfriend's [26 M] friends tried to get with me, immediately after hearing a false rumor that we were 'on a break'



I've been with Tommy for 4 years. 

Last week, we were at a party with a lot of his friends, and a few of my friends. My friend Lisa and I were talking, and I made some dumb pun-based joke about hooking up with a girl. Lisa made a joke about me and Tommy being on a break so I could go be lesbian for a while. (I didn't write the jokes out here because they wouldn't make sense out of context, but they were totally not serious.)

Though I didn't realize at the time, one of Tommy's friends overheard the tail end of that, and actually believed Tommy and I were on a break. And so that rumor went around. Within that night and next few days, a couple of Tommy's friends hit on me.

John was talking to me a lot at the party and being kinda flirty. I was confused, and just walked away to hang with my friends.

Alec started. to Snapchat message me, literally sending me cheesy pick up lines. I thought it was a joke and just said ""lol"" back

I was at the gym that Mark also goes to, and he kept giving me workout tips even though we rarely talked before, and asked me to hang out after. I said I already had plans because I did.

Alec shapchatted me again, starting a conversation that again came off as possibly flirty. He eventually mentioned the ""break"" and I was really confused. I asked him what he meant. He said ""Aren't you and Tommy on a 'break' because you've got to know breaks never work"" I said ""wtf no"" and asked him where he'd heard it. 

That was when I figured out that Tommy's friends thought we were on a break because of overhearing a silly conversation at the party. It all hit me at once, why they'd been acting so weird and ""friendly"" the last couple days. They thought we were separated and thought they could get in my pants. Somehow, none of them had thought to talk to him about it; they jumped right to trying to get with me??? 

I told Tommy everything, expecting him to be mad at his friends. But other than finding the misunderstanding funny he didn't seem too surprised. It almost seemed like he expected his friends to try to fuck his ""ex"", given the chance. That weirds me out so much; none of my friends would touch an friend's ex with a nine foot pole... I also am weirded out by continuing to hang out with the group, given my boyfriend's ""boys will be boys"" attitude about the whole situation.

Is all this as weird as it feels to me?

TLDR - My boyfriend's 3 close friends tried to hook up with me, after a false rumor about us being on a break went around. My boyfriend is bizarrely not bothered?

"My husband [29M] wants to get a MASSIVE tattoo in honor of his late teacher, I'm [28F] not so sure about it...


So a bit of background, my husband has been doing Jiu-Jitsu (A wrestling martial art) since he was around 16, he's dabbled around with other sports but this is the one he always came back to. He's currently a black belt and has competed in dozens of tournaments, both pro and amateur.  

In his late teens he was even sponsored and sent to Brazil to train, and trained for the good part of 2 years under one teacher, once he hit his twenties they both moved to the UK (the teacher for work, my husband for university) and they continued together, we met around that time and got married 4 years ago.  
Granted with work and marriage he didn't attend as much as before but I can tell he still loves the sport. A few weeks ago his teacher passed away, we both went to the funeral and I could tell he was grieving. 

.

Just yesterday he comes up to me and tells me he wants to get a tattoo, it's a surprise to me because he's never expressed a want for one but I would've been okay with it if it wasn't what it is; he wants the *exact* same one his teacher had.  
The issue with that is that it is absolutely **huge**, it covers his entire back and left arm! It's also got crazy eastern demons and fish all over it, hell he even got in contact with the family and got a picture of the design *and* the contact of the original artist in Brazil.  

I mean I understand the sentiment behind it but this is just crazy to me, I'm not sure I'd be able to look at his body the same way after if he gets it since I don't find tattoos attractive.   
Like if he compromised for something smaller I'd be okay but he's been real stubborn about it saying it won't hold the same weight or whatever.  
  
**TL;DR**: Husband is a martial artist, his teacher recently passed away and he's adamant to get the same exact massive tattoo covered in demons to honor him. I'm not sure how to handle this issue as he's grieving and respects him a lot"
"My [26M] brother [24M] will literarily use violence if I try to sell the guinea pigs he bought 3 months ago that he cast aside and doesn't even see them


I take care of them daily like they're my own children, I do it because the first few weeks they lived next to a mop in the basement and sometimes didn't eat or drink for days.

I cannot take care of these guys, I've been trying my best for 3 months and they're stressing me out, cleaning their cage full of shit daily that often involves me getting clawed and waking me up at night from them biting the cage.

One of them is trying to bang his mom and sister, so I bought a cage to separate the guy alone but he's become more depressed them ever, they're social animals I can't believe how he cast them aside like this.

It's always an instant no followed by aggression and threats whenever we try to sell them. He does not take care of them, doesn't even ever see them, they're in my room and I take care of the responsibility he just left to die.

He almost bought 2 cats last week and if it wasn't for our father getting involved they would've definitely ended up here.

I have no idea how to deal with him or this situation.

TL;DR: Brother bought and keeps trying to buy pets he never takes care of, pets could've been miserable or even reached a slow death if I didn't step in to care for them (this has happened with rabbits, a parrot and a dog just within 4 years). Brother will resort to violence if we try to sell them."
"My friend’s (28M) stance on monogamy is really frustrating. Is this none of my business?


To give some background. A friend of mine is very insistant that men are unable to stay loyal.

Despite having numerous friends who DO remain faithful - he insists that its okay to cheat on the stance ""what she doesnt know wont hurt her"" often citing his married male friends who are also serial cheaters as testament to the fact its acceptable and okay.

When he spoke to me recently about his new infidelity towards his new partner - which he claimed he regretted, i told him my honest thoughts on the subject. I told him if it was me I wouldnt be able to keep it a secret and the guilt would consume me. This really aggrevated him and we had a pretty heated arguement/discussion about the merits of loyalty and whether I have the right to judge someone for being unfaithful.

All the typical points were stressed about how relationships are trust etc. 

Ultimately he said he regretted what he did and wouldnt do it again. However, he has influences in other friends which I know he uses to justify his behaviour. It wouldnt be the first relationship he has ruined because he has been caught cheating or he felt so guilty he had to end his relationships in the past.

Basically, the repeat offenses have really soured my thoughts of him as a man and as a friend. Even though it has nothing to do with me.

Is this something I should look beyond and ignore or something i should confront him about?

**Tl;dr friend is a serial cheater. Is this none of my business? Do i have a right to call him out on it?**"
"My (36f) dream life with the love of my life (42m) was ruined in under 1 minute.


I'm so crushed. We've been together for 4 years.




He accepted a new job and we moved to our new city 6 weeks ago. We found the perfect house and just moved in 6 weeks ago and have been setting it up. We both love it.  We love our neighbourhood. Since we moved here, we've spend weekends walking around our new town, trying new restaurants, buying things for our home, painting, gardening. 






I don't have a job here yet and I looked into taking a program at the local college this fall.  We also bought a cat here.




2 nights ago, he went out after work with new colleagues. He used to have a problem with alcohol but for several years has basically abstained or severely limited it.  He ended up not coming home until after midnight (he didn't contact me while out) and when he did, a young woman drove him home.






I was angry because he was completely drunk and this young woman brought him home. Plus he hadn't stayed in contact with me to say he'd be that late. We had some heated words, and he suddenly just snapped (I honestly don't recall what made him snap but I know I didn't say anything outrageous). He lunged at me and grabbed me by the throat. He squeezed hard enough that I know have bruises on my neck. It only lasted a moment, then he stopped, muttered that I was an asshole and went to bed.








I'm crushed. Of course I realize I have to leave. I know choking is dangerous. He's never done this before. He apologized and is horrified that I'm bruised, but how could I possibly stay after this?  I look around at my house and my cat and my partner and I cry.





**tldr: partner snapped and choked me and now my life has crumbled before my eyes**"
"My (36F) husband (36M) of 6 years promised to try to lose weight but now wants to participate in a competitive eating contest.


My husband was slightly overweight when we got married. Since then his weight has steadily increased to the point he weighs nearly 350 pounds. There are a few factors for it including familial predisposition (both parents were obese...now they're dead), his job is sedentary, his hobbies are sedentary, and he eats out of boredom. He also eats a lot of unhealthy foods. So the classic pair of not enough exercise and too much unhealthy snacking.

He knows he has a problem, he knows he's dangerously overweight. He had a heart attack a year ago. Since then he's had to take medication to lower his cholesterol and blood pressure, and he's pre-diabetic. The doctor bluntly told him he's eating himself into an early grave and if he doesn't change his habits and lose weight, he could die before our child (1 year old) is in college. Not necessarily from the weight but the problems it causes. Diabetes issues or another heart attack, risky surgical procedures like triple bypass. 

This was a year ago and it happened right after I gave birth so it was extremely stressful. Something finally seemed to click for him and he said he was going to commit to losing weight. That lasted a few months. I was very proud of him in that time, but then Christmas season hit and he was overeating again, bingeing on sweets, and falling back into old habits. This continued even after the holiday season ended. He quickly gained back the pounds he'd lost, then gained more. He's made a couple half-hearted attempts to cut back on junk food but it never lasts more than a week.

So, a couple weeks ago, I had another come to Jesus talk with him repeating all the things his doctor had said following the heart attack, telling him *he has a family and we need him healthy.* Again, he seemed to have a sincere realization. He promised me he'd take his diet choices seriously and seek out a personal trainer to develop an appropriate exercise routine for weight loss. I suggested a weight loss support/therapy group, he was on board with that idea. It looked like he was going to turn things around.

It's been mixed results. He has cut back the junk food and *sometimes* moderates his portions. Other times, he still overeats. Finding the trainer and the support group haven't happened yet. I've reminded him and he's said either that he hasn't been able to find anything, or he's too busy that day and will do it the next day. I want to believe he'll follow through but I just do not know. 

He's still completely sedentary, doesn't leave the house except for work. Sits on the couch watching TV or on his computer until bed. He tries to play with our daughter but gets out of breath too easily so he never plays with her for long. He wants her to just lay on the couch with him, but she's started walking and doesn't want to sit still or be held for hours.

So I was already beginning to doubt that he's trying as much as he promised he would. 

Then, yesterday, he announces he's going to take part in a fucking dumpling-eating contest. Our area has a Taiwanese festival in a couple weeks and he's said before that he wants to enter that contest one year. 

I couldn't really believe what I was hearing. I asked so is this his way of saying he doesn't care anymore about losing weight? He says he sees it as his ""last hurrah"" before buckling down to change his diet. He insisted he wouldn't gain weight from ""just one meal."" He gave a bunch of other, frankly ridiculous justifications like that after he loses weight his stomach won't have as much capacity so he needs to do it now. Why does he ""NEED"" to do it at all?? The winner gets a free trip to Taiwan so he's telling me it's for the family, we could take our daughter to another country, blah blah blah! Well, no, we'd still be paying for her and myself which we can't afford and even if so, there's no way I'm putting a 1 year old on a plane for 20 hours of travel to the other side of the world. It's absolutely absurd.

I am so frustrated, I feel like a dam has broken and I'm finally feeling all the fear and anger over his attitude about his health. We've had so many conversations. I've begged, argued, cried, yelled, every time he says he understands and will work harder. It never, ever, lasts. And now this dumpling contest shit, it's like he's actively trying to sabotage himself. It's one thing to slip back into longtime ingrained habits, it's another to go out of your way seeking them out.

What the hell do I do to get through to him? I know that losing weight is hard work. It's discouraging at the beginning and not fun and takes a lot of willpower. But you'd think the least he could do is not do things that will make it WORSE like stuffing himself with dumplings in an eating competition!

I'm angry but underneath that I'm scared. His parents died of weight related problems in their 60s. I'm terrified he's on the same path. Apart from his health there are no issues in our relationship. I love him. I couldn't stand to lose him. To see him doing things that are completely against his self-interest is becoming unbearable. 

TL;DR: Despite continuous promises to eat better and lose weight, my very overweight husband intends to take part in a dumpling eating contest. We have a 1 year old child. I'm losing hope that he's going to be able to improve his health before it's too late."
"My [49F] husband [50M] is insisting on differential treatment between our twin children [18M &amp; 18F] and it's making my son resentful.


TLDR: My husband and I are providing my daughter, a medical student, with financial assistance to make her university life smoother. My husband refuses to provide my son, a commerce and law student, the same benefit as a successful commerce/law student is expected to engage in paid extracurricular activities.  


My children have always been expected to 'earn' the things they want. As children, this meant that they had to do chores to earn enough money to buy that toy they wanted. As teenagers, they were expected to be employed in a part-time capacity to supply their own spending money. That is not to say that we have not provided for our children. All their necessary expenses were covered, and they were given every opportunity to succeed in life. 

Last year, both my children got into their desired courses: my daughter followed in my foot steps and is now attending medical school, while my son followed in my husband's foot steps and is studying a double degree in law and commerce. I suggested to my husband that we supply our children with spending money while they studied at university so that they can focus entirely on their degree and enjoying the university experience. While my husband agreed in giving our daughter a monthly sum that would allow her to comfortably enjoy life as a student, he refused to provide to our son the same benefits.

His reasoning is that there are different expectations for a medical student compared to a com/law student. A medical student is expected to engage in non-paid extracurricular activities to bolster their resume. This makes holding a paid part time job, on top of all the responsibilities of a medical student, an unreasonable demand.  A com/law student, on the other hand, is expected to engage in paid extracurricular activities. Because of these differences, he argued that while it would be unreasonable to expect our daughter to maintain a part time job in conjunction with her responsibilities as a medical student, it is not only reasonable to expect that our son maintain a part time job but that his degree demanded it of him. Understandably, my son is not happy with this decision. Unfortunately, my husband is extremely stubborn and has refused to budge from his position.   


It is nearing a year since my husband has made that decision. My son refuses to acknowledge his father in any capacity despite living under the same roof. I'm fearing that my husband's principles might cause irreparable damage to his relationship with his son and I strongly wish he would make an exception just this once. How should I approach this issue, or is this something I should even involve myself in?"
"BF [21m] not handling me [22f] going to law school well


I'm gonna preface that I am a mix of exhausted, stressed out and generally overwhelmed. It's gonna be lengthy.

I've \[22F\] have been with my BF \[21M\] for over two and half years and for the most part the relationship has been rather low turbulence in comparison to my prior relationships. We met in my sophomore year of college and his freshman year when I was only a few months off a break up. I initially wanted nothing to do with him and was not willing to date what so ever. My breakup had been truly awful and I was just really starting to get on my feet. He persisted for about a month before I agreed to go on a break up.

For the majority of our relationship, he's been incredibly doting and supportive. But I would be lying to say if that doting didn't spiral into obsessiveness and clinginess. The majority of our fights have been over the fact that I need space, as I'm a fairly independent person. I didn't want to be together 24/7 and he really struggled with that once the honey moon phase was over. But eventually, he seemed to get better about it and it was tolerable.

As we've dated, I discovered that while he has a generous and kind heart, he can be incredibly immature. He can't manage to show up in a timely fashion for anything, can't keep a part time job and whines the moment he isn't entertained (i'm sure this is part of the current problem) for example. Just lots of little immature and generally exhausting things to deal with. Once again, he's made progress in the past that it reach a tolerable level.

He is also whole heartedly way too reliant on me. Stupid shit like ""Should I go grocery shopping right now or go to the gym?"" And i'm like, ""Why does my opinion matter? This isn't something I should have an opinion in."" Because it's really not. What would happen whenever I refused to answer is he just wouldn't do either option and just lay around all day. It's ridiculous, annoying and has been a constant problem in our relationship.

I will lend that the majority of my friends and family love him. He's super easy to get along with, is always willing to jump in and help, and fits in really well with my crowd. The general consensus is that he comes off a bit immature but he's always friendly and kind. My mom in particular is really fond of him, which makes this whole mess a bit frustrating.

Right now, I'm two weeks into Law School and the relationship seems to be self combusting.

I've been wanting to go to Law School for the past two years and I've been incredibly vocal and driven about this. It's non-negiotable to me that i'm going and that this is a priority to me. He has always been incredibly supportive and very, ""Whatever you need just let me know."" Sounds great, right? I had zero idea that this was going to be such an insane and rocky start.

I spend probably 6-8 hours a day just studying, reading and doing school related things where I am not checking my phone or social media. I just don't have time, brain cells or energy for it. When I go to school, I disable the wifi on my laptop and turn my phone off so that I can try to focus. I absolutely let him know that I was becoming less and less available out of sheer survival. I'm trying to make myself a future, I really am. Well this is absolutely not going well on his end. In a 36 hour period, he texted me ""What are you doing"" 17 times. 17 bloody times. I ended up face timing him and was like this is unreasonable, unhealthy and needs to stop immediately. He seemed to hear it but a few days later, he's back at texting me several times a day to ask what i'm doing.

Don't get me wrong - I *get* that I'm the one who change here.

I went from being available almost all the time, to basically not available at all. I get it. It sucks, i'm aware. I'm also changing as a person because I have to be more responsible, more mature and more scheduled then ever before. But i'm also being very very forthcoming about the fact that this is what I need to do to survive law school. I'm only a few weeks in and this is really hard and taking some adjusting. Every day I get a better handle on things, but i'm still adjusting to the learning curve of just the giant work load. I physically and mentally can't be more available to him then I am at this moment.

Plus, I just don't want to be.

Every time i've talked to him in the last 10 days we've gotten into a fight. Everything from a full blown fight to passive aggressive squabbles. It's reached the point that the moment he starts being passive aggressive, I just say I have to go and hang up. I'm so brain dead that staring at a wall and doing nothing is actually relieving, I don't have the energy to constantly fight with him and deal with passive aggressive comments. He's like, ""Why don't you FaceTime me more often?"" Because every time we talk, we fight or you harass me about when is the next time we are going to see each other. On that note, he is not in class this past week and wanted to know if he could come up and stay in my new apartment for my first week of law school. I said heck no. I genuinely am gone all day, i'm exhausted and I need to be making friends with my colleagues and adjusting to my new city and life.

This didn't settle well and he's asked probably every other time we've talked about when he can come visit. I genuinely can't even gather the free brain cells to think about what to have for dinner, let alone when I can squeeze in time for a visitor and the amount of pre-work I would have to do.

I guess what i'm failing to get at, is i'm trying to decide how long I should give him to adjust before I call it. Our relationship has problems naturally. I don't enjoy who I am around any more because the little things of his personality really get under my skin and it just makes me cranky. This is just becoming more and more irritated by law school and he's sorta combusting.

If you read this entire thing, thank you and you are wonderful person.

**tl:dr I went off to law school and became rather unavailable every day. Boyfriend, who was already clingy, is self combusting and picking fights.**"
"My [31M] mother [69F] wants to donate her retirement funds to a Buddhist organization


Hi Reddit, longterm lurker first time poster here. My parents are both retired, and comfortably so. We come from a frugal culture so they don’t spend a lot of money on themselves, generally my parents save for their children and their children’s education. However, in the last couple decades my mother has been spending more and more time with a Buddhist organization and becoming more Buddhist herself. Nobody in my family aside from my Catholic SIL is religious.

In the last couple years Mom has expressed a desire to donate the savings from her retirement accounts towards a Buddhism cause that will build Buddhist schools. Her reasoning is that our immediate family are relatively taken care for, there are no immediate financial issues, and she wants to see the money go towards something she believes in and can see the immediate results of. She admits that her wishes sound crazy but she wants to do it more than anything. Obviously my Dad is livid. He won’t even spend any money on himself in retirement, he’s still thinking about leaving his money for myself and my siblings and his grandchildren.

My take is that even if there are no immediate financial concerns, there are some over the horizon. My brother still has 400k to pay off his house for a family of four, and I don’t believe that he’s able to save a lot under his current conditions. My sister and I have no debt as far as I’m aware. We love our Mom very much — she is very kind and generous but recently she is more and more preoccupied with religion and less with her family.

More importantly, I’m really concerned with how obsessed she is with the idea. She’s only made small donations in the past AFAIK. The fact she wants to donate what I believe to be about half a million dollars in one lump sum to this group worries me. Why should religion demand her money but not just her time and energy? Why does she need to dump her money now, as opposed to having it in her Will contingent on certain conditions?

Why does it have to be all of her savings and not say 20%? I think the percentage of the donation has been her personal decision but I have no doubt the organization has been making a strong sell. My feelings on religion aside, I feel like as a family we should be able to compromise on a decision like this at least. I know that she wouldn’t approve of the decision if one of our SO’s wanted to do the same in a similar position.

Mom is very strong-willed, especially when it comes to disagreeing with our Dad or interventions, so coming on strong or Dad threatening divorce won’t help. I just want to come up with some ways we can discuss the issue without her outright dismissing them, such as compromise or reason. I don’t care if I never see a cent of this money, but this issue will cause a lot of drama in our family and I want to try and mediate. Is there some legal solution I can suggest, like agreeing to donate the money past a certain date based on my discretion? Has anyone been in a similar position with a loved one? Sorry for the long post and thank you for any suggestions or advice.

**TL;DR My retired mother wants to donate her 401K and pension savings towards building Buddhist schools because she wants to see her money do good in her lifetime and most of our family is comfortable financially. It’s creating a rift in the family and I’m trying to find ways to compromise or reason with her.**
