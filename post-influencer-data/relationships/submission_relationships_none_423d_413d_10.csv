"UPDATE - Someone stole from me [24F], how do I deal with the ""suspects""? Brother [27M], best friend [24M], GF [23F], housemate [28M] and housemate's GF [21F]


[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90zuvf/someone\_stole\_from\_me\_24f\_how\_do\_i\_deal\_with\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90zuvf/someone_stole_from_me_24f_how_do_i_deal_with_the/)

First off, thank you for the suggestions. I went with the idea u/lampshade00 offered. I took each person aside and told them that I was going to go to the police if the money wasn't returned. I told each person to put the money in a different spot.

About £100 was returned to the spot I told Kane to use. Kane took me aside and asked me not to be too harsh on Alessa, as she is only young. I played along and agreed. Later, I sent Alessa a text and asked her if she knew that Kane was pinning the theft on her. She hit the roof. She came to the house, and flipped out at Kane. Apparently, he told her that he'd seen Carrie taking it, and that everybody else was ganging up and blaming her. 

Kane apparently enjoys being the ""puppet master"". I could fill a book with the lies he's been telling the lot of us. His cloud cuckoo lander behaviour is more or less an act, the money was just sitting in his sock drawer (Alessa tore his room apart until she found the money, which she gave back to me). Kane just likes to see people fight. 

I'm moving out of Kane's place, and in with Daniel. Alessa has dumped Kane. I have my money back. Daniel was never that fazed, so he's forgiven me. Michael is hurt, and Carrie is just relieved that I didn't really think it was her. Probably going to spend this money on fun stuff to do with Daniel, Carrie and Michael to  smooth over the justifiably hurt feelings incurred.

TLDR: Kane stole the money to mess with people. I've got my money back. Thanks again."
"UPDATE: My (36F) husband (36M) caught lying about seeing another woman...


Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8tq98r/my_36f_husband_36m_caught_lying_about_seeing/

Here is what has happened since posting: 

- We’ve spent time apart, and time together. We had one great blowout. When I told him he needs to cancel his trip, he told me to “fuck off“ and “he needs to do this for himself“. I told him I plan to fuck off. Still denying seeing the woman this weekend.

-Miscellaneous shit: found a receipt thatincluded a new box of condoms, then found condoms. We don’t use condoms. He still talks to the other woman daily, and is currently helping her with her resume. 

-I told him I’m done, etc., and he’s looking for an apartment.

-He left for Denver this morning. He hugged me and tried to kiss me (?!) but it landed in my hair because I pulled the hell back.

-I am talking to lawyers next week- an immigration lawyer and a divorce lawyer.

-I am considering changing the locks this weekend while he’s off doing God knows what.

-The lies have continued (he didn’t buy those condoms!) , and the absolute disrespect has continued as expected. I’m still having moments of absolute heartbreak , and there are still some days I can’t get out of bed. I really really think he believes his own lies and genuinely sees nothing wrong with what he’s doing. 

I reread— daily— all of the comments and messages from my original post. I am so grateful for this community. You all —along with friends and family—have established a firm foundation under my feet.
I cannot thank you enough.

TL;dr:  Lies continued, left for Denver this morning, the woman he talks to daily is there, meeting with lawyers. THANK YOU."
"(UPDATE) Me [29F] with my sister [21F]; I feel like she's been an incredibly rude house guest.


Previous post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ydbk3/me_29f_with_my_sister_21f_i_feel_like_shes_been/

So my sister, Allie [F21] let my cat out last week, and I finally snapped at her about her careless behavior. I told her she needed to go stay with Sam, as had been her original plan. She avoided me for a few days and showed up last Friday with our other sister Sam [F20] to pick up some things Sam left at my house and Allie's luggage. They were both really rude to my husband about the whole situation. When confronted about my jewelry, Allie said she'd forgotten to bring it with her. (Yeah, right.)

So this weekend I ask Allie to return it, again and again. She tells me she forgot she had it. (How? I've been asking for it for a week?)

Then Sam says some of her things were missing, and that they'd be keeping my jewelry as repayment. She never said what was missing.

Some background I didn't mention in my previous post is that my other sister, Sam, has been on my bad side for a few months now. I fronted $3k for legal representation for Sam last year, and cut her off financially after she lost her third job and second apartment in a year (relying on me to save her ass each time). She didn't attempt to even meet the criteria for her court case and her lawyer dropped her, meaning I paid $3k on a lawyer she never used. She now has a felony and will do jail time if she ever goes back to Nevada. There's been a growing distance there for a while because Sam's own behavior has been so irresponsible.

I know Sam is sensitive (shout out to /r/raisedbynarcissists) but I have been increasingly firm her behavior isn't okay. The fact that she didn't even meet the criteria for her court case is so unacceptable, especially when that was the stipulation for fronting her the money. She's basically expressed to me that I'm not allowed to be pissed 
about it.

Anyways, Sam sent me some mean texts, told me she and Allie are keeping my jewelry and then told me I should have done a better job when I attempted suicide a few years ago.

So obviously I informed them they needed to return my jewelry by the end of the day or I'd take all the texts about it (where Allie admits to 'accidentally' pocketing it and Sam expresses they'll be keeping it) and my purchase receipts and go down to the police station this morning and I'd be filing a report.

Magically, my jewelry was in my mailbox this morning.

Well the long and short of it is that I've cut them both out. They were the last of my (admittedly very broken) family, but as you can probably tell from these posts, it seems like no one has escaped the toxicity. I was pretty willing to make up with Sam if she ever apologized (she never has) and paid me back (I know she never will). I was happy to help Allie in her time of need but she grossly misrepresented her financial situation and was an incredibly rude and entitled (and thieving) house guest. My family has taken advantage of me time and again, and one by one I've been closing the door on them. Sucks to do it again to the girls I loved the most, but I honestly don't see there ever being a way to repair what they've done and said.

Thanks for all the replies I got before, I needed a little support to get a backbone and stop this madness. When you have such a toxic family you really forget what's healthy and what isn't.

**TL;DR** My sister admitted she took my jewelry, then she and my other sister refused to return it. More entitled behavior ensues and finally when I put my foot down I was told to go kill myself. Magically after threatening to go to the police, my jewelry was returned. Officially cut both sisters out of my life."
"UPDATE: My [23F] mom [54F] doesn't want me to apply for a job because it would involve relocation.


Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8tdev3/my_23f_mom_54f_doesnt_want_me_to_apply_for_a_job/).

My post didn't get a lot of attention, but I wanted to update the people who commented and sent me PMs.

I applied for the job. I landed an interview. I got the job.

I told my mom the day I got the call for the interview that I applied for it, and now I had an interview in a few days. She wasn't too pleased that I didn't tell her I applied for the job anyway, but she quickly got over it when I informed her again that I would love to get the job and if I did get it, I saw myself staying with the organization for probably the rest of my life.

She became excited for me, and the day before I left to go to the interview, she expressed how much she was proud of me for following my dreams, like she did not, and not letting anyone stop me, like she did. She wished me good luck and told me that she knew I'd do great.

I start the new job in a few weeks, which will give me plenty of time to get my things together and prepare for a huge move in my life. My boss is extremely excited for me (tbh, I think she helped get me the job. I listed her as a reference, and she knows most of the people I'll be working with), and can't wait to see me succeed in this new position (conservation is a small world).

Thank you to those who told me to go for the job anyway, because without that push from strangers, I don't think I would have applied.

**tl;dr**: I applied for a dream job with a dream company, landed an interview, and accepted the job. I start in a few weeks. My mom is excited, my boss is excited, I'm excited. I still can't believe this."
"Wife (44F) is freaking out to an extreme extent because our son (16M) is hanging out with friends more often. She is constantly anxious that he is up to no good. I (50M) don't know how to deal with her anxiety in relation to him.


My son in the past few months took up skating and biking a lot more, and recently hes been spending pretty much most days outside hanging out with friends. Hes turning 17 in 6 days. 

Just a disclaimer, I have a very unique relationship with my family. I did not know that my son existed until he was 12 years old. Sheila, my wife, contacted me eventually and told me. We had a small fling when I visited NYC, maybe for a week or two, before I went back to California, that is how she got pregnant. I then moved back to Mexico (dual citizenship) for a while. She kept it hidden from me because I was all the way in California and Mexico and she was in NYC, also because she thought I would be a terrible dad (not false, I was a HEAVY drinker, don't do it anymore though) and also that she straight up couldn't get in contact with me. She eventually contacted me and told me, and while she was hesitant to let me see him, I went to see him. Me and Sheila fell in love soon after, and I ended up staying, and we got married. But regardless, I didn't know my son (Kevin) until he was 12. We got along right away though, we have a normal relationship. I just figured I would mention this because its kind of relevant. 

My wife... she just doesn't seem to be able to handle him hanging out or doing social things like that. She freaks out, CONSTANTLY calls him and texts him to find out where he is, demands to talk his friends parents to 'confirm' that they are okay with the other kids hanging out. She has a damn tracker on his phone so she knows where he is at all times. She is just... authoritarian, if that's a way to describe it. She is used to scheduling every little aspect of his life, she is kind of used to hovering over him all the time. She even gets upset at the clothes he wears, he wore his hat backwards and she got upset at him over that and made him wear it forward. 

She sometimes tells me that she is just upset at the culture hes engaging in, and that she wishes she had a 'hipster nice kid' instead of a skater... but he isn't some dusty creepy skater guy. I know those types. I've seen his friends, they aren't really like that at all. I mean they hang out in large groups and are loud and curse, and some of them smoke (what the hell is up with some of these kids and juuls?), but they aren't terrible kids. But my wifes standards are set so high its ridiculous. I mean she even policies what he eats to a large extent, and she gets upset when he isn't super interested in her vegan quinoa organic avocado stuff. She dislikes the video games he plays and says they're too violent, and she gets upset at movie night when he picks movies she disproves of. She wanted to watch Lady Bird, he wanted to watch Mad Max, and apparently that upset her? Because apparently hes obsessed with violence because of his friends? She seems to want him to be a very specific kind of kid, and if he isn't, even a tiny bit, she gets distressed. 

But the real big thing is that she just doesn't seem to like him having unsupervised hang out time with friends. She gets anxious and distressed when he is out with friends at the local park or just roaming the streets. Its like she didn't have a normal teenage childhood, ya know? I mean nothing he is doing is bad. Hes 16, not 12. She seems to think only 'bad' kids hang out like that, and that good kids are productive 24/7 with their time and have scheduled afterschool classes every day and stuff. I've seen them hang out a lot at the local handball court, or just on friends stoops, its normal teenage stuff! They say hi to the neighbors, they have a bunch of friends in the neighborhood, they play handball, they play soccer in the streets with each other, they know all the local pizzeria and bodega owners and chat with them often. He's just a normal local neighborhood kid, nothing bad. I think part of it is that she is from the suburbs, and she might not fully really understand how kids in urban areas grow up. Idk if that is it, but I have always grown up in cities, in Mexico city and LA. What he is doing seems totally normal. 

So even besides the way she treats him, which I disagree with, its not only about him, but about her. She seems INSANELY anxious about this, the 'way he is turning out'. I try to calm her down, to make her feel less anxious, but it isn't working. She is already in therapy, but I am not sure what is going on there. She seems to think at any moment our kid is going to turn into a Harmony Korine feature film. It doesn't help that some of her friends are kind of encouraging this behavior. She seems to have very sort of upper class young urban professional friends who she knows from her yoga classes and cooking sessions and stuff. 

Another factor is that at times, despite being here for quite a few years, I feel like I don't REALLY have control over him the same way she does. I mean, I wasn't there for the first 12 years of his life. I know him well, and love him, but she is clearly the more dominant parent here. I feel weird telling her how to parent him. I mean I have expressed my frustrations at times with how she parents him and said she has to loosen up and that he is a normal kid, but it doesn't seem to work. 

What am I supposed to do? I love her a lot, but this issue specifically is worrying me that he is going to end up hating her. He gets mad at her over this stuff, a lot, and has confided in me that he is just really frustrated with her and feels embarrassed by her sheltering him at times. 

TL;DR - - Wife shelters and smothers our kid. I am new to this family, and I don't know how to deal with this entire issue. "
"Update: My (14/F) daughter is turning into me. (32/M) I don't want her too.


previous: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ii64q/my_14f_daughter_is_turning_into_me_32m_i_dont/

Things have escalated since then but, life is returning to normal. My Parents are watching her now and seem to be doing a good job. She was held back but, allowed a ""second chance"" at summer school where so far she's exceeding.

I made a lot of mistakes I wasn't aware of what I had done. I was too overbearing and made the same mistake my Parents did to me. I was suffocating her and taking away her Independence. That was the exact reason I rebelled against my Parents. As a result she'll be with them for awhile. 

*sigh* I never knew I was making the wrong choices. I was so adamant I wasn't my Dad, I was adamant I was right that I didn't see I was putting a lot of pressure on her. Be good or else you'll end up like me is too much to bare for a kid. She tried telling me how she felt but, I was blind and refused to listen. 

Thankfully she's getting better. My Parents are allowing her freedom but, with a guiding hand. They aren't pressuring her or forcing her to do anything. I've also grown closer to them. I had a long talks with my Dad and in the end we came out closer. A true bond.  She'll come back to me when she's ready. I talk to her daily and see her as much as possible.  She told me she loves me but, wants to find her own path in life without me trying to helicopter parent her. 

*siiiigh* We are our own worst enemy. Parenting is hard. I was never ready no matter how much i tried to tell myself.

---
tl;dr: Life returns to normal. I was suffocating and putting too much pressure on my Daughter. She snapped under the pressure. We all have grown and become closer. "
"Boyfriend [23M] mocks me [23F] for not getting a new car that I certainly can't afford.


My boyfriend and I recently found new jobs and we're making about the same. But I think it's now clear we have very different financial habits. I grew up frugally and I don't like to be in debt at all. He says debt is cool. 

My plan is to pay back my student loans (I have about $10K, he has about $25K) as soon as possible so that I pay less in interest and I can free up my income sooner. He thinks his student loans are too much so he wants to drag it along for as long as he can by paying the minimum.

He recently bought a new car (Honda Accord) and it's a lease and he says he's only paying about $300 a month and he says I should do the same but when I did the math I realized that I would be paying about $12000 in 3 years and I won't even get the car at the end of the lease. This is something I can't afford. I have $3000 in savings for car and my parents and siblings gave me another $2000 so I'm just going to get a $5000 car. Once I'm paid up with the student loans and I have more savings I can sell this and get a better car.

My boyfriend has been mocking me for my decisions and tells me that I'm being crazy frugal and I won't ever enjoy my life with this mindset, he went as far as saying what I'm doing is unhealthy and if I keep this up for a few years it can be borderline mental illness.

How can I get him to stop and respect my financial decisions?

tldr: Boyfriend and I have different spending/saving habits. I live frugally and don't like debt, he's fine with debt. He's mocking me for not leasing a car. How do I get him to respect my financial decisions?"
"UPDATE: Me [24/F] with my boyfriend [25/M], he puts himself in dangerous situations and it worries me


[removed]"
"My [21 F] brother [25 M] refuses to lose weight following a heart attack and it's destroying me.


I've always been extremely close to my older brother; our parents were not good people and it made the three of us (him, me, a younger sister [18 F]) very close. He did an excellent job of being another parent for us, although it's clear he dealt with a lot of issues considerably harder than we did. 

At last measurement, my older brother is over 360 pounds. He's very tall but is still very big, and I'm horribly concerned. He eats horrendously. He'll eat an entire pizza in under an hour and then want to eat something else less than another hour later. I have seen him eat 10 boxes of Mac and Cheese-- each over 1000 calories-- in a single day. He has always been very obese and I've seen how it's impacted his life negatively in all arenas. 

He's an extremely positive and uplifting person and it drives a stake through me to see him so limited and physically impacted by this. Everyone else in our family is very skinny so the contrast is very visible.

A few months ago he had a heart attack. He happened to be less than half a block from a hospital, which probably saved his life. I could go into detail, but basically he was incredibly lucky to survive and has not changed his diet or eating habits whatsoever. He's perfect when it comes to taking his blood thinners/other meds he got following this but he still eats like total crap and whenever I press him he says that he's ""managing"" it but he clearly isn't.

I'm terrified of him dying. It keeps me up at night. The idea of him dying at 25 scares the hell out of me. I love him so much and this is tearing my heart in half.

Does anyone have any advice for this? I've discussed this with my friends and we've half heartedly considered doing some type of intervention thing but no one feels able to start it off. My brother is a very nice ""natural leader"" type of person and it's difficult to want to go against him even when it's this situation and it's clear he's in the wrong.

I can provide more info if anyone needs it.

TL;DR: My brother had a heart attack and is very obese and refuses to change his lifestyle whatsoever past taking his prescribed meds. I'm terrified for his health."
"[Update] How Do I [31F] Tell him I'm a virgin


Update to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8mbx5j/how\_do\_i\_31f\_tell\_him\_im\_a\_virgin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8mbx5j/how_do_i_31f_tell_him_im_a_virgin/)

I just wanted to thank all the redditors for their kind words and help in dealing with this potentially embarrassing situation.  I ended up kind of just blurting it out to him in bed one night.  He didn't treat me like a freak which I appreciated and basically was just like oh okay and went about things and told me he was excited to explore that.  We have since done so :). So that albatross is no longer there :)

"[UPDATE] My (31m) girlfriend (29f) suddenly wants a hysterectomy???


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zl2ok/my_31m_girlfriend_29f_suddenly_wants_a/

I got a lot of advice on the last post from all points of view, and a couple of messages, so I figured I'd do an update. First off, she doesn't actually want a hysterectomy, it was a cry for help or a red flag. Also, I'm an idiot.

So the day after I made the post, I wanted to clear the air because like I'd said, things were chilly and off. So I sat down with her and I had a whole apology planned about doubting her judgment and clearly she knows her body and I was just worried because I love her and I support her and so on and so forth, but I only got partway in before she got upset, told me it doesn't matter because she knows she can't get one and its not happening. Then I got really confused and said if it's what she wants, then I'll help her get one and find the right doctor and we can do our research together. She yelled that she doesn't want one and to drop it and leave her alone. Then she burst into tears and stormed out of the apartment.

So I'm super confused and worried at this point. I didn't call because when she gets this upset, it's better to leave her be. But I sent her a text telling her I love her and I want to fix whatever is going on. She came back an hour later still crying and said she needs to talk and tell me something. I was completely braced for the worst, that she'd cheated or was pregnant, but I think what she said actually hurt more. She wanted the hysterectomy as a last ditch resort to intentionally kill her sex drive. Remember how I mentioned we had a rough patch? About 6 months ago. Well I thought everything was better than ever since then, but what I didn't notice was Ive coincidentally taken on some bigger projects at work since then, which has upped my stress levels, and I didn't notice we've been having less and less sex. She pointed out that we only had sex twice in the past month, and I dont initiate. She also told me her last three relationships ended with dead bedrooms where her partners refused to work on it so she was scared it's happening to her again. She then told me that if it keeps happening to her, that there must be something wrong with her and how awful she feels, so she jus wa ted to not feel any thing sexually. Honestly, the whole thing is heartbreaking and I felt so guilty. She had brought up the sex thing a few times before but I hadnt taken it serious enough and I guess she just gave up.

Anyways, I felt like garbage and I've spent every day since trying to make it up to her (and yes, we've been having sex.) I've also committed to making I initiate and to actually listen before things snowball. She's happier, shes incredible, I'm much better for actually getting some too, and I'm the luckiest man on the planet.

** TL;DR: she didn't want a hysterectomy, she wanted me to get my head out of my ass and pay attention. We're fixing what could have been a dead bedroom, and working on communication. This will probably make us stronger "
"Boyfriend [23M] is upset that he [24M] didn't get a gift at me and my brother's birthday [23F/M, twins]


I wish I was making this up. Last week was our birthday and our big brother [30M] gave us a matching male-female watch set. The set is probably worth around $2000 (so $1000 each).

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and this is the first time he's said something that has totally leaves me in shock. He said this was an inappropriate gift to give to siblings as matching watches are worn by couples. He thinks the appropriate thing for my big brother to do was to give me a matching male-female watch set so that me and my boyfriend can wear them together, and giving a male-female watch set to my brother too, so that he and his girlfriend can wear them together. He even says he could get half as expensive watches so that overall cost remains the same. Or just pick watches that weren't matching. 

So I asked him if he seriously thinks my brother should have given him a watch, on my birthday?! He thinks with the kind of gift that my brother gave me, that was the appropriate thing to do.

And he said he'd appreciates it if my brother and I wouldn't wear these watches to the same event. He's even upset that we posted a picture together on Facebook wearing and showing the watches. He thinks it gives a ""we're a couple vibe.""

I'm out of words to he honest. Is he being silly/stupid/immature/jealous or is there something here that I'm missing?

"My(28) husband(28) wants to separate. I'm 6 weeks away from giving birth.


My husband (28) just told me(28) that he wants to separate. We have a two year old, and I'm 6 weeks away from giving birth to our second. 

He says he's been struggling for several months with this but did not mention this once to me. He doesn't think we're compatible in the long run. We haven't even been fully married a year. He thinks we have different views of family that can't be fixed.

I'm trying not to be hurt but I'm completely devastated.

Im feeling really fucked up and just really need some support I guess.  Like where do I even go from here. How come I'm not important enough to try for. Why was I so blind sided. How can I do this without hating him or myself? How can I tell if he's just having a break down, or if this is really it. 

He mentioned that there's so much he wants to do in life, but apparently that doesn't involve me. He says we're still family but I don't feel that way. I feel betrayed. We were supposed to be best friends. Best friends wouldn't do this to each other. 

I feel stupid. Like I should have known, like we rushed our relationship. We've been together 4 years, I've been pregnant and hormonal for most of it.

How am I going to take care of a newborn by myself?

I feel so unloved and heartbroken. I've been having stomach pains since last night. I'm worried about what this will do to the baby. 

Tl:dr: husband wants to separate. He feels like it's an inevitability, so why draw it out.

"What is the most polite way for me (31M) to uninvite a toddler (2F) from my weekly gathering of friends (21-35 Ms+Fs)?


**tl;dr:** I want to uninvite a toddler from my weekly gathering while minimizing offence to the parents. 

I have a large house. I like having my own space and space enough for family and friends to gather. After college I sustained a social interest in tabletop games and card games. The combination of space and social life has turned Wednesdays into game night at my place. This has been a weekly thing for the past 3 months.

I LOVE hosting. I hand make pizzas and use my friends as test audience for side dishes like wings, bread sticks, and new craft beers and wine. I love having a diverse group of friends who are respectful of my space and grateful for what I can share. We grill out and occasionally make s'mores over the backyard fire. 

I have no children. Most of the people in my friend group don't have kids, but one couple has started to bring their daughter. Initially they would get a babysitter or alternate staying home with the toddler while the other would game, but for the past month they have brought her along. 

My house is not child safe. I have wine, liquor, and beer conveniently placed throughout the house for access while gaming. My hobby room has sharp objects like scissors, boxcutters, pointy metal objects, and exacto knives. I do my best to clear out anything she could reasonably access but every week she gets into something. She had to be extracted from the recycling bin, she had to have a corkscrew taken away from her, and she was caught scooping the litter box by hand. All within the past month. 

Even more than the safety issues, she disrupts my enjoyment. Her screams pierce the house. She does not harm my cats, but she is insistent and demanding when it comes to petting them. She is moody, obnoxious, loud, and uninteresting.

I am 90% certain that her parents will dismiss my safety concerns or offer to childproof the house on my behalf if I try to use that as an excuse to uninvite the toddler. 

Please help me to be direct, but polite as possible, when I ask them not to bring the 2yo."
"My (m/40) wife's (f/36) behavior while drunk at a party with our friends was mortifying. married 6 yrs


Tonight our friends had a Summer cookout party where some people ended up inviting more people. Soon there were maybe 30 people, this was at a state campground site. There was a bonfire, food and lots of alcohol. I do not know how much exactly my wife drank. I just eventually realized I'd seen her with at least a few different drinks, and at this point she was starting to be clearly intoxicated. Slurring, stumbling, very giggly and embarrassing.

I spoke to her privately that she should hold off on any more drinking for a bit. She thought I just needed to lighten up and have fun. She began to try to come on to me, trying to rub my crotch and lifting her shirt up, I'm in a panic to make sure she stops before someone looks over. 

When I pushed her hands away she got pissy. She ignored me saying we're in public. She was wearing a tank top and pulled it down so that her boobs were popping out almost out of her bra. Before I knew it she went back toward everyone else, saying, ""Look what my husband just passed up!!"" I ran the fuck after her but it was too late she was running in between people through the crowd yelling ""TITTIES! Free titty show! Tits anyone???"" then ""tits on a platter, fresh hot titties!"" as she grabbed an empty aluminum tray from the burgers. She poured some guy's beer over her chest and yelled ""wet Tshirt contest!"" while shaking her tits in his face. I also remember her asking a mutual friend if he wanted a tittyfuck!

Okay you get the whole scene...I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Beyond embarrassing, mortifying as I said in the title. There were men openly gawking and whistling. Tons of people laughing. I saw some phones out, for all I know we're a viral laughingstock on the internet now. Everyone was staring as I literally chased my drunken wife around the campground with her boobs flopping everywhere until she tripped and fell. 

That of course was the end of the night for us. I brought her home immediately.

The next thing I did was mass text all our friends who were there apologizing sincerely for her behavior. They all seemed to take it in stride luckily. Sad thing is, they did not seem entirely shocked. It's not THAT out of the ordinary for her, though she hasn't had an incident like this in a few years. I just thought she had normal self control now. Not to mention responsible drinking habits.

This would be one thing for someone 10 years younger, but a married woman pushing 40 and still acting like this? The more I think about it, I'm worried I'll be totally ashamed to be around her in public now. I'll constantly have it in the back of my mind that she could be just a couple drinks away from becoming an x-rated circus clown.

Right now she's passed out in bed but I want to talk to her tomorrow. I sure hope she remembers what happened, she could have been blacked out, I don't know. The thing is she can be pretty sensitive to personal criticism. I want to cool off a bit first (so it's actually good I can't talk to her right now). On top of staying calm what else can I do to talk about this without making her get defensive?

I also don't understand why it happened when she'd been fine with social events and drinking for the past few years. How can I tell if this is the beginning of a relapse, or an accident? 

tl;dr: Went to a party where my wife had too much to drink, ended up running around with her shirt nearly off screaming about her boobs, in front of our friends and a bunch of people we don't know. "
"My (35, M) wife (33, F) has come out as asexual and wants me to accept her for ""who she is""...not sure if that's the real issue


I have been married for 10 years. Fantastic marriage, but the last year or so things have gotten bad. 

We have twin 12 month olds and a 3 year old, so very demanding. She was feeling overwhelmed after the twins, so when they were 2 months old we hired a  mother’s helper to come for 4 or 5 hours a day. She essentially takes over while my wife “practices self-care.” (Her words) This involves the gym, manicures, massages, shopping, or just laying out by the pool. When I come home, I’m expected to do everything with the kids because she’s “with them all day.” She started becoming very distant around this time. 

A few months ago, she decided her body was crushing her self-esteem. She got a $15k “mommy makeover” that included a boob job, tummy tuck, and some lipo. The recovery was pretty intense so her mother came and stayed with us for 6 weeks after that. I was hoping this would help her with the way she feels and our relationship, because she never wants to have sex. I have tried to be understanding.

Now, a couple weeks ago, she tells me she’s asexual and doesn’t experience sexual attraction. In our 10 years of marriage that has never even crossed my mind. She has always had a healthy sex drive. Seems like a difficult act to keep up for 10 plus years. I asked her if she wants to go to counseling, if she thinks it post partum depression, etc and she says she just wants me to accept her the way she is. On top of that, we now are paying a full-time nanny so my wife can have “me time” during the day. When I get home, she often goes out with friends or her sister for drinks or dinner. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I am not buying the asexual thing. She is now contributing nothing to the household, spending money left and right, and gives nothing in return...not even companionship. I tell her I’m unhappy, I feel like she’s a different person, we’re growing apart, etc. she says she wants me to love her for who she is while she “works through” her sexuality. Honestly, I feel used and I even wonder if she’s cheating on me. 

TLDR: Wife acting weird; came out as asexual and wants me to accept her for it"
"My (33/f) fiancé (30/m) of 4 1/2 years has a new friend (late 20s/F) that is making me uncomfortable. I KNOW he is lying about something but have no evidence and I’m worried that cheating has happened or may happen soon. Red flags or am I just jealous?


Blah blah blah. Obligatory we are so happy, best relationship ever, etc etc etc, lol. 

I’ve never once had a reason to distrust my fiancé. He’s been forthright, upfront and honest about everything. I’ve never once thought he was lying about anything until now.

My fiancé is a simple man and doesn’t have a lot of friends. The friends that he does make tend to make are a little more superficial. They are genuine people and relationships, but it’s more like “hey man, let’s grab a beer” kind of stuff. 

He recently befriended a girl at work (who no longer works there). At first, I was absolutely elated. I love for him to have friends because I work about 70 hours a week and I am always encouraging him to get out and do stuff with people. I’ve met her once, when we had an extra ticket to something and invited her along. She is nice enough, but something just really rubbed me the wrong way. I didn’t say anything at the time. 

Recently, I’ve discovered that they’ve been hanging out much more than I actually was told. In addition, he is taking her to do all the things that he and I would have done together. We have a couple “us” things that are special to me, and I’m finding out that even when I asked him to keep those activities for just us, he is actively introducing and encouraging her to do them with him. I feel like he is literally recreating me to either be girlfriend #2 or to replace me altogether at some point?

One of those activities is golf. I asked him to not take her golfing because it really is something he and I do together almost exclusively. I noticed my clubs were all out of place yesterday and I asked him about it and he deflected in a MAJOR way. I KNOW FOR A FACT that my clubs got used by someone else because I keep them meticulously in place and I put them in a specific order. There is zero chance that I put them away in the status they are in now. When I asked him if someone used my clubs he said... “oh yeah, (she) used them before you told me no more golf, sorry.”

This is admission that he remembers me saying I didn’t want him taking her golfing and it’s a lie because he and I went to the driving range much more recently than after I put my foot down about golf. In addition, he lied about being sick in order to take her golfing. My brother lives in the basement and heard someone come in and asked me if I was home, I said no and he said “oh I just heard someone come in upstairs” when my fiancé was pretending to be resting in bed at home “all day”.  So that means he called out of work, went, spoke to me on the phone like he was sick and then let me pick up a huge workload of chores (we are moving and needing to transport/pack/etc) because I believed he didn’t feel good.

It’s not great evidence, but I’m telling you that I am 100% sure that two days prior, my clubs were in the right order and they are not now. His clubs were also dirty. 

He’s also taking her to a rave and I’m pretty sure they are saying in a hotel overnight and he’s not telling me because he knows I will say no. I let them stay in a hotel once before because I had ZERO reason not to trust him. They went to a rave back in the beginning of the friendship and it didn’t make sense for them to be driving home at such a late hour. Now I’m regretting ever being ok with this “friendship”. I want to take it all back.

At this point, I want to say he cannot he her friend at all anymore, but I also feel bad that IF this friendship is completely platonic, I’m ruining his first real friendship in 5-8 years.

This is the first time he’s had a friend that was more than a beer drinking buddy, so I’m not wanting to kill it, but I’m getting sick with anxiety and it’s hurting my heart to be lied to, especially considering she is becoming an extremely viable replacement for me. (She is very pretty, has a great body, etc). I just have a really really bad gut feeling that I can’t seem to make go away.

I have no real evidence that this is happening. No evidence that he lied, and no evidence that he is cheating. I just FEEL like something isn’t right and now that I know (I just can’t prove it) that he is lying. 

When I asked him to give me a reason he would not be with her romantically, he said “she wouldn’t have me”. Which sent my stomach soaring into knots and made me want to barf. That’s not a good reason and I have no idea if he WOULD be with her if she asked him to. 

The worst part is that I am heading on a business trip today where I will be gone for 8 days and I’m freaking out. I love this man with all my heart. He’s been my rock, my moon, my everything and being with him made me a better person. Other than this, we’ve had maybe one or two major disagreements over the entire time we’ve been together. 

Help me reddit! Am I overthinking this or am ignoring red flags? My heart tells me something is going on, my brain says I’m just being jealous because I’ve been so busy and I can’t do anything fun with him right now. 

Sigh. Lay it on me. Ask questions if need be.

**tl;dr - My fiancés new female friend is either making me jealous or I am right to be worried. I know he is lying, but have no proof and I’m worried he is either cheating or about to...**"
"UPDATE: I (25f) have been dating BF (26 m) for nearly a year and he is not sure if he loves me. How long do I wait before I give up and move on?


https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ltf34/me_25f_and_my_boyfriend_26m_of_11_months_he_is


I didn't get a lot of attention on this previous post but I got some valuable advice and figured I should post an update. 


John got back from his vacation mid June and I didn't bring anything up right away since I didn't want to start charging in with relationship questions after his adventure, and honestly I was enjoying being with him and didn't want to ruin the moment with potential breaking up. 



About 2 weeks ago, John asked me to move in with him. I think he could tell I was uncertain when he asked me about it because he said that the conversation we had before he left on vacation was nothing to worry about and that he didn't feel ready to say it yet, but he was ""there"".


I started talking to him a bit more about it, and he said that when he was on vacation he thought maybe we should break up, but the more he thought about it the more miserable he was. And that if he was miserable at the idea of not being with me, that there was no reason we shouldn't be together. 


I know that people said in the previous post that if you're unsure if you're in love, you're not in love. But I think it depends on the individual, the relationship, etc. Ive been in those described ""all consuming"" love relationships and with them I was met with toxicity, manipulation, and abuse. With John it's different. Everything is sweeter, gentler. I can see in his actions every day that he really, truly, cares about me and my well being. And it's not in an all consuming, lightning bolt, romantic kind of way. It feels like we built a strong foundation before the thunderstorm came, so when/if that all consuming feeling hits us, we still have the relationship to fall on once the storm ends. 


I'm not worried about John. The word ""love"" was a point of contention going in to this relationship and I'm in no rush to have the words forced out. Everything that he says and does shows how much he cares about me, and that's enough. I'm okay with our relationship not being linear or following traditional ""steps"". 


Thank you for all of your comments beforehand guys, I appreciate the support!! 


**TLDR - time apart via vacation seemed to help bring things to focus for him. We've decided to go ahead and move in with eachother,  and we're celebrating our 1 year of dating tonight with a fancy ass dinner.**"
"I (26F) was diagnosed with terminal cancer.


It still feels foreign saying those words. I don't think that sentence will ever feel at home coming off my tongue. Regardless of the discomfort, it's true. 

My friends and family don't really understand the severity. They seem to think it's just the worst case scenario, and the diagnosis won't actually come to fruition. This being the case, they aren't the easiest to talk to. I understand denial, but it's just blatant disregard to the truth. 

So here I am, turning to the good folks of Reddit. 

I am in need of ideas. Ideas to encourage me to make the time I have left meaningful. Ideas to help those around me accept the facts, especially my friends. They seem the most confused. Ideas to let them know I love them. 

If you have any advice, words of wisdom, love, or encouragement, I would love to hear them. 

If you have similar stories, please share what helped you cope.

"I [28M] can't afford to fly to my sister's [31F] destination wedding due to urgent medical expenses, and now my mom [60F] thinks I'm being ""selfish"" and a ""failure"" because my insurance doesn't cover the whole of my operation


Hi Reddit, sorry for the first world drama, but here goes.

I teach middle school Science, and have done so since graduating with my MS five years ago.

My sister, a preschool teacher, is about to get married to the son \[30N\] of a local business owner, so the son will one day inherit the business but currently works there under his dad.

My mother has spent her entire adult life as a homemaker. My dad passed away after a tragic car accident ten years ago (he was a pedestrian and struck down by a speeding automobile), but if he were alive he'd be 57 this year. He was an investment banker.

My mom was my dad's sole beneficiary (he never made out a will) and also received well over two million dollars in insurance payouts from the guilty party. My mom lost her husband, but in a strict, technical sense, became monetarily wealthy. She doesn't know anything about money and neither does my sister. I was only nineteen at the time but got my mom in touch with the right people who could take care of her money in such a way that she would never have to work.

So, although she had to downsize from the big house my dad had once paid for, she now has a three bedroom apartment and doesn't really have to worry about money, ever.

Since my mom was on a fixed income I put myself through school, which was just as well, because my mom never offered to help me pay for it. I also moved out of her apartment at age 20. She did pay for my sister to get her degree in early childhood education, and up until my sister's engagement and cohabitation with her fiancée, she lived with my mom in my mom's apartment.

So now my issue is that my sister is having a fancy wedding in Hawaii, that her future father in law is paying for. My mom, sister, and future husband live in Oregon, whereas I live in Washington State.

My sister's future in laws are paying to fly certain guests out, but not others. ""Certain guests"" include my mom. ""But not others"" includes me.

The wedding and it's assorted bruhaha of related events will take about five or six days, so for me to fly out to Hawaii and buy a hotel for myself for almost a week would cost several thousand dollars.

I make enough money as a public school teacher to support myself, but cannot afford to drop several grand on a trip to Hawaii, even if it's for my sister's once in a lifetime event.

What's more, I have a congenital health issue called atrial septal defect, which my parents knew about since I was a little kid but did not begin giving me problems until I was about 26. The palpatations grew steadily worse and doctors told me I needed surgery sooner than later (or ELSE), which, while thankfully covered in a large perecentage by my insurance, still involves what for me is a huge copay of about 20% of nearly $16000 (well over $3000).

Faced with these facts, I told my sister that I cannot attend her wedding.

My sister appears understanding, because several of her friends and some other members of our family also cannot afford to go, whereas only the older or wealther members of our family have the means to attend.

My mom, however, thinks I'm being selfish by scheduling my surgery ""at the same time"" as my sister's wedding. She pointedly told me ""you've had the disease your whole life, a few extra months won't make any difference.""

I told her, actually the doctor said a few months make a huge difference, and not only that, but I don't want to risk my health for a wedding, even if it's my OWN, let alone my sister's.

And not only that, I told her, but I said that even if I did get the money together to go to my sister's wedding, I would still be on the hook to pay for my portion of the insurance-covered surgery.

To this, my mom scoffed and said I should just open a credit card.

Well, I'm not doing any of those things and I'm going to stay home and get my surgery. It's already going to cost me even more money besides, because the surgery will occur during the school year and not during vacation, and the district gives us ten days off per year, no questions asked. I have several days off saved up from previous years that I've rolled over into this year, but even then, my doctor said that my particular surgery requires about two months of no work, and staying at home resting. This means I'll have to go into quite a bit of debt just to recover from my operation.

My mom says that I'm being a drama queen, but I'm ignoring that, nor am I holding it against her for it never even occurring to her to maybe visit her son, one state over, when he's about to have a very risky surgery. Whatever.

What I am worried about is the propaganda she's starting to spread to other people who are going to the wedding, most of whom I don't have much contact with. You see, during my youth, my mom kind of poisoned mine and my sister's relationship with our cousins, usually calling them a bunch of losers and moneygrubbers and thieves (none of which were true, I realize now as an adult). But now that my sister is having a big life event, my mom is using the event as a means to reestablish contact with many of them and use her money to pay for their travel expenses and hotel stays.

I know I shouldn't, but it really irks me that my mom is telling these people I'm a loser or stingy or ""care more about unnecessary surgery"" than representing out family at a wedding.

Also, I don't know the protocol if I've been invited to my own sister's wedding but can't attend. Do I still send a gift? Send money? Nothing?

Appreciate advice on how to cope with this situation.

\*\*TL;DR: I can't attend my sister's destination wedding due to having surgery. My mom says I'm being selfish by choosing surgery over the wedding.\*"
"I (30F) made a request of my husband (30M) - Is it unreasonable?


I’m 7 months pregnant. Prior to pregnancy, my husband and I were big partiers. Not bar hoppers more house parties, drinking at home together, etc. Since becoming pregnant obviously I’ve stopped drinking, and my husband has kept up with how it was pre-pregnancy. About 5 months ago I talked to him about how lonely it feels to be sober when he’s drunk, because I can’t talk to him / he speaks in slurs / he passes out on the couch and I have to figure out how to get him up and get him in bed which is usually a 45-minute ordeal. Eventually, 2 months ago, I asked if he could stop drinking when it was he and I alone together. He said that shouldn’t be a problem.

Recently, it’s turned out “that shouldn’t be a problem” means he’s just going to hide drinking from me. To the point where he’ll lie and say he had nothing to drink and I’ll find mixed drinks stashed away places. We got into a huge argument about it today, where he told me he was living in a prison and I was being unreasonable. I told him he never should’ve agreed to my request to begin with if he didn’t want to follow through, to which he kept screaming “YOU’RE A FUCKING PSYCHO!” He said he wants to drink on weekends because he’s a grown man who can make his own decisions. I never said he had to stop entirely, he can drink with his friends and when we’re at dinner with family and whenever, but when it’s he and I alone at the house I didn’t think it was nuts for him to refrain from getting drunk.

Note here - He doesn’t have a casual beer. He gets DRUNK. Like sloppy, fall down drunk. Not a few beers, which wouldn’t bother me. 

I’m contemplating divorce. I don’t want to raise a baby with someone who can’t NOT drink on a Sunday, and drinking solo was never something we did pre-pregnant. Am I being crazy? I’m pregnant,  so I could be crazy, but I don’t FEEL crazy here. 

Tl;dr - I’m 7 months pregnant and asked my husband to stop drinking when it was he and I alone together, he thinks I’m being unreasonable. "
"Boyfriend (33M) freaked out on me (28F) over a sexy picture I sent.


So this relationship is super new. He (33M) and I (28F) met almost four weeks ago. And were instantly infatuated with each other. It was an immediate transition into one of those disgusting, cutesy couples. Sending cute texts all day with heart emojis... You get it.  

Fast forward to a few days ago. He is in the military, and away for the week for training. We were sending some steamy texts back and forth, when he asked me to send him a sexy picture. I wasn't home at the time, so I sent him an older picture from my phone. And he could tell (based on my hair) that it wasnt something I just took for him. That's when chaos ensued. He completely flipped the switch, telling me how disrespectful I was, asking me why I have old pictures like that on my phone, telling me I probably took it for another guy, and that he felt like he was getting sloppy seconds. He said that he would never even think about sending me a picture he sent to another girl, and how I better get my shit together and delete every picture like that off my phone if we were going to keep being together. I was floored. I meant absolutely no harm in sending him an old picture. I was just trying to keep the mood going... I do have sexy pictures of myself on my phone, and yes, other guys have seen some of them... I honestly wouldn't really think twice about if he sent me something sexy that another girl has seen... We're adults, and other people have seen our genitals. I wouldn't worry about it.  
Since then, things have been completely different. While he said that he trusts me and forgives me, he doesn't treat me the same. The cute texts have completely stopped, on top of the fact that he barely has texted me at all since it happened. And when we do text, he gets standoffish. I brought this all up to him, and he said things were fine, but me worrying about it is annoying.  
Am I in the wrong? I feel tremendously guilty. And I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR - New boyfriend and I were sending steamy texts back and forth. He asked for a sexy picture. I wasn't home, so I sent him one from a while back. He could tell it wasn't new, and completely berated me for it. He eventually said he forgave me, but nothing has been the same since. "
"[26f] super pregnant and super sick of my bf [32] of 5 years


I'm 37 weeks along, so only 3 weeks to go (if I make it that far). 

I found out I was pregnant in December. I've been on BC since we've been dating, so it was definitely an accident and pretty scary not having planned for it. But I always wanted to be a mom someday and had confidence in myself that I could make it work. My bf and I were both happy. 

Thing is, I stepped up, but my bf didn't. At the time, he'd been ""in between jobs"" for about 6 months. I had just quit my job a month prior for a better one, so I knew I wouldn't qualify for maternity leave (you have to be employed there for at least a year) meaning we had to get our asses in gear and start saving NOW. I took every shift I could, even encouraging co-workers to take the day off so I could steal their hours. My boss told me I needed to chill out because I was getting too much overtime for their comfort. But I did what I could while I was still physically able. It was tough. I would wake up, puke, then drag my ass outside to clean snow off the car and work, sometimes for 14 hours. On my feet. It was a trendy, popular high-volume scratch kitchen/bar right next to a mall in the middle of the holiday season. I'd have to clean before opening, do massive amounts of prep in-between line cooking and going to the bathroom, then I'd take on dish duty til it slowed down later at night. It SUCKED. And at the time we were sleeping on a blow up mattress in someone's living room. Which meant if our roommates wanted to stay up and party til 4am, I'd just have to deal and go to work on 2-3 hours sleep. 

My boyfriend didn't find a job til late February. He would apply a bunch of places and never follow up. He'd spend about an hour a week ""job-searching"" and tell me he's doing his best. By this point I was having serious doubts about him and was even getting depressed. I was busting my ass, working, taking the car for repairs, looking at places to live and doing every little productive thing I could while he just sort of breezed by day by day on Netflix. Him getting a job made me feel better and I regained a little hope. Except it was a crap job with low pay and few hours.

Then something happened, that I consider the official moment that I thought ""this is not right. This is fucked."" About an hour into my shift one night, I passed out. Just hit the floor like a ton of bricks in the middle of the kitchen. I was only out for maybe a minute and by then my boss had called paramedics and my co-workers were sitting around me, telling me not to get up and having me sip water even though I insisted I was fine. Paramedics came, I was able to stand, my blood sugar was fine and they asked if I wanted an ambulance. I said no, because America. I tried convincing my boss to let me keep working but he made me call my bf and said not to come to my next shift til I had a doctor's note. When my bf picked me up, I told him I wanted to go to the ER to get checked out, better safe than sorry cause of baby. He argued against it cause it was late and he had to work the next day, but relented and took me anyway. I was just dehydrated but they stuck me with IV fluids and we didn't get home til about 1am. I fell asleep and went to work 6 hours later, doctors note in hand. Found out a few hours later that my bf called in sick to his 12pm, 4 hour shift because he was ""still tired from last night"". That seemed so fucked up to me.

In April, we moved 1000 miles out of state to live with my mom because my work began cutting my hours for health reasons and I had very little faith that we would be able to do this alone. Looking back, I wonder if I should have just left him and came here alone. But I still wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he'd do better. My mom told me not to look for work, but I tried anyway and got turned down multiple times when my pregnancy came up. Bf didn't start working til June, despite my mom trying to hook him up with people who would hire him. He found a shit gas station job, also with low pay. But now since he's working, he's stopped helping out around the house and gets pissed about running errands with me because ""it's my day off"" or ""I have to work today"". I feel bad asking his help for anything and end up doing everything myself even though it feels like someone kicked me in the crotch every time I walk and am still battling nausea. And I haven't slept for longer than 2-3 hours at a time for months. Also, I forgot to mention, he has been prioritizing pot when he gets his paychecks. Buys weed first and then uses the rest (not much) for bare necessities. If we have nothing in the bank account, are low on gas, need shampoo etc, and someone gives him a $5 tip at work, you bet your ass it is gonna go to weed. Guess who ends up always covering our butts? My mom. She fills the gas tank when we have nothing. She buys me shampoo when he blows all of his money. 

Today was when I finally cracked. This morning, he was supposed to go to a paid training class. My mom pulled strings to get him hired into her company, where he'd be making double his current pay, have benefits, good hours and all he'd have to do is drive around all day. Before they hire him, he has to go to paid training classes and then take a test, which my mom's friend is willing to cover the cost of. It's a fantastic opportunity and I'd be doing it myself if I wasn't a ticking birth bomb. He went to one class a few weeks ago, then skipped the rest, telling me ""it's not mandatory and they gave me a packet. All I gotta do is study it and go in for the test."" Packet has actually collected dust now. Then last week my mom said he was scheduled to come in for classes, but was labeled no call no show each day. Said he should have already taken the test and been out in the lot (driver training). He said ""oh I didn't realize"" so mom's friend re-scheduled him for this morning to take the paid class. I woke up at 9, asked him why he wasn't gone yet. He tells me he is gonna call the lady later and let her know he can only come in on Mondays and Tuesdays when he doesn't work, cause he doesn't want to spend 4 hours in class and then go to work for 8 hours. For 3 days. I just sat there, silent, before bursting into tears. I'm not the type of person to lose their shit, but I lost it, people. I cried, I yelled. ""I'm giving birth any day now! You've had so many opportunities and so much time to help our situation and you waste it! I feel fucking helpless right now that I can't contribute financially. We are in the south, in 100 degree weather and the AC in the car STILL isn't fixed! How are we gonna take the baby home?? We'll have to use my mom's two seater. We've needed an oil change since April. I haven't even been able to treat myself to a frozen yogurt in months cause I don't feel comfortable spending the money. Yet there is always, ALWAYS weed in your stash. This is MESSED UP!""
""Chill out! Why are you such a bitch right now?""
""SERIOUSLY? I am ALWAYS chill. I'm the chillest person you know and have been patient and kind through this whole pregnancy, even when you couldn't do the same! And don't you DARE call me a bitch for finally getting angry! I'm doing everything I can while you procrastinate and do the bare minimum. You skipped work yesterday cause you were nauseous and I babied you ALL DAY. I even rubbed your back directly after puking and pissing myself. I'm over it and you need to get your shit together if this is going to work"". He went on to get pissed, saying I shouldn't be doing such nice things if I'm just going to throw it in his face, he's doing his best and I'm not being appreciative, etc. I shut down, went to another room and haven't spoken to him since. He's at work now. I'm just so angry and trying to calm down, so there's been a lot of venting and probably unnecessary details in this post. I'm sorry it's gotten this long winded. 

Now I don't know what to do. Ultimately, I want what's best for the baby, and I no longer feel confident that keeping my bf is part of that. But if he leaves, I don't even know where he'd go. There's no way he's gonna find an affordable place with his shitty paycheck and lack of responsibility. Also, if he leaves I'll have to solely rely on my mom financially and I don't want to do that to her. We could send him back up north on a bus, where he has family, but then co-parenting becomes an issue. Regardless of his bullshit, I still love him and I don't want to deprive him of seeing our son, and deprive our son of seeing him. But I also don't want our son feeding off of the stress of our strained relationship. I don't want to end up working, scheduling appointments and taking on majority baby care because my bf is too lazy. Weirdly, I'd be fine with it if I was alone. I'm just not fine with it when there's a perfectly capable father around who chooses inactivity instead. 

TL;DR about to give birth and have become incredibly resentful towards my bf for not putting in as much effort as he could have for the last 9 months. Now I'm depressed and worried about the future for us and our baby. "
"Me [25F] and a friend [23F], weird conflict over engagement/rings


My fiance and I recently got engaged after dating for five years. We picked out the ring together a couple of months ago, but the exact time and manner of the proposal was a surprise. We announced the engagement to our friends and family and on Facebook about two weeks ago and are planning to get married in 2-3 years.

I have a friend, ""Callie,"" who has been dating her boyfriend for three years. A couple days after I announced my engagement, Callie posted a picture of her and her boyfriend holding hands, with the focus on a diamond ring on her left hand. It was posted without a caption, but naturally I assumed they were engaged. I commented ""Congrats!!"" A couple of minutes later, I got a text from Callie that just said ""It's a promise ring, but thanks."" I texted back, ""Still, congrats! It's a really pretty ring."" A couple hours go by and then I get a text back, ""Yeah, thanks. I can't believe you thought it was an engagement ring.""

Like...I don't know, dude. You're living with your boyfriend, you've been dating for several years, you posted a picture of a diamond ring on your hand and didn't say it was a promise ring. How was I supposed to know? Also not to be a jerk but I didn't consider the possibility that it was a promise ring because we aren't in 8th grade. I didn't tell her that though, I just said it was a really pretty ring and it must be exciting to be moving forward with (boyfriend.)

Since then she has been...weird. I have a lot of older family members on Facebook and they post questions on my timeline like when the wedding is, etc. I usually just say ""I will text you in a minute with details! :)"" On one of these posts, Callie replied saying ""We get it, you're engaged."" I didn't know if she was joking or being serious but I deleted the comment since people who don't know her were taking it as an insult and I don't like social media drama.

She also texts me asking 1000 questions about the wedding/engagement but only really seems interested in picking apart my answers? I told her we were gonna be engaged for a couple years before getting married, she asked why, I said I would just rather get married closer to 30 than 25. She replied, ""Wow. Okay.""

She's asked me questions about the engagement ring like if it's got real diamonds, carat weight, and so on, and always tries to one-up me with stats about her promise ring. And in conversation I have just gotten the feeling that she wants me to treat her like she is engaged too when we talk about wedding stuff, and fishes for me to ask her the same questions back that she is asking me. But when I do she turns around and acts like I'm dumb and don't  know the difference between a promise ring and an engagement ring.

Help? Our relationship was never, you know...blood sisters or anything, but I have always thought of her as a pretty good friend, but I don't understand this behavior.

tl;dr: I got engaged, my friend got a promise ring shortly after and is weirdly competitive about it."
"My [25F] fiance [28M] got really drunk at his friends wedding and said he doesnt need me and wants to call off the wedding


 **TLDR:  my fiance got wasted (normally doesnt drink) at a friends wedding, got triggered and went off saying how he doesnt need me anymore and wants to call off the wedding**

I am using a throwaway account as I don't know what to think about all of this.

I am recently engaged and he proposed to me about a month. We have already hired a wedding planner and have put down the deposit for the wedding venue for August 2019. We have been together for about 4 years and our first year was very rocky. We had broke up for 1 week and got back together because we did not agree with each other and would always bring up each others past. He would always praise his last FWB and ask me why i wouldn't be like her and he would always put her above me. We broke up but then he actually came back to me asking for another chance and ever since then, I took him back and we have been pretty smooth sailing since.

Yesterday, we attended a wedding and he was a groomsmen and part of the wedding party and I was his plus one and I did not know anyone else at the wedding. But I did try my best to make friends with the people at my table and did not need him for most of the time. At the very end, people started to leave and he probably at least took around 10+ shots at this point, mixing liquor and wine and they were all taking shots at the open bar and then he left me at the dinner table by myself to go outside to the photobooth with the others. The important thing to note is that he does not drink this much often. The last time he did this was probably before he met me, over 4 years ago. I got upset because he could have invited me out with them to the photobooth rather than leaving me by myself, when i already did not know anyone as my table friends left the wedding already. I later went outside and sat next to the photobooth and he realized I was upset. He sat next to me and couldnt comprehend why I was upset at him after i had explained to him and all I wanted was an apology and thats it, we could move forward. But instead, he was suddenly triggered and he said he was so sick of me and that he doesnt want to marry me anymore and kept repeating himself over and over again. The groom, groomsmen and other friends had to stop him from saying so many hurtful words and told me that I shouldnt stick around to hear it because he really doesnt mean it.

The bridesmaids, who i did not know, were all very kind and told me that I should just leave the venue without him because he definitely was not the person he was in the afternoon when he was sober. Everyone had said he spoke the world of me and constantly said i'm the best girl ever. I said bye to the bride and groom and he clapped as I walked out. He ended up taking the cab home as I was originally his ride home.

At this point, he has not messaged me at all. I dont know what to think, or feel. But I do remember he said he used to blackout drunk before he met me. I'm not used to dealing with people who drink that much so i'm not sure if I can move forward with the wedding with or without an apology."
"I [26M] want to help my wife [25F] with a dramatic transition


So I've only really posted on jnmil, but a quick overview is that my wife gave birth to twins a few months ago and we recently took in my 12 year old sister as well. This is obviously a lot of change and is a lot more than expected. My wife is not working until September and I work full time so the majority of childcare has fallen on her and I can tell that it is affecting her.

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced a dramatic change in home life (the transition from no kids to three kids is pretty wild). My wife and I haven't had a second alone together in a while since we're all stuffed in a small apartment for now. We also cannot leave my sister with anyone else overnight as per the current custody ruling and she is not comfortable with anyone but us and MIL anyway. 

Basically, I was wondering if anyone who has struggled with such a dramatic shift could tell me what they wish their partners had done/said to them. I'm trying to encourage my wife and help her out but I can also tell that she is overwhelmed at times. Also, since my wife is the kind of person who responds better to gestures and gifts than to words, does anyone have any suggestions on things that I could do for her to encourage her and make her feel loved? We're tight on money and quality time right now so I'm struggling to think of something inexpensive but meaningful.

**tl;dr I can tell my wife is struggling with the huge increase in childcare responsibilities. How can I help her feel validated and cared for?**"
"All of my [20 F] family died and I've become an agoraphobic wreck


Two years ago my life was literally next to perfect. I just had graduated HS and everything was good, was going to college on a mostly paid athletic scholarship. I loved my family. We got along so well. It wasn't like the thing where I didn't know how good I had it until they were gone I really loved and appreciated them and we spent so much time together. 

During the summer in between my graduation and when I was meant to go to college my family went to a water park for a day trip while I was with my friend and they were caught in a car accident on the way back. All five, my mother, father, sisters and brother all died. 

I lost my mind. Just dropped all of my classes, never even went to the school after orientation. My parents owned several properties and our house and I basically had no idea what I was doing but I had them all sold in the span of four months and threw most of our stuff out and ran away to another part of the country because I wanted to get far far far away and stop thinking about it. 

My life is pointless. I live in this tiny cheap apartment and eat noodles for every meal and watch cartoons and wait for nothing. I miss my family so much. I go out twice a week to walmart and use the self checkout so I don't have to talk to anyone. I haven't spoken to another human being in person since last December when someone who I knew in HS heard what happened to me and tried calling because they wanted to convert me to christianity. I have no other family outside of an aunt I've never spoken to and all my friends and my family's friends stopped calling and texting forever ago when I stopped talking to them and moved out of town.

My living costs are so low and I have enough money from what my parents left behind I realized I have enough money to live like this forever and it terrifies me. I hate my life so much. I miss talking to anyone but have become so afraid of people. I used to like my body and staying inside all day and eating the garbage I do has turned my into a disgusting skinny pale freak. I'm so dumb from the lack of stimulation.

I can't see any way out of this mess. everyday i tell myself that I'll change something but I just sit and watch netflix and cry. i'm so fucking scared and sad all the time.

TL;DR: All my family died two years ago and I turned into a disgusting agoraphobic loser. I'm afraid and depressed and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore."
"My [F20] boyfriend [21M] just told me he’s moving 1,200 miles away next week. We live together.


(Throwaway since my bf knows my reddit account)

Hi all, I really need some advice/help/words anything right now really.

My bf and I have been living together for just over a year now. We’ve been going to the same school for 2 years and this year was going to be no different aside from the fact that we were transferring to a university.

When I had first been accepted I put in an application for housing there as he had also applied to a university 1,200 miles away. He has family down there so it was understandable why he chose to apply. So I didn’t know what my housing situation was going to look like for the fall semester and decided to use dorming as my back up plan.

Towards the middle of June, he had not heard from the other school which he found odd given that most schools make decisions in the springtime. We began to seriously consider looking at other apartments around the area of our local university.

We put in an application for a place a few weeks later and we’re approved. Since we planned on moving, I cancelled my housing request at my university due to the fact that it was going to cost me a fee to cancel any later and I had already had a new apartment lined up for me.

Fast forward about 2 weeks, he gets accepted into this school that’s states away but says he’s not sure what he wants to do... great. His sister is desperately trying to get him to come back home and his mom wants him to come home too. Most of his family are down there and no one is really up here for him anymore. So basically it was me vs the entire family.

A few days passed and he still never really definitively said yes or no, it all would depend on certain factors and so on. Until yesterday when he told me he’d most likely be leaving on the 3rd. (Which is next week by the way.) Leaving me without an immediate place to live nor a place for the upcoming semester. It was like my entire world was flipped upside down in one moment.

Before you ask: my mom will not let me move back in, she has taken in my nephew and both bedrooms in her house are full, and my dad lives quite a few states away so that does not help me at all.

I’m not even sure what to do right now. I told him I don’t think we should be together anymore. Seems pretty useless to continue a relationship at this point. I’m so hurt/angry/confused/scared all at the same time. I never imagined this would happened.

TLDR; Boyfriend and I we’re supposed to move closer to school together. Decided last minute he’s leaving next week to go to a completely different school 1,200 miles away, leaving me homeless."
"My [17F] stepbrother [22M] destroyed my things in a rage and my mom and stepdad won't punish him for it.


Idk if it matters but my stepbrother is 22 and os autistic. He can only speak a few sentences and usually points and grunts when he really wants something. He is very violent and if he doesnt get his wa yall the time he freaks out. My stepdad has to restrain him pretty often because he's freaked out and punched holes in walls and likes to throw glasses and things like that. He's just very emotional and doesnt know how to control them I guess

This morning I was getting ready for work (I baby sit during the summer to bring in a little extra money) and because we share a bathroom he started banging on the door to come in. He tried to open the door on me while I was using the toilet and I told him to stop and locked the door before he got it open. he called me a fu**ing c**t and went to use my parents bathroom. I left to go to my job before he got out. My mom stays home and works during th e day so someone can be there to keep an eye on him so I didnt think anything would happen. He's messed up things before (like punching the tv when a show he wanted isn't on or throwing a glass when he isn't getting what he wants for dinner) but I didn't think he would go into the bathroom and ruin my things

When I got home today I really had to use the bathroom so I went into ours and was really pissed and upset with what UI saw. He had taken scissors to cut my flat iron cord, he had thrown my eyeshadow palettes on the floor and had stomped on them so eyeshadow was ALL OVER THE FLOOR. He had went under the cabinet and grabbed my package of pads and had ripped them all up Pretty much anything that was mine he ruined. I showed my mom what happened and she asked him if he did do it and he admitted to it

Im really upset and pissed off because my mom and stepdad said they aren't going tp punish him for this. They said I should have let him open the door (and see me peeing, no thanks) and let him see for himself I was busy in the bathroom and i should have put my stuff away better so he couldnt have messed it up. My stepdad said if they did punish him, he wouldnt understand what it wad for and it would probably make him freak out again and destroy more stuff.

I asked m mom if she could help me replace everything he destroyed and I would pay her back when I got paid from baby sitting and she said no. She accused me of ""setting him up "" to get him in trouble and told me since it was all my stuff I will have to earn it all back. Which will take me months because it took months of babysitting and walking dogs and cutting grass to get my makeup and flat iron and pads in the first place!

My mom and stepdad told me I shouldn't be mad at my stepbrother because he ""doesnt know any better"" but I really am. I don't think it's fair he gets to ruin other people's stuff with no repercussions  when a 5 yr old knows better. ''


How do I stop being mad at him? How do I prevent this from happening again (besides putting my things in my room now and only taking them to the bathroom when needed) Can I do anything to make him understand that he shouldn't do this shit or am I going to have to deal with him tantruming out like a 3yr old every time he doesn't get way? 


tl;dr: My autistic stepbrother destroyed our bathroom and my things because he didn't get his way. Parents won't do anything about it and accused me of setting him up. How do I prevent from happening again? How do I deal with my anger towards him right now?"
"I [24 M] caught my live-in girlfriend (2 years) [27F] in a lie.


My girlfriend and I have had a bit of a rough patch lately. We're on a lease for another 4 months, and she's expressed that she wants to leave at the end of the lease, but that she still loves me. She says she loves me but also says that I'm not the one.

There's a guy she's been hanging out with, and it's given me a gut feeling that something's up. I confronted her about this guy and she admitted to me that yes, they like each other, but that it's just  a ""sexual tension thing at work"" and that I don't need to worry. She told me she is remaining faithful to me.

Anyways, she's on this backpacking trip right now. She's been talking about it for weeks, how she was going to go with her girl friend for a couple nights. No big deal, sounded fun. I asked her to give me her friend's number before she left, just in case they got lost or something and I needed to get ahold of her.

I texted her friend just saying ""Hey friend, this is /u/aegis2293, my GF gave me your number just in case you guys get lost in the woods.""

Her friend texts back saying she had no idea what I was talking about, and didn't have plans with my gf. She said they had been talking about a backpacking trip for awhile, but never made any solid plans.

I can't call her and confront her about this right now, because her phone's off. And even if it was, she probably doesn't have service. If she is where she says she is. But she's been packing her backpack for the last 2 days, so unless that's all a big show, i'm guessing she really is backpacking.

I don't know what to do. I feel dead inside. I feel so betrayed. I just wish I could call her and ask her what the fuck is going on. She'll be back tomorrow, but it's gonna kill me to be in limbo like this waiting this long. 

I may have left out some important details and this may be incoherent, but naturally, I didn't sleep last night and haven't eaten. I'm a wreck. 

I'm not sure what to do. Help? 

TL;DR Girlfriend lied about going backpacking with a friend, and I think she went with another dude instead. I'm heartbroken, and can't get ahold of her.

"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] does not respect my need for sleep and an earlier bedtime


This has been an ongoing issue for the last three years that we have been together. In short, we end up fighting almost every time I try to go to bed before she does. I am looking for community feedback on the issue and advice on how to set boundaries and talk with her appropriately.

A little about us- We have been together for six years and living together for the last three. I am engaged in a fairly high stress profession that can have some demanding hours - I am usually out of the house by 7:30, and am frequently not finished with work until around 6:00 or so; some days I need to go in for work much earlier. She also works a fairly high stress job, but works shorter hours and has a more flexible schedule - going into work at 9:00ish and leaving before 6:00. She has always been a night owl- when we first started dating in college she would routinely stay up until 2:00 am or later and then sleep until past noon. I have always been unable to sleep much past 8:00 am, and so typically turn into a pumpkin around 12:00 at the absolute latest. My bedtime routine is pretty simple, I go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, and am done. Hers is a little more involved; she is into Asian beauty products and has a whole bedtime routine that she tries to do every night. The problem is that she also has a tendency to pick at pimples and other marks on her face if left unattended - so she asks me to help her out by hanging out with her while she does her routine to make sure that she does not pick at her face. I don't mind doing this, but often our issues related to bedtime stem from her wanting me to wait around for her to be ready to do her routine. FWIW- she has ADHD and takes daily medications for it, but those have long worn off by the time we are thinking about bed.

Now onto the issue - it seems like almost invariably when I want to go to bed early we end up in an enormous fight.

Last night, for example, we watched a movie that ended around midnight. I told her that I didn't really want to watch anything else, and that if she wanted to stay up I could play some video games with her to keep me engaged and awake. She didn't want to do this and instead wanted to watch a nature documentary on Netflix- so I agreed. But after twenty minutes of knock-off David Attenborough, I started nodding off. I was exhausted and the show, while cute, was putting me to sleep. But rather then let me doze while she watched the show, she started poking me to wake me up. I'd stay alert for a second but slowly then drift back to sleep, prompting her to poke me again. This continued until she was mad at me for sleeping and I was mad at her for waking me up constantly. We argued, until finally she demanded that I leave the room after announcing that I had ruined what had been a nice night by falling asleep during the show. I went to bed, and at around 3:00 woke up to discover that while she had come to be as well, she had left every light in the house on, including the lights in the bedroom. So I had to get up and turn off all the lights that she left on.

This sort of occurrence is not uncommon. In the past when I have gone to bed early (particularly if we have been fighting with each other) she will wait until I have fallen asleep and then employ a number of tactics to wake me up again later: we have wifi controlled bedside lights and she likes to flick them on and off repeatedly to keep me awake; one time she used my icloud login to make my phone do the lost phone ping every few seconds. She doesn't seem to understand that this conduct is unacceptable. She justifies it because she thinks she feels entitled to an apology for whatever started the fight off in the first place (often me being gumpy at her for not going to bed sooner). It does not often get to this point where she is actively preventing me from sleeping - but it has happened four or five times this year.

More frequently she just demands that I stay up later and later to watch her wash her face. She'll be on her computer or her phone deep into Reddit, and she refuses to set her computer down (because it breaks her chain of thought) to go wash her face when I tell her that I want to go to bed. Rather, she wants me to sit and wait until she is done browsing before she will get up wash her face. It's not just a minute or two to finish up an article- it's fifteen or twenty minutes to finish up all her open tabs. And if I nag her about going to bed during this time she just gets angry because I interrupted her train of thought. Often, once I \[literally\] coax her off of the couch and she has washed her face, she will then decide that she actually does need to do those chores that she put off for the entire evening like running the laundry machine. It is not infrequent that I will tell her that I need to head to bed at 11:00 and that we don't actually go to bed until 12:30.

I can't keep doing this. My job performance and mental health have suffered because I end up either staying up to later either indulging her demands for more time, or because we don't and we end up in these long fights that takes hours off my needed sleep schedule. I am already running very close to the line of not enough sleep as it is; I just want her to respect my need for sleep. I don't feel like I can to to bed before her without it becoming a fight.

**TL:DR - Girlfriend of six years gets mad when I want to go to bed earlier then she does and then escalates the situation by rudely waking me up if I try to go to sleep early.**  "
"[NSFW] My (25f) boyfriend (27m) won't have sex with me unless I orgasm first.


Throwaway account. I have a feeling this is gonna be a weird post, so I apologize in advance.

I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, we've lived together for 1 year.

I was recently put onto a new medication to treat my depression. It's like a miracle drug - I feel human for the first time in months - but the downside is that my most noticeable side effect is an inability to orgasm. It doesn't matter what I do, I just can't get there. I managed it once: I was by myself, it took half an hour with porn and a vibe, and the orgasm itself was kind of uncomfortable and not very pleasurable. Basically I've accepted that I might never come the same again. It's frustrating, but the pros of these meds outweigh the cons, so I don't really care too much. My sex drive remains the same and sex still feels good, I just can't reach orgasm.

I told my boyfriend about this side effect after a couple of times of him trying and failing to get me off, but he seemed to see it as more of a challenge than a problem. I appreciate that he is willing to try really hard to make me feel good but it's starting to become an issue.

We do mix up our sex life quite a bit, but our general ""usual routine"" starts with foreplay, then him making me come, then us having PIV until he comes. This worked well before I was put on these meds, but not so well now. I've tried to ask him if we can just jump straight to PIV without bothering to try and make me come, but he's really determined that I need to do it. He says things like ""you know the rules, you come first"" or ""I'm not putting it in until you come"". These things are said in a playful, sexy tone, but it really piles the pressure on me and makes me frustrated. PIV sex still feels really good for me, so I'd rather do that. Laying there while he tries to get me off and knowing it won't happen just ruins the mood for me, and it ruins the mood for him when I ask him to stop because nothing is happening.

The thing is, I've actually faked orgasm a couple of times just to get things moving. I really regret doing that because I know it was counterproductive, and I feel deceptive and guilty for doing so. It was a huge mistake because now my boyfriend believes that I CAN get there if he keeps trying. I understand that this is entirely my fault for faking it, but I'm not sure how to dig myself out of this hole without hurting his feelings and damaging his trust.

Our relationship is otherwise great. We're really good at communicating issues, but I'm at a loss for how to approach this one. What's the best way to communicate to my boyfriend that I really can't orgasm any more, and would rather just have foreplay and PIV? Also, do I come clean about faking it a couple of times?

Note: I know that one solution to the whole thing is to try a new medication which might not have this side effect. However I've tried multiple antidepressants over the years and this is the best one by far for treating my illness. I don't want to end up back at square one with my mental health, because that is the most important thing. It's likely that I'll need to remain on this medication for the foreseeable future.

**TL;DR: I can't orgasm any more because of medication. Boyfriend sees it as a challenge and is determined to make me come before he does. Not sure how to communicate my frustration.**"
"My [31F] boyfriend [33M] is *very* upset with me because someone danced with me for &lt;10 seconds at a bachelorette party/nightclub.


I'll make this brief but basically the title.  This past weekend, I attended a bachelorette party.  On Saturday night, the girls and I  (9+bride, so 10 of us total) went out in a city downtown to a nightclub.  The girls were dancing in a circle around the bride.  The bride pushed me towards someone and told me to dance with him and I made a face to her like, 'no nooooo i'm good'.  My back was to the guy, i couldn't see his face.  He put his hand on my waist and then moved it up and touched my left breast and I immediately shoved him the fuck off me and moved myself to other side of the girl-dancing-circle.  This whole thing lasted 10 seconds... maybe 20 seconds if i am being generous.  &lt;/end scene&gt;.   

When I got home and told my boyfriend about the incident honestly, he become very upset, kicked me out of his house while saying ""fuck you"".  I took this to mean he thinks I cheated on him.   Did I?  I immediately rejected the guy at the club, but my boyfriend feels like the fact that it made it waist/boob grabbing means I cheated on him.  I tried to explain that I cannot control what other people do, but i immediately removed myself from the situation.  My boyfriend is considering breaking up over this.  We have been together for 2.5 years.  

TL;DR:  A stranger at a nightclub grabbed my waist and left breast.  I immediately shoved the guy off me and removed myself.  I told my boyfriend honestly about the situation when I got home, but now my boyfriend thinks I cheated on him"
"My [26 F] roommate's [24 F] severe medical condition prevents me from having frequent access to our bathroom. How can we make sure I get my fair share of bathroom time?


I live in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment with my roommate.  We’ve known each other for about 2.5 years and have lived together for five months.  She’s really nice and generally a good roommate—cleans up after herself, doesn’t steal my food, etc.  

About a month after we moved in together, she got diagnosed with a chronic disease.  For privacy’s sake, I won’t share what it is, but one symptom is that she’ll have unexpected diarrhea and/or constipation, depending on the day.  She’s working with her doctor to get the condition under control (I feel like the poor woman is constantly at the doctor’s), but so far her symptoms are pretty severe.

However...this also means that it’s sometimes a struggle to get into the bathroom.  Here are some examples:

* I've been late to work 4 times over the past five months because she was in the bathroom all morning.
* I’ve stopped inviting guests over after she was in the bathroom for almost 3 hours and my friend had to go pee in a bush. 
* I've had to pee in the sink a couple times because she was as taking so long.
* I get kicked out of the bathroom about once a week because she's having an emergency.

She’s very apologetic, acknowledges that it’s a problem, and even keeps me updated on her doctor’s appointments.  I know that she’s trying to really hard to fix it. But this has been going on for months, and I’m really sick of not being able to use the bathroom in my own house. 

The most recent incident was yesterday (and what’s prompting me to write this post).  I was taking a shower before I went out to dinner, and she starts knocking on the door and says she has to go NOW.  So I had to get out of the shower, with shampoo still in my hair, and stand there cold and wet in the hallway for 20 minutes until she was finished.  

I’m not proud of it, but I yelled at her.  I was like, “I seriously can’t even fucking take a shower in my own house?? You need to get this under control!” I finished showering and when I came out, she was gone.  She texted me and said she was staying at her parents’ until Tuesday (tomorrow).

She’ll be back tomorrow night.  I want to talk to her and apologize; however, I also need to let her know how frustrated I am and see if we can come up with a solution.  I’m stuck, though.  There’s only one bathroom in our house, our lease isn’t up for another seven months, and she’s trying as hard as she can to get this under control.  

Any suggestions would be very appreciated.  I’m at my wit’s end here.

**\*\*TL;DR: My roommate's severe medical condition has her in the bathroom constantly, to the point where I can barely use it.  How can we make sure I get my fair share of bathroom time?\*\***"
"My [29F] mother and sister in law [58F, 25F] came to visit us and have filled our house with black magic curses (?) against me


So I am gonna keep it short and sweet. English is my second language and I am kind of tired so please bear with me. I have been married to husband [31]  for 1 year, together for 3,5.

Soooooo mother and sister in law came to visit us for 6 weeks from their home country. We organised this whole time to take good care of them and keep them happy and entertained, bending our schedules and pleasing them in general. We both try to please our families as much as possible since we are far away from them and love them.

His family has never been a fan of me but he has my back. We come from different cultures and still we have from time to time issues regarding my outsider status and me being quite direct person (to what is acceptable for a woman in their eyes). We pick our fights wisely.

So what we though to be a family trip apparently had other intentions because holy shit. I keep finding black magic crap they have brought into my house. They are like small papers with my name and some curse gibberish witten on them. Or threads. At this point everytime I found one I keep laughing histerically. More than a dozen inside my pillow (wishing me bad sleep/health?). In the sugar I use for tea. In between my clothes. Inside my shampoo (loss of hair?). Under the carpets. Behind one mirror.

It is like what the fuck. They come as guests and do this. They know i will find and know it must have been them since we do not have other friends from their culture. They paid somebody to make these things, by the way. 

I know we have had our issues but this is so pathetic. Me and husband are jot sure how to bring up. He is kind of mortified by the whole thing and shutted down. I want to give him a couple of days before tryimg to talk about it again. 

Tldr; in laws come and fill my house to the brim with black magic curses on me lol. How to address the crazyness?"
"My [25yr F] mother [50yr F] doesn't respect boundaries or that I work shift work, anytime I approach the subject she becomes ""hurt"" that I am upset.


Hey, long time lurker, first time poster, etc etc. 

I'm a 25 year old female, and live with my 27 year old boyfriend a few provinces away from my 50 year old mother (We're in Canada, if that isn't clear).

I'm a first responder, so I live the life of shift work. We're talking nine work days/nights, two or three days off, eight work days/nights. My boyfriend and I work the same job, but are on opposite shifts, so we catch each other at the end of one person's day and the start of the other's, and vice versa.

It sucks, but we're just happy to get whatever time together we can. The reason for this bit of back story is to highlight how little time I actually have for me, my boyfriend, my chores/hobbies etc.

On to my mother. She has been helpful in my life, I won't deny that. She has given up her time to drive me to interviews, tests etc when I was applying to my job. She let me keep my belongings in her garage while I was away for the requisite 6 months of training my job required.

My issues with my mother stem from her not respecting boundaries that I try to set. She alternates between treating me like I am 12 years old and like I am her best adult friend. She's done this my entire life, including when I actually was 12. I've had a long history of not enjoying living with her, hating my step-father, hating my living situation, nothing unique I'm sure to many who read this sub.

When I was away at my hellishly long training for *job*, I left my car at her house, with her permission, and the understanding that it would be there until I finished training.

About a month before graduation, she advised me that she had sold my car, a hatch back Mazda, which I loved and was still in fine shape, for a 2005 Ford Escape. At the time, she lied to me, telling me that the Mazda sold for $2000.00, and that the Ford cost $4000.00. She told me I owed her $2000.00 to even the difference.

I was upset. Like, very upset. I was 24 at the time, in a huge moment of my career, about to join the ranks of *job*, and she had decided to do this for me without asking, without even considering what I wanted or what I planned. My job meant I'd be leaving the province she was in, and going to another. I had planned to bring my Mazda, drive it into the ground and buy either a new or used vehicle from a dealership. 

She became hurt that I wasn't immediately pleased and happy that she had ""helped"" me. She lied, and told me she had searched for used vehicles in my new province and couldn't find any (which is a joke, everywhere in Canada has far too many vehicles for sale, save our super, super remote rural friends).

I sucked it up, and told her thanks. I didn't want to fight with her when I had a celebratory event coming up for completing training. My mother showed up for said event, with my step-father (I am less than a fan, to be polite), as well as my aunt and uncle, both of whom I adore. 

I tried to bring up how unhappy I was that she had gone ahead and done something so permanent without even consulting me, but each time I did she would either hide behind one of the others, or would act hurt again. I stopped trying.

Fast forward slightly, and I'm in new province. Vehicle is shipped from old province to new province by *job*. My mother spent more of my money getting the Ford safety-ed in old province, when new province was very clear that it would not be accepted. So, I get to spend more money safety-ing it in new province. First week of driving the Ford, the alternator goes. That's more of my money.

The tires are old and deflating, the gears stick when the vehicle drives. It is horrible on gas. All things my Mazda had no issues with. 

Fast forward more. My mother invites herself to new province six months after I'm here. I didn't invite her. I didn't tell her she could come visit, or stay in my home. I'm new at work, learning lots, and need to focus on my job. Add in shift work, so her visit was mostly me going to bed whenever she got up, or being gone all the time. All of which was ""rude"" of me according to her.

Don't forget that throughout her visit, she badgers me about my fiances, demanding I allow her access to my bank account, interrogating me about my birth control pills, my eating habits etc. I held my ground, told her it isn't her business. Cue sulking and acting hurt. (She routinely asks these questions during phone calls too).

She leaves, my life gets better, I move in with boyfriend. Now, I've spent my whole life dealing with my mother, so I don't say a word of the move in to her until our lease has been signed and we have a move-in date.

When I decide its time to break the news, she's immediately hostile, upset that she didn't get a say in which place we rented. She's harsh and critical, telling me the place we chose was terrible, and that we would regret moving there.

We love it here. We live in a cottage on the lake. Its fucking awesome. We see the coolest thunderstorms (like right this moment). 

Anyway, she invites herself up, again. Without asking if it was convenient or would work for us. She just picked a date and said she expected me to pick her up at the airport. Which is three hours away. So, I leave my town, drive three hours, get her, turn around immediately and drive three hours back, cause guess what? Shift work means I worked that night shift. (I was more grumpy than usual that night).

I had to use a vacation day in order to go get her. I'm still a little angry about that. 

She chose the week where boyfriend and I were moving two apartments into one cottage. Knowing we'd both be busy at work and doing the move. And she still chose to come, to ""help"". Aka make snide comments about ""what if you two break up? Then you'll want item/object/whatever it was we donated/threw out/recycled"".

She criticized where our furniture went, got upset at boyfriend when he threw out my old vacuum (he was told to, by ME), rearranged things without asking, and stayed for nine days. 

I told her when we were driving back to town from the airport when I first picked her up, that she wasn't to buy us anything. Anything. If she really wanted, she could put money toward us getting groceries or a barbecue. And lo and behold, she takes my vehicle while I'm at work, finds a walmart and winners, and buys a ton of shit. Knick-knacky shit that neither boyfriend nor I want. 

Boyfriend is upset, because while he believed me when I complained, he didn't realize the extent of boundary stomping my mother likes to do. So, I sit her down, and tell her calmly ""this is boyfriend's and I's first real house together. Ware excited to decorate it in our tastes, together. We appreciate you wanting to help us, but we would like to make the decisions regarding the style of furniture/towels/knick-knacks"".

She immediately became angry, sarcastic and rude, saying I didn't appreciate her, then tried to spin it on me like I was dramatic and controlling. I ignored her for the rest of the visit. Boyfriend was a hero and drove her back to the airport with me, shutting her down whenever she got snarky.

She left, I immediately relaxed and felt much less stressed.

Now, on to the reason I've posted all this shit: while she was up visiting, my mother told me that she had spent $6000.00 on that piece of shit Ford Escape she bought in my name. 

She told me my Mazda sold for $1000.00. She then told me that I need to pay her $6000.00. 

I tried to ask her about why the amounts changed from earlier at training to now, and she became defensive. I asked her where that $1000.00 from the Mazda went, and she said other expenses related to selling the Mazda (remember, my Mazda was in good shape when I left old province for training). I told her sure, whatever. She goes back to old province, and I start to do some research.

I asked her again via text, so that I would have it in writing. I asked her why the amounts had changed. She never acknowledged that part, just stated that I owed $6000.00 (plus $200 for a grad book that had been purchased as a gift for you know, graduating training, that she was so generously now going to cover the cost of /s).

I talk with vehicle-smart guys and girls at work. I look into the average prices of Ford Escapes in new province and old province. Same with the Mazda. 

At the end of the day, the most a low km 2005 Ford Escape goes for is $4500. I don't disbelieve that my mother spent $6000.00 on the piece of garbage (she could have been suckered into it, but not my problem at the end of the day since I wasn't even remotely involved), but I'm having issues rationalizing sending her that amount when I didn't consent to her selling my Mazda, or buying the Escape. 

Anyhow, I'm at the point where I'm considering shipping the Escape back to old province. I'm intending on footing the shipping bill, and having a bill of sale filled out so it goes right into mother's name, removing the registration/insurance etc. Then buying a vehicle for myself, no mother-related strings attached.

While I've been doing my research, and considering what I should do rationally and not as a petty reaction to being frustrated with her, I've received several messages from her and my step-father. 

I have a simple rule: do not call me, I will call you. I treat every phone call like a call to arms. I live in a small town, and when my job needs all hands on deck, that's serious. I sleep in weird hours, as does boyfriend. I leave my phone volume up in case I'm need by my job. 

I have explained to family and friends: text me, asking if I can chat, and if I can, I will call you. Mother disregards this rule often, to the point where I finally got angry with her. She had called me twice in two days. The first time, I was *doing dangerous aspect of job* and could have been hurt if I checked my phone. Luckily, the people who would have called me were in front of me, so I ignored the call. Second time, I had just fallen asleep after an 18 hour shift. I was pissed. I texted her, reminding her to text and not just call immediately afterword. She sent an angry text back, saying that she was just trying to talk to me.

I got a text several days later from my step-father telling my to ""patch things up"" with my mother. I ignored him. Cause fuck that noise.

I get multiple texts from her, asking me if I’m free for a call. I don’t reply. I’m busy, as mentioned way back at the start of this whole rant. I’m frustrated, I’m hurt and I’m tired of tip-toeing around a grown woman’s feelings. She is allowed to make me feel shitty with zero consequence, but if I try to have an adult conversation with her its an attack. I’m so done with it all.

I’m sure some of you have seen other people post about that stupid Facebook guilt trip mothers have been sharing: “Just because she’s your mom and she’s going to love you forever, no matter what—you can’t treat her just any old way and think it doesn’t matter. Don’t treat the person who loves you the most…the worst. Don’t take her for granted. She may not let you see it, but your shortness, impatience and harsh words make her steal away to a quiet place and cry. Her heart hurts to understand why you seem angry with her. She will not always agree with you, but she will always love you. And it doesn’t matter how old you are, or how old she is…treasure your mom. You’ll never have another one”.

Mine shared that on Facebook. I saw red. I fucking lost it. The petty, guilt-tripping passive aggressiveness had me shredding paper, ready to hit the next person who was rude to me. (Don’t fret, I didn’t hit anyone).

This is the kind of bullshit she resorts to when she doesn’t get her way.

More of the same bullshit: I got a text this morning from step-father/flying monkey: “Hi name, please start texting your mom once a week… and call at least every two weeks”. I fixed his spelling issues and removed some identifying comments, but that’s the gist. 

I was at work when I got that message. Lucky for me (not so lucky for some other people), I got to go to a thing where I get to yell lots. (I have a weird job). I felt better after the yelling, and sent a screenshot to boyfriend. He didn’t get a chance to read it until later this afternoon, since he’s on nightshifts at the moment while I’m working days. 

I’m a 25 year old woman, a professional in a serious career field. I haven’t lived with my mother since I was 18. I am financially independent, have a loving and supportive partner, and want to be done with this manipulative bullshit.

I need help wording a polite “fuck you, fuck off, only contact me if someone I is dying” reply to them both. I need an outside perspective to make sure sending the vehicle back instead of forking over $6000.00 I don’t have just laying around is the right move. I need help! :(

Tldr: My mother ignores boundaries, is inconsiderate of people who live shift work lives, does whatever she wants, gets upset when I call her on it, and is passive aggressive, vindictive, oh, and wants me to send $6000.00 to her. Help?

"My [26F] parents [53M, 50F] completely violated my trust and shared something personal about me to my grandma [72F]. Grandma now hates me and my parents lied about how she found out; I only just found out it was them and don't know what to do.


This may say all you need to know, but I come from a staunchly conservative Catholic family. I was raised in the church and didn't ever attend a non-Catholic school until college. I ended up leaving the church and living a pretty secular life, during which time I met my boyfriend [26M]. We've been together for six years and just moved in together for the first time last month.

I'm not the first person in my generation of the family to move in with an SO, and with my cousins there was an implicit agreement among every other family member: keep it away from Grandma. I have another cousin who's been living with her boyfriend for the last year and a half, and we just don't mention it to Grandma. I knew I'd have the same deal... Or so I thought.

My grandma is my last living grandparent on both sides, and is definitely the most religious out of everyone. I had a great relationship with her anyhow, and we'd have weekly chats every Wednesday after I got off work. 

Two weeks ago, she didn't pick up the phone. Odd, but I tried again 30 minutes later in case she'd gone out. Nothing. I naturally called my mom to ask if everything was OK, and she kinda hemmed and hawed for a second before finally divulging that grandma had ""somehow"" found out about my living situation. Gma was absolutely devastated, thinks I've been seduced by the devil, and declared she wanted nothing to do with me anymore. I'm not invited to Thanksgiving anymore, and I shouldn't expect any more calls.

Obviously I was gobsmacked. I mean, I knew this would happen if she found out; that's why for years we all just didn't mention anything like that around her. Everyone else in my family is great about it, so it set off some tiny alarm bells when my mom implied it must have been another aunty or cousin who spilled the beans. I'm not really close with any of them...what would they have against me? But I also didn't really think there was reason to think my parents were involved, so I unhappily accepted it and have been sad ever since.

My brother [17M] earlier today messaged me while I was at work. He said he had to tell me the truth, and I said what about? He told me my dad was the one who told my grandma about my living situation, and that he'd been told not to tell me but that he couldn't watch them gloat over how I was moping anymore.

He also revealed to me that it's all because they're STILL salty about a tattoo I got a long time ago (age 19) against their wishes. They think it's their right to have told grandma the truth about me, and that it's finally payback for disobeying them.

I'm still just sitting here, unable to figure out how to move forward. I told my brother to just keep his wits about him and stay out of whatever happens next. He's a good kid and I don't think he's lying. We've always looked out for each other and covered each other's butts when we'd get into trouble as kids. My inclination is to not trust anyone I'm related to right now, but if there's any one of them I can trust it's him.

So here's where I get to my question: what the fuck do I do about this? For the last two weeks my parents have callously listened to me be upset about the grandma situation, knowing the whole time they were responsible - and enjoying my pain! How the hell do you respond to that kind of betrayal??

I'm lost and could really use some advice.

TL;DR: Parents purposefully destroyed my relationship with my grandma so they could get payback for something that happened years ago, in which I didn't do anything wrong. They lied about it too, and let me believe they were being supportive. I feel betrayed and don't know what to do."
"My gf(27) has cheated on me(26M) with three different coworkers over our 6 year relationship. I recently told her to move out and I feel guilty because we have a family.


I'm here because I'm too ashamed to tell anyone I know personally what I've been through. It's still pretty embarrassing to say here. 


We have a son that's 4  who will be starting school later this year. When I got with her she already had a son. He spends most of his time with his dad, but it's nice to have the two together. They're both awesome kids. Some fights here and there, but I have fun playing and seeing them get along when we're together. 


My gf and I both work full-time, so having the four of us together isn't common. I work early morning shifts and she works evenings. That alone puts strain on the relationship. I guess that's what started this ordeal. I always pictured my life with her, and the first infidelity I forgave because of these factors. It hurt, but I thought we could build something better. 


The second disloyalty coincided with a horrible incident that I thought might bring us together. These two events were about  18 months apart.  Looking back I know I was being naive, I wasn't fine and thought of my boys. Obviously she didn't, or doesn't have the same values. I'm not selfish in any way, and put those two guys ahead of my own pain. Discovering the second was traumatizing, but soon after that she suffered a loss and setback in her life. I still thought we could grow. I stayed with her. 


I've suffered from anxiety most of my life, and my lowest moments fell in line with finding her cheating. I thought I was with my soulmate and felt more comfortable with her than anyone before. Having a family is the most important thing in my life and I loved being with her. 


Earlier this year everything unraveled. Not like it was ever perfect but good enough. I expected  everyone struggles time to time. She always worked late but started staying out later. Getting drinks after shifts. Red flags all around and I find out about the third. Before this I never had seen proof of sex. But I'm reading about her talking about condoms. The first two all I found was kissing. She might have been having sex but it doesn't matter now. This time she swears, cries, promises this was just a mistake. 


At this point I kind of shut down. Days go by and I'm lost, floating through each day. I just want to be alone. I don't even want my son around. I'd go to work, she'd go, it didn't matter if we were home together. I don't tell her to leave immediately. I think about her, miss her throughout the day, and when I see her in front of me it was either resentment or longing for what was mine. She's been my best friend for so long and I just want to hang out with my friend. I'd try and talk about her cheating but the conversation always ended with her saying she loves me and wants to be with me. What I really wanted to say never came out right. 


Then one day we hung out, no kids, it was my payday. We went to a concert, joked around, ate good food, I had a great time. The next day was hanging out watching TV, laughing, nothing serious. When I wake up for work the next day I turned off my alarm set on her phone for me and see a text. Of course it's 3. I see a back and forth I love you, and that was it. I finally didn't feel anything. Felt like it was finally over and I accepted it. I tell her what I seen and she says it was a drunken mistake. More of the same. We go back and forth and now we come to an agreement that she leaves in two weeks. 


I don't know what to do, being a single dad. My son starts school soon, and I don't have any relatives around me. Her older son is with his dad and I hope we still get to hang out. She doesn't know where she's going and the car we shared is mine. To see her start over hurts, I still have love for her and think about what we could have had. I'm looking for any advice on how to get this next chapter rolling. Thank you if you read this sappy story.


TL;DR Gf cheats on me, over and over. I'm left with my son, and no more trust in anyone.

"Bf (24) keeps saying really inappropriate things to me (26) in public.


We've been together two and a half years and living together a year and a half. We tend to joke around with each other in private calling each other names, saying stupid sexual things to each other, etc. But now he's started doing this in public where there's people around and it's embarrassing and pissing me off.

One time we were out shopping and he jokingly called me a slut and something about anal. I don't remember exactly. There were like three people around that heard and I got upset and replied with something like ""why do you keep saying things like that in public?"" To which HE got mad about and said ""okay... I'll just go wait in the car."" And then didn't talk to me the rest of the day.

He'll say things about fucking me and other sexual things when there's people around (including children). I've told him to stop multiple times and it's to the point I don't want to go in public with him anywhere. He just gets mad at me for being upset.

One time we were shopping and I wanted some shirt with a pattern on it and I quietly asked him if the pattern looked like a vagina at all cuz it kind of did... He then mockingly says ""~ why do you have to say things like that in public ~ "" referring to what I said before. I'm sorry?? Asking if something looks like a vagina and saying you're going to fuck me in the ass are two comepletly different things. 

How do I get him to stop and realize what he's doing is extremely inappropriate and that it's really upsetting me?

**tl;dr** bf says sexual things in public when people are around and gets mad at me for being upset about it."
"My [38M] wife [34F] won't let me go bowling with my kids.


Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some feedback to understand better if I am overreacting or too controlling or something.

My wife \[34F\] and I \[38M\] have three little kids (5, 8, 9). Unfortunately, we have had serious marital problems for the past 18 months but are both still here and working on things (although have talked about divorce and what separating would look like). We have gone to marriage counselors on and off for about 2 years and have been going to individual counselors consistently for more one year.

We have had a number of problems that have hurt our relationship over the years and through talking and counseling I think we have at least a better understanding of them and how to fix things. Some are getting a little better, and some are not but at least we understand our differences – at least I think so.

One issue in particular which is not getting better and is a major issue for me is her prioritizing her Mom (my MIL) ahead of me and arguably our kids sometimes. My wife had a fairly traumatic childhood and I think it is now extremely codependent/enmeshed/parentified/something with her Mom. She refuses to admit any of this and thinks he childhood was ok and think her relationship with her Mom is just close and not unhealthy.

Examples of this in the past:

\- I told MIL to stop speaking trash about other family members when she was alone with our kids (this was reported to me by my daughter). She basically told me go away, she is a good grandma, she knows how to raise kids, etc. (I’m like FU they are MY KIDS. Wife stays basically silent through this.)

\- MIL speaks poorly about ALL of her other kids’ spouses.

\- My wife has way overly shared about our marital problems with her Mom and my wife recognizes this and has tempered it a little (but not fully), but I think MIL will forever think I’m a horrible person (I’m not and I’m actually a really good Dad).

\- Does not defend me when her Mom talks poorly about me for no reason.

\- Is rude to me in our home and can’t even look me in the eye.

\- MIL calls me names (e.g. asshole). She has  never apologized for any of this.

\- MIL speaks poorly about my siblings (kids uncles).

\- My wife tells me to “mind my own business” when I’m asking what she is talking to her Mom about.

\- My wife changed her phone passcode to keep “secret” txt threads with her Mom away from me where they were talking poorly about me and my parenting/etc.

\- And on and on and on.

I feel like she has more loyalty to her Mom than to me.

So the issue today, and what I’m looking for feedback on: I have no relationship with MIL. She refuses to talk to me or be in the same place as me, despite me trying to reach out several times (6!) with an olive branch to put the past behind us and lets all be friends (for our kids/grandkids sake). MIL refuses.

One marriage counselor suggested: “Fine, that is MIL’s choice, cut her out entirely until she can behave like an adult and be a good example for the kids.” I agree 100%. My wife can’t do it. In her core she can’t “cut out” her Mom, even though I honestly think the “no contact” would last about 2 weeks until MIL caved and wanted to see her grandkids again. My wife is so loyal to her Mom it is more like she is the parent and cannot “abandon” her under any circumstances.

So… as a shitty compromise, even though I don’t think it is nearly sufficient, I agreed to start to “limit” grandma to once per week to see the kids. Rather than 3-5 days per week of this toxicity. I really don’t like my kids being around someone that (a) hates me, (b) can’t talk to me or look at me, (c) doesn’t respect my very reasonable requests as a parent, and (d) can’t be with me and my kids at the same time (I’m not allowed with my kids during “Grandma time”). My kids know that Grandma doesn’t like me – and that is really shitty. I don’t want them to have to choose between Grandma or Dad

So we have this shitty “once per week compromise” in place and the kids see Grandma at her house on Saturday for several hours. But now my wife wants to take them bowling with Grandma today – 5 days later. Not a week. My wife has backpedaled on agreements like many this in the past. 

So… I said fine and I’ll come too! (I can actually take the afternoon off of work.) My wife does not want that because Grandma does not want that and for whatever reason, she can not go bowling with my family and I- I can’t be there. So my wife doesn’t want me to go. She won’t tell me what bowling alley they are meeting at.

Holy shit reddit?!?! This totally infuriates me, and my wife is an otherwise smart person, but this sad, ridiculous loyalty to her Mom is driving me crazy. Or am I overreacting and I should just let them go bowling? My kids have totally picked up on the fact that Daddy can’t do certain things or go certain places because Grandma is there and that is a big pile of poo IMO. Any thoughts?

Tl;dr: I can’t go bowling with my wife and kids because MIL will be there and she doesn’t want me there."

Here's the issue- I really want to build a mini showcase room (think like the reptile exhibit at the zoo) out of an old barn at the other end of the property. He is 100% against this. He has never liked my one chameleon, the one ""me"" pet. He gave these reasons (and I my counter-argument).

1) Reptiles serve no purpose (they're my passion and bought you half this house)

2) People will ask questions (it's my damn job, we already get questions)

3) They're in our space (they are literally five acres away from you)

4) What if you can't care for them (again, I've been in this biz for over two decades and I do this for a living, and I have at least twenty colleagues that could take my brood in)

5) It's our land, not just yours (but you have a music studio already, and I sure as heck can't hammer out a tune, nor do I go in it)

6) It would be expensive (I'm 100% paying for all of this with my discretionary income, my brother is a bang up contractor/woodworker and is offering to do the whole job on the house after I donated bone marrow+kidney to him when he was sick/AND for taking in his kids while this all went down, at a moment's notice). 

So yeah. I love the man, but I am actually disappointed. This is my dream. I support him in everything, but he doesnt support me back on this huge item. 

What should I say to him? We are 100% fine unless the menagerie comes up. 

**TL;DR** Husband won't let me build a zoo"
"My BF [31M] made me [F27] feel like a lesser person for wanting to watch a lesbian Netflix movie. Says ""that's all you think about, are you stupid? That movie won't add anything to your life.""


Okay, so we've been together for 6 years. Prior to meeting him, he knew I only dated women. We got passed that and our friendship turned into something more. Long story short we are dating for 6 years. I'm open to everybody that I have always liked women and he never cared because we're still together. In the beginning, I wasn't sure I wanted to be with him because of course he is a man and that's not what I wanted for my life. But as the years went by he showed me to be a good person and our relationship thrived.


We just subscribed to Netflix a couple of months ago and have watched a few movies together. He usually lets me pick what to watch and I usually gravitate toward food or nature documentaries, which he watches but isn't too fond of. Last week we watched a thriller one that was his pick. All good.


Then my lesbian friend came over to my house and my BF was there and we picked a lesbian movie to watch. It's romance but there was a really good life lesson in that movie which was about accepting that what makes people happy are different to what may make someone else happy.


Three days after that we sat down and watched about 6 trailers on action/thriller but didn't like any of them. So I was getting tired of picking something and went down to the lesbian section. I read some of the synopsis — they did not catch my attention until one did and I said, ""let's watch this one!""


He started yelling, saying that's all I think about and there is never anything else I want to watch aside from lesbian movies and food documentaries (which is not true, I was really trying to pick a thriller one before going to that section). He said I'm fcking alienated and extremist, asked me if I was stupid and if I can think of anything other than that. Told me to open my horizons otherwise I will go down this dark path.


He also said this affects our relationship. And that's when I was like okay, that's a valid point only if it was true, but the reality is that not once in my life he has told me it was a problem and not once we had fights over this. I love him wholeheartedly and watching lesbian movies (which I did 3 times after we got Netflix) never once made me a different person.


He asked me why I liked watching that *bullsh*t* and I said ""it's because I can relate"", just like when he sees a movie with an Asian-American engineer, he can relate to them too because he is Asian-American and an engineer. 


I felt that he made me feel terrible for enjoying lesbian movies, but I don't make him feel bad for watching thriller/action movies or slow-mo videos on youtube, you know what I mean? It's just a taste I have that is different from his. Does that mean it's wrong?


Am I pushing this too far? Should I really think about not watching lesbian movies? They entertain me and many times teach me a great life lesson. What does his thriller movie add to his life? I don't ask nor demand that each movie/video he watches ""adds something to his life.""

Any comments appreciated.

**TL;DR; : Long story short, I'm bisexual and I enjoy watching lesbian movies because I can relate. The same way my BF watches asian american movies and can relate because he is asian american. I'm not hurting the relationship, I just like to watch what I like, is that a problem?**.

"Someone stole from me [24F], how do I deal with the ""suspects""? Brother [27M], best friend [24M], GF [23F], housemate [28M] and housemate's GF [21F]


Bear with me. It's a long one.

My grandfather recently passed away, and he left me and my brother a watch, and a tin of cash each. We received about £750 each, and the watches are purely sentimental value. I was given the tin with the money on the Saturday afternoon, and was too busy to go to the bank to deposit it, and banks are closed Sunday. Between Saturday afternoon (14th) and Monday morning (16th), the cash and the tin were stolen. The tin was put in my bottom drawer on Saturday afternoon, and was not there Monday morning.

The issue is that there were a large number of people who had the opportunity to take that money, and I don't know who did it. Seeing as I don't want to drag everybody onto the Jeremy Kyle show, I'm turning to Reddit for suggestions. How do I figure out who took this money? If I have to go to the police, I will, but I would really rather not, seeing as I have no evidence.

The suspects are as follows:

My brother, Michael, 27. He was at my house on the Saturday afternoon, as we'd both received our inheritances. We hung out for a bit talking about my granddad. He only had five minutes in my bedroom alone, but I can't remember if I saw the tin after he left. I was more interested in the watch, and it'd been a long day. I don't think it'd be him, because he got his own money, but he does need money a lot more than me, as his girlfriend is pregnant.

My best friend, Daniel, 24. He came over Sunday, and had plenty of opportunity throughout the day. I told him about the money, but didn't tell him it was in my room. Daniel is wealthy as hell, and my £750 would be petty cash to him. I can't see why he would steal from me, but he would have had the best opportunity.

My girlfriend, Carrie, 23. She stayed over Saturday night, and was super quick to leave Sunday morning. She's been acting a bit off at the moment, but she doesn't really get on with my housemate. I don't think she'd steal from me. I wouldn't be with her if I did. But we've only been seeing each other for a couple of months.

My housemate, Kane, 28. He wasn't in the house until Sunday evening, and his girlfriend was with him, and they both vouch for each other. Kane's a bit weird, and has poor boundries (especially with Carrie), but he's generally pretty honest. If I didn't think he was a safe person to be around, I wouldn't be living with him.

Kane's girlfriend, Alessa, 21. I think it's her. I don't know her at all, but she really dislikes me and Carrie. But Kane swears up and down that he and Alessa were in each other's sight the whole time, and that she isn't a thief. Alessa is also super bad with money, so if she had an extra £750 lying around, she would have had her nails done, and new clothing and things to show for it, which makes me think she might not have stolen it. Also, I have no idea how she would have known about the money, or found it.

I've spoken to each of the ""suspects"". Michael and Daniel are outraged on my behalf, but have distanced themselves, Carrie is super worried that I think it was her, and is pointing the finger at Kane and Alessa. Kane seems really confused by everything, and won't comment, and Alessa has accused everybody except herself and Kane. She's even suggested that there was no money, and I'm trying to cause drama. 

Since that Monday, it's been awful. Carrie doesn't want to see me, Daniel has been avoiding me, and Alessa has been really in my face and passive aggressive about accusing her. Michael told me that it hurt him really badly to be accused of stealing from me. 

Are there any ideas or suggestions on how to figure this out before I get the police involved? And is there any point in involving the police?

TLDR: Someone stole £750. Is there a way to figure out who without going to the police? Would the police even be much use in this scenario?"
"I (40F) found out that my husband (39M) cheated on me 4 years ago while on vacation. I don't know what to do with this information.


Me and my husband are very happy together, we've been married since I was 22 years old, we have 5 kids, 16, 14, 12, 4, 4. Yes, I know, lots of kids. We wanted 3, but I got unexpectedly pregnant and it turned out to be twins. 

He had his friend from college over, this guy Carl, who he doesn't really see anymore but he still comes over occasionally to see my husband. They shared a few beers, and I went to go to sleep, but I left the door open to listen on them because Carl was telling some interesting stories that it seemed he didn't want me to hear (mostly about women hes had sex with and drugs and clubs... hes a crazy guy). I thought it was funny at the time. Hes married to some girl from Russia who is basically just as crazy as he is, they have an open relationship and have since they got married at 25. I really like both of them, but jeez, they act like they're still 21 years old. 

Then Carl mentioned to my husband ""what about that girl who you were with when we went to Mexico?"" and my husband just sighed and said that was just a little fling and he regrets it so much. I was like... what the hell? What are they even talking about? They just talked about it for a while, my husband apparently had a 'fling' with a girl from mexico while on vacation in Cancun with Carl. They were there for a week, my husband apparently slept with her twice over the span of two days.

I was mad, obviously. But he also said repeatedly that he would never, ever do something like that ever again, and that he regrets it more than anything in the world, and that he isn't ever getting as drunk as he got in Cancun ever again and all this stuff. He really put his foot down to Carl and said ""that was bad, I regret that, don't treat that like its just a little thing, I hate myself for doing that"" basically. He also kept saying that he loves me more than anything and that that was a low point in his life to betray me. 

I didn't even know what to say. It was like... just a whirlwind of emotions. It might sound weird, but I hated Carl in that moment more than my husband for acting like that wasn't a big deal. I almost felt a weird sense of pride in my husband for putting his foot down and saying that he regrets that and that Carl is being rude by acting like that isn't a big deal. But then I remembered, wait, my husband CHEATED ON ME with some young hot girl in mexico? Like what the fuck. With 3 kids at home too. I just... agh. But I also feel oddly weird, his words keep running through my head about how much he regretted it, and that he hates himself for it, and it makes me... idk, feel oddly nice that he said those things. I am just simultaneously really mad and not mad at the same time. 

What should I do? I haven't even brought this up to him, and part of me thinks I shouldn't even bring it up to him. It was 5 whole years ago that he went to Mexico. Maybe this is entirely left unsaid. 

But at the same time he did cheat. I spent a long time early on in our relationship telling myself that if he ever cheated I would dump him. But our marriage has gone up for 18 years now. We have 5 kids. We're financially successful. I don't know how to feel right now. I honestly wish I never found out. 

Tl;DR - - Husband cheated on me 5 years ago, found out by overhearing a conversation with his friend. "
"My (33F) loving husband (34M) is vehemently transphobic.


I am 33, and I have been married to my husband, James, for six years. We have a three-year old daughter together and just bought a house. Overall, it has been a successful and happy marriage so far. 

Recently, my best friend from college, Kal, came out as transgender. I have known Kal since we were both 18, and now we live close to each other. We've spent a lot of time with Kal and his wife since we've been married and I consider them both an important part of my life, as important as my family. We see them about six to ten times a year due to how busy our schedules are, but we love going to the movies and going on vacation together, too. Kal and James share a love of the Mets and watch the games together when possible. It's not uncommon to drop into his house or to come home and find him at ours. We have a friendly, easy going relationship.

When Kal came out to me, I told him how much I loved him and how much I appreciated that he told me. I started researching how to be a good friend to someone who is transitioning, as he is the first person I know who is doing so. However, when I brought it up to my husband, he exploded. I've never seen him react like this about anything before- he is an extremely liberal person who has a wide variety of friends from all walks of life. I've never heard anybody speak ill of him or say that he treated them any differently than they expected. He's a kind and loving dad and partner, which is why this was so much more difficult for me to witness.

It was awful to experience. He thinks Kal is ""selling out [his] gender"" by transitioning and speculates that there must have been some immense trauma in Kal's life to have mitigated ""such a disgusting decision"". He says that it's profoundly disturbing and that it makes him want to vomit to think of Kal having facial hair and ""cutting off [his] tits"". He told me that he would be fine with Kal presenting as a butch lesbian but that this is too radical. He sees Kal as morally damaged and embarrassing to be around, and has told me that he never wants to see them again. 

I tried to ask a lot of questions about this in an exploratory way to see if this had anything to do with his own thoughts or fears about gender or sexuality. I always saw James as comfortable in his own masculinity as he freely embraces elements of femininity without care- he paints his nails with our daughter and comments on the eyeshadow I wear with kindness and admiration and often expresses sadness that he can't wear certain items due to his size. To be honest, if he came out as queer or genderfluid, I wouldn't be surprised and I would support him. I wanted to emphasize that if that was indeed the case.

He completely denied it, said he was entirely straight and refused to discuss it further. All he would say is that he won't associate with anyone who mutilates their body like that- and the man has a bunch of tattoos! But now I'm stuck in a terrible place. I want our daughter to feel comfortable with whatever decisions she makes, and I want to know that my husband is a person I can trust and be proud of. I'm not proud of the way he is acting.

Kal has offered to speak with my husband or have his dad, who also struggled with this, meet with James so they could speak and relate to each other. He has offered books and recommended articles. I've looked into therapists. James has shut it all down and won't discuss it further. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm in between a rock and a hard place. I am having trouble separating his past goodness from his actions. I don't want to divorce him, but I also feel awful knowing that this side of him has been lurking.

**TL;DR: my loving husband was secretly transphobic and I just found out.**"
"My [29M] little brother [25M] showed up at my doorstep one day, has no intention of ever leaving


I want to preface this by saying I lived at my parents until I was 25 years old (sharing a room with my brother no less). I finished university and moved out immidiately, frankly I wanted to get away from my family and took a job 700 miles away. I finally felt like a normal human being for the first time in my life.

Then 5 weeks ago at around 9pm the doorbell rang. I didnt expect anyone so I looked out of the apartment window and see my brother down there with his luggage. He says our parents threw him out and he has nowhere to go. I was glad to see him so I said he can stay here as long as he likes (I thought that was just an expression), big mistake since he is still here and contributes NOTHING. He has no job, no outside hobbies and naturally doesnt know anyone here so he is home 24/7.

I'm in engineering so I work around 10 hours a day, when I come home the apartment looks like total crap. Dishes everywhere, his dirty clothes lying on the bathroom floor, even pee on the fucking toilet seat.

This is what I fucking ran away from and now im right back where I started. I have two sisters  (aged 32 and 33) and none of them offer any help. I can understand that since both have families of their own already but I dont think its right to dump this on me.

I feel bad already for having thoughts like this because I love him, he is my brother and we were like best friends growing up. Thats why I cant bring this up with him. I told him to get a job, to help around or just clean after himself, he does it for a day and falls right back into his old habits. He has the Austrian equivalent of a GED so there is not much he can do jobwise but I work and have no time to help him.

My relationship with my parents is strained already and I cant really ask them to take a 25 year old back can I? But why am I suddenly responsible for a grown up? I feel like there is no escaping this situation, I dont feel comfortable in my own home anymore...

*tl;dr : I took my brother in and he has shown nothing that indicates hes ever leaving*"
"Boyfriend [23M] asked me [22F] very inappropriate questions about my gay cousin [22M]. Should I end things over this?


I'm in a little shock right now. My cousin has also been my BFF since we were little babies so we're very close.

Last night my boyfriend (of 7 months) asked me some very inappropriate questions. He initially asked me if we he can ask me some questions about my cousin. I honestly thought it's basic questions to get to know him so I thought sure.

He then asked me if my cousin is a top or bottom! I was like WTF how is this any of his business and I told him that it was a very inappropriate question as it's really a very private matter. He apologized and said he didn't know as other gay people that he knows are pretty open about this. I don't buy this at all.

About 10 minutes later he asked how my cousin's ... size compares to his?! Again I was in shock. I told him the same thing as his first question, later he also asked weird questions about his masculinity and those stuff. Again I think it was very inappropriate. He asked what clubs or bars my cousin frequents and that was when I asked him to drop this conversation entirely and he did.

But I've been thinking if I took this lightly as the more that I think about this, the more I realize how incredibly creepy this was. Am I right to have red flags appear all over my mind when I rewind things in my mind?

Tldr: Boyfriend asked inappropriate questions about my gay cousin and I'm feeling it was incredibly creepy. Should I end things over this?"
"My [22M] girlfriend [22M] has become obsessed with the show 'Riverdale' and its seriously damaging our relationship.


There’s a show called Riverdale that you’ve probably heard of. It’s based on Archie Comics but it’s a lot edgier and sexier. 

My girlfriend started watching it last summer, and she quickly became obsessed. She binge-watched the whole first season in like two days on Netflix, and was excited out of her mind in the weeks leading up to season 2. I watched some of it with her just to be a good boyfriend, but CW teen dramas really aren’t my thing. She seemed disappointed I didn’t like it, but she didn’t seem angry or anything. 

Season 2 aired from last fall to late spring, and she watched it religiously. I mean she had to be in front of the TV when a new episode of Riverdale was on. We’re both in college, and more than once she left a class (even skipped an exam once) to catch the latest episode of Riverdale. It was kind of annoying because sometimes she would cancel our plans when she found out they coincided with Riverdale, but I pushed past it. 

She thinks (and apparently millions of Riverdale viewers agree) Cole Sprouse is the sexiest man on earth. As someone who watched the Suite Life of Zack and Cody as a kid, I find that odd, but anyways.

No guy likes to know his girl is thinking about another guy, but at least it was someone famous and not someone she could realistically cheat on me with. But it still made me uncomfortable. Like sometimes I’d be sitting on the couch screwing around on my laptop or reading or whatever while she watched Riverdale, and when Cole Sprouse’s character (Jughead) came on screen she’d do that thing where she fans herself and get this huge, beaming smile on her face. Whenever Jughead kissed his girlfriend (Betty) she’d squeal and say that the actress who played Betty was so lucky.

She also started (and still does) patterning her speech after the characters on the show. There’s a character named Cheryl who’s a huge bitch, and now I’m starting to hear her lines (or lines similar to hers) coming out of my girlfriend’s mouth. 

She references Riverdale constantly. Maple syrup plays a pretty big role in the show (don’t ask) and every time I pour maple syrup or we pass it in the aisle at the store she makes a Riverdale joke. 

At one point, she wanted to dye her hair red to look more like Cheryl Blossom, but I managed to talk her out of that one.

I honestly can’t take Riverdale talk anymore. A few weeks ago I sat her down and asked her if she could please talk about Riverdale a little less, for my sake. She agreed without much argument, but she seemed so wounded I felt bad. She did talk about it less (though still too much for my tastes, honestly), but at this time she also started becoming more introverted and spending more time on the computer. 

It got to the point where she barely wanted to leave our apartment anymore, and we had sex a lot less than we used to. I’ll be honest; I started to get worried she was cheating on me. I’m very paranoid about that, due to an incident in HS. She rarely went out, so I didn’t think she was meeting anyone, but maybe she was corresponding with someone online. 

I considered snooping, but I would have felt awful, so finally I confronted her about it. I asked her why she was spending so much time on her computer. I asked if she was depressed or anxious, and she said no. Finally, I asked ‘you’re not speaking to anyone else, are you?’

She knows my paranoia surrounding that and she didn’t get as mad as I thought she might. She promised she would never cheat on me, and so I asked her what she was doing on the computer so often.

She said she didn’t want to tell me because she knew I was sick of Riverdale, but she told me she’d been talking with her new online friends (other Riverdale fans) and writing and reading Riverdale fanfiction. She showed me one of her fanfictions about Betty and Jughead. It was almost 83,000 words long, and still counting. That was one of many. She also showed me some of her favorite fanfiction stories that other people had written. I was honestly kind of horrified. I asked, gently as I could, if spending that much time online reading and writing could really be healthy. I pointed out that she was looking a little pale and sickly lately, since she didn’t go out as much. She got offended and told me she never tried to tear me away from my hobbies and interests, which to be fair, is true, but my hobbies and interests also don’t put me inside for the vast majority of the day. 

We had a little fight, but it wasn’t too bad. Still, I was starting to get anxious. She rarely wanted to go out and do anything fun anymore, and had started rewatching Riverdale on Netflix. And every time I saw her sitting on her computer clicking away, I got a little creeped out knowing what she was doing. 

A few weeks ago, I found her crying, and I asked her what was wrong. She wouldn’t tell me at first, but when I pressed her, she told me there was some kind of drama in the Riverdale fan community because somebody had plagiarized someone else’s fanfiction or something. I was torn between comforting her and telling her this was fucking ridiculous. 

It all came to a head three days ago.

We were about to have sex, which I was glad about, since we didn’t do it as much as we used to. But she wanted to do a little roleplay. She asked me to wear a leather jacket like Jughead does in the show. I finally snapped.

I said that, no, this was ridiculous, and frankly I couldn’t handle it anymore. We got into our first real fight in a long time, and a whole lot of pent up frustration and anger came out. Finally I just left our apartment, fuming. 

I haven’t spoken to her since then. She tried to call me all that night, but I was pissed to answer, and when I calmed down by the next day, she wouldn’t answer.

I’m at a friend’s house, sad, angry, and just confused. All this over a fucking TV show. I miss the girl I got together with two years ago who liked to rock climb and hike and go out for drinks sometimes. I don’t want this relationship to end. I love her. But I just can’t take this anymore. I don’t want to deny her her own interests, but this has gone beyond an interest. It’s consuming both our lives.

What do I do? What can I do? Is this relationship salvageable? Is this symptomatic of some other underlying problem? Should I try to talk to her parents? Her friends?

Please help. 

TL:DR my girlfriend has become so obsessed with the show Riverdale, and with writing and reading Riverdale fanfiction and participating in the fandom, that she barely has time for anything else, and it’s tearing our relationship apart.

"My (19F) boyfriend (19M) is getting made fun of at work because of me. Not sure how to approach this.


I've been with my boyfriend for a little more than a year. I love him so so much, he is absolutely one of the greatest people I've ever met. He's so kind and compassionate, extremely smart, and to me, very attractive. Our relationship is strong and we are usually very good at communicating. 

However, I've just recently just learned that my boyfriend is getting relentlessly made fun of at his new job. About a month ago, he started a new job at this tech company. They usually don't higher undergrads but since he had such an impressive resume, they hired him. So I would say he's probably the youngest at his job right now, most of the other guys are early to mid-twenties (recently graduated or grad students). 

My boyfriend is very attractive to me. He's a bit lanky and awkward and has messy hair (I think it's really cute) so he's definitely not your conventionally attractive dude. But my friends say he's cute and I agree, but I digress. So the other day, one of my friends who's a grad student who also works at the company, asks to meet up at a Starbucks saying that she had something to tell me. 

She tells me that my boyfriend is getting made fun of at work. A group of guys who work around him apparently think that I'm way out of his league and that ""a guy like him doesn't deserve a girl like me"". According to my friend, they constantly pester him during the day, saying comments like, ""dude, you should break up with her so I can date her"" or ""you're way too ugly for her"" or ""where can I get a girl that only looks at my personality. Or better yet, where do I get a blind girl?"". Those are just some of the examples. Apparently some guy even printed out a picture of me that he found online and framed it to put on his desk to piss my boyfriend off. He's been joking around telling everyone that I'm his girlfriend now. 

My friend also told me that she has already talked to my boyfriend about it (pulled him aside during break one day). He said that it's fine and that he doesn't mind it \*that\* much. When she asked why, he said that one of the guys saw his lock screen on his phone, which is a nice picture of us, and flipped his shit. That's how the teasing began. According to my friend, my boyfriend at first, reciprocated and told them off, but now has taken to ignoring them when it happens. But today, she told me that she saw one of the guy wack him on the head because he was ignoring something they said. What the fuck?

I am livid! How could they do this? They are guys in their twenties, not 16-year olds! However, my boyfriend has not told me about this at all, not even a peep. He acts like everything is normal. I only found out today and it's been going on for three weeks. I don't know if I should bring this up with him, or how I should bring this up with him. Maybe he just wants to deal with it himself and I should stick out of it but I am so so angry. 

How should I approach this situation?

TL;DR: My sweet, kind boyfriend is being made fun of at his new job because apparently, he's too ugly to date me. Today, it's resorted to physical violence. I heard all of this from my friend, who also works at the company. My boyfriend has not said a single thing to me. Not sure how I should bring it up with him or even if I should. How to approach this?"
"New roommate [26M] warned me [23F] about long-term boyfriend [30M].


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for over 2 years, and we recently moved in a mutual friend we’ve both known for about a year. We all seem to get along pretty swimmingly and on a couple occasions, have taken part in deeper, meaningful conversations both sober and while drunk - conversations about each of our futures and prospective jobs, personal shortcomings and even relationship expectations. 

To give backstory on our new roommate, most of the women I know have a crush on him for good reason. He’s a genuinely good-hearted, good-looking professional although he’s told me that he’s been somewhat involved with a lot of women/led them on in my opinion. 

With that said, he has made comments both to me separately and in front of my boyfriend that I am a “quality, commitment-type girl” or that I am “the best my boyfriend can ever hope to do”. He never misses an opportunity to encourage and compliment me or just generally be nice (Read: he has never crossed the line or made me uncomfortable/ will ask me how my day was, compliment my new haircut, or encourage me before a big test; unfortunately things my boyfriend fails to do).

With that said, they came home one morning talking about sexual expectations in relationships, thinking I was asleep in another room. I listened as my boyfriend described me as a “rare breed”, but went on to say that he would be interested in a polygamous relationship with other women, despite knowing I’m not interested in other men or the idea of sharing what constitutes a committed relationship with other women. I feel like I should also note here that my boyfriend and I have successfully partaken in multiple threesomes without any repercussions (thanks to good communication + respect of boundaries). Clearly, this desire of his called for a private conversation so I got up and attempted to speak to him privately. 

My boyfriend was insistent on continuing what should have been a private conversation in front of our roommate, almost as if getting support from our male roommate would persuade me.  My boyfriend started saying that I “knew what I was getting into from the beginning that [polygamy] is what he wanted”, that he wants to develop a system where I “vet” girls to sleep with him, but the most confusing: he kept insisting he wanted me to have his babies during all of this.

I clearly was getting upset and cited that my boyfriend had never expressed a desire for polygamy to me, and started questioning where this was coming from. I honestly thought it was some twisted joke he transpired to get a reaction out of me. I’m clearly uncomfortable so I leave and insinuate that our roommate should not have been present, despite the fact that he told my boyfriend he was being ridiculous for wanting so much when I already provide more than the average woman in a committed relationship.

Ironically, my boyfriend entered our bedroom as I was upset, saying how much he loves me and “can’t wait to have babies with me”, but the discussion really ended there.

Days later, my roommate approached me and blatantly said he doesn’t think my boyfriend respects me and that he fully believes that he will knock me up and cheat on me in the near future. That he has this ideation that he will “damage” me for other guys by knocking me up, and he won’t have to worry about me leaving him/finding another partner if I have his children. He went on to say that my boyfriend is one of those people who is “always looking for the next best thing” and has only “claimed me so that other men don’t have the opportunity”. 

I was devastated and brought this up to my boyfriend. He was offended that I don’t “trust” him, that I would think he would ever do that, and blamed me for being insecure, and said my roommate probably just wants to sleep with me.

Reddit, how do I handle this?

tl;dr Roommate told me long-term boyfriend was planning on cheating. Boyfriend says roommate wants to sleep with me. Not sure who to believe.

"I [23M] was I interested in my SO [22F] because she seemed really mature. Six months in she's still a great person but incredibly childish and asks for so much attention from me. I don't really think we're meant for each other.


 Okay.

First a bit background about me. I'm employed in IT and work A LOT. I have shitton of responsibilities as some of the people who worked here for so long quit. I now have to work for 12 hours pretty much every day to show clients that we can do without them (we're consultants, an outsourcing firm).

I am also an introvert. I don't like hanging out with people really often. I'm fine with going out from time to time, but I really need my alone time every other day.

When I and my SO wanted to go official I have tried to set her expectations straight because of my work: I will not be available 24/7, she should not expect going out every single day, there might be days/weeks where we don't see each other etc. She was perfectly fine with this. And I loved this. She seemed really mature and understood that we don't need to see each other ALL THE TIME to work - it's quality over quantity.

Plus we work together, on the same floor so we see each other all the time (grabbing a smoke, coffee, lunch etc). Also we have a 1-hour break and we usually go together, sometimes alone but sometimes with other people.

To summarize all of this - I'm really focused on my career, in both work and my free time (studying new things etc), so noone should expect that I'm available all the time. 

Six months in - this is going really bad. She has issues with all the things I told her about: us not going out together often, talking about my ex, etc. Also whenever she's mad she doesn't want to talk with me. She also doesn't like to ""talk things out"", rather keep them out there until she gets over them.

She also likes to play word games, which I hate so much. She'd say one thing but mean another and expecte to get it. Example: we were in a fight and she said she didn't want to go out with me. After ten minutes of trying to change her mind I said fine, I'll give you your space but we have to talk about this. When she got home she texted me that she ""was disappointed that I didn't go after her and made her go out with me"". I was stunned. I hate these sort of things. I'm so busy with all of the stuff going on in my life that I really don't want playing fucking games with someone and reading someone's mind.

Funnily enough, this was exactly the reason why I broke up with my ex, hence why I wanted to set things straight in the beginning. All of the things I thought that she's not - she is. And I can't live like this.

We're fighting a lot about these things. I really like her as a person though - she's into same things as I am, we share a bunch of interests, but I just can't handle these silly games and meaningless fights.

Was anyone in a similar situation? She's a great human being and when we're not fighting things are AWESOME, but in all other times... Sigh.

*TL;Dr*: I thought my gf would be more mature but she's not. I work long hours and have so many responsibilities that I just don't have time to attend to her every day. She has problems with this, even though we talked about it. She also acts like a child when in argument (doesn't want to talk to me etc) and she expects from me to read her mind. I can't go on like this, but I still really like her as we have a lot of things in common.. I've no idea what to do."
"My (30f) husband (30m) of 6 years has a coworker (39ish?F) who he calls his ""work wife."" I think it almost approaches emotional affair, but I know nothing physical. However, he is a much happier, more loving person towards me. Do I just swallow my jealousy and let him be?


submitting from a throwaway since I'm not sure I want this to bleed into my ""normal"" reddit life. 

Marriage is happy and healthy but we are coming out of a long period where we were on a razors edge. Our daughter (one know) was born with pyloric stenosis and she literally vomited and screamed for the entire first year of her life, there were times when we seriously thought we were going to lose her. My husband and I were at each others throats from sheer lack of sleep and stress. Thank you to an amazing set of pediatricians, a patient hospital staff and an endowment by a billionaire (who people usually hate, but he saved my daughters life) my daughter was able to have the appropriate surgery and we are putting pyloric stenosis in the rear view mirror. 


But right after that my husband ran into some serious problems with his coworker, it got so bad that this coworker was actually threatening to sue me for sexual harassment (longer story than we have time for here), beat my husband in the parking lot, and sue the company for things like my husbands choice of deodorant. We had 1.5 years of absolute hell that only ended when things got so bad with the coworker that HR could no longer ignore it and he was fired and actually sued by the company for defamation for things he posted on social media. That lawsuit will take years but for the most part we are done with that too. 


However, the scars from that 1.5 years still linger and we are starting to like each other again. We both said some terrible things to each other because of all the stress but I feel like we are moving back to normal. 


So the latest curve ball, if you can even call it that because I just may be overly sensitive, is that my husband has a new coworker named ""Irene."" She took over directly for the co-worker that was fired so they share the same office, they are partners on 90% of their projects. I've met Irene several times and she's a woman in her late 30s, she is super bubbly, she isn't what I would call attractive, but she has a super charming and engaging personality. My husband enjoys her company so much that they eat lunch together every day (I'd say 1/2 days a week they invite me and my daughter and Irene is like an amazing aunt and my daughter lights up when she sees her). Irene is new to town so she's been over to eat dinner with us and she's had us over to cook for us. Irene has a 13 year old daughter and I've actually picked her up from school and the daughter is engaging, sweet, polite and really wants to baby sit for us.


But the issue I'm having is that this has all happened so fast (and I freely admit I've been happy to be a part) but now my husband has taken to calling Irene his ""work wife"" and he'll joke about how I'm his ""ball buster"" at home and she's his ""ball buster"" at work. I know after all the crap he went through with his past coworker, he is so happy to have Irene there because not only is she friendly, she's a great worker and it's helping him be way more productive. 


But as much as I've approved of his relationship with Irene, I am starting to get jealous of her. I have no reason whatsoever to think that anything physical is happening, in fact, my husband being happier has meant that our sex life is actually approaching or exceeding what it was before the 1.5 years of absolute hell and I can't imagine him having any more energy for another person. 


But I'm jealous non the less, I'm not saying this is rational but it is how I feel.  But I don't want to ruin the great thing my husband has going (in fact we all have going) because I'm having an irrational thought process. 


Should I just bury my jealousy to admit things are better when he's happy? If he's happy because of Irene, so be it?


TL;DR: my husband and I went through 1.5  years of absolute hell due to our daughters health issues and then a miserable experience with his co-worker. He now has a new co-worker who he calls his ""work wife."" She has been amazingly sweet and my husband is much, much happier, so much so that it's improving our relationship. But I'm jealous of her and don't know what to do. Should I just bury my feelings because things are so much better now?

"My [15M] mum [47F] was going to be allowed to see me if she stayed out of trouble. She was caught with Meth in her system yesterday and I just don't know anymore.


My life before I turned 9 was not easy. I grew up in a very low income area. My dad is in jail and is not getting out until I'm 30, That's if they decide to have mercy on him. I haven't seen him and I really don't want to see him, My mum got addicted to drugs after dad was arrested. I was taken away by the government from them. I've lived with Danny and Jordan for 6 or 7 years now. Danny and Jordan in terms of relation are my guardians. As to who they are, Jordan is a distant cousin with his wife, Danny. They're 39 and 36, I think. Danny looks like she's in her early twenties, so I always think she's younger than she is. I've been living with them for 6 or 7 years. I live in a nice house, nice school. Way better than what I had it. 

The story with my mum is that she would have been allowed to see me with a  Jordan and government worker there. The government and Jordan don't want me being alone with her. It was something we worked out a while ago. I've heard things about her. I heard at one point she was high in park somewhere. I hate using dad as an excuse, but that's the excuse people like to peddle out for her, She was always into this shit. Just not this bad. Anyway, uesterday, Danny was being super nice. She always is, but more than usual. She broke the news to me that they've had to call off the lunch with my mum. 

The government wanted to do a test with her to see if she was sober. It's also to do with the police thing she has to go to. I think it's probation or something. I really don't know. I don't really know what's been going on with her since I was put into other people's care. She broke the agreement they had. They government won't let her anywhere near me because of it.

I was suppose to see her this weekend. And I don't just fucking know anymore. Thank god I had to go to the doctor at lunch time today. There's this one kid that just annoys the fuck out of me, He's not a bully, he's just annoying. He hisses at you to be quiet if you make the slightest noise in class. I was so close today he was pissing me off that much before I left. I am in a very annoyed mood, but I'm mostly sad. I don't know I wanted to see her, I just did. 

Danny and Jordan got into a fight last night over this. Danny was angry that Jordan even suggested it because she knew this would happen. Jordan actually had to sleep in the guest room she was that angry. I tried to help, but she told me to say out of it because they're suppose to be looking after me. This whole thing has caused so much tension and headache. 

**TL;DR:** I was suppose to see my mum this weekend, but she was caught with Meth in system. The government wants her no where near me because of it. My guardians are fighting because one of them didn't want it to begin with. I'm just sad because I was this close to seeing her after all these years, but I just don't know anymore."
"[35F] had birth control complication that cost a lot, I’m asking [40M] to pay half but he’s thinking it over


Together over 2 years, plan to move in together in two months. Boyfriend makes 3x what I make and I personally would struggle to pay the bill since it was unexpected, so my friends suggested I ask him since it should not just be on the me to foot the cost for birth control.

Basically I had a major complication with my IUD getting imbedded into my uterus. I’m doing okay and recovered quickly after getting it removed. Insurance covered a lot for the procedure, but I’m on the hook for $600. 

I talked to a few friends who said I should ask boyfriend to pay half, since birth control benefits both of us. I asked him last night and he’s now thinking it over. He says he’s tell me in 1-2 days.

I feel disappointed that he did not agree right away, especially since in our 2 years I’ve never asked him to help cover any birth control costs and also because we were moving toward long term by moving in together, so expected a response that was more aligned with wanting to help me out, since we should be in this together. He’s expressed financially we will work it out so we can live together since i make les than he does and he lives in a higher cost of living area which is move to, so I’m a little confused by his response.

Should I be concerned here that he’s not willing to help me out after hearing my reasons? Or he just needs time to process what I’ve said? Disappointed and scared too, that I’ll be left to deal with ‘woman’s problems’ on my own and in the future when it comes to birth control.

tl;dr: Boyfriend is thinking over if he should pay for a unexpected bill related to birth control. Should I be concerned here that he’s not willing to help me out? Or he just needs time to process what I’ve said?

"Is my live-in fiancée [30F] right to want to get rid of perfectly-good, useful home appliances that I [26M] purchased with my ex-girlfriend [29F]?


Hello Reddit,

I've been with my fiancée over two years. We've lived together for one year, and have been engaged for seven months. Our wedding will be in January.

I am a systems analyst and my fiancée is a substitute teacher for elementary schools. She used to work three or four days a week (as a substitute teacher, she couldn't always get a job every day, Monday through Friday) and live with a roommate. Since we've started living together, and especially after we got engaged, she works generally one or two days a week as I do most of the supporting. Our long-term plan is that after we have children, she will be a stay at home mom. With her larger amount of free time, she generally takes care of the apartment and writes a self-published blog.

Okay, so my issue is that my ex-girlfriend, whom I was with for about a year and a half, also used to live with me in my apartment. We broke up on good terms after she came out as a lesbian (ouch, LOL) and we remain casual friends. She is now in a long-term relationship with a much older woman; I believe she is in her fifties. My fiancée knows about my former relationship and has met my ex on a few occasions around town.

Well, when my ex lived with me, I purchased several, expensive, high quality home appliances and products that we both used. Such as a cappuccino maker, a blender, a toaster, washing machine and dryer, fancy kitchen knives, etc. Altogether, these items represent several thousands of dollars.

When my ex and I broke up, even though I was the one who spent the money on the items, I asked her if she'd like to take anything with her when she moved out. She asked only for the Keurig coffee maker, which I replaced soon after she left with a similar machine.

My fiancée doesn't know exactly every single item in my apartment that I bought while I was still with my ex girlfriend, and up until recently, she appeared to have no issue in the slightest if she was using a machine that my ex had also been using.

For example, my fiancée loves the cappuccino maker, and so did my ex.

Well a couple of weeks ago when I come home from work, my fiancée asks me about every single appliance I have at home, and whether or not I purchased it when I was still with my ex. I thought it was a bit weird for her to ask me, but I played along and told her honestly which items I bought when me and the ex were still together.

My fiancée then told me that we needed to get rid of all these items.

I asked why, as these items are all high quality machines that cost a lot of money, and what's more, they're all in brand new condition.

My fiancée explained that she just doesn't feel comfortable using appliances that my ex touched. I said I understood, but also pointed out that she had been using the items for months now, and had no problem with them before.

She didn't want to discuss it further but just said that I needed to get rid of the items.

I honestly don't want to throw the items out, as they're all still good, nor do I want to give them away, and if I tried to sell them on Craigslist or Ebay, there's no chance I could get even a quarter of what I paid for them.

I make pretty decent money, but I don't like the idea of buying new appliances. I'm the sort of person who doesn't care much for brand names, but I do care about quality and making things last, hence I'll spend a couple of hundred dollars on a really good appliance that will last twenty years, versus the cheapest possible items at Walmart that might break down after a few months.

I don't get why my fiancée wants to get rid of the items all of a sudden. Even though I am not enemies with my ex, it's not like I ever talked her up or made her look like this amazing person to my fiancée. The only times I ever mention my ex is in direct, short answer to my fiancée's questions about her (my fiancée, on the other hand, is still Facebook or real-life friends with a couple of her exes, and I don't mind at all).

A couple of days after my fiancée told me I needed to get rid of all my old appliances, suddenly she is more sexual than usual. We'll usually do it three times a week, four times a week because I'm at work so much, but lately my fiancée wants to do it pretty much every day, and she's more aggressive than before, more vocal, louder. It's cool, but strange and unexpected compared to her former behavior. I'm not complaining about the sex, but at the same time I don't understand the sudden change.

Hoping Reddit can give me some advice and insight.

Thanks!

\_\_TLDR; fiancée wants for me to get rid of every appliance I purchased while I was still with my ex. Is this a reasonable request?\_\_"
"My wife [58M] SIL [28M] passed away last week. My daughter [29F] thought it would be best for their kids [3M &amp; 5F] to have a private funeral before the traditional one. My wife [60F] is sticking her nose where it doesn't belong and she's making this about her.


Good Afternoon, my name is John. My son in Law, David, passed away last week. It was very sudden. I saw him maybe 3 hours before he died. It's been very tough on our daughter. She and David were together for 9 years when they met at university. The kids are devastated. I don't think my grandson understands what is going on. He has an idea, but I don't think he can really comprehend what happened.

My wife is the main issue here. My wife works with children for a career, and when she found out about David's passing she wanted to tell the children, because she thought she was the most qualified to do it. Our daughter refused and said she must be the one to tell them what was going on. My wife kept pushing which almost resulted in our daughter slapping her. David's father and my daughter told me they had a plan of what to do with the kids. They thought that a funeral may be a bit distressing for the kids with everything going on around them. So what they're doing is just doing a small private service for the kids to say goodbye, and then on the day of the actual funeral they'll leave the kids with a family member or a sitter. I said I would take the kids on the day of the actual funeral and attend the small family service. 


My daughter is thinking of the kids. My wife is trying to convince my daughter that it's a bad idea and how her idea for the funeral is better. We're talking down to the minute details of what flowers to get. She wants the kids to be at the actual funeral. No matter what I say my wife thinks she's right. 

**TL;DR:** Wife is sticking her nose where it's not wanted when it comes to the kids and funeral preparation. How do I get her to stop pissing off our daughter? When my wife get's like this, it's her way or the high way. It can't be like that this time."
"I [23 F] am getting more muscular, and my boyfriend [29 M] doesn't find it attractive. Problem is, I love my new body.



I've been doing a sport since college, but a while ago, I felt like my skills had plateaued. My coach said that what he thinks is holding me back was just that I was lacking physical strength. He suggested I start lifting weights. 

I thought he was right, I was really tiny and non muscular. I've always been bordering on being underweight, dipping above and below the cutoff for years. So I started going to the gym a few times a week, and making myself eat more to put on some muscle.

I also coincidentally started a new job that's close enough to home that I can bike there. It's kind of a hilly ride, so doing that every day did wonders for my legs.

I've super happy with how I look and feel. While it hasn't been a drastic change, going from 103 to 120 pounds, I've made so much improvement in my sport, I feel great and energetic rather than easily tired all the time, and I love how my legs and butt look.

My boyfriend knew I was really excited about this. For the first time, I was able to lift him up. I kept telling him about how much improvement I was making at my sports practices.

----

My friend was telling me at a party that her boyfriend who she just broke up with wasn't able to lift her up, and he called her heavy, and she felt super hurt by that. My best drunk idea to cheer her up was to lift her up and yell ""girl he's just weak"" and then do a few squats holding her. She was laughing her ass off, and a bunch of my other friends who we were talking to laughed about it. One of our friends joked about how I should go fight her ex.

My boyfriend confronted me about that a few minutes later, saying that me showing off was super unattractive and tacky, and he was embarrassed by it. I told him ""Literally everyone but you was laughing, it was just a bit of fun. Anyway I wanted to make my friend realize she's skinny as fuck and her ex was just an ass."" 

I asked him to name one other person who found it cringy, and he couldn't. So I asked him why he was so bothered.

It all came out then; he said he found it unfeminine, and he'd not been as attracted to me, once I started getting fit. He said he didn't like how my body wasn't as soft anymore. And seeing me squat my friend today reminded him too much of the ""macho bullshit"" a lot of men do, that he hates and thinks is super trashy. 

I was shocked by all that, and I was kinda upset that he preferred me before. I was drunk so I probably got too accusing, but I said ""It's really shitty that you preferred me weaker. I feel so much better now, able to do so much more. My doctor isn't telling me I'm underweight anymore. But you don't like that?"" 

-----

I think we need to talk again sober. But I don't know how to approach it. I'm still upset my boyfriend thinks I'm less attractive, after I've made a change that feels so amazing for me. 

TLDR - My boyfriend told me that he doesn't find me as attractive since I put on some muscle. It hurts to hear he preferred me weak and medically underweight.

"""love of my life"" (25m) dumped me (24f) 3 months ago. I'm heartbroken but finally dealing. Nos he's dating a girl that looks like me, does the same job as me and has similar hobbies. It's like the wound is fresh again. How do I deal with this?


Posting from a throwaway for pretty obvious reasons I suppose. 

Some background is for sure in order here. I was dating ""Kevin"" for almost 3 years. I know we were young but I was truly, truly in love with him and I thought he loved me as well. I thought we were being patient but taking all the necessary steps to stay together forever. 

In mid April, Kevin took me to dinner and to be totally honest the way he asked, I thought that he was going to propose and I was going to have to very awkwardly tell him that while I loved him with my whole heart and I did want to marry him ""someday"" but now was not the time for this as I still want to get my MSN and that was my focus. 

Well it turns out I was completely wrong and he ended up dumping me in the middle of a the restaurant. I was physically ill, I threw up in the bathroom, I cried my eyes out, I had to call my best friend who helped me get home. Basically I was in such shock that night I didn't even ask him why. Over the course of the next week I did all of the typical ""dumped"" girl thinks, I begged him to take me back, I tried to rock his world with sex (that's so humiliating looking back), I promised him I'd change, I would quit my MSN program and devote all my time to him. During that week I found out that his reason for dumping me was that he felt like in dating me for ""so long and while so young"" that he felt like he'd sacrificed any variety he needed to experience. During that week it still didn't phase me and I still tried everything to get him back. I think maybe 9 days after the breakup it finally occurred to me that he wasn't taking me back no matter what and I resolved myself to not contacting him, moving on, and trying to start over. 


All of that is harder said than done because I've lost 11 pounds, I still cry almost every day, I tried Tinder and bail out of really promising guys at the last minute because I think of all the ways they aren't Kevin. Basically, I'm dealing with this...but I'm not doing a good job. I had not seen or heard from Kevin since late April which if nothing else, was a good sign that I was moving on. 


Then earlier this week I went out to dinner with my mom and dad. I saw Kevin's very distinctive walk as he was holding the door for another girl. I was of course super curious and when I got a good look at her I was pretty shocked that she had a very similar appearance to me. Medium build, medium height with dark hair and blue eyes. My stupid dad (I love him to death, but dear god Dad) said something like that looks like Kevin over there! And actually called him over to our table. Kevin and my dad always got along great so Kevin very awkwardly complied and came over with his date. I was polite but cold and Kevin introduced us to his new ""friend"" as he called her. It was as awkward as you can imagine even thought they were at the table for maybe 30 seconds. My dad asked why he hadn't seen Kevin around, my mom chastised him for being the densest man on earth and I did my best to hold back an absolute explosion of tears. 

I got home from dinner, called my best friend and told her that I saw Kevin. She said that she knew from mutual friends that he was dating a new girl but he hadn't seen or met her yet. I told her how it really sucked because Kevin had broken up with me for ""variety"" and the girl basically could have been my cousin. She told me that well that wasn't all, the new girl was also a nurse and also into running as her main hobby. I was like seriously what in the fuck, he basically replaced me with me. 


So his thing about variety was total bullshit, but the thing that sucks is I feel more rejected than I did when he actually broke up with me. I feel like since variety was utter nonsense, he actually did like my attributes but just didn't like ME. I've spent the last few days crying more than normal and just feeling like absolute garbage because I can't even compete with people who are just like me. 

Basically, in addition to everything else...how in the hell do I deal with this? 

I'm so lost and so sad and feel like nothing will ever be ok again. I know that's dramatic but with the exception of my grandparents dying, I've never known heartbreak like this. 


tl;dr: my ex boyfriend is dating a girl that looks very similar to me, has the same job as me and has similar hobbies. I was finally dealing with the break up by admitting it was real but I got to see and technically meet her earlier in the week and now it feels like the wound is fresh all over again because he didn't reject me for ""variety,"" he rejected me for someone very similar to me. How do I deal with this?

"Daughter [16F] is a streamer and gets her fair share of creepy comments. I [47M] am a bit freaked out and don't know what to think or do about it.


She streams on different several platforms (Twitch, YouTube, etc) and she's been gaining a bit of a fanbase, which has grown a lot in the past few months. She vlogs, plays videogames, talks about her hobbies and does short ""documentaries"" on things she is interested in. She is starting to make money out of it and while I wasn't too pleased about it at first because she doesn't seem to want to go to college, I can see that she really likes it and I'm happy for her.

But, she also gets quite a few creepy comments. Comments about her and her body. Some clearly come from guys who mean well and are trying to tell her they think she's cute but others are outright creeps who write some pretty explicit stuff, ask her personal information.

Initially I didn't check on her videos a lot and only saw them when she showed them to me but sometimes I would scroll down and read a few comments. After a while I started noticing some comments bordering on the creepy side and a few shameless ones that are most likely just looking for a reaction, but still freak me out that she's receiving all of this, totally unfiltered.

I talked to her and she says ""yeah, every youtuber deals with creepy users"", and doesn't seem too bothered about it.

I don't know if it's just me or is she underestimating the risk this can bring upon her? I mean, she is starting to receive mailed gifts. It's not our own address that she uses, but it has me a bit worried about people being more and more aware of the general location of our home and what it could mean in the future.

I don't know if *I* am worrying too much, or if she's worrying too little, or what, you know? Is she getting *even more creepy* private messages that I don't know about? That also bothers me.

We live only with each other and I am little freaked out by all of this, and have no idea what the next step should be, or how to handle any of this. I admit I am still a bit shocked that she is a bit of a public figure, so that may be part of the problem, or not, I don't know.

Do you have any advice for me?

**tl;dr:** Daughter streames and gets a few creepy messages. This coupled with the fact that people are becoming more aware of where she lives is really creeping me out and I don't know if it's warranted or not. Any advice on how to handle this?"
"Me(31M) and her(27F) called off the wedding three weeks before it was set to happen. Now what?


Throw away account.

Me - 31M

Her - 27F

We've been together three years. Had our normal ups and downs throughout the relationship but always remained solid. When we first met I was in the process of buying my first flat. After one year together (previously we lived together in a rented flat) we moved in and things got a bit tough. We started reconstructing the flat, dealing with contractors, watching my budget and the stress slowly started to set in. After almost one year of that we went on a much needed one month vacation.

It was perfect. We talked about marriage, spending our lives together and I knew she was the one. Four months later I bought the ring and proposed. This was in November of last year. She comes from a very small family, just her and her mom. So she immediately wanted to elope. I was against it as I come from a bigger family and I wanted at least my closest family members there. Eventually we agreed to do a smaller classic wedding but I  could feel she was hesitant as her father wouldn't be there to walk her down the isle. Still I pushed her more than I should and eventually she agreed with it and things started rolling. As things progressed the wedding got bigger, 60 people and it got more expensive. I started to get stressed as I had to pay for the wedding bands, catering, venue, alcohol, etc. I started to stress out as I was forced to count every penny each month to make sure that I had enough to not only pay the mortgage, bills, reconstruction but also everything for the wedding. The number one biggest stress factor was that my mom, brother and his family bought flight tickets to attend the wedding so we felt like we were cornered and the wedding was locked in no matter what. 

If it wasn't for the fact that my family wasn't flying in we would have easily said hey lets wait another 6-12 months. Still we continued on with the wedding planned for mid July. In April she quit her job and did a career change and started working at a new company in May. For that first month everything is normal. We talk, text and communicate daily. She tells me about the job everything is normal. 5 weeks before the wedding we pick up the wedding bands and she's super excited and wearing hers at home. 

Then a week later she goes away one night on a conference that the company organizes once per year. She comes back and I immediately notice a difference. Distant, texting less, something just feels off. I figure its cold feet so I leave her alone for several days. After 4-5 days I ask her what's going on. It finally comes out that she wishes she could postpone the wedding. Her main reasons are the last year was stressful with the flat, we didn't do much because of tight finances and the wedding got to big. I get pissed as its a bit late to say this and pretty selfish as we're 4 weeks away from the wedding and my family is arriving in 3 weeks. Over the next week we start to argue, she checks out more and starts going out with colleagues and friends. I'm starting to get seriously pissed because with three weeks till the wedding there is a tonne of stuff to do. Instead of her wanting to talk about things, find a solution, change the wedding so we have a more private ceremony she just completely turns the other way and doesn't want to deal with anything. She continues to say she needs time/space but with the wedding on the horizon, family flying in, plans to confirm I tell her no way. We deal with it now. We argue, things blow up, she gives me reasons like we're always watching our spending, money is tight all the time, the last year has been only about the flat. I understand her point of view but I look it completely the other way. The last year was tough but I and we were building a life together. The wedding was our light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Things would only get better from then on. At the end I feel like she is grasping at straws and just looking for excuses to cancel the wedding. Even our mutual close friends call her out on everything and tell her to get a grip. Eventually I reach a point where I'm just no longer comfortable with marrying her. I call it off but I feel like I had no choice and she forced me into it. The first person I call is my brother who completely understands. I'm then about to call my mom and my finance starts crying telling me not to do it. That once I do it the wedding is really off and that she knows I will break up with her. I'm so confused at this point I say ok we will wait one more day and then decide. Next day she messages me asking if I called my mom yet and that its for the best and that if we go through with the wedding we would both end up hating each other. She then says she will be home at around 9pm as she is going to a concert with colleagues. At this point, I don't know how to explain it something just breaks inside me. I tell her to pack her things, have fun at the concert and I will deal with canceling the wedding on my own. I turn off my work computer and leave the office. She immediately writes me in a panic saying she won't be going out anymore and that she will go for a walk on her own and come home later. We meet later in the evening and I blow up on her. She's abandoned me, the relationship, has no empathy to my situation. At this point I tell her the wedding is absolutely not happening. She says its best that she not be here once family come to visit as she is too embarrassed. She goes to her moms for a couple nights but they don't have a such a good relationship and eventually she finds a room to rent on short term basis. 

Family then arrives, I spend two weeks with them and I only see my girlfriend a few times during this period. She apologizes for everything, tells me she loves me but that she is glad we didn't go through with it. I tell her that everything changed after the conference and she finally admits that it is true. I suspect she may have met someone or gotten a crush but she says it's not true. Just that the new job changed her and made her realize she's just not ready for marriage. The new found independence really changed her mind basically. At this point the relationships status is just not clear between us. She wants to stay together but there are so many questions. What now? I have all this resentment built up. She abandoned me when I needed her the most.  I then ask her to move out all of her things from the flat. That I can't continue being in a relationship that is in such a grey zone. I tell her to move out her things, we can continue dating and that the wedding bands will be waiting for her. When she hears this she gets pretty shocked, then angry then incredibly sad. She says she knows she fucked up and that she hurt me. She agrees that we do need time apart.

On Thursday she is coming to get the rest of her things. I have no idea what to do next. Do I make one last attempt to save the relationship and tell her she can stay. Do I get more clarity on what we are going forward? Do I let her move out her things completely and give us both space to see what we want? Throughout all of this I thought that she may have been cheating but I know 100% that it is not the case. After discussing it within family members and several close mutual friends I say the number reason for her 180 was just the job, new found Independence and maybe realizing she is just not ready yet for the role of a wife and mother. That's fine I understand that but how do I move forward by not getting hurt again? Should I end it and see if she comes back? Or am I over-thinking it?

 **TL;DR**  We cancelled the wedding the three weeks before it was meant to happen. Four weeks before the wedding we're wearing our rings getting excited for the big day. She goes away on a work conference for her new job which is the catalyst for everything falling apart. Suddenly she does a 180 and is not ready for marriage. I guess the new job showed her a new independent life which made her question everything. "
"I (34M) want out of my marriage, but my wife (33F) has no idea


This is my first real post on Reddit, I didn't know where to turn to for help, so here goes nothing.

My wife and I have been together (on and off) for 18 years. Together for 4, married for 4, divorced for 4, then remarried and currently been remarried for going on 6. I want out. So bad. But I don't know how to do it, and she has no idea anything is wrong.

Before I go any further, I will state this: Please don't comment with the ""JUST TALK TO HER"" or ""COMMUNICATE"" or any other derivatives thereof. I have tried. Over our entire history together. And my feelings/emotions/opinions are never respected or listened to. I've just been made to feel like they're wrong. Also, any time I bring up anything that I'm unhappy about in my life or with her, it goes down the guilt-trip road of: ""I'm such a terrible wife/mother/person, just kill me now and get it over with"" or ""If I'm so awful why did you even marry me in the first place?"" So the communication is not there. Hence, talking to her about things is a non-option.

Like I said, been married twice, for a total of going on 10 years, with a 4 year divorce in the middle. Not just a separation, a full fledged divorce with child support and everything. Speaking of child support - we have two kids, both having ADHD, the oldest being autistic and having ODD as well, so he gets therapists and needs counseling and all that. (Thank God for Medicaid) 

She hasn't worked since 2011, has several physical and mental illnesses, such as fibromyalgia, severe depression, bi-polar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and others. Things that she claims keeps her from working, doing things around the house, and participating in life in general. 

Because of her (and my children's) issues, I'm left to do everything around the house. **Everything.** Working, cooking, cleaning, laundry, bills, doctor appointments, med managing, driving, or any and every other thing that a house and family need to make it on a day to day basis. I even keep her driver's license (she hasn't driven in 4 years) and debit card in my wallet because the only time she would ever need them is if I had taken her somewhere.

I'm so done. I'm over. I have no life. No me time. It's not as if I mind doing these things, because mostly I don't; I like taking care of people and making them happy and doing things for them. But I have absolutely no appreciation for what I do. From any of them. They don't see me as a father/husband/actual person, I'm just the caregiver making sure that everyone is fed and medicated and has clean clothes. There are four days during the year when I would hope to get some kind of gift or something: Anniversary, Father's Day, my birthday, and Christmas. It's been 3 years since I've even gotten so much as a card on any of those days from my wife or children. It's been 4-1/2 years since I've had any type of sexual contact with my wife. Not intercourse to completion, mind you, any sexual contact. At. All. Anytime I bring it up, I get called a ""dirty old man"".

If things couldn't get any worse: She has no idea I'm upset, because of what I explained above. She thinks everything is peachy; that this is how it's supposed to be. I've totally given up explaining my feelings, and just resigned to doing everything as not to cause fights or screaming matches. It's just easier that way. But I've come to a point where I can't do it anymore. I just can't endure this unhappiness much longer. I've come to the point where while coming home from the grocery store, if I just happened to swerve into oncoming traffic on the freeway, I wouldn't be mad about it. Not that I would ever do anything like that on purpose, or that I would ever subject my children to that, but just a complete indifference to being alive.

So my quandary is: I don't know where to start or what to do. Also worthy of note: I am dead-ass broke. I mean, we are paycheck-to-4-days-before-payday. So I don't have the luxury of just up and leaving and having somewhere to go. I don't have the option of calling a lawyer. We have no savings, up to our eyeballs in debt, and can barely afford to keep food on the table and the lights on.

Help. Please.

**tl;dr:** Guy wants to leave wife, wife does nothing to contribute to anything, also doesn't know about issues, guy can't afford to leave, nor does he know how to do it."
"I'm tired of my girlfriend [25F] giving me [25F] a hard time over an ex boyfriend I dated before coming out as a lesbian.


I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years now and I love her to pieces but I've been really sick of her attitude lately and being constantly made to feel bad about things that happened before we even met. 

We have pretty opposite personalities, she's very confident and loud, always the life of the party and assertive. I'm shy,introverted and prefer to give in and avoid conflict. She usually gets her own way in our relationship and that works fine for me most of the time. She's very into activism and wears her rainbow flag on her sleeve and she's very into feminism and LGBT rights. Many things I agree with but sometimes she has some harsh views. 

One view is that she's often quite anti men, we have male friends but she often complains about men and talks about negative things in the media. This causes conflict between us since in high school I dated a close friend for a couple of months who was male. Ever since I confessed that I dated a guy in high school and lost my virginity to him she makes snide remarks about me liking men and argues with me about it. The confession happened after he made contact again after a long time as he'd  been reaching out to old friends from our home town. He told me he's getting married soon and even talked about inviting me and my partner to his wedding. She wasn't happy though when she found out I briefly dated him. I'm honest with her about everything but she made me feel really bad about telling her. 

I explained that I wasn't sure who I was back then and I broke up with him because I wasn't happy with being with guys. It felt wrong and then I figured out I like girls. She doesn't see it though, to her it's like an insult and like I've been corrupted. I'm not even her first either so it's nothing to do with that. She had girlfriends before me. I just wish she'd chill out. 

We've been together 4 years after being introduced by mutual friends in college and living together for over 3 so I don't feel like I have anything to prove. After being introduced there was nobody else we wanted to be near, we hung around with other friends less to be together. She's aware of all this yet still gets so stressed if she sees me talking to guys or she makes comments on how I'm easily led by men. 

I've tried talking about this but she just gets angry and I end up dropping the issue because I don't want the stress of fighting with her. I just want her to move on and stop getting upset over something that happened 8 or 9 years ago before we even met. 

How do I explain to her that a short fling in my teenage years doesn't decide my sexual preference or who I want to be with now? 

TL;DR: My girlfriend has really strong LGBT and feminist views and after I reconnected with an old friend from back home I shared that we'd briefly dated in high school and had sex at that time. She saw red and since has been constantly bringing it up and making snide comments about me liking men. That old friend was interested in us attending his wedding back in our home town, I was excited to see him and show her where I grew up but now I'm just stressed. "
"I[21F] slept with my best friend's[21F] of 18 yrs, cousin's[30ishF] husband[32M]. Now I am freaking out and I dont know what to do, Advice?


**Names and other unimportant details have changed for privacy.**

Molly and I have been best friends since kindergarten, for the 4th of July 5 years ago, she invited me to go to Las Vegas with her, she was invited by her cousin, who said she could bring a friend. I was going through a breakup at the time, and it felt like the end of the world, so I was happy to go.

That is where I met her cousin Nancy, and Nancy's fiance Fernando. They were a really cute couple, and I couldn't help but notice how cute Fernando was, he was finishing Law School so the trip was a bit of a celebration, because he was offered a job at a really nice law firm in LA.

Some night during the trip after everyone else was asleep, I was outside of our room sobbing like a baby. Fernando came out and found me. He comforted me, and we walked and talked for nearly an hour. He told me how beautiful I was, and I was smart, and wise beyond my years. He made me feel much better. When he walked me to my room he hugged me, told me how it would be okay, and kissed me on the cheek. He lingered for a minute, it felt like he was gonna actually kiss me, but he didnt. I told myself that I was just jumping to conclusions, or having fantasies that were baseless.

***

Fast forward 5 years, haven't really seen him since then. Once molly and I graduated, we went to NYU. Sat night, I saw Fernando at a club. Fernando was just at the bar, having a drink. We noticed each other, and I got the feeling that he remembered me too. We got to talking, and he told me that he was in town for business, and would be leaving back to LA on Sun. He also told me that he and Nancy didnt work out, and he was currently single.

We drank, and we danced. He was all over me, but I loved it. I didnt realize that I still had a crush on him after all of these years. The fact that he wanted me felt really good. After a night of drinking and dancing, we Uber'ed back to his hotel room. The sex was amazing, he was amazing. In the morning, he took me for breakfast, and sent me home feeling really good. We promised to text and see where things took us.

When I got to my place, I finally got a chance to charge my phone. I started to tell molly about my night. I told her that I saw Fernando, and before I could finish, she told me that Fernando and Nancy had 3 kids now. ""3 kids in 5 years, crazy right."" It felt like my heart had been ripped out. I couldn't tell her what happened now. So I lied. I said that I saw Fernando on my way to the club, and I ended up meeting a guy, but it was just a 1 night thing.

I am so torn. If I tell her it could ruin my friendship. If I dont, I am a terrible person. I feel like a terrible person either way. Help.

TL;DR Saw my. BFFs Cousins husband at a club, he said he was single. We slept together. He isnt single. I dont know what to do. Advice?"
"[UPDATE] How do I [25F] ask him [25M] what we are without making a fool of myself?


Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zdfu6/how_do_i_25f_ask_him_25m_what_are_we_without/?st=JJWY920Q&amp;sh=62e75887

Well I talked to him. I didn’t feel like fool but I did feel heartbreak.

He said he’s too busy for a relationship right now but would like to keep seeing me. We have been exclusive but honestly it’s just not good enough for me after 3 months. Only because I hate it when people act like they’re in a relationship and do everything besides put a label on it or claim you as their significant other. And then when things go awry they throw that excuse right in your face “but we weren’t in a relationship!” 

So. I’m not sure what to do. We have mutual friends but I am not that close to them anyways. I plan on just keeping my distance and keeping myself busy until I no longer think of him. Out of sight, out of mind. 

Any other advice in getting over you weren’t in a relationship with could help me right now. So feel free to share. 

TL;DR: I talked to the guy I was casually dating about what we are and he said he’s too busy to be in a relationship. As in, he doesn’t want to be in a relationship. I decided I don’t want that and I want to move on. "
"My friend (26m) is being a home wrecker with a girl (25f) in our friend group who recently got married.


My group of friends is pretty close knit, we all do things as a group and try to include everyone when we do things if possible. About 2 years ago, my friend (we will call him A) started hanging out with this girl (we will call her B) in the hopes that he could hook up with her. They went on a date. At least what he thought was a date. Turns out she had a boyfriend who lived overseas and just wanted more friends. So she starts hanging out within the group more and becomes a part of it. 


Fast forward to about 3 months ago, B is engaged and planning a wedding and getting things ready for when she will move overseas with her husband once they’re married. None of us were invited to the wedding because she said it was a small intimate wedding. We were kinda thrown off since we had been some of her closest friends for awhile but whatever. Her wedding she can do what she wants.  

They got married about a month ago, and B started getting things rolling to move (visas, passport, etc). 

A invited my partner and I to his place for a 4th of July party. While we were all in the pool everyone noticed that B wasn’t wearing her wedding ring and was all over A. Throwing her legs over his and sitting on his lap in the pool. At one point they snuck off to the garage together while A had his arm around her and they were being real “hush-hush”. Overall not how a EXTREMELY RECENTLY married should act around “just a friend”

There’s been other signs too. My partner and I met A and B at a bar two weekends ago and it was more of the same behavior. Her legs draped over his under the table, no wedding ring, he would pinch her leg and wink at her when he thought we weren’t looking. 

Up until last night I was worried that I was making something out of nothing, that I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope I was just seeing what I wanted to see. 


A lives with 3 of our other friends. B doesn’t live at their house. We made plans to show up at A and our friends house to play DnD. My partner and I get there and as soon as we walk in the door A is fumbling with his hair/putting a hat on and B is bouncing off the couch from being next to A while pulling her dress down and she immediately gets as far away from A as she possibly can and comes and hugs my partner. They were doing something, wether it be making out, or fucking. 

There’s other things too. They both tag each other in memes all day on social media. My friends who live with A say B sleeps in his bed at night and wears his clothes while he’s at work. 

Our group has considered messaging her husband on Facebook to warm him, but we’re worried it’s not our place to say. We just don’t know what to do. 


TL:DR recently married girl in our friend group is fucking one of our other friends less than a month after her wedding while she is awaiting her move overseas to be with her husband.

"Caught my girlfriend (25f) cheating on me with an older man. I am planning on ghosting her.


I have been with my girlfriend for the last 1.5 years and a few  weeks ago I opened her old laptop to find a throwaway email account which she has been using to communicate with this older guy. Explicit photos were shared and there was a brief video of them having sex. From what I can tell this  seems to have started 2 months ago.

I was devastated and heart broken. I still can't believe how she could look me in the eye every day and tell me she loves me while fucking this other guy. 
Luckily for me the next day I had to go out of town for a week long work commitment. I left without confronting her so she still doesn't know I know. 

I spent the majority of the first day or if town crying and essentially mourning my relationship. I called my close friend and talked all night. Strangely after that I was completely okay and overnight I lost all the love I had for her. Even now when she calls me to check up, I am constantly annoyed and try to find ways to end the conversation. She know something is up but I just blamed it on my work. Also I am pretty sure she is using my absence to have a good time with her cheating partner. 

Anyway I was thinking yesterday and I feel like just ghosting her. She moved in with me last month and my lease will be up next month. I could just pay the landlord the rent for the next month (I have a well paying job and it won't incur any major loss) and move without telling her. My company has a branch in New York City and I could request to move there which is totally doable. Except her and the job there was nothing for me in the current City I live in anyway. We don't have any major shared finances and the rest of the details like furniture etc are minor things that I could ask a local friend to sell it for me for a cut of the profit.

The more I think about this I am convinced I could easily do it. I don't know how she'll feel, I mean if she was cheating on me I don't think she cared much about me in the first place. 
What do you guys think? Is it too harsh?

PS: relatively new to Reddit so excuse any errors made. Also minor unimportant details have been changed.

Tldr: caught my girlfrind(25f) cheating. Planning on ghosting her. Thoughts?"
"Am I [29F] Ungrateful or is He [31M] a Selfish Gifter?


We've been together for almost 10 years. We have other issues that we're working on, but I feel like this is a big one that keeps coming up. And every time I try to address it, I come off as ungrateful... and the cycle repeats.

BACKGROUND

I grew up really poor. Like, I remember going with my mom from one cash-advance place to the next to pay off the next cash-advance place, to the next to get money to pay back the first one... and ending up with just enough to cash to either pay the electric OR the water. I remember making one can of chili stretch for four people and seeing my mom pass on dinner altogether so we could eat.

I'm grateful to be in a better place now, but I feel like that experience has shaped how I feel about big purchases. 

I spend a lot of time researching and planning and saving and justifying the purchase to myself, so I can eventually buy the exact thing that I want. 

THE ISSUE

First example: I had been wanting a DSLR for years. I have always loved photography but didn't have the money for good equipment to really learn the technical stuff. So I researched for over a year and found the exact perfect one for me and my experience level. Of course, I talked about it with my husband as I was researching, and I was 100% clear about which one I was planning to buy when I had the money.

Well, he comes into some money, then did his OWN research, and then decided which camera would be ""better,"" and he bought me that one instead. He hyped it up saying he got me something he was so excited to show me, gave it to me for Mother's Day a couple of years ago. He knew it wasn't the one I wanted. It was a ""more advanced"" camera, from a different brand, and it was missing the main feature I wanted in the other camera.

I was happy to have a camera but deeply disappointed that it wasn't the one I had planned for. And, like always, he bought it off Amazon or eBay or somewhere that I couldn't actually return or exchange it. He expected me to be through the roof excited, because of how long I had wanted a DSLR... and I thanked him, but I did ask why he got that one instead of the other one... and he went on and on about how this one is so much better and accused me of being ungrateful and an asshole.

I know his love language is gift-giving... but I feel like he gifts in a really selfish way. He's looking for praise and happy-tears and a whole performance... and he enjoys doing the research and picking out the ""right"" thing, and in the process he completely ignores what I would actually want or need.

He does this All. The. Time. Usually with smaller things. But it happened again with something that was really important to me. I've been planning for a year to buy a really nice road bike. I spent months researching online and finally bought a bike for $500 a couple of weeks ago. 

Tonight, he came in and said, ""I put something on your bike.""

And immediately my heart sank. I wish he would just give me a gift, let me open it, and put it on my own bike. But instead, he found a bicycle light at the store, picked out the one he liked, bought it, and installed it on my bike without asking me. As a ""surprise."" 

I know this is stupid. 

From his perspective, I'm complaining because my husband bought me a light for my new bicycle and installed it for me.

But I'm just really disappointed, and I feel guilty. He said I looked mad, and I said I would have rather gotten the light as a gift and installed it myself. And he called me ungrateful and an asshole. 

I feel like he doesn't know me at all. I would rather he not give me any gifts at all, than to give me gifts that make me feel disregarded, unimportant, and ignored. 

**tl;dr My husband keeps giving me gifts he thinks are really thoughtful, but make me feel ignored and unimportant. He thinks I'm ungrateful, and I feel guilty for being disappointed. How do I resolve this issue? Do I need to just get over it and say thank you?** "
"My (23f) sister (25f) embarrassed me at my birthday family dinner, and she doesn't understand why I'm upset. Am I wrong?


Growing up, me and my sister were always best friends. Never fought, never had issues. Nothing. After she met her boyfriend, things started changing.

It was my 23rd birthday yesterday, and we had a big family dinner because it's the first birthday we've all been together in awhile, it was a big deal..and supposed to be fun.

At some point, everyone got talking about having kids and starting families. I have 6 siblings, and both of my older sisters are about to get married to their partners, and are more established in their lives than I am mine. I can admit that.

I was in a relationship with a guy, who ended up being married and lying about it, but also cheating on me on dating sites. I was absolutely destroyed over this because we had talked about marriage, and then I find out it's all a lie basically.

We broke up a month ago, and I've been pretty down ever since. I gave that guy everything, I love him and wanted him only, and I've had to realize that on his end, it may of all been fake.

I tried to forget about it for my birthday, it's been a month but I'm not over it at all, I miss him everyday and am still crying over it. But yesterday I tried my best.

My sister ended up making a joke about how ""OcarinaOfTime088 is never gonna start a family of her own, she's just gonna end up a stepmom with a guy who isn't even divorced."" but she was laughing.

Nobody else laughed, and it just got awkward in the room. I just said ""don't. That's not funny."" and she said ""oh come on. The relationship was a joke and so is this. Just laugh about it.""

Then she proceeded to tell me she's trying to help me because ""I'm not young enough anymore to test guys out"" and that I need to find a guy immediately, because I'm ""not young anymore and running out of time"".

She told me I need to step back and examine my life and at 23, I should at least have an idea of who I'm going to marry and have kids with, and she said at this rate that won't happen until I'm 30 because ""I'm still stuck on my married exboyfriend"". 

I felt so awkward. Everyone knew about my relationship problems but I avoid talking about it. It's embarrassing to me and she knows this. And now she was even making me feel like I'm old?

I tried talking to her and I ended up crying about it and was even more embarrassed. She said she doesn't know why I'm being a drama queen, and that I should be thankful for her trying to guide me.

I haven't talked to her since then, but she's been trying to text me like normal and I don't know what to do :(

Tl;dr; was in a longterm relationship with a guy before finding out he was married. We broke up, and I've still been struggling bc I love him. My sister embarrassed me at my birthday dinner by mentioning him and saying I'm old. Now she says I'm being a drama queen."
"I (28M) don't think my fiance (27F) can keep taking care of her best friend (27F) anymore


So first of all, throwaway because I'm pretty sure best friend uses reddit.

Background:
I began dating my fiance, who we'll call M, 7 years ago, when she was 20 and I was 21. At the time M was roommates with her best friend, R, and R's boyfriend of 10 years (they'd literally been ""dating"" since they were 10) B. 

I immediately became close with B. We shared lots of hobbies, video game favorites, etc... M, B, R and myself all became close friends. 
5 years ago, B was diagnosed with late stage cancer. Things hit him hard and quick and by the end of the year he was gone. This crushed both M and myself, but obviously no one more then R. 

From that point on, R began to spiral. She managed to cling on to her GPA and maintain her masters program for a bit, but didn't stick it out for long because of her massive depression and eventual alcoholism. R began therapy and all of our friend group was there for her. M and myself went numerous times to her house (which was bought for her by her parents thank god) because she called us at all hours of the night. 

Over the years, R has not gotten better. She has lost jobs and friends. Luckily she has an inheritance from her grandmother that will last her a long time. But even her parents have stopped talking to her and now her only friend is M, and by extension, me. 

My fiance dedicates so much time to making sure R is okay. R has become a hardcore, nonfunctional alcoholic. She does nothing for herself. M stocks her fridge every week to make sure she has food (but somehow R has time to get alcohol). Her phone is on at all hours of the night because R calls her from strange and dangerous places needing to be picked up. A few times we have sat vigil in the ICU. 

Please don't get me wrong. I love M and I love her dedication to her friend. But we have not been on a vacation since B died because R might need her. M has missed so many days of work because of R. R ruined our engagement party by getting too drunk and crying about her own lost love... and M drove her home instead of staying with me. 

It's gotten to the point where I think I need to put my foot down. I'm not trying to make M cut off R, just set healthy boundaries of any friendship. Anytime I bring this up M gets defensive. I understand why. But I can't deal with it anymore and I don't think M can either.

Basically I'm asking for advice about talking to M in a constructive manner. I'm trying to come from a place of compassion for R and not resentment. I just want what's best and healthiest from my fiance. Any advice is welcome 

Tldr- fiance has spent too much time being held back by alcoholic best friend. Need help showing her this."
"Fiance [24F] and I [24M] are about to have the big and extravagant that she dreamed of as a little girl. Problem is: she is not happy because her mom and dad separated around the same time I proposed. Her dad blames her and has not talked to her in 3 months. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO


Hello everyone,

I am genuinely asking for help because for the first time in a long time, I feel helpless and it hurts me knowing that I am not able to help my significant other. Please, I beg of you... Please help me.

My fiance and I started dating when we were 16. We went to the same high school, graduated college with the same degree and moved in together the second we finished college with high paying jobs. A couple of months after finishing college, I took her to her dream city and proposed to her at her dream location. Everyone says that we have a perfect relationship and I would, for the most part, agree. But, my fiance is depressed.


My fiance had a rough childhood: Her mom was a teen Mom and ran away with her dad at the age of 16. As she grew up, she witnessed nothing but fights, crying and domestic violence. She was emotionally and mentally scared by what she witnessed in her childhood. Her dad was very controlling and held her mom hostage at the house. He believed that a woman's place was at home cooking, cleaning and taking care of the kids. He believed woman shouldn't drive, work or socialize. My fiance witness this ideology unfold throughout the years as her mom went into deep depression. 

My fiance was finally able to escape that hell when we both went to college. I thought that would be the end of this situation but she felt nothing but regret. She might have escaped but her mom and her siblings still lived that hell. She was always worried about the well being of her mom and siblings. She felt guilty knowing that she had abandoned her mom and siblings. She would cry occasionally throughout the years but gradually she got better and did everything she could to help and support her siblings. 

We finished college and were wondering what we would do now. She did not want to go back to her house and I didn't want to live without her. We decided to move in as a couple. Originally, I asked her mother and father permission to take her daughter. We believed it was the right time because we both had well paying jobs and we were able to support ourselves without any help. He did not give his blessing and though that my fiance should stay at the house. I stood up to her dad and let him know that my fiance had previously discussed moving in together and no one was going to stop us. When I looked at her to back me up in front of her dad: she frozed and looked away. She did not speak. She did not defend me. She allowed me to leave that house without her. I was extremely frustrated and cried. I felt helpless and while I hate the fact that she did not stand up for our relationship, I do understand the power hold he has over her. One week later I went back and took her with me regardless of his blessing and she was so happy I did

Now that we have moved together, I knew that I was going to propose soon. She always talked about her dream wedding. She wanted all her friends and family to be there. She wanted to be proposed in a romantic way. She wanted to do all the traditions: father walking her down the aisle, father &amp; daughter dance, etc. While she never had a good relationship with her dad, she always wanted to. She always wanted her dad... To be a dad. To take care of the family, to show love and tell her that he loved her. She wanted him to be happy for her. She just wanted a dad. 


Her mom and dad continue to fight weekly. One day, her mom finally snapped and decided that she was never happy and decided to divorce him once and for all. She had always talked about leaving him but this time, she was serious. She kicked him out of the house and did not allow him to enter again. He thought that he would just walk in the next day but the mom had changed the locks and said enough was enough. My fiance found out about the situation around the same time I proposed to her. On one hand, I just asked her to marry me but on the other hand, her parents just separated from their marriage. On one hand, she was happy because her mom finally escaped that he'll, but on the other hand, she was sad that her parents were never truly in love. Everything happen so quick and my proposal was at the most inconvenient time.

Her dad expected her and her siblings to vouch for him. He wanted to use my fiance and her siblings as leverage to get his marriage back. When the time came for all of them to sit down and discuss the situation. My fiance was very upfront and let everyone know that she is glad that they had separated. She was glad to see her mom smile again. She was glad that her siblings didn't have to hear shouting every day. Her dad took offense to what she said and disowned my fiance. 

The wedding is in aonth and my fiance has not spoken to her dad in 3 months. While I firmly believe that it is for the best to never speak to him again, she still aches to have a dad for once in her life. She wants a dad to support her and be with her on her wedding day. She cries that he doesn't ask about the wedding. She cries that he has not offered help. She cries that he says that he will not attend the wedding. She cries because she cannot stand the fact that her dad will most likely not attend her wedding. She cries every night thinking about that possibility. She thought that once her parents separated, everything would be better: her parents would no longer fight and she would be able to build a relationship with both of them separately. What ended up happening is that her dad decided not to talk to her again.

She is depressed. She has told me that something she doesn't want to be alive. She makes me aware that all she has done all her life is take care of people but it seems that no one takes care of her. This hurts me because I truly believe that I have supported her throughout all of this but it's hard sometimes because she lashes at me and directs all her problems towards me. She has made me aware that sometimes she wants to hurt herself and that she has had suicidal thoughts. She doesn't know what to do and I don't know what to do.

Every day that the wedding approaches, she cries more. She wants to have the ideal ""dad"" and she wants a dad that would support her on her wedding day. I gave her this suggestion: ask her dad to attend the wedding. Put the ball on his court and allow him to decided how important his daughter is to him. She can't bear the idea of asking because she is afraid that he will say no which will put her in a deeper depression. I feel like asking him is the only thing she can do and that she has to prepare for the possibility of him saying no. 

What do I need to do to support her in her internal struggle? I feel like she is not happy right now and I don't want her to feel like this on our wedding day. What should I do? What should she do?


TLDR: fiance and have been dating for 7 years. Graduated college and decided to propose. Her mom and dad decided to separate around the same time. She was devastated. Her dad blames her for the divorce and now he might not go to the wedding. She is depressed and has admitted to suicidal thoughts because he might not attend. What do I do to support her? What does she need to do to feel better?

"3 months ago, my (24f) ex (25m) of 3 years dumped me because he wanted more ""variety."" He called me today to say he needed my ""friendship and stability"" because a girl he was dating is pregnant. What do I do with this? I'm in shock but still care and tempted to help him, whatever that entails.



hello, jaw is still on the floor at the phone call I just took. If this is scattered it's because my brain feels like jello. Three months ago, ex dumped me out of the blue because he felt like he needed more ""variety"" out of his dating life before he settled down. His breakup was in the middle of a restaurant and I was so blindsided, I actually thought he'd asked me out to eat to propose. 

I knew he was dating again because I actually saw him out to dinner with a girl that looked remarkably similar to me and it really hurt. I'm not over him by a long shot. 

So today I saw that he was calling on my phone. I didn't answer and there was no VM or text so as much as I was hyperventilating at seeing his picture pop up on my phone, I figured it was a butt dial or something. He called back five minutes later can and I gathered my gumption to answer. 

He asked if we could meet to talk. I said I was not ready to talk with him. He said ""it's not about getting back together with you"" (gee thanks) ""I'm in a bad spot and I really need someone I can trust, I feel I can always trust you."" I thought about it for half a second and said ok, to meet me at Starbucks in an hour. He said fine. 


We got there and he gave me a hug, I about broke down into tears because I miss him so much but I managed to keep my composure. He danced around the subject for a minute until finally I got tired of it and told him to spit it out. 


He said he got a girl pregnant. I was like what the fuck why is he telling me this. He said like he said on the phone he's stuck and doesn't know what to do and needs someone he can trust. I told him that it actually seemed like he was rubbing it in my face in a weird way that he's dating again and I'm not. He said that's not true and he assumed I would have started dating right away. I asked him if it was the girl I saw him out to dinner with. He said no it was another girl he'd been seeing since shortly after we broke up. I made the huge mistake of asking how many girls he'd been seeing and he just said ""I've been very busy on Tinder."" 


I asked him what he expected me to do, he said he didn't know, he just needed a friend. I asked what the girl planned on doing. He said she was strictly religious and was keeping the baby. I asked him again what exactly he wanted me to do because I was still lost. He said his parents and friends were all lecturing him what an idiot he was and he needed someone to not judge him. I asked him if he seriously thought that person was me because i'm judging the fuck out of him and he would have never, ever, ever had to worry about me getting pregnant. He said he was so sorry for everything that happened and he missed me. I told him I missed him too but that ship sailed. He reiterated that he just needed a friend. I told him I needed to go but I would think about what was going on. 


We left and he again hugged me and said he was sorry. That was this afternoon around 2. It's now after 7 and he just texted me ""thank you for seeing me this afternoon. I'm so lost and I really need a friend. It was just a relief to see you.""


I am so lost. I still care deeply for him and don't want to see him in pain. I want to be there for him but don't really know what that would mean. 


Is he just being a complete asshole for turning to me in such a situation? Should I basically slam dunk the situation back in his face?


Is there anything I can do to help him? 


I would love any advice. Any advice whatsoever. Thank you. this is the most confusion situation I've ever been in in my life. 


TL;DR: my ex boyfriend contacted me saying that he needed someone he could trust and be a friend to him after he got a girl he was dating pregnant. I have no idea what that entails, what he actually needs and what I can do for him. I still care deeply for him and feel like I should be there for him even though I'm lost. I would love any help. I know this is confusing and I can try to clear anything up if there are questions.

"Me [37 M] with my ex-girlfriend[35 F] have an unexpected baby on the way


I was with my ex for only a few weeks and whilst were were using condoms for protection it broke.

She took the morning after pill and went on the pill right away, and we did a negative pregnancy test a few weeks later and she said she then had a period. 

4 months later she has told me she is having a baby, and contacted me out if the blue and her next scan is the 20week scan happening next week.

She doesnt want any involvement from me, financial or otherwise but i am willing to meet my obligations in ajy case. 

My current gf (36) is the love of my life, but she is adamant that she will not be with anyone with a child by another. The very first qiestion she asked me when we started dating was if i had any children, so i know this means so much to her.

I feel helpless, my ex holds all the cards and is only willing to do a paternity test after the birth. 

My current gf is upset and i cannot give her any answers, but i had to tell her as I felt i was potentially trapping her if i lied about this and didnt say anything until the paternity is confirmed.

I dont know where to go from here, i love my gf and want to stay with her but i can only accept tge decision she makes. Should i fight for her or not?

Any advice welcome, or any similar situations always appreciated.

Tl;dr ex is pregnant, i have no proof until baby comes in december but i have had to tell my current gf so that she can make her own mind up. 

Thanks. "
"My [20/F] boyfriend [24/M] is extremely stressed studying for the MCAT and has been really distant. The only thing he seems to want from me right now is sex—I feel used.


My boyfriend, who I met at college,  and I have been together for a little under two years. For the past three months, he's been cramming HARD for the MCAT which he will be taking in August. I know how important this is to him so initially I tried really hard to be there for him (e.g. helping him study, making him food, etc.). He didn't really want the attention and much preferred studying by himself in his dorm or the library. 

This went on for about a month and a half or so before he transitioned into ""full-studying mode"". He studies all day and never leaves the library or his dorm unless its to eat. He carries his books everywhere. During this time, I've tentatively tried to help him but he always turns really snappish and annoyed. For instance, I'll ask if I can come over to help him and he says sure. So I'll head over to his dorm and he'll ignore me for three hours. If I ask if he would like anything or if I can do anything to help he'll say ""No, you can leave if you want"". It's really starting to annoy me. As for another example, I'll suggest that he take a break from studying and head out to the beach to relax and to destress. He'll look at me incredulously and ask how I could ask him that when he's taking the MCAT in less than a month. He'll ask ask if I even want him to get into a top medical school like I'm jeopardizing his chances by asking him to relax for one day. However, it's not always like this. Sometimes I'll drop by his dorm and we'll order takeout and just sit and talk like we normally do. I would say this usually happens once every week or so.

But sex is a completely different issue. Our sex life before the MCAT took over his life was really good and there was an even amount of initiating between the two of us. Recently, it's all been him. I'll be over at his dorm ""helping him study"" (AKA being ignored) and after a while he'll whip around in his chair, stare at me and crawl over and start kissing me. It almost always leads to sex. After we finish, he'll lay with me for a bit then go back to studying (ignoring) me. This happens around 4-5 times a week. It seems like the only thing he wants from me is sex and it hurts a lot. I understand that he's extremely stressed, probably the most stressed he's been in a long time but I don't think it warrants this type of ignoring. I feel quite used. I also feel like over the last month, he's been using me to relieve his frustration. 

Am I being too sensitive? Have any of you guys had an SO that went through the MCAT/LSAT or something similar and how did you all deal? In terms of my situation, how should I go about communicating this to my boyfriend/solving it?

TL;DR: Boyfriend has turned extremely distant since the beginning of summer due to studying for the LSAT. He ignores my offers to help and even when I'm physically in the same room as him, ignore me. The only thing he seems to want from me right now is sex. I feel used. "
"Brother (35M) has extreme favoritism with his kids, I (25F) feel like he is really affecting them, their personalities, etc. Is there anything I can do?


My brother has a son ""John"" who is 13 and 2 daughters - ""Lisa"" who is 8 and ""Kara"" who is 10. I love them all equally, and I'm sure my brother does too in his own way but he treats them in a way that I fear is affecting them negatively.

He is very hard on John, very critical, not affectionate, not very nice in general. He used to spank and hit him when he was younger but has stopped now. He doesn't tolerate any kind of show of weakness or sadness. However, he is the MOST involved in John's life by taking him to baseball and hockey practice, taking him out hunting or fishing or hiking, helps with homework, talks to him, etc. 

With Lisa and Kara, he essentially treats them like little princesses who are made of glass. He hugs them, kisses them, drops presents on them randomly, rarely ever disciplines them, never laid a hand on them no matter what. However, he is also not very involved with them and doesn't care about any of their outside activities or school.

I noticed this when it was just John and Kara, but it's become much worse with Lisa. I have heard her say multiple times things like ""I don't need to learn anything at school because I can just get married later"" or ""I don't need to go to art class because I just need to be pretty and that's it."" He has also perhaps unintentionally brainwashed Lisa into thinking she is the ""pretty one"" and she REALLY doesn't need to do anything but maintain her looks. Lisa says stuff like ""I'm the REAL pretty one."" I don't think she truly understands what she's saying but it's basically her default answer.

My brother has drilled these things into both their heads. I asked him if he tells them things like that and he admits yes, because it's the truth and it's reality. 

I just worry about them. There is no outright abuse going on but it just feels wrong how backwards my brother is teaching them. I haven't seen any effects in John yet, except that he's a little soldier already at age 13 and pretty unemotional and tough, never cries or complains, and he is very, very smart and determined. That is great! But the girls do nothing at school, don't have good grades, don't care, and don't really have any major outside activities. I know they are smart but they just don't care and no one else does either.

Is there ANYTHING I can do as an aunt to affect them positively? I only see them every other weekend or so, and usually I am just the fun aunt so I know they like me. Can I influence them in any way, even during these short visits? Or is this just a lost cause? It really depresses me to see this dynamic going on, but my brother refuses to change his mind. I should mention that he has full custody of the kids and his ex is pretty much out of the picture. It is ironic because he married her essentially because she was a very, very pretty but totally lazy and boring freeloader who didn't care about her future, her children, pretty much nothing but herself. But everything's great because she's pretty right?? That's why he divorced her.

TLDr: Brother holds his son up to impossible standards, pushes him, makes him get good grades, good scores, all kinds of activities - and treats his girls like fragile beauty queen princesses who don't need school or hobbies, as long as they stay pretty. The girls are picking up on this now and I hate that they are turning out to be this way. Is there anyway I can influence them at this point? "
"my (21f) boyfriend (21m) is mad at me because i didn't have sex with him.


Last night we had a huge fight (which he started) at 11pm until 1am. We both worked all day yesterday and both had an early start today. After a couple hours of crying and sorting out our issues he could see i was stressed we both needed to get some rest. i
I was still slightly sobbing and he started being all affectionate and then started touching me. I said ""sorry babe not tonight, i am emotionally exhausted and its 2am, sex is the last thing on my mind right now"".
Straight away he cracked the shits turned over and admitted he was both mad at me and does not think I love him (we have been together a couple years).
Today after work i texted him letting me know I am pretty hurt and shocked of his expectations of me last night.
He is still mad and thinks i dont love him because i didnt sleep with him, and refuses to see my side. He said my reason wasn't good enough.
Am i in the wrong here or is he being completely unreasonable and overreacting. We usually sleep together twice a day. 

TLDR: boyfriend is extremely mad at me for not having sex with him one night when i was upset. we usually sleep together twice a day so its not like i am neglecting him of sex.. "
"I [24M] caught girlfriend [23F] of 4 years cheating. She wants to flip this on me and make me the bad guy. Is there any point in trying to make her understand what she did was wrong?


Last night we went out with friends and got drunk. She was furiously texting someone and I asked her who it was. She said it was a female friend of hers. I saw her constantly shifting her phone away from my view and typing like crazy. Once drunk she showed me a message from her friend and I realized there were no massive messages like the ones she typed. They were small two or three word messages. 

When I got home I took a look at her phone. I know it's wrong but I didn't care cause we have so many issues, in a way I hoped the invasion of privacy would cause us to break up. I saw that she was texting another guy and that she had sex with him a month prior. 2 weeks ago, she had some messages with ANOTHER guy, with him telling her to come to his room. They were at the family home and she was visiting with her friends family. She says no, then he tells her no one would no. The next day he texted her ""thanks for last night it was amazing."" And she said ""thanks for spending time with me."" This is all at 3 in the morning when everyone is asleep. 

She is still saying that I'm lying and she never did that. I told her to look at her messages and she said no that's dumb because I don't have any messages from him. No amount of prodding would change her mind. She refused to acknowledge she's ever texted him. 

So I told her ""go fuck yourself and don't fucking contact me ever again."" She just got more upset and told me to go fuck myself and that I was a paranoid asshole. She got in her car and left. She lives an hour away right now so I don't think she'll come back. I want her to understand that I know she's lying. I know what I did was wrong and she tried to turn it on me. I do think infidelity with two guys is worse. Should I go no contact forever or try to make her understand then go no contact? 

Tl:dr - Snooped on girlfriend's phone and caught girlfriend cheating with two others guys. She refuses to acknowledge their existence or messages and is basically gas lighting me. What do I do?"
"My [17F] cousin [17M] secretly filmed me in the bathroom


I feel absolutely disgusting right now because of this. My family meets with my aunt's family for every holiday, and other days to just hang out. We've always seen each other often, starting when we were first born. For my grandfather's birthday, we all met up at my grandparents birthday to celebrate it. 


My cousins and I have always been close and have fun together joking and hanging around. We were playing cards today and my cousin went to the bathroom, and came back. 
About ten minutes later, I said I had to use the bathroom, but he insisted on using it first. So I was like 'whatever' and continued talking to my 12 year old cousin. 

Once he came back, I went in. I took off my pants and sat down when I noticed a phone aimed at me from across the bathroom. I got up and saw that it was propped against a towel and aimed directly at the toilet. Mind you, this was just a shelf for extra towels so it wouldn't have been used by us. Also the position it was in wasn't a lazy one, it was obvious it was focused at one place. 


My cousin's phone shuts off randomly a lot, and when I picked it up it was in the process of doing that, with the little samsung symbol appearing. I ended up grabbing it and taking it with me, and right when I got out,  my cousin rushed into the bathroom saying he needed to ""wash his hands."" Once in there, he asked where his phone was. I said I had it. He kept trying to get it back and eventually succeeded. He also asked if it was filming, and i said i didnt know. When I mentioned it was weird that it was in there, He said he was ""filming a magic trick"" for his girlfriend earlier and left it in there. I didn't get the phone back because the situation was so awkward and I didn't know if the video was saved. Plus I preferred for his parents to deal with it once I left. 


I texted my mom about it but she made up a story when telling them, saying we were goofing around and I was concerned about what was on his phone. She wanted to not seem accusatory of their son because theyre probably sensitive to it. Because of that I don't think my cousins parents realize the intensity or the disgusting factor of what happened. My uncle came to us and asked for the phone, but my cousin said it was dead since it bad shut off again and he left. 


This situation makes me feel really uncomfortable to ever see them again and I feel like it changes everything. I truly cannot believe it happened and I'm not sure what to even think. Reddit, please give me advice and share experiences if you have any. I know any future events with them will be weird no matter what, and it's hard to believe it was all a misunderstanding, though that's what my parents are telling me to make me feel better. Thank you for reading 


**TL;DR** My cousin possibly recorded me while using the bathroom and I don't know if it recorded because the phone shut off. I feel it will make times with them really awkward

"A guy [28M] I dated briefly committed suicide on the 1 year anniversary of our first date, in the park where we met. Should I contact his family? Attend the funeral?


We met a year ago yesterday, in a local park.  We had our first date that evening, and spent the next 3-4 months in a sort of whirlwind romance.  He was great at first, but it became obvious that he had significant mental health issues that he was ignoring.  I don't know if the details are really important, but he basically put me on a pedestal while at the same time completely ignoring the fact that I was an individual with thoughts/opinions/ideas/goals.  Within a month, his happiness was completely dependent on me, even though he really didn't know me.

When I broke up with him, his mental health issues became far worse.  He started showing up at my home demanding to see me.  He left letters at my workplace, in my mailbox, and on my car.  When he sat parked outside of my home for 8 hours straight, I finally called the police.  I filed a formal report, and they came to tell him to leave.  I moved out of that house a week later, and into a secure apartment building.  As far as I know, he never learned where I live now.

Last night he hung himself in the park where we met.  I'm completely at a loss for what to do next.  He lived at home, so I saw his parents and his older sisters fairly often while we were together.  I feel like I need to do *something*, but I don't want to add to their pain.  I also don't want them to think I don't care, because I do.  I don't know if I should send flowers, or a letter, or just leave them alone entirely.

**tl;dr:** Ex-boyfriend committed suicide on what would have been our first anniversary.  What do I do?"
"Me (28M) having regrets about Wife (28F). Need advice on if this is normal


 **TL;DR I don't know if I love my Wife anymore and am not sure if this type of regret is normal**  

First off I feel like a horrible person but I'm not quite sure If i love or even like my wife anymore. I have been dating her since I was 16 and feel like we have been together because I was to afraid to call it off with her, I kinda married her to make it easier on her because I was in the military for 6 years and wanted her to have insurance.

We have nothing in common, she likes to watch movies and I just want to play video games and workout. Recently I have tried to spend time with her but it just makes me so unhappy, ive tried expensive vacations going to the movies, etc and nothing works. I have also tried just talking to her. We sleep in separate bedrooms (always have) and i even tried sleeping together and it was awful.

I kinda thought this was the norm but recently i got to visit my buddy and I saw how he and his wife acted and was blown away. He actually shares interested with her and they play video games together that they both are actually enjoying and not just doing it as a forced activity. This made me terribly unhappy as that is literally kinda what I thought didn't exist (I am very happy for them thou). I feel like I always wanted a partner I can play games with and actually share interests.

I don't know how to approach this situation and just don't want to leave me wife. I am fairly wealthy (200kish yr) due to my career field and don't want to leave my wife in a bad situation but at the same time i feel just awful now. She works now but really doesnt have to support herself. Additionally this is not the main factor but she has getting very heavy recently, I would never consider this as a reason to leave her it just makes me think she doesn't care as I keep myself in fantastic shape.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this experience because I feel like a bad person for even having these thoughts. I just don't want to be 60 and wonder what if.  I know some regret is normal but is this normal. 

Thank you"
"My (33F) husband (37M) accused me of cheating


Throwaway acc and intentionally vague title because he is a redditor, and I don't want him to see this. 

We have been together 5 years. 
Recently going through a rough patch for reasons concerning his family so we have been living apart for about a month. 


About a month ago he accused me of cheating out of nowhere. Specifically he said he's just 'waiting for me to fuck someone from work.' 

Just to mention I'm leaving this job (handed my notice in today) and a big part of the reason is that I don't really like or get along with any of my colleagues. I tell him this many times so I don't know where he got that idea from. 


Last night we argued over something silly, as we were watching a reality TV show (Love Island for anyone curious) and one of the boys in a relationship with a girl was asked if he would ever be tempted by other girls. 
We got to discussing this and I said ""Well everyone gets tempted. What matters is resisting temptation for the sake of your relationship"" 

He immediately got angry and said that meant I have been tempted before and that means I am disloyal. 

I have never been tempted by another man - in all honesty I think what I said was kind of stupid because I MEANT that anyone CAN be tempted. Being tempted doesn't make you a bad person. 

We've had misunderstandings about other things (unrelated to fidelity - about completely random topics) because I often mix up my words and say something that means something slightly different to what I meant. That's honestly what happened here. 

I told him this and he doesn't believe me. He started grilling me on loads of things like have I ever found another man sexually attractive, have I ever wanted to sleep with another man, do I ever think of dating other men etc...

Whatever I tell him he won't believe me, he says what I said was a 'red flag' And he thinks I want to sleep with other men and doesn't fully trust me now. 

I'm kind of baffled - in our whole relationship neither one of us has been the slightest bit disloyal - we both have very strong opinions on fidelity and loyalty. I've never so much as spent time with another man in our whole relationship that wasn't my brother. I see men at work but it's on a colleague level only which he knows. 

I don't understand how a poor choice of words can be a red flag... I think I just need opinions. 

Thanks 

TL;DR husband seems to be suspicious of things I say for no reason. Accused me of cheating and says I am exhibiting red flags because I said anyone can be tempted by other men/women. "
"Me (27f) with my fiance(30m), together five years. Found some concerning texts to his sister.


I apologize in advance for how long this is and how jumbled my thoughts are here. I'm really overwhelmed at the moment and just need some guidance.

My fiance has been miserable and distant for quite some time. I've tried talking to him about it, giving him space, suggesting that he see a doctor, etc etc etc. Nothing ever happens, nothing is discussed. I say something, he stonewalls me, then acts as if the conversation never happened. I finally got sick of the guesswork and decided to try and find some information for myself. (Pretty shitty, I'm perfectly aware of that, and I understand that my doing so will probably over-shadow my findings. That unfortunately doesn't take away my concern.)

I only looked briefly at the people he's been texting, and peeked at the convos between him and his best friend because I know that he opens up to him about things more than he does for me. Didn't find anything more than the normal talk about their hobbies so I was just going to call it a day, but for some reason I decided to look at the texts between him and his sister.

For background, I have a seven year old daughter from  a previous relationship, and we have a three year old daughter together. Both were not intentional. (Don't worry, I'm permanently done having children.) I guess her and her boyfriend were discussing children, and was asking him some questions about parenting. Everything he said was just straight awful. He at one point said something along the lines of ""I would never recommend having a child, ever.""

Some of the other things that were said in a nutshell is that without children he would have time to do all of the things that he loves and that he is miserable from having to follow them around and clean up after them and watch them. These things both really upset me because for one, he barely even helps (I work out of the house 50 hrs/wk, do all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, and some of the yardwork) and I encourage him to go out with his friends and do his hobbies all the time (I am always taking the kids to things by myself, leaving him with a lot of alone time). Second, my oldest isn't with us primarily (""lives"" with her dad but I have her 3-4 days a week).

He said some pretty awful things about my oldest as well. I'll admit that she has been incredibly difficult since she was born, but he said that while he enjoys doing things with our 3 year old, his mood is ruined as soon as my seven year old comes around which hurt me a lot. She's a handful and sometimes the things she says really puts a damper on things but she's still young. She's not a terrible kid, just lies about dumb stuff and has a tendency to be oddly manipulative.

I don't know what to do here. I obviously can't talk to him about it because it was totally wrong of me to see his conversations to begin with, and I'm stuck with him. I have a decent job but his car is in my name so I wouldn't have that to get back and forth to work, I wouldn't have a place to live, and his grandma lives right by us so she watches our daughter for us while we work because I definitely couldn't afford child care. Plus I don't even know if this is a valid excuse for leaving him, but I don't want to live with someone so miserable with their life. We all vent about things - is this any different? I'm heartbroken tho, and at a total loss. Honestly, I wish I would've just found out that he was cheating on me.

tl;dr fiance sent a slew of text messages to his sister outlining all the ways that he is completely miserable being a parent. They're incredibly hurtful and I don't know how to proceed."
"Just caught my (24f) boyfriend (24m) of 4 years cheating with 16 year old and not sure how to proceed


(Throwaway because my bf knows my Reddit name)

First some background info. So my boyfriend Chase (name changed) has been hanging out for at least several months now with a 16 year old girl Emily (name changed) and her family. Of course, I thought it was weird at first, like most people probably would. But he convinced me that he was really more friends with her parents (her dad started teaching him how to tattoo and stuff), and that he saw her as like a little sister to him. I went over to their house with him when they first started hanging out and it really did seem like as normal and non-alarming of a thing as possible. So I went against my better judgement and trusted him. No alarm bells until recently. 

I started noticing a while ago that he wanted to spend more time over there. Then recently he started FaceTiming Emily semi regularly and texting her. I was starting to become concerned. He assured me that he could never 
have romantic feelings towards someone that young and that he just wanted to be a friend to her, etc.
 
Tonight after he was supposed to be going to sleep upstairs while I stayed up downstairs. After Chase went upstairs I could faintly hear him talking to someone on the phone. I realized it was the Emily. I thought I heard him refer to her as adorable. I couldn’t get that out of my head, and when I went up to bed later he was sleeping. I decided to read Chase’s texts. I know that that’s not a good thing to do but I really wanted to convince myself that I was being paranoid. I wasn’t. Chase told her that we had broken up and were just roommates. I don’t know how long they’ve been dating but it’s been long enough for them to tell them they love each other, but not long enough for them to have had sex (thank god for that for her). 

I feel really stupid for not realizing sooner, but I just didn’t think Chase had it in him to betray me like this. And also I didn’t want to think he could be SO FUCKING PREDATORY. 

I’m still processing this. I just discovered this no more than an hour ago. I’m planning to confront him tomorrow and message her telling her about his lies. Should I try to tell her parents? I don’t know if they know, but Chase seems to think they don’t in his messages. She’s also above the age of consent where I live, if that matters. 

Any advice as to what I should do and how I can get over this would be appreciated. I feel awful. Like, this is the dude I was planning on marrying.

TLDR: Just discovered that my lying cheating boyfriend is dating a 16 year old and am in need of advice

"My mother in law is driving me nuts about giving her a grandchild … am I being unreasonable?


Before my husband (M/31) and I (F/32) got married my mother in law (F/55) and I had a good relationship, I’d visit her occasionally while my husband was at work, occasionally we would talk over the phone (although she’d do all the talking as I am not much of a phone person).

Things changed a few months before we got married, all she would talk about was when would we give her a grandchild, my response would always be ""Can we wait until after the wedding??"" This is all she would talk about and it got so much that my husband (fiancé at the time) had to tell her to stop. This left a bad taste in my mouth and quite honestly pushed me away to where I did not want to visit her or call her over the phone (of course we wanted kids but we weren’t even married yet and having to hear her pester us about kids quite frankly got annoying).

After we got married the baby talk/questions started happening again. Every single time my husband calls her or when we visit her that is all she asks for, and no matter how many times she asks for a grandchild it’s not like we can pull one out of a baby store, getting pregnant is not as easy as it sounds.

My husband can’t control his mother, it’s not his fault quite frankly no one can, as she is who she is, does what she wants to, and says what she feels like. Now she’s complaining to my husband that I don’t call or visit her anymore. He backs me up every single time.

Am I being unreasonable to be seriously annoyed at her? I guess I am venting here but also inquiring if anyone has experienced this and had any resolution?

FYI My husband and I have both told her to stop, we’ve both told her that having a baby is not as easy as walking into a store, quite honestly nothing we say works. This would be her first grandchild. I would love to just ignore her until we get pregnant but I think this would start a feud.

**tl;dr MIL is driving me nuts about giving her a grandchild, am I being unreasonable?**    "
"Gf (27)(nurse) hasn't worked in over 1.5 years despite her ""applying for jobs"" although I don't think she trying very hard. I'm out of patients.


My gf graduate a couple winters ago with a nursing degree and I (33M) thought finally now she can work and we can get going with our lives, however here we are a year and 8 months later and she has no job while I sit around waiting.

She says she's been applying but has had just one interview in the last year. I don't know what to think because nursing jobs are abundant here. It seems like she just isn't trying. I've expressed my concern numerous times and tried to offer suggestions but the result is more months of no progress.

I don't know what else I can do. I can't be with someone who has no purpose. We've been together for 7 years and I've spent most of that time waiting for her to finish school and then she finished almost 2 years ago and I'm still waiting.

I don't really want to break up with her but I can't wait around anymore to move on in life. I don't know what else to do at this point other than leave. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this situation. I'm at the point of giving her a deadline and I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do.


**TLDR:**
Gf barely trying to get a job. Been a long long time. I'm running out of patients. Thinking about ending long relationship. Help!"
"I (27M) am getting pressured into letting my extended family live with me. Even though my family is indebted to them, my extended family bullied me as a child so I am reluctant to do them any favours.


**TLDR: Extended family helped my family when we needed them the most, but treated us extremely poorly. Now, they expect me to return the favour, and I don't know if I can.** 

During my childhood, my family (mum, dad, sister, and I) went through a rough period where both my parents were severely hurt at work and we had to sell the family home just to cover the expenses. As a result, for a few years, we bounced around the homes of our relatives (free of charge). Because of this, my extended family has looked down on our family. I would even go so far to say that they bullied us. They would often make rude jokes at the expense of my parents. 

Exacerbating their attitude was the fact that I struggled, behaviourally and academically, as a child. My extended family conflated success with an individual's worth, so I was often belittled, even as a child. One time we were celebrating one of my cousin's getting a full scholarship into a prestigious school. One uncle looked at me and said, ""don't worry, I'm sure &lt;cousin's name&gt; will get you a job as a secretary in the medical clinic she'll open up in the future"". My cousin added, ""I don't know, maybe a janitor position instead"". I remember everyone laughing, and my mum just gripping my hand tight. I was 12.   


My family eventually moved into a new home, but it was a small 1 bed room place that could not house all of us. I used this as motivation to turn my studies around, and I eventually landed a job in finance at the age of 20. For the next half a decade, I saved every single cent I can in order to buy my family a proper house. Earlier this year, I put down a deposit for a nice eight bedroom place. 

The problem started when my extended family found out that I let my GF's two siblings move in with me because the house is close to their university. My extended family is now pressuring for me to allow three of the kids in the extended family to also move in. On one hand, all of the kids in question, and their parents, treated me and my family like absolute dirt (which included the cousin and uncle aforementioned). On the other hand, they did help out my family when we needed it most.  


So, should I let bygones be bygones? Or should I stand up for myself and my family? "
"My roommate [22 F] is extremely prudish/awkward/weird around guys and it’s getting uncomfortable to live with


So I have three roommates, all girls. Two of them have boyfriends, I am currently single (but date around a bit) and then there’s “Hannah” who’s never even kissed a guy and is extremely prudish and weird around them. I felt sorry for her at first but after many embarrassing and quite frankly annoying outbursts its getting out of hand.

For example, a few weeks ago my roommates new boyfriend was walking from the shower back to his girlfriends room just wrapped in a towel around his waist. He casually passed Hannah in the corridor and she literally screamed in disgust and cowered away as if he was some sort of monster! She then said she wasn’t going to use that shower again until my roommate cleaned it with disinfectant because she thought him and my roommate had had sex in the shower. My roommate’s boyfriend felt quite uncomfortable at Hannah’s reaction to him just walking between rooms in a towel and told his girlfriend he dish what to stay over at ours anymore.

Another example is I once brought a guy home I didn’t know that well (we’d only had a couple of dates) and when we went to my room in the evening Hannah yelled from outside the door in a whiny, babyish voice “are you guys having sex?”. I was so embarrassed and didn’t say anything, so then she added “because if you are can you please make sure I can’t hear anything!”. I’ve never had noisy sex before so it seemed totally unreasonable, and if she felt the need to say something couldn’t she have just text me rather than yelled it in front of my guy?! It was such a mood killer!

Then there are just lots of little things. Like she will squeal in an alarmed way and cover her eyes if she sees any of us giving a guy a peck on the lips when he leaves, and make a disgusted face and run away if she walks into the room and hears any of us having a conversation between us about guys. We also had some guy friends over at our house recently and we wanted a group photo, but Hannah refused to put her arms casually around any of the guys despite the fact she knows them and that’s how the rest of us were posing. 

She gives no explanation or apology for her weird behaviour and it’s becoming a real problem for the rest of us. I don’t feel like I can bring new guys home with her always creating an uncomfortable and embarrassing environment for them - they get weirded out! My roommates’ boyfriends hardly ever come over because she makes them feel so uncomfortable. I get some people naturally are just a bit prudish, but I don’t understand why she needs to react in the completely over-the-top way she does in front of them - couldn’t she just keep her thoughts to herself?! I really can’t understand what her problem is or how we can manage her behaviour better. Any insight or suggestions would be appreciated!!

Tl;dr: roommate is extremely prudish/weird/awkward around guys and makes embarrassing over-the-top reactions in front of any guys we invite over to our house as if she is literally repulsed by them. It makes our boyfriends/guys we’re getting to know feel weirded out to the point where they feel uncomfortable about coming back. What do you think her issue is and how can we deal with it?! "
