"When hookups treat you like their boyfriend for the night


Long story short I hooked up with this guy, we got to his place, I rode him and he didn’t kick me out afterwards. He actually made us dinner, we watched a movie and fell asleep in each other’s arms. I’m actually shook because this has never happened to me with a hookup before!"

In the latest episode, ""Mr. Ratburn's Special Someone"", Mr. Ratburn prepares for his wedding. His class thinks he's getting married to [his controlling sister, played by guest star Jane Lynch](https://i.imgur.com/Y4t513m.png), before it's revealed that it's just his sister. There's no mention of ""gay"" whatsoever; it's treated as a normal wedding occasion, and the class is just happy he's marrying a nice person."
"20 reasons my husband is amazing


&amp;#x200B;

1. He deals with all the administration things in my life that I can't
2. Thanks to his tough love and sensible advice, I have money in my bank account for the first time in my life
3. He knows when I'm tired and I need to go to bed
4. He puts weeks of effort and thought into every gift he gives me, and I know the effort it took 
5. He wants every place we go out together to be meaningful and for us to have an amazing experience together - not just because we're bored
6. He'll tell me truths I might not want to hear because he loves me
7. He makes an effort with all my work colleagues and they know and appreciate him
8. He's moved out of his comfort zone so many times for me I can't count them
9. He'll get into shows or movies I like so we can share the experience, even if it isn't his first choice
10. He doesn't stand for wasting money or calories on pointless things, and it pays off for us as a couple
11. He used to not want me to wear his clothes, but now he's fine with it and encourages me to do so, and now we buy clothes to share
12. He'll tell me the truth no matter what the issue or circumstances, so I know he's never lying to me
13. Everything he buys, he thinks about us and our house
14. He's always working incredibly hard to get us the best deal at the best price, and make the most of every credit card and benefit out there
15. He appreciates the value of quality time spent together
16. He won't stand for any of his family members or friends not accepting or including me, or us as a couple
17. He makes an effort with my family all the time
18. He makes sure I know he loves me, no matter what
19. He understands the things I want to achieve in life, and helps me do them
20. He reminded me it was my Cake Day, even though I'd forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

There's a million reasons more, but those are 20 that came to me now. I know perfectly well not all the men out there are like him, that's why I appreciate him, that's why I love him, and that's why I think he's amazing."
"Gaybros: Being gay is not a personality trait. Also gaybros: I'm straight-acting.


Isn't there anyone else who has some dissonance about this mentality?"

"The gay agenda needs more Pete Buttigieg types and less James Charles types, don't you think?


SNL called Pete Buttigieg a ""boring gay man"" but you know... that's what *normal* people are. Including gay men.

Then we have the opposite... polarizing clowns like James Charles. Decent gay people are actually embarrassed by James and people like him.

I'm all in favor of less ""fabulous"" and more ""boring."""

"Hug your cat (or dog) tight tonight...


Just put down my best friend of 14 years.  I had him since the day he was born in my closet 14 years ago... until he died in my arms tonight.  He was a pretty unique cat... some people said he was part dog lol.  He loved attention, loved to play rough, and was always super affectionate.  No matter where I was in the house... he'd follow me.  He even jumped into the shower with me every now and then lol.  He'd jump into my bed every morning... and snooze with his big head between my shoulder and my neck.  He eventually got sick (cancer) and the last few months have been hard... as he slowly began to show signs of suffering.  The last few days were really bad... I knew I had to let him go... but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  Tonight I knew the time had come... and I finally had no choice but to let go and say good bye.

Over the last 14 years... not a day went by that I wasn't aware about how lucky I was.  I never took him for granted.  But I always felt like... he'd be around for ever.  It's funny how things like this really put ""time"" in perspective.  ""Years from now"" always seems so far away.  But it eventually comes.

We had such a unique relationship... that I'm not sure I'll ever get with any other pet.  Fuck I'm gonna miss that little guy.

If you have a special cat or dog in your life... hug him or her tight tonight.  And remember to enjoy every moment with them."
"I fucking got played so bad on grindr


This guy texted me this morning and wanted to hookup and we exchanged pictures, had similarities in sexual desires , etc. 

Agreed to meet him, he said he can host at a hotel (room 231) and gave me the address (also sent me his location through the app!). The hotel was only a couple miles away so I showered and got ready. We were to meet at 2pm and headed over around 1:45pm. Got there and messaged him again. He told me to find the room and I did. Then he said just to knock and he'll open it so I did that. AND this random guy opens the door and had to tell him that I have the wrong room. It was so awkward
I FELT SO FUCKING STUPID AND EMBARRASSED!

This guy was literally spoofing his location, made me go to a random hotel room and wasted so much of my time. He blocked me when I asked him again if I had the wrong room number. 

Has anyone else ever had this happen? This is just plain fucking stupid, I also have a feeling it might've been my ex just to get back at me. But idk I feel so stupid"
"I knew I liked guys when:


As a teenager... dark armpit hair on a hot athletic guy, it shows he'd arrived. I remember seeing it  on highschool basketball players, and if guy was hot, damn. But I never connected it to bring gay; just ""liked"" the look 😂 lol. If only, lol"
"I think the obsession with Straight guys thing is creepy


So, one aspect of the James Charles drama that came to light was him apparently pressuring """"""straight boys""'"""" into making out with him. I'm not going to comment on that because I don't really know anything about the situation, but it just kind of reminds me of how a lot of gay men in the gay community fetishize straight boys in this way.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very similar to when straight guys fetishize lesbians, but roles are switched for gay guys and straight guys. I find it really creepy...like how could you really be severely attracted (beyond just admiring aesthetics) to someone who could never be that intimate with you? And it's worse too when like, you specifically only go for straight guys. Our community is so small as it is, and it's disheartening to know that it's made even smaller by guys who dismiss all other gay men as ""undateable""."

"Equality Act - The House just passed a sweeping LGBTQ rights bill! (US politics)

It will likely fail in the Senate, but this is huge to me.  The names of the Senators that vote against it will be on record.  Susan Collins for example who may be in trouble."
"I'm feeling good


I always felt really bad about the size of my penis (12 cm / 4.7 inches) and was afraid of topping someone. Last friday my boyfriend cummed hands free and I felt really good. He said it felt amazing and that I had nothing to worry about because it was more than enough to please him. So any bros out there who are feeling bad about their sizes, forget about them. Find someone who likes it. Everybody has preferences. Ignore the hate."
"Came out as bi to my friend (in Mississippi)


Made some ribs in a slow cooker (once you've had slow cooker ribs, there's no going back.).  Made too many so I invited him over.  Wasn't planning on coming out.  We were eating and I said ""oh yeah man, by the way I actually found out I'm bisexual"".  

He was shocked, to say the least, as the way I am, I come across as a completely straight man.  He asked ""so how do you know?"" Nonchalantly I said, ""Well, I fuck girls, and i fuck guys too."".  He said ""well alright man.  You definitely seem happy with it"".  

He told me he's experimented with toys before, and that he had also thought at one point he might be gay.  This is something that while I wouldn't have guessed, it did make sense once he said it. 

We drank beer and watched some YouTube stuff and talked for several hours.  He was completely cool with me being bi.  He was curious about some stuff, and I answered completely honestly. 

He made some funny jabs too like I was chewing tobacco and he said ""So you spit?"" I said ""only tobacco.""  At one point we were talking about our old boss (we knew each other from work.  We had both quit.)  And he said ""I wonder what his price is to blow another man"" and I said ""probably a new car.  But for me it's pretty much free""  we both had a food laugh at these.

Being bi, it was also fun to trade stories about the girls we've been with.  

We had a great time.  He's a good friend."
"I can’t believe this is even real right now


Sorry probably a lengthy post incoming but I am so giddy and excited and don’t have any friends really to share this with so yeah that’s why I’m here lol.

I’m 17 years old and so far in the closet I’d need a rescue team of 30 professionals to get me out. My parents are immigrants from Chile and pretty catholic. I’ve no clue what their reaction to me being gay would be, but given their values and how I’ve heard my family talk about gay people in the past I don’t think it would be a good reaction. Most likely far from it. 

We moved to Canada 10 years ago with another family that is very close to ours. They have a son who is my age and also my lifelong friend. His name is Felix. We had lived in one house when we initially came to Canada for a couple years until mine and Felix’s  parents could establish themselves and we could live on our own. Despite moving out we still found homes close enough so that we could be neighbours.  

Felix and I have helped each other through everything. Through schooling, through learning English, through picking up and learning different hobbies (whenever our families could afford to). We were and essentially still are attached by the hip. 

When we both went through the stages of puberty we had each other to kind of relate to. We talked about girls (lol) and the typical run of the mill stuff you do when you’re pubescent and curious. We never experimented with each other  but we used to shower together to be save on water bills when we first got to Canada so we’ve always been just very comfortable with ourselves. At around 15 I pretty much realized that I liked guys and the idea fucking terrified me because of my parents and having to be “different”. I was also terrified because I realized my attraction through Felix as I was becoming infatuated by him and just couldn’t stop thinking about him.

While I was quietly and secretly falling for Felix he got his first girlfriend! That hit me pretty hard but he’s straight and I have to respect that and he’s my lifelong friend so whatever, it’s my job to get over my feelings and deal with it. He was also extremely considerate and never turned into that one guy everyone knows that just spends ALL his time with his girlfriend, so we still maintained our close friendship because he made sure we could.

Fast forward to last weekend. Him and his girlfriend got into a huge fight (their relationship had been having its ups and downs recently) and she dumped him. He was beside himself and really really upset. I did my best to cheer him up. I surprised him the morning after it happened with breakfast from Tim Hortons (nothing crazy but I know he likes their sandwiches) and we played video games all day. I slept over and the next day we went outside to take his dog for a walk and after coming back inside I went to his room while he cleaned the dogs paws. I was just looking at something on his computer when I heard him walk in and close the door behind him. When I turned 
 he moved towards me grabbed me by the hips and kissed me!!!!!

HE KISSED ME!!!!! I was so shocked and my stomach was in my chest and obviously I kissed him back but after a few seconds I stopped and I asked him what the hell is happening right now. I think that startled him because he started apologizing and asking if that was okay and he should’ve said something or asked. I interrupted him to say no its okay its just a surprise I don’t understand he had a girlfriend he’s straight etc and he stopped me to say that was the reason that they broke up. That he lost attraction and realized that he might not be into girls as much as he thought and knew that when I spent the whole weekend that I was extremely special to him and he felt like he always had feelings for me but never knew how to say anything because he wasn’t sure if I was into boys and given both our backgrounds it’s also really terrifying to admit to ourselves that we are gay.

I started tearing up as he rambled on and my heart was beating so fast I just kissed him again and we made out for a good like 15 minutes before we stopped to talk about it some more. We didn’t do any under the clothes stuff because we want to take this gradually as it’s already a bit overwhelming but holy CRAP I have never been happier in my entire life.

Every time I think about him I can’t help but smile and I feel like falling for your best friend and having your best friend fall for you is so special and I never thought this would happen to me.

I know I kind of rambled on and a lot of these sentences are run on sentences but !!!!!!!  Uejahaisbfuhwhw it’s just so awesome I’m so happy that even though  I have such a heavy secret to keep I have a person I love and trust most in the world to keep it with.  Now we just have to be careful to not change the way we act in front of each others parents lol but I think we can do it. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I hope everyone has an amazing day!!"
"Thanks, to you guys and this sub


I just wanted to come back to post a thank you for everybody here who commented on my [post from last fall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9cjwv3/advice_dealing_with_my_son/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

&amp;#x200B;

The short recap version is, last year the older of my two sons went into a spiral, breaking off his engagement, having problems at work, getting kicked out of where he was living because he started having sex with men at all hours, and (we found out later) some drug use.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no fucking idea who to ask for help, but a friend pointed me here and I posted. I honestly didn't think it would do anything but I was operating off my own limited knowledge and prejudices. And the answers I got blew me away, to be honest. They helped us put the pieces together and helped me reconnect with my son.

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting too specific, it was a combination of pressures related to him suppressing the truth, that he is gay. He had been experimenting with drugs and it led to a breakdown. We got him help. It was a rough few months but we got through it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting this with his permission. He's living with me right now just to have a solid home base. I wasn't there for him as much as I should have been growing up, and now we're reconnecting. He's happy, healthy, and has a friend (who I am not allowed to call a boyfriend, yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

He visits this subreddit but I won't point him out. But he says it helps, being part of a community here.

&amp;#x200B;

I was raised in a pretty narrow minded way and I never thought in a million years we would end up where we did. We got help from a lot of people but it was you guys who got me thinking about things in the right way. Thanks guys."
