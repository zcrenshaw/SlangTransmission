"I can’t help myself, I’ve completely fallen for my straight best friend and I coerced him into giving me his underwear... am I a bad person?


So this weekend I was hanging out with my straight best friend, he looks almost exactly like Henry Cavill and I tried really hard to keep my feelings in check but it doesn’t work. 

He teases me and takes his shirt off whenever we’re together because he knows I’m gay and he obviously knows I have a thing for him 

Well yesterday he let me spend the night because we stayed up late playing video games and drinking bear and at some point he started stripping. He said it was hot, but he had functioning A/C so I know he must have secretly wanted me to make a move 

That’s when I went in for the kiss and he punched me in my face... he said sorry and begged me to forgive him for being homophobic and I told him he had to give me a pair of his... 

I’m just kidding, it’s just been a while since we’ve had our daily “str8 best friend” post... was just filling the gap and holding it down. As is tradition. Enjoy the rest of your day fellow gays... leave a like if you thought it was real for a split second uwu"

"My ""straight"" best friend's wife wrote me, asking me to stop having sex with her husband : UPDATE


So many of you offered support, criticism, disgust, etc.. I felt I should update you on the situation. 

My friend and I typically meet up once a week if our schedules allow. I flew back home Wednesday night and confirmed my meet up with him for Thursday. At this point,I still had not decided what course of action to take. Selfish me wanted to not say anything and just keep things going like they have been. The guilty me felt a need to tell my friend what was up, but still not knowing how. Selfish me won and I met up with my friend like nothing changed. When we were saying goodnight, guilty me took over and I showed him the letter. His reaction wasn't what I expected. He read it, said nothing, then left. I figured he needed time to process the situation and it would be best if I left him alone to do so. He is my best friend after all and I want to be there for him if he needs support, even if the situation has a lot to do with me. An hour after he left, he sent me a text asking to come back. He looked pretty calm and didn't seem to be upset, but he wanted to talk. In a nutshell, the letter was the best thing that could have happened for him. He's been looking for a way out of the marriage for years, but too weak and too scared to face who he really is and what he's wanted for a very long time. He insisted that the lack of sexual activity in his marriage was his wife's choice, and her disinterest in sex made it easier for him to seek sex elsewhere and not feel guilty about it. They don't communicate as a couple should, and they've been faking it far too long.  As I suspected, I am not the only man he's been with. He told me he's been struggling with his sexual identity for a long time, trying to convince himself he's bi-sexual and finally accepting  himself as a gay man only recently. He's tired of the charade, the lies and the sneaking around. He's been hooking up with other men responsibly for years, but wanted me to feel special since I was his 1st. He had this idea that I would be upset if I wasn't the only one. Baffling! He insisted that he has always practiced safe sex and gets tested regularly. I was a little hurt to tell you the truth. He's been lying to his wife and to me, but I have to accept that he was struggling. I just don't understand how he didn't trust me enough,his best friend and the man he's been seeing for over 12 years, with his sexual identity struggles. he obviously needs some work on communicating.   He's going to show his wife the letter, admit to her that he's gay and then file for divorce. We have no plans to be together. The last thing he needs is to be in another relationship ,and we agreed that its something neither of us want at this time. He's going to move out of their house and start living  the life he's wanted to live for years.  For me, I'm happy my friend is no longer going to be living in a lie of a marriage, I'm happy that I'll get to see my friend become who he really is. I do think our time together is also at an end. We don't want to be together romantically and I think its time to put this affair behind me and try to just be his friend. Thanks again for all you support, even the ugliest of comments helped me face what a fucked up situation the entire affair was."
"Misconception


You can be LGBTQ+ and be a racist, rapist, misogynist, nazi, bigot, predator, pedophile, religious extremist, islamaphobic, transphobic, homophobic and all other kinds of evil, hateful swine. Just because you belong to a sexual orientation or gender identity that is ostracized and discriminated against, doesn’t make you a victim or innocent. 

Being LGBTQ+ isn’t a belief, a quality or a state of mind. You are not automatically an empathetic, kind, sensitive, open-minded, accepting person just because you’ve experienced some mistreatment and assumed to have learned to be a better person from it. Your sexual orientation and gender identity cards don’t redeem you from being a piece of shit garbage person.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk."

"Anybody else not closeted, but not really out either?


I’m not sure if this’ll makes sense. I’ve long accepted that I’m gay, and I’m not afraid to come out to others. However, I don’t feel the need to blurt out that I am gay, unless asked specifically or it comes up naturally in conversation. Only 3 people know I’m gay because of this lol. I’m just curious. Is anybody else in a similar situation where you’re not closeted, but also not out?"
"My first boyfriend!


After nearly a year of being ghosted and stood up by assholes, I can finally say that I have my first official boyfriend! He asked me yesterday and I haven't stopped smiling since. He's an incredible guy who's affectionate, charming, and respectful. He captivates me in ways I didn't even know possible.

  


I know these posts are a dime a dozen, but if this encourages anyone else out there struggling to be in their first relationship, then it's worth it.

"What now? (dealing with death)


Too Long, didn't read version:

&amp;#x200B;

My husband died. We'd been together for 22 years. It was a horrible death. He had a reaction to the blood thinner the hospital gave him. He went in the hospital with a normal body and came missing both feet and a hand. My husband came home after spending two and a half months in the hospital because of a reaction to heparin missing three limbs. My husband died three months later.

.

I feel selfish for feeling loss. My husband lost everything. I feel guilty for going on. I feel regret for missed opportunities. I feel weak because we talked about this stuff and I know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I have to put a face on every morning because no one wants to deal with a sourpuss.

.

Long version:

.

Well, I'm a widower. Late March my husband died. We'd been together for 22 years---married for three. I remember when the USSC decision allowing marriage happened. We were sitting on the couch watching the news. He looked over at me and said, ""I guess we'll get married."" I said, ""Yes, but it will have to wait till after the first of next year. I didn't think they'd let us."".

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't the most romantic marriage decision, but after being with someone for 19 years we knew we were together for life. Don't mistake me. We loved each other deeply. Our commitment was enduring, not convenient. In fact, we often joked with each other that if either of us should pass, neither of us would seek out a new partnership. I know that I would have his blessing now if I wanted a new relationship; As he knew that if I should die first he had my blessing to form a new partnered-life. .

.

A marriage is rather inconvenient if you truly love someone. Anything of value takes a dedication of resources that could have been otherwise used on yourself---if you didn't value this thing more. Love takes a lot of energy.

.

I don't regret my life with my spouse. I miss him dearly.  22 years of our story has ended and now my story continues----And a glorious 22 years we had! Together we hiked most of the national parks in the continental US. My sweetie had a fear of flying so we only left the states twice together. We built our house with our 4 hands and 4 feet. We spent hours commuting together to our respective jobs just shooting shit. And silliness, I remember the time a dump-truck pulled out in front of us when there was nothing behind us. I said, ""Sweet, pass that fellow. please.""  He did. As we drove passed him I rolled down my window, shot a bird, and screamed, ""Asshole!"" at the top. of my lungs.  It didn't take too long to realize that the dump-truck was empty and pissed. We drove several miles wit.h an angry dump-truck on our bumper. My Dear Husband (DH) decided to drive at break-neck speed away and turned down a side road. I learned a valuable lesson, ""Never start something you aren't willing to finish."" DH was never a bore.

&amp;#x200B;

He was the kindest human I've met. He literally spent the last six months of his life bedridden due to bad decisions by a doctor. During that time, he spent his time on the internet helping people. I'm not talking about chatting. I'm talking about committing money and resources----buying things for people that he knew needed them----or just sending a gift to a friend to pick up their day. To be clear, My DH went into the hospital with 2 normal hands and 2 normal feet. Due to bad decisions by his doctor, DH left the hospital with one hand and no feet. He died three months later. During his ordeal, he was the most positive, non-judgemental person.

&amp;#x200B;

After he died, his co-worker received three boxes. DH worked at a central office of a non-profit and would have to visit several peripheral locations.  His co-worker told me, ""I know that he wanted me to take these to some of our co-workers, but I don't know who------"" DH died before he had a chance to tell his co-worker who the gifts were for.

&amp;#x200B;

22 years of him-and-me-----I don't know how to do just ""me"". What now? All relationships end (I'm not quibbling with those of you who subscribe to a metaphysical afterlife). I don't know if that makes all life tragic. Maybe the same advice applies to me as to anyone dumped. I don't know. It may be hubris to think that my situation is different. I'm not doing a relationship again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I know I was truly loved. I have the money from life insurance. I have the money from the bank account. I have to fill out paperwork from the stocks, and for his 401K, and for the policy his parents took out as a child. . . I'd give it all for 2 more hours with him."
"Advice please. I'm a man in a straight marriage with kids, but now realizing I'm definitely not straight.


I don't even know where to start, so I'll just start rambling and hopefully this all makes sense.

I'm at least bi, maybe even gay. I'm a man, married to women, both in early 30s. We have two boys and a girl, all under age 6. Before we had kids, I told my wife that I'm bi. I didn't hide it from her, it was more that I hadn't even realized it about my self. She took it well, asked me if I wanted an out. I declined because I truly loved her, she is a wonderful person. 

Looking back on it, I was just in a world of denial. Hugely. Half a dozen gay encounters as a kid and teen. But I have one to two actual hetero relationships and of course that means I'm straight (ugh, I'm dumb).

Here is the issue I'm having. This non-hetero side of me is now eating me up. I refuse to cheat on my wife. We would have to separate or she would have to be open to an open relationship. I think about men *all the time*. I'm starting to interpret other interactions with strangers who are men as flirty when if I'm being honest with my self that cannot be the case, simply from a statistical perspective.

Factors that really are killing me/making this all harder:

1) my wife is a good person

2) my wife deserves someone who she makes happy and who is made happy by being with her (both at the same time). It's not that I'm not happy with her. It's that it is feeling like it isn't enough. There's just a hole there. The analogy is that (if I'm even bi?) I have two sides, one of which she completely fulfills while the other is a gaping maw of lost emotional connection that I'm craving with men.

3) I have zero eyes for other women. Zero. So another thing that makes me question if I'm just flat out gay.

4) I have so much guilt about how breaking up would be so unfair to my children. I have equal questions that maybe NOT breaking up is just as unfair. I love them so much and the thought of my son asking my wife ""where is daddy?"" if we were to split... I don't have words for the ache in my soul.

5) I have zero desire for the hook up scene.

6) I come from a highly religious family. Coming out would mean being cut off from most of them. I can actually deal with this, but it hurts.

7) I have a higher profile job with good salary, but have significant debt due to this. I worry how financially alimony would wreck me due to the debt. I know this is superficial but hey debt is debt whether you're gay or not. Being out as gay or bi in my line of work, at least in my city, is a definite NO GO. 

8) I see how attempting an open relationship or breaking up with my wife will destroy her emotionally. Maybe almost permanently. She is so undeserving of this that it makes me sick thinking about it. It also sucks because we focused on my career while she decided to be a stay at home mom. She is so capable that I also feel so much guilt about how if I weren't such an idiot she could have pursued something, too.

9) I am not suicidal and I *won't* kill my self. But I wouldn't lie if I didn't think how this would be easier if I were dead. Death happens, but it isn't a rejection. And my family would get millions in life insurance.

10) I don't know where to go from here. As I said I cannot be out in my city, so I just don't even know where to go regarding a counselor who is both knowledgeable about LGBT stuff but also marriage as it relates to one person coming out.

Any advice, anecdotes, anything at all would be appreciated. Also if there is another sub I should post on, please LMK. Thanks everyone."

"Were you bullied at school for being gay while not knowing it was for that reason?


I honestly didn't know why kids were mean to me on Junior High. It took years for me to realize it was because I wasn't just gay but flamboyant. I remember my years at Junior High and it's like getting to the end of the puzzle, it finally makes sense whereas at the time  it didn't, I just assumed it was because I was chubby. Yes, I was called the F word but every kid who got bullied was called that word as well."
"My son is apparently going to come out to me soon and I don't know how to handle the situation


My wife has told me that our son had come out to her and she told me that he was going to come out to me soon (lol don't think she was supposed to tell me that). This probably makes sense since she's always been fairly liberal and outspoken in her views while I've been pretty quiet on the issue with my son as it's never come up 

Anyways, here we are. I never actually thought he was gay and never suspected it and never knew someone this close to me would be gay. I know it was a breach of trust that my wife told me beforehand but I'm glad she did as I really need time to prepare for this situation which is unexpected to say the least... I have no idea what dad joke I'm going to use. Should I go for the classic ""Hi gay I'm dad"", but what if he doesn't go for the exact phrasing ""I'm gay""? 

I'm honestly lost in this situation and could use some help, thanks :)"
"Introducing my husband to my parents has been hard


Hi guys. This is throw away for obvious reasons( I don't want my husband to read it) . I moved away from my home 14 years ago. I am 29 now. I went when I was 15 to study in the US since I managed to win a scholarship( well not exactly but it's too long and insignificant to the story to explain). After that my life just settled there which I am very happy about since my home isn't the best place to be when it comes to being gay. 

I came out to my parents over Skype a few years ago. They took it as a huge shock. They were always very homophobic like most people home and they couldn't believe it at first. Then they accepted it and we moved on. But they and especially my dad never really got over it. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I decided to get married to my long term boyfriend. I of course invited my whole family to be at my wedding. Unfortunately they didn't come. My mom has always been claustrophobic with a certain fear of planes to add and my dad didn't want to come because he felt he would be ""the odd one out"" since he doesn't speak English and said he would feel foolish among the other guests. My brother and sister haven't talked to me since I came out so they didn't come either.


The wedding was very nice although I had pain in my heart that my husband had 300 guests, 100 of which were family and I only had a few close friends from college. 


This year we had some time off since we'd been working really hard and decided to visit my family in my home country. So we came here a few days ago. But things haven't gone really well so far. Nothing specific happened but it's really awkward. Especially this vibe coming from my dad like he is totally uncomfortable every time we sit on the table. He just looks like a scared person.  He doesn't look uncomfortable as in an agressive or hateful way. He just looks like he is scared. He does weird things, drops stuff on the floor. I wonder if I should talk to him?


I also kind of heard my mom and him speak and it was like they were arguing and I heard it was about my husband and me but I couldn't hear specifics. Should I talk to them? My husband has also been feeling this vibe of awkwardness that comes. My mom tries to be nice but it's not really easy with the language barrier so I work as a translator too.


We ran into my brother on the street yesterday. He was with his wife and children. He was always the perfect examplary son. We were passing and he just looked at me for a fraction of a second and turned his eyes away. His wife however recognised me and stop and told him ""hey, look!"". And he was like ""I saw. Let's go."" And she said ""oh, come on!"" And he was like "" LET'S GO!"". At this point I was standing still and looking at them. So his little son( who is the cutest little angel I have ever seen) saw I was just standing next to them and asked ""who is that daddy?"". And my brother said ""no one"" and just pulled his wife and kids and walked away. I have never felt such a pain before. I just sat down on the sidewalk. I was so shaken. I started crying. My husband didn't even know what had just happened.

Sorry for the long rant. Any thoughts are appreciated!"
"I’m so happy, thank you.


So I wanted to say thank you.

Back on NYE I posted about how sad and lonely I was and how I was still a virgin at 32 and what do I do about it and how do or will I ever find someone to love me.

I received some awesome support, ideas and info from this group and I just took it one step at a time.

Well after a few months a lot of work on myself image and many dating apps later
I’ve found my boyfriend and I love him.

We have been dating 2 months and have soooo much in common. We both love computers and technology and have so much to chat about.

We also like our alone time so we are happy to be in the same room doing our own thing and we don't need to be in each other's pocket.

I write this now while he is sleeping in my arms 🤗
I’ve never felt sooo happy and loved.

I just wanted to say a huge thank you to this awesome community and subreddit for helping me find love.❤️"
"Why can't some people understand I don't want to shave my body hair?


I'm so annoyed by it. I have hair basically all over, and I like it. Still apparently nowadays this is not normal. What is wrong with people giving me unsolicited advice on how to get rid of it? Or my mom even wants to gift me waxing vouchers for my birthday (mid twenties), she went to a public pool the other day and ""literally every single man didn't have a single hair on his upper body"". I have to wax at least my back.

By now I think some people assume I am deeply ashamed of my body hair and I don't know how to get rid of it or am scared to do that or whatever. I know many gay guys might find back hair off putting but I don't. I actually like men who are hairy too. I could imagine getting rid of the back hair if a guy in a LTR says he doesn't like it, maybe he would have to do it lol. But otherwise no.

But lately these attacks seem to have some effect on my self esteem. (Although it may be crippled for other reasons.) Is it really okay to wear a tshirt which reveals a bit of chest and back hair? All while there are guys walking around shirtless in the city, or gals with shoulder free tops. I just get this kind of self concious and I think it's stupid because I don't really find this a valid reason and won't change my mind, but I hear it so often from some people that by now it's stuck in the head. (And I'm not talking about professional situations, but again why should only a hairless man be allowed to open up the top most button of this shirt...)"
"Went to pride for the first time... With my parents.


I'm 25 years old and came out to my parents about 2 years ago. My parents have been very supportive and this year they wanted to go to (Toronto) pride with me. I wasn't really interested in going since it's kinda outside of my comfort zone and I'm very out of touch with the gay ""scene"", but I agreed we'd stop by for a couple of hours since they really wanted to go. Couple of notes about my experience:

1. It was way busier than I expected. There were thousands of people and the streets were absolutely packed. (we didn't go the day of the main parade, just went to the festival).

2. There was way more nudity than I expected. Every where you looked it seemed there was an old naked dude. (My parents didn't seem to appreciate that) 

3. There were a lot more kids than I expected.

4. The entertainment was.... mediocre, and so were the vendors. Mind you, we probably just didn't catch any of the good entertainment. 

5. The environment felt very welcoming. As a ""masc"" dude I didn't really feel out of place.

6. I wish I had gone with a group of friends, and not my parents 😂


In conclusion, I'm happy I went. I would recommend going even if you think it would be lame (like I did). I would definitely go again, but not with my parents next time..."
"Parents still in denial about my brother being gay


My brother came out about 4 years ago when he was in high school. At the time, my parents brushed it off as a phase.

Fast forward to now, my brother has moved to Atlanta (6 hours away). On the news the other day there was something LGBT related and my parents started talking about it. Then my dad started saying things like ""i don't have a problem with gay people, it is just unnatural and i don't want someone i love to be gay because someone may hurt them"" (he was shading my brother). Then my mom goes ""is \*\*\*\*(my brothers name) gay?"" and then they both look at me and I just say probably. And they give me a confused look and shake their heads.

Anyways, if they still think that he isn't gay, what will they do when I come out? We are their only children. If they ""disown"" us they will be very lonely. 

When am I supposed to come out? it is awkward when they ask me about having a girlfriend and i make excuses as to why I don't have one."
"Do you ever look back on past interactions with ""straight"" friends who you later found out may not have been as straight as they made themselves out to be, and just sit there thinking to yourself, ""Ahh fuck, I should've made a move""?


I guess throughout most of highschool and into my early uni years when I was fairly deep in the closet, the majority of my crushes developed on straight friends. While they were usually unfounded, there have been a couple of times where I feel as though I could've struck gold. While I've been with and dated guys since, the bonds have never really felt as real or as strong as they have with the two main guys I was friends with between the ages of 17 and 20, and sometimes I wonder whether I should've bitten the bullet and tried to pursue something with them. 

The first guy I was pretty much best friends the majority of the senior year of high school. I found him somewhat attractive physically, but most of the attraction was based on the emotional side. The conversations would cover extremely personal topics most people wouldn't even cover with their S/O's. Anyway, he started dating a girl towards the end of our senior year, of whom was extremely jealous of the friendship. It was the main factor that led to the decline of the friendship, and over the next few years he was bitter towards me, similar to how an ex would act after a breakup. Since then we haven't really spoken, but I have heard rumours about him and guys through mutual friends, which makes me wonder whether anything would've happened had I have made a move. 

The second guy was in my football team and pretty much immediately filled the void the first guy left. With him the attraction was more physical due to him being the same height as me, a little more muscular but unbelievably stronger than I was. We never really had the full-on personal conversations I had with the first guy, but we got each other's humour a lot better, plus he was still fairly supportive and the personalities matched fairly well. What really got me into him was when we were wrestling on a trampoline while drunk, he pinned me on my stomach and dry-humped me on and off for about 10-15 minutes. At first the humping was more of a joke and we were both laughing as I struggled out of his grip, but I noticed he was hard as a rock and even tried to pull my pants down a couple of times. I was too deep in the closet to make a move at the time, and even convinced myself it was nothing, so I never spoke to him about it. Even though he was extremely touchy-feely over the next few months before I moved away for uni. Turns out he's lowkey bi, having found him on Grindr somewhat recently. 

Anyway... Does anyone else ever have times like these, where you feel as though you should've made a move? I hate dwelling on things like these, but even with the guys I've dated since, they still feel like the most real and natural bonds I've ever had with guys."
