"Are people looking for things to get offended by?


I saw this on Twiter today https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/1067972666622189568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1067972666622189568&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2Fliberal-outlet-mocked-for-saying-classic-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-is-sexist-and-bigoted%3Fcmpid%3Dprn_nypost
and I am sorry but I think this is the dumbest thing to get upset about. Yes the other reindeer and his father are mean but he saves the day and they all come to respect him and what makes him different. I do not see why this Christmas classic offended some people. I sometimes think some people just look for things to offend them or if it offends them then everyone has to be offended also and I a sorry it doe snot work like that. Does anyone else feel this way?"
"Boy Erased


I watched this last night with my gay friend and two of our straight guy friends. We all bawled our eyes out. It was such a painful, horrible, but touching and necessary movie. I‚Äôm so happy my straight friends went with us to support us and see a glimpse of what a lot of LGBT people go through. Even though I never went to conversion therapy, I was able to empathize with every single feeling that guy experienced.

My dad and I aren‚Äôt very open about me being gay, but I think I‚Äôm going to have us watch it together. 

Have you seen it? If not, go see it! It‚Äôs so sad how it‚Äôs only showing in select theaters. I live in Virginia, and we had to drive 45 minutes to the closest showing. In Arkansas, where the film takes place, only ONE theater in the whole state is screening it. It‚Äôs nearly 2019 ‚Äî fuck this convoluted, twisted, and bigoted form of ‚Äòreligion.‚Äô"

"Where‚Äôs the line between playful flirting and genuine sexual interest?


I‚Äôve recently been going to the gym with a guy I met on Grindr. Before we met he mentioned that he‚Äôs not into hookups and can be very shy before warming up to new people. A platonic gym bud was totally cool with me and we seemed to be on the same page. After a few workouts however, his messages to me and behavior at the gym became less platonic and more flirty. A compliment on my ass here, a little wink emoji in a text there. Nothing too heavy but it would definitely appear that he was into me more than friends. At one point I confessed that I had pigged out on burgers and he replied that he was going to ‚Äúspank that ass‚Äù as ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù. All of this had me thinking he‚Äôs finally warmed up to me and is now interested in something less platonic. What the hell else was I to think?

Our last workout together was easily above and beyond what one would consider light flirtation. Before we even left the locker room he was trying to convince me to ‚Äúgo commando‚Äù like he does. I told him I don‚Äôt need my dick flopping around in my gym shorts as I workout and brushed off his suggestion playfully. ‚ÄúPussy!‚Äù, he calls me. Alright then... Once on the gym floor it felt like our workout was 30% exercise and 70% flirting. It got to the point where he was slapping my ass and literally tickling me while I was trying to use the machines. It kind of made me embarrassed with all of the straight jocks in the gym noticing this gay foolishness off in the corner. After our workout he drove me home and while we were parked in my driveway I made a move and suggested we just makeout already. He looked terrified and genuinely shocked that I would suggest this. Clammed right up and told me ‚Äúsorry if I lead you on... you look disappointed...‚Äù I told him the look on my face was more bewilderment at all of the flirting and sexy texts he had sent me throughout the week than anything else. We touched on the ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùmisunderstanding‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù later that evening via texts, but I‚Äôm still sitting here utterly perplexed. We have plans tonight to hit the gym but I‚Äôm really unsure of how to play this all off. I‚Äôm super confused and his explanations for all the flirting and innuendos amount to ‚ÄúI was just going with the flow‚Äù. It just feels like he‚Äôs gaslighting me into believing I read into something that wasn‚Äôt there and mistook playfulness for sexual interest. That shit might work if I didn‚Äôt have text messages from him telling me ‚ÄúI want to see that ass when I spank it‚Äù. Am I losing my mind here or does this guy just have issues I‚Äôll never understand? How should I handle him at the gym if he keeps up all the touchy/feel-y nonsense? "
"Is it ok that I only like light skin guys?


I prefer just people of my own color or those with very light skin, the rest I find ugly to me, is it ok?"

Why do people always assume others are straight until proven otherwise? "

I need some counsel from you all. Incoming wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm a straight dude who is hit on/ flirted with by guys seemingly whenever I go out. I'm 5'10"" 145 lbs, minimal body hair and athletic/skinny build. I'm not every guys type but I fit a number of them.

 It bothers me not because I'm uncomfortable with it, it's actually super flattering, but rather because it's very inconvenient talking to a girl and she says, ""I have a friend I think you'd like to meet"" then it turns out to  be her best guy friend.

1) I feel shitty because I've been turned down by someone I'm interested in

2) I then have to turn down her friend that I'm not interested in who's been completely set up for me by someone they trust

&amp;#x200B;

It super sucks, and it happens often, on top of being offered drinks by fellas and turning them down. On top of being grabbed by guys and turning them down. On top of being asked to ""study/chill"" and turning them down.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a big tease and I'm sick of getting hurt and hurting others' feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

 Obviously it's not just random guessing, I can understand why people think I'm something I'm not; I've even given it a shot because, ""hey, if everyone else thinks I'm gay maybe I am and just don't know it."" Turns out I'm just comfortable with my sexuality and don't have any toxic masculinity / straight insecurities. My gay friends who know I'm straight just accept that sometimes it's okay to share a bed, or hold hands, or just do ""super gay shit"" like flash dancing or practicing the waltz or two step (not in public, otherwise I'd understand my problem).

&amp;#x200B;

I know how this all sounds, and I know there's more possibilities than gay/straight, but in my heart of hearts I know I'm straight. When I have a crush on a girl, I'm nervous, I can't speak clearly, I'm scared, excited and vulnerable. When I first kiss the girl I like, my heart flutters and I can't sleep I'm so excited. But when I've kissed boys (yes, there's a sample size because I needed to be sure) I didn't feel any of that. Great kissers and awful ones I still felt, ""...oh."" When girls get handsy it's like fireworks and I get warm all over; when fellas get handsy it's like getting a physical.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I'm getting at other than ""hey people who've never met me, how do I be more straight."" But if anyone has any advice, please let me know."
"I think I may have dated someone who has TWO girlfriends


so I went on a date with this guy, liked him a lot. We hooked up kept chatting really well and today I found out (not from him) that he has two girlfriends. I knew he was attracted to both men and women, but he never mentioned this to me. I am not sure how to proceed or what to do? Should I ask him? I am kind of a bit shocked, I mean I dont mind he sees other people, but him not mentioning even though we talked a lot isnt it a red flag? nice way to start my dating life haha"
"Hitting on people


I‚Äôm a straight dude but I just wondered do you guys often hit on straight dudes and find that out later or can you often tell if someone‚Äôs gay?"
"Would you randomly strike up a conversation wtih a guy you saw in public?


Personally it's not my style, but there are lots of people who have no problems just chatting it with a total stranger. 

Do you do this?"

"I need help finding a gay porn video where one of the guys plays Clair De Lune on an out of tune piano at the start!?


So I was chatting with a mate, and we ended up getting onto the topic of gay porn. And I remembered a video I watched a while back of a cute teen couple bangin‚Äô in the morning and at the start there was a cute bit of piano. 
Both being muso nerds I thought it would be cool if I found it for her to show her the wonderful world of gay porn"
"What is Grindr like for minorities?


I am curious what the Grindr experience is like for minorities. In my area in London, I see many many profiles restricting certain minorities from messaging them - generally its Asian / Black / South Asian ...

I talked to my Chinese friend who does not have a profile picture and he says that he frequently gets blocked when he sends his face and he gets told that he is not that person's type (even though he is quite muscular and attractive if I may say so). So there seems to be an implicit sense of unattractiveness associated with certain ethnicities in the gay community. 

Does this impact your self-esteem? Do you feel upset that you get fewer messages than say a White cis-gender average guy? Is there any solution or will Grindr remain a depressing superficial hookup app as it right now seems to be?"
"Can use some top advice


I'm in my late 20s and when I'm with a guy I extremely like the foreplay, cuddling, kissing and other soft things. So far in my life I've never really topped a guy because I wasn't anally oriented, I really like all the other things and it turns me on to see the other person enjoys it.

Recently this started to change, I'm interesting in topping someone more and I've been with a couple of guys to do this but It's not going so smooth.

For some reason when I put the condom on, lube is in place and I'm ready to enter I can see that the guy is slightly uncomfortable because it slightly huts in the beginning, seeing this (the slight pain) for some reason turns me off and I get soft really quick and It's extremely difficult to get hard again. As I don't have much top experience (the guys I do this with are aware and happy to explore this more with me) I'm not very confident. To be clear, I really want to get better and the thought of fucking someone turns me on a lot.

Do you guys have any tips how I can improve myself or some guidelines. I'm thinking to start with a cockring to stay hard. Thanks!"
"Why are the good ones always straight?


So I‚Äôm pretty drunk and frustrated, so I thought I would make this post tonight. 

Every time I have ever had a crush on a guy, they are straight. I don‚Äôt like people because they are straight, I just like attractive and interesting men. And at 20 years old, having come out of the closet when I was 16, I‚Äôm still a total virgin. I haven‚Äôt even kissed another guy, let alone anything else. 

I‚Äôm from a small rural town, so I‚Äôm not surprised nor that upset that I didn‚Äôt get to have a relationship in high school. But now in my sophomore year of college, every time I show interest in a guy, they turn out to be straight. And it‚Äôs so frustrating. 

The worst part is my principles- I know I could download Grindr and lose my virginity if I really wanted to, but what I‚Äôm really looking for is a relationship. I‚Äôve tried Tinder, with no luck, and I just can‚Äôt seem to find a man. 

Tonight I was at a party, and we put on ironic name tags. The guy I have a crush on put ‚ÄúAlex Jones, But Gay.‚Äù I thought it was a sign that things had finally worked out for me- but alas, no such luck, as a short conversation revealed he had a girlfriend. Like always, he was straight. I left the party crushed. 

I just don‚Äôt understand my luck. I don‚Äôt understand how this keeps happening to me, every time I even have a small crush. Relationships feel like this magical, fantastical thing, but not something that really happens to people. It certainly doesn‚Äôt happen to me. I‚Äôve just kind of started to resign myself to the fact that I‚Äôm going to be alone in my life. 

TLDR: All men I‚Äôve liked have been straight. Thought one at a party was sending me signals, but he was straight like all the others and I‚Äôm an idiot. "
"Is it hanging out or is there more to it?


Met this guy on Grindr (ik not the best place) and we hit it right off the bat, he seems like a really good decent guy who I guess recently got out of a bad relationship. Asked him if he was looking to hang out and grab some food, I also asked if he would want to chill after he agreed. Now I asked him if he wanted to hook up but he doesn‚Äôt hang like that so I said ok. But after we texted and agreed to hang out he ask if I had wanted to do something more sexual which I said yea but I think making out will do for now, I‚Äôm just afraid that we might go over board and have sex the first time we meet however he did say he wasn‚Äôt into younger guys so Idk what to think now. And I really think he‚Äôs cute and an overall gentleman, but I think communication is very vague when he replies. What should I do?"
