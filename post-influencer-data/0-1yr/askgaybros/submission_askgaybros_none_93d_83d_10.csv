3 years ago today, 49 of our brothers were massacred at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. Take a minute today to remember them and hug your bros/friends and let them know you love them. We are all people with hopes and dreams and these were taken too soon üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà."
"Tea with grandma (or how to suck and fuck like a porn star)


36M

I have been with my partner for almost 16 years.

I've had lots of gay sex and wanted to pass on some advice. Sadly, most of this stuff wasn't available to me as a young person so I had to figure it out along the way. Here is to helping those who come after us.

&amp;#x200B;

1st

Your butt needs lube. Lots and lots and lots. Start off with too much and dial it back. Not the other way around. DO NOT CONSERVE LUBE. Get that hole as wet as possible. This is going to relieve so many problems from the start. Get a lube injector and shoot a nice amount up into that hole. So many men think they can't bottom because they don't use enough lube to get comfortable and fully release those muscles. They stretch. They stretch a LOT. Butt you need to start with excess and then dial it back. If you are particularly tight you should start using a butt plug 30-60 minutes before any anal play. Again, lube that. I use crisco on my glass butt plug as it stays slippery and doesn't evaporate.

2nd

J-lube is the cheapest &amp; best option. Skip that overpriced silicone bullshit. J-Lube is compatible with everything and is the prefered lube for fisting. So it can take any size dick. It is a small hassle to make but then you save it in a water bottle and keep it for a week or two. Pour some into a cup and use the injector with the cup. The j-lube is made with a lot of sugars so you don't want to stick dick/fingers/injector or any other non-sanitary things inside the storage bottle. it can grow bacteria after a while. That's why you need to pour it into a cup.

3rd

Buy a clean stream shower enema system. They are cheap on amazon and screw into your shower. It makes cleaning yourself the fastest event possible. If you don't live alone buy an enema bulb from amazon or your local drug store. If you are a teenager and can't do either, use a water bottle. Hold the mouth up to your anus but don't stick it inside. Just squeeze the water up there and bam: Clean boy pussy. Viola! (Eat lots and lots of fiber every day so you are always ready. Salad is the best imh but you need to learn your own body. Lots of people need fiber pills.)

4th

Use Biotene mouthwash. I started using it because of dry mouth from marijuana. But it is the #1 addition for marathon blow jobs. Also, if you have a gag reflex their is numbing mouth spray. You won't need it forever. But it helps you train your throat. No gag reflex is something you can learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, gay sex is beautiful and wonderful and our stupid civilization doesn't allow enough safe spaces for us to talk about it so thank you to everyone on the internet for helping out the next generation. Let's keep normalizing this stuff. Some day young people will grow up with no shame. And no one will have to come out. The world is changing.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and FUCK TRUMP. Preferably with a bat filled with nails."
"Found my kink right after he said; ""it's my turn now.""


I hooked up with a gay that I could simply describe as one of the sexiest guys I have seen in my life. Confident, tall, beard, brown hair, fucking hilarious body (he is a rock climber) hairy in all the right places. Bigger and taller than me. And his dick was a ten too. 

He fucked me twice in the span of two hours, we were talking in bed (and he's an interesting person with stories) I was thinking we were done but he grabs my dick, gives it a few strokes, looks me in the eyes and says: it's my turn now! He turns on his stomach, slaps his ass and points at it saying; right here. 

I go from confusion to shock to hell fucking yes. I mean this guy that looks like a god, just owned my ass twice, was up there with one of the best I've had in my time since I've been bottoming, is waiting for me. I was thinking there's no chance he also bottoms or would want me to fuck him after we did it twice. It was a surprise and I've never been so turned on. He wasn't shy either, he wanted it, enjoyed it. I usually don't care, most guys are versatile to some point but this definitely blew me."
"I can‚Äôt believe guys like this exist.


I was at a bar with a friend last night. I overheard a couple of guys talking about dating. One of them said ‚Äúyeah, he‚Äôs cute and we get along and all, but he has less than a thousand followers on Instagram so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna go for him.‚Äù

The other guy said ‚Äúoh yeah, that‚Äôs way too low!‚Äù Like...*he actually encouraged his friend to reject someone over their follow count on Instagram.*

What the fuck is this world coming to where social media presence is an important part of dating someone?! What the fuck is wrong with people?!

It blows my mind."
"How can I tell my son that I know he is homosexual and that there is no problem?


Excuse me, English is not my mother tongue. Google sent me to this place, I hope I'm doing well.

My son has always been different. He does not like people, he does not like to play, he does not like to go out, he does not like to socialize, etc. He does not have friends, he likes reading and video games, and it is very rare that he wants to leave home.

About a year ago, he met a Jos√©, and his behavior changed in many ways. He went to Jos√©'s house, he went to the movies with Jos√©, Jos√© spent a lot of time in our house, and my son talked a lot about Jos√©. Jos√© this and Jos√© this other. I thought, it's good that my son finally has a friend.

But recently, my son changed his attitude again. He seemed always angry and rude. I realized that Jos√© did not appear in the house anymore, and my son did not talk about him anymore.

I asked him out of curiosity, and where is Jos√©? And my son told me, I'm angry with him. And I asked him, why? And my son told me, because Jos√© now has a girlfriend and he does not let go of her. Jos√© does not want to be with me anymore. And my son held back the tears.

It was there when I realized, I was seeing the situation in the wrong way. My son has a crush on Jos√©.

I do not care if he likes a person of the same sex. What surprises me is that he does not trust me to tell me.

As I said at the beginning, Google sent me here. I hope I'm doing things right.

What can I do or should I do?

Thanks in advance."
"Being hairy and gay...


Hello everyone, I just wanted to get this off my chest: I‚Äôm a hairy vers guy and some of my tops don‚Äôt like my hair, they tell me to shave or wax, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to, it‚Äôs who I am, as cringy as it may sound, it‚Äôs a part of me and I don‚Äôt want to be ashamed of my body hair. 

Now if you‚Äôre not attracted to guys with body hair, that‚Äôs okay, but it doesn‚Äôt give you the right to insult me or be disrespectful to me in any other way."
"Does anyone else suddenly cry late at night from loneliness and just want to be loved right in that second?


But not going to happen anytime soon, frustrated with all your problems trying to sort them out, knowing you will be alone for awhile."
"After 8 years, I marry my best friend in 10 days.


Growing up in an extremely religious household, getting excommunicated from the church, disowned by my grand parents, and living in a world where the topic of gay marriage was either taboo or something you would only dream about; I'm finally getting married to the love of my life in 10 days.

Never thought this day would come. Never thought it would be legal. Never thought I'd get to have that special day with someone that I love.

We're flying across the country to Las Vegas for a private ceremony (no, it's not themed lol), and spending 9 beautiful days out there to celebrate. Throwing a big reception at our home in the fall!

We fought, we died, we hurt, all in the name for equality. What a fantastic day that I can marry my best friend."
"Straight farther giving ""dad hugs"" at Pride broke me and made me cry.


Idk where to post this but I need to vent. 

I saw screenshots on social media about the free dad hugs and mom hugs at pride. I would get a little teary eyed for half a second but just scrolling and look at memes. Then I saw there was a YouTube clip with the dad hug guy and I saved it to watch later. https://youtu.be/SepsuAXPCQ8

I got around to watching it, and even then just listening to the CNN host and the guy talk because I was driving. I couldn't even get through the 6- minute video with out bursting into tears in the middle of the road. I spent like 10 minutes crying in the mall balling my eyes out. I just felt so alone, sad, angry and hated. The thought of those dad hugs from someone so open and loving but knowing I'll never have that tore me apart. It hurt so much especially having just given my dad his father's day gift. Im not out because my parents are homophobic. 

I knew it might make me cry ever since I saw it on Twitter but I didn't think it would hurt that much. It's been a while since I cried like that tbh. Now I'm oscillating between being sad and crying and being mad for being sad and crying. I just wanted to let it out."
"My boyfriend just left me for someone else


This was my first boyfriend and I'm 25 I just came out of the closet, he said he wanted to take a break, but you know what that means. He said we met someone else who asked him out. I didn't really hear him out because I felt so crushed, I put so much into this, I tried so hard to stay with him and he just left me for some guy who asked him out. I don't even know what to do, it hurts. I'm trying to hold back my tears in a bathroom stall on my lunch break."
"Do guys like being carried (literally) to bed?


So a guy invited me over a few nights ago, we start hooking up on his couch and taking each others clothes off. I suggest we go to his room and fuck, he‚Äôs down so we both get up off the couch. He‚Äôd been touching my chest and saying stuff like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so strong‚Äù etc, it REALLY turned me on, so I just picked him and carried him over my shoulder to the bedroom as we stand up. Idk why exactly, it just came over me and he‚Äôs a 5‚Äô7‚Äù twink that told me he wanted to be dominated, I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô top so I guess it felt appropriate lol. We proceed to consummate the Grindr chat, and afterward he tells me over text that he wants me to come by again this weekend. 

It felt pretty powerful in the moment to literally toss a guy around (before and after the bedroom hah) but idk how to play that going forward in other hookups. Like is that a kink I should say I‚Äôm into? Or just kind of play it by ear?"
"At 430 AM TODAY (CST) My best friend (of 14 years) came out the closet to me, and 2 other of our best friends. Things got bad QUICKLY, then good, now its silence. Help


My best friend this morning came out of the closet to 3 of us this morning, and we're all best friends... well we were....

Backstory: We all planned a trip to Miami as we go somewhere every year since all of us got out of the military (7 years straight now) and Miami comes upon us in a few months.

PRESENTLY:

Today, my best friend (who also works with me as do the other 2) offered to take us out to breakfast before our shift begins. 

We arrive, we sit, we order, we shoot the shit about work and such and we notice that he starts tearing up and gets silent. 

Before we can even ask what's wrong, he comes out and says it... ""I'm gay"".

Just like that folks.

Now there's 2 sets of reactions. 

The 2 other best friends... they get in cahoots in the middle of this restaurant with their damnation of his personal life, and cancel their part of the Miami trip coming up, pay their share of the bill, and storm out.

(Now my gay best friend is crying severely at the table, just us 2) 

***it is now 4:35 AM*** (no significance.. ZERO)

And then there's my reaction, mouth FULL of bacon and eggs, and I finally gather myself after swallowing, and reach my hand and putit on his shoulder across the table (I'm 6'7"", I have a reach) and tell him that his love life is his love life, not mine or anyone else's so no problem from me and I support him.

(I am fucking horrible at comforting friends, but it was on the fly)

And he's still crying his eyes out, but gathered himself a little later and asked me if I hated him too.

I told him, (in a nutshell) after how he was there for me during my hardest times** (explained below at end) I would never leave over one of his, and that i would never want to pass hatred and condemnation onto a good friend like him, discrimination gets us nowhere, and I wont hate you over your personal preference and I support him

So he smiles a little, wipes final tears, and asks how we go about cancelling our trip to Miami... and I kinda felt at odds with how he felt and how they (the other 2 FORMER best friends) treated the situation. 

I pretty much told him.... Miami doesn't stop for 2 people, and that we are continuing on our mission to the beach and stuff, and that's if hes not too bummed out to go from the situation. Either way I'm fine.

And he was surprised, because he stated that he thought I would follow behind the other 2, but I told him that best friends dont have conditions upon the love life of the other friend (if that makes sense.)

I hate that it all hit him at once, but I'm happy he's got that initial weight off his shoulders im sure he will prosper from this moment forward.

So the finale is, we're going to south beach, and this time, its gonna be everything HE wants to do instead of what everyone decides as a collective. He was happy at the end of this 45 minute rollercoaster of a breakfast session, but now hes just.... distant.

**Small backstory explaining how good of a brother he is to me** &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(I was married, my wife got shot and killed, and it was obviously the hardest time of my life, and he was there for 6 months, and took emergency leave to be there for the court process of the assailant and all the ups and downs)

So ultimately my questions are, after this morning, how do I be there for him, as he were for me? I've texted him and he replies in short, vague messages. Do I need to check on him more frequently? I know this has got to be rough, but I have no fucking idea what I'm doing. 

But I am trying.

 I offered dinner and beer whenever hes free and he declined and wasnt in the mood to talk. I'm sure his emotions will be up and down. And I'll be patient for as long as he needs me to be.

I'm really just trying to be a good friend and dont want to overstep his boundaries, especially after 2 of our best friends left his life so quickly. (I cut them off for their comments made as well) just trying to be supportive and I dont want him feeling like I'm abandoning him.

TL;DR: Friend came out to 3 other friends, 2 cut him off, I stayed, we're going to south beach without them, gonna hit every kinda gay bar/Gathering/pow wow he wants so he (WE) can enjoy Miami. But between now and then, how can I be there for him and he's super distant atm?

I missed some parts but I'm tired as hell and hopefully this all made sense.

Thanks for reading and hopefully you gentlemen have suggestions! Because idk what the HELL I'm doing :/"
"My ""straight"" best friend's wife wrote me, asking me to stop having sex with her husband.


I've been having sex with my best friend for about 12 years. He's been married the entire time. It started when he would complain about his wife's lack of interest in sex. He loves blow jobs and she won't even consider sucking his cock. As any good , gay friend would do, I offered to step in. Selfishly of course. My friend is attractive, fit and we've been workout buddies for as long as we've been friends. Our bodies were not mysteries to one another, but we've never connected sexually,.... until I made him a proposition. Fast forward 12 years and we still see one another for sex about 3 times a month. It was very tame at 1st, then developed into full blown, penetrative sex on both sides. My friend has always been paranoid about his wife finding out, but I would have to be the one to tell her. He would never, and I would never. He insists he's very discreet and she would never find out.  One week ago, I received a letter from his wife asking me to stop having sex with her husband. It was short and to the point.   She says she's suspected for years, but had convinced herself her husband is totally straight. She's beaten him up over his porn collection, which is all straight porn and made him feel guilty for jerking off, even though she provides no sexual outlet for him. My being gay was never revealed to her by him or by me and I assumed she just thought I was straight. I have a son from an earlier relationship so that in itself provided some measure of deception.  Apparently she got into his phone and my friend had not deleted several sexually oriented text messages my friend and I had exchanged about meeting up. She says she won't confront her husband and doesn't want a divorce, she just wants the sex to stop. I know that she hasn't had sex with her husband for almost 4 years. I've had more sex with her husband than she has throughout their entire married life .   I enjoy the sex I have with my friend. Early on it was just about getting each other off. Now its passionate, spend the night, make you breakfast after, kind of sex. My friend has often told me i'm the only man he's ever had sex with. I want to believe its true, but I wouldn't be surprised if It wasn't. I'm certainly not exclusive to him. My friend has no idea she knows, has no idea she's written to me and I can't imagine telling him. I'm in a pickle.. don't know what to do. I can't see any solution that doesn't completely suck. The final sentence.. 'So, yes. I know you are having sex with my husband. Please stop."
"Mom read my journal and now knows I‚Äôm gay


I was going to tell my parents eventually. I moved back home after college for just a short time because 1) saving money and 2) just started a new job in the area so I thought it would be a good idea. Get a call from my sister today that my mother called her apparently upset after she decided to go through my journal, where I just write things. To get a better picture, my parents are your typical white, southern baptist people in Tennessee. 

I‚Äôm somewhat relieved it happened this way but incredibly hurt/pissed she decided to go through my things. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôm moving out ASAP."
"I just told my wife I thought we should split up! She was surprisingly OK with it!


I don't have anybody to tell irl just yet.

I feel so much relief it's indescribable! 

It was so really hard to be someone I'm not and not have the right feelings I was supposed to have, I started feeling sick all the time and crying in the car on the way home like a total bitch.

I'm only sad because I guess I'll die alone with no kids but whatever, worth it just to be myself. I feel like an awful stereotype and a failure in life. But I can live with that.

Also most importantly she said it was ok and she didn't cry or anything. We had been together 4 years. She is at her sisters. I just said I wasn't happy and we had got distant I did say I was bisexual but not the reason."
"Yay marrying tomorrow


On the way to Danish Island after 10 hours almost arrived. Tomorrow we marryyyyy and then 10 hours back lolz"
"Update: Dating an introvert who hasn‚Äôt been in a real relationship before.


Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/c1q2n1/dating_an_introvert_with_hasnt_been_in_a_real/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=control_2

A few of you asked me to keep you updated on what was going on. tl;dr-I started dating an introverted guy who‚Äôd never had a serious boyfriend. Everything was off to an amazing start, he texting me and I him, making plans, even talking about long term dating. 

Well he ghosted me. 

Last time we talked was Monday. I was going on vacation this week and he said we could hang out when I‚Äôm back so we‚Äôd have a lot to talk about. We exchanged a few small words about how our day was going and then that was it. I shot him a text Tuesday and nothing. I waited a few days and shot him a text of me on vacation, which he‚Äôd asked me to do. Nothing. It‚Äôs been almost five days. 

I was worried about this. He was so energetic about us at first that I worried he‚Äôd burn out on us and I think that‚Äôs what happened. I think he fell in love with the idea of us and when it sank in that it could get serious he freaked out a little and ran. On a larger level I think he‚Äôs a little afraid of commitment. He‚Äôs never had a bf before.

But here‚Äôs the thing that I took away: here I am blaming myself. What did I do wrong? I look back on the last week that we‚Äôve been talking and I don‚Äôt see how I did anything bad, pushy, clingy, etc. So why should I stress myself out? He told me to text him when I was on vacation. He said we‚Äôd get together this weekend. So why am I trying to figure out what I did wrong when he‚Äôs the one not meeting me half way anymore?

Much of my dating life I would look back and ask what I did wrong. Did I text too much? Did I come off as clingy? All questions that stressed me out. But this time though I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong. I met his enthusiasm half way every time and tried to keep myself in check, and for the most part I did. So for that I‚Äôm proud.

My friends say he got too freaked out by how much he liked me and it scares him. Personally I think he had his fun and just decided to move on. Either way, I can‚Äôt blame myself. The only thing that hurts me a lot is that I felt a stronger connection to him than I had with any other guy in many years. I thought he could have been something amazing. I felt so relaxed and happy when I was with him. 

I‚Äôm not going to text him anymore or block him or anything. Given that he‚Äôs introverted, he just might need more time. So I‚Äôll give him that but I‚Äôm moving on.

Thanks guys :-)"
"Being thirsty for cuddles? Can anyone relate?


Lately, I really want to just make out and cuddle whenever I see a nice, cute guy. Sometimes I feel like I need to hold myself back when I want to touch them, which would be inappropriate, since it's just boys I see on the streets in public or they're friends or acquaintances. Am I weird? Is it a kind of being horny? I don't get boners though, if that means anything. Am I too desperate? 


I don't know if I'd like to be in a relationship. I don't feel ready for that. I don't like hook-ups that much though. ~~Cuddle hook-ups should be a thing, really.~~


(I'm 20 if that matters. Feelings are weird, help.)"
