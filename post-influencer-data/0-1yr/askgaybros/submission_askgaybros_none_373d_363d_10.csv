"The Time A Cop Gave Me A Heartfelt Pep Talk About Being Gay


When I was sixteen years old (in— *God help me*— 1973), you can get from vending machines your fill of throwaway newspapers that featured pretty hot porn film ads in their back pages— ads to which I would incessantly and unremittingly jack off to.  But I needed more.  Having just gotten my driver’s license, I drove to Selma Avenue in Hollywood, which (as depicted in John Rechy’s *City of Night*) still abounded with male hustlers, a few sauntering down the street in their cowboy boots and tight Levis.  I wanted to approach one so badly, but I didn’t have the nerve and wasn’t sure I had enough money.  So I settled for entering a porn shop.  

To my disappointment the place was completely empty save for a few old guys looking at straight porn.  I found the gay section and grabbed a porn magazine.  Nervous as shit, I decided to buy the porn and get the fuck out.  The guy in the front desk didn’t bat an eye (I worried he would ask me for ID) and off I went with my first gay porn magazine.  

I put the magazine on the driver’s seat and drove off, so rattled that I failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign a few blocks down.  Sure enough, red lights immediately flared.  Without thinking, I pushed the magazine onto the floor between the driver’s seat and the right door of my car.  Wrong move.

Two twenty-something LAPD cops tell me to get out of the car.  Both were white, macho, no doubt straight, perhaps Vietnam vets, and quite typical of LAPD cops at that time. 

“You’re hiding something.  We have to check,” one of them tells me.

“It’s nothing.  Please don’t look.”

“We have to check.”

“It’s nothing.  *Please* don’t look.”

One of them lines me up against a wall while the second goes through my car.  I was so humiliated that I started crying.

The cop checking the car pulls out the porn magazine.  I cry harder.

The cop standing by me then tells me that I have nothing to cry about.  He tells me that they don’t give a shit that I’m gay, that it’s the last thing they care about.  He tells me that people have better things to worry about than who I sleep with.  Before I can even catch my breath, I realize that this cop is literally taking the time to reassure me and make me feel better.  He could have just snickered and driven off, but he didn’t.  He spent like five minutes giving me a literal pep talk about being gay. 

And he felt so bad for me that he didn't even give me a ticket.

How cool is that?

"Writing this letter to say goodbye to my family


Hey Fellas👋🏻

Make a long story short, there has been continual drama with my family since I’ve come out 7 years ago. To put it bluntly, I’m fucking exhausted and have had enough of the manipulation and being treated so poorly. For my own mental health and happiness, along with my boyfriends, this is the letter I’ve drafted to my parents to say goodbye. I would really love to hear what you guys think? Thank you❤️

—

Dear Mom and Dad,

 It is with a heavy heart I write this letter today. I need to be very honest and blunt with what I’m feeling. I love you both and always will. With that said, I refuse to be treated as a second class child any longer due to the fact that I’m gay. I have given you and other family members many years to work through me being gay and not turning out how you hoped I would. I’ve been extremely patient with all of the continuous comments and subtle ways you guys try and change my mind and not respect who I am as a person or Ian, who I love very much. I’ve been very clear where my boundaries are and you continue to ignore them. Not to mention, when I got diagnosed with arthritis, and going through one of the most painful experiences of my life, you guys said in a round about way that I got my arthritis because god was trying to get through to me. That was extremely offensive, hurtful, and mean. It’s also very hurtful that on my birthday every year, comments are made that remind me that I’m not who you guys want as a son. I know you say you love me, but you don’t really love who I am. You say one thing and your actions speak otherwise. You love the idea of who you wanted me to be. One’s real, the other is a fake identity that you’re still holding on to. The fact myself and Ian are not invited to family functions including most recently Mom’s birthday hurts deeply. Nobody has the balls to stand up to other family members for being bigots and bullying who can and can’t be at a family event. I know who they are. I’m a good person and the fact Ian and I are not allowed at something because people don’t like I’m gay and we love each other hurts greatly. That’s not a family I want to be apart of. That’s a family I’m ashamed of. Family is not always blood. You get to choose your family. Not to mention, you guys will come over to Spokane and very rarely make an effort to see Ian and I. I either find out about it after you left town or you say it’s a short trip and don’t have time, which isn’t true. It’s just other people aren’t comfortable being around me, and you guys don’t say anything or stand up for me. Ive also mentioned about coming to see you guys in Montana and all you say is “oh”. Not “That would be great!” It’s a tone of being uncomfortable and not wanting us to come over. Ian and I will not go where we’re not welcome. I’ve come to the sad realization that you guys and many other members of the family will never accept who I really am and I’m always going to be treated this way. I’ve finally accepted it. I can’t change any of your guys’ mind to make you accept and love me for who I am. If you can only love the illusion of who you want me to be, then I’m not really in your lives anyway. Ian, and his folks, Tony and Carol and our friends are my new family. They love me for me, and don’t treat me less because I’m gay. Like I said, I love you guys and always will. I wish you well and hope life treats you kindly. But this is where I truly let go of the hopes of being accepted into a family that I was never meant to be in. For my own mental health and my own happiness, this is where we must part ways and I move on with my life. Love you always❤️

"Walked out on a hookup - did I overreact?


Just walked out on a bi guy in his mid 20’s.

He refused to have sex with the lights on and then when he was about to enter/fuck me he just rammed it in like holy shit I was in so much pain for those few seconds it actually made me stand up.

Then I realised wtf am I still here and told him nah dude look I’m done here. He said in a low voice I think you’re overreacting but I was having none of it.

What do you guys think?"
"Are you planning on voting? Why the fuck not?


Our rights are literally on the line this time around. This isn’t a joke. If you’re not voting this year, you’re signing your own death warrant. FUCKING VOTE! IT’S YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE. LITERALLY."
"The tide is turning for me


So this isn’t really a question. More of a declarative statement. But I just went on a date. For the first time in three years I interacted with another guy in this way. I have struggled with anxiety problems ever since I left high school. At one point I would vomit when trying to talk to people. But I asked this guy out I really like and he said yes! It was fun we went and saw a movie. I am proud of myself. "
"Surviving The Plague


Today I’d like to express a little gratitude that I can stand before you and gripe about how fucked up everything is and complain about all that is imperfect in my life. Today I’d like to remember all the fallen heroes that I’ve known who would have given *everything* to be in my place today— dissatisfied though I perpetually am with my life. In my twenties there was nothing that I feared more than the prospect of growing old and invisible in the gay world, but now I quite ironically feel only *gratitude* for making it this far.

I was 25 living in San Francisco in 1982 when I heard the first whispers about an impending plague (initially described as “gay cancer”). Little did we know that so many of us had already been infected. I forget the exact percentages, but it was something like 30-40% of gay men in urban areas like New York, LA and San Francisco. In 1982 fear gripped the entire community. I remember that the bathhouses emptied that year. People were scared to have sex with one another. Soon enough, you’d hear gallows humor about how *we had all become our grandparents*. Our friends, lovers, and acquaintances were all dying, and no one can have sex anymore! I remember thinking that very thought to myself when my elderly parents began complaining ten years ago about how hard it is for them to watch all their friends die one after the other— forgetting that they were talking to someone who experienced that in his twenties and thirties. The AIDS generation of gay men became a new brand of *Holocaust survivors*— with all the guilt and mixed emotions that that entails. In 1982 I had two roommates: both died of AIDS. I had two best friends: both got AIDS; one died; the second killed himself when he was diagnosed with a particularly gruesome AIDS-related condition. I had a boyfriend that year: he got his AIDS diagnosis in the late 1980s, and, as far as I know, lived to see the cocktail come out and thus survived. I went to a weekly support group of twenty-something gay men: half the guys didn’t make it out alive. It is still difficult for me to visit San Francisco today because it feels like a graveyard.

I myself was diagnosed HIV+ in October 1985 (only a few months after the first HIV test became available) and took comfort in the assurances made by doctors at that time that only 10% of people with the virus would progress to full-blown AIDS. Then the number was raised to 25%, then 35%, then 50%, then 75%; finally by 1989 (or was it sooner?) it was declared that every last person who is HIV+ would eventually get AIDS. With my diagnosis began the regular doctor visits and the recurrent T-cell tests. T-cell counts became the new metric by which we judged one another and weighed each other’s standing. A drop of fifty or so points was met with panic and an immediate retest (is *this* it? is *this* the beginning of the end?)— even though few of us had any idea just how little our doctors knew about the immune system or understood what drops of our counts actually meant. (Fifteen years later I would learn that simply *flying in an airplane* would cause your T-cell count to drop by half.) My doctor was a gay man in his mid-thirties who himself succumbed to the virus and was dead by the mid-1990s. I never knew that he was HIV+ until he fell ill, but I saw the look of frustration on his face when he would inform me that my counts continued to be high or had gone back up after a temporary drop—frustration (I now guiltily understand) because *his* counts were not going back up as well. As friends and lovers sickened and died, I remained mysteriously healthy. Today I know that I am one of the just 3% of HIV+ people who are slow-progressors (it took me twenty-five years to progress to AIDS, while most people did so in only seven). I was among only a few of the initially infected who were able to beat out the clock and still be standing when the life-saving cocktail came out in 1996.

After my HIV diagnosis, I regularly went to the myriad of support groups that popped up in Los Angeles (where I was then living). People talked about how the crisis created a unique environment in which a lot of us gay men (normally aloof and full of attitude) became remarkably intimate and open with one another. It was a brief moment of *true community* that would fade once HIV/AIDS became a chronic condition. But it was hard not to be kind and open with one another as we began watching our friends and peers die, as we began our daily treks to the hospital wards, as we nursed our loved ones to the best of our abilities, and as we wondered when our turn would come. Another boyfriend of mine died of AIDS in December 1990. Javier had signed a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order when it was clear that the Kaposi sarcoma in his lungs had spread to such an extent that there was no use in living another day. We took him home to die, and sat by his bedside as his lungs slowly filled with fluid. We held his hands and watched him drown before our very eyes. That was almost thirty years ago, and yet I can't purge the image of his struggling futilely to take one more breath from my mind.

Javier had been disowned by his conservative Cuban father when he came out in his late teens and had never emotionally recovered from that rejection. One of my most haunting memories is seeing that father trying to make amends by nursing him night and day during the last weeks of his life, and tearfully asking for his forgiveness when he was taking his final breaths. Moments like that were pretty common for us gay men in those years.

Looking back, I can’t say that we would have done anything differently. We got infected not realizing what was out there. We were all completely in the dark. I think, all in all, we handled the catastrophe pretty damn well, given the paucity of support and the extent of our isolation in those years. And so many of us were so young and so emotionally ill-equipped to take on what had befallen us. But I think that the plague has left its toll on what remains of the AIDS generation. Many of us are broken survivors. And largely forgotten survivors at that."
"Real men do this


My whole life I've been assaulted by hetero normative toxic masculinity. Being gay makes it particularly challenging to connect with that set of ideals. I found an empowering bypass to these annoying criticisms that I, and I'm sure a lot of you gaybros, have heard (""real men do ______ "" or ""real men don't sing Lady Gaga at the top of lungs, etc etc.)



My friend looked at me the other day and said ""real men do what they want."" I almost cried hearing it because it was like an instant weight had been lifted off my shoulders. My masculinity is no longer tied to an archaic idea of what a man should be. I wanted to share this with you gaybros in the hope that it will help one of you the way it has helped me. Remember guys "" real men do what they want"" and don't let anyone tell you differently."
"Do you bro’s ever jack off to come to your senses?


Seeing attractive people through out your day and wishing you could have your SO and fuck many guys. Until you jack off and literally come to your senses that you don’t need any of that?

I sometimes wish I had a bf to blow or fuck, but after I jack off I remember who I am. Does anyone else have this “issue”? "
"UPDATE: Writing this letter to say goodbye to my family.


Hey fellas👋🏻

I first of all want to say that I was so taken back by the outpouring of love and support from all of you! It legit brought me to tears. So thank you❤️

Below is the final edit of my letter to my parents. Make a long story short I met with them this last Sunday before they left town and read it to them in person. I felt it was the right thing to do. They need to realize what they’re throwing away due to their beliefs. 

After I read the letter my dad got super quiet, and my mom cried a lot as did I. My mom said that just like I don’t mean to inflict pain on them they don’t mean to inflict pain on me. It’s that they choose to believe what they believe and I choose to be gay. Told her that’s where they’re wrong. It’s not a choice.  My dad said that even though I’m parting ways with them that they’ll never stop loving me or praying for me. Gave my mom a kiss and hugs to both of them. Before I left, I said that hopefully they’ll realize that it’s not a choice and that one day they’ll love me for who I really am. Turned around and walked away.

I’ve been super emotional the past few days, but also feel a weight lifted because I won’t have to deal with all of the passive aggressive manipulation. It’s just the sadness of letting go of what could have been. I’m just so thankful for my boyfriend, his parents, and all of our wonderful friends and all of you❤️ Time for the next chapter.


Here’s the letter:


Dear Mom and Dad,

If at any point you choose to have Ian and I apart of your lives and can fully accept who I am as a person and us as a couple, then we can work toward a relationship again. Until then, this is goodbye.

Love you always❤️

"Husband was diagnosed lung cancer


He’s just 30 but has a genetic predisposition. Last Tuesday he told me he’s been receiving treatment for almost a month.
I think I still haven’t processed the news. He doesn’t wanna talk about it and doesn’t want me to tell anyone. It makes him anxious and that’s the last thing he needs right now. 

Just needed to get it out somehow."
"“Boy Pussy”


The other day I was at this rich older guys house. We were hooking up and he starts eating my ass. He states, “yeah spread that hot BOY PUSSY”. I went limp and felt really uneasy. Eventually just wrapped it up from there. Anyone else feel that term should be removed from society completely? "
"Has anyone else turned someone off because of cigarette use?


I just find the ashy taste and smell disgusting "
"Any black gaybros here? Anyone out? Feeling very isolated and basically staring at the open closet door but not walking through it.


Hey all. I'm a late twenties black dude who is seriously dealing with a tug of war to come out and also general issues in my own community.

I'm out to all of my friends, but still feel awkward talking about gay things with them. To this day. And it's been nearly 8 years since came out. They're all straight though...I don't have gay friends at all and it feels impossible to get any considering I've heard how ""unwelcoming"" the gay community can seem. I don't really see black guys in any of the meetup pics on here or anything.

My family doesn't know. But I'm 27 and have never brought a girl home, never had a girlfriend, and have never even mentioned women in any context since at least age 15. I'm not a feminine guy at all, so my family must think I'm straight despite this. 

I'm just sick of lying. It's even worse considering I live at home and despite having a decent job I can barely afford an apartment here. So I live in these two worlds where my friends know but I'm still uncomfortable and my family doesn't know. All I have is anonymous hookups that never go anywhere because I'm scared. Feels unfair to the guys who try and date me because I'm just afraid.

I feel like my youth is ticking away. How do you get the courage to just say 'fuck it'? I always thought eventually I'd just get fed up and own up to everything but that hasn't happened and I'm still closeted at this age. Any advice?"
