"What is the funniest joke youve made as a result of being gay?


I work in IT and we were moving offices and I was setting up a computer in a tight space so I couldn't see the back of the computer. I was having trouble getting the cable in one of the ports. My coworkers (all straight) start joking about me not being able to find the hole or get in in the hole. So I respond ""I'm a bottom, I don't need to find the hole.""

And that is how I came out to my coworker."
"Went on my first gay date... and yeah now I know I'm 100% gay


Hey all, so I am 23 and had recently been curious about what its like being with a guy. I dipped my foot in the water wity gay porn and was got pretty into it rather quickly. So I set up a tinder and gave it a shot. Matched with a guy, chatted a bit and decided to meet up for a bit and to walk around. 

He had no idea I had never even kissed a guy but I actually felt comfortable really quickly. As we were walking he asked if I'd go back to his place for bit to which I said yes. 

I knew something sexual was about to go down and honestly I was excited. We started kissing (which was really the same to me as kissing a girl). Something got into me which made me want to give him a bj. Its kind of funny because the second I started blowing him I became rock hard myself. For about 5 minutes I had the most sexual fun I had ever had. He liked it to (as I could tell when he finished). After this we parted ways for the night. 

It feels like a whole new world has been opened up!

"I came out to my dad


It went worse than expected. He started screaming at my mom for not telling him earlier and that if he knew he could have fixed me. I told him it's not a thing to be fixed and he was shocked. He then asked me if I am going to pursue this ""lifestyle"" and when I said it's not a lifestyle it's who I am and I will be who I am he told me to leave the house. My mom pleaded to him to think before he acts and said I am still their child that they love but my dad said ""no son of mine is a faggot"" and he told my mom she can leave too if she is going to support me ""in my ill ways"". What I was afraid of most happened. He threw my mom on the street. I begged her to come with me to my house but she is a proud woman and she refuses. She went to an old house we have but it's total trash there. I wanna take her home with me but she won't go. The house she went to is horrible. No one has lived there for over 40 years, there is no electricity or even water. I am crazy worried. My brother called me and he was angry at me because he says I shouldn't have come out to dad, that all I did now was ruin their marriage and sent mom off to that shithole. I feel so fuckin bad! "
"I finally did it!!


I literally just let the guy out of my house who took my anal virginity. I am a straight guy (well bi now I guess) and have been using a dildo for a long time and finally wanted to try the real thing. So I went on Grindr, decided tonight was the night. 20 minutes and the perfect guy messaged me. Really nice, we went for a drink and then went back to mine. We slightly scripted but not to much because it was my first time. It was going great and I said I wanted to ride him. OMG. 2 minutes and I just came. It was insane, his cock wasn’t to big but was nice enough. He even called me a ‘good lad’ when I came. Felt like giving myself a pat on the back. 

It’s about 15 minutes after now and my legs are so week. My ass is still feeling amazing and I feel very relieved I have done it. We swapped numbers and I’m just gonna stick with fucking him occasionally for now. The best part is, he is such a chill guy, we get on really well. 

But after 4 months of contemplating, shitty guys and no shows it’s happened and I feel so happy about it. 



But I overcame my nerve"
"Billie Eilish doesn’t deserve the shit she’s getting.


As a gay man, I firmly do not understand the backlash she is receiving for her new song “Wish you were gay”
The entire point of the song is that she would prefer that this boy doesn’t like her because she herself is a problem, and that it would be much easier to accept that his sexuality is different rather than whatever possible reason there might be for him being so distant from her. I simply can’t comprehend how she’s “fetishizing gay men”."
"Anyone else feel like being gay is more acceptable if you're attractive?


I swear, sometimes it feels like if you are young, attractive, toned/skinny, masculin/straight acting (and probably white). Every girl wants you to be their ""gay best friend"" and in the eyes of the boys, you're ""just another one of the Bros"". You'll be the face of the LGBT rights movement, and you and your boyfriend (assuming they're attractive as well) will make the front page of the news for some gay related article.

However, if you do not fit that description, you just ""couldn't get a girlfriend"", you're a sexual deviant, a pervert, a ""I don't care about gay people as long as they don't hit on me"", and heaven forbid you get a crush on someone who is straight, or go so far as compliment someone on the way they look or dress.

I can't say much about lesbians, as I'm not one, but I've heard way too many comments like ""there's no such thing as a hot lesbian"" or ""I told you they just do it for money"" in regards to lesbian couples that don't like like the top search results from pornhub."
"Would you date someone who looks like me?


This is a throwaway since I don't want some one from my family to think I am depressed again. I was a firefighter for 7 years until 3 years ago a building collapsed and I was hurt very bad. I saved many people that night but after it I ended up in my current state. I lost my leg and my body is severely scarred by burns and to tell you the truth I look like someone from a horror movie. To add to that I am blind with one eye, again due to the trauma. I wanted to be a firefighter to help people and I helped many but I also wanted to have a life some day, meet mister Right and settle down. 















I went on some therapy for PTSD but you know, what could some one possibly tell me when I see what I look like. Yesterday I went out to the park to catch some sunlight and a few kids made fun of me. Can you imagine that? Ran around me calling me a freak and laughing. Now I know they are kids and they don't know any better, they don't "
"Sex party: a quick update


A couple of days ago I (m,32) posted about going to my first sex party (don't know how else to call it), so I just wanted to share my experience with it...
It was actually really interesting, definitely less sleazy than I thought it was going to be. I was greeted by two very nice hosts, gave them a bottle of wine, complimented their lovely apartment and sat at the dinner table where two other very nice guys were in the middle of a bj sesh. One of the hosts was kind enough to free me out of my jeans and proceeded to give me a hell of a deepthroat (he's talented, I have to say) and I quickly became the popular kid in class since they noticed I was a bit on the thick side in the dick department. 
In the following hour I was very generously sucked off by all of the guys at the party (there were 9 of us in total, mostly guys in their mid 30s, early 40s), I tag teamed a very cute otter with one of the hosts, banged another lovely gentleman in the bathroom and gave a nice facial to one of the hosts (the beard made it ten times hotter). We drank gin, played cards, discussed some light politics as we lighted up - it was definitely a very enjoyable evening all together, just a bunch of dudes having a gay old time."
"Dude in the shower across from me was straight up jerking off


I went into the shower at the gym after my workout and as I'm soaping up, I turn around and this guy is literally jerking off while watching me. Weirdest experience I've ever had at the gym. He was so bold about it that I was kind of impressed, but it was too much for me so I took another stall. 

Also as I was showering I watched the same 3 dudes (including him) go between shower and sauna several times, is this normal? Or are they just using it as an opportunity to peak at dudes?"
"What is a non sexual act that turns you on?


I'll start. When he's parking on reverse and puts his arm behind my seat to look back"
"Does anyone consider themselves a ""side"" rather then a top or bottom?


This new term I recently learned in the gay community called a side.  It is a gay men who chooses not to participate in anal but just oral and other things.  I was actually kinda relieved when I heard about this cause the pressure have having anal is stressful for me.  Just wanted to know if anyone else would consider themselves a side"
"What makes people hate feminine gay guys? Why do people act aggressive towards them sometimes?


Hi fellas

A few minutes ago I was walking towards my metro station and there were construction workers chilling on one side and then they saw me walking. One of them became particularly aggressive verbally speaking and he started shouting at me in the most low class way possible and this situation has made me so uncomfortable.

I just started thinking and I just couldn’t figure it out what it is that makes people do this? I mean of course I have my own thoughts and I may judge people every now and then for looking a certain way and that’s alright but I’d never start making a scene and start shouting and acting in such an aggressive manner. Like hey there are so many of us and besides!!! I didn’t even look that feminine, I just don’t understand the aggressive behaviour at all. It just made me so upset.

I’m attaching a pic of my outfit just in case you were wondering what I looked like:

"Inverted Porn Dynamics


For some reason, I appreciate porn where the bigger/more muscular/alpha looking guy gets topped by someone smaller/more fem than them. There’s just something about daddies that  who crave that D. Who’s with me?"
"Embarrassed about starting accounting at 30


Didn't know what I wanted to do in my 20s. Was a security guard. Will be starting accounting next fall with kids in their teens. 

There are worse positions to be in but just sucks. It's an improvement in my life but just sucks how I'll be closer in age to many of the professors than many of my peers."
"My mom just messaged me one year after she kicked me out for me being gay and I'm not sure how to proceed.


Hello my friends. 
Several months ago I posted in this sub asking for advice on how to deal with an overbearing mother who cannot handle having a gay son. The post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9t3bsj/i_24_came_out_to_my_mom_and_she_kicked_me_out_im) if you want the background.
I did not give my family my new number so they now infrequently message me via email. Her message is as follows:

""Well I know you don't care but I just wanted to let you know that it has been a year since you sucker-punched the life out of me and our family. Since then I have seen two counselors. The first one was too immature to handle my issues. So I prayed about it and found the most wonderful Christian psychotherapist. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. My physical and mental health have taken such a toll but I am stronger because of it . .  My psychotherapist thinks that only by a miracle of God that I haven't suffered a complete nervous breakdown with all the traumas that I have suffered especially in this past two years [She lost her mom and our house caught fire about a year before that]. My relationship with God has grown even closer and my faith in him will never waiver.. just like I will never stop praying for you and I will never stop loving you. Your lack of compassion is mind-boggling to my psychotherapist. Especially given the field of work that you will go into.. Most of the people in our family love you enough not to keep hitting like on all the disgusting s*** that you post. I personally don't look at it . And I also know that it's a big f*** you mom when you do it . So let's not forget who your real family is. The ones who stand on God's word and want to see you go to heaven and not hell. That's what kills me the most Jacob is that your eternity is on the line here . you want to burn in hell just so you could sleep with Satan [that's how she refers to my boyfriend] that's your choice. There is nothing absolutely nothing you cannot be forgiven for. I love you immensely... and remember we all have to stand before God someday. Everybody misses you and I know that you miss us and you can lie to yourself all you want about that. We were always a close-knit family. So happy anniversary?""

The counsel I received from my last post told me to cut off communicating from my family until they explicitly acknowledged my sexuality and welcomed me back as a gay man. I have done so for the past several months and not responded to my family's emails or social media messages. 
My first instinct is of course to do the same here because I don't want to start an argument with a brick wall. At the same time, I feel like I should do something to either stop this disrespect from her. I'm kind of at a loss for how to proceed with this. Thank you guys again for your counsel and suggestions.

TL;DR 
Mom continues to try and put me through a guilt trip one year after she kicked me out for announcing I was in a gay relationship."
"Any other LTR gay couples in a dead bedroom?


Love my husband. Together 12 years.  But tired of the indifferent sex. We opened it up. He is more into the 3rd with sexual acts than with me. If I initiate topping him I get blocked. If the 3rd does he is all for it in every position. When we are alone I get all kinds of ""rules"" like ""No weight on me"" or ""Don't hug me too hard"" I have talked with him about it all a number of times. It gets better for a week. Then back to where it was. He is into other guys cums. Not mine. He is into rimming other guys. Not me. He is into being Vers with other guys. Not me. 

Besides sex. He is the best partner in every other way. 

Anyone else in the same situation? "
