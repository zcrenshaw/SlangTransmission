"UPDATE: I heard my little brother having sex with another boy several times. Should I say anything?


This is an update for [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/bu6weo/i_heard_my_little_brother_having_sex_with_another/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

Guys, your advice was something special. Out of 100 comments, 99 said contradictory things. Before I posted here, I wondered how I will word it without making it awkward, but after all of your talk about AIDS, predators and suicide, I totally freaked out. Say it like this, don't say it like that, you MUST do this, under NO circumstances do that... Come on!

Well, I'm only (partially) joking and your comments, as contradictory as they were, helped me realize there is lot more I need to be mindful of than ""not making it weird"". I took a risk and didn't listen to a lot of your advice, but it's still much appreciated and I learned a lot, so thank you all for taking the time to help me. &lt;3

On to the **actual update**:

I was planning on having a 1 on 1 talk with Luke, but the two of them are attached at the fucking hip. So, I waited until yesterday (Thursday) evening when I knew the 3 of us would be home alone because mom and dad take zumba classes lol. We had dinner and a regular conversation about how school was going and their plans for summer and college next year.

Finally, when they stopped talking and there was a short silence, I said (and I had literally written this sentence down and learned it by heart because I was freaking out so much): *So guys, I just wanted to let you know that a couple of days ago I heard some sounds coming from your room that you might not be comfortable having other people hear. It's really no big deal, I just figured if I was in your shoes, I'd want you to let me know*.

Luke was extremely confused and asked what I heard, and Mark, as far as I could tell, pulled Luke's hand and gave him a pretty telling side glance. Then they just stared at me, speechless, and it was super weird for a couple of seconds, so I kind of half-laughed and broke the silence by saying: *Guys, it's cool, don't worry about it. Your secret's safe with me.*

Since Luke was still speechless, Mark apologized for the noise and said they were honestly trying to be as quiet as possible and didn't realize I could hear it. And then Luke started talking and after some semi-explanations and apologies, he just came out to me.

He said they started off by just being friends about 3 years ago, then best friends, and around Christmas they admitted to each other they had feelings. They've been a couple since then. I told them I think it's awesome and wonderful and that I'm really happy for them and they seem like a great match, and I said if they ever need anyone to talk to or ask for advice or just a shoulder to cry on, they can always come to me. Luke seemed a bit teary-eyed so I gave him a hug.

I asked them if we needed to talk about safety and stuff and they looked horrified! The conclusion was that no, we don't need to because they know *everything*, so I asked what is *everything*, and they just awkwardly mumbled a couple of things like weneedcondoms andwemustgettested stdsarebad trustnoone encryptyourdickpics blah blah, which I figured was satisfactory enough for me to drop the subject.

I. Am. ELATED. I can't believe we all survived this. When I was packing my stuff and getting ready to leave this morning, Luke came into my room and hugged me and said I was awesome. We're not really a saying-I-love-you type of family, but I figure that's what he meant. So I told him he's awesome too. Yay!

Now I'm back home (away from home), all sad and single and alone in my flat so if you guys have any advice about ladies that I won't listen to and end up being equally successful, just let me know."

"I heard my little brother having sex with another boy several times. Should I say anything?


Hi all, I'm a non-gay older brother of an evidently gay little brother and I'm in a weird situation. I'm 22, he's 17, and I'll call him Luke. He hasn't come out so I'm just guessing he's gay. 

He's had this best friend (Mark) since they were about 14 and they are extremely close. Luke is more of an artistic type but he sucks at school. Mark is more academic and a straight A student and he helps Luke out a lot. They have pretty much had the same routine for the past 3 years - they go to school, come back to our home, go to Luke's room and study. Dinner at 7, and then more studying before Mark goes home at 11pm. He sleeps over on the weekends. Ever since then, Luke's grades have massively improved.

A few weeks ago, I started hearing stuff daily, just after dinner. At first, I thought it was music or the neighbors or something, but then I realized it sounds a lot like a bed squeaking and banging against the wall. I soon realized it was coming from Luke's room. Still, I thought who knows what they're doing, teenagers are weird.

But then this weekend when Mark slept over, I stayed up until about 4am (for unrelated reasons), and on my way to the bathroom, I actually heard two voices moaning from Luke's room.

So, I'm 99% sure they're having sex. Should I say anything to Luke? I would die if I knew people could hear me having sex and I'd want them to tell me. But Luke is not openly gay and I don't want to put him in an awkward situation. But then again, what if our parents hear it? This is probably not the way he'd want to come out to mom. Also, what if mom forbids Mark from coming over? I'm certain they're actually studying a lot of the time and that Mark is a positive influence on Luke since he has never had such good grades.

I don't actually live at home anymore, this is just temporary, and I'm leaving on Friday so I have a small window to deal with this, if I'm going to deal with it at all."
"Update on confronting my gay son


So I was told by the person that introduced me to Reddit that if a thread is popular you're supposed to update everyone.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bf3eyq/wibta_if_i_change_the_rules_for_friends_spending/

https://old.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/bg3lxt/should_i_confront_my_gay_son/

So I made those two threads.  This community seemed more interested so I figured I'd put the update here.  First of all I know I didn't respond to everyone, and if I had the time I would have loved to, but I didn't expect so many different comments, thank you for all of them.

So after telling my wife I anonymously asked a gay community online what to do she asked me what the conscious was.  I told her it was about 70/30 in not confronting him but assuring him we are supportive of the community.  

With that in mind we decided to make an appointment with a family therapist to get some ideas on what words to use, etc.  We made an appointment for a Friday afternoon for the two of us, thinking it could be a really long time before we need it, but it'll be good to have in case it comes soon.

The Tuesday (yes, the damn Tuesday) before the appointment when me and my wife are in the study my son comes in and goes ""can we talk?""  I say yes but I am thinking in my head 95% sure what this is about and if so I would have rather you wanted to the weekend, but I am glad you're telling us.  

Sure enough, it was the talk.  He told us everything, how him and Tyler are ""sort of dating"" etc.   So my wife asks what made you want to tell us now?  He said he wanted to be sure before he started tell us and didn't want to worry us.  My wife can be a little emotional and started crying and kept saying ""you never have to do that.  You can always talk to us, it's not a worry at all. etc.""

Once we got that out of the way my wife asks ""so are you 100% sure now?""  He said yes without a doubt (like I said before it's not surprising he's never shown any female interest, ever).  My wife bluntly went ""well I hope you know that this doesn't excuse you from using a condom, that just because you can't get pregnant, doesn't mean you can get an STD.""  He turned red, so I kind of steered the conversation away from that.  

So then we asked who else knows?  To our surprise he already told his siblings.  His older brother just said ""no shit, we share the same iPad.""  His younger sister was apparently surprised, but supportive. 

So then we asked if he's happy with himself.  He said he was, and he's got no issues with who is or anything etc.  So I asked ""are you sure, we want you to be happy, are you sure you're happy?  Nobody bothers you about this?""  His reply ""I am totally happy who I am not the one with the issue""  

Well what does that mean?  Apparently Noah has been coming out to all his friends and at school is pretty much out.  He said no issues and he's happy being out, but Tyler on the other hand.... is very much still in the closet.  So now that Noah is coming out Tyler doesn't want to be seen with the gay kid, because he's worried people will think that he's gay.  

Honestly, that kind of threw me for a curve ball.  It makes sense, I just hadn't thought of it before.  So basically lately Tyler has been pulling back because he doesn't want to be outed.  So my wife asked how did you guys end up together if he was in the closet?  Noah claims he came out to Tyler months ago, and Tyler made him not to promise to tell anyone but he he was gay too, and after awhile they just kind of clicked and stared dating.  

So my wife had the idea to bring him to our appointment Friday to get someone to talk to about the situation.  The guy he had was very good, and gave out some good advice.    Noah again assured us he's very happy with himself although he did throw in the line ""I would be even happier if I got a car early.""  It was a nice try but no lol.  In our state you get a provisional license at 16 (which he has) and then at 16.5 you get a full license.  He's going to have to wait like his brother did for 16.5 lol.  

So we hadn't dealt with the sleep situation yet because we had been busy and it hadn't been a problem.  Noah hadn't had Tyler or anyone spend the night, but sure enough on cue once my oldest son knew that we knew he comes up with ""so since Noah can have his boyfriend spend the night I want my girlfriend to spend the night.""

So me and the wife agreed.  They can both have their SO spend the night in the den with the TV as long as the parents agreed.  Ironically his girlfriends parents are against it, which I get.  

At this time Tyler has started to miss Noah and stared coming back to him, but he's still very much in the closet.  Tyler still doesn't even know that we know about the situation.  

It sounds like everything went really well for Noah, so I am hoping Tyler sees that and decides to copy him.  I asked Noah how Tyler's parents would probably feel about the situation and he said he wasn't sure?  Like I said before they seem like nice people but no idea how they'd feel having a gay son.

Tyler is actually spending the night tonight because tomorrow school is closed.  It's the first time since this thread happened that he's sleeping and I guess we will make the beds on the two couches.  It's what reminded me about this thread in the first place.  

So that's pretty much the update, I am not really sure what else I am missing here, but I am sure I am forgetting some details.  Also please excuse my grammar, and long story lol.  I am a Sales Engineer and it's definitely not my strong suit at all.  

Thanks again for all the advice.  Everything is going great with Noah, and I hope that Tyler can reach that too as well.  Tyler will be a junior in fall so I hope he doesn't have to wait until college to do that.  

I guess time will tell us, thanks for reading and have a great Memorial Day weekend!"

"Did I make a mistake by telling my ex I got an upgrade in front of 20 people, causing his new boyfriend to leave him?


My ex was always ***incredibly*** jealous and that was the main reason why we broke up. We were together for 3 years and we broke up about 3 years ago. However, we have a lot of mutual friends so we still run into each other here and there. About 1.5 year ago, I started dating someone else. Ever since my ex found out, he has used every opportunity to attempt to shit all over my boyfriend.

Several months ago, the two of them met at a party. Before we got there, I told my boyfriend my ex was going to be there and to just ignore him in case he says something idiotic, just smile and nod and try to get away from him as soon as possible. This was exactly what happened, they met, my ex made multiple rude, snarky comments, we found an excuse to dump him and went to chat to other people.

Since then, we saw him another 3-4 times, each time being on the receiving end of rude, snarky comments, each time smiling and getting away asap. This past weekend, we were supposed to go to a friend's place to hang out and the ex was coming too. My boyfriend seemed exhausted at the very mention of my ex's name and said he didn't want to go and listen to the same crap over and over again, but I managed to persuade him to come along.

When we arrived, about 20 people were there already, including my ex's new boyfriend, and it took my ex an entirety of 30 seconds before he and his boyfriend came over to us. The first thing he said was: ""Oh, are you guys still together? OP, is this your record for how long you've tolerated someone who isn't your type?""

I told him that no, that was him. And he said: ""Please, don't compare me to... this."" and he pointed to my boyfriend head to toe. So I told him: ""I really don't understand what you mean by that since it's obvious my boyfriend is in every single way an upgrade from you. He's a nicer person, pleasant to be around, he's more intelligent than you, more successful, funnier, sexier, and he's actually good in bed."" 

My ex opened his mouth to say something, but I said: ""And also, he's not a jealous c\*nt that goes through my phone because of an inferiority complex."" Then I took my boyfriend by the hand and we went into the kitchen to get drinks.

Later, a friend told me my ex and his boyfriend had a fight and the boyfriend ended up dumping him and leaving.

I honestly don't know if my ex is still a jealous c\*nt and if I actually helped his boyfriend, but I feel kind of bad for causing this. I have no idea what their relationship was like and what sort of dynamic they had. My boyfriend keeps telling me that if it had been good enough, it wouldn't have been destroyed by one comment I made. But I can't help feeling guilty."
"Today My dad met my BF of 10 years, I've never come out to him.


Some context. My step mother has know of my relationship for 6 years. My father isn't the sort of person who is supportive of gay people. 

Last weekend out of the blue I received a message from my step mother saying 'I've talked to you father and we would both love it if you and [OH] would come visit us'

Obviously this sent me into both a rage and utter anxiety. He doesn't know. I've never told him. She has been speaking to him about what doesn't concern her. 

Anyway. I've been contemplating pulling out all week, but we both bit the bullet and went along. 

I've never ever seen my father like he was today.

Warm, receptive, funny and ACCEPTING. It was a wonderful experience. We went for lunch, had a few drinks and he treated the OH like he's always been there and they have known each other for years. 

He didn't question my life, he didn't ask 'why?' Anything, we sat together and shot the shit about life in general for hours. 


I don't know how to feel."

"Hooked up with a gay friend...


So I identify as straight and my friend came out last year. We went out for his birthday and at the club started rolling on molly. Molly makes most people extra affectionate and feel a very close bond. I was staying at his place because I live out of town for the summer and when we got back from the club I hopped into the shower where my friend joined me. I was pretty drunk and high and didn't care. Then after the shower he gave me a kiss. The kiss felt so passionate and I was high so I was craving some kind of touch. We made out for a long time before he started giving me an amazing blowjob. I tried returning the favor but my jaw was already very sore and so instead I ate his ass. We just lay there kissing and jerking each other off for a very long time before we both came. All in all it was probably 2 hours of very intimate play.

I tend to have bad comedowns so the next day so I didn't really talk much just chilled on the couch and drifted in and out of naps. I stayed over a second night and nothing happened, he didn't try to make anything happen either. I left the next morning and we haven't really spoken much since and everything is feeling a bit awkward. I think he knows that the hookup was only because of the molly but I'm not sure where to go from here.  I don't know if he has feelings for me or if it was only a high hookup for him as well. The problem is it was very intimate and not like a sloppy drunk hookup but the molly made it a very intense feeling for both of us. I'm not really sure if I should approach the subject or just ignore it."
"Does anyone know why middle aged straight people can’t seem to call the significant other of a gay person ‘boyfriend’ or ‘husband’


Why is it that middle aged straight people can’t get a grasp on using the same words they use for themselves in reference to someone’s singing I can’t other. I find it so cringey when they try and reference a guys husband or something and they stand there trying to find the right word word to use. Then I’m standing here for 30 seconds listening to them stumble to find the word and then proceed to call them ‘partner’ or ‘mate’.

"Soo I sucked my first dick last night....


Alrighty so basically being in my early twenties Ive already been around the block and around the corner with girls. They are pretty good I'd say... I do find having sex with women to be fun and enjoyable. Lately I have been thinking about guys every now and then. 

Well curiosity got the best of me and the other night I met a guy online and met up with him. After a short walk and talking a bit we ended up on his couch and I started to get the butterflies as I knew things were about to happen. We kinda quickly kissed and I just went right for it and unzipped his pants. My thoughts then were ""well fuck here we go"". Two things immediately raced through my mind the moment I put his dick in. 1, The smell was intoxicatingly amazing. 2, Having my mouth full felt incredible. A minute later I realized I was more turned on and hard then Ive ever been with a girl.   

Basically I had never been so horny and had so much fun and all because I was blowing some guys dick. Obviously afterwards I had a moment of wondering what exactly I see coming in the future... Things are probably going to shift a bit!"
"What today means to me


My husband and I have been together 20 years. We have 1 son from his previous marriage and 4 adapted sons and 1 daughter. My husband was in the military for 15 years. 2 of our other sons were also in the military. We lived thru several deployments. Phone calls in the middle of the night from Iraq, and Afghanistan.  Eventually they came home and we thought all was well. About a year after our oldest son came home, after all that, he committed suicide.  You really cant know what that is like unless you have gotten that news. I cry as I write this post but it's important. Over 20 soldiers a day commit suicide.  20. He was given full military honors. Yes, Memorial Day is a day off. We still grill out with our kids. We have fun. But please dont forget that all heroes do not die on the battlefield.  During the day. Try and think about the fallen. Use this day as a teaching tool to talk with your family what it's all about. I'm missing him today. I miss him everyday. Talk to a soldier. Talk with their family. We cant forget their war is not over."
"Is it just me, or do guys become much more attractive when you find out they are openly gay?


I don't know if its just a thing with me, but yeah I'll think a straight guy is attractive, but when I find out that a guy for certain is gay, I feel this ""spark"" of attraction towards him. Like, even if he is an average looking dude, I'll start feeling attraction for him."

"When a hookup or guy on an app treats you like a human.


A couple years ago, I started become more personable when it came to hookups and talking to guys on apps. I realized how much I didn't like being treated like a piece of meat, so why would I do that in return?

So when I meet guys to hook up (which I don't do too often anymore) I make sure I am as personable as possible, first to make it more comfortable and enjoyable, and also because they are human being just not a piece of meat. 

Since I have done that I have found it so interesting. So when I arrive at hookup's place, I chit chat for a bit, if I see a poster or something in their place that looks cool I ask them about, joke around with them. Basically I treat them as someone who might have been introduced to me through a friend, a situation where I would take an interest and treat them like a human being. Then we have sex, and then I continue to talk to them afterwards for a little bit before I leave, even joking around and what not. 

It's interesting because almost with every guy, they almost seem dumbfounded by my kindness but also very appreciative of it. You won't believe how many times when I am about to head out the door, the guy will say"" You know you were a really nice guy. Most guys just come in have sex and walk out."" It actually usually leads with them wanting to keep in contact with me, which I agree to, and we might touch base here an there or fool around again. But it's a positive experience for them not only sexually but emotionally.  

There are even incidents when I get to a guy's place not feeling him, and decide to not have sex with him and leave, but I do it in a very humane way too. Like the last guy I decided to no go through with the hookup, as I started to put on some clothes I had taken off, I started to compliment his beautiful house, asked what his cats names were, and as I was putting my shoes on curious as to what he did for a profession. So even though I rejected him, I did so nicely, and on my way home he texted me and said he appreciated my honesty and he thought I was very nice, that he appreciated that I wasn't a jerk. 

I also do the same thing on the apps when chatting with someone and get similar feedback. It's actually nice to see guys feel in a way valued, and in a sense  I think it makes them feel better about themselves and the hookup doesn't feel as empty. I can tell the difference in their faces as compared to the past when it was just a pump and go. 

Curious what are your experiences with this? When a guy, even though when it's clear it's just a hookup or app chat, nothing more, treats you more like a human? Albeit someone you are attracted to as well."
"Why are gay men so hot and cold?


I met up with a guy on grindr and we got on really well, we talked for quite a while before we got it on. BTW amazing sex went there in total bottom mode but he suddenly pulled out and started riding me :). Anyway he asked me for my phone number and said we should see eachother again ie on a date not just sex. It's been a week and I have heard nothing. So fucking annoying. I don't get why people say one thing and do another. What happened to being upfront and honest."

"Have you ever jerked off 'in the presence of'/with friends? Am I the only one who has had uneventful school years?

so I came across this video while browsing for some porn

 [https://www.pornhub.com/view\_video.php?viewkey=ph5a5467e0c7a4d](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5a5467e0c7a4d) 

&amp;#x200B;

and I simply find the interaction simply fascinating. The dude is just casually jerking off and watching pron, even though his friend is in the room. He even allows him to keep recording.

When I was a teen, not once did I ever get to see anybody naked, let alone have someone jerk off in my presence like that. 

Is this normal/common? Do friends casually jerk off togther and not care? I feel like I have missed out a lot..."
