"IT’S OKAY TO REJECT GRINDR HOOKUPS IN PERSON. IF THE PERSON IS NOT WHO THEY SAID THEY WERE, OR IT DOESN’T FEEL RIGHT, YOU CAN REJECT THEM


Sorry for the caps. I just had a scary grindr encounter which I wanna share with you, to make sure you guys are safe.
So, I’m not that much into the whole random hookup situation. I like hooking up as much ad the next guy, but not with a random guy I’ve never met before. Or at least, that used to be the case. 
I go to a small college in a medium-sized city in a rather conservative state. Basically, there aren’t that many gays here. There’s some, but not a lot. I just finished my freshman year and I can count with my fingers the amount of gay guys I’ve met and hooked and stuff. Basically, one can feel lonely. That’s understandable. In high school I saw all my straight friends making out with girls and having sex and that just wasn’t the case for me for the sole reason that there weren’t guys to do that with. 
College was a similar scenario. There were some guys, but not as many as there were girls for my friends. I decide to try grindr. There’s a lot of crazy guys out there. You gotta be careful. I thought I was being careful.
Try it, end up meeting two guys in a college nearby and it’s fine. Then, I meet this 26-year-old guy who has a blurry pic of him but he looks good. He talks to me and he’s s gentleman. Super respectful and all.
We text. He’s really nice. Really proper, so we agree to meet. Something about this guy felt kinda weird though.
I invite him over to my dorm since my roommates were gone. I, invited a stranger, an unknown man with one pic to the location where I go to school, live, and where I am pretty much all the time during school. I gave him access to a lot of my life only because I felt lonely and he was nice.
He agrees to come at 8. The guy is kinda sketchy, since he doesn’t have a car even though he told me he’s 26 and he keeps calling the “cap company.” He can’t get an uber because he doesn’t have a credit nor a debit card. Something’s weird.
It’s 9 and 10pm and he’s still trying to get a taxi, which is delayed and can’t pick him up until later. The guy ends up coming at midnight. I feel lonely, so I don’t think of this gyy being kinda weird (he never asked to see a pic of me and his language was very weird, like almost calculated.)
He texts me he’s arriving so I go to the place where I said we’d meet up. It’s midnight, and it’s the week after finals so most people in the college have left. It’s dark and there’s no people around and he’s sitting on a bench under a tree with no light. I walk towards him. He sees me and starts walking towards me, but he looks weird. So I stop walking and I wait for him to walk into the light.
He was, in fact, the same person in the only photo he had. But he wasn’t 26 years old. His hair looked healthy in the front, but in the back you could that it belonged to an old man. The guy was tall and was at least 35-years-old. He could even be in his forties.
Reminder: I am an 18-year-old guy standing in an empty college parking lot at midnight with a guy I randomly met online. I am a pretty reasonable guy and I never thought I’d do something like this. I felt lonely so I took what I could get, but this situation was dangerous. I’m kind of a small guy. A bigger man could pull up a gun or knife or whatever and I wouldn’t know what to do. 
I ask the guy how old he is. He replied he’s 26, and he looks super weird. I tell him he doesn’t look like he’s 26 and he repeats he is. I ask him if he can show me his ID to prove me that he’s 26, since I feel uncomfortable. He tells me it’s not possible.
The guy was being nice but still weird, so I tell him that I feel uncomfortable and that I don’t wanna go through with what we agreed. As soon as I say this, the guy starts twitching. I’m keeping my distance while I talk to him.
The guy says that whatever we do is up to me and I tell him I think he should leave.
I’m shaking as I say this. The guy agrees, turns around and leaves.
No. More. Random. Grindr. Hookups.
I can’t believe I put myself in such a dangerous situation all because I felt upset that I wasn’t get laid as much as my straight friends do. That’s stupid. Guys, your safety is first. ALWAYS! If something wver doesn’t feel right, WALK AWAY. Don’t feel bad about the other person. Your own safety is always first. 
Never trust a profile of a person you met online. I learnt my lesson thankfully without major consequences, but that’s not the case for many people. 
Please guys, be safe. Always be safe. Don’t wait until you learn your lesson the hard way because it might end up with you getting hurt.

Summary: I’m an 18-year-old freshman in college who felt lonely because there were no other gay guys. I decided to hookup with people on grindr and talk to this nice though sketchy guy who says he’s 26. I invite him to my dorm at 8pm and he doesn’t show up until midnight in the empty, dark parking lot of my college with no people around since finals are over and most people have moved out. When he stands in the light, I notice the guy is a man who is at least 35/40 years old and I’m scared. I asked him to leave to which he agreed. Learning: don’t trust rsndom hookups online. DON’T PUR YOUR OWN SAFETY AY RISK OVER S DIGITAL DICK THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN EXIST!!

Be safe y’all. Love you. Have a good one."
"Fun Fact: Pete Buttigieg is the only candidate who talks about the high rates of LGBTQ teen suicides and trans women of color murders.


It seems LGBT rights are yesterday's story for most of the presidential candidates now. But it's part of Pete Buttigieg's life. 

Let's not forget about that. He's one of us."
"Last night I saw my ex and I realized some things


I’m always going to love you and even though we fizzled out to nothing, hearing you say you miss me while you’re drunk gives me some clarity.

Any other time I would have ran back into your arms, possibly stayed the night, and then woke up the next morning to guilt and questioning the back-and-forth cycle. 

Last night when you said you missed me I chose not to give in to those old feelings because they don’t serve me anymore.

I loved the hell out of you, but that love has changed. I was an emotional wreck when we were together but I’ve never been so level-headed and in control of my emotions like I am now.

I’ve always set myself on fire to keep other people warm, especially you.

I miss you too. I love you too, but I love me more."
"Does anyone else ONLY like amateur porn?


I can’t even watch produced prob. Idk why, it’s just a turn off for me. Can anyone relate?"
"How many of us have an absolute weakness for short guys?


For me, if a hot guy is short he's twice as hot. I'm a bit shorter than the average in my country. I have been in dates with guys way shorter than me and all those times I've been blown off my feet. Somehow having a guy come to my nose/mouth makes him super attractive if he's already hot. 

Yesterday I stood behind a guy in a line that took this to the extreme. He must have been around five feet tall, with a movie star face and built like a brick house, and I simply could not stop staring at him. Damn. DAMN. 

(He was there with his girlfriend, though, so no chance)

So... how many of you have this weakness?"
"My ""straight bf"" kissed a man in front of me


So I dont really know how to feel. I am a female, and my boyfriend insisted on going to a gay bar, which was fun and then he asked a man to kiss him and they kissed in front of me. 
Now my bf is not bi... or so he says... but he had 0 hesitation kissing a man. And he is not a social butterfly.. this was totally our of character for him. This came out of left field. When I asked him the next day about it he got defensive and insisted that I was making fun of him and making him feel bad and told me not to tell anyone. 
1. I would absolutely never make fun of him for anything, especially if he is gay. I love him very much and as much as it would hurt me to lose him as a lover, I would still be a supportive friend for him. 
2. I feel that hes in the denial phase. I'm his first gf and his first sexual partner. I believe he needs to get out there and explore his options.
3. Is it selfish to not want to be the girlfriend he keeps around for appearences?? Like I'm getting old and I need to have my life start, we arent in highschool so I dont have 10 years to wait for him to finally come out. 
4. He and I have been working on our relationship because we have had alot of problems.. and I'm wondering now, maybe I need to cut contact and let it be over? 

I just need some advice. 
I've been crying since it happened. 
I havent been able to look at him and I refused to let him touch me or kiss me since it happened. I feel like I was betrayed. 
Also, he keeps belittling my feelings because he compared my sexual encounters with females in the past to this. But I explained to him that I know my sexuality and I'm not in the middle of figuring it out while being in a long term relationship, I had my exploring days before we got into this relationship years ago."
"My birthday is tomorrow and I thought I should tell you guys since everyone I know will forget [19m]


I know my friends didn’t plan something like they do for our other friends and my mom has me blocked on her phone right now so I’m sure my family won’t do a cake for me either (not that they did last year).

I’m turning twenty and I’m just sad and scared because I also know I’ll never find or be able to keep a partner. How could anybody love me when my parents, my friends, and I can’t even love me?"
"Is it really that weird to want to meet a grindr hookup in public?


Newly minted gaybro here and obviously new to grindr.

I've gotten a fair bit of interest and am one of the apparently mythical unicorns that can host. But I want to know who I'm letting into my home so I always ask if they want to get a drink first, I live only 5 mins walk away from some nice bars. But as soon as I say I want to meet in public first dudes act like I am making outrageous unreasonable demands or something. It's a bit of a trip asking a bloke out for a beer, what I thought would be an obvious sign of interest, only to get turned down because they can't come straight home.

Am I being extra here?"
"Do you guys find James Charles annoying?


I’m sorry if I offend anyone for whatever reason. But even as a gay dude I can’t stand him, he seems so egotistical and narcissistic it’s disgusting. And his voice? Forget it I get that being gay you can express yourself good for you but if you just make that your whole persona it’s gonna be pretty annoying. I feel ashamed when my straight friends thinks of a gay dude they think of him instead of a normal guy like me."
"Sick of this racist shit.


Just want to get this off my chest.

As someone who looks Pakistani but isn't, I get treated better by straight people reacting to the fact that I'm gay better than how I've been ""welcomed"" by our community.

Like there's literally NOWHERE at all for me and it makes me feel suffocated and unsure why I keep trying. I stopped going out to bars and clubs because of all the shitty comments I've heard during people's conversations and I've always loved to go out. 

I grew up in America and live in one of the most diverse places in the country (South Florida) and it still sucks. I know that it's not that I'm not weird or look like a wreck because before I came out I never felt this level of racism anywhere. 

Like I just don't get it.....If you've ever struggled to come out and have been lumped into all the horrible gay stereotypes out there in the past. how can you do the same to another person? 
Even the threads on here are full of racist shit....

To all of the people who make room for minorities in LGBT spaces. You don't even understand how much I appreciate you. PLEASE never stop."
"We need more romantic youthful gay men movies on HBO, Netflix


With attractive men, going on dates. Cliche shit we all wish we could enjoy doing in real life. I see nothing on these two streaming services I use. Only stupid dumb porn story lines or drag queens screaming for no reason."
"Brother walked in on me and my bf (not out)


I’m home with my older brother this week because our parents are away. He’s 21 and I’m 16. So tonight we’re suppose to go get dinner around 7:30, after he knocks off from work. 

I figured because he would be at work I had the house to myself, and so I invited my boyfriend over. One thing leads to another and we’re on the couch, in our underwear making out. 

I don’t know how I didn’t hear his car pull up, or the door open, but in walks my brother, who sees us. This is how my brother finds out I’m gay. Im so embarrassed and also scared right now bros. I’ve been outed by my brother catching my boyfriend on top of me. 

My brother said “oh shit, sorry didn’t mean to walk in, I just need my phone charger”. He ran up to his room, got his charger and then headed back out. On his way out he said “see you at 7:30 if you still want to get food”. And he texted a couple minutes after he left and said “you can bring your friend if you want, too”. So I guess maybe he’s OK with it? I just don’t know. 

I feel like such an idiot right now. On the couch and he walked in, how fucking cliche. Bros im so embarrassed. My boyfriend left a few minutes after my brother did. And there’s literally no food here, so if i want to eat I have to go dinner with him, it’s gonna be so awkward. I don’t know, what should I do? Can’t believe I was so dumb, I just want to cry."
"An interesting that just happened, on my birthday.


Medium length story, sorry if my writing is bad I'm not the best at typing shit out longform haha. 

It's my birthday today but since I've been outta work for awhile, I had kinda reconciled with myself that I wouldn't be going out or doing anything crazy this weekend and will just celebrate the occasion on my own at home. 

Anyway last night just before 12 I'm browsing Grindr and I find a guy not too far from me so I head over to his place. I get there, he's super cute which is a surprise given that my area is kind of a post apocalyptic wasteland and we get straight down to it. We have great chemistry and just start making out for a solid 5 min. We stop for a sec, he looks over at the clock which says 12 and he sighs saying: ""It's my birthday today."" I'm shook. I tell him it's mine too and we kinda just look at each other for a sec in disbelief before laughing. Turns out we're turning the same age as well and were both feeling the exact same feelings of apprehension upon turning it. We ended up having a really fun time over the next hour and a good talk before I left his place.

I don't believe in that astrology/universe-has-a-plan bullshit but the timing of this fun hookup with a gorgeous dude is so uncanny, I almost feel like the cosmos was just like ""psst, hey man; I know we ain't talk much but here, have this one on me"" and sent me a really cool freebie haha. All I know is I'm having a good birthday today. :)"
"Gay cover for the main french sport daily newspaper


It's here : https://medias.lequipe.fr/img-photo-jpg/la-une-du-magazine-l-equipe-ce-samedi-04-mai-l-equipe/1500000001143468/0:0,1181:1594-665-0-70/396d4.jpg

Not so much a question, but for gays here, it was kind the event of the day. What the big news, you would ask me : it's not the first time a newspaper or magazine put gay guys on cover, the country is more or less tolerant...

But the thing is that ""L'équipe"" is the main (if not only ?) sport newspaper here. It's huge, everyone reads it. It's one of the most popular newspaper in the country, the thing read by the more popular people, in coutryside, suburbs, everywhere. Also read by a lot of urban / upper class people, in fact, because it's a really good newspaper, but anyway : take all the homophobic people of the country, the one your forget and not often hear, put them together : a huge part of them will read this newspaper daily. For comparaison, it's like if the main popular newspaper of deep texas was putting a gay kiss on cover.

I've not read it yet (it's a big sum up of the state of homophobia in sport), but the day have been full of angry reactions on the web - ""proselytism"", ""sexuality is a private matter"", ""decadence of the west""... Like a big reminder that the country is not here yet.

Thought it was important enough to be shared !"
"Old Lady Decides Gays Are Okay


This is an excerpt from this week's This American Life, which was actually a rebroadcast from 2000.  They interviewed random people at a Chicago diner.  I absolutely love this part.  It makes me proud of my community, and is a great example of how attitudes can be changed with kindness over confrontation.

""The  neighborhood has changed a lot, you know? A whole lot. Some for the  better, some for the worse. Close by, we have our gay people, which we  never had as a kid. They were around, maybe, but we didn't know who they  were. Today, you know who they are.

""My  husband, coming from the old school-- we have the nicest neighbors we've  ever had, two gay men. They can't do enough for you. They cut your  grass for you. They water-- now that I'm older. And when they moved in,  my husband, coming from way back, oh, my god, you know, he didn't want  really too much to do with them.

""Within a  year, I'd say, we saw that they were nice people, very clean. And when  we had our 50th wedding anniversary party, had some \[NON-ENGLISH\] here,  it was our neighbors that went to the hall without any-- they wouldn't  take a penny. They decorated that place like you wouldn't believe. Now,  how many neighbors would do that for you, you know?

""So  gay or not gay, they're really nice people. So I think that the gays  can be credited for being such a nice people. They swayed a lot of the  old-time people into different thinking. There's still a lot of racial  stuff. Maybe if you had a black neighbor here, or one of the people  would rent to a black person, I think they'd be frowned upon a little  bit. But if you rent to a gay person today, it's OK.

""A  lot of things that we think should be this way and that way as you grow  up, it's really not that way, shouldn't be that way. So I don't feel  that we should really judge them, you know?"""
"Do you ever wish you could tell someone that they're gay?


Let me explain with a real life scenario:

There was this guy called Charlie at my ex's (Daniel) work who was 19 and soon to be married to his high school sweetheart. Daniel would often tell me how interested Charlie was in our sex life. Charlie would ask questions like:

""What does it feel like to be fucked""

""How do you avoid mess""

Etc

Daniel and I were almost sure Charlie was gay and that he was going to break his fiancee's heart, but we reasoned there was nothing we could politely do about it.

A few months later, Charlie is married with a baby on the way. I stop by Daniel's work one day, meet Charlie and he literally reminds me of Jack off Will and Grace.

A few more months after that, Charlie leaves his pregnant wife and very soon after gets a boyfriend and comes out. Years go by and he's now married to his new boyfriend and has little to do with his child.

So that's why I wish we could've told Charlie he was gay. Could've saved a lot of heartache and complications."
"Saudi Arabia: “Easier to be gay than straight”


[The Kingdom in the Closet](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/the-kingdom-in-the-closet/305774/)

&amp;#x200B;

Sodomy is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia, but gay life flourishes there. Why it is “easier to be gay than straight” in a society where everyone, homosexual and otherwise, lives in the closet.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s a lot easier to be gay than straight here. If you go out with a girl, people will start to ask her questions. But if I have a date upstairs and my family is downstairs, they won’t even come up.”

 But what seems more startling, at least from a Western perspective, is that some of the men having sex with other men don’t consider themselves gay. For many Saudis, the fact that a man has sex with another man has little to do with “gayness.” The act may fulfill a desire or a need, but it doesn’t constitute an identity. Nor does it strip a man of his masculinity, as long as he is in the “top,” or active, role. This attitude gives Saudi men who engage in homosexual behavior a degree of freedom.

“It’s easier to be a lesbian \[than a heterosexual\]. There’s an overwhelming number of people who turn to lesbianism,” Yasmin said, adding that the number of men in the kingdom who turn to gay sex is even greater. “They’re not really homosexual,” she said. “They’re like cell mates in prison.” 

 Some Saudi \[men\] can’t have sex with women, so they have sex with guys. When the sexes are so strictly segregated”—men are allowed little contact with women outside their families, in order to protect women’s purity—“how do they have a chance to have sex with a woman and not get into trouble?” Tariq, a 24-year-old in the travel industry, explains that many “tops” are simply hard up for sex, looking to break their abstinence in whatever way they can. Francis, a 34-year-old beauty queen from the Philippines (in 2003 he won a gay beauty pageant held in a private house in Jeddah by a group of Filipinos), reported that he’s had sex with Saudi men whose wives were pregnant or menstruating; when those circumstances changed, most of the men stopped calling. “If they can’t use their wives,” Francis said, “they have this option with gays.”

Gay courting in the kingdom is often overt—in fact, the preferred mode is cruising. “When I was new here, I was worried when six or seven cars would follow me as I walked down the street,” Jamie, a 31-year-old Filipino florist living in Jeddah, told me. “Especially if you’re pretty like me, they won’t stop chasing you.” John Bradley, the author of *Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis* (2005), says that most male Western expatriates here, gay or not, have been propositioned by Saudi men driving by “at any time of the day or night, quite openly and usually very, very persistently.”"
