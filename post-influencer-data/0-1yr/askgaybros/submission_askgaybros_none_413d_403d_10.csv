"Outted in the worst fucking way possible and could use some reassurance


I'm still pretty rocked by all this. It seems like today just flew by but has also just taken fucking forever.

I'm in college and taking summer classes. At the start of the year I broke up with my girlfriend. I know it's cliche and all that, but I'm straight acting, kinda bro looking, but I just couldn't fake it anymore. We broke up in January and I've been exploring my sexuality since. It's been amazing, and I've kinda dived right in, but I still present as straight and haven't come out to anyone. 

I started secretly dating this guy a few months ago. He knew I was low key about being gay and has been amazing about it all. We got physical pretty fast and every once in awhile, late night or if the mood struck, his roommate would also join in on the fun. 

So, kick off summer classes. My boyfriend said I could crash with him for the summer because their lease ends beginning of August. I got out of my summer dorm thing and have been staying with him for two months now. This summer has been filled with sex and I'm just happy to be myself and have fun.

Until this morning. Like it makes me sick to my stomach because even writing this it sounds like some fucking horrible movie plot or something.  My parents go on this summer road trip to see national parks every year in their camper. They were supposed to swing by tonight,  we were hoping to grab dinner,  and then they'd be on their way in the morning. I don't know if they skipped something or went 100 mph over the past two days,  but they showed up at our place this morning, a full 12 hours earlier than expected.  

I'm literally just nauseous typing this. They tried calling me this morning but my phone was upstairs charging. My boyfriend, roommate and I were tanning on our back patio and doing some morning drinking. Things happened and soon we're having some fun together in the sun. It gets a bit more intense and since we have music going and are a little drunk we don't hear my parents enter and make their way to the where the music is coming from. 

I'm being fucking spit roasted when they see me. I don't immediately register that they're there but my boyfriend does, yells ""what the fuck,"" and I turn to see my dad and mom basically running out of the house. They saw everything, they left,  they won't return my calls, and I'm fucking devastated. I've been my dad's ""man"" for my whole life and he just saw me taking dick. I just went from responsible son to gay in a split second and I'm just so broken. I feel like I let them down. 

I don't know what to do. I'm just... fuck. "
"So... Here was happened when I met with my parents after 7 years....


TL:DR
FUCKING TERRIBLE.
Decided to leave after receiving multiple insults, father threw a glass at head.
Causing my partner (that was in disguise) 
To smack him in the face while my other disguised friend carried me outside. 
Barowner called the police. And I had a lovely afternoon in the hospital.... 

______

I've been thinking it over for a while to even post it. But because some people in the last post wanted an update... and I need a place to vent a bit. Here it comes... 
It's been a week since...

I arranged a meeting a local coffee place around noon. I arrived 30 minutes earlier, took a seat and my disguised partner and his best friend took a seat a bit futher away in view. 
(hat and glasses)

So. Both of my parents walked in, I was quite surprised that my dad was even there. It wasn't very clear if both of them where coming. 

Instantly it felt awkward and forced. My mother greeted me. Wanted to kiss my cheek but I gave a handshake. My dad immediatly sat down and said nothing after an obligatory 'hello' 

My mother immediatly bombared me with small-talk. About work. My new house. My new garden.... I kept my answers short but polite. However my mother kept interrupting me every time I wanted to tell a little bit more detail. 
I noticed my father was staring out the window with his arms crossed. He sometimes made a small 'snark' noise. I noticed he kept staring at my watch....
I was slightly annoyed at that. But the conversation with my mother went on....

At a sudden moment she asked about my partner. She asked what work he did. But suddenly my dad interrupted her and asked another question about my house. My mother suddenly bounced back and remained quiet. So I felt somewhat annoyed but I answered the question. He asked me for how much I bought my house and other detailed questions. I decided to remain a bit vague. 
Suddenly he called me an idiot for not being honest about the house's price. I told him that I dont want to discuss that now.
It became awkwardly quiet for sometime... 
After a few more back and forths between my mother and I. 

His attitude bothered me greatly. 
Couldn't deal with putting up a facade.
And decided to call them out why they wanted to meet. 

He then said this beautiful gem: 
""We can't let our child die of disease""
I asked him. ""What do you mean: disease?"" ""Well you are not dead yet."" He answered...
""What do you mean I'm dead yet?""

I look him straight in the eyes and he said:

""You have AIDS. You can't possibly think to throw us in debt because you live a lifestyle you cannot afford.""

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN SAYING. I DO NOT HAVE AIDS. FATHER WHAT THE HELL""
 (for the record I do not have HIV.  Practice Safe Sex, boys.) 

He then said: ""You're a Faggot, Max. If you don't have it now. You'll have it sooner or later. And I won't let you put me in debt because you think you can be better than me with your fancy clothes, watch and phone"" 

I lost it. was so completely thrown off gaurd. I stood up. Screamed so many things at his face. I can't even remember but it became a shouting match....Everyone started looking and my partner was already to intervene.

Now from here things went completely horseshit... I stood up and walked away from the table. My mother in tears and my father yelling all the common insults once more...
And then he threw a glass Hitting the back of my head.

While Kev (the other friend) rushed to my side. My partner stormed at my father and punch him right in the face....Kev helped me outside. Where we sat at the terrace. While the waiter
helped me with my head. 

Because I was outside. I missed a lot of what my partner said to him... And I honestly don't want to know... 
And so. The barowner called the cops...

In the end. The barowner and waiter testified I was attacked... It was a lovely afternoon at the ER... It was just a small cut. 
But they wanted to be sure...

I hope this will never happen to anyone...
I put my faith in hoping maybe, just maybe, They had changed. That he had changed....
In the end I was betrayed once more...

But that will never happen again.
I've learned that lesson once again. 

Kind regards,
A depressed Bro.

"Why are so many gay guys so fucking stupid?


Unlike PreP, condom prevents you from not only HIV but also from catching nasty shit like gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital fucking warts and herfuckingpes. 

Especially herpes, because you young motherfuckers are ALL moody bitches. And moody bitches gets herpes sores.

Save that creampie moment for your significant other, you stupid cum hungry cunt.

Stop making it seems like barebacking with a stranger is hot. It's not hot, it's dumb. Play stupid games wins stupid prizes you bitch."
"Big dicks are way to overrated


The guy I'm in a relationship with right now is about 8"" long and 1"" thicc or so. Most of you would freak out and obsess over that, however last night when we got some alone time I learned big dicks fucking suck. The whole time he had to stop because it was hurting and the only real pleasure I got from it was knowing that he enjoyed it. Even at the end he said that he hates being so big because it hurts anyone he's with. I think I'm gonna top next time. But anyways moral of the story 5""/6"" dicks are way preferable to magnum dongs."
"Are there any old guys here?


Like 60+?

If so, do you feel like shooting the shit?

How are you doing?"
"I dont really have too many people to share this with but I've lost 10 pounds!


It's not a whole lot but I'm trying and getting there day by day :)

According to the app I use I should get to my goal weight of 200 by October/November!"
"Do people think it’s edgy or something that they eat pizza?


I see in profiles all the time, “something gym/health/business..... OR MAYBE A PIZZA LMAO” as if liking pizza is unpredictable/quirky... Bitch like, unless your profile says you’re vegan I assume you like pizza, me too, the fuck, you aint special ok rant over"
"Went out on my first date with a guy and it went well.


Went to play some instruments and rocked out. I played the guitar and he played the drums. After that we went outside and made out. Then we drove to a hill and watched the sunset from the bed of my truck. I felt normal for the first time in years. Perfect date."
"UPDATE: Im very anxious about showing myself naked, (In public showers). Any tips?


So.. yesterday I posted about how I was going to the gym today for my first ever workout. In high school I always avoided the workout lessons so I could avoid showering with others with the fear of getting judged / scared of getting a random boner.

But... I did it ! I’m so happy! I went to the gym! I changed my cloth and went in and did my exercises. At 2 times during the session I wasn’t sure what machine / how to use it. So I asked 2 guys there for help (at 2 different times). I talked with them like I wasn’t socially anxious at all WTF. I mean.. I went down in like the super quite voice when I said “thank you so much” and nearly voice cracked. Awkward. But I did it all.

After the exercises I went to shower, right when I was gonna take of my cloth, 2 guys came in and sat like 1 meter from me so I got a bit nervous. But I told myself “just do it, they won’t care” cause u guys told me they won’t, and they didn’t. I took of my cloth went to the shower and did my thing and went back, and that was that. It was only me in the changing room when I got back so it was like a really “anti anxious zone”, I wish there was someone else in the shower tho so I could break the anxiety that I won’t get a boner while in the shower. Tbh I would probably avoid looking in the first place. It would be to scary to get caught looking! (+ isn’t it kinda disrespectful to look).

Then, 1 last thing. When I was waiting for the bus, 2 guys came up to me and asked what bus to take **in english** (I’m swedish). The cool thing with this is that I been scared talking in English but I did that too. Then I went home, to change my underwear haha cause I forgot to take a new pair.

I never sweated this much in my entire life. I’m definitely going there again (pref 3 times a week). Wow! Breaking an anxiety thing actually is the biggest hype rush.

Ok that was that, just wanted to give u guys an update and thanks for all the help!
Have a fabulous Friday :P

"Got caught sniffing underwear. Anyone else?


I’ve been seeing this guy for about 6 weeks. He gave me the key to his house so I could stay there all day this past Friday. Living room furniture was being delivered and they needed someone to be there; he was in clinicals all day. He’s new to this town so I was the obvious choice when asking. 

So here’s where it gets weird lmao. He has a pet snake. I’m kind of scared of snakes but wanted to impress him by handling it. I didn’t want the damn snake to bite me so I figured I would run his scent on my arm. I go to his laundry room, which is OF COURSE right across from the front door, and I pick up a shirt and rub it on my hand. Smelling my hand I realize it just smells like laundry detergent now. DAMNIT it smells clean. So I grab a pair of his underwear to see if this is a pile of clean clothes. The SECOND I put it up to my nose to take a whiff HE WALKS THROUGH HIS FRONT DOOR! They were dirty btw and smelt like pure man. I turned briiiiight red and tried to explain what I was doing, but he just kept laughing and calling me an underwear sniffing freak. I guess the good news is that he found it funny? 

He kissed my goodbye when I headed out towards the end of his lunch break. Well... I mean I initiated the kiss, but he kissed me back. So maybe miraculously I didn’t fuck it all up lmao."
"What's something a stranger did that instantly make you fall for them?


I commented this story on my previous post, but thought it deserved one of its own.

During summer camp with the boy scouts, I and another guy were assigned to keep watch during the night, while everyone else was sleeping. However, I was so tired that I accidentally fell asleep on his shoulder. Instead of waking me up immediately, he moved me on his lap, covered me up with his jacket and let me rest right until our shift ended. It was and, after all those years, still is one of the greatest acts of kindness done to me."
"Do you ever feel your homosexuality prevented you from being more open and trusting of people?


I know it did in my case because I was afraid of creating friendships to suddenly having to deal with the disappointment. I was more open when I was a kid and when I got to sixteen and began to realize who I was, I had a greater difficulty in building trust and connecting to new faces because what if they rejected me? What if I spent a great deal of time bonding and suddenly finding out the man or woman I'm confiding with happens to be anti-gay? It is complicated.

"My dick wants hookups, but my brain doesn't. Anyone else like this?


I'm a dude, I get horny, I go on grindr and talk to people. My body's super excited about the prospect of having sex, but then I get there and I just feel like I'm wasting my time? Like I dunno, sex isn't *that great*. I mean, I concede, maybe I just have bad sex, but I usually just find myself wanting it to be over, and I walk away thinking, ""great, I just risked getting an STI and/or a UTI for nothing."" 

And the whole anonymous thing with grindr is also unappealing to me; like I dunno. I want a guy who cares a little bit at least. Like this is so tiny, but I always try and wear cute underwear to hookups (things with fun patterns on them for instance) (I'm 21 okay fight me), and they never even notice. I wanna be fucking people who do (even if they're playfully mocking me).

So I go to these hook ups, always kinda regret them, delete grindr, and then, give it a week or two, I get horny again and repeat the process. Why do I do that? Does anyone else do that?"
"I just met someone on Grindr and it was amazing


I just wanted to share with you all how happy I feel right now. I went to my friend's town (which is like 20 min away from where I live) and I met this guy on Grindr. 
We started chatting and at the beginning I didn't think of it as something special. He looked handsome in the pics that he sent me and eventually I agreed to seeing him outside my friend's. 
He was very handsome and even taller that me (I'm  1.81 meters), we chatted for almost two hours and at the end we kissed. It felt amazing, so we kissed like three times. 
I feel very happy right now and just wanted to share this with you all. "
"Topped middle school ""friend"", he came out and told ppl he ""fucked my brains out""??


So when I was in 7th grade this guy would come in (he was in 8th) and like be our class mentor. Hes like the super masc frat type so I wouldn't consider him being gay. 2 weeks ago we connected on grindr and he was super nice so I went over and topped him. A couple days ago he came out as bi and hes telling people how I begged him to fuck me and how he ""fucked his brains out and left him shaking and begging"". I'm like super confused.... I don't get why he felt the need to say that. Do I do something? I went to an all boys school and I was basically the first out graduate, I don't care what our old classmates think of me but this is super weird."
