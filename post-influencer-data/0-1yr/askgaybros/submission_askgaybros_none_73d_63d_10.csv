"The hard work paid off! Gay Conversion Therapy books have been removed from Amazon!


So a couple of months ago I posted about a bunch of gay conversion therapy books that were listed on Amazon.

After talking to them on a weekly basis, and with the help of you guys and others it seems THE BOOKS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE UK AND US AMAZON STORE!!!  


I am so over the moon right now!!! This couldn't have been done without the help of everyone!!!  


So thank you to all those that have helped in whatever way they can!!!  


Full details about it here on my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ro.al.jo/posts/163463518024808)."
"I told my Muslim mother I’m gay and she said that I’m a “disgrace to humanity”


I said to her, “you married your first cousin, so don’t pretend like you’re not a disgrace to humanity yourself”"
"I'm a shy and anxious person, but yesterday I mustered up the courage to hand out 250 of rainbow enamel pins I designed to strangers at London Pride! Happy Pride from London!


My friends would probably never guess that I get really anxious in new social situations. I'd like to think that I mask it really well under an outgoing, bubbly persona. Honestly, I hit peak nervousness as I was preparing to leave my house for the parade, and was feeling so nauseous knowing that it was too late to give up now, having prepared the hundreds of my rainbow enamel pins on their backing cards with little handwritten notes on them. Knowing that I had to approach 250 people now seemed overwhelming, and I seriously doubted if I would get through them all by the end of the parade.

*250 pins to go.* I had to start somewhere. To get the momentum going I handed out a few to friends first and rehearsed my little shop's introduction. ""It's called *The Pin Prick*! Get it? The Pin (space) Prick?"" They rolled their eyes. Yes! That was exactly the reaction I wanted.

People must have seen my handing out the pins, and a few started coming up to me. I happily let them lucky-dip for pins from my (still very full) bag. They then told their friends, and their friends came round, and before I knew it 1/3 of the pins were given away! Woohoo!

*150 pins to go.* By this time, The Strangers had said some really nice things about my pin designs, and I was feeling good. My lucky-dip bag had only the rainbow-themed pins, and I had another bag of designs with specific pride colours (lesbian/bi/trans/pansexual/asexual/non-binary/genderqueer). My plan was to hand them out to anyone I saw representing their non-rainbow pride colours. I took to the street, weaving my way through the parade participants' holding area, hunting for anyone with specific pride flags/accessories. A trans flag! A bisexual lanyard! A genderqueer tee! One by one, approaching people became a little easier. Everyone was really nice! One by one, my bag became a little bit lighter. The majority of the pins were gone! (The asexuals were really hard to find, haha.)

*30 pins to go.* And it was time for me to join my organisation's float down the parade route. I initially wanted to hand my pins out to the parade participants only (they never get the free goodies!), but I decided to give the remaining ones to members of the public en-route. A lot of them ended up with my asexual-themed pins, heh.

*1 pin to go.* Wow, I handed out 249 pins! My last pin! And it was one with the pink lesbian pride colours. I was determined to find someone specifically flying the lesbian flag (and not just the rainbow), and give this last pin to them. The float was only halfway down Regent Street. Plenty of time to find someone. The end of Regent Street. So far all just rainbows. Piccadilly Circus. Make sure to look on both sides. Haymarket. Trafalgar Square. Uhoh, Whitehall's almost here. AND THEN... YES! A LONE PINK FLAG! Tied to the barrier, with a young teenager standing behind it. 

I ran up, shouting ""is this your flag? Is this your flag?""

""Yea!"" 

""This is for you!!""

""Oh my god thank you!""

*0 pins to go.* I DID IT!

Since the parade, some people have dropped by on Instagram to leave sweet thank you messages. Some even said that it my little interaction made their day, especially since I had pins that represented their personal pride colours. It felt really good, and made all the effort worthwhile.

London Pride 2019, I'll never forget you!

*If we met at the parade, don't be shy (ha!) to say hi! IG: @pinprick.shop / www.pinprick.shop HAPPY PRIDE from London!"
"my boyfriend is dropping his macho shit and it melts my heart


this might be cheesy as fuck but i love my mans soo much

my boyfriend is ‘straight-acting’ and although i don’t really agree with that term, it’s actually a label he likes. i think being gay makes him feel insecure in his identity as one of the lads. he’s very supportive of my outward femininity and campiness as others but can’t face his. 

i always knew this about him and it’s been a secret ambition to have him drop the macho facade sometime and let him be the small one. there’s no shame in wanting to be cared for, treated, cuddled or protected. i introduced him to skin care and bath bombs and bath robes but also being the little spoon and knowing we can always cry to me. oh and bottoming ;) 

just within the last month he’s dropped all the macho bullshit - he’s still very masculine but that’s in his nature, it’s just the false and toxic stuff i’ve seen dissipate. he explained to me the change in his behaviour like i didn’t already know. it’s really lovely him being real with me and letting me call him ‘baby’ or ‘baby boy’ (god, those were blacklisted for a long, long time)"
"Tom Holland announces he ""would be okay playing a gay Spider-Man""


Holland said, “The world isn’t as simple as a straight white guy. It doesn’t end there, and these films need to represent more than one type of person.”

No wonder everyone loves him. Read the article [here.](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/07/tom-holland-okay-playing-gay-spider-man-dont-hold-breath/)"
"Not all black guys have massive dicks...


Being on these hookup apps is depressing af. I get a lot of attention but I just wind up crawling into a hole anytime someone I'm interested in asks if I'm hung. It happens all the time.. Apparently that's the only criteria that needs to be met. It's left me feeling inadequate and a disappointment. I'm not even small 6.5-7x5.5 isn't too bad right?
  
There is this guy I have been hesitant about meeting up with for a few months. I felt he was way out of my league...but he would constantly message me nonstop, and I finally gave in and decided to meet up with him. We went for drinks, hung out. Texted me afterwards about how he thought I was extremely handsome and wished he had kissed me. Butterflies ensue and I invite him out. This time we kiss and fool around. I had work so we met another day and this time we go all the way.
  
Anyways...we got naked and I see the disappointment in his eyes. Things just fizzled after like 20 minutes because he didn't seem like he wanted to continue. I put my clothes back on and that was it.
  
I deleted all apps like 4 months ago and haven't had sex since.
  
Been feeling really lonely so I downloaded grindr and with 30 minutes I'm getting asked how big my dick is. 
  
I'm honestly peeved and not sure what to do. Guys in my area are just lame =/
  
Sorry..I just need to rant..."
"My mom passed away and I came out to her sister, my aunt.


It's been 3 years since my mother passed away. She died unexpectedly in a car crash and I never had the chance to come out to her as bi. Today I came out to her sister (my aunt) while eating at a restaurant and she took it so well. When my mother was still alive she and my aunt spoke about me possibly being into guys. My aunt always had a feeling, but my mom didn't think I was. My aunt told me that my mom said she didn't mind even if  I was.. and that was the most beautiful thing I heard. I couldn't hold back my tears and broke down crying and hugged my aunt. I'm so happy to hear she would've accepted me if she was alive."
"Seems like we're getting a lot less ""Ask Gay Bros"" and more ""Show Off/Praise me, Gay Bros""


For a decent advice/question/discussion forum, we seem to be delving into ""circle jerk me, daddy, I/my boyfriend/my SO did a thing."" And its just making this whole thing feel like some homosexual off shoot of ""r/AITA"" 

Can y'all quarantine your shit to a praise me gay bros subreddit or something? I like when people have good questions or need help, not just flooding the whole thing with cheap karma farms."
"As an American I refuse to celebrate July 4th...


Hello, 

I just need to rant here. 4 years ago I was fired from my job because of my sexuality. I lost all contact with 40 of my clients. I lost my home. Lost my college fund. Lost my savings. Got evicted. And had to sell a bunch of my stuff to stay afloat. We started a lawsuit and after 2 years of suing for retaliation, the judge threw t out because it “stemmed from an LGBT issue” and they’re not protected from discrimination in my state. Even though we didn’t sue on those grounds, the judge threw it out anyways... I attempted suicide that night. I’ve had nightmares, problems with self worth and getting close to people, and suffer from PTSD.

My dad fought for this country as a Green Beret and sacrificed a lot in his time serving. Unfortunately he died 9 years ago. But he often talked about how he felt betrayed by his country. And how he fought for ALL of our freedoms. 

So today, I don’t celebrate America. And since shit is going in a backwards direction, I almost resent it. I’m not bitter, but if my country won’t recognize me as an equal then I won’t recognize it as “Land of the Free”. 

BTW Vice once reported that black men to female trans people only have a life expectancy of 30 years old. So let’s celebrate America today, right?"
"Just got catfished


I was craving dick and was talking to this guy on Grindr last night and we made plans to meet up earlier this morning. He sent me a face pic and his name and I drove 20 minutes away to meet up with him and I’m waiting in the car and this guy who doesn’t look anything like the picture he sent comes up to me.

“You don’t look like the picture you sent me.”

“Oh so do you not want to do this?”

I said “Nah sorry. Have a good day.” and dipped out.

I was really annoyed, but more entertained that I actually just got catfished, but still, what a fucking scumbag.

Don’t be a dickhead and fall for catfishers like I did, and don’t be a fucking scumbag and catfish other people. I don’t know why people are so desperate to lie about themselves, but you can be better than that."
"Why are ""mean gays"" celebrated by gay culture?


I swear to God, if I had a dollar for every twink version of Regina George I've ever met. Usually, they're even more vicious than ""mean girls"" in their draggings, in fact I believe taking someone down with a catty, elaborate and maximally hurtful tirade has been perfected to an art form in that part of the gay community, I think much of it originates in ballroom/drag culture like most gay slang. In those spaces like seen in ""Drag Race"", ""Pose"" or even just stan twitter gays are at each other's throats and the one who wins with the biggest diss is met with praise, like I can hear someone yelling ""Yaaas read that heaux for filth!👏👏"" 😂  Why is it pretty much celebrated and respected by certain mean gays if you can hurt someone's feelings with your verbal ""lashings""?  Why pride yourself on being as mean as you can possibly be?"
"Making a guy more comfortable when he stays over.


Hello. A while ago I had a guy come over. He's super cute, really friendly, and he came over at last minute. I have been talking to him on Grindr a bit. After a few weeks of talking to him, I invited him to a Taco Party that my parents were throwing. He showed up. We went back to my place to talk and all. One thing led to another, he stayed quite a bit and left. Along with this, he even cut my hair (and I found out he's a hair stylist).

Since then he has come back several times. He's consistently texting me. He's always saying things like ""nobody makes me feel like you do."" ""I don't know what it is about you"" and other things like that. Hell the latest message form him  was a gem, ""Im in complete bliss when you touch me. My skin feelas if someone set it on fire then got thrown into the freezer after.""

I told him what is going on with my health. He's 100% supportive. He's aware that I need a heart transplant. It didn't scare him away at all. This honestly surprised me, because he is way more attractive then I am. Has beautiful tattoo sleeved arms.  

He's always forgetting something here. His shoes, his wife beater (consistently). When I texted him today with a photo of what he left. He responded ""I left it there so I have to come back."" I responded by telling him he can come back whenever he wants and doesn't have to leave anything. His response made me think, ""I wanted to leave my toothbrush. But I need it!""

I'm going in for surgery in a few hours (for another heart procedure, not the transplant). He's texting me a lot of supportive things right now. He asked if he can come over and stay the night when I get back from the hospital. It made me think.

Would it be awkward if I got him a toothbrush? I'm also thinking of getting him a phone charger. He always sleeps on the right side of the bed and has to borrow my phone charger. I already broke out a heavier blanket for the side he sleeps on. I don't know how when it is 80 degrees in the house he needs another blanket to stay warm.

Is there anything that would make you more comfortable when you stay over? This dude is the first one that keeps asking to stay over all the time. He sleeps the entire night and holds onto me a lot."
"Most of the women I’m close to told me it was “hot” when I told them I was gay and asked for stories. At this point, I realized I experience what lesbians go through. Any other Gay men deal with this when it comes to women?

"Found my little brother on Grindr, what to do?


Wanted to get everyone's insight. I am came out a few years ago, I am 33, and everything went smoothly for me. Entire family was accepting. 

I am never on the apps, as I hate them, and for the hell of it I decided to go on Grindr. Low and behold who do I come across on there? My lil brother who is 19, and as far as family is concerned he is straight. I have no idea what his friends know or don't know. So when I first came across it I freaked out. I also blocked him, because if he is trying to figure things out with his sexuality, I don't want him to have the added anxiety that his brother might have seen him on there. 

Anyway, I just don't know what to do with next steps. Part of me wants to approach him. Not so much to force him to come out, but moreso to protect him. I know how brutal the apps can get and at his age he is more vulnerable to the impacts of the behavior on the apps. I also want to be there and supportive for him and let him know he has me. I wish when I was 19 I could have someone that understood my plight. I just don't know what to do.

I was thinking maybe I would invite him out with some of my gay friends for a lunch or something, to maybe make him feel more comfortable that we can talk ""gay"" stuff. Perhaps make him feel more comfortable. Or I am not sure if I should take him out and approach him letting him know (gently) that I saw him on the app. 

I don't want to force him to come out to me, but at the same time I want to be there for him and be supportive, and in a way protect him from some of the unhealthy treatment and behavior in the community. Overall him and I have a very good relationship.  

The only person I told was my sister who I came out to, as I wanted to get her insight. I don't plan on telling anyone else. Possibly one or two of my gay best friends who I trust so we can take him out and make him feel more at ease. I feel the more support he has from other gay guys the better."
"Grindr hookup....


So I meet this guy on Grindr went over to his house I sucked him he breed 2 loads in my ass. I went home..... I started a new job on Monday and it turned out the guy who I got impregnated by was my new boss. Lol"
"The main 2 reasons why many of us are gonna be single is because we choose to be and/or because we set up very high standards for who we want to be with


If you’re single by choice, then I hope you’re happy and won’t regret this decision when you’re older, but if you’re actively seeking dates and not feeling lucky, then take a pause and think about your standards. Some of our standards are attainable, but they make the dating pool much smaller. Many want that handsome muscular guy who would please you in bed and make you feel confident in public. This is not unrealistic, but it excludes all the decent average-looking guys out there.

I’m not gonna pretend like I’m not guilty of this sometimes. By all means, everyone has the right to their preferences regardless of how ridiculous they are, but remember that the higher your standards are, the harder it’s gonna be to find the right person and settle down. Besides, studies already show that we’re becoming lone wolves, so we should expect that it’s gonna be more challenging out there."
"My twin brother seems to start hating me after I came out as gay weeks ago.


So I just discovered this subreddit and I hope this is the right place to ask for advice.
So I am 16 years old guy. Me and my twin used to be very close, we used to play a lot, talk a lot, In school we are always accelerating, we're really really close. Since I am 13, I already know that I'm gay. But I'm not that showy though, Me and my twin has a manly look, manly voice, masculine actions, we both have those typical masculine traits people see. When I used all the courage I have to come out last last week, my parents said that they don't have any problem in it which makes me happy since they're both Catholic. But my twin's reaction makes me confuse. He just nodded, never said anything and  just went outside. He never talked to me that entire day. I tried to ask him about his reaction towards me(especially that he's very religious), if anything changes but he just shaked his head. Last Saturday, I tried to ask him play Basketball with me. He refuses. He never say anything to me unless I initiate the conversation unlike those times before I came out. Then he was always gone for the entire day. Until now, that coldness is still present. I really hope that we can have that brotherly bond again, any advice what should I do about it? Should I keep asking him if he has any problem about it? Why does he seems to keep distance to me?"
"There’s nothing such as “the one”


As pessimistic as this might sound, it’s all about luck. Any person could be the one, any school could be the school and any job could be the job for a certain individual. That doesn’t mean you should give up on trying. Actually, that should motivate you to take more chances. Just start a chat with that guy or click “apply” for that job and see how lucky you might be. Of course there are some aspects that could make you more qualified than others to have better chances, but there is nothing such as “we’re meant for each other” or “I don’t know what I’d do without you”.

The reality is: You could’ve just walked past the very person that could’ve made you one of the happiest people alive, but you were too busy looking at your phone, or you could’ve applied to that job that 100s of people applied to and you felt like you stood no chance because you had no experience, but the employer could’ve hired you since your character would’ve stood out and you would’ve enjoyed working there.

It’s all about luck and taking chances in life, but don’t think that what you have now is only meant for you. It’s all about taking the chance at the right time and in the right place."
"I don't fit in


This just hit me yesterday. I'm gay, but I've no gay friends to talk to. Girls won't talk to me because they think I'm straight and talking to straight guys is too scary for me. I'm neither ugly or good looking. I'm not boring but I'm also not interesting. I'm not sad but I'm also not happy.  
  
These things actually make me feel like so lonely and make me feel useless. Is anyone else feeling like this? What do you do in these type of situations? It feels so horrible being worthless sometimes."
"The amount of misinformation and fearmongering about HIV on this sub is astounding. Educate yourselves!


I see people coming on here pulling their hair out over a blowjob or a 30 second anal encounter with a condom, and others egging on their baseless anxieties telling them to go get on PEP immediately or whatever.

Stop it! Here's some fast facts for you ignorant bitches:

* The risk for oral is so unbelievably low they can't even put a number on it.

* Given that the vast majority of new transmissions come from people who don't know they're positive, you're actually more likely to get hiv from someone who tells you they're negative. The only way you can be sure they are neg is if you could somehow verify that they had no sexual encounters since the beginning of the window period of their last test. 

* UNDETECTABLE = UNTRANSMISSIBLE. Period. There is literally zero chance of catching hiv from someone who is UD. Two massive studies each involving thousands of serodifferent couples and hundreds of thousands of exposures found NO instances in which an undetectable person transmitted the virus. Viral ""blips"" sometimes occur, but again, there are no documented transmissions as a result of a blip. Treatment failure is exceedingly rare.
