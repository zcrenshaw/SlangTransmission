"My husband is making me feel like garbage for wanting to go back to work [


I am 29f, husband is 28m.

We just recently had our first child and I'm on maternity leave. I'm not enjoying it at all. It's not that I don't like being around my kid, but it's been 2 months with barely any adult contact aside from my husband and a few mom groups where everyone just talks about their kids. I want to interact with more adults.

My maternity leave technically lasts all year, but I will absolutely not make it that long. My husband made me feel shitty when I floated the idea of going back to work. All of the sudden he's saying I probably have ppd because ""any healthy mom would kill to spend this time bonding with her baby.""

I'm so upset about it. It's not a financial issue as I can easily pay for day care with my salary. I told him he can stay home and I'll be the bread winner since we make pretty much the same amount and he told me it's not that he thinks someone needs to be home with the baby but that he thinks there's something wrong with me as a mom for not wanting to stay home. I feel terrible and it's hurting me deeply but when I try to talk about it he just tells me I need to go to the doctor and get checked for ppd. Am I being crazy here? I'm so hurt by what's happening.

Tl;dr I want to go back to work and my husband says I have ppd all of the sudden

"[Update] Me [F, 22] &amp; a friend [F, 23]: her party clashes with my social anxiety


Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aisxw7/me_f_22_a_friend_f_23_her_party_clashes_with_my/


Hey everyone, i want to make a little update regarding my last post! 

Firstly, I am super grateful for this sub, you guys helped me pull a switch in my brain and make a right decision. At that moment, it was upsetting to see everyone tell me how wrong i was, when i guess i came here to validate my decisions... But sometimes the best advice is not the one you want to hear rn.

My friend's bday dinner happened yesterday, and i did go! I talked to my therapist (because i am, indeed, in therapy for my anxiety), and she encouraged me to go as well. I was super scared, especially about not being able to get in the group convo and being left out..but it went alright! It was pretty nerve-wracking for sure because i had to literally make myself be active in the conversation (it's hard because i normally think no one cares about what i have to say!) but my therapist really recommended to try. I initiated some convos with my friend's bf (as i knew him more than the girls) and at first i talked mostly to him but my friend would ask my opinion on things her girlfriends were talking about so in the end we all ended up in a one big convo, i managed not to be on a verge of a panic attack all the time and participated in discussions! My friend said she was glad i've made it :)

I feel silly but i'm super proud of myself because i didn't think i could force myself to put myself in a potentially uncomfortable situation &amp; but it happened and i'm really thankful you guys!!

TL;DR: Went to the dinner, tried my best to be talkative, seems like it all went fine!"
"Crazy ex-MIL [60s/F] got a job at my [25/F] office. Cannot afford to quit, but not sure what to do. She hinted that calling my ex-fiance [35/M] would cause her to back-off.


When I was 17 I met this really hot older guy who seemed to be everything I’d ever need. By 18 I was engaged to “Todd” who was 28. I thought he was a debonair older guy. He was so slick and charming. He asked me to marry him on Valentine’s day after 4 months of dating. It was so romantic that I said yes. We didn’t even last the rest of the year. He was incredibly lazy, perpetually getting fired from work for showing-up stoned. He didn’t clean, cook, or look after himself. He expected that I was ready for sex at any moment and could never say no to anything he wanted to try. He was living with me in my student apartment and paid no rent. I would come home from classes and my part-time job at around 7 and would need to make him food. Then I would need to clean the apartment after all the messes. Then listen to him complain about how mean everyone was. Then I would need to satisfy his needs. Then he’d play video games until 3:30AM and then fall asleep around 4. He’d sleep through his alarm (thus getting himself fired again) and I would need to then clean-up that mess. His mother is certifiable. She’s not only mean, but violent and pushy. She would try and get involved in our sex life. She wanted a detailed background on my family and tried to get a criminal background check on me. She called the police on me when I didn’t respond to a text after 15 minutes and when I dumped her son she tried to take me to court claiming I had “stolen” things. I had stolen nothing and luckily wasn’t forced to pay. I cut both of them out of my life and have been successfully living without them for the last 7 years. 

For the last 5-ish months, I have been seeing a new guy. He’s the opposite of Todd in every single way imaginable. “Ben” is such a nice guy; he’s incredibly hardworking, smart, and talented. He’s in a graduate program, has a part-time job and volunteers some of his time. We have a great thing going on together and the last 5 months have been stupendous. Anyway, here’s where the problem starts.

About a month ago, a colleague of mine left for another job. I work in a role where I don’t directly report to that person, but I work with them. They couldn’t find anyone to take the position and finally opened the search up a bit more. They hired someone with loads of “transferable” skills and said it’s on a 2-year contract. Then they sent-around a welcome email and my jaw hit the floor when I saw the name. I immediately started panicking and went to my boss. I explained everything but he said that there was nothing he could do as she doesn’t report to him. I went to HR who told me it was none of my business. 

She saw me from across the cubicle and could hardly hide her contempt. She walked over and said “so, I hear you work here. Well… we’ll see…” and walked away. My boss reassured me that he wouldn’t let anything happen to me. It’s been two weeks and total hell. She’s made me fetch her coffee, and trashed my work. She trashes me when no one is around. She insults my attire and my performance and my desk cleanliness. I went to HR who basically said this was a personal problem. She then said she’d “let up… and… you know… Todd is still waiting for your call…” She’s basically said that if I call Todd (get back with him) she’ll stop making my life hell. She has no idea I’m in a relationship. 

Friday was awful. She was on me all day and insisted that she sit at my desk to “train me” to do something that she doesn’t know how to do. She is back at it today. I went home and cried Friday to Ben for hours. He point-blank told me to quit that I could live with him and could look for another job. He told me he didn’t mind supporting me. We’ve talked about moving in together – my lease is up in a few months and we were going to talk about moving in together this summer. I feel like calling him, asking him if the offer is still valid and walking into HR and quitting. I can’t take it. She’s eating her lunch at my desk, she won’t leave me alone. She keeps talking about how great Todd is – he is on disability now after a “fall” and is looking to get back into dating. She won’t stop with prodding about our breakup in between bouts of insulting me. Today she threw away my lunch because ""she thought it was garbage"" and poured my tea away because she ""thought it was stale coffee."" She's told me what a huge mistake I've made and ""Todd sits there waiting...."" and will make references to people who need to ""make things right."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at my wit's end. I want out. I can't take it. Is it fair to dump this on a newish BF or can I just take him at his word and get the hell out of here?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr ex-MIL got a job at my work and is making my life hell. New BF is offering me the opportunity to quit and live with him while I look. I need to get out of here. It's intolerable. Is it fair to quit and move in with him?"
"Intercultural/Interracial Relationship - Need Advice


I am a long-time reddit reader but have never posted before. I am needing some relationship advice in an intercultural/interracial relationship.

I am an American girl (30) who has been dating a Muslim Pakistani guy (28) for the past year. He comes from a pretty straight orthodox family. Most of his family is back in Pakistan in a medium-sized city, including his parents. He has not seen his parents in over 7 years, and he will be going back in about a month to see them. He recently told them that he would like to get married to me in the near future. They got very upset with him, as the expectation is that he does an arrange marriage to a Pakistani girl where the his parents will help him find a match. His father has not spoken to him for several months. His mom speaks with him, but is very emotional and does not accept this as the right thing to do. They view it as he is ""dishonoring"" his family, and if he continues through with this they will ""disown him"". He is going back home to smooth things over and get rid of any concerns that they have. Who knows if they will come around this trip. 

I firmly believe that he is the one, and that we belong together. I am not interested in spending my life with anyone else. He recently told me that he does not see himself living in America longer than the next 5-10 years, and will want to move back home to be closer to his family and to raise his kids away from Western culture. He would want to move to a big city where there are plenty of expats and where it is safe. I have lived overseas before, and I do not have a problem with this. We are both very patient people, and I am very interested in their religion and will probably convert. I have also been learning their language and learning about the culture. My friends think that I am crazy and that I should never consider moving to a country like that. However, I think there are a lot of misperceptions about his country and I don't think that it is any less safe there than America. 

Is it worth it to continue this relationship, despite our cultural differences and being from two different places? I truly believe that this was meant to be and there is a reason that God brought us together. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** **American girl dating Pakistani guy, parents not accepting our relationship, my boyfriend will eventually want to move back home and expects that I will come with him.**"
"My girlfriend (F18) is jealous of my (18M) success in College Track.


Im in a very weird situation. For background, my girlfriend and I have been dating since junior year of high-school. We met at a track meet and it has been a pretty integral part of both of our lives. She is a 4 time state champion and I am a 1 time. So she was much better than me (we run the same event).

Now, we are freshman in college both running NCAA D1 and she is on scholarship and I am not. I came into college with very low expectations placed on me and now I have shattered ceilings that I didn’t know existed. I am currently one of the best on the team overall and I have brought my times down by 12s and 39s in the events I do. Now, she hasn’t run a personal best yet and is a strong runner, but she is used to being the best.

This has been weighing on her heavily as far as I could tell. She is much more anxious before races. She doesn’t like when I talk about my successes or the invitationals that I run at. 

I really just want to know how I can reassure her. I want her to know that she is still a great runner and she shouldn’t be comparing her successes to mine because we are both great in different aspects. 

TL:DR - I became good at track over night and now my girlfriend compares her success to mine and it’s causing some strain."
"My (33f) fairytale with him (33m) has turned into a bit of a horror story.


What can I do here? I moved in with my boyfriend last year (after dating for several years). I have a 7 year old daughter with me and he has a 10 year old daughter with him. They get on quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

He had a well-paying job and was also starting a side business. I worked retail (for much less than he makes). When we moved in together he convinced me to quit my job which drained my energy and he said was really a waste of time for what I was paid. He instead suggested I should work with him to help get his side business off the ground. This sounded good.

&amp;#x200B;

However, soon after we moved in together, he unexpectedly lost his main job. This has of course put considerable strain on our lives.  So now we are in a rush to get the side business running. However, it's quite difficult and for the most part it's not stuff I know how to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I do my best to keep our household running well. I take the girls to and from school and skating and playdates. I grocery shop and do our laundry and look after pets. Prepare dinners. Do lots of errands, go to the post office, bank, etc. I take his dad to doctor appointments as necessary. I sit up with him sometimes half the night to keep him company and fetch things. I don't know HOW to do the actual hands-on work and he gives me very little direction.

&amp;#x200B;

But he's under a LOT of stress and pressure because he feels like our future rests on his shoulders. Even if I get another retail position it won't pay for our house, etc.  He also is probably feeling horrible for losing his job (even though it wasn't actually his fault).

&amp;#x200B;

**Here comes the fun part:**  he turns his stress and anger towards me regularly.  It's so upsetting to me because I never know when I'm going to ""get in trouble"" next. And of course I'd do whatever I could to avoid these fits of his, but I never know what's going to set him off. Sometimes he's great. Happy and positive and singing a happy tune. Other times he's a nasty, bitter, angry monster.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll give a super quick example. Last night I sat up with him until 3am then went to bed. I then got up early and made lunch for the girls and took them to school. Came home and did laundry. Went to the bank. Made a dental appointment for him. Picked up the mail at the post office. I did not wake him up because (1) he hadn't asked me to, and (2) I know he was up until 4 am so I figured he wanted to sleep.  I heard him wake up around 2 pm so I made him coffee, soup and a sandwich and came up to give it to him.

&amp;#x200B;

The minute I walked in he was a snarling mess. Blaming me for letting him sleep. Blaming me for the fact that ""nothing gets done"" (even though he alone is the one who needs to do the stuff). When I told him what I'd been doing he dismissed it and said I'm just wasting time. He then grabbed the coffee and threw it against the bed (nothing broke but it spilled everywhere).  He said he needs help and I'm absolutely no help.  I walked out and went downstairs and started doing the dishes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know he'll apologize later. But this isn't an isolated incident. It's a regular occurrence now and it's really making me feel shitty. Last month we got into an argument and he ripped up the birthday card I gave him. He was really angry at me at Christmas and ripped decorations off the tree.  He has thrown a muffin, a hamburger and an (nearly empty) can of pop over the past few months.  There's so much stress in my home now, and since he is always here without a job, I feel at the mercy of his moods.  I believe in loving someone you've committed to even if they are sick. I wouldn't leave him if he had cancer. But I don't know if this is mental illness from the stress of losing his job or just abusive nastiness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr: boyfriend lost his job and is stressed and now becoming a tyrant at home**"
"Am I [f36] walking into married creep’s Valentine’s plot?!


So, I’m a freelancer and I’ve been asked to schedule a meeting with a potential client who works in different sector. 

I definitely got the vibe that this guy has a bit of a thing for me for the last few months and I’m not interested - he’s also married, and 99% certain he messes around on his wife (he told me directly, but I guess he could be lying about that just to gauge interest) - although I think that’s gross, it’s none of my business to judge. 

Because I DO specialise in services for the sector he works in when he texted and asked for a meeting about a project I’m really well suited for, I was like yeah sure whatever. He asked for a lunch meeting this week and asked what I could eat, and I suggested Japanese. He asked me to email on some biz stuff (case studies etc) &amp; wrote back the name of a hotel and I was like sure whatever. Didn’t think of it for hours as have been busy on other things. 

I have a physical calendar as well as iCal (I know, I’m like a grandma, but it helps me to have things written down) was putting in some stuff and so added this meeting. That’s when I realised IT’S ON VALENTINES GODDAMN DAY. IN A HOTEL. 

I’m confident that I can handle this meeting and am in not at risk of being scooped into a hotel room (although now that I’ve said that you guys are my witnesses).  Also there is a chance the Japanese place at the hotel is one of the better restaurants in the area, the proximity of the hotel to his work may be a factor, as it’s a bit of an isolated spot except for super busy tourist things I wouldn’t go to ever, and which wouldn’t be appropriate for a business meeting anyway. If it were _anyone else_ on _any other day,_ I probably wouldn’t even notice or care (I often set up meetings at hotel just because it means I can park up and use the WiFi in case they’re late, and the venues are usually easy to find bc they’re all in Maps). 

IS DUDE TRYING TO CREEPENTINE ME? 

Is that even a thing? I don’t know bc I don’t really care about Valentine’s ever, and also that seems insane. He’s married and has kids and I’ve not shown any interest other than professional.

Hot takes? 

TL;DR Advice please - Is Married man trying to get me to have a Business Meeting on Valentines Day - or a “BUSINESS” meeting? "
"If someone liked you, would you want to know?


Someone I know (32 M) is in a fairly toxic long term relationship (7 years) with his gf (26 F). Lots of issues around finances, lack of respect for each other etc. He has very subtly expressed some romantic interest in another woman (26 F) from our friend group. 


Nothing has ever happened between them, but they are close friends and have worked together for over a year. 


She feels like he cares deeply about her, and once he even asked her if she thought they could ever be together. She said no, and made a bunch of excuses as to why because she was freaked out that they worked together and he was in a relationship. 



This friend told me she has been thinking about letting him know she has feelings for him and that she regrets responding the way she did to his question, despite the fact that he is in a relationship. She said that she feels like he is trapped in his relationship and that maybe things could change if she were honest with him.



If you were him, would you want to know? Would it change anything, or would it just cause unnecessary pain to all parties? 



TL;DR My friend wants to tell a guy that she likes him, but he’s trapped in a toxic relationship.

"I (21F) believe my mind is ruining my relationship


I've been dating my bf (23M) for about 3 months now. It's been amazing and I think he could really be the one.
But now things are starting that I've had happen in every prior relationship. 
Whenever things are going well, I feel like I'm looking for something wrong. 

This weekend I went to his house for the first time to visit his parents (I already knew them before but it was my first time at the house) and I couldn't get his past relationship out of my mind. Wherever I went I saw them together (in my imagination obviously). In his bedroom, when we went to meet his best friends for the first time, etc. I never even met the girl and he only ever tells me about her when I specifically ask, so I don't actually need to be worried about anything. But still I can't seem to stop getting him out of my head with his old girlfriend. I have this terrible voice telling me that I will never be good enough and he was much happier before. For some reason I even believe his friends and family feel the same way about me, even though I've been told they really don't.

 I'm terrified he will leave me and I have a feeling I'm making myself unhappy where I really shouldn't be. My mind is playing tricks on me.

He really is the sweetest most caring man I have ever met. We want all the same things in life and he supports me in all my endeavours. I don't understand what is going on with me and I am so afraid to ruin this relationship with my unnecessary fears.


Tl;Dr my mind is leading me to ruin the most perfect relationship I have ever had. I can't stop seeing him with his ex.  Please help! "
"BF forces me to give him massages, I have NO choice


Hi,

I (F, 20) have been in a relationship with this guy (M, 22) for 4.5 years now. He has always loved back massages, where I sit on his back and massage him. However, this love for massages has slightly lost control.

I don't particularly like giving massages (in fact, I hate them so much), but I do it because I know he likes it and I want to put effort in for him. I'm not with him during the week (I'm away for uni Monday to Friday afternoon), so I am with him on Friday evenings, Saturdays, Sundays, and Monday Mornings. I always give him massages once or twice that weekend and if I even slightly refuse, he tends to get mad. So to avoid conflict I do it again anyway.

When I say no, he starts nagging and saying that I'm supposed to do this for him and that he puts so much effort into me because I'm a difficult person and that I know that he loves it so much so ""why can't you just..."".

I have been sick this past weekend (with the flu) and yesterday he forced me to massage him again. I found it strange and told him that and said I didn't want to. But of course... I ended up doing it again, while coughing and sweating and everything. 

Today (still sick) he came over to my house again to watch a movie and sleep over. The movie didn't load well so of course, he asked me to massage him again. I had given him two long massages that weekend, and as I'm still sick, I said I didn't want to. And this time, I was going to stick to it. He did what I expected: he started nagging at first, saying ""please please I need this and this is what you do for each other... Etc etc"". I said ""I'm still sick and I have given you two long massages this weekend, I don't want to"". He kept that up for 15(!) minutes and started to pick a fight, saying that I was a horrible person and he had to do so much for me and that I was the one ruining the whole night. I told him to just stop worrying about the massage and watch a movie with me, but he kept on fighting and started yelling at me that I was a terrible girlfriend for not giving him that massage. I told him I never ever say no, and now I'm sick, so lay off me. But then he said that he had the right to ""force me"" (???). I stuck to my word, he put on his shoes and left angrily. 

I'm alone in my room right now, and I'm going back to uni tomorrow for a few days. What do I do now???

TL;DR my boyfriend forces me to give him back massages even when I'm sick, and when I even try to refuse he gets really angry, insults me, and leaves. "
"Is there any way to repair my [20F] sort of relationship with a guy [20M] after losing almost all of his trust?


I'm in such a difficult situation right now.

I had been dating (yet not officially or exclusively) this guy who I really liked for about four months. We never had an exclusivity talk (although I tried twice- he said he wanted to take things slow and only said that he got logged out of tinder after not using it for a bit but never said that he wanted neither of us to see other people). I was superliked by a guy who goes to his college (we don't go to the same one), I responded to his message out of curiosity, we ended up texting, and the conversation was completely benign and friendly- no flirting, intention to hook up, date, nothing.

I didn't tell the guy I had been dating because I really didn't think it was a big deal- he ended up finding out from a friend at college (extremely small school) and is extremely upset and said he lost almost all of his trust for me and that he misinterpreted what things were between us. I apologized incessantly and was honest as humanly possible, I did and said everything I could.

He told me it's been really shitty for him because people have been talking about how ""I was talking to another guy from his school on Tinder"" at school.

We've talked for a few hours on the phone and he said that while he did like me, he now isn't sure that he wants to go through building trust back up for me and he basically said he's done right now. 

I panicked and told him I felt like we had 3 options- either to cut things off, to work on things, or to take a set break/space and then revisit in a bit. He said his phone was dying and if those were the only 3 options he was getting then we should just cut things off.

I told him I didn't want to make him make a hasty decision especially because he's still extremely upset and it's only been less than a week since this all happened, and I told him to text me today if that's still the case and he wants to still cut things off.

I haven't heard from him but I did text him and apologize for demanding a final answer in a time where he's still upset. He read it but didn't respond. 

Does it sound like there's anything I can do to fix this? I have such a hard time with things like these. I also don't know what the best thing for me to do in this situation is. 


**TL;DR:** really want to fix things with a guy I really like after I made a pretty big mistake but I don't know if I can. "
"I (20F) am not sure if I should join the air force due to my current relationship


I've been considering joining the military for about 2 years now but since my financial aid recently changed,I have been seriously considering enlisting. I would 100% enlist right now, but the only thing stopping me is my current relationship. I have been dating my bf (28m) for only about 3 months now, but I *really* like him and would be crushed if I had to stop seeing him. Right now we only see each other a couple times a week due to an hour distance, so I am sure that me leaving even further would mean we would have to end things. The thought makes me nauseous, but this is something I want to pursue. So is it ridiculous to let a 3 month relationship get in the way of my future? Should I give my decision even more time, or go ahead and bring this up? 

Tl;dr I would really like to enlist in the air force, but I really don't want to end my current relationship.

"I [20M] broke up with my girlfriend [22F] of four years. Looking for advice going forward.


We are both severely depressed, and it's gotten to the point that I've lost all faith in myself. I made the judgement that since I don't know what to do for myself, I don't know what I can do for her, so I told her I want to try going at it on my own. But I am terribly unsure of myself. I have to convince myself constantly that I am making the right decision and it has to be this way, but I still don't even know what life looks like going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The past six or seven months especially have been very tough. I had to make some very tough decisions in dropping certain courses (I'm supposed to graduate this semester), and she is not taking courses at all this semester (along with being unemployed). We both had a lot of time on our hands and spent the days at home, doing nothing, feeling terrible. Every once in awhile one of us had a decent day and we would try to motivate the other, but it feels like a drain pulling us down into its whirpool and I don't want to drag her down with me. Additionally, since I'm graduating, I have to figure out what my professional world will look like, which I've been preparing for (part of the stress I'm under), but my mental health has worn out any form of self-confidence I had, so now I'm always unsure of myself and what I'm doing, which makes me feel guilty, as well, constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my loose plan is to leave the house we're living in together with the cat she surprised me with two years ago, and move in with my parents for four or five months. I have multiple friends whose leases are expiring around June/July, and we may look for new places together, or I may move into where they are now. At the moment, I'm staying in the house we shared still, because I don't feel comfortable leaving my cat there. He is the main problem in resolving this break/break-up, because he's a really good cat and we both love him. I feel like if I leave him there, it's abandonment, even if I get it in writing that I get him after the lease expires (March). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've sought counseling, but it doesn't start for another week and a half. I don't know what to do with myself, it's not like I can just stop being depressed, or put myself out there. In my mind, putting myself out there is like putting nothing out, because I have no idea what my qualities are. I don't know what I like about myself, or what issues I'm able to tackle. Everything feels like a question mark and I don't have any answers. Sorry if this post doesn't fit this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: newly single, depressed, don't want to lose my cat, and I don't know what to do with myself. "
"My girl (F21) ""probably"" slept with my (M25) best mate (M24). But also I might just be crazy.


So it's pretty simple. I didn't go out and party with them one weekend and they all went out drinking, but my best mate didn't mention he was going to the same place as my girl (they're friends). Whatever, no biggie.

I called my mate to ask if he needed a ride home from the club he was at and he didn't pick up. But I got onto him over messages and he was responding really weird, like I asked him where he was (didnt know they were together at this point) and he would just change the subject.

Anyway, my girl was supposed to start work at like 5am and she didnt show up, so I messaged her and checked where she was at on snapmaps and she wasnt at home. She coulda been at her girls house though, allg.

And then in the morning, my mate asks for a ride (is invisible on snap maps) and hes at the address she was at last night. And as soon as I start driving to go and get my mate. She heads home on snapmaps. 
So I get there and ask him about it and he says he didnt even see her at that house, because there was heaps of rooms.

It all just doesnt sit right with me, but I have a tendancy to overthink things. Am I crazy or is this dodgey asf

Also I havent mentioned any of this to her yet, but how should I approach her?

TL;DR: My girl and my best mate stayed at the same place after a night out at the club and they both were being a little weird about it. Maybe I'm crazy tho idk."

For context, we've been dating for \~2 years, living together for 1.

She tells me on a regular basis how much she absolutely despises her job and her coworkers. She has no friends to vent to, and her family only offers limited support. She's upset with her body as she has gained a bit of weight over the past several months. She wants to start working out and get on a better sleep schedule, but it seems like there are constant impediments that hinder these goals.

Meanwhile I'm pretty content with my job, I have great friends, a lot of hobbies I switch between, and feel pretty happy about life in general.

I always offer my support on whatever she wants to do, I help out wherever and whenever I can. I'm encouraging and try to highlight the positives in our lives whenever possible. I tell her she's beautiful (and she is) all the time and I've put a lot of work into ensuring we both have lots of fruits and veggies in our diets and try to cook very health conscious meals. I agreed to get a kitten a few months ago because she's wanted a pet for ages now (and he's the fucking best). I try to always include her with my friends.

Despite all this, it seems like all she can focus on is the doom and gloom, always getting overly stressed and upset about things that are either beyond her control or not feasible to be fixed at the current time. It's wearing on me more and more as time goes on, I find myself starting to lose patience. I've tried hinting maybe it might be time to talk to a professional, but she seems convinced that wouldn't help anything, probably because she's a social worker with a major in psychology.

I know the obvious answer is to be supportive and be there for her, but I've been doing that for what seems like an eternity now. Sitting back and watching her be miserable is affecting me greatly, and I want to do more to help.

What do I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Girlfriend is depressed/frustrated most of the time. It's wearing on me and I want to help more than just standing by and being supportive."
"Can't decide if I (24F) should tough it out to stay with my long distance, closeted gf (23F)


My gf and I have been together for 3.5 years all of it long distance. When we first got together, I was absolutely smitten. She was everything that I thought I wanted: smart, pretty, from a good family, common interests, goals, etc. 

When we started dating, we were both in undergrad a few hours away. I graduated first, moved home for a job (still about the same distance) and we continued on. She then graduated and selected a pharmacy school 8 hours away from my home town. This was expected, as she's from an area near the school, but I was still disappointed. I knew I wouldn't be able to make an 8 hour LDR work for 4 years while she was in school. I was ready for a career change at the time as well, so I started looking for jobs to close the gap. Because her school is in a smaller town (around 100k), I knew moving there wouldn't be a good fit for me career wise. I interviewed and received a job offer about 2.5 hours from her pharmacy school in a major city and thought this would be an excellent compromise. 

This was about 1.5 years ago. Since then, things have kind of slowed. The initial plan was for her to move to my city after 2 years (there's a campus in my city, but you can't select that as your ""home"" campus right out of undergrad). Anyway, her application got rejected as the few slots available are usually reserved for married couples who were doing long distance. This kind of made something click in my head that I'm looking at 2.5 more years of long distance. 

Things have become kind of a ""chore"" for me. Because my schedule is more consistent, we work around her school schedule primarily. This gets exhausting for me as things are always on her time. In addition, travelling to her has become more of a pain. We don't do anything fun because shes always studying or wants to relax and do nothing in her downtime. I'm giving up weekends with my friends or to do my own thing to go to her house and be bored. We can't take any trips together because she's always got school requirements. I just feel like I'm giving up my fun 20s for something that might not actually pan out. 

Something that is also very important is that she is totally in the closet. Her ex, who she doesn't speak to anymore, is the only person who knows about our relationship. I made her a new years resolution to tell 3 of her friends, but I feel guilty about that. In my opinion, she needs to be confident enough to come out for herself, not come out because I made her. I don't want to force her to do something that I'm not even sure will fix our relationship. All of that to say that this makes me feel like our relationship isn't real. We've been together for years, but because of the closet and distance, it's like it's nonexistent. 

I guess it's also worth noting that because I'm gay, the dating pool is smaller in general. It's even smaller for me because I'm a very traditional person, not really fitting the common lesbian ""scene"". That's what is creating so much hesitation. She's a great person who I love deeply, but I just don't know if this is practical. 

This turned out to be more of a vent, but any advice would be appreciated. 

TLDR: Unsure if long distance, closeted gf is the one anymore despite being a great ""on paper"" match. "
"How to respond to girl who took 24hrs to reply?


I (22M) texted this girl (22F) that I’m into yesterday that I had to cancel our date due to a funeral (legitimate) and asked her if we could reschedule for Wednesday instead. She replied just a couple minutes later saying she was sorry and then asked what time on Wednesday? I replied a few minutes later suggesting the time as a response to her question and it took her 24hrs to reply to that. She agreed to the time I suggested, but yet it took her a day later and then said ‘sorry I’m just now replying’ with a 😂 face. 

Her friends seem to say this is pretty standard with her, even for them, so I don’t think much about it, but how should I respond? Say something clever like ‘I was getting worried about you!’ Or just reply by 
saying ‘See you then!’

TLDR, this girl took 24hrs to reply to my text."
"I (28F) broke up with my boyfriend (29M) of 2 years and I hope it sticks this time. Any advice on how to not go crawling back when you’re heart broken?


I have been in a relationship for the past two years with an incredibly attractive, intelligent man who is also a giant ass hole and treated me kind of horribly the whole time. I know I really need to move on from this relationship because so many things have come into light the last few days, and I know I need to start putting all of my energy into myself rather than wasting it on him. I gave way too much and got way too little in return so I slowly started to fade away, holding onto the hope that things would get better. Hoping he would realize how he was taking me for granted and make it right. Reading that now, it’s the silliest thing I’ve every thought. The relationship was so bad for me and brought out the worst in me so I know I need to be done with it for good this time. The problem is that my heart hurts so much, all want to do is be in his arms because it always felt so nice. 

I moved to another state for him and am so broke. I don’t really know what I’m going to do at this point, I can’t afford to rent a room on my own. I want to go back to my home state to be with my family and best friend but don’t want to lose my job here because I feel like I really belong with this company. I can go through the process to transfer to the other state but  it would take 6 months. I’m seriously contemplating living in my car until I can transfer. This is all so overwhelming for me and makes me want to go back to him so I need help. I know a lot of people have been here and got through it, I need your advice. How do I not go back to my toxic relationship when my heart is broken and all I want is for him to hold me? 

TLDR: I need advice on how to avoid putting myself back into a toxic relationship because I miss him, and I’m heartbroken. "
"I [32/M] need help breaking up [29/F] for the first time in my life.


I've been dumped before, oh so many times. And it hurts. But I have never been the one initiating the break-up. This is completely new for me. I've been single for many years, mainly because of moving a lot.

Now i'm back in the city I want to spend the rest of my life in, and pretty much straight away when I moved here, I met this girl. I thought the stars aligned for me and I was over the moon. 

We started hanging out and it was great at first. When we first met i couldn't leave, I felt drawn to her. Eventually I left but I came back just one day after. Eventually I started to announce to people that I was dating somebody and that it felt great. People were happy for me, because they know I have wanted this for so long.

This woman is so kind, she is a pure soul. She is so considerate, she really cares for me. If I could control my brain I would make it fall for her. But I can't...

Over time it became apperant that we don't have that much in common. I tried to fight this at first, tried to find a middle ground, but there was none to be found. 

Eventually I realized that ""I don't have any feelings."" it was nice to hang out with her but I wasn't drawn to her anymore. And now I have made this painful realization that I have to break up with her. Not only does she deserve somebody that is more in to her than I am, but, this is where I am struggeling.

This is completely new for me. She is still very much in to me. She texts me that she misses me, looks forward to when we will meet again and ... yepp, now I am crying as I write this. The thought of her being home alone sad in her apartment missing me breaks my heart. I know it's not a reason to stay, and that she will recover, but taking this final step feels like putting my hand on the hot stove. I know it will hurt like hell, but I also know that I can't drag this out either since my mind is made up. 

**TLDR** any advice for how to break up? How do I do it? What do I say? "
"My [F18] coworker [F19] won't stop flirting with me, despite me telling the to, and I am super uncomfortable.


Hello!

So me and Rachel became friends in our last year in high school. Not close at all really, but close enough that we would be friendly in class. 

She got me the job at the place she worked, a drug store.

Rachel was dating my best friend, Tom at the time. But they broke up. I am an open lesbian, and Rachel confided in me that she was bisexual. I helped her through this and talked to her about it, having been in a situation like that before. 

It was during this time that she started flirting with me, and I was just friendly for a while not reciprocating but also not shutting it down. 

1. She is my best friend's ex

2. I'm not attracted to her 

I eventually told her I'm not into her that way, and she went to school in a different state. I thought this would be the end of it.

She came back.

She now has started back up with the insane amount of flirting. Calling me her girlfriend, saying I'm cute, saying she's going to buy me romantic gifts, or whatever. This literally goes on non stop. Now this go round, I have been explicit. I've told her we aren't dating, I'm not interested, and just generally to stop.

She still won't stop. She also got her job back at the drug store so have to work together. I used to like being her friend but she really creeps me out now. I don't want to go to HR and make this super messy, so what else can I do to fix this? Thank you! 

Extra information: 1.) Tom is aware of this, 2.) a lot of this also goes on via text

TLDR: I'm a gay girl and I helped my coworker come to terms with their sexuality, they haven't stopped flirting with me since despite me telling them to numerous times."
"My (28F) ex boyfriend (28M) cheated on me, and may have given me HPV. Do I have a responsibility to tell him?


Long story short, we were together for 3 years, until I found out that he was cheating on me and we broke up. I was obviously devastated, and I haven’t talked to him since I kicked him over a year ago, and I don’t really want to talk to him ever again.

Because he cheated, I got tested shortly after we broke up. Everything came back negative, so I figured I was in the clear and have spent the last year moving on and trying to be happy. The last few months, I’ve been having pretty severe pain and cramping, so I set up an appointment with my gyno to get everything checked out. She did a checkup and said everything looked pretty normal, but recommended another test swab just in case. The test results came back, and they were positive for HPV. I was also devastated to learn that because of this, I have some potentially pre-cancerous or cancerous cells (which likely caused the pain), and need to go back for a bigger tissue sample and biopsy to see if I need to begin treatment or if I may face infertility problems.

I’ve never had a positive test before in my life, and I’ve only slept with 1 person since we broke up (my new boyfriend). I told him about it immediately. We had a long conversation about our sexual history, and he doesn’t think that he spread it to me. I know it may sound naïve, but he truly is a wonderful person and I don’t think that he would lie about something like this that could potentially impact multiple people’s health. He has been very understanding and supportive, and is going to the doctor with me next week for my biopsy. 

I asked my gyno about it, and she said it’s pretty common for people to not test positive for several months. So, it’s quite possible that my ex got it from one of the girls he cheated on me with, and then passed it along to me, and it just didn’t show up on the first test.

So here’s my dilemma: Is it my responsibility to let my ex know? I can’t be 100% sure that I got it from him, however, he seems the likely culprit since he was sleeping around and lying to me. And, I know HPV isn’t one of the “worst” diseases (it’s not HIV or herpes or anything), but I know I was personally devastated to learn I have it. My initial reaction was to feel unclean, and now I’m just in terror of cancer or infertility. I already have a lot of animosity towards my ex, and this is just fuel to the fire.

A big part of me feels like it’s not my problem, since I didn’t give it to him. But, part of me feels like I have a responsibility to let him know he may be a carrier, so that he’s not hurting anyone else in ignorance, and so he could potentially tell the people he’s slept with so they can get checked out too. But, he’s already proven to be a bad person, so it’s just as likely he would continue lying and potentially spread it to more people, in which case I would have to go through this painful experience for nothing.

TLDR: my ex may have given me HPV as a result of cheating on me. Is it my responsibility to let him know that he may be a carrier (when I can’t be 100% sure that he is the culprit), and to encourage him to tell his sexual partners, or is it not my problem?"
"My [24M] girlfriend of 3 years [23F] drinks 30oz of water MAX per day


I need some advice on how to get my gf to realize her lack of eating and drinking is causing a cycle of issues.

My girlfriend claims she can only drink ""little sips"" of liquid at a time which ends up to her drinking about 20oz of water and an additional 10oz of other liquid (coffee, tea) per day. 30oz of liquid is NOT enough for a human to function long term.

She complains of bodily pain, fatigue, headaches, the whole nine yards. We've gone to tons of doctors and her tests are healthy as can be. I know it's her lack of drinking causing all of her issues but am at wits end on how to get her to 1st realize this is the issue and 2nd do something about it.

I realize this looks extremely clear - tell her to drink more. Trust me, I've tried every type of logical conversation with her on why this is more important but each day all I hear is ""I don't feel good."" followed along with ""but I drank a bottle of water today!""

Reddit, how can I get my gf to drink more water?

"I [f18] want more emotional intimacy with my bf [m18] but it seems like he just shuts down


We have been dating for 5 months and it’s been good, we just haven’t had any issues. Which I don’t know if it’s a good or bad thing. 


I don’t have anyone close to me to talk to about serious things and so naturally I just want to talk about these things with the person I spend the most time with... but I notice he seems to steer the conversations away from anything serious. Like if I start talking about my mom,
 (which is a tender subject, for me) he’ll maybe reply and then try to change the topic really quickly by talking about whatever movie’s playing. 


When I think about what I want in a boyfriend I want someone who’s close to me that I can share things with... but it’s like my bf is afraid of that? I want to be understanding but it’s hard to work towards getting him to feel close to me emotionally when he won’t even breach those subjects in the slightest. and I have so much bottled up and so much bothering me about my life but noone to tell. I sent him a snap about how I cried over something and he just left me on opened. he could have said something. but I could be overthinking all of this because I tend to do that.


I haven’t brought this up because I have no idea how to. I don’t want him to feel forced to open up to me but I’m feeling like there’s this distance between us. I love a lot of things about him, he’s patient, kind, always makes time for me. he encourages my hobbies and my goals for the future. he was good with his friend who went through a tough time recently. there’s been more than a couple times I’ve wanted to tell him “I love you” but I didn’t because in a strange way I feel like that would be opening up emotionally and it just scares me that he might just change the subject and ignore it. 



TL;DR: 
I feel like there’s emotional distance between me and my bf and I’m just wondering how to bring it up to him."
"My [27F] bf [30M] of 2 years broke up w/me yesterday randomly, during a period of high stress. He then took it back and requests I forget about it. Where do I go from here?


Pretty frequent commenter and redditor, but I think my bf knows my reddit so using an alt just to be safe. My boyfriend and I have a pretty dang solid relationship. We don't argue frequently, and when we disagree we are able to communicate and talk about what's going on and resolve issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are both serious about our relationship, and my bf has brought up wanting to get married in the next year or so. He's talked about how much he cares about me and loves me, and I trust him wholeheartedly. I know he has not been talking to or seeing anyone else, and this is not a trust issue. The last 2 weeks have been very very stressful. I lost my job (I have never been without a job before) and he has been dealing with some family stress (they live in another country.) I know this has been incredibly hard on him, and I've been leaning on him for support (although maybe more than I should. My group of friends is spreadout throughout the US, and my family is a 'justno,' and this job loss has hit me hard.)

&amp;#x200B;

He came over yesterday and just said 'I don't think this is working.' I asked him what he meant, or what he was referring to and he said 'I don't know.' I asked for more details, or if he was just stressed (work is also stressful, he is in an incredibly demanding job industry) and he said he wasn't sure. I sat down with him and said he needed to talk to me... that I understood the last couple of weeks have been a bit chaotic and I apologize for being a bit anxious with everything going on, but if there was something else we needed to talk about that I wanted to talk about it. He's really good about talking to me about things that bother him, or things that he doesn't like (example: 'it hurts my feelings when you say something like this, could you phrase it differently next time') so for him to just say 'this isn't working' was out of the blue.) I asked if he was breaking up with me and he said 'he didn't know.' I let him sit and think for a good, maybe 20 minutes before I said 'I honestly think that you're just stressed right now, and i am sorry if i have contributed to that. Let me know what I can do to help. If you really do want to break up, or if there's something else going on that you've been thinking about, let me know and I will help you gather up your things. If you want to work on our relationship then I will do what it takes, and you know that. But if you are done, then I'm not sure what I can do or what has happened here.' (side note, he basically lives here.) I was more just in shock than anything, we laugh all the time, we cook everything together, we aren't co-dependent and have a pretty well rounded relationship. We have separate friend groups and activities, both have good income and hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

He started to cry (he is NOT a crier. I have never seen him cry ever.) and just said he thinks he's confused and just stressed, and taking it out on me, and could I please just forget he even said anything, and could I please forgive him. After that I gave him some space for a bit, then we made dinner, watched a movie, cracked jokes and were just silly, and everything was fine... but now that he's left for work I'm kind of alone in my thoughts and wondering if I should be worried about this. There really haven't been any glaring red flags, and we generally deal with our stress in a healthy way (but I can't think of a time that we have both had a major stress at the same time.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've spoken with my closest friend about it, and while she said it would stress her out, too, she doesn't think I should worry about it because this isn't at all a pattern for him and he's never acted like this before. He genuinely seemed embarrassed about it and when he left this morning (as well as the remainder of last night) it was as if nothing happened. Should I just let this go, and continue to work on our relationship and make sure we are managing our stress levels? Or am I maybe missing something here? Is this normal?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue while we are both very very stressed. He then said he took it back, apologized, and asked me to please forget he had ever said that and that he didn't mean it. Where do I go from here? "
"Video games and my relationship?? 20F and 22M


I've been with my SO for nearly two years--I'm almost twenty and he's about to turn 22--but he's been in a relationship with video games for much longer than he's known me.

As kids, we had very different interests. My nose was always in a book, while he spent his time in front of a computer. I have some opinions about this, but in the grand scheme of things, how can I complain about what makes happy the guy who makes me happy? 

To combat the difference in upbringings, I think he would be really appreciative if I tried to show an interest in video games. I just don't know where to start! We have other things in common (ie, love watching soccer and bingewatching House/other shows on Netflix), but I'm looking for a way to understand why he likes playing video games.

Any suggestions on ""beginner"" video games? I have a laptop--not completely technologically inept--and am not looking to shell out $ for this endeavor (broke college student lyfe, amiright?) but would be willing to invest some time.


TL;DR: College age GF wants to get interested in video games to connect with her BF"
"I (24f) recognize that my boyfriend (35m) has an equal amount of “good” and “bad” qualities. Am I silly for thinking that we could have a happy marriage together one day?


I’ve been living with him for one year and together for three. He is incredibly troubled (depression, low mood, ocd, lack of motivation) but also has a lot of great qualities (Caring, loving, considerate, empathetic and kind, supportive, and incredibly generous). 

Life with him can sometimes be very difficult. I can honestly say that he has a balance between the desirable and undesirable qualities. I am happy with him but life with him is not the easiest thing in the world.  

I’ve been with him since I was 22 and I am imagine that if I go back out into the dating cool I will never meet anyone that has the good qualities that he possesses. It’s as if , In my mind, everyone is exceptionally awful  . although he has shortcomings-  anyone else would have far more. I know this is a irrational.  

My friends and family seem to think I am settling. I do love him deeply. I even thought one day we could get married and have a family. The thing is one of his shortcomings is that he is not honest, so he is not telling me clearly if he wants to do those things. He also maintains massive lies to his family that I have to maintain too, which can be incredibly difficult because they are really kind and generous people and have made me feel so welcomed.   

Some of you might think that I could possibly motivate him to be more reflexive and make changes for the positive in his life. The thing is he absolutely hates reflecting on his life because it makes him deeply depressed. And if I ever try to motivate him to change he absolutely refuses to citing the fact that he’s 10 years older and has already delved deep inside of himself to examine himself. I never say this, but he absolutely seems like someone who is a stranger to himself and has not actually unearthed  the true nature of his being, as he thinks he has. 
 
I think I’m being naive to think this man is a good choice. I plan on breaking things off if he doesn’t purpose by the time I’m 26. But getting over him will probably be one of the hardest things I ever do because I’m so many ways we really was wonderful.  

Any thoughts, advice, insight, or personal stories would be nice to read. I will respond to each one. Thank you. 

TL;DR : 
He has great qualities but equally bad ones, I think I might be silly for wanting to have a marriage with him "
"Issues that were unfixable in our relationship are now fixable. Should I [29F] try to reconcile with my ex [33M]? [Long]


THROWAWAY obviously.

So my ex and I have been broken up for 2 weeks. Things ended really amicably. I told him I needed some time to heal and that we could maybe be friends down the road.

For some back story this is what led to our breakup: I am bipolar. One last mood swing two weeks ago did us in. I switched meds in March of 2018 last year and that’s when my life started to go downhill. I became very panicky and clingy as the months went on, had insane bouts of mania and then a four month period of depression, cried over everything, and went into mania so bad I racked up enough debt to cause me to file bankruptcy.

These are all huge red flags that would make anyone want to run for the hills. But I recently went back on my old medicine that made me stable a month ago. I was starting to feel better but started getting a little foggy as I was titrating off my old med and still had some mood swings. Ever since 2 weeks ago I have been so stable it’s insane. I visited my doctor last week who confirmed I was stable and that we should stay on it. He also told me that a lot of people react poorly to the other med I was on and my behavior was most likely due to the medicine since none of these things had happened on the old one. I only cried once last week over something legitimate. I felt like I did a year ago before this all happened. I’m financially back on my feet as well.

As far as affection and kids go, I was becoming so clingy and wanted affection and praise constantly since I was so depressed. Since becoming stable again I realize I don’t need that. I just need someone to have my back, and he did....I also dealt with a clingy, crying best friend last week and realized how annoying it would be if she was like that every day for 4 months....

Kids: it’s not that I don’t want them, I was just scared to go off my medicine while pregnant because I’m such a high risk for post partum depression. I found out I can be pregnant and stay on this medicine when I went to the doctor this week and my heart sunk into my stomach.

All of these are huge issues that are now resolved. We had a really nice texting conversation on Saturday. After some pleasantries he said “I was going to text you last night but I didn’t want to disturb anything. I just wanted to let you know I’m doing okay and I hope you are too.” I tell him I wanted to text him the night before too. He tells me he woke up to a wall of text in his phone he almost sent me.

He was blowing up my phone like he did when we first met. He texted me a brain dump about how he’s freaking out about pulling money out of his savings to go on this snowboarding trip this week, and after 7 texts in a row he ends it with, “But I’m single now and staying home is cheap so I got that going for me.”

After picking my jaw up off the floor, I sent a response about how everything will be fine and I had to go as I was having ppl over later, mutual friends of ours actually. He said, “I’m so happy you guys are still hanging out. Don’t talk too much shit 😂 although I understand if you must.” I said, “I honestly haven’t said one bad thing about you” - which has been the truth. I continued “I mean obviously we’re both still hurt sad etc but at the end of the day it is what it is and I don’t want there to be any hard feelings.”

He didn’t respond after that. Then yesterday (Sunday) I get 3 texts from him: he’s up early because he has to get stuff ready for this trip, two hours later he texts that he’s just gonna come over tomorrow (today, Monday) after work and also would I mind stopping over a few times while he’s gone so I can feed his fish? I said sure.

I haven’t heard anything since. When (if?) he comes over tonight I was going to sit him down and talk very openly and candidly. Shoot my shot, if you will. I was going to start off with how I’ve been on this sub and the unsent letters sub and half the posts are from people that have broken up with other people and regretted it. They want to say something, but don’t. So then no one says anything. Then tell him everything I wrote out up there. And then say, “Can we just start over? It’s obvious we still love each other. I don’t think we got a fair shot at this when I was on my different med. I feel like the woman you fell in love with again. The time is going to pass anyway, so what do you think about taking things extremely slow, not having each other’s keys, not sleeping over right away, not leaving shit at each other’s place, and continue doing what we need to do to work on ourselves and just try dating each other again? And then in a few months if things are still going well we can officially get back together."" 

I was then going to tell him that he doesn’t have to make a decision right away, go on the trip and think about it.

Is this a terrible idea?

TLDR: Major issues in our relationship that seemed unfixable are now suddenly fixable. My ex and I have only been broken up two weeks, our text conversation made me feel like there’s hope for a reconciliation. Should I go for it and have a candid conversation about it?"
"My (m28) girlfriend (f29) is stressed out by her parents visiting, and I'm not sure how to help.


I've been with my girlfriend about a year now, we moved in together a few months ago. For some background: she is Chinese, grew up in China, and her parents still live there.

She complained about her parents a *lot* while we've been dating, and it seems like she's never really had a positive relationship with them. Some of the stuff she's told me about her childhood sounds downright abusive. Anyway, they decided to visit so I could finally get to meet them. They don't speak english and they can't drive, so (unfortunately) they had to stay with us, in our apartment. On top of that, they're here for like 6 weeks.

At first it wasn't so bad. They were a lot warmer and friendlier than I had been picturing. They've been super nice to me, almost too nice - they keep trying to buy me new expensive clothes that I don't really need. They also cook dinner for us every night, and her dad is a really good cook. The culture barrier actually kinda helps me, since I get away with a lot of stuff that a Chinese boyfriend would not be able to. But as they've stayed with us I've started to see why they drive her crazy.

Basically it’s a combination of a lot of stuff. Like I said, they are often too nice, to the point where it’s actually unhelpful. They’ll cook food for me even if I’m not hungry, which is especially annoying since I’ve been trying to lose weight. She got in a little fight with her mom over loading the dishwasher - her mom will do it even if she’s exhausted, even if my gf said that we will do it, and she often does it wrong. They both apparently have a habit of making negative comments to themselves constantly (“this apartment isn’t very nice, you could be living in a much nicer apartment in China” “why are you taking so long to get ready?” “it’s too cold out, we should go home” “we spend too much time at home, we should go out”). They both like to nag her to do stuff for them, even if someone else is talking to her (namely, me), and even if she’s in a whole other room. These are just examples off the top of my head, but it’s a lot of stuff like this, all the time for her. They aren’t bad people, but they both have personalities that tend to grate on you if you’re with them for a long time (like, say, 6 weeks).

Now, I can deal with this stuff pretty well, mostly because I didn’t grow up with them and I don’t speak fluent mandarin. I have no problem telling them no if I don’t want anymore food, or if I don’t want them to buy me something (even if it is kind of annoying that I have to). But what does bother me is seeing my gf constantly upset and frustrated living with them, and I don’t get why she spends so much time with them when they make her miserable (she visited them twice already since we’ve been dating, both times for a pretty long time). I’ve tried to help her deal with them like I would, by making strong boundaries and enforcing them, which she has sorta started to do. Ultimately though she can’t change them. What I think would help most of all is if she simply did not spend so much time with them, but the one time I brought that up she didn’t respond very well. It kinda seems like she’s resigned herself to being constantly made miserable by her parents, and I’m not sure what else I can do.


TL;DR My girlfriend's parents make her stressed out and miserable when she spends time with them."
"Fiancé [26] didn't get the job, how can I [24] cool him down?


My finance has his masters in business and just interviewed for a job.  They asked him a business question during the interview and he didn't know the answer.  They basically cut the interview short right then and there and said they'll call if they need anything else.  

He's crushed, because it was the perfect salary and not too far away from home.  There are more jobs out there but they are 45 mins + away from home.  Long story short, he's absolutely  crushed and heading home right now.  

From a man's point of view, how can I make him feel any less hurt about not getting this job?  How can I Cheer him up or at the very least make him not more angry?

TLDR:  My finance interviewed for a job and didn't get it.  He's crushed and in a terrible mood.  How can I make him feel better?  Or at least, how Can I make him not MORE mad when he gets home?  Any advice on how to cool down a man?!"
"Should I (30f) accept my boyfriends (30m) offer to marry me so i can stay in the country?


Me and my BF has been together for two years. We have a really great relationship and I love him dearly. 


I’ve been going through the process of immigration recently and im applying for a visa to extend my stay, i’ve been diligent about making sure that i can stay here, so that i can keep working and also so i can stay with my SO.  
 

I have never expected for him, to solve my problems. I’ve been trying to come up solutions myself but recently he offered me the option of getting married so i can stay-but i am not sure if i should accept. 


To be clear i do see myself with him in the long run and truly believe we could build great things together- but i would have rather let our relationship grow into marriage organically instead of just getting hitched due to some sort of expiration date urgency. That being said he has offered more than once and he seems to genuinely want to stay with me for the long haul and so do i. 


He says instead of me spending all this time money in processing fees and lawyers we could put that into a bank account together and invest into something worthwhile like property. He makes a good point. 


I am reluctant because i don’t want to seem like i am taking advantage of him, or that im with him with just because of his citizen status... it seems to soon as we have only bene together for two years . i’ve also never held marriage as one of my life goals.  But at the same time this could solve my problems very quickly- and it would also take away the fear and anxiety that i’ve been feeling nonstop about the uncertainty of my future and my relationship. 


The other thing that crosses my mind is that i have no idea what i would do to repay someone for doing this immense favor for me. All can think of is offering to take care of all home matters, bookkeeping and other responsibilities while my processing goes through to ensure he can be relaxed and focused on his career. 



TLDR; my boyfriend is offering to get married so i can stay in the US and I’m not sure if i should do it. We love each other but it seems rushed. Not sure if its a good idea but im tempted to accept.

"My (23M) Wife(23F) of 2 years doesn't work, or do anything around the house


I have been married for a couple of years now and my wife didn't move in with me until we got married (we dated for 6 years before marriage).

She asked if she could be a stay at home wife, and I was okay with this as she didn't make much money anyway and it would relieve the stress off of me working and going to school to have the home taken care of. But she didn't really do any house cleaning or cooking. But I ignored it (foolishly) because I'm an adult and I'll keep my own stuff clean and make food or we'll go out or whatever.

Fast forward a couple of years and we have a one year old daughter and she just lets the house turn to a disaster and makes no effort to clean it up, she goes to her grandmothers house during the day and watches Netflix while.i work and go to school then I come home to the house extremely frustrated.

So I work 50+ hours a week on top of going to school for engineering so i have a lot on my plate, when i bring up my concerns with my wife she just gets defensive and starts crying and telling me how hard it is with our daughter (which I am somewhat sympathetic too but its wearing thinner everyday)

Am I in the wrong for expecting a somewhat clean house and a meal when I get home at least a few days a week?

I feel like I'm working so hard to pull my family forward but I'm getting no help or support.

On top of this she complains about me going to school and working so much, but she wont considering going back to work, so I have no choice but work the way I do, I would love to take a job working less hours, I even got an offer for an adjunct position at a locale community college teaching some classes related to my current career.

Sorry about the wall of text, does anyone have any advice I feel like this is going to destroy our marriage, because if it wasn't for our daughter I probably would have left by now, which hurts to even type.


Tldr: wife doesn't work, cook, clean or really support me at all while I work 50+ hours a week and go to school for engineering taking 5 classes."
"I (m19) recently told my fiance (f22) of 4 months that I watched porn behind her back.


I explained to her that I get urges when she's not there but I've been doing it less frequently as time goes on. She said she understands but pins it to her not being attractive enough, and that she waits for me instead of having to see other people naked and fucking. Now she runs and goes to the gym in order to satisfy me, but I dont want her to change. I think she's perfect the way she is and I can't think of a way to defuse her insecurities.

I know I betrayed her and I probably deserve it, but I feel like our relationship isn't the same anymore. She's more distant and I feel like she doesn't love me comfortably the way she did before. I really think she's the one but I don't know what to do to regain her respect and love.

TL;DR - I confessed to fiance that I watched porn and flared her insecurities. Now I'm clueless on what to do to fix it."
"My [21F] boyfriend [27M] says he doesn't feel the spark anymore


So me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship for almost 2 months, after having just 2 weeks of dating. We went fast, I know that, but we had an amazing connection and it didn't feel wrong in any way. We were crazy about each other so, why not? 

Yesterday it was pouring outside, so we couldn't go outside. Usually we play a match of scrabble or do something else, but yesterday we were both a bit uneasy and didn't really know what to do. I asked him what was wrong and he told me that he was afraid that he wasn't feeling it anymore and it scared him. 

I am a 3rd year lawstudent and a part-time teacher, he works full time. I have my own appartement, where we always spend the weekend, because he lives with his parents after he moved out with his ex-girlfriend about 6 months ago. Because I am a student but have my own appartement, I don't have a lot of money. He told me that one of the reasons he is afraid it is not going to work, it is because he wants to travel and I can't . He never told me anything about travelling and he never asked me if it was even a possibility.

I also need some personal space, just like he does. But that does not mean that we suddenly have to break up, just because we have seen each other too much for the past 2 months, right?

I can not imagine that you suddenly loose feelings. I do imagine that at some point, the whole excitement is kind of over. I don't have a huge smle on my face when he texts me anymore, because I am used to us being together. It is not new anymore. And it scares me, that he thinks we should break up over the fact that the honeymoonphase is over... What do I do? Do I play hard to get, leave him alone or act like nothing happened?

We chose to take a step back and just ""date"" again. No sleepovers, no whole weekends together, but just one night per week where we have dinner and talk. Will this help?

TL;DR: My boyfriend of 2 months might want to break up because he believes we are losing the spark. We are now stepping back to 'first base dating', so no sleepovers and stuff. Will this help?"
"How do I (21/M) support my long distance girlfriend when she's going through a tough time (20/F)


So.. this has been tough, I started dating this girl a few months ago, she lives in NZ I live in New York there's a lot of distance between us but we make it work. Her and her family aren't doing too well and they can barely afford to put food on the table and pay bills. She's never once asked me for money or anything and she's trying to get over her mental issues and look for a job but it's a process, she has extremely bad social anxiety and just recently started therapy. They have a place to stay and everything but they're not doing too well, actually after this month she won't be able to get online for at least 2-3 weeks because her internet bill wasn't paid and is 3 months overdue. Her power bill is also currently overpaid. She lives with her parents still and they are in charge of finances. I've tried to be as supportive as I can be, we do things she even falls asleep in call with me. She's been nothing but a wonderful and beautiful person and hasn't asked for a thing even when things have been tough. With valentines day coming up I wanted to get her something special and I actually already did that but I wanted to know if there were any ways I could help her while she sorts things out? She's gonna be gone for a few weeks maybe longer soon.. I don't pity her, I just.. I'm sad such an amazing person has to go through such shitty circumstances.

Tldr; my girlfriend is going through a really tough situation financially and she doesn't want any help. What do I do to support her emotionally?

"I (28m) just started talking to my ex (24f) who I still have strong feelings for even after three years of almost no contact


Me and my Ex met when I was about 19, we dated for about 6 years and had our highs and lows but we were always so emotionally attached to each other. We lived about an hour away from each other most of our relationship which was always a strain.

Well things started getting kinda bad around the time I was 25, My grandpa ended up getting a terminal cancer and I ended up taking care of him until he passed, during all of this I kinda started to shut my self off from the world. She honestly tried to help me out but I wasn’t willing to accept help I just wanted to feel bad for myself in a way. 

I had pretty much stopped texting her back or calling her (the relationship was already over at this point) so it got to the point where she told me that she had met a new guy and I needed to figure my shit out because she couldn’t do this forever. It wasn’t fair for me to expect her to wait forever when I was acting the way I was so I let her go without a fight.

She ended up in another long term relationship and although I’ve been with other girls I’ve never really been able to get over her. I spent the years just trying to work on finding what made me happy. Three years later and her and her new boyfriend have broken up and we’ve been back in contact. 

She wants to hangout and catch up soon but I’m not sure what to think, for the longest time I was so emotionally dependent on her it almost ruined my life and I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t depend on anybody for my happiness and I’m in a really good spot mentally, would hanging out and potentially getting back together be a bad idea? 

TL;DR me and gf of 6 years broke up and didn’t talk much for 3 years and now are in contact again, my emotional attachment to her and my grandpa passing wrecked me mentally and I’ve finally gotten back to a good spot in life without any help and can see myself being with her again, is this a good or bad idea?

"My (f19) Ex (18m) wants no contact- but my grandmas in the hospital.


But of a backstory: I was an awful girlfriend. He was caring and loving no matter what, but I’d get so focused on something I’d lash out about every small thing. My anxiety disorder caused me to get angry about little things and I struggled to let it go.

It caused many fights, and finally the last straw hit the camels back. He broke up with me, and I flipped the coop. I was depressed and suicidal, tried to use that to get him back. Look, I know it’s awful. I still haven’t forgiven myself. He told me to get help, and I have been. I went to emergency therapy for a week and now as I head home I have therapy appointments set up.

Finally yesterday and the day before we went no contact, yesterday a small convo happened, but basically he said he had no interest in talking to me anymore.  Well, he said that earlier but my anxiety and frivolous attempts to try to offer to fix everything just made it worse. He said maybe after I was better we could talk again, possibly another chance but also he “didn’t talk in hypotheticals”. 

I went upstate to help my grandma move right after the breakup, and all week it ate at me. Finally the day to go back home came, and as soon as I boarded the 6 hour bus ride - a call came from my mom saying my grandmother was taken to the emergency room for a pneumonia. She’s a heavy smoker and overweight, but my best friend. we talk about everything, and she raised me.

I don’t have many real friends, a few people I talk to but who have no interest in anything more than “hey how’s X?” I’ve tried to create opportunities to make more friends but never succeeded. The people I used to talk to shut me out recently, and I was dumped.

He always said he’d be there if I ever needed him. Now my grandmas in the hospital and just yesterday he told me he didn’t want to talk. He’s probably the only person who knows the extent of my families issues, my own mental struggles and the guilt I constantly hold.

tldr: bad breakup with ex who told me he would always be there no matter what, and knows my family history. He wants no contact, but my grandma was just hospitalized."

"Seriously need some advice on this relationship


tl;dr: girl I like is with friend that is emotionally abusive. How do I tell her that she deserves better?  


 I'm a 19 year old guy and I've never really had a true relationship with a significant other, even like a true friend where I can literally just vent to and tell my feelings. My friend of 6 years has been with this girl for like three years and recently me and her are getting closer, just as friends. Like, I would say what is bothering me in life and she would comfort me, then she did the same with me and said what her problems are and I comfort her. we talk everyday and she honestly brings me so much joy. We can literally talk all night and it feels so good to have a intellectually stimulating conversation with her. I help her with her emotionally, and also with her homework a lot (she is taking a lot of college classes to become a nurse) and I remind her that she is awesome and she helps me emotionally too. We are just friends, but I honestly want to be more with her. I've come to like her more than my friend of 6 years. I tell her that I am thankful that she is in my life and that she is the best thing that has happened to me, but I can't bring myself to tell her that I love her, because she is with my friend. This girl is the only girl that i think I've actually fallen in love with. The friend of 6 years has always been a dick and a hypocrite and a lair to everyone. He doesn't care about others feelings and as soon as someone hurts his feelings and he gets upset, it's unfair and blah blah. He complains about every little thing he has to do for her, like simply get up and stop playing games to walk the dog outside. Meanwhile she does everything for him and he complains if she doesn't do it, or that he can't get his way. They're about to move out of the girls moms house, yes he lives with her and her parents, and she is telling me that he is getting worse and pushing her away. he claims that he is going to change when they move and he blames the way he acts on her mom, which is also emotionally abusive. If you have to tell someone that you are going to change later, do you really think that they are going to change? She said ""Why can't he change right now, why does it have to be until we move"". She told me that she is afraid that he won't change when they move and she doesn't know what to do. I can tell she is not happy with him but she tells me that she is afraid to leave him because they've been together for so long and that she likes his family. I live with my parents, which are totally fine with letting her stay, and I could totally bring her in if she breaks up with him, but I don't want to tell her that she deserves better ya know? I don't want to be that person who just rants about their significant other, that seems rude and unfair. I've known the dude longer than her, but that doesn't give me the right to tell her that I want them to break up and that I love her. What do I do? Any advice on what to do and what NOT TO DO? I have a paragraph already typed out on what I was going to send her, but I thought I'd get a few others input before sending it. the first half is me telling her how he makes ME feel. Stuff along the lines of me telling her how he treats his friends. How he lies about stupid shit and WILL NOT knowledge that he is wrong or that he can't get his way. ""over the years of knowing X, I've become more silent when we argue because it's honestly not worth it arguing with a brick wall, and one day I think I am going to explode. This is not how it should be."" she even said the same thing to me in a discord call about how she might explode one day. The other part of the paragraph I was going to send her went like: ""I don't think he is going to change"" ""Y'all are living together right now and it's this bad?"" ""if you have a fear of him not changing, it won't go away"" ""if he treats you wrong emotionally, he's always going to do that"" etc. I want to tell her these things, but I don't know if that's too far. Please someone give me some advice. "
"I [20M] want to message my ex of four years [21M] but I’m not sure it’s the right choice


So, a bit of backstory. 

My ex and I met on Facebook through some mutual friends when I was sixteen and he was seventeen. He hit me up one day and we started dating shortly after. Right around the same time I was being put on intensive treatment for an illness I’d been suffering from since I was eleven. Suffice to say it hit me pretty hard, my energy levels dropped, my appetite disappeared, I was constantly nauseated, it wasn’t a fun point in my life.

Obviously, this had an effect on my relationship with my ex, who was a very sensitive guy who needed a lot of attention in a relationship. In the state I was in I definitely wasn’t as attentive as I needed to be. I spent much of my time sleeping which I guess was something he had trouble believing because he would text my mom and my friends to ask them what I was *really* doing. Despite the reassurance from them that I was indeed sleeping, he confessed that he suspected I was cheating on him. I tried to convince him that I wasn’t as I had remained faithful throughout our entire relationship, I’m not sure he believed me, it wasn’t like there was much I could do to prove it to him. I don’t know if he’s still under the belief that I cheated to this day. 

I wasn’t a great partner. There were many things I could have handled better. For one, I definitely burst on him during the whole cheating accusations and I’m sure that same knee-jerk, reactionary anger of mine came out at other times as well. While I tried to educate him on what was going on with me I don’t think I properly relayed the true scope of it, leading to such misunderstandings. I also didn’t support him as I should have, he was going through his own issues and I didn’t make enough of an effort to show him I cared. I’ve always been the type to say things without really thinking and it was particularly bad at that point in my life, many of my “jokes” would come off as hurtful and oftentimes I wouldn’t even realize I’d said such a thing in the first place. It was awful, I’ve since improved but it’s still something I struggle with to this day. I don’t doubt that I hurt him on more than a few occasions thanks to this. 

After about six months he ended things on the advice of his therapist. I had been thinking about cutting it off with him myself so there weren’t any hard feelings. We agreed to stay friends. But as many of these cases go, it didn’t work out the way that we planned and he subsequently unfriended me on Facebook a week or so later. Curiously, someone I’d been introduced to through him unfriended me at the same time as well. I don’t doubt that he told them I was a bad, inattentive lover, which I guess he wouldn’t be wrong about. After we broke up I promised myself not to enter another relationship until my health improved and I’ve kept that promise to this day. 

That brings us to where we are now. Despite one attempt to start up a conversation over Instagram that got no reply three or so years back, we haven’t talked. He hasn’t made an effort to talk to me. I’m healthier now and in a far better place than I was then, being single has helped me mature emotionally as well as focus on getting to a point of normalcy physically. Recently, he’s been on my mind and I’ve been considering messaging him again, if only to find closure. There are so many things I feel I owe him apologies for. But I don’t want to overstep and make him uncomfortable and I sure as heck don’t want to seem like some creep clinging to the past.

tl;dr: My ex and I didn’t have the healthiest relationship and he essentially cut ties after we broke up. I’ve been considering messaging him again to maybe get some closure, but I worry if it’s really the right thing to do. 

Do I let sleeping dogs lie or do I take the risk and give it a shot?"

"My [29/F] bf [M/31] has exes who still hang on and try to contact him. How to deal with this?


I've been with my boyfriend for 1.5yrs now, living together for a few months. We've had some serious bumps along the way; he's left before because he didn't know how to deal with what should have been a healthy relationship, as his only other serious one was toxic and seems to have destroyed his self esteem. We now seem to be doing quite well and he's trying to communicate better and make this work, so I'm happy. 

.

The issue is, he has had at least 2 exes, that I know of, who have tried to contact him well after their fling or short-lived relationship has ended. Prior to me, his last contact with one was in may 2017 apparently, so really, i'm not sure why they keep hanging on. He has blocked some, forgotten most, and treats it all as insignificant so he assures me I shouldn't worry and that ignoring them works. Except it doesn't. Recently, one called him 4 times in a row, drunk, on a Monday night at midnight. One, who the hell calls that many times in a row, and two, don't you work the next day?! I was uncomfortable and asked, and he lied initially saying it was his alarm, but a few minutes later said it was likely an ex as the number was blocked from texting him or something. I blew up because I've told him I will not tolerate lying, and I feel disrespected. No one wants to be reminded of their partner's past, and I struggle with jealousy issues as it is. I feel like he often avoids conflict, as I'm always the one to start difficult discussions while he prefers to pretend it's okay and it'll eventually go away. But it never works and so I'm just frustrated that he applies this logic to everything.

.

I have had exes contact me as well, up to 3yrs after breaking up, but I have no problem telling them to leave me alone so that door is closed for good, and so I don't carry that around to the next relationship. So what bothers me is that I feel it's been his habit to not tell them off so they remain a possibility should things not work out, which is where the disrespect comes in. I told him to phone whoever it was back because I wanted to know who it was, and to tell her in no uncertain terms that she is not welcome to contact him again. He finally did, and said he didn't realize how serious it was for me but that he would do the same for any others who may call or text him. He didn't ask who it was, which is something that is eating me up since I wanted to put a name to the number, but now he refuses to tell me what the number was because it's not healthy. I find it hard to move on not knowing who it was for some reason. And I can't help but jump to conclusions and think he must know but he doesn't want me to know who it was, only because he's lied or omitted details in the past. 

.

My question is, how do I get over not knowing who this *female dog* is, how do I deal with my jealousy which even I recognize can be unreasonable sometimes (was it unreasonable in this case??), and how do I just trust that he'll do his part to protect our relationship? I also feel his instinct to lie to me is concerning and the only good thing is he at least told the truth within minutes instead of months this time. But he has a history of trickle truthing me and says he doesn't like to have uncomfortable conversations that may hurt my feelings when they're not important to him. So how can I get across that if it's important to me then it should be something he needs to address? He has more experience than me yet I feel like he's emotionally stunted and doesn't know how to be in a relationship, like he doesn't think in ""us"" terms sometimes so he can come across as inconsiderate or straight up dumb sometimes, whereas I try to behave in a way where I consider his feelings at all times and do things just to make his life easier or happier. It's like he tries to protect himself first at my expense, which is why it's taken so long for him to learn that I prefer honesty from the get go instead of being lied to and making it way worse. 

.

I'm sorry this is quite long, I haven't discussed this with anyone else so it's been bothering me and I've had to bottle it up. Any help would be great, and I think I'm getting myself back into therapy to deal with it all soon. There's so much I wanted to add but this is probably the most pressing issue.

Tl;dr: bf of 1.5yrs has exes who keep popping up and calling him at inappropriate times, he tends to ignore them and says they'll eventually get the hint but they don't, so I had him call one back recently and tell her off.

Hello everyone, I've been with my (19 M) boyfriend for pretty much 3 years now and we are long-distance. He lives in FL and I live in NJ. We see each other every 4-5 months whenever I get breaks off of work/school. It may sound like a lot of time apart but it's not that bad really, since long-distance was never a problem for us. We didn't officially see each other in person until like 2 years into our dating. Distance isn't the issue here. But I'm gonna describe what IS the issue.

His mom has a lot of issues. She has underlying mental illness which causes her to lash out and be irrational to his whole family. She drinks constantly which adds fuel to the fire, as the alcohol amplifies her rage. I've never had any problems with her towards me as she's always been extremely welcoming and accepting of me. His whole family loves me. However, her issues cause my bf to go into a depressive state and this causes him to be irritable towards me at times or zoned out. I understand his feelings but at the same time, I don't know how to help him.

He asks me to do stuff like ""stand up to"" his mom or unfriend/block her from my Facebook. I told him that I am not going to do this because I am in an awkward position here. If I was to be mean to her, she'd dislike me and that'd look bad for whenever I visit his house. Last time I visited him was for the holiday season and she had an outburst on Christmas. It was so bad that his dad had her Baker Acted on Dec 26th and she was in the hospital for like 5 days. During this time, my bf was very upset and the energy was so awkward in the house.

This was bad since I was on vacation and supposed to have been enjoying my time. But instead, this incident took away some of the enjoyment. However the trip turned out fine because we stayed somewhere else other than his house towards the end of it. Anyways, I just need to know what I should do in this situation. Am I right for not wanting to stand up to her? I do not want to get involved in drama. Also, I have another visit planned in May for 2 weeks stay. What should I do if another outburst occurs during this visit? I feel so uncomfortable and awkward when I'm in the house when this stuff happens. Thank you for all your help!

\*\*TL/DR: My boyfriend's mom has mental issues and she sometimes has outbursts while I am visiting him. I feel awkward and uncomfortable not knowing what to do.\*\*"

"How do I help my [26F] boyfriend [28M] of 3 years through his depression when he resists self-care and therapy?


Context to his depression: 

* He is adopted, so naturally he has deep seated struggles with feeling abandoned and as if he needs to earn love.
* His adoptive father was physically and emotionally abusive
* He has gone through several iterations of counseling before and has never felt that they helped
* He has been rejected for a promotion at work 7 times in the last 2 years and despite the esteem of his colleagues, his bosses don't like him 
* He has been rejected multiple other times for jobs outside of his current field
* He doesn't have a college degree and feels very limited in other career paths he can take; he doesn't want to go back to school
* I am LL and we are working on our sex life but it's a big source of low self esteem for him
* He has severe cystic acne on his face, shoulders, and back that is very painful for him
* He works shift work that changes month to month so his sleep schedule is garbage 
* He has expressed suicidal desires before and he has self harmed
* He has painful foot and back issues that worsen with exercise

I have had my own experiences with depression, anxiety, self-harm, counseling, medication, etc. I have tried to share some of the things that were helpful for me on my own journey but what worked for me isn't his style. For example, counseling really helped me, but in his past it has been detrimental so he doesn't want to see a therapist. When I suggest it he feels like I'm not listening to him; the opinion that I keep to myself is that maybe he hasn't found the right therapist and that despite his past experiences the potential benefits of counseling are worth the effort of finding a good one. 

He is negative a lot of the time. He doesn't want to exercise, he doesn't want a sun lamp or a white noise machine or a sleep routine, he doesn't want to keep applying for promotions or other jobs, he doesn't want to go back to school, he doesn't want to see a counselor...I can't make him do any of these things and if I get too tough-love-y his self-esteem plummets even more. He accuses me of being bossy when I make a lot of these suggestions. 

On one level, I get it. I really do. If you were constantly in physical pain, deeply self-conscious of your physical appearance, chronically sleep-deprived, continuously rejected at work, and burdened with feelings of unworthiness/unloveability from a traumatic family past, wouldn't you feel pretty crappy? On another level, as his partner I am often frustrated as I try and fail to help him. 

I am on his side. I know depression is a disease. I know he has real obstacles to a lot of common suggestions for self-care. All that being said, I deeply believe that any improvement has to come from himself. There's only so much that I can do as an external source of affirmation and support. When I say that to him, he takes it as a cop out and feels that I am saying his depression is his fault. He says he wants to get better but from my point of view it feels like he doesn't want to do any of the work to get better. I know depression as a disease quashes a lot of the desire to do much of anything, but I don't know what else to do. When I get frustrated I uncharitably wish he wouldn't be so sensitive or take things so personally, even though I know that's just what depression does to one's brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

How can I help him? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I am struggling to help my depressed boyfriend with crappy work/family/physical health situations. He can't (sometimes I frustratedly feel he won't) take a lot of the typical recommendations for coping with depression. What can I do? "

"I need to help my friend and I don't know what to do.


LONG READ AHEAD!

This story isn't about me but about a friend I want to ""save"" from this relationship that started as cheating, and that is currently a shit-storm. 

Mark, 23M, is one of my closest friends. He's known a girl, Sara 22F, since high school and fancied her. A couple years ago he confessed to her to which he was coldly rejected but she thought they'd remain friends whereas he saw her more as an acquaintance he wanted little to do with. A couple months afterwards, on gaming voice chat, she 'meets' one of our mutual friends, Bob 24M, and after VCing in a group a couple times, she says that she ""loves him"" to Mark. Mark is the last person who cares let alone wants to hear this. Sara and Bob meet up and hook up a bit, it takes a few weeks to go very sour and throughout this, she still complains to Mark about her relationship even if Mark is shaking her off lightly. Her relationship busts hard.

Mark avoided her at this point but Sara still latches to our friend group after everyone knows that she's irrational and negative. She, over months, gains sympathy from putting her 'depressive' and 'suicidal' nature forward. I personally don't know how serious this is and have always suggested medical care and attention but my advice has always been brushed off. I've always given it the benefit of the doubt but now I'm really not sure. Anyway, through months of pity, Mark has come to forgive her and remain friends. I'd like to note that while all this is happening, Sara says two things: ""The next person I date I WILL marry because I can't survive another heartbreak"" and ""I wouldn't be able to stand if a guy cheats on me"". Keep both of these in mind.

Enter Mel, 24F, a girl Mark matches with on a dating site, a breath of fresh air because she's so grounded and down to earth. She was kind enough to drive us around as our social circle never had access to a car. She was really pretty. She was a good natured person. They date and they're happy. Suddenly no one wants to hang out with Sara because she's the one who brings the dark cloud to the party. Everyone wants to be with Mark and Mel because everyone's having a good time.

Within the month, Sara pushes Mark into cheating with her. Remember the cheating thing she said? Mark is a bit passive and naive, Mel was the first real relationship he's ever had. He responds to this by doing the worst thing possible: He breaks up with Mel, keeping the fact that he cheated a secret and goes with Sara. Now they are together and Mark's room mate no longer sees him in the house, maybe at most a week every month. He's completely abandoned his social circles to 'take care of' his girlfriend. She's very manipulative and plays Mark like a flute. Also I've been told by my friends that she tenses up around me because I'm 'competition' for his attention, hilarious. 

I ask Mark whether or not he sees a future with this girl and his reply was ""With the way things are going, it's a no."" Call back to what Sara said about not being able to 'handle another breakup'. Mark has always been the spotlight of our group, not that he aims to get attention but he just a natural attractor. Now Sara has Mark, suddenly she has that magnet and we \*barely\* see Mark.

Today is my last day in the country, I've known Mark for over 7 years, we've been extremely close and it's my last day in the country, moving out, in his own apartment and I'm... spending it alone even though he's free. That's how bad this has become. Imagine not seeing your best friend off because you needed to constantly watch your mentally deranged girlfriend. 

He's supposed to be coming over 'later'. How would you snap this kind of person awake?

I will not attach a TL;DR because I feel the events above have been summarized to the best of my ability and mostly important. Thanks for reading."

"I’m [28F] still in love with a married man[44M], but boyfriend [39M] deserves better


A few years ago, I [28F] fell in love with a married man [44M] whom I worked with. I was married at the time. 

This man (let’s call him Larry) is everything I’ve ever wanted - he’s hard working, he’s kind and respectful, and we can literally talk for hours. He has passions and hobbies, he challenges me, and he makes me a better person. We so quickly lose track of time talking about the world, politics, our hope and dreams, etc. I fell in love with him quickly, and left my husband for him 3 months after we really started seeing each other. I told my husband because I knew it wasn’t fair to him, and I felt I was betraying the new love of my life by going home to someone else. 

Me leaving my husband scared the shit out of Larry. He was also married with two kids. Long story short, we continued to see each other for years while he never told his wife. I moved to the city he lived in so we could be closer. I was always there for him, always making myself available for whenever he could sneak away for a little while to see me. 

Larry told me he couldn’t leave his family because he refused to hurt his children. They have a pretty perfect life - huge house, stay at home wife, kids happy. So while it hurts, I almost understand. He has such poor examples of divorce in his life, so he can’t imagine it for himself. 

Over the years, I’ve tried to date a little, mostly to see if I’m just blinded by Larry. Every time I’ve gotten past 3 dates with someone, Larry realizes he might lose me, does a big show of affection, like show up with flowers and tells me he’s going to leave his wife. So I always cut it off with the person I’m seeing. He makes a promise to me that he’ll leave her within a week, then a month, and so on. And he never does. This happened at least 3 times. 

Over the last 10 months, I’ve started seeing someone new, let’s call him Stan [39M]. We started as friends a few years ago, but I’ve slowly let him in closer. He’s completely opposite Larry in so many ways. He doesn’t have the career ambition I’ve always wanted in a partner, he doesn’t have a clue what’s going on in the world, and he falls short of my dream “list” in a lot of ways. But, he is incredibly kind. We genuinely enjoy spending time together. Time with him is so laid back. He’s opposite Larry, and he’s opposite me. But he’s been one of the best things to happen to me in a long time. 

I met Stan’s family over the holidays. It was a big step for us. But now, I’m at a point where I feel like I should decide whether I will continue to see Larry. 

I only talk to and text Larry during the workday - we draw the line when we go home since we both have other obligations. We talk to each other on the phone everyday on our way to and from work. We no longer have a sexual relationship. I haven’t slept with him since being with Stan. But we meet for a drink or lunch once every couple weeks, and I know I’m lying by not disclosing it to Stan. 

I can’t imagine not having Larry in my life. He’s my best friend, but I still hurt deeply whenever I am reminded that he goes home to someone else, and I’m afraid it affects my relationship with Stan. 

Stan knows Larry exists. It’s just unspoken between us. I think it’s a combination of Stan not wanting to force me to make a decision because he’s afraid of what I would choose, and him preferring to pretend Larry doesn’t exist. Stan has loved me unconditionally for years.

This is my first time posting, and I’m not sure what I’m looking for. I guess if anyone has had a similar experience, or success in continuing to keep the person they love in their life while maintaining a healthy relationship, I’d love to hear more. 

I know - I’m the worst. I just want to be happy. 

TLDR: I’m still in love with the man I left my ex-husband for, but my boyfriend is so kind, and I don’t want to hurt him. "
"Advice needed - reaching out to ex with letter


  

Ex (20M) broke up with me (20F) 3 months ago. We haven't spoken since.  Whenever he sees me around town he turns and looks at me for ages (I know this might mean nothing btw).  Without going into a lot of detail, I can now understand why he felt like he had to do it. We were both suffering from mental health issues at the time. I want to reach out to him as I feel that if I don't I will regret it. I don't expect him to even reply, but I don't want to live with the ""what if"". If I send this then whatever the outcome, I think it will help me move on fully. So I'd be really grateful if anyone has any thoughts on how it makes you feel, how to make it better etc. He wasn't perfect - he hurt me a lot too. But I don't want to make him feel guilty. The past is the past. However, I do want to apologise for my part. It's really important to say that although the break up was painful, it was definitely the right thing at the time. I've done a lot of work on myself over the past 3 months and feel very different now. I suppose writing this is part of the healing process for me. This is NOT supposed to be a way to get him to come back to me at all, but I also want him to know that I'm open to exploring a new relationship with him (whatever that may be). Thanks guys!

\-----------------------------------------

Dear X

I never thought I’d ever contact you again, and to be frank I’m not sure I will ever send this, but I feel I need to write this down, even if it’s just for me.

First, I want to say something that is actually quite difficult to write - thank you for breaking up with me when you did. Yeh, I know it’s a really weird thing to say, but please know that I don’t mean it in a nasty way at all. It was the most painful thing to go through at the time. I loved you. You were my best friend. I wasn’t ready to lose you, to lose us, but ironically it was the best thing that could have happened to me because it forced me to face myself.

I’ve realised that I ended up focussing on our relationship as a way to avoid facing everything I was going through, and that was wrong of me. Although I didn’t acknowledge it at the time, I know now that I started to project my frustration and the way I was feeling about myself onto you, our relationship and my family. You were trying to help me, to support me, to encourage me, to love me, yet the only one that could really help me was myself, so I pushed back and pushed you away, and for that I am sorry.

I also want to say how sorry I am for how I was during the last weeks of our relationship and for the hurt and pain that I caused. I know that the way I sometimes reacted was not right. I did want to support you, to listen to you, to show you that I wanted you, to show you that I loved you, because I did. I know that it wasn’t wrong of me to be hurt and to react to what you told me, but the way I handled it was not the best way for me or you. I remember you telling me that you felt I was focussing on the bad things you did and not the good, and you were right. And there were so many good things. I understand that no one can or should be expected to be perfect and that everyone makes mistakes. Everyone also deserves forgiveness, and I’m so sorry that I made you feel that I didn’t forgive you. At the time, I didn’t know how to get past what you told me and that was ultimately on me. I know you weren’t perfect nor blameless, but this is not about blame. This is about me recognising and taking responsibility for my own actions and any hurt I caused to myself and those around me. All I can do is say how sorry I am and to thank you for everything you did for me and tried to do for me.

Choosing to face my fears and work through my issues these past few months has been a very difficult road, but one I am so thankful to have taken. I think you’d be proud of me, of how far I’ve come, but more importantly I am so happy to say that I’m proud of myself. I hope this doesn’t sound too narcissistic (because it’s not meant to), but I have also forgiven myself which I think is really important too. To be able to now rely on myself for my happiness and to finally accept that my weaknesses are not failures, to forgive myself and let go of all the hurt, anger, frustration and pain is an amazing feeling.

I don’t know what’s been going on in your life, but I truly hope you are happy and well. I hope you had an amazing birthday and that your xxx applications are going really well. I hope I’m not overstepping the mark, but I did notice recently that you used my xxx account to book your trip to Spain next month (I don’t mind, btw, lol). I do hope you have a good time. I remember you told me that when you went this time last year you were quite anxious, so I really hope you are okay. It’s probably not a very appropriate thing to say, and I apologise in advance, but I am sad that I’m not able to hold your hand through it.

You are an amazing person with a wonderful heart. We both made mistakes. I don’t blame you, I don’t hate you. You were my best friend. You truly meant so much to me and I am so grateful for it all – playing guitar and singing together, dancing around your bedroom, cooking together, walking hand in hand, lying in your arms, painting at your xxx, going on day trips to xxx and xx, the endless search for xxx, hours spent in the music shop, coffee in xxx, taking photos, helping you move house, pizza and xxx, my birthday in Italy, visiting the Friends set, carrying me when my feet hurt, laughing at our stupid xxxx impressions, and so, so much more. But most of all for the way you loved and cared for me. I will always remember how much fun we had, how much we laughed, how much we ‘got’ each other, and these are memories that I will always keep in my heart.

I’d love to meet up for coffee (or hot chocolate, which I promise I won’t spill this time, haha), so if you’re up for that just let me know - it would be great to catch up and maybe even get to know each other again.

Love X

"I [26F] am in love with my friend [29M] and bought tickets to go visit him - but he is now in a relationship with somebody else...


A long backstory - me [26F] and [29M] met online 5-6 years ago through some mutual friends. We quickly became an odd variation of long distance FWB (as ridiculous as that sounds) and he also visited me a couple of times. Throughout this time we had a lot of issues - he had unresolved feelings towards his ex, I moved to a different country (and it wasn't his, which added to the tension), I was overweight and he wasn't happy with that, he didn't believe a LDR would work or be worth it, I was just out of school and didn't yet have a job, etc... However, despite all of that we really got one another, we had mutual interests, views, opinions. We spoke every day and just in general spent most of our free time with each other. It felt like we had a very unique connection that I personally haven't been able to replicate with anybody else - when it came to us, we could both be completely raw versions of ourselves and we wouldn't judge one another. We could talk about anything and everything.


* Fast forward a few years and we're both adults with stable jobs, we both moved out - due to that we couldn't spend as much time together (conflicting schedules) but we still texted pretty much every day. Eventually I felt like I should move on and not waste my young years waiting for someone who didn't entirely want me and just saw me as an easy way to scratch an itch when he needed some affection or be the fallback girl. However, when I told him I met someone in November he started telling me how much I mean to him (he did this a few years beforehand already...), how now I could finally move in with him and we could build a life together. I know it sounds pathetic, but I was so happy to hear that. It was something I've been craving for so many years, and the option was finally there. I started looking for job opportunities in his country, and I was slowly preparing myself to up-root my life and move. I decided to buy some plane tickets as a Christmas present and plan a trip to his hometown for my birthday in May (where I work holidays get renewed in April, so I couldn't take time off before that).


* Then December rolled around and he started behaving very weirdly. I got very worried, I was concerned it was about my weight or my looks again (despite losing weight and pretty much maintaining a healthy weight for months now), but he then mentioned how him and his neighbour [??F] are super alike - that raised some red flags but I decided to stay optimistic and he reassured me I had nothing to worry about. Except that he kept messaging me less and less... Until I eventually cracked and asked him what the hell was going on. Turns out they kissed and he was falling for this girl now (they're now in a happy relationship). I was irrelevant once again, like every other time another woman showed up in his life.


* It felt like my world pretty much crumbled down. I know it sounds really stupid and naive, but I really do love this man. The weeks we spent together were the best weeks of my life and I can't imagine being with anybody else. I've been an emotional mess since (he told me a few days before Christmas, how nice...) and I've just been really struggling in general. I keep begging him for affection or reaffirmation that he wants me to wait, I am pretty much offering myself on a plate to be a second choice, a rebound... I've been incredibly annoying and I feel exhausted. I don't want to feel this way and I don't want to be pathetic, but for whatever reason I just can't get my shit together. We got into an argument every single time we spoke since Christmas and he flipped the other day and told me he doesn't love me and that he would be happier if I stopped talking to him.


* I also told him about the tickets. He didn't really care, he said he might meet me for coffee, but also thought it would be a good idea to point out his girlfriend might want to come along and that I could meet her... I would really like to see him again. The thought of never seeing him or hearing his voice is something I really don't want to accept. But at the same time... I don't think I could handle it, especially with her being there. Everybody around me is telling me he's doing me a favour, I can finally move on and be happy, but I'm just not sure if I want to or if I'm ready. A part of me just wants to wait for him, but then on the other hand the thought of him and his girlfriend actually makes me feel ill. The tickets are non-refundable and I have accommodation booked already so I'd rather not throw away the money, but what the hell do I do? Do I just go there, install Tinder or whatever they use and just have fun?


**TLDR** - Me [26F] and [29M] have been on and off (romantically and sexually) for the last 5-6 years. We started talking about moving in together in November, but he met his current girlfriend [??F] shortly after - we argued nearly all the time since and are currently not talking. I bought plane tickets to go visit him in his hometown (before he told me about her) and now I'm not sure what to do. The trip is in May and I am a very emotional person, so I think seeing him again would break my heart all over again, but at the same time knowing I will probably never see him again hurts like hell. Should I contact him about it closer to the time or do I use this opportunity to finally let go of this mess?"
"Help


I expected my boyfriend to come home from a party last night around 2am (this is what he told me). I woke up at 5 and he still wasn’t home. I called him and he angrily answered and made some comment about how he had been having a very intimate conversation to this girl (backstory: we were very young when we started dating and he has slept with this girl while we were exclusive but not “officially dating”. We both considered it cheating and decided to move past it. 

The conversation was  about a sexual assault she was a survivor of and how much they’d missed being friends. He had a lot to drink and during this phone call he said that because of the way I felt about this girl, he had lost a very important friendship. I take responsibility for the fact that if I wanted to continue the relationship I had to move on from the cheating and I don’t have a problem with her as it was my boyfriend in the relationship who made the decision to cheat. 

Anyway I told him that I’d like him to come home so we can talk about it and that it was fucking disrespectful to bait me on the phone. He came home and was so cranky and I said to him “don’t be blaming me for your lost friendship. I wouldn’t care if you two were friends if nothing had happened in the first place. It was your choice to cheat with that certain person so don’t look for a scapegoat”. Anyway I’m still torn up about it. He has gone to sleep and honestly there are other issues in our relationship that got brought up during that fight (very heavy drinking and not following through)  but I just need to know that it’s ok to feel angry. 

Sorry for long post"
"I [20m] just broke up with my girlfriend [21f] of 5 years yesterday and I’m so confused on what to do or how to feel


I feel as if I’m looking for somebody to make my decisions for me. I love her, and she would get back with me if I would take her back. A part of me feels like I might never find somebody as kind and beautiful. I don’t know if I should keep it broken off for good, or try to reconcile. 

People around me (including her) pressured me to propose which freaked me out and made me question long term things that I think I may have normally been cool about.

We fundamentally disagree on the use of drugs and me wanting to partake in the usage of cannabis along with her disagreeing about the use of it created rifts in our relationship. I do not need it for medicine, I just find it fun. Her reasoning for not wanting me to do it is that she didn’t want to “date someone like that”. This really struck a nerve with me, as my best friends and myself really are those people and I love them dearly. I don’t like feeling vilified. 

I regretfully revealed some personal things to her, such as telling her that I had tried cigarettes once or twice, which she then seemed to hold over my head or judge me for during light arguments. A part of me feels that I don’t really need somebody who won’t accept me for who I want to be, or somebody who will repeatedly bring up what I consider my personal low points.

When we spent a lot of time together, we would get on each other’s nerves just a little bit. I like some alone time (which is typically when I enjoy cannabis, since she isn’t okay with me doing it around her), but she would always want to spend about all of my free time with her. Feeling a bit smothered, I panicked at the thought of us living together, where I really would not be able to have some breathing room maybe once a week.

Even with these differences, I still love her and feel like we had much easier problems than most relationships experience. After all, I do not believe that there was any manipulation or infidelity between us after five years. I tried to ask if she would be okay with a week-long break just to see where our minds are at afterward, but told her that I understand if she does not want to wait. She seems to be a fan of the idea, but in her few texts she’s sent to me since, she seems a bit scornful which makes me think that maybe I made the right decision. 

I’m sorry for typing so much, but what might you make of all of this? Should I stay or should I go? I miss her so much and feel so broken in this moment of weakness. I’m trying not to be too impulsive.

TLDR; My gf and I are broken up, but I have the opportunity to get her back. Would that be a big mistake or the best choice I could make?

"Husband wants to move back.


So I don't wanna bore you guys with a long story so I am going to give  our '' history'' in a short version.
I live in Belgium, my husband is from England and after doing the long distance relationship thing, he moved to Belgium to be with me.

He found a job after 3 months of living here and he then proposed to me on Christmas eve and got married 9 months later in England.

Now he really doesn't like Belgium, he doesn't like how inefficient everything is, he doesn't like the prices of everything, he doesn't like the people, he doesn't like the anything except the snackbar and the beers :p and I don't mind because  I feel the same way but I don't let it get to me as much as he does. It also different for him since he has nobody but me here. 

He ended op quiting his job and has now a hard time finding a new one and money is ruining tight... 
He is not motivated to get a new job becayse he thinks everything is horrible. He is a developer so I he looked into working from home but no luck so far. 

Now, he has the idea to get a job in England and he would send the money over to help out here but that means my husband is moving back to England and I stay behind. This idea scares me because it is moving backwards. 

I want to move to England but I can't because ei have a son and I can't just take him to England and I will never leave him behind. 

I am scared for our future, I am scared if I say, he can't take a job in England that we will struggle financially ( because we will have to go get money out of our savings starting starting from March)
But I also don't wanna leave apart from my husband... And brexit doesn't give me confidence either cause who knows what is going to happen :(

I have to say he has been sweet and is saying everything will be fine but I don't see much happening, and I also think he doesn't think about it enough. I feel that this situation is so unfair but maybe I'm seeing it wrong. 

I don't  what I expect as a response but my brain is so chaotic atm maybe somebody says something that eases my mind and in the end I could vent a bit as well.

TL:DR: Husband wants to move back to England to help out but I can't go with him. "

"I (24f) hate my BF's (32) dog.


BF and I have been together about 6 months and for the most part, I'm really happy. But there's one point of conflict that I can't seem to shake: his dog. He's had his dog since he was a puppy and he's maybe 5 or 6 now. His dog is a pitbull. Before y'all jump on me for being a pitbull hater hear me out. So when we first started dating I noticed markings all over his face. I asked about them, thinking it was unique coloring. They're scars from multiple dog fights he's been in. BF has assured me over and over again that he wasn't aggressive and they were freak accidents. Ok ok. Fast forward a few months and I like the dog ok. He is whiney and annoying, but not aggressive... until he is. He attacked his roommate's dog, slicing up her lip pretty bad. BF was not there when it happens and assumed roommate was lying about circumstances. Fast forward another month, BF's dog attacks roommates dog again, this time causing the dog to need many stitches. Again, BF assumes roommate somehow triggered his dog. I urge BF to take this issue seriously because this is two bites, increasingly worse, in about a month. In addition, I am growing a little uneasy about being around the dog. I know that there's a difference between dog aggressive and human aggressive, but this dog has a proven track record. I have talked to BF about it, and while he hears me concerns, he is angry that I don't like his dog. We have talked about moving in together and honestly the dog is a huge barrier to this. I think the dog is a threat and a liability. We spend about 50/50 time at one another's houses so I'm with this dog a fair bit, and if we go out of town he always insists on bringing him. Also since the bites, he now asks to bring his dog to my house which makes me uncomfortable because I worry about him biting my dog. How do I approach this situation?!?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: BF's pitbull has been biting other dogs and it's making me uneasy. In turn, BF is butthurt I don't love his dog like he does. Not sure what to do. "
"As soon as someone starts liking me, I start liking them (18F)


I've liked these two people in the past but it eventually faded because I didn't do anything about it.  I found out maybe 6 months ago that one of my best friends told me she has feelings for me and that crush reinserted itself.  My other friend has very recently told me as well that he does, and I think that one is starting to come back up.  I have a boyfriend who I love very much and we've dated for years and I don't want to leave him for anyone but I don't know why this happens.  I know a lot of people stop liking someone if they start returning their feelings.  I feel like a bad girlfriend and I feel like a bad person.  I told the first one I had feelings for as well but I don't plan on doing anything about it because I thought she should know both of these things. For the recent one, I don't want to tell him because I feel bad and he knows how I also like the other one.  But should I tell him the same thing?  I hate myself for this.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR  title pretty much explains most of it, two of my best friends I used to like maybe a year ago have confessed to me recently that they like me, I have a boyfriend and I don't plan to break up with him anytime soon but I've started liking them once more.  I feel like a terrible person."

"Boyfriend (28m) broke? up with me and I’m (24f) confused what happened.


Boyfriend and I are long distance, been together 4 years. He lives in Canada and I the US. 2018 was a rough year, and this year started just as bad for us. He had a tendency to be very controlling and manipulative (that part is confusing) and we started this year by me saying I need time to figure out how to build myself back up and he needs to work on his problems. Up until a few days ago things were actually going well, he was realizing his flaws and I was too and we were working on them.

We have only been texting primarily but talking every few days. Then a few days ago he told me he tried to commit suicide when he was a teenager and it took me back quite a bit. He never told me before, in the span of our relationship he said he was going to kill himself more times I can count. I always took him seriously but sometimes I doubted his motives, so when he told me this in my head I thought all the times he said it he was serious and not being manipulative.

Either way, he thought he told me before but hadnt and for some reason he started freaking out. He started resorting to his old behavior and was being very paranoid. I tried to reassure him I wasnt upset just a bit shocked, he thought I was viewing him differently but I wasnt. 

So today we were texting and I said I have shelves I hadnt put up and I said specifically “Ill just wait to put them up when I get my own place” he knows I wanted to move into my own place in the next few months but dont have the means atm, but for some reason kept asking questions he already knew so i said i didnt want to talk about it anymore.

This started a big idk, argument? and he said he doesnt want to be with me for a few months and I’m truly baffled right now. I did get angry because he wasnt listening to me but he said that him thinking about his depressed past is affecting him a lot and the fact i cant physically be there for him is too much right now and since I have no immediate plans go fix that he’s done for now.

Just a few days ago he knew everything going on with us and was fine and now hes not. I’m confused and very hurt and I want to know if anybody has been in a similar situation? Either on his end of mine.


TL;DR - Boyfriend is dealing with old emotions of feeling suicidal and depressed and broke up with me when I said I wont be getting my own place within the month, or any real timeline. "
"Did I (22F) just become a stalker?


For background, I'm a 22 yo female student. I've never had good luck with dating, as in no man has ever expressed really any interest in me. I have sporadically tried to fix this, and in one of my attempts to form a meaningful relationship I asked another student (\~25 m) whom I really liked out on a date. He didn't really respond, he kinda just changed the subject. Best case scenario, he didn't understand what I was asking; worst case scenario he doesn't like me at all and was terribly uncomfortable. I resolved that the second was more likely and tried to move on. This was about a year ago.

Only I'm very bad at moving on. I think about him all the time, and I know I still have terribly strong feelings for him. About a month ago, I caught him staring at me in the library, which nourished the stubborn hope that he might really like me and made these thoughts and feelings so much more intense. Every time I see him, I get bowled over by these feelings and do weird things, like running away like a child or laughing hysterically for no reason.

These things have been weird and embarrassing, but mostly innocuous. Tonight, though, I think I crossed a line. I saw him leaving the library, and I impulsively decided to follow him home. I didn't do anything weird once he got there and went inside, I just turned around and went home. I was about 1/2 block behind him, and it was dark, so I'm certain he didn't see me. But I feel terrible, like I'm an absolute crazy person who just completely violated his privacy. Worse, I now have the constant impulsion to go back to his house to see him again, and while I can intellectually convince myself that is a terrible idea I'm having a hard time emotionally shoving that notion out of my brain.

TL;DR: I made an impulsive decision to follow a man home. Did I do something really wrong? How can I keep myself from going back to his house?"
"Should I (24F) propose to my (31M) SO?


So my partner and I have been best friends for 7 years (5 of which were in person), in a relationship for 3 years (2 of which were long distance), and living together for a year. 

Our relationship is perfect to me. We communicate really well, make each other laugh, are romantic with each other (but neither of us is a big gestures person, so it's more stuff like grabbing each other snacks while we are out, being mushy with words, and very cuddly). It's good.

For a while now we have talked about getting married, to the point that we have picked out engagement rings, picked a venue, etc. And it hasn't just been me doing these things, he has initated these conversations and been super involved in them. He has never been big on the marriage thing, he is on board with getting married, but he says we are spending our lives together regardless and he doesn't care how it happens, he's a very go with the flow kind of person (with the exception of work, he's super dedicated) who really only wants to make myself and his son happy.
 There are also many legal reasons regarding inheritance, our health, and his son that mean that getting married makes 100% legal sense that we have discussed at length. In addition, I really really want to marry him,  complete with a (very small) wedding and all.

I'm considering that if he doesn't propose on our anniversary next week, or at my uni graduation in April, proposing to him instead. My brother told me that that would be stealing my partner's thunder and I should wait, but we've been discussing it for so long that I feel like it's time. But I don't want him to feel like I'm rushing him or I stole his thunder, so as much as I want to I don't know if I should. Please help me?

Tldr; I want to propose to my partner since he's super go with the flow and I'm scared he won't do it, but my brother says that's stealing his thunder, also I don't want my partner to feel rushed."
"Can the abused be responsible (even partially) for their own abuse?


There is a lot of backstory specific to my situation. The TL;DR is my current fwb told me that I'm ""very easy to abuse"". I don't disagree with him, but that being said, does that mean I'm complicit in my own abuse? Going forward, do I have a responsibility to prevent my own emotional abuse from guys in with? Or is the responsibility to not abuse me solely on them, regardless of how easy I am to abuse?

Several years ago, I (24f) was in a long-term and long-distance relationship with an American guy I was deeply in love with. However, after 5 years together we had grown apart, and I realized I wasn't happy, so I ended things amicably. 

Some time later, I grew closer to another guy, who became a 'friend with benefits' and though my relationship with him, I realized my previous one was extremely problematic and had serious hints of emotional abuse. As an example, my ex would handle any and all conflicts by ghosting me, at times going no contact for several days over things like me falling asleep before texting him goodnight. In addition, any hint of emotion on my part would be hit with accusations of irrationality, and he told me on numerous occasions, he ""won't talk to me until I'm normal again"". He also abandoned me locations during fights (in his country, not mine), and every discussion resulted in him telling me it was my fault because of x. This obviously had a deep impact on me, but I feel I've processed it as well as can be, and came out a better and more rational communicator.

I recently had an argument with my aforementioned fwb (25m) over something pretty small; I had spent the day at his place before heading home for two weeks about an hour after he got back from work, and got frustrated when he chose to spend that hour de-stressing via video games than with me. We handled it rationally; I sat down and expressed that I would have liked more attention, he said he was tired and wanted to destress, and I said I understood and apologized for making a big deal out of something small. At this point, my fwb said ""you know, you are very easy to abuse."" I asked for clarification, and he just gave some examples, but couldn't really define what he meant. 

I don't disagree with my fwb on this matter. I do think I am likely easier to abuse than some women. Specifically, I enjoy being very subservient in relationships, and get off on being dominated, controlled and sexually used. Outside of the bedroom, I enjoy playing a very traditional caretaker role in relationships, which translates into easily to ignoring my own interests. I am aware of this and work on it, but I really do take joy from watching my significant other be happy and helping them pursue their own interests. In addition, I try to be very aware of my own role in disputes. I would rather assume blame than give it, and try to be as understanding and compassionate as possible. 

This leads me to my question; if I really am ""easy to abuse"", does that make it my fault when I am abused? I didn't know that in my last relationship, but am I still in some way culpable for his abuse? Additionally, if I'm not mindful of this going forward and fall into another emotional abuse situation, do I have any blame in the situation? Is it possible for the abused to be culpable in their own abuse or is it always totally the responsibility of the abuser to make sure they aren't abusing? 

Posting this on my alt because I'd like to keep this distanced from my main. Thanks for your advice! I'm as interested in the philosophical discussion as I am in advice on my personal situation."
"Crush (17 M) seems to be withdrawing from me (17 F). I hurt him but I don’t know how to talk to him. Help?


So this guy and I have been into each other for slightly under a year. We have a lot of similar interests and talked quite a bit and I think that’s why we fell for each other. 


Anyways I was hoping he would make a move. I’m OK with waiting because I really like him. He ended up taking quite a while, well into the next school year. This other guy asked me out and since I had a feeling my crush wouldn’t ask me out, I accepted. I dated this other guy for a few weeks. During that time I don’t think my crush knew so he would regularly talk to me. I ended up ignoring him simply because I was taken, but I felt horrible. I broke up with the other guy eventually. 


Anyways my crush found out I was dating this other guy and has pretty much been withdrawing. I have been trying to get his attention, but he’ll ignore me and not even try to look at me. The last time he tried talking to me was when I was dating this other guy and I ignored him. My friends have talked to him and he said he feels “stupid for thinking he had a chance.”I feel terrible and sad over this. However, he also said he still thinks I’m insanely attractive and pretty. I want to talk to him, but he seems closed off, and I’m not good at expressing emotions and I feel like I might cry. What am I supposed to do? 


TLDR Made my crush sad. He’s been ignoring me. What do I do? "

"Intentionally (and regretfully) sabotaging a potential relationship and career...


So bear with me because this will probably be a long one. So a few years ago I was in the military and was assigned to go to flight school. This was all I ever wanted as a kid all the way up to college age so I went to college, graduated, and commissioned into the military. While there I failed out of flight school rather quickly due to my inexperience flying and, in my opinion, a poor training program. 

Soon I was reclassified into a different job I did NOT want (Intelligence). I met a beautiful girl that had recently failed the Intelligence course and we talked and seemed to have everything in common from the state where we were from to our college major. She encouraged me to continue and said that Intelligence was ""a good job"" but I wasn't convinced. She even asked me about wanting kids, which I thought was odd, and I said ""yeah, eventually"". Even told her I was moving off base to a new apartment complex AND she followed me there giving the excuse that it was her ""kind of place"". I thought this was way too coincidental too be true. We went out to a bar with mutual coworkers after finding out she was being reclassified out of Intelligence and she was buying shots for everyone and got sort of drunk. I was moping around at the bar and she came up to me and started flirting with me telling me to ""smile like I'm the prettiest girl in the room"" and ""Intel is a good job"" you know, trying to cheer me up. Later on we ended up goin to a coworker's place where I ended up getting drunk and passing out on the floor. The next morning I woke up and we were talking and I was sitting on the couch when she just laid her head down on my lap and I was like ""wtf"". She said ""sorry"" but I said ""no, you're fine"" and ended up caressing her while talking. We ended up leaving soon after.

Maybe I took it too far after that but when hanging out with some of my coworker friends at my apartment complex she comes over where we are with a new guy that just arrived on base. I was clearly agitated by this but didn't confront her about this until later. The fucked up part comes when I looked into her apartment window after she went back to her apartment room with him and see them full on making out. It made me angry, betrayed, and hurt because I thought we had something. It wasnt until a week later I ask her if I can come over at night and just talk and chill. She said ""yes"" so I go over. We chat a bit then I proceed to tell her I didn't like that she was hanging out with the new guy and that I ""loved her"" (total mistake). She said ""no"" in a really disappointed way and said I was ""sweet"" and then ""delusional"". It hurt pretty bad but I totally freaked out and said I thought she was ""leading me on"" then proceeded to go back to my apartment (because we lived at the same complex). She chases me all the way to my room and I slam the door then text her I ""was just trying to figure you out"" and ""you use people like toys"". Her friend then texted me the next day to leave her alone because she thought I was being creepy. Ended up leaving the military altogether because of this under the pretense I was going to commit suicide because of her. It still bothers me to this day I did that. I truly liked her but intentionally creeped on her obsessively. Any non-judgmental advice for me? Thanks."
"How do I go on with my life now


So I just went through (still am going through) a really hard breakup. Me (16F) and my boyfriend (17M) were dating for just over a year and I finally ended it. It was a super toxic relationship and I was miserable and not treated right. 

Long story short two weeks ago I called it all off. He then never stopped texting me one second saying I love you come back the next saying I hate you. It’s been going on like this since then. 

Except now it’s all winding down and I can’t decide how I feel about it. I know it’s the right thing to do and what I want 100% but it feels weird knowing he’s kind of moving on. 

Though that’s all I’ve been wanting. 

I just don’t know how I’m supposed to go about my life forgetting about him when 1/2 of my school day were in the same classes which I can’t switch out of and we’re in the same after-school activities. 

Any advice? 

Tl;dr I need help moving on from a long relationship"
"Should I [26F] send this angry text to my ex [27M]?


Hi everyone,

I’m [26F] over my ex [27M] romantically but I’m not over the time I wasted on him and how he treated me. Every now and then I get super depressed or sad for the things he had done and I have so much to yell at him about. I’ve been super nice during the breakup and it’s hurting me now. I wanna get all the anger inside me out to fully move on. So do you think it’s a good  idea to send all the things I wanna say in a text and block him for good? 
He blocked me after 1 month then unblocked me 3 weeks ago and texted me back then said he’s here for me. But he’s not here for me! He’s not my friend or bf so he’s just not here for me and that makes me feel like he wants to let the door open for him to go back in case he changes his mind later! 

It makes me feel better when I write the text and not send it but it’s only temporary then i get angry and depressed again. Should I do it and move on?
