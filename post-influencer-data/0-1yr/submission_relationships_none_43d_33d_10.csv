"UPDATE: My [24 F] boyfriend [26 M] of 6 months told me that I need to ""unlove"" the men from my past before I can love him.

Figured I'd update my post from about a month ago. Unfortunately, there wasn't a happy ending, but I am very grateful for a lot of the advice I received here. Thank you, reddit, for helping me keep my head on straight!

After I made my first post, I read all the comments and thought about everything for a few days. A lot of people mentioned that they would not be comfortable with the frequency of my communication with my ex. I thought that was very fair. People also mentioned that Mark's behavior was pretty controlling and not ok. I also thought that was fair.

I went to talk to Mark and told him that I understood if he was uncomfortable with me being in touch with Eli weekly, and that I would be totally willing to cut that down. I also reiterated again that I was not currently in love with Eli and hadn't been for a while. Mark was understanding this time and seemed happy with the fact that I offered to cut down my contact with Eli.

But then I told Mark that although I was willing to do this, I wasn't happy with how he approached the issue and that I found his behavior controlling. I basically told him that I want him to approach issues in a more rational way and I would appreciate if he opened a dialogue rather than just telling me what to do, and that I wouldn't put up with him trying to ""command"" me to do something (especially something so ridiculous). I said everything in the same tone as I used for the first half of the conversation - I wasn't yelling at him or admonishing him, just trying to let him know where my boundaries are.

You guys - Mark. Flew. Off. The. Handle. He started SCREAMING at me. I obviously wasn't having it, so I got up to leave. He started throwing dishes and random kitchen items at me, and grabbed me and slammed my head into the door jam. I ended up with a nasty black eye and a busted lip. Luckily for me, a neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. Mark was arrested and I was taken to the hospital. Yes, I'm pressing charges and filed for a restraining order.

Overall, it was a horrible incident but I'm glad this happened earlier in the relationship rather than later. And I am forever grateful for the neighbor who called the cops. Im also grateful to (most of) you guys for telling me that I wasn't being insane in my first post and for pointing out the early warning signs. It wasn't the best ending, but I'm ok and I'm just glad it's over. Take this as a cautionary tale, I guess!

TLDR: tried to have a rational conversation with Mark, he gave me a black eye and busted lip, it's over (thank God)."
"Girlfriend (25 f) dislikes my (30 m ) relationship with my baby sister (10 f)


I am very close to my baby sister. We share a father, but not a mother. My dad, is kinda a flighty guy. As a result, I’m more of my sister’s dad than he is. I have her so often that I have a two bedroom condo and every house hunting venture lately considers her.

My girlfriend of six months doesn’t like that she’s always at my house, that she has a room, or that I do her laundry. My girlfriend was putting sheets on my bed and there was a pair of my sister’s underwear that fell out of them obviously tangled in the dryer. She lost it. She was saying our relationship is weird and I have to stop having my sister so much. Honestly, that’s not gonna happen. I love that girl, and I’m basically her dad. So I need advice in telling my probably soon to be ex that.

Tl;dr girlfriend is jealous of the time I spend with my little sister and basically insinuates it’s inappropriate. How do I tell her to chill? More importantly, how do I keep her from telling other people that?"
"UPDATE: Boyfriend [25M] wants to break up because I [26F] can't drink


Original post: https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b83384/i_26f_and_my_boyfriend_25m_about_to_move_together/

Long story short, we had a discussion and broke up that week.

Not gonna lie, those first couple months were hard. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and I was totally unsure what to do next. I was torn between sheepishly asking my company to withdraw the transfer, or going ahead and moving alone to what felt like my ex's city. Either way, the clock was ticking on my apartment lease. The anxiety was keeping me up at night and the lack of sleep only made things worse. 

On top of that, it was tough knowing that I was probably the only one sad about the breakup while my ex was living his best life, partying with best friends and banging hot chicks, relieved to be rid of me. So...yeah. That felt like shit.

In the meantime I threw myself into work to keep my mind off things. That's when things took a crazy turn because one of my projects garnered a lot of attention. It led to me writing a report that made its way to a member of upper management. Lo and behold, a few weeks later a management position opened up that I was uniquely qualified for...and the interviewer was that same person who liked my report.

So I got the job! And when they told me that I would need to relocate to our home office in the Bay Area (I work in biotech), I was able to tell them that all my stuff was already packed and ready to go. Thanks, ex!

So now, instead of Dallas, I'll be moving to the Bay Area in a few weeks. One of my best friends is coming along for the ride. We're going to make an epic road trip out of it and hit a few national parks along the way.

Since we had fully expected to move in together, my SO had taken some of my belongings down with him. I've paid about $500 so far to get my shit shipped back. My kitchen stuff and some pieces of furniture are forfeit. He has yet to return my gaming consoles. We really should have split it, but I knew he'd turn that into a back-and-forth that I didn't want to deal with. Tbh, there's also enough of a difference in our budgets that $500 to me is not as big a deal as $250 would be to him. (It's yet another blessing that we never merged our finances.)

I've reminded him a few times about the rest of my stuff and he keeps telling me he'll get it to me. I *really* don't want to have to come down there with a police escort to take back my property, but it's looking like I might have to. I don't know why he has to make this so difficult, but I'm getting pissed. 

So if anyone has any advice to share on that...

I know I'll never know his true thinking, but honestly who cares at this point?

I've also decided I'm not going to try to date for another year at least. I've been told that my management role is likely to be upgraded to a director role, depending on my performance review. So work will probably take up a lot of my time. Any remaining time I have, I want to fully devote to forming friendships. 

But most importantly, if you couldn't already tell, it's clear that I have some serious work to do on self-worth and boundaries.

FTR, I think it's important to note that it's not like this guy was a deadbeat loser. I know it's easy to think, ""Why is this woman dating an asshole?"" when you read these posts, but it's rarely that simple. Everyone who met him loved him. We shared a lot of common interests. He was fun to be around, always happy, great to talk to, supportive of my career, a fantastic cook, very organized, came from a great family, had a good job, all of that.

However, there's no denying that I was in a long-term relationship with someone who consistently took *way* more than they gave. Like, on every level. And he himself would admit that.

I want to take this time to work on myself so that I never accept that kind of situation again.

Buuuuut, when I do decide to put myself out there again, it's the Bay Area. God knows there will be plenty of guys around who also get Asian glow and will understand why I'm not drinking lol

Cheers, everyone! 

**Tl;dr** We broke up. Went through a terrible couple months. Drowned myself in work to cope. Hard work paid off and I landed a major promotion that will take me to the Bay Area instead. Learned an expensive lesson about letting an SO move your things. Hoping he doesn't make me come down there, but I know it's all going to be good in the end. Gonna take the next year to be single and work on myself, but life is looking up."
"[UPDATE] My (20M) friend (22M) wants me to “step aside” so he can date my not-girlfriend (18F)


Original post summary: I have been in an exclusive relationship with (called “L” in post) for over 3 years, but we didn’t use titles (bf/gf). Friend (“K” in post) that knows the history of our relationship asked me to “step aside” so he could try to date L.

[link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckqgjc/repost_my_20m_friends_22m_wants_me_to_step_aside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

I wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond to my post and update anyone who might be interested in the outcome.

I have been staying with L for about a week now, since the initial confrontation with K and thanks to people here, I was sure I wanted to ask her if she wanted to make things more official. She ended up making things even easier for me, as luck would have it. L asked me if it might make things easier if I just told K that she was my girlfriend. I jumped on that opportunity and asked if I could tell everyone she is my girlfriend, and she said yes! She and I are going to look at a few apartments this week, since I obviously need a new living situation, and we want to move in together.

K and I had a few brief discussions after he told me he wanted to be with L. I had told her everything K had said to me, and she was not the least bit interested in him, which I had assumed. I also told him that she is officially my girlfriend now, so that should satisfy his concerns about me not committing to her. He refused to believe any of it without confirmation from her, in person, without me around. She initially agreed to meet with him on Sunday, with the plan that they would meet at her house (since she lives with her mom and stepdad), but he rejected that, saying he wanted to meet at the apartment, without me there. She told him she wasn’t comfortable with that, if he wanted to meet up without me or her parents there they at least had to be somewhere public. He got pissed that his threatening behavior made her feel threatened and went on a tirade, called her every name in the book. She told him she wasn’t going to see him again at all and blocked his number. He has tried reaching out to me a few times ranging from sad to aggressive, and I’m about a text or 2 away from blocking him as well. Hopefully he’ll just move on and it won’t come to that.
Again, thank you to the posters who helped me navigate this situation!

TL;DR- L is now officially my girlfriend and we are going to move in together. K made unreasonable requests when L agreed to discuss their friendship, then blew up at her, so she ended up blocking him."
"I (20F) caught my boyfriend (21M) on tinder


I’m a wreck at the moment. I apologise for any grammatical mistakes or typos.


My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years (celebrated our anniversary this month). Last week I caught him on tinder, I was suspicious because he was acting dodgy on the phone. Usually we’re very open with what we’re doing on our phones, we know each other’s passwords. We go on each other’s phone a lot - not to snoop, ie if I’ve got my phone charging in another room then I’ll go on his, vice versa.


While he was cooking dinner, I had my phone charging so I went on his phone to watch Netflix. He immediately grabbed it and put it in his pocket, asking what I was doing. Then, later that day, while he was driving, he asked me to give our mate a call (happens pretty often when he wants to call someone while driving so he doesn’t have to go on his phone). As I unlocked his phone, he immediately panics and grabs his phone out of my hand.


I was quite suspicious at that time, and I wanted to snoop on his phone. We got home and put a movie on, he was sitting on the couch opposite mine with his phone tilted away from me, I caught a glimpse of his screen and he was on tinder. Fucking tinder, swiping right in front of me.


I blew up and asked what the fuck was he doing. He said he was on there because he was “bored”. We had a massive argument. I asked him to delete the app, he didn’t want to. We went to bed and I was ready to pack my things and leave the next morning. He woke up and said he deleted the app and apologised for hiding it from me. He went on to say that he knows hiding it app from me was really dodgy, but he would never cheat on me, and that he loves me very much. I caved and he made a promise to never hide things from me again. Now that I think about it, he was probably saying that I wanted to hear, but at the time I melted at his words and caved.

2 days later, we were in his car and I wanted to put on some music through his phone. He panicked. He told me to put his phone on the dash. So I did. Later he asked for gps directions so I used his phone. He had tinder on his home page. Fucking tinder again. I asked what this was about. Same fight again.

I’m in bed next to him wondering what to do. I think I know what to do but I’m a mess at the moment. I know I should leave. He says he loves me, why would he do something like this if he loves me.

TL;DR Bf was on tinder, we fought and he promised he’d delete the app. Caught him on tinder again."
"Update: What to do about my (18) brother (23) and his toxic fiance (22)

"An update on a post from 7months ago about my partner's (f27) depression and its impact on my (M27) life.


7 months ago I posted about my girlfriend, her struggles with depression and how it was impacting my life and my personal needs. I got some really helpful and empathetic replies which I was really thankful for. Post can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aajrls/my_depressed_partner_27f_and_the_effect_it_has

I wanted to write abit of an update, partly for those who helped but also to show that it can sometimes get better. 

A couple of months back my partner was due to get her contraceptive coil removed. She struggled with irregular periods whilst on the coil so she decided that she didn't want a replacement and wanted to get back to a normal cycle. 

Honestly, her mood changed almost immediately. It was so quick. As soon as it was out, she started feeling better. Her want to do fun stuff has returned, and the sex drive is slowly increasing. We have already had wayyyy more sex in 2019 than we did in the whole of last year. 

She is now off meds, and even though we are going through stressful times (moving house man... NEVER AGAIN!!!!), Her moods recover to a norm far quicker.

We do more family stuff now. I'm typing this from a camping holiday together, and my stepdaughter is doing well at home and at school, bringing home a brilliant report for the end of the school year.

I don't want this post to come across as bragging. I just wanted to point out that it seemed that the cause of my partner's illness was a hormonal imbalance that was exacerbated by her contraceptive coil? I'm unsure of the science behind that but we are certainly doing better. 

Thank you to all those who helped our situation before. 

TL;DR My partner struggled with depression until her contraceptive coil was removed. Our lives have improved alot since. Thank you to all those who helped and commented!"
"I (23f) called cps on my Mother (~50f) to check on the welfare of my younger siblings. My eldest sister(30f) freaked out and says I was out of line. I have had anxiety all day about it. Was I overstepping? Should I have kept my mouth shut?


I dont want to go into a ton of detail. The ""need to know"" is I have been out of the home the last 7 years, and during this time my two siblings have lived there still. 
While I was in the home, we were mentally and physically abused by our stepfather.  We lived in trashy houses that were covered in actual garbage, including animal feces,  and just stuff EVERYWHERE. 
I havent heard from my youngest sister since May. I am pretty sure she has been told to cut contact with all of us (us being her older siblings). My second to youngest sister is overweight with spinal issues and is supposed to be dieting and seeing a specialist that they do not take her to see. 

I told the social worker that I wanted a check up on them because if previous deplorable conditions, and because I am not sure about any physical or mental abuse still happening in the home. It genuinely concerns me. I told them what happened with us (slammed into walls, things thrown at us, cussing, belittling our character... etc....) And told them repeatedly I really just want to know my little siblings dont have the same living conditions we had. 

My husband supported me through the call, and agreed it was the right thing to do. My siblings all discussed it ahead of time with the exception of my eldest sister who moved out before things got bad and the two who live in the house. We all agreed it would at the very extreme least let them know that they were being watched and we didnt just give up on them... and maybe my Mother and SD would keep a clean house, clean nose etc..

CPS contacted my mother very quickly.  Much faster than I anticipated. I mean within 3 hours.
Following this my eldest sister who lives states away and hasnt contacted me in months calls and shes freaking out on me because she ""knows Im the one who called"". I denied nothing and simply said, ""If they have nothing to hide, then they dont need to worry. Itll be over and done with pretty quickly "" to which she replied ""And if it isnt? If theyre taken away?"" I said ""Hopefully it doesnt come to that, and if it does it isnt on me. I didnt maltreat them. I didnt spread animal feces through the house. If they are clearly neglecting them, why should they have to stay in the house?"" I asked ""Would you let your children live like we did?"" She didnt answer.  I asked again, and she said ""No. Id keep a decent house but its not your job to tell someone else how to parent"".  I said ""Okay. So if this is all you called about, I think we're done here"". She told me we all needed to ""Get over what happened to us and move on with our lives!"" (She moved out long before the abuse started and wasnt around for any of it)

Regardless of my personal experience, I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. I have limited to no  contact with my Mother because of her husband, and she denies any abuse ever happened to any of us... My sister asked ""Why dont you just pop in and see the conditions?"" I told her ""I cant be around (my stepfather). I refuse to subject myself to that negativity again"" 

 While by husband and siblings agree it was the right thing to do... I still can't help feeling wrong for it.... like it ""wasnt my place"". But if it wasnt my place, whose was it? 
I really would like a third party outside opinion about what I did. 
Am wrong for reporting my family? Honestly, should I of just kept my mouth shut?


I don't mind having no contact with my Mother or eldest sister.  They dont even know Im nearly 4 months pregnant because of how very very little we talk as it is.  So the potential of never really having a relationship doesnt bug me really. What bugs me is not knowing if I was in the right. 


TL;DR
I called cps on my mother based on previous experience with being abused mentally and physically from our step father. I havent heard from my younger siblings in a while because communication had been cut. We lived with deplorable conditions, animal feces, garbage and clutter everywhere, being hit, having things thrown at us, etc. I told cps that I wasnt sure if anything was for sure happening still because again, we dont have contact, but that I wanted them to check on my siblings.  Was I totally out of line?"
"Me (27/M) and my boyfriend (24/M) were beaten up in a homophobic hate crime and ever since things just haven't been the same. We need help.


So we had gone on holiday to visit a country and I'm not going to go into the details because I don't want to relive it. It's in my post history if you're curious. But we had been like two peas in a pod before it happened, after it happened things have been... difficult.

Just this morning we went for brunch, and

1) when we were ordering, he ordered a burger, then I ordered a burger and a drink, then he got a side and when the waitress left he snapped at me that I had cut across him.

2) my bag fell over and was in the aisle, I hadn't noticed it. When I was going to the toilet he said ""babe your bag"" and I was like oh yeah and kicked it back to my seat. When I was going back to the toilet he called after me ""we're in a restaurant you can't just block the aisle"". Passive aggressive.

3) when I returned our empty trays had been taken. He told me my phone had been on my tray but it was now on the table. I thanked him, but he said ""I was gonna let her take it, you have to learn"". I don't get it, completely unnecessary.

When we were walking to my busstop to go to work I called him on his behavior and he said I'm disorganised and that he needs a boyfriend, not a child, and that he's not my dad. Then he said ""this morning has been a disaster"" and walked off before my bus had even arrived. He never even thanked me for paying for brunch.

I don't know what to do, he didn't used to treat me this way. I can't take this treatment but I'm at a loss. Please advise.

TL;DR: Ever since we got beaten up for being gay, my boyfriend has started treating me differently. He has no patience with me and he constantly snaps at me. I don't know what to do."
"My Girlfriend (24/f) pushed me (21/m) into a wardrobe and refused to let me leave. (Almost 1 year relationship)


 

I have been with her for just under a year. A few days ago we had an argument because I was in a bad mood because I couldn't walk on my leg properly as I had injured it due to my physically demanding job. I tried to make up for it by offering to go to the store, getting us some snacks to watch a movie later. I even said she could pick out a plant because she really likes them and she blew up at me because she had been asking me to buy her flowers for ages and now I'm offering her some in order to ""bribe"" her.

She went to the bedroom and I fell asleep at the kitchen table (I work from 12 to 9pm) because I was so tired. I went to bed and the next morning was getting ready for work again at 10am. As I'm about to leave she asks if I will say anything to her, and I said I don't want to argue before going to work. She then proceeds to ask me why I don't make an effort on her anymore because I never buy her flowers. I think I do make an effort.. I spend around 700 on her birthday a few weeks ago, I buy groceries and try to take her out when I have money.

I tried to leave and put my shoes on but she went behind me, pushed me away from the door into the wardrobe and snatched my trainer out of my hands. She honestly looked unhinged and I just stood there shocked, she knows my family were abusive towards me and then can so easily shove me like that. I just calmly asked for my shoes back, whilst trying not to cry and she just said ""take them back from my hands, then we'll both be scared"".

I didn't go near her and she just drops the shoe and goes to the bed crying. I hugged her and calmed her down then went to work.

Last night was the same story, I was completely drained from work. crawled into bed after buying more groceries for her and being in the kitchen talking for a bit. I was half falling asleep when she said my name and then ""you don't want to talk?"". She then proceeds to have the same conversation about how I don't make effort and literally bullet points how shit I am.

I snapped a bit and said how can someone you love just sit there and count off all the things that are so shit about you? She then went on a 10 minute rant about how unhappy she is and how I don't make any effort. She went to work this morning and it's my day off. I want to leave her but I'm scared.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - my girlfriend pushed me and I'm scared of how far this will go, how do I leave safely?"
"My girlfriend (28f) is annoyed that I (29f) don’t want to move into a luxury $4800 1 bedroom apartment even if she would be paying for most of it


We’ve been together 3 years and are fighting over this. We are moving in together in a few months. We live in the Bay Area where rent is ridiculously high.

For context, she earns at least 4x more than I do (we haven’t openly shared salary but it’s somewhere in that ballpark). I’m an elementary school teacher, she works in tech. She has a degree from Yale, has a significant amount of money saved up, and is what you would typically define as very successful. I, on the other hand, am still trying to build up my savings after paying off grad school loans.

My girlfriend is normally a frugal person, but she wants to move into a $4800 per month luxury-style 1 bedroom apartment that her heart is set on. The apartment is very nice, yes, but it’s also a LOT of money for rent and I don’t feel comfortable spending that much money for rent. It seems extravagant and fancy which is surprising, considering my girlfriend is usually extremely practical and frugal. 

Her argument is that she’s worked very hard to get to where she’s earning what she currently makes, and she wants to live in a really nice place. She says she’ll pay both our rent so I don’t have to worry about money. For obvious reasons, I am very uncomfortable with this and told her so. She says it’s fine, I should just pay  my current rent where I’m living right now with roommates and she’ll pay the rest. 

I’m still uncomfortable with this and voiced it to her. She doesn’t get where I’m coming from at all and she’s very frustrated. (And we’re both stressed because we don’t have much time to find a place to move in to). Things have gotten heated and a couple of hurtful things were said:

- We went to tour an apartment that I found online that I think is a more reasonable price. Of course, it was not nearly as nice as the one she wants to move in to (for example no AC or hot tub). Throughout the entire tour, she was completely disinterested and aloof and seemed annoyed at me the whole time and in a bad mood. On the way to the car, she made a joke about how she hadn’t anticipated living like a college student again in her late 20s. That felt incredibly demeaning. 

-  She made an off-hand comment about how if she were straight, she would date one of her coworkers who is a millionaire and they would buy an island. She was joking, but still. I called her out on it and she immediately apologized and said she was out of line. 

- during one of our fights over this, she mentioned that being with me is feeling like she has to sacrifice her quality of life because I’m too stubborn and prideful. She’s often sarcastic when she’s upset and she said in sarcasm that in the future we should just go on separate vacations as well then and live in separate houses and have separate furniture, etc. I think it was an extremely petty and hurtful thing to say. 

- The final straw: we were in the car getting gas today and there were two stations. I drove to the closer one, even though the other one was 4 cents cheaper. My girlfriend made a remark about how come we’re not going to the other station if it’s cheaper? I thought she was referencing to the apartment situation and I blew up at her and ended up breaking down into tears. Not my greatest moment. The amount of stress I feel right now with trying to find an apartment before my lease ends is unreal. Long story short, I went home and told her I need space away from her. We haven’t talked since then though she’s texted me a long apology. Our plan was to decide on an apartment by the end of this weekend. 

With all this said, I feel so lost and confused about what the right move in this situation is. I can’t tell if I’m being stubborn and prideful over this or if she is not respecting my wishes. I also feel like I should call her out on some of the hurtful sarcastic things she’s said (though she already apologized for them in the text message) because though we rarely fight, she has a tendency to resort to sarcasm as a defense mechanism when we do, and I hate it when she does that.

At this point, maybe we should just not move in together? But if this doesn’t get resolved now, then will it ever?

TLDR; girlfriend earns more than 4x what I do, she wants to move into a $4800 apartment that I can’t afford, and has been sarcastic about me not wanting to"
"My Boyfriend(25/M) Has Gotten Incredibly Wealthy, And Now I’m(23/F) Insecure About How Much Attention He Gets


Some context, I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and at the beginning, he didn’t have much, he came from a poor family but he was an incredibly hard worker. He was working on his own business. I loved him so it wasn’t a big deal, to be honest, the fact that he was ambitious and so hard working was a gigantic turn on even though it wasn’t making him much.

Over the last year, long story short, it has exploded and he’s made a ton of smart investments and now he’s pretty much went from having very little, to being a millionaire. It’s amazing and I’m so proud of him, but at the same time, I’d be lying if I wasn’t getting a little insecure. Now I work too, but at this point he has lapped me so many times over, but what really makes me insecure is how much attention he gets.

Many in our social circle have come to realize his success, and specifically he gets a ton of female attention. Like women are literally all over him and if I’m being perfectly honest, the majority of them are way better looking than me. I know looks aren’t everything, but it’s hard not to get insecure about this.

It’s not his fault at all, he just got really successful, he takes care of his body, of course he’s going to get a lot of female attention. He’s also constantly reassured me that I’m the one and he’ll constantly tell me “he did this for us so we can have a better life”. I even mentioned a long time ago that I wanted to go to Puerto Rico, this was like 18 months ago and on my birthday he surprised me and booked a trip for us to go for 4 days and nights and he payed for everything. Yes it was a lot of money, but moreso the fact he remembered something I said so long ago was amazing to me.

Basically what I’m saying is NONE OF THIS IS HIS FAULT. This is an internal insecurity that I have to deal with, but I’m having a hard time figuring out how. Any advice would be appreciated.

TL/DR boyfriend of 2 years went from having very little to being a millionaire, he gets a lot of female attention and it’s making me incredibly insecure. How do I cope with this?"
"My (F28) dad (M57) is starting to have hallucinations due to his brain cancer. Do I entertain them or nip them in the bud?


I hope this is okay to ask here. I wasn't sure where else to go. 

January of this year my dad was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme. The life expectancy from diagnosis is typically very short, as it grows very quickly. His tumor didn't respond to treatments and we've just been kind of riding it out and keeping him as comfortable as possible.

It honestly looks like we're nearing the end of the battle. His symptoms are getting worse and more aggressive, but the newest one is he's having vivid hallucinations. From what he can communicate (it's limited), none of them seem bad or scary (I haven't personally been present when they've happened yet, my mom relays the information). But my question is when he starts reacting to a hallucination, do I shut it down in an attempt to keep him grounded here in reality? Or should I indulge them and let him just roll with it? Like today he told my mom he saw a ""blue puppy jumping around the bedroom."" should we just treat it like a toddler playing pretend? ""oh? What's the puppy's name? Did it have a cute collar?"" 

I've never had to deal with anything like this. This has been the hardest experience of my life and I can't imagine how scary and awful it must be for my dad. So I don't know if it's better to just let him have his blue puppies, or try and keep rewiring his brain to see reality. Would letting the hallucinations get carried away cause him to slip away from us faster (mentally I guess), or should we just accept they're going to happen regardless and they aren't hurting him? I just don't want him to be scared or worried. Right now they're fine so it seems okay to be like ""yeah sure blue puppies are rad huh"" but what happens when he sees something fucked up and we try and explain that it's okay it isn't real after we've been supposedly seeing shit with him this whole time? 


Tl:dr: dad's brain cancer is causing hallucinations. Do I shut them down or entertain them?"
"Fiancé (32M) bought a fixer upper house, I (33F) find myself literally hating it after a week of renovation and wondering if we are compatible.


I can feel myself torpedoing my relationship as I write, pls help.

I suppose a little back story is needed. When I met my fiancé we were both working in the local big city. He was living a 15 min train ride outside the city while I lived in the city and loved it. I have lived in major cities my whole life, while he grew up in a small town. I moved in with him eventually into his super nice rented apartment outside the city and found myself loving it- a short walk to a vibrant small city artsy community, steps to the local excellent train station etc. eventually fiancé quits stressful consulting job in the city and takes a much less stressful job in another small city maybe 25 min by train from big city. All continues well, we get engaged and decide given our ages that we’re ready for a family. 

A few weeks after we find out I’m pregnant he excitedly comes to me and tells me he found a perfect house for us in the small city where he is now working. I’m a little taken aback, I’ve never even thought of a house but am open to the idea.  I have a miscarriage which was bad and traumatic in ways I’m still processing, but the house process inexorably continues on. I see the house for the first time 2 days after the D&amp;C and am understandably I guess in kind of a bad mood but I do my best. On the car ride home I tell my fiancé I have reservations but I can see he is in love with the place. Also it’s his and his parents’ money- I’m still paying off student loans and not in a position to buy. So I give my go-ahead, which is on me I know.

My reservations- first of all it’s in straight up what feels to me small town life. All the neighbors know each other, there’s no real arts community like in our old town, there are stores to walk to but it’s along a busy road, I will need to bike or drive (I have no license but my fiancé has a car) to get to the train station. The yard and everything is nice but dear lord I can already see it’s going to be a colossal lot of work that I am absolutely not into at this moment. We just took a full week off work to renovate the ground floor and it was brutal hours of manual labor with umpteen of his friends and family constantly around. I feel more and more distant from my fiancé every day as he’s visibly so excited by how it’s turning out (which I had 100% input into) and I just don’t really care. Every morning as time goes on and we drive to the house in the morning I feel an existential pit of dread in my stomach, and now these last few days I’ve started breaking down in the car. He’s being so patient and understanding and offered to sell the place, but it’s too late for that I know, I need to suck it up and give the place a chance. But I can see years of home renovation like this looming and it’s just killing me. Why couldn’t we have stayed in an apartment?

Right now I’m huddled upstairs listening to him and his dad renovate downstairs and off and on crying all day while waiting for his friends to come over tonight for a construction dinner party and I can barely hold it together. It doesn’t help that we’ve never been alone really this week. I find myself fantasizing about renting an apartment on my own in the local city, even though I was 200% happy with him before this. This is ridiculous I know. Please help me figure out how to handle this, how to talk to fiancé about my fears about living in a small town, how to overcome my complete aversion to home owning?!?

TLDR: reluctantly agreed to moving to a new house and am finding myself hating it before we even move in. How can I overcome this and give it a fair shot?"
"My (22 M) boyfriend (20 M) wants me to help him pay his bills, but he doesn’t make payments and spends on new designer clothing


My boyfriend and I have been together for over three years. We live in an apartment that comes with its own parking space, but since we each have our own car, one of us needs to use the building’s valet service. The valet service is $230 a month. 

For the first year we lived in the building, I used the free space and my boyfriend used the valet. Every time rent was due, I always sent him $115 to help him pay for the valet without even thinking about it. I viewed this as a shared expense. 

Ever since we renewed our lease, we switched things up and now I use the valet service and my boyfriend parks in the free space. For the first few months, he sent me $115 as well, but recently he asked me if I could cover the entire $230 because he has to catch up on his toll road debts that exceed $700. The route I take to work doesn’t use any toll roads, so I agreed to cover the valet fees for a month to help him out. 

In addition to the valet, I also paid for half of my boyfriend’s AirBnB ($80) when he went to visit his family last weekend, and I have also covered all of our streaming services since we’ve lived together.

Rent is almost due, and so I asked my boyfriend if he could send me $115 for the valet. He told me that the valet “isn’t his problem” and that he still has hundreds of dollars of debts that he needs to catch up on. I asked him how much his last payment was, and he said $75. Meanwhile, he came home from a shopping trip yesterday where he spent almost $150 on new shoes. 

I want to help my boyfriend and I want our expenses to be equal, but I just can’t help but feel like I’m being taken advantage of. On top of all that, my boyfriend earns more money than I do! By covering his half of his valet expenses to “help him catch up on his debts,” it feels like I’m actually just buying him new shoes. 

So, do y’all think I’m overreacting? Should I just take a deep breath and let this go, or should I put my foot down and tell him that he needs to help me?

TL;DR: My bf won’t help me pay for our valet service because he says he needs to pay down his toll road bills, but he barely makes payments and spends on needless indulgences."
"My (17F) brothers (15M) locked our soon to be step brother (8M) outside in a storm. Dad thinks I was involved and dad (46M) has gone nuclear.


My dad is dating Chelsea (40F) who has Damien (8M) as her only kid. Chelsea and my dad have been dating for 2 years. Chelsea is a paramedic and she was asked to work a little later than usual one night. She wasn't sure what time she'd be home, and just asked if Damien could stay with us until she got off work. My dad agreed and that was that. Damien mostly kept to himself because he doesn't know us that well. 

My dad went to go get dinner. I was upstairs in my room when he left. When he got back I heard what I thought was yelling. I took my headphones out and all I heard was my dad cursing up a storm. I went downstairs to see what was happening. He made a comment that the princess decides to join the commoners or something to that effect. He asked me why he can't leave Damien with me and my brothers for 20 minutes. He was asking me if I'd like to explain why Damien was soaking wet when he got home and shivering outside. My brother's tried to explain that they were just messing with him and they didn't mean it. Dad just kept yelling every time one of us opened our mouths. 

Chelsea chewed my dad out when she got there. She just put Damien in the car and left when she was done. 

My brothers are idiots and I think what they did was stupid. But I had nothing to do with it. Dad has gone nuclear and I don't know what to do because this is the most serious he's been about punishment in ages. 

TL;DR: Dad's gone nuclear with punishment."
"S/O of man who does labor job taking a toll on me


My [f25] boyfriend [m29] works in construction/ concrete/ roads. He works from 4am-7 PM, sometimes later 6 days per week. But, the hardest part is his attitude during the work season (off during winter, can't pour concrete). 

I know he's tired. I know he's sore and broken. He's the hardest worker I've ever met. He's a boss, so that pushes him even more. He works way too much and way too hard. He won't slow down. He's already been doing this for 12 years, so he's very physically broken. He does everyone's job while they stand around, eat, smoke, whatever and he barely takes a break for a sip of water. 

He won't listen to slow down and show the company nothing will get done without him. So, the worst part is his attitude. ""Fck this guy. Fck that job."" Its exhausting listening to constant negativity. But I cant really bring it up because he is valid to feel that way. Also, he is the breadwinner, which I know isn't exactly an excuse, but basically hes breaking his back every day for us and it sounds kind of selfish or unappreciative to complain about...his complaints. 

In the winter, hes always happy. It sucks to see him like this because overall, even during the season, hes a big jokester and very positive/upbeat. I think it's hard for me because he won't listen to slow down and brings some of this upon himself. But it's not worth arguing. 

Any advice on how to deal with this? Btw we've been together 3 years.

Tl;dr boyfriend and breadwinner literally breaking his back minimum 12 hours a day 6 days a week. Valid in feeling tired, sore, frustrated, but it's hard for me to listen to constant negativity especially without sounding unappreciative."
"My [26/F] newlywed husband [25/M] and I are in therapy because after three years of dating and claiming he wanted kids as soon as we could have them, he dropped a bombshell that he didn’t know if he ever did want them. Our therapist hasn’t been helpful.


My [26/F] newlywed husband [25/M] and I are in therapy because after three years of dating and claiming he wanted kids as soon as we could have them, he dropped a bombshell that he didn’t know if he ever did want them. Our therapist hasn’t been helpful.


My husband and I both shared dreams of having three children because we were each from a family of two and had both longed for a third sibling. We both agreed we wanted to get started in our twenties. We both agreed we didn’t want to wait until our mid thirties like his parents or forties like his uncle and aunt. He would always tease them about it but there was also truthful judging to the teasing.


He was always so good with my brother’s young children. He said he wanted our kids to be close in age. My sister-in-law just had a baby and we’ve been married a year and were about to close on a house when he told me he didn’t want the house anymore. We lost $3,000 that my parents gave us to put down as a deposit because he waited four days until closing to tell me this. He got emotional and said he worried that he is ruining my life because he doesn’t know if he ever wants kids now, because he wants freedom to stay up late playing video games or going to the casino to play poker whenever he feels like it. This was so out of left field that I freaked out. He used to tell anyone any chance he could “My wife and I aren’t stopping until we have a boy!” And I would lovingly and jokingly say “maybe at 5 kids we will stop”. He used to press me to honestly consider FOUR kids and I convinced him that THREE will be enough!


He acted like we were breaking up, saying “we will miss each other at first but it will get better”. I moved to his home state for him because he wanted to be near his family. I started crying and to be honest, while we have been fighting lately, it was never about kids. He said he wanted us to get pregnant once we got into our house. But now he was taking away a house and children from me. I got out my laptop and started looking to see if my company had my position in any other state closer to my family. When he realized what I was doing, he asked me to put it away. He laid in bed and held me and then decided he wanted to work on us in therapy and rent an apartment. Suddenly he changed from “I don’t know when or if I ever want kids” to “I do want kids with you, of course I do, but we need to fix our problems first”.


Yesterday was our third session and we did single sessions. I went in first by myself. The therapist asked me “Why do you want children so bad right now?” I told her I have just always wanted them. She continued pressing me, and saying “Do you think they will fix your marriage?” I told her that’s not why I want kids... I told her I have always wanted kids and my gynecologist recently said it’s best and healthiest to have them in their twenties, which was what my husband and I were on track for anyway but then he changed his mind and I feel like I’m running out of time. She said “you’re 26? Well I didn’t have...oh wait, I had all my children by age 26. Don’t listen to me. Don’t listen to me.” I just stared at her, my eyes filling with tears. She said “Well I mean have you heard about the woman having a baby at 67? Anything is possible?” I stared again. Then she said “oh well you don’t want to have kids at 67, I’m sure...” 


I felt awkward and didn’t want her to feel bad because she was clearly doing a terrible job...so I said “Well yeah Megan Markle had a baby at 37...”


“I know, right? I was so shocked when they announced that.”


I was stunned at her response. Absolutely stunned. Here I was, crying because I’m 26 and childless and my husband who adored children suddenly doesn’t want them..and my therapist was making me feel worse.


She then said I need to stop bringing kids up for a month and then we will revisit it, and only bring them up around her in a month. 


She also asked me if having NO children was a dealbreaker. I said yes because while I do love him, I’m not willing to give up my chance to have babies and I feel like I’m running out of time because if we don’t work out, I’ll need to find someone else. I mean what he’s done to me is horrible...I never would have married a man who didn’t want kids, and he said he wanted them as soon as possible, lots of them, and everyone saw how good he was with my nieces and nephew...As much as I love him, if he hadn’t been interested in kids, we wouldn’t have dated for 3 years or gotten married.


**tl;dr** My [26/F] newlywed husband [25/M] and I are in therapy because after three years of dating and claiming he wanted kids as soon as we could have them, he dropped a bombshell that he didn’t know if he ever did want them. Our therapist hasn’t been helpful. What should I do?"
"My (33) husband (35) refuses to help around the house


I've got so many things that are weighing on me, but I'm going to stick to the most recent things.   


I'm 8 months pregnant. I'm at that point where it's difficult to breathe while mopping the floor. Throughout the pregnancy I've maintained the home as best as I can while he works. I also work. I'm basically holding down three jobs - one I get paid for, one I don't, and the other is basically someone sucking the life out of me for 9 months (it's been difficult, but I'm excited to be a parent!). 

If I don't clean, it won't get done. Dishes? Nope, they'll sit there for over a week until I find gnats and flies buzzing around the kitchen. Laundry? He'll wear everything he owns and then simply wear dirty clothes with no underwear.  Cat litter boxes? Takes about 60 seconds to scoop them, but he can't be bothered even when I directly ask him to do it for me. Eventually the cat boxes got so dirty they started shitting on the floor, which is carpet and needed to be scrubbed clean. He knew they cat shit was on the floor but wouldn't pick it up and wouldn't clean the carpet. He also owns rabbits, which would have literally suffered from starvation and dehydration until they died if I didn't make sure they have food and water. He also refuses to clean the cages, even when I directly ask him to do it for me. At one point, he said he would do it and two weeks later I found maggots, flies, gnats, and a horrible rotting smell because he hadn't bothered cleaning the cages. When I've pointed out that we need to find homes for the rabbits, he refuses to even discuss it.   


And the kicker this morning - he owns that he doesn't interact with. If I don't take her out to potty she'll shit and piss all over the house. I'm the one that exercises her. I'm the one that makes sure she has food and water. This morning I woke up to her whining and he was awake and screamed, literally screamed, at her to shut the fuck up. This happened three times, and he refused to get up and let her out. She doesn't whine in the crate unless she needs to potty. He knows this. I heard her whining again and before he could scream at her a fourth time, I got up to let her out. I found that she'd shit and pissed in her crate and stomped/possibly laid in it because it looked like it was all over her ribs and belly and legs. I gagged from the smell. I let her out, told him she'd messed in her crate, and went back to bed. Two hours later he got up, got dressed, and left for work. He left the dog mess for me to clean up.   


I'm at the end of my rope. I cannot tolerate living in a house so filthy there are maggots and flies and gnats buzzing around while I dodge landmines from the cats and dog. I cannot tolerate knowing that animals will die a horrible, painful death if I'm not the one to take care of them. It'd be very easy to find them homes or surrender them to a shelter, but he won't hear of it.  


Now the thought is in my head 'I'm going to have to do all of this, hold down a job, and take care of a baby all on my own because he'll just lay there in bed pretended to sleep and scream at his daughter for crying because she needs a diaper change or because she's hungry.'  
I don't care if he's depressed. This is fucking ridiculous and real animal abuse. I don't want to hear excuses for him, or from him. I need some really good ideas on how to tell him that I am done, that I will not be catering to him any longer, and that if we don't come to some kind of resolution and he doesn't figure out what the fuck is going on with him, he will lose me and the baby. I deal with my own mental health issues as best as I can with the limited amount of pregnancy safe medication that I can take. I know exactly how difficult mental health issues can be to deal with, but what I will not tolerate is being treated like a slave, watching animals suffer, or wondering how on gods green earth I'm going to manage basically being a single parent when I should be able to rely on my partner.   


Tl;dr : Husband has seemed to take for granted that I will take care of everything while also working and being pregnant, and hasn't lifted a finger to help out around the house and leaves me wondering if I'd be better off actually being a single parent rather than having to deal with the crap he's putting me through."
"Husband (32M) Hates my (25F) New Hair Color


My husband and I have been together for almost 8 years, married for a little over 2. 

My husband has a lot of opinions about hair and likes it best when I keep it long and dark. I’ve changed it before and it ended up causing arguments so I’ve kept it natural for the last few years. 

I decided get my hair highlighted and have some pink put in at the bottom. We discussed that I was getting my hair done briefly but he didn’t seem worried about it so I thought all was good. 

Well, I got it done a couple days ago and I love it! I called him on the way home to tell him about it and when I mentioned the pink he freaked out and hung up on me. 

We didn’t speak for the rest of the day and the next morning he sent a bunch of angry texts saying the new hair makes me look gross and fat and that I know he likes dark hair and must have changed it to make him upset. He told me that he can’t stand to look at it and that I need to either change it or leave until it goes back to normal. I refused to leave and he told me if I don’t leave he will file for divorce. 

We talked in person about it and he basically begged me to change it and I requested that we see a counselor together. He said he would go but only if I changed my hair first. That I should change it to save our marriage and that if not he will have to divorce me because I won’t leave and he can’t be around me like this. That my hair is a big part of what makes me attractive to him and now he’s not attracted to me and that we should have discussed it more beforehand. When I left he said he will be contacting a lawyer. 

Honestly I’m super floored that this is happening. This does not feel real. I feel that he is being controlling and I’m not sure what to do. Should I continue trying to talk and work things out? Is there anything I should be doing at this point? Should I just leave? I’m so embarrassed to even tell my family so I can stay with them for a while. 

TL;DR: I changed my hair color and my husband hates it. He is threatening divorce if I don’t change it."
"My parents (60M, 57F) offered and convinced me (28M) to let them pay for an expensive surgery and changed their mind after the procedure.


Hello Reddit, 

I’m just going to jump in: I broke my wrist in April during my final finals week of my undergrad. It was an accident at home and entirely my fault. At first, I thought it was a really bad sprain, but it seemed obvious to almost everyone else that it was broken. Unfortunately, for me and my wife, it wasn’t a question of whether I should see a doctor, but whether we could scrounge enough money for the visit. 

The day after I broke my wrist was Easter. My extended family always gets together for a large meal on holidays, this time it was at my grandparents’. My dad didn’t come because he was sick, but my mom was there and asked what happened to my wrist. During the conversation she urged me to go to a doctor and I explained that we really couldn’t afford it. Without hesitation my mom said she and my dad would cover the costs. My dad makes a looooot of money, but both my parents grew up poor and they’re usually super weird about giving their kids money—like, they sent my brother and his wife on a trip to Israel on their dime, but made my sister go door-to-door selling candy bars to come with them to Europe (we’re in the US). Yes, favoritism is certainly a factor in how they decide to spend their money on their kids, but it’s never been an issue with important things like medical bills or school. So, after some convincing (because I don’t love handouts), I agreed. It’s important to note here that I had to leave work early (manual labor) the day I broke my wrist and called in on Easter. Before I went to Easter dinner, my manager explained that the company we work for, which is corporate, notes when supervisors miss work two days in a row without proper coverage (manager who is salaried had to cover both shifts) and requires a doctor’s note in order to return to work. So, my mom’s offer seemed to be the only way I could continue working.

I went to a doctor the next day. Spoiler: it was, indeed, broken. Specifically, the scaphoid bone (I won’t give a lesson, but if you look it up you’ll see this a particularly tricky bone to heal—slightly relevant). I was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and after visiting the ortho, I called my dad to relay the options the surgeon laid out for me: I could a) opt for a cast, spend a minimum of 6 months in it before they do a check up and—the surgeon stressed—the six month minimum was just that, a minimum, and it would be closer to a year before I had the cast off. In that time I would not be allowed to work my manual labor job. On the other hand, I could b) opt for surgery, screw the scaphoid back together with a pin, have a partial cast for two weeks, and regain use of my wrist (AKA go back to work) after two months. My dad didn’t hesitate—he said it was a no-brainer, go for the surgery. I asked if he was sure, because (I explained this, too) it was a lot more expensive. He said absolutely, it would be ridiculous for me to spend a year in a cast if I didn’t have to. So I thanked him, called the surgeon and scheduled the surgery.

Flash forward: I’ve had the surgery, I’m out of the partial cast but still on the mends, my wife throws me a graduation party (our dime) at my parents’ (massive) property. At the end of the night, after everyone has gone home, we’re sitting with my parents and the medical bill comes up (it’s due within a month). The very first words out of my dad’s mouth are: “Sooooo, are you guys going to pay for ANY of this??”My wife and I were caught off guard so much that we didn’t know how to respond. This whole entire thing started with them offering us to pay for the medical bill because we couldn’t afford it. My wife and I both hate the idea of handouts, so we had already reworked our budget to try and pitch in for the medical bills, but neither of us thought based off of the way my parents communicated with us that that was in any way expected. Regardless, we figured we could pay for a third of the portion that our insurance wouldn’t cover. When my dad said that, we were taken aback, but we explained that we had set some money aside to pay for some of the medical bills. My parents didn’t seem relieved in any way that we were going to pay for a third and continued on as if we had asked a huge favor of them that they didn’t want to grant. My wife and I were so distraught and confused by the encounter that we decided after we left that we would rather be financially strapped than deal with the emotional manipulation that was seemingly blooming from my parents. Since then, we set up a payment plan with the surgeon (already behind on payments and have a lot more to go). But what’s really fascinating is that my parents haven’t brought it up or mentioned it in anyway since. They don’t seem to notice or care that a $10,000 medical bill that they agreed to pay for was never collected from them. Furthermore, they have continued to communicate with us about normal things, but even when my wrist gets mentioned, they don’t seem to have a thought in the world about how it’s getting paid for, despite knowing fully that we don’t have the money.The part of me that spends all of its time on r/legaladvice is screaming “PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL!” But the part of me that kinda wishes he had parents that cared or followed through is screaming “COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH PARENTS!” At this point, the former is winning (although, I won’t make this a legal matter. Period). In reality, that just means accepting that my parents aren’t worth the strain. But it doesn’t solve the monetary issue. They’ve left us on the hook for my own medical bills, but honestly, I would have gone with the year-long cast if I’d known I would be paying for the whole thing. We absolutely don’t have the money for the surgery and we’ll end up in collections if it doesn’t get figured out. I’m going to confront my parents on the issue, but I’d love some advice on how to handle this. I’m more than okay with rocking the boat at this point, but only if it’s constructive to our situation. However, I’m at a loss as to how to make that happen or if it’s even possible. 

So, Reddit… what should I do? Should I try to hold my parents accountable for their offer or should I distance myself and wife from them until (if ever) they have a change of heart and at least offer an apology? Honestly, my inclination at this point is to cut them out of our lives entirely, make it clear we will never be seeking any type of assistance from them in the future, and that they can basically go fuck themselves with the million (not a wild guess) or so dollars in their savings that they seemingly hold just to lord over their children.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I broke my wrist, the ortho gave an option between an affordable treatment with a 6-12mo healing time and an unaffordable surgery with a &lt;2mo healing time. My parents offered to pay for the surgery, but after the surgery have conveniently forgotten their offer"
"I'm [F22] so ashamed of being ugly that I sometimes can't leave my apartment and I've turned down hanging out with my friends because of it. How do I explain to my friend [F25] that I want to hang out with her her but don't want to go to public places at all?


I've always felt ugly but in the last 2-3 years it's gotten much worse. I feel actual shame over my looks. I feel ashamed to be in public.

I look like a drug addict. I'm not joking. I'm 23 but look 10 years older. I look runned down. My face is extremely unattractive. My face is full of hormonal acne that can't be anything done about according to my doc. I have deep dark circles and bags under my eyes that can't be covered with make up. I look like a tired drug addict even when I've slept at least 8 hours.

I could go on and on and on. I'm just not attractive. And I feel so much shame over it, like it's the worst thing you can be. An unattractive female in her ""prime years"".

I avoid public places, especially night clubs and similar events where focus is good looking people. Recently my good friend H [F25] has invited me to hang out with her and her friends at a bar and I've declined every time. I want to hang out with her but I don't want to go to a public place like a bar, because I would feel too much shame.

Some days are worse than others, sometimes I don't leave my apartment because I look so rough/bad I don't want to expose myself to the public.

I'm looking into surgery but don't have the money for it.

How do I tell my friend I want to hang out with her but just not in public places? I'm so ashamed.

Tldr: I'm ashamed over being so ugly, dont want to go to public places at all."
"Husband spent over 10k on cam girls over the past two years


I am heartbroken and don’t know what to do. I found out the full truth of my (32f) husband (34m) using cam girl sites while I worked the weekends when he was suppose to be taking Care of our son (22 months old). I had my suspicions that he was up to no good but never in this way. I begged him to communicate with me, open up to me, I’ve offered myself physically and emotionally to him and he was not interested and often turned me down to turn his attention, apparently to cam girls. 

I found out about it on accident, he left a screen open, didn’t seem sorry, laughed and told me to think about our son if I was leave. He NEVER thinks about me or our son unless he feels insecure in the marriage. If it were porn here and there, it wouldn’t be a big deal. However, he initially told me it happened once, the following day, I told him to go talk to a counselor and he the. Said, he was a couple of months when we were in a rough patch but come to find out, he gave me access to his bank cards and he’s been doing it since Christmas Day 2017. Our son was 2 months or so at the time! 

I can’t sleep, eat, think, I’m disgusted and so upset. I feel so heart broken. No one has ever lied and hurt me the way he has. I don’t know if I can forgive him. He has refused to be with me sexually on so many different accounts, he was even up on the site on Mother’s Day! I want to do marriage counseling but I can never look at him the same. I have forgiven him for lots, binge drinking while caring for our son in the early months was one of them and I was starting to come around but clearly that was induration with the cam girls.

He’s admitted to not helping me with home life or raising our son because he felt like a director, on top of the world, with cam girls while messaging them. I have tried to make him feel good about himself and attractive and stuff and he always shuts me down. 

He was never one to want to watch porn, get off on it or get off for me so I don’t know. He said he had no idea he spent that much. 

Any advice would be appreciated, I will answer any comments. 

TL DR: husband of 6 yrs spent over 10k on cam girls over 2 years. I’m hurt and I consider it cheating"
"After an impromptu separation with minimal contact, I (29F) realized I am happier alone than with my husband (34M).


We've been married for 3 years, with half of that time being tumultuous and filled with arguments that we haven't been able to see eye to eye on. He was deployed for 3 months (with minimal ability to communicate besides text), but he returned a week ago. Since he's returned I've realized that:

1. I've been happy and thriving emotionally and mentally when he wasn't around and we had minimal contact.
2. This past week since he's been back has been unbearably emotionally exhausting with the arguing.

For instance. The day he returned I waited at the airport with a welcome banner (who wouldn't for a troop). I stood for 30 minutes with that banner waiting for him to walk out.

He saw it and instantly said ""this is ridiculous"". He also refused to take a picture with it and was visibly annoyed. It was publicly embarrassing to say the least.

Since then all we've done is fight. I hadn't realized that over the three months I'd gotten so used to peace that I'd become my vibrant old self again. My skin even started clearing up. Now in the week since he's been back, everyone from family to coworkers has noticed a change in me and my skin erupted.

I love him but that time away makes me think about marriage taking a toll on me and if it's worth it. It's worthwhile to say we did marriage counseling for about 3 months earlier this year and he hated it/wasn't so cooperative. He still complains about it and when I've brought up seeing another counsellor (since he's been back) he's made it clear he doesn't really believe in it.

What do I do?

Tldr; I realized that I was happier, healthier and more vibrant after a 3 month separation and minimal contact with my husband. What do I do?"
"My (32F) boss (30sM) and coworkers (30s and 40s) want my handmade birthday gifts to be ""from everyone.""


The office I (32F) work in doesn't have a culture where birthdays are celebrated.  A happy birthday email goes out every month with a list of people's birthdays.

So, I'm known as both an artist and a plant lover around our office.  About 6 months ago, I started gifting hand drawn pictures to people at work for their birthdays.  I have been doing this for everyone whether they are on my team or not.  I basically make a very cute and flattering ""portrait"" of them with their head on the ""body"" of a plant and wearing a pointed party hat.  Then I also give them a little potted plant of whichever type I used in the picture.  My coworkers seem to really love them and keep them at their desks.  

The issue...after a casual lunch meeting with my team recently (7 of us), my boss asked me if from now on, whenever I make a gift for someone not on our team, if the gift can be ""from all of us,"" and they will contribute money toward the materials.  I probably didn't react well because I was confused.  How is my hand made gift going to be ""from"" my whole team?  I said as much and also mentioned I don't actually pay much, if anything, for the materials because I already have a ton of art supplies, gardening supplies and a house full of plants.  I suggested that we do some other kind of group gift for people from our team and they all just said no and that would be boring. 

We kind of left it at that but things have been a bit awkward and people on my team have made ""jokes"" about me being selfish or something about the gifts I'm giving.  A coworker's birthday is next week and one of my teammates sent me an email with everyone on our team and our boss included asking if ""we"" are doing a party plant portrait and potted plant for them.  I haven't responded.  I am getting kind of upset because I feel like they are all just wanting me to put in the effort for a thoughtful gift and slapping their names on it for credit.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Part of me wants to stop making the party plant people drawings but several people around the office have admired them and told others that they really hope I make one from them on their birthdays too and word has gotten back around to me.

Should I just ignore them?  Should I address this with my boss (who brought it up in the first place)?  Should I stop doing the party plant portraits and potted plants?  Any advice or insight is welcome.

Tl;dr I (32F) have been making handmade portraits as birthday gifts for people around the office.  My boss (30sM) and coworkers are pressuring me to say they gifts are from all of us and I don't want to.  What do I do?"
"My [44F] husband [46M] is obsessed with our daughter’s [13F] hair


Throwaway. I am nota native English speaker and on mobile. So sorry for any mistakes.


Husband and I have been together for 20 years, married 18 years. He has a son (22M) from a previous relationship. Together we adopted our daughter.


We are a very stereotypical Dutch family. Blond hair,tall. Our daughter has an Italian mother and an Argentinian father. As a child she was very tanned and she has always had very pretty curly hair.


My husband (who is bald btw) hates our daughters hair. It has come to the point that I have filed for divorce.

When she was a child he would randomly take her to his sister, a hairdresser, to cut her hair short. Without my (or her) permission. He has done this more than ones. The most recent time was 3 years ago. When he decided to cut our daughters long hair to a 3mm buzzcut. 


Curly hair can’t be combed yet he did it all the time when she was a kid. Even now he yells that she Should comb it.

She has a bit of dandruff (scalp problems) and husband yells at her. The first thing he does when he sees her is going through her hair to see the dandruff. He doesn’t say ‘hi’. Immediately he does this. Then yells if it is not well done according to him.

Daughter got bullied at school for looking like a boy (buzzcut). Husband told her it’s cause she has dandruff.

Honestly just writing this makes me realize how mad i am. Our daughter has curly hair like Raffaela Fico. It’s gorgeous.

I need help to understand how I can support my daughter and why my (ex-husband) is doing this?


Tl;dr: husband hates curly hair, why?"
"Boyfriend (m29) doesn't seem engaged when I (f26) talk


I'm (f26) struggling a lot with a really intangible issue with my partner (m29). We've been together for almost half a year.

I'm  a trained counsellor, so I really value the quality of connections -  I'm a pretty gooey, deep-thinking, emotional person and feel like my  best self when I'm engaged in conversations on those levels. I  understand that not everyone has undergone the training I did, and  probably doesn't have those skills and things, but I still expect  curiosity in a conversation.

The  trouble is that the dynamic we are in is that he talks - a lot - about  the things he is passionate about and projects he is working on and I  tend to feel a bit trapped in listener. I do my best to ask questions  and understand what he's talking about and take an interest. I can't  help but feel that I have this arresting feeling where I can't really do  the same back with my interests because when I have done that, almost  always, he doesn't ask questions and the conversation falls flat with a  bit of a conversation-ending answer or with silence (he then says that  he felt like the conversation came to a natural end). The trouble is, he  doesn't seem to understand the components of what makes a conversation  dynamic and what makes someone feel heard. He thinks I should just  volunteer up information and that that's all it comes down to. I  understand what he's saying... he says that he feels like he doesn't  know what questions to ask a lot of the time but that he loves to hear  about me and wishes I would just volunteer up information. It's not like  that... I want him to ask questions, but more than that, I want him to  engage when I volunteer information. I want him to be curious, ask  follow-up questions, or at least comment on what I've shared, even if  it's a reflection of his own thoughts on the matter. I just feel trapped  in this state of not feeling like he knows the real me, because I feel a  bit guarded now, because I'm tired of sharing things and feeling his  response isn't genuinely curious or is a non-starter.

Yesterday,  I tried the volunteering thing and spoke openly about things, and he  gave me such dry responses... so I confronted him and told him how it  makes me feel:

""i don't want to  come across as irrational or unfair, and i know that you said that you  felt in a quieter mood today, i just feel with the amount of effort you  put into replies just reads to me like you don't care to properly  connect with me about the things i'm saying that feel important to me.  i'm used to writing massive paragraphs to people because we're still  always getting to know each other more even years down the line, to  feeling at times like i'm kinda constipated for wanting to share with  you the things i found important or meaningful that day that i really  wanna discuss... with you personally, over anyone else, cos you're my  person and above all people, i want you to know who i am on a day to day  basis. you say you want me to share more of myself of my own accord,  but when i do do that, i get replies like the ones today. i'm not  attacking you, i want you to see, that i feel disappointed... i want you  to know me, i'm trying to show you who i am in conversations like this  and i feel like you're not engaging much... it hurts

i get it but it kind of hurts

i  don't want you to feel shit in yourself, cause i know you take  conversations like this hard... i want you to know that this hurts me,  and i am sad about it, and i don't know what we should do about that.  maybe we need a conversation about what i feel like i need more of... i  don't know. i'll talk to you when we're feeling a bit better in  ourselves""

He basically said that  he felt like he was engaging but that he felt drained, and that knowing  those were my feelings was draining him more.. I asked if he felt I was  being too demanding or unfair and he said he doesn't really know.  
We  haven't spoken since. I get that he's drained and that would be fine if  this wasn't how I feel most of the time with him. Our relationship is  mostly perfect, but this is a huge thing.

I  feel like I'm going crazy. I'm a super intuitive person - I can tell  when someone's heart isn't in it. I feel like we mostly have a great  relationship but I feel like how can he know me? I don't feel like he  really gets the essence of me, because I don't feel the permission to  even share those parts of me. I can't ignore things like this - it's  provocative on my nervous system because I feel like I'm being ignored.

Any feedback would really help me. Thanks so much.

Stuck in dynamic where boyfriend mostly talks about himself - he doesn't seem engaged and curious if I talk"
"My wife [25f] and I [28m] moved onto some property I inherited with the intent to clean it up and sell it. My wife has fallen in love with it and gets emotional whenever I talk about selling it now. Not sure what I can do.


Long story. My aunt passed away a few months ago. She had no kids of her own and she wound up leaving her property to me.

The property is pretty nice. A little bit of land with a very cool little house and a couple barns up in Kansas. 

When I found out I spoke to Harper (wife, married two years) about how we wanted to handle things. We had both been kind of interested in leaving the city we were in so I floated the idea that we head up to my aunts place and move in for six months to a year or so, so we could clean it up and get it looking good to sell it, then move on somewhere new.

Don’t get me wrong, I like the property and all, it’s just that it’s a small horse ranch in Kansas. I’ve never farmed or raised horses or lived in the country even, so I don’t know what I would do with owning a horse ranch.

Harper liked the idea and we moved up here about four months ago.

She fell in love with the place almost right away. Since day one she has gone and walked the property ever day and she goes and does yoga in the front yard and she’s always hanging out in the barn. She really likes it here.

Anyway, the more we clean the place up the more she is talking about what she “would” do with different rooms if we were keeping it. Like we’re cleaning up the barn and she was telling me how cool it would be if “someone” turned it into an auto garage. Or the attic upstairs, and how she would totally make it into an office/yoga studio. You know, if we *were* to keep it. Or how she wants to get some workout machines to put on the side patio. She always says it like she’s just daydreaming but I feel like she is trying to subtly ask me if we can keep the place. She’s also begun referring to it as “our” ranch.

I do get it. She grew up poor and never had much for herself, and now all of a sudden she has 10 acres and a nice house that is all hers, and maybe she’s going a little hard.

Anyway, we are getting close to a point where we can start putting it on the market. I said something to her this morning that I was going to make an appointment with a real estate company next week to start the ball rolling and.......she started crying on me.

I asked her if it was about the property and she confirmed.

I pointed out to her that we only moved here to fix up the house and the plan was never to stay. She agreed and said she knew, she just didn’t think she would like being here so much.

And now I feel like the bad guy in a lifetime movie. I can admit, the place is cool. But again, I’m a city slicker, I don’t know what I’m doing with a ranch. And I have never been very interested in home ownership anyway.

Harper has been mostly hanging out in the barn and has been in an on/off crying mood all day that makes me feel terrible, but....what am I going to do?

What to do now? Harper obviously loves this place and I’m happy to see her happy so I don’t want to snatch it back away but......I feel like owning this place is more trouble than it would be worth for us.

What can I do? I want Harper to be happy. I want to sell the property. I’m going to have a real hard time selling the property if Harper cries every time I move forward.

What is the right thing to do? Make the wife happy and see if there is a reasonable way to keep the place? Sell the property and hope she gets over it quick? Any advice helpful, please.

**TL;DR**: I inherited some property that is cool but not something I want. My wife fell in love with it and wants to keep it. I don’t think that is a good idea. Help?"
"Update: My parents [60F/58M] admitted to not loving me [24F] as much as my siblings.


Original post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cm3g7t/my_parents_60f58m_admitted_to_not_loving_me_24f/

I want to say thank you to all of you for all of your kind words and many perspectives on this situation. 

I have communicated with my parents and have yet to speak to my sibling, but her telling me this has allowed me to enter a period of growing pains I needed to have. 

My mom told me she can't fully accept me due to feeling that some of my lifestyle choices (having tattoos, being open to all kinds of people from all sexualties/ethnicities/backgrounds/etc, more on the 'alternative' side of normal). They are things she doesn't believe in, which makes me the child that deviated from the life she wanted for me. While she didn't give a direct answer to my question, it's easy to grasp meaning from her response. She ended the call quickly and said she would speak to me when I wasn't being 'defensive'. 

My father was more sympathetic, and told me he would love me even though I have my 'own life and have made my own choices'. He also didn't answer the question. He doesn't believe in therapy, psychiatric medication, or any of the methods I've used to get better, so that's always been something we’ve disagreed on. He told me that ‘family is the only thing I have other than God’ and that I should remember where I came from. 

I had a really rough night. I unfortunately relapsed from months of abstaining self-harm. Being hard on myself is an old habit that I’ve tried to get away from. Yet, bad days still happen. I felt so incredibly alone when I accepted that my family will never be the support I need. The idea of my parents embracing me in any way died in my head last night. After wallowing for a few hours, I realized how much they don’t care to know more about the person I’ve become. I was feeling sorry for myself, mainly because I have no deep relationships outside of that support system right now.

 I’m a loner by nature and I feel like it’s me against the world at the moment. 

However, I realized how I can lift myself up and strive to make new relationships in the future.

I saw my therapist this morning and that helped me to get a grip on how to move on. 

I’m my own support system right now. 

It’s as scary as it is exciting to leave much a big source of pain and anxiety behind. 

I assume I’ll have little to no contact with my family moving forward. 

My philosophy on this situation is to be kind to myself and be patient to build my version of a loving family when I get the opportunity. 

I have a hell of a long way to go. 

But I know how to move forward now. 

TLDR: I have accepted the fact that my parents and I have fundamental differences that will never be compromised on. I’ve decided to move on with low contact and choose close relationships carefully. 

Thank you to all of you that helped me get here. 

I appreciate you more than you will ever know."
"Is it ok if I [F22] break up with my boyfriend [M35] through messages?


I’ve been wanting to break up with my boyfriend. Through text messages. The reason is that I had traumatic experiences with breaking up with someone, I was in a mentally abusive in previous relationship that makes me scared to do it in person. Also the fact that my boyfriend has a pretty similar trait to my abusive ex. 

When I first was getting to know him, I told him that I didn’t want to rush into a relationship so quick. I just got out of a relationship from before and I want to take my time. He said he understood but now I feel like he’s rushing and he’s everywhere. He said the L word a week after we started to date. He kept on saying he misses me, we’re not even a month into the relationship. I’m feeling overwhelmed. Is it fair if I break up with him through text messages? I don’t plan on telling him about the similar trait to my ex, I’m just going to use the “rushing into the relationship” for the reason to break up? Also the fact that he’s in another country right now is one of the reason I want to do it by text as soon as possible, so that he can’t come to my house or something like that (he joked about it). 

TL;DR - Bad experience from previous relationship (mentally abusive) makes me scared to break up with my boyfriend in person, +his personality is similar to my abusive ex. Is it ok to do it through messages?"
"I (F28)found my boyfriends (M30) reddit account year ago and haven't told him. He posts and comments private things he doesn't tell me about. I sometimes even given him awards because it makes him happy.


There's a subredd he likes a lot and so do I. He sent me a post a year ago or so and told me what he thought about it. I love reading comments and found one that were his exact words, it was him. 

We've been together for 3 years, we also live together and have a very nice relationship. We talk about a lot of things but he shares some very private and vulnerable things on reddit. I want to help him and be there for him, support him. But I can't force him to open up completely. Maybe one day he will. I love this man more than anything in this world, I do feel like I'm ""spying"" on him but I can't stop. I KNOW it's an invasion of his privacy, and not meaning any harm doesn't justify it. When he posts something about feeling upset I make sure to cook him a nice dinner and be extra sweet to him that day.

We both had difficult childhoods and there's nothing in there that's a complete surprise to me, just a lot more detail and more about his feelings and teens. 

Sometimes I even give him awards and a few times he has even mentioned it to me ""baby I got an award on Reddit!"" he says with joy. He doesn't show me the post and I don't make him either. I just love the look on his face when he feels like someone can relate to him.

I don't know if I should tell him or what to do with this info. 

Tl;dr: I found my bfs Reddit account and have been reading his posts/comments about personal stuff/issues for a year. I don't know if I should tell him."
"My Mom (59F) wants me (24F) to financially support her


And I don't want to. She's lazy. She's been supported her entire life. But her inheritance from my grandpa just ran out. My uncle said her options were for me to support her or for her to sell her paid off house and live in an apartment. The latter option is stupid because the house is paid off, $230k will not last her the rest of her life. My uncle is an idiot who doesn't care about her (obviously) and let her blow through her inheritance (he controlled the money). 


Now, he's saying this train wreck is my problem because I have my life together. I've worked my ass off since I was 16. Now that I'm 24 I have a pretty awesome career lined up and a potentially huge salary increase within the next two years if I work harder. But that's the thing. IIIIIIII have been working hard for my money. Why should I have to give MY money to someone who works the bare minimum to keep her state assistance? Do I want to wake up at 5 every morning and drive 2 hours on the worst interstate in the state every day for a job that stresses me out to the point of being on meds? No. But I have to because that's called being an adult and being responsible. My mom never got that lesson. She disgusts me honestly. She's useless in my opinion. I have tried looking for part time jobs for her at CVS or Walmart, but I honestly don't even think she'd be capable of doing them. She's not disabled or mentally disabled, but she doesn't want to think (even a little bit). So she probably wouldn't be able to handle being a cashier because she sucks with computers. Maybe she could be the sticker person who greets people. 


My brother (22M) lives with her, but he's just as entitled and useless as she is. He works very part time and goes to community college I think, but doesn't pay rent or anything else and I believe she still buys him food and clothes and stuff. 


I don't even know where to begin with giving her money if I should. I don't know how much longer she will be living. What if she lives another 10-15 years. Am I supposed to support her that long? I live in a very high cost of living area and I want to be able to reap what I have sown and eventually live in a nice area with a nice house. I can't save up for that while providing for her. I also do not want to live with her because we had a terribly verbally and emotionally (manipulative) relationship when I did live there, which is why I moved out when I was 19 in college. I guess I could help with the property taxes and such, but I don't want to provide the bulk of her expenses. She can't work (substitute teach) more than 8 days a month, otherwise she'll lose her benefits. She doesn't even work that much in a month anyway. When I did her expenses a few months ago, if she worked 8 days a month, she should be able to cover her expenses, so I was confused why she even need my grandpa's money in the first place. 


My family has always kept money and bills a behind doors conversation and I was never included. But now that they're a problem, they want me to fix it. I don't want my mom being homeless, but she never really helped me either. I figured out my college tuition, my first car, my housing. She has not provided a dime for any of that. My grandpa provided for my clothing, braces, extra expenses as I was growing up. I don't feel like I owe her anything. I don't know how to tell her this or what resources to provide her.

tldr: My mom wants me to financially support her because she doesn't want to get a job and lose her state benefits."
"My husband (31 M) and I (29 F) are having some strange issues


 

My husband and I have been married two years, and dated two years before that. He's the sweetest guy, and he works as a teacher's aide. Problem is that he's been having some...issues, recently. I wanted to use a throwaway for obvious reasons.

About a year ago, my husband became very involved in meditation (which is something he and I still do together). We found all these Tibetan mantras that ended up really helping with both our stress levels. I really do think it was a big help. but evidently my husband thought there was more he could do to really broaden his horizons while meditating. He eventually came across the idea of creating and developing a tulpa, some sort of a Tibetan manifestation of mental energy, which I fully supported (after all, it's in our own home behind closed doors, and something he believed would help as he interacted with it during meditation). But now I'm beginning to regret my decision supporting this tulpa thing, because at home he has essentially started interacting with it on a daily basis. Every now and then he'll hole himself up in my workroom (I'm a lawyer's aide), telling me he's working, and have these long and drawn out conversations with his tulpa, Adam. He grows very defensive of his tulpa when I try to question it, or call it anything but a living, breathing entity. He told me he's having second thoughts on having children, because his tulpa warned him against it, and every Friday he sets out an extra plate for ""Adam"" (but doesn't put any food on it). I can live with these things to an extent (maybe not the children thing, I want em and so did he until three weeks ago). But when it crosses over to our sex life, it really disturbs and alienates me. ""Adam"" participates in whatever we do in bed, and it weirds me out quite a bit. I tell him that it isn't alright with me, and he obliges, but he does the same thing a couple days later.

Small things with his tulpa have been going on for about 10 months, but these weird and alienating things started a month ago. He isn't mentally unstable, does fine in public, and can hold up a conversation perfectly. It's just that it's almost like there's another person, constantly watching us at all times.

What the fuck do I do? Say enough is enough and try to end this madness? Create my own tulpa and go from there? Take him to a shrink ASAP? I'm really balking here guys!

TLDR: My husband, who's normally a rational and lovely person, has lately injected an imaginary friend of sorts into our life and it bugs me just a little bit. Yet he's completely normal in every other activity."
"I (31/f) am visiting my boyfriend (33/m) and his family does nothing but sit and talk. I am going CRAZY.


I agreed to go across the country to visit my boyfriend's family, expecting a visit like I have had with other boyfriends, or like someone would experience visiting my family.  Instead, I am encountering a situation where the family spends every waking second together, talking.  

As soon as I wake up, ""GOOD MORNING,"" and then we make breakfast, then eat breakfast, then sit at the table and talk for an hour more, then clean up, then move to another room, then sit and talk.  Then a walk, then make lunch, talking, of course, then eat lunch, then sit at the table and talk, then clean up, and move to another room to talk.  I can't explain it; like I cannot get up to go to the bathroom because there is no break in the talking.  

The talking is so boring.  Most of it is talking about things like ""I think the neighbor down the street, yeah, she renovated her pantry, was it 2000?"" ""No, no, that was 2001.""  ""No, I am pretty sure it was 2000.""  

And I am just sitting here and I think I am actually going crazy.  I am here for TEN DAYS.  

This is nothing like anything I have ever seen before.  I thought we would go off on our own, go explore the town, go to the beach...  Apparently we are going with his parents at some point, but I don't even want to.  We woke up at 9AM, and it is now 930PM, and I have not left his family's presence, doing NOTHING BUT TALKING ABOUT THE MOST BORING STUFF EVER, except to go to the bathroom.  This is now the third day in a row of the exact same thing.  I understand family time, but he sees them quite regularly.  I guess the multiple hour phone conversations every day should have tipped me off.  

Like, my family goes out to eat, plays games, goofs around, watches movies... I mean, all we have done is sit in a circle while everyone talks.  A topic like pizza will come up, and everyone will just share everything they can think of about pizza. 

His mom seems to fucking hate me.  I am quitting smoking, but damned as hell, I went out for one in the middle of the night.  The next day, his mom was like, ""I thought BF said you didn't smoke?""  She is currently cutting his hair, while staring daggers at me.  His dad said, ""Energy level seems low today,"" as I was silently contemplating suicide.

Reddit, what the fuck do I do?  I don't wanna get between this obviously very tight-knit family that likes to talk, and I think my BF would take it the wrong way.  I NEED ALONE TIME OR BF TIME OR NOT BEING WITH HIS FAMILY FOR A SECOND TIME.  I feel trapped and miserable.

TL;DR Visiting BF for 10 days.  His family does nothing but sit around in a circle and talk about boring things for 12 hours a day and I do not feel able to sit there anymore and listen."
"My boyfriend (26) judges my drinking and refuses to drink with me (26f), but will drink with friends.


I enjoy drinking with friends on the weekends and have always wanted to with my partner. He always said he didn’t care for it but will drink with some friends (rarely) when I’m not around. He will even get drunk on these occasions. He has mentioned once that he worries too much about my safety so wants to be the sober one to watch out for me when we’re out with friends. He judged that I get too drunk so I put myself in danger. I’ve told him many times not to worry and that I want to let loose and share a bottle of wine with him or hangout with friends on vacation at the bar. He will refuse and go to bed early on vacation, but the second I leave to work he will get drunk until 4am.

Am I overthinking the fact that his friends are girls that he was previously rejected by and guys who sleep around? Maybe he enjoys their time more so he doesn’t want to go to bed and is comfortable enough to let loose?

TLDR; Boyfriend judges me drinking and refuses to drink with me because he worries about my safety, but will get drunk with coed friends all night (who he has history with) when I’m not around."
"Brothers (28m) Wife (22fm) is turning family relations into a nightmare


OK, i'm going to try and likely fail to keep this short. My brother (lets call him John) and I are the same age (yea were twins lol). We have had a very close relationship our entire lives. SWe are both in our late twenties, and had been playing soccer together every weekend, would se each other at parties and get togethers multiple times a month etc.

I am married- going on 4 years now. My brother has always been something of a serial monogamist, going from one girlfriend to the next, and this time is no different. He started dating a girl, lets call her Katie. Katie seemed nice at first- outgoing and easy to talk to. She came over to some family events, and everything seemed to be going fine. BUt little by little, that facade has been falling apart.

Katie comes from a bad family. Single mom who was very controlling, to the point that she literally had her fingers in every aspect of Katie's life. The rest of her family was addicted to drugs, alcohol, etc you get the point. This has made Katie very jaded, and she has an intense focus on respect and gets offended very easily. Her mom came from a poor background, and to compensate for that stressed hwo important being classy and showing that you had money was to Katie.

My wife and I aren't like that. We are very successful for our age- our household income is about 250k per year, we have 4 houses (3 thaty we rent out). Essentially we are where Katie wants to be, and it causes animosity, because quite admittedly, I dress like a slob, have a lot of friends who aren't ""classy"" or up to her standards. I live life on my own terms.

She has made a couple of rude comments to me over the last couple of months. At a dinner with me and my wife, she made a comment about how she would ""never let her husband wear such a cheap wedding ring"" referring to my ring (which I regularly use as a bottle opener lol). She also made a comment once at a bbq at my house that my pants looked ""shaggy"" and it looked like I couldn't afford better clothing. I confronted her and my brother about these comments as nicely as possible, and they took very much offense to it.

Next- they had been talking about getting engaged for a while. Katies family was very mich against the idea, and my family was tentative about it at best, as they had been dating for well less than a year. They said they understood, got engaged anyway, and then started planning an elaborate wedding. I was going to be the best man, until about a week later, they announced to everyone that they had gone to our local courthouse and gotten married. Literally by themselves, didn't tell anyone. Well, since then (about 2 months ago) Katie's family has literally disowned her, and my family has been trying to be supportive because of how much we love John.

This has led to us going to dinners at their house that we didn't want to, and going out drinking occasionally.

The last time we went out, we ended up going to a night club with Katie, John, and two of Katie's cousins. The whole night, Katie was making my brother hold her drinks, buy her more drinks or give his credit card to her (""John! Card! Now!) and just generally treating him like a friggin doormat. In general he also pays for everything , their apartment, vacations, whatever. She also ended up getting in a loud verbal altercation with her cousin at the nightclub, that ended with her trying to fight him. Shit like this happens every time we go out with them, and we have no interest in doing it again after that experience.

It has been a huge hassle trying to get them out to do anything - they always have an excuse, whether its Katie's anxiety, their lack of money, but if they invite us to soemthing and we decline Katie gets super offended and blows up at us. I haven't seen my brother without her in months, he never goe to events with out friends anymore, and we don't play soccer at all. I asked him if he wanyes to play yesterday and he informed me that ""weekdays were for the wife"". Well, so apparently are weekends, and every day of his life now. It is also painfully obvious that whenever he is talking with me over text that she is coaching him on what to say.

My brother also asked me a couple days ago if Katie could  stay at our place for a week while he was in New Orleans doe work, as she did not like being alone.  This, to me anyway, is a huge ask. We both have very demanding jobs and responsibilities, and just don't want someone living with use for a week.  I was honestly a little floored that John couldn't find an hour to spend with me during the week, but felt it was ok to ask if his wife could live with us for a week.  

At the end of the day, I just don't kjnow what to do., I want to keep a relationship with my brother, but shes beginning to make that impossible, and too difficult. I have a demanding job and manage my own household, the three rentals, a dog etc and don';t have the time or energy for this shit that Katie is pulling. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR  Brothers new wife is making it really difficult for me to want to have a relationship with him,  don't know what to do"
"I(24F) told my best friend(27F) that I didn't feel comfortable being apart of her wedding due to the toxicity of her relationship. Was I wrong to do that?


This is honestly the only place I(24F) can go to for an outsiders perspective without risking the chance of someone I know seeing it. Please be honest with me. 

So one of my best friends (27F) of about 2 years asked me to be in her wedding about a year ago. I of course said yes and was super on board. The wedding is Oct. 12 2019. Coincidentally, she is marrying my boyfriend (26M) of 5 years best friend which made it all even cooler. We've literally talked about the wedding in some form almost every single day since then. 

Now I'm going to admit that my friend and her fiance's(26M) relationship was never a strong one to begin with. They've only been together about 2ish years and there was/has been lots of cheating and dishonesty but they worked through it and to each their own, ya know? I personally couldn't marry someone that cheated on me and that I had trouble trusting but this isn't about me so I kept that to myself. 

Flash forward to the last three months and a lot of stuff has gone down. To keep things short and sweet, my friend has confided in me about some really concerning shit that her fiance has been saying to her and they have almost called the wedding off twice. I'm beginnning to believe that her fiance has sociopathic tendencies. 7 days ago she attempted to break up with him because of his super controlling and narcissistic behavior.... But he sent her flowers at work and that made it all better for her. They agreed to work things out. Keep in mind, my friend has already admitted multiple times to me that she doesn't want to marry him and that the only reason she is going to go through with it is because she (not he, not even once cent) has paid over $14000 so far for the wedding. He's super mean and mentally abusive/controlling and she literally cries almost every single day because of it. He is using her for her money and stability and he has basically admitted that to one of the other bridal party members. (There's so much more but you'd be reading for days). 

So last night (I had been drinking for the first time in like months lol) my friend calls me again and tells me that she gave the engagement ring back to her fiance and said that she told him she didn't want to go through with the wedding. Coincidentally me and a couple of the other people who are apart of the bridal party agreed last night that we didn't feel comfortable being in the wedding because of everything that was going on. I knew that even though she gave him the ring back, that they were going to make up at some point that night or the next day. So... The liquid courage convinced me to tell her that if she worked it out with him and they decided to go through with the wedding again after all this that I wouldn't be comfortable being apart of it anymore. So she freaked out on me and basically said that I was a terrible person and that I was not supportive and that it shouldn't matter who she's marrying, I should stand by her side no matter what. She's going through with the wedding and I'm no longer a part of it.  

So yeah, I'm sorry for the long novel. I feel like shit but I also feel like I did the right thing. Please tell me what you guys think 😭

TL;DR I told my best friend I didn't want to be in her wedding anymore because her relationship is toxic and unhealthy! Was I wrong?? Should I have not said what I said and went through with being in the wedding regardless of everything?"
"My boyfriend [24m] lost weight and turned into a completely different person


I'm 22f. He's always been attractive to me but I began dating him a year and a half ago and he was overweight. Not massively (he actually lost weight before we got together) but enough where it totally crippled his confidence. A couple years prior, he had been fit and because of his weight gain he hated even going out in public in our city because people he used to know would comment on his weight gain and joke about it. He also had on and off problems with drugs that made it difficult for him to find the motivation to change his life. I have always tried my best to support him through this but his self esteem was terrible. 

He stayed at home a lot, he would always say he was going to lose weight but never got around to seriously trying until 5 months ago. He just suddenly snapped. He stopped taking the drugs (he quit so quickly it actually caused him to suffer dangerous withdrawal symptoms) and went on a crash diet and lost all the weight plus some in just 3 months. 

He's now skinny and fit like he was in his late teens and way more confident, in an almost manic way? He is happy to go out now and loves attention. I have to admit, he is very good looking and has somehow become smooth and flirty. He will happily flirt with other girls while I am literally right there. He is so desperate for other people's attention and approval, everyone except mine. 

All his friends are happy because ""the old him is back"" and want him to come out a lot. Like all this has been going on for two months and I just feel totally swept to the side. I was trying to gently encourage him to lose weight for the entire relationship (I knew how unhappy he was with his weight) and I supported him through his drug addiction and tried to get him to the doctors so many times. Instead he just starves himself for 3 months and nearly dies quitting the drugs. I feel like this level of change is unsustainable and he's going to burn out soon. He seems to live on like a bowl of vegetables a day I have no idea where he even gets all this energy from.

He just completely ignores me though, it's like I don't even exist to him anymore. He wants sex from me but that's it, and he is so much less generous in bed now. We literally never argued before because he is the least argumentative person ever, so I find myself pretending to be mad at him because it's literally the only way I can get attention from him. I hate that I'm acting like this but I'm sad and I want to have a boyfriend again. 

I've noticed he's messaging several different girls on his phone, he says they're just old friends that he wanted to catch up with. I've noticed he's always messaging people whereas before he had like 3 friends he would talk to. I don't think he's cheated but he could easily be planning on it. When he's not going out with people he's spending every second in the gym and comes home completely drained and has no time for me. 

Don't get me wrong I'm so happy he's turned his life around but he seems to have left our relationship behind and it hurts so bad because I care about him so much. I've asked if he even likes me anymore and he just says of course he does, that's as far as I can get him to go with the conversation.  It's like he's a completely different person, he was so attentive before. 


tldr; boyfriend lost weight very quickly, quit drugs and became so much more confident and goes out all the time. He basically just ignores me now and spends all his time trying to get attention from other people and is messaging random girls"
"My (35F) husband (36M) took a year off to better himself and change careers. The year is almost up and he’s done practically nothing and became addicted to a game on his phone.


First post ever and it’s from my phone so apologies for any grammar/spelling errors and what is probably the over use of commas. 
Note: Holy moly this turned out to be a long post. Thank you in advance to those who read it all the way to the end. 

TL;DR at the bottom.

My husband (37M) hasn’t worked in almost a year. His track record for holding a job isn’t the best. Every six months he either got fired or quit. Over the last three years he’s gone through about 10+ jobs.
I (36F) have had three jobs in the last 15 years. I’ve been at my current job for six years and will most likely spend the rest of my career here. 

My husband took stress leave and then went on E.I last October. He was supposed to spend his time planning/switching to a new career and getting himself healthy. Instead, he spent most of the year doing things with/for his mom, my mom and his friends. He went fishing almost every weekend in the winter and goes every-other weekend in the summer. He also goes every other Friday to his buddy’s house to play hockey. In the beginning I knew he was really struggling so I never stopped him from doing the things that made him happy. But, during this time he was also supposed to get help for his mental health. He has a terrible anger problem/temper which is part of the reason he can’t keep a job (he has never been violent towards me). He went to the doctor and got medication. It helped. It really, really helped. Then he stopped taking it everyday; he said he kept “forgetting”. In the beginning, I reminded him but then it felt like nagging so I stopped. He was supposed to get counselling because he had all the free time to go to the appointments. But he didn’t set it up until about a month ago and that was only after I did all the research and found a place. 
When he first took leave, he said that he would keep the house up. Which he hasn’t done. He does the bare minimum but does cook dinner every night. I have to do the rest (dusting, bathroom, laundry, etc) myself on weekends after working all week. Which, I would have gladly done if he were busy during the week doing what he said he was going to do with this time. I have asked him to do certain things in the past but he kept “forgetting” or he gets “busy”. I got tired of asking and getting mad when it wasn’t done. I also got tired of having to ask. 
Then in April he started playing this GoT game on his phone. Every time I look over at him, he’s on his phone playing that game. The iPhone has that new “screen time” feature and during a heated discussion about said game, I asked him to bring up his screen time thing. I honestly didn’t expect to see what I did (and I don’t think he did either). His screen time averaged to EIGHT HOURS A DAY. A full work day. I told him that, that’s absolutely ridiculous and a waste of time. But the worst was yet to come. 
I caught him in a lie about a month ago. He told me he wasn’t spending money (something we don’t have much of, because he’s not working) on this game. Once in awhile my mom would give us each iTunes cards, which I knew he spent on the game, which was fine; it’s a gift that he can do whatever he wants with. 
One day he was telling me about how the game glitched, he lost a whole bunch of things and had to email the game-making people. He was so happy that he got everything back that he showed me the email he got from the game people. I read the whole thread and saw, “I’ve spent quite a lot of money on this game.” When I asked him about it he told me that, that’s what his friends on the game said to say. We went back and forth until he finally admitted that he’s spent money from the bank account for this stupid game. He apologized and said he wouldn’t spend more money. Every time I look over and I see that he’s on his phone I get raging mad (on the inside). I’ve asked him to stop playing it and he flat out told me no. When I comment on how long he’s been on his phone he gets mad and says he doesn’t know what the big deal is. Right now, if he’s not playing on his phone, he’s sleeping. After working long days, it’s hard to come home and see that basically nothing has been done with either himself or the house; which means he spent the entire day playing this game and/or sleeping. 
Because he’s been struggling with mental health issues and depression (which I know all too well) I haven’t been very vocal when I’m mad. I’ve been keeping everything in and lately I feel like I’m going to blow. 
My work is a very high stress job, my mother has a lot of mental health issues (she is a prime example for r/narcissisticparents) and I have my own issues. So I am really, really struggling to keep it all together. 
We have been together for 15 years (married for 11) and don’t have kids. I still love him but this is becoming too much. I don’t know how to bring it up without it coming across as a threat- or should be a threat? I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable about being so mad when it comes to this game and my expectations of what he was supposed to do with this year off; or if it is justified.
I’ve kept pretty quiet about all of the things that have been making be mad over the course of this year; which isn’t a good thing. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of but it’s partially my fault because I’ve kept so quiet about it all.
He’s supposed to go back to work in October and he’s completely unprepared which means we’re just going to go back to him not being able to keep a job; which is stressful in itself. 
The few times I’ve tried to start a conversation, he gets angry and extremely defensive and it turns into a fight where he tells me I haven’t been supportive. After the fight is done he apologizes for saying that, but it’s still something he says which causes me to fly off the handle. 

 I’m looking for advice on how to bring this up/start a conversation that comes from a place of love but also a place of strength and seriousness. I know that he’s struggling right now so I don’t want him to feel like I’m attacking him. But at the same time, he needs to get his shit together because he’s not doing anything to help himself and I’m tired of being supportive of someone who isn’t putting in the effort to get better. 


TL;DR: Husband took a year off to switch careers and get mental health help. Ten months in, he hasn’t done anything about anything and is addicted to a game on his phone. He is supposed to go back to work in October and he’s done virtually nothing to better himself or get help. Unfortunately, I’ve been rather quiet about my frustrations so it’s going to look like it’s out the blue. The few times I’ve tried to bring this up he gets angry and defensive so we never end up solving anything or having any kind  of  plan/solution. Need advice on how to start a conversation and what I can do to help him but at the same time.. not put up with the crap."
"My boyfriend (27) and I (26) want to move in together but I told him 6 months ago that I wouldn't until he is employed. He still is not.


My partner and I have been together for 4 years. We bounce back and forth between his place and mine, but I am the one mostly going to see him. It is a 20 minute commute so not too bad.

He has been unemployed for 3 years and pays his bills through savings and help from family.

We have been talking about moving in together for about a year, when his roommate left their 2 bedroom last summer. But 6 months ago when we were really considering it, I told him that I would not feel comfortable moving in until he had a job/income. He still hasn't found a job and he is paying for a 2 bedroom with only himself living in it.

It is now august, and we have been talking again about the transition. I have agreed to compromise to live in his place until we get settled and take some time to adjust and then work towards a better place for us both. But when I told him that I still can't break my lease because he doesn't have a job and that I want security and stability in my relationship- he freaked out and made it seem like I only cared about the money and that he ""always pays his bills on time and always pays me back and has never asked me for money"". He completely missed the point and went on the defense.

He has known about this condition for 6 months and still has not done anything about it. He told me that he ""promises to get a job by the time I move in"" (in 3 months) but I have to break/renew my lease in a month. I really don't think I can break a lease over a promise- especially when he knew 6 months ago I needed him to gain employment and he hasn't done it. So far his actions have shown me that he doesn't care about my needs and that he just is in a tough spot and needs me to bail him out. Am I wrong feeling this way? I don't know how to get through to him or where to go from here.

I care about emotional, financial stability in a relationship and I feel like as an adult, you have to be responsible for yourself to build a strong foundation together. I don't want to do something stupid just because he's dug himself in a hole. How can I make him understand this while also supporting him and encouraging him that I AM ready for this step?

TLDR; boyfriend and I want to move in together but he isn't employed and is fighting me on it."
"My (28/F) boyfriend (28/M) of a year is upset with me for allowing his younger brother (24/M) to drunkenly sleep on my couch.


As it’s only been a year, my boyfriend and I don’t live together yet. I live downtown, close to all of the night life and all of that, and also far closer to where I work than where my boyfriend lives in the next city over. 

His brother recently broke up with his girlfriend after finding out that she had cheated on him. I’m not sure about the details because he was really drunk when he was explaining everything to me over the phone. I have met my boyfriend’s entire family and I’m pretty close to them already, so that’s why his brother even has my number to begin with.

Anyway he called me at around ten o’clock last night and asked if I could get a hold of my boyfriend. I told him that my boyfriend was already fast asleep since he had to work early the following morning and that his phone was likely on silent. It sounded as though the brother was having a rough night so I offered to pick him up from wherever he had been drinking and drop him home. As it turned out he had called it off with his girlfriend (with whom he had been living) so he didn’t want to go home where she was. He said he wanted to sleep at my boyfriend’s house or maybe a friend’s house. I offered to wait with him until he could get a hold of someone. 

Given that I have a younger brother as well, I would hope that someone would look out for him that way when he’s having a rough night. You don’t just leave someone drunk and alone on some street corner like that. Anyway I convinced him to just let me pick him up and then he could either sleep on my couch or go to a friend’s apartment if he’s able to get a hold of one of them. 

The whole way over I was calling my boyfriend to let him know what was going on. I also texted him. It was late. He was asleep. He didn’t get back to me in time. His brother was a mess. I picked him up and prepared my couch for him, along with a glass of water and a paper bag in case he needed it. The following morning he woke up and apologized to me right away, thanked me, offered to buy me a drink the next time we’re all out together, etc. That was it. 

My boyfriend called me soon after his brother had left in a cab. I explained everything to my boyfriend again. Honestly I thought he was going to be relieved to find out that I hadn’t left his brother hanging like that. But he went quiet instead. When I asked if something was wrong, he said nothing was wrong, the he was simply tired. Then later he sent me a long message basically saying that it was weird of me to let his brother sleep on my couch. Especially after he’d been drinking. And he also said that I should have just dropped him off at their family’s house if I was so worried. Or even sent him home in a cab. 

But it was really late and his brother was having such a rough night. It would have been cruel to just shove him home in a cab. But maybe that’s just me. 

I don’t know. 

I think my boyfriend is being unreasonable. And when I said that, he basically told me not to contact him for the rest of the day. 

I really don’t know what to think or how to process his reaction. 

**tl;dr** His brother was having a really rough night after finding out his girlfriend had cheated. I let him sleep on my couch because I was the closest to where he was and because neither of us had been able to get a hold of my boyfriend. Now my boyfriend is upset with me even though I really don’t feel that I did even the slightest thing wrong."
"My (24F) Boyfriend (27M) refuses to speak to me over my birth control choices


Throwaway because my boyfriend reddits but we try to avoid each other’s accounts.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. Things are going well, we have our fights but nothing too terrible. I came into our relationship on the progestin only pill (I can’t take the combo pill because of a health condition). My pill has a 3 hour window to take it.

 I will already admit I’m not the best with taking pills in general. Before we got together I was single for over a year and was having sex sparingly and with condoms so I while I kept the habit of taking the pill, I wasn’t worried if I took outside the 3 hour window. Since we’ve been together there have been two times, where we’ve had sex within the past few days and then I forgot to take my pill within the 3 hour window. 

The first time, my boyfriend and I freaked out and took necessary precautions but my boyfriend got really upset with me. I already told him I’m not the best with pills (he had tried to help remind me at the beginning of our relationship but that stopped after a few days) and mentioned that I had been thinking about getting an IUD. He was completely against this because he felt it was unsafe and had heard horror stories of uterus perforation. I told him that the IUD is actually really safe and super effective and if I had any issues I could just get it removed. But he was really against it so I shelved the topic.

Well last week, we had sex and then the next night we went to dinner and a movie and didn’t get out of until the 3 hour window had passed and I had forgotten my birth control at home. I took it right when I got home, maybe an hour hour outside the window but my boyfriend was livid. He said I was careless and irresponsible, accused me of trying to trap him with a child (this isn’t true I don’t want children either and he knows that). He said he felt like he couldn’t trust me.

After his blow up, I decided to say fuck it and make an appointment for an IUD. It just works better with who I am as a person. I told him the next day that while I understand his concerns, considering how upset me forgetting my birth control makes him, the fact that I don’t want children any time soon, that I’m just not great with pills, and that the decision is ultimately up to me, I decide to get an IUD. I told him he was under no obligation to come with me or help take care of me afterwards (though if he wanted to it would be appreciated) but I hope he understood that I felt this was the best decision.

He didn’t take it well. He told me that all his concerns were for my health and if I could just disregard his concerns then he clearly didn’t mean that much to me. We had this talk on Monday, he didn’t talk to me again until Wednesday. Yesterday he asked me if I was still going through with getting the IUD (my appointment was this morning) and I said yes. He hasn’t spoken to me since. 

I don’t know what to do. I didn’t think this would be that big of a deal. And in the end it’s a choice that benefits the both of us. I just don’t know how to fix this. 

TL;DR: Against my boyfriends concerns, I decided to get an IUD. He now won’t speak to me."
"I [27F] started dating a [23M] and was recently contacted by his ex [21F] who sent me a very concerning message and I don't know what to believe


Met this guy at an improv show. He was confident, intelligent, funny, cute, all that jazz. We went for coffee a couple of times, then he came over to stay at my place for a few times and we decided to be mutually exclusive (that was 2 months ago). We only get to see each other one or two evenings on work days and every other weekend because he works a lot, on top of his 9-5 he's got a side-project. Initially I was apprehensive about dating a younger man but throughout our conversations he seemed to have his life together better than some of my peers even.

Everything was really perfect until a girl I know to be his ex-girlfriend contacted me on FB saying she felt obligated to warn me about him. She wrote out some seriously abusive behaviors that didn't sound like him at all. In fact, he told me his ex was childish, unable to communicate and hold down a *normal* job, a deadbeat guardian of her younger brother and he was overall disappointed in her as a human.

Next day I met him in a public place and asked more about his previous relationship under the guise of wanting to know more. He repeated what I said, adding a ""I always did everything as she asked and she never was happy or grateful"" at the end of every other sentence. It raised alarm bells because he spoke a lot of her faults and tried to minimize any of his own possible actions.

I wrote her back and asked for some proof and maybe elaboration or details or something. She offered a meeting or a phone call, I decided to call her. She told me facts I never even knew about: they still lived together (in separate rooms) because he won't let off the lease since he can't pay for the flat alone and she won't pay him 1/2 of the bills after moving out, they broke up because he had an affair, he's medicated for depression and anxiety and a bunch of other facts. He didn't lie about them, but he didn't come forward either and I feel like it's important to talk about serious things like that when committing to someone. I can understand the shame and stigma about mental health, I struggled and opened up to him about my struggles with feelings when I was younger and he was supportive.

I asked her if she has any proof of the abuse but she said she won't send me screenshots because he will get aggressive if he has proof of her sending that, but she again extended an invitation to meet at a public place or contact another one of his ex-girlfriends that will be able to confirm his abusive behavior.

I'm so so conflicted and confused! He seems such a great guy, not pushy in anything, polite, kind, helpful... He possesses all qualities I want my long term partner to have. On top of that his life is in order, he's financially stable, my mom likes him (my dad doesn't but he's really old-fashioned, never has liked any of my boyfriends), he loves dogs and just!!! !!! 

I'm really not digging the ""he'll get aggressive if he knows I sent you screenshots"" excuse from the exgf, and if he was abusive why didn't she just leave him once they broke up and block him everywhere so he wouldn't be able to contact her regarding the rent and everything?? I don't want to meet her either, if she's a liar about something so serious she might cause drama or a scene.

**TLDR** My new boyfriend has great LTR potential and seems like a great guy. I was contacted by his ex, who he said is a bad person, claiming he's an abuser, but she's acting shady on providing any proof and wants to meet and/or ask another one of his exes. I don't know who to believe."
"My(25f) marriage was a completely mistake. I don't know how to leave.


This is going to be a long one and a really annoying post. I've (25f) been married to him (31m) for three years. I'm totally aware that I am a cliche and probably had all of this coming to me as well. 

I worked with my husband for about a year and a half before we started dating. He wasn't a coworker I really knew well, but I worked with him a lot and we got along. The agency I worked for had pretty close knit groups because of the nature of the job. I would say we became friends less than a month and started dating the next (He was leaving for the military in 6 months. AGAIN i know I'm a cliche). The problem was I didn't really think we were in enough of a relationship to even consider it a relationship until a few months. Mainly because we were just hooking up and it was never obvious when we were around our friends. When I finally had a heart to heart with him about our relationship a few months in, he told me he loved me like minutes into that conversation. 

He went to boot camp and I accepted a new position, had a few side gigs, was volunteering for youth sports teams, and was doing very well. Of course I missed my (boyfriend at the time), but I was doing so many things and was probably the happiest I had been. I went to his graduation, was excited for him, and even thought our relationship was new I discovered that I didn't mind doing long distance as long as it worked. 

Well he went to training after graduation and found out he was going to be stationed across the states. Which was fine! I said I would visit him and such. About 8 months into our relationship, we talked about marriage and if it would be an option in the future. I told him I did not plan to quit my job and just follow him around. He agreed. Apparently his mom and my mom got into it a little because his mom was saying it would be so wonderful when I moved with him (as in right after he graduated training) and my mom was like, uhhh I think she's staying home for a while. His mom thought it was ridiculous and my mom kind of just backed away slowly. 

So as you can guess, literally weeks before he's supposed to move cross country he tells me he thinks it would be better if I would just move with him. I can take my time to find a job and everything will be great. I still don't know why I did it, but I gave in and moved and We got married days before we left. I had family members that told me I should be able to do what I wanted, my mom was frustrated when I spoke to her about leaving versus staying and she basically told me  to just leave if that's easiest. I had one good friend who sat me down and told me I was making a mistake and destroying my career for it. 

In the first four months, I was looking for jobs in the same field and learned the hard way that it wasn't possible without a  master's degree. There were jobs I applied for that had 5,000+ applicants. There were a couple 10,000'ers. I went to interviews and was turned down for basic entry level jobs for people with years of experience. I finally found a job on base but it took almost a year. During those first four months I lost maybe 35 pounds. I'm 6' and was 155 pounds when I left so I was basically bones when we visited home the first time. I remember my husband was upset that I couldn't find a job so I ate bare minimum to save money. Clothes were falling off of me, but he would get mad when I spend $20 at marshalls for jeans and would go through the trash to find tags. I think I was pretty depressed just being reject constantly so it was harder to get out of bed and put effort into myself as well. When I mentioned this later because I was upset about it, he said he didn't notice (which is bullshit, he just didn't care)

There were a lot of things that made him a shitty husband in that first years and I can't seem to get over the resent even after two years. So much so that I get angry in spurts and don't want to be around him.  I think he's sorry and he's told me that he knows he was a bad husband. But this resentment is eating me alive. There was a lot of red flags that I think it was expected that I would just forgive and forget, but it's been impossible. There are times that I brought up that I almost left when things were bad and it seemed to effect him. When I would get upset and confront him about things, he would get extremely distraught and start crying, then I would have to comfort him. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue now is that when I pull away, he seems to try and pull me back. Recently he got a job offer in a city I've been dreaming of living in(It's still military affiliated and apparently he has a say in when he could move or something?). I dropped out of school to save money so I could pick back up when we got there, started applying for jobs, putting a lot of effort into this. We both hate where we are now so this was like a godsend.  A few weeks ago he admitted he really didn't want to accept the job and wanted to move to our home state in high cost of living city. He said his plan is to extend his contract a year and then get a job. I wouldn't be able to go to school right away and finding a job would be difficult again and it basically puts my goals on hold for a year. 

I told him that I'm applying for jobs out of state and am leaving as soon as I find something and he agrees I should do that and we should start planning our future so we are living in the same city within a year. But everything in me in pulling to use that time to separate and divorce. Just as soon as my dreams for this other city were squashed, it was like the effort I wanted to put in my marriage was gone. Added with past resentment,  I can't even force myself to care. I've noticed that I will find any excuse to leave, like we have condoms missing from his drawer, but I don't think he's cheating I just kind of hope he is so I have that excuse?

How do I start this conversation with him? I know he's going to go ballistic, start making effort, just to go back to his same ways a few weeks later. And I know he's going to trying to get me to comfort him through it to try to change my mind. Am I even right in feeling this way? I am so afraid that in ten years the things I am feeling now are just going to snowball and I'm going to be wasting years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Husband was shitty to me in first year of marriage. I can't get over some of the things that happened and am afraid I never will. I'm really afraid that to tell him I want a divorce because he's going to fight it. I'm afraid he's more afraid of being alone than he wants to be a husband."
"How do I (f27) save my relationship with my boyfriend (25) after the mess I created?


Long read

My boyfriend ""A"" and I have been together for three years. Him and I were supposed to visit a few friends and family members of mine  for my birthday/vacation to California. The trip had been planned months in advanced to avoid any complications. Everything was going smoothly until my friend ""Holly"" decided she would join our vacation for a few days because she also has family in California.

My boyfriend was always skeptical of Holly because she apperantly has a drug problem that she didn't care enough to get help for. Initially, I assumed that he didn't want her there simply because he thought she would be an inconvenience. Holly seemed like a good person and had never given me a reason not to trust her. My boyfriend thought otherwise.

My boyfriend would always tell me Holly was a bad influence and that it wasn't the best idea for either of us to be around her. He claimed she was only pretending to be nice. He said that something always felt off about her. My boyfriend can be cynical at times and I simply believed he was paranoid because he hasn't really gotten to know her.

The arguments between me and my boyfriend began the last couple of weeks leading up to the trip. He kept pressing on about how Holly was a bad influence and not a nice person. I got fed up with it and accused him of being controlling and manipulative (he's not). On the final argument before the trip he gave me an ultimatum; he said if Holly went on the trip, he would stay behind.

I was so angry with him that 2 days before the trip I went and stayed with Holly and didn't answer any of his calls. During our last argument  I grabbed my stuff and stormed off. My boyfriend asked where I was going and I replied ""to find somebody better and less controlling.""  He didn't know where I was and I ultimately ended up going on the trip with Holly (HUGE mistake).

Turns out the ""family"" Holly had in California were just drug dealers. I let Holly borrow a pair of jeans from me and when she returned them...you guessed it, drugs were in the pockets. She tried to get me to do drugs with her and even sell it. 

I left home a day later and immediately tried to apologize to my boyfriend, but he didn't answer my texts or my calls. When I got home I could tell my boyfriend had been crying a lot because his eyes were so swollen. He packed a small backpack and left to stay at his brother's for a  couple days. To make matters worse, he left a box with the most beautiful bracelet I have ever seen and a letter tittled ""to the love of my life."" I immediately started bawling because I chose a dumb friend over him.

I feel like a complete idiot for not trusting my boyfriend when he was only looking out for my well being. I regret what I said and what I did. I deserve to be told every insult under the sun.

Please help me. He hasn't broken up with me, but how do I apologize and win his love back? How can I make it up to him for my fucking stupidity? I'll do anything not to loose him. 

TL;DR: chose a stupid drug addict friend over my loving boyfriend."
"Me [27 M] with my girlfriend [30 F] of one year. I have a date with another woman [28 F] and am not sure what to do.


My girlfriend is not good at controlling her emotions.  She is the type of person who, when she's upset, will lash out at people who did nothing wrong or are even trying to help.  Lately she's been the worst I've ever see her due to a number of stressors in her life, including her grandpa being terminally ill.  I've done my best to be supportive, but she's just really unstable.  Yesterday I sent her a text telling her to let me know if there's anything I could do to help, and she replied by saying, ""We're not dating anymore.""  I was stunned.  That came completely out of nowhere and was out of character for her even when she's in one of her moods.

I was so hurt that I made an account on a dating website.  I don't really know what I expected because I'm honestly not very attractive and have always struggled with women, but to my complete surprise, I started chatting with a girl who asked if I was free for a date this week.  I said yes and asked if Monday (tomorrow) would work well for her.

Before the girl from the dating website could reply, my girlfriend texted me that she was sorry for what she said and that she didn't really mean it.  This was about 12 hours after she sent the ""We're not dating anymore"" text.  I guess I should've known that in the first place, but I was just so hurt.

The problem is that the girl from the dating website replied shortly afterward and said that tomorrow does work well for her, and she seems very excited about the date.  I have no idea what to do now.  I don't feel like I did anything wrong getting myself in this situation because of what my girlfriend said.  I also don't feel like the girl from the dating site deserves to get canceled on, especially because she seems like a cool person, so I'm tempted to go on the date and just not tell my girlfriend.  But part of me feels like that's wrong and also had the potential to spiral out of control if the date goes well.

I don't know what to do.  I wish my girlfriend could control her emotions better and never would've created this situation.

tl;dr: Girlfriend said we were breaking up, I surprisingly scored a date with another woman almost immediately, and then my girlfriend took back what she said.  Not sure how to proceed."
"My (27m) girlfriend’s (31f) dad (late 50s) has invited himself on our trip of a lifetime


We’re going to Japan for 3 weeks in October, flying into Tokyo and then touring around the main island for the rest of the ~2 weeks. When we booked the flights and told him about it, he basically said that he was thinking of coming with us, I was a bit taken aback obviously about the audacity for somebody to invite themselves on such a huge trip like that but was really hoping it was just talk and wouldn’t be followed up on.

 
His wife is going back to Trinidad for 3 months over the winter and so he is touring around SE Asia for that time, planning to meet us in Tokyo when we arrive and spend the holiday with us. My girlfriend went down to see him over the weekend while I was away and said that instead of him previously saying that he would be with us for the 5 days we’re in Tokyo before moving round the country at his own pace, he wants to basically travel on the route we’re planning for the 3 weeks because he feels daunted at the idea of travelling around Japan on his own and that he’d feel a bit lonely doing so. Her Dad has travelled a fair bit over the years backpacking and so on so I was a bit confused when the impression I get from Japan is that it will be pretty easy to travel through with trains etc. He said that he wouldn’t be bothered about spending time with us during the day etc and just wants to travel with us on our route, I can’t see that being realistic in practice as it would be so difficult to just avoid him for any time other than travel surely? I feel like this would take away a fair bit for me from the tour we had planned having another person there, not to mention that person being a parent.
 

I have had no problems with her Dad and get on well with him, but he can be a bit difficult and needy when it comes to my girlfriend and makes her feel guilty when she shouldn’t for small things, he kicked up a real fuss about things like Father’s day and his birthday etc when he doesn’t reciprocate the same standards when it comes to her birthday and so on. I’m working my ass off and am completely miserable at the moment leading upto October when we will be going. It’s going to cost thousands of pounds in total and touring round Japan for 3 weeks isn’t something I can imagine I’m going to be able to ever do again. I just feel like this is a big cloud hanging over the trip that I want to spend with my girlfriend.
 

My girlfriend says she’s not fussed about if he comes or not but “in a way she’d quite enjoy him being there” but told him that she’d discuss it with me and let him know, he said he wouldn’t be bothered if we said yes or no but I really am taking that with a pinch of salt because I’m worried he would guilt trip my girlfriend into feeling bad about it if I said no. I feel like this is all now directly on me because she would be ok with him coming and I’m sure he would know that as well, I feel awful about having to say “no” because I still have to speak to him and see him and I don’t want my girlfriend to get the brunt of it or to be made to feel guilty. My girlfriend knows how I feel about this already but said she would discuss it with me. I also feel like this would be a completely different story if it was one of my parents inviting themselves along, they aren’t as well travelled and I just feel that she would not be happy about it (I wouldn’t be happy with anybody from my side inviting themselves along).
 

What is the best way to manage this? Do I just bite the bullet and have him travel with us with the assumption he will do his own thing during the day or do I flat out say no on the principle of inviting himself along?
 


 
TL;DR – girlfriend’s dad invited himself along on 3 week tour of japan, said he would only be traveling with us not spending time with us during the day etc, girlfriend said she’d discuss with me and get back to him."
"I [30M] told the woman [25F] I love I have autism. This is what she said.


So I kind of hid my condition from her in the beginning and we began dating. She was perfect for me in every way. 

A few months in and I have told her about how I am on the spectrum. She said she always kind of knew and she loves me anyway, if not more so.

This was the message she sent me:

My heart breaks over the idea of not being with you. I crave you. It has nothing to do with being able to “have you”. I always think about how I can make you happy, take care of you, support you. I always think about how I can make you feel and know with utmost certainty how loved you are. I guess that’s why I randomly called you today asking all these stupid questions about Asperger’s. I’ve been thinking all day about how I could be the most caring and supportive person for you. Everything down to the way you like to be touched, the noises you’re comfortable around, how to speak clearly to you so as not to ever confuse you, how to give you a life where you could stress as little as possible... the list goes on. 

I feel so loved.

Tl;dr : I told the woman I love I have autism and she still loves me"
"I [24 F] do not want to go camping with my ex's [26 M] family [50s+] with my toddler. [1 F]


We planned this before my ex and I seperated. 

However, I then discovered he had a second cell phone, he was on snap chat after agreeing in couples counselling to not use it plus it said he was active on dating sites. I broke up with him. He left for his deployment with the navy, so now he's busy in Spain getting drunk and doing whatever. We're not in contact unless it's regarding our child.

It's been a month now. His mother messaged me saying she still expects me to go on this camping trip, and I don't want to anymore. Not only has his mother told everyone that we're separating, but she peddled his narrative that I'm controlling and crazy and he denied all of his sketchy behaviours such as sleeping around, calling his ex in the middle of the night, etc. I found out all of this from his aunt who was begging me to ""Stop trying to control ex"" and that ""it's so sad he had to lie to you to go be friends with other women"". After that, I stopped seeing them as allies and supportive family members, but rather people to only be civil with and kept at an arm's length because they are still my daughter's family. According to them, I'm crazy and broke her son's heart who could possibly do no wrong. He isn't even heartbroken, he's already seeing someone else and it further leads me to believe he was seeing her all along. Who knows, I stopped trying to understand him.

So this camping trip is coming up, and they messaged me saying they hope to see me there. Truthfully, I can't think of anything worse than chasing a toddler around a campground while still trying to maintain my composure since my family and home life just got nuked.  

I'm scared that this will already make a tense situation tenser. I do not want my ex-MIL to get on my back further, and if absolute need be I will shut her down and tell her just because her son isn't around to tell her to fuck off doesn't mean she can do/say whatever she wants. (One good quality about him, was that when she was trying to bully/steamroll me or be a passive aggressive jerk her son would tell her to stop and she would.) 

However, I'm still trying to settle custody/divorce proceedings so I don't want any drama either.

But the thought of going on this camping trip while trying to not cry to the point I scream, being around his senile grandmother who will constantly ask me how heartbroken am I that we broke up, and his passive-aggressive mother and enabling aunt all while trying to entertain a strong-willed toddler sounds like hell.

I don't know what to do. I feel lost. I just want to exist without people making my life harder than it already is.

TLDR. Passive-aggressive ex-MIL expects me to still go to family camping trip with a toddler around people who obviously dislike me, despite I'm separating, depressed and soon to be divorcing her son."
"I (29M) just ended my relationship with my gf/fiance (29F) of over 8 years. I gave her every chance I possibly could, and then some. this last chance was the final straw.


My life just got turned completely on its head. It always sucks to be pushed to the edge so many times, and still end up giving more and more chances. I mean, no one wants to give up on the one they love right? 

Everything used to be so great, picture perfect even. After 4 years, I asked her to marry me. It was the best day of my life. However, it quickly turned to the hardest 6-8 months I'd ever experienced. It was around September about 4 years ago. Everything was perfect, I had the woman, I had the happy home I had dreamed of. The next month, October, my Dad was told he had a brain tumor, which would be his second after 10 years from the last one. On top of that, I bestfriend of mine from another state, before we moved to where we live now, hung himself. I was devastated, recieving both the news within 2 days of each other. I shut down. I shut everyone out, including my fiance. Granted, I'm a really quiet person to begin with, but I didn't help that at all. Fast forward to Easter, I was deep in my job, working 60-70 hrs a week. I had still not really opened up to my fiance about how I'd been feeling, although she was well aware of why I was feeling so off for the last 4-5 months. Anyway, like I said, it was Easter, one of the busiest days where I worked. I was the closing manager, however, the mid shift manager offered to close up the place for me and give me a half day. Happy Easter. I head home, maybe 15 mins away. In park my car, pull out my apartment key and unlock the door. Huh, the deadbolt is locked. I knock. 30 seconds later, my fiance opens the door in all her nude glory. Happy Easter. She said she was just about to shower and that I should join her (which seemed odd, because her hair was obviously done up very nicely, just perfect flowing blonde locks.) We head to the bedroom so I may de-robe and get cleaned up. But something felt off. To preface this, my fiance was not necessarily the most tidy of people. Usually her clothes were strewn across the bedroom floor, but tonight was different. Tonight they were all gone. This immediately struck me as a little off. Then I noticed the closet door was closed, which was never the case. She kept trying to hurry me over to the shower, but I had to do something first. I opened the door, and I was greeted by all the clothes missing from the bedroom floor....as well as another man, naked....

Let me remind you, I'm generally a very calm person. But, you hear the expression all the time of people ""seeing red"". I certainly, however, did not inflict any harm to my fiance, I would never. But this guy? In my eyes, he's trespassing in the wrong place. I let him have it. To spare the details, I threw him out, as well as his phone and clothes over the balcony (he was thrown out the front door, no balcony involved).This is where I made the mistake. We talked/yelled things out. I stayed with her. For another 4 years.To cut this part short, we dealt with issues like this regularly for 6 months, such as me coming home and all her stuff being gone (she came back about a month later, to which I stupidly let her (even after catching her hanging out with this guy several times after)). 

And here we are today. My fiance's current job has her working long hours, and before you ask, of course I'm very low on the self confidence meter of my security in my relationship. So, of course, the wheels in my head turn day in and day out. ""Where is she really? Who is she really with?"" -these thoughts ran through my head constantly every day (an obvious ode to a failing relationship). Anyone who has been cheated on can certainly understand the thoughts that creep up from such things. 

Yesterday, she comes home about 1am, not irregular. But she immediately says she isn't feeling good and goes to the bathroom to throw up several times claiming she went with some co-workers for one drink. Something, again, seemed off to me. Later on, she passed out, and my anxiety and low sense of security in my relationship got the best of me. I went snooping through her bag/purse. I found a black notebook, as she is a ""write everything"" kinda person. I find a few pages mentioning camming on chaturbate. I also see her upcoming monthly schedule of things upcoming. I see several of the dates mentioning camming shows. But, what really got my was the ""sugardaddies"" rotation schedule. I couldn't believe what I was reading. How could I let something like this happen after everything. I had to wake her up, I couldn't keep this all bottled up. After a few mins of getting her fully awake, she, as per usual, denies, denies, denies. I tell her she's got one chance to work this out (more like 100th chance) by showing me her texts. I wanted to know exactly what I was working with here. Of course she wouldn't let me, and heads for the door. I tell her its over if she walks through that door without showing me her texts. She continues walking. She did end up coming back 15 mins later after presumably cooling off. I tell her ""last shot, let me see your texts"" she obliges and I see several guys she was talking too, sending them nudes and more nudes, with things like ""wow I had such a good time tonight, can't wait to see you again"" however after reading a couple, she snatches her phone. I'd had enough and told her to leave. She calls up a friend, they come back, and off she goes with about 90% of her stuff. An hour or two pass, I decide I need to go somewhere. Anywhere but here. I walk over to my car and my whole passenger side is destroyed and smashed up. I call her up, and guess what? Of course she denies it. Cops came, swabbed some blood off of one of the doors and are now hopefully going to get a spit swab from her to confirm or deny if it was her (more than likely she had someone else do it, she's a tiny girl and no way could she do all the damage that was done)

Sorry for the long wall, but to be honest, i really dont have anyone to talk to about this, so who better than internet strangers who have no direct involvement in my life I guess. 

Anyone else regret wasting so much time in someone after so many red flags??

I dont really know what it is I'm looking to get out of this post. This is the first time I've posted something like this. I'm just really tore up about all this and needed it get it out somewhere. No one will probably read this anyway...

Also this was all done quickly on my phone so hopefully it all makes sense to whomever reads it. 

TL;DR Fiance of 8 years cheated at year 4, stayed together  anyway, gets caught doing sugar baby BS and proceeds to destroy my car. What a lovely start to a day."
"My (30F) husband (32M) impulse bought a dog.


Together six years married for three. We so far have very rarely had communication issues. Before we got married we went to a counselor who helped us a lot; not because we were having issues, but to make sure we were going to be able to avoid these issues.

Both of us are childfree and have been talking about getting a dog. I grew up with them but we travel a lot, so having one has not really been in the cards. He recently took a job where we won’t be able to do as much traveling for about a year.

Recently he has been very excited because he feels he deserves a dog. He works away from home and I work from home. Like I said I grew up with dogs, I do miss having one. But there are dogs who would do great with out lifestyle and dogs who wouldn’t. We agreed on getting a trainer if we had any issues we can’t fix on our own.

I am very health conscious which extends to dogs. There are certain breeds I would never own because they have so many health issues.

The other day he came home with a bulldog puppy. This is a breed on my absolutely not list. He is about six months old and he got him from a family who couldn’t keep him. He is already has breathing issues, he snores all day and all night. He will need soft palate surgery and he will need his nostrils enlarged. He can’t run. He will need patella surgery. Like I said he is only six months old.

I am so frustrated. We’ve had the dog for about four weeks and he doesn’t want to walk the dog much, he won’t clean up after it, all he wants to do is take him to the dog park and pet store. He loves when people gush over how cute he is when he snorts (the dog not my husband).

We had a very big argument over the dog. He wants to let him sleep in bed with us, but I told him I would be sleeping in another room. He didn’t care, and the dog has been sleeping in our bed for the past three nights while I have been in the guest room.

During the day he is quiet. He is a good puppy for sure, he doesn’t destroy toys and he is happy as a clam to sleep next to me all day while I work. The snoring doesn’t bother me as much, but knowing he snores because he has that much trouble breathing makes me feel so bad.

but I am so upset with my husband for getting a dog with so many health issues. I do not know how to address the situation without letting my temper get away with me.

TL;DR: my husband brought home an impulse purchased puppy with numerous health issues, he won’t care for it, and it has taken over our bed."
"I (38m) asked out my ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend (34f) and now my ex is furious with me.


I broke up with my ex after a two-year relationship on the first Thursday in July, by Sunday she was hanging out with another guy who was a mutual acquaintance of ours and by the following weekend they were sending each other heart emojis and telling each other they miss each other. I still lived in her house while this was happening. I was able to find a new place and I moved out a couple of weeks after that. 

Here we are over a month later and I’m at a bar with friends when I randomly ran into his ex-girlfriend who I haven’t seen in over a year because that’s how long they’ve been broken up. We had a quick hug and a chat and she went on her way. Yesterday I decided to reach out to her and see if she wanted to catch up over drinks. Next thing I know I get an angry phone call from my ex saying how I’m tactless and tacky for going after her new boyfriend’s ex. 

I don’t think it’s any of their business and I am attracted to his ex but I can see how it may be perceived as spiteful. I just need some advice on what to say to my ex and what to do from here. His ex was receptive to my advance and we chatted for a while via text.

TL;DR: pretty much the title!"
"After running into one of my (24/M) superiors (28/F) on a night out, I drunkenly asked her out and now I don't know how to face or how to even begin to apologize at work today.


This happened two nights ago. I was out with friends for someone's birthday. We had a lot to drink. A few hours into the night I realized one of my coworkers was also there. She was the one who trained me on my first day and the one that I report to directly. Objectively speaking she's really attractive and very kind and patient. I respect and admire her a lot. At my other job people treated me like a piece of furniture but the people at this new office are really cool and supportive. I like it there a lot. 

Anyway I guess I do kind of have a crush on her but it's nothing that I had ever thought to act on. We work together. She probably views me as a child. There's no point in even thinking about it. When I'm at work, I focus on my tasks and that's it. Recently she told me that I've been doing a really good job and even invited me out for drinks with everyone else one night. I only had one beer. We mostly talked about work and this new show that we all like. It was fun. I got to know some of the people I work with. 

Then I fucked it all up this past weekend. I saw her at the pub that we were at. My friends encouraged me to go say hello. I was reluctant at first but I didn't want to be rude, especially after she saw me a couple of minutes later. I went over and said hello and we made smalltalk. She seemed like she was in a really good mood and she mentioned that she had taken my show recommendations seriously and had started watching this new one on Netflix that I had told her about before. I figured she would go back to her friends when she wanted to but she stayed around and we talked over by the bar for a good twenty or thirty minutes. 

I don't know. Maybe it was the drinks or maybe it was the fact that she kept laughing at my embarrassingly bad jokes. In my drunken mind I figured it was worth a shot to see if she was interested in grabbing coffee together one day. And so I asked her out and she went completely silent and just stared at me for a few seconds as if wondering whether this was a joke of some sort. As soon as it became clear that I wasn't joking, a couple of her friends came by and put an end to the awkwardness and made smalltalk with me. Oddly enough they had heard of me before. I guess she had told them about me when she was still training me. 

But that was basically how it ended. I just stood around and talked to them for a bit and then I went back to my friends to tell them what happened. Although she didn't actually give me an answer with words, it was pretty clear that her answer would have been no if her friends hadn't interrupted. Now it's the start of our work week. We had a long weekend, so this is going to be the first time I've seen her since that night. I really don't know what to do or how to act around her. Clearly I fucked up pretty bad. Should I apologize? Should I act like nothing happened unless she brings it up? 

What should I do? 

**tl;dr** We had a long weekend, so today is going to be really awkward as we haven't seen or talked to each other since that night. Should I apologize or should I pretend nothing happened unless she brings it up?"
"My (21F) girlfriend is considering leaving me (25M) because I might have a hereditary genetic disorder


Please bear with me as I'm not in the best headspace right now and this might seem jumbled, but I will do my best.

A little over a month ago so ago we returned back from a holiday overseas, as most couples do when they're boxed in they argue a little because they aren't used to spending 24/7 in eachothers pockets. Whilst on the trip she mentioned that I should start doing more at home which I agreed on as I know I can be lazy sometimes and felt she was being reasonable as I could see it from her perspective. Upon returning home I picked up my game and did what she asked because upon reflection it didn't seem fair that I didn't help out as much as I did.   


I still felt like there was something off about her, like she wasn't being completely honest with me. I have a pretty good indication as to when she's not be completely honest, but I don't force it out of her if she doesn't want to talk.  I asked for a couple of weeks if she was okay, if work was stressing or out, maybe she was getting harassed while walking home again and she didn't want to tell me as I would get upset (unfortunately this happens alot from where we're from). She told me she was fine/okay and that work was just busy. I reassured her that if she needed to talk she knew where I was, rubbed her hand and kissed her forehead.

Anyway, fast forward until the 14th July. We were lying in bed, just lounging and I could see that something was off.  
So I asked again if she was okay and she broke into tears, saying that one of her friends had just recently passed away unexpectedly and she felt crushed. So I laid there with her, scratching her head and holding her like anyone would.  
Then out of nowhere, and I can't express this enough she says that's not all that's wrong. I asked her if everything was okay and like always she could tell me anything.

She tells me that she has been thinking over the last month or so about how I could have a hereditary genetic disorder and that she doesn't think she would be able to stick around later in life. I was, completely shocked. I don't think I can accurately describe how I was feeling other than being completely shocked. When we first started dating I told her that there is a 50/50 chance that I could have this HGD (Hereditary Genetic Disorder), and that my body would start to shut down in 20 - 25 years (if it was confirmed that I have it). As much as I would like to mention what disease it is to you all, I know a few of my friends and possibly hers may read this and I would rather not be linked back. Basically there is no known cure, only medication that can provide relief.

*I didn't introduce her to my family for a little while because my father isn't in the best of health (he has the HGD also), sometimes it's hard to understand what he says, he has issues walking, grabbing things etc. This is caused by the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. It's also alot to take in for someone who hasn't experienced someone in this condition before. I love my Dad, but it's hard sometimes to judge how someone else is going to react and I didn't want to stress him out. (Side information)*  


So after she mentioned that she didn't know if she would be able to handle if I had the condition in 20 odd years, she told me that she didn't want to be financially burdened, she didn't want to be saving for a house right now, she wants to go out and party and enjoy herself, she didn't want our kids to have to go through the same thing that I went through growing up (I was 17 by the time I found out and my father wasn't really around due to his job, but whatever) and that she didn't want to give up life to care for me full time. *(I have never once stopped her from making her own choices, I only ever asked if she was going out to let me know when she was leaving and to not walk back home alone in the dark.)*

  
I was, shocked to say the least. I spoke with her for months in the beginning, making sure that she was okay with it all and if she had any doubts that it would be best for us to call it off now.

I asked her if she really meant all the things she said at the beginning of the relationship, which included not giving up when things got rough, talking to each other when either of us seemed upset, till death do us part kinda talk. And yes, although we aren't married it's been a discussion that we've always been open and honest about. We both agreed in the beginning if we weren't serious in the long term for marriage, kids etc then the relationship shouldn't ago ahead.    
She told me that she meant it at the time, and now she doesn't know if she can follow through.

I was always going to get the test eventually before we started to try for kids, that's not something I would even consider doing to them just for the sake of conceiving children naturally. I just really didn't want to know right now, because if I do have the disorder (50/50 chance) it's not easy to take in.

So without telling her to begin with, I organise to go and see a Dr to see how lengthy the wait would be to have this test done. Waited a few days, and get a call back to come in. I get a referral to see a geneticist and have the blood test. I'm petrified of needles and I'm not too fond on finding out if I have this condition. (Just to also add, I have known about this for almost 10 years know and so far I cannot see any signs of it developing).

So a week or so goes by and after we discussed that I would get the test in a couple of months as I have some pretty serious work commitments right now (need to be in the right headspace) she says that she doesn't know if she can wait that long. Again, I am utterly gutted. It seems that every time we stop talking about it that day, a couple of days later some other issue comes up and then I get told ""Oh well I didn't think of it then"". (Frustrating, but nothing I can do there).

So as of last week, I organised the blood test and went in (I was alot calmer and it went as well as a blood test can).  
I told her a few days before going to get the test that it would be happening. She tells me *""well you don't want to know right now so why are you getting it done so soon?*"" I tell her back *""Because if I don't get the test, you won't wait around. And if I get the test and find out I do have it, you said you can't handle it and would leave anyway. I can't continue to put myself through the uncertainty.""*  
Jump forward again to 2 nights ago, she tells me on the couch that she doesn't know if she can wait until the end of the month to find out and now she doesn't know what she wants to do (leave or stay and find out the results).  


Let me also add, that I did all this for her and the relationship. I didn't exactly want to find out now, but I told her in the beginning (of us dating) that I would do anything for her and this includes that. She asked if I would be okay with finding out the result, I told her I didn't know. How is one meant to react to knowing their mortal lifespan will be reduced by 20 years? 

I would do anything for her, and now I don't know how I feel. I understand her side, but I can't help but feel like this whole situation is just a cop out. I know I should look out for my own health, but I love her. I don't know how someone can go from being completely honest with you, to this.

I'm not really asking for advice here reddit, though feel free to share your thoughts below. I'm just gutted and needed a place to vent. 

There's probably a bunch of information I've left out (not intentionally), so I'm sorry if some of the post doesn't make sense. 

  
TLDR: My girlfriend of 2 years wants to leave me based on a hereditary genetic disorder (that I could have) that I told her about when we started dating, and it's now become an issue because she doesn't want to look after me later in life.

Additional notes for the TLDR: I'm currently awaiting the results, I should find out by the end of the month."
"My [36F] wife says she [35F] only loves me as a brother


Dear smart people of Reddit, i'm in need of some ideas/support/advice/help/real talk/whatever you can give me. 

My wife and I have been dating since we were finishing School. We got married at 23 and 24 respectively and had our first kid at 26. We then relocated a few years later to a city where we had no friends and then had twins. After the twins came life was very tough and the romance began to die between us. We would fight a lot and it culminated in me moving out when the kids were over a year old. I got involved with someone else for a while and hid it from my wife. I then realised that what I really wanted was her and we worked on reconciling which we did do. 

Since then we've had many ups and downs - we went through phases of being very close and others being distant and arguing a lot. We did however have many good times and I was particularly honest and careful in how i communicated with her since the separation. 

We have since relocated for a job that contains a lot of stress for her and she told me a while ago that she doesnt love me anymore (only like a brother) and doesnt know what she wants in terms of the relationship. We have both started therapy again and are now working through our own issues (separately) for her to figure out what she wants and for me to break my co-dependency on her (and to find myself again). She subsequently asked for a separation and I moved into the guest room. This isnt ideal but its the best we can do considering where we live (and the restrictions living here), with the alternative being me being an hour away in the closest town. So for the sake of the kids and our own sadness we agreed that this is an acceptable solution so that I can still be around and involved in their lives. 

My wife travels extensively for work and she says that she really needs and wants me around, both for her and the kids. We have spoken and agreed that we'd love to remain best friends through all of this (she's been my best friend for over 20 years), regardless of what happens. So for now I'm in this weird limbo state. I am a very affectionate person and am craving an honest embrace, or a cuddle - so I go through ups and downs (as can be expected). 

We're trying to do weekly date nights (schedules permitting), and im trying desperately to connect with her. She is the love of my life and hindsight has taught me that I dont want anyone else besides her. She says she doesnt feel the same and doesnt think she ever will, but she is working through her own issues (childhood, work and relationship wise), before she says she would feel ready to make a decision.

So my questions are:

1. Any advice on what I could do to try convince her she wants to be with me?
2. How could I rebuild the closeness/intimacy we once had (physical intimacy would be great,  but not all im after)
3. How could I support her better than I do now? Would it help or is my help pushing her further away. She says that i'm hovering (im desperately trying not to), but this proves hard at times. 
4. I've started preparing myself mentally for the fact that this will end, and that she is going to come to that conclusion soon. This thought kills me  and is the absolute last thing I want. Any advice on this? 

Then i'm open to any advice that people have in this regard, similar situations etc. I want nothing more than to go back to the relationship  we once had, with her being loving and affectionate towards me.

There are many other details I can give if needed, things we've tried etc, but i'd be writing forever if I had to list everything. 

TL/DR - Wife of almost 13 years has asked for a separation and doesnt feel she loves me as anything more than a brother and doesnt know if that would change ever. This has left me down and desperate to be able to fix it."
"My (M23) girlfriend (F23) went to a bachelorette party and it’s freaking me out


We were at dinner with the bride a week after and a girl, say Beth, with the same name was mentioned. They were talking about how understanding the stripper was with Beth. How when he put his junk in her face she backed off and he did too. When my buddy asked if it was my Beth that they were talking about they said no and had an alarming look on their face and looked at me. As if saying “no your Beth went wild.” Now this happened awhile ago and recently I’ve told my gf about how weird I feel about some of the comments she’s made in the recent weeks before that. She told me that being insecure was unattractive and to stop being so sensitive. So I didn’t say anything. Should I approach her about this bachelorette party? Or would it start some unnecessary fight? Am I being too insecure here? I’d really appreciate any help. Thanks so much. 

Edit: The “joking” comments she made were along the lines of “I can look through your phone but you can’t look through mine,” “Why don’t you look like that(when I pointed out how muscular a dude was),” and “if you want to fuck other people it’s fine I trust you, as long as I can do it too.”

TL;DR: My girlfriend went to a bachelorette party and her friends made her seem like she was going wild with the stripper. Should I confront her?"
"Husbamd recorded me during a fight


I need a gut check here.

My husband (35m) and i (32f) have a recurring theme of him invalidating and/or dismissing my feelings, and to no surprise, its caused a lot of problems. In fact, we are now in counseling together. We have been together for 7 years, married for 5.

I also believe that one of my husbands defense tactics to avoid being at fault is to say that a situation didnt happen, that im misremembering, or somehow otherwise paint a picture such that he couldnt have done what upset me so that logically, i am incorrect for being upset. Yes, i know thats manipulation and not ok.

Last night, we were arguing. Him about the toilet (which was the topic that started the argument), and me abput how i feel like he denies my feelings, and about standing up for my feelings. The more he denies and invalidates, the angrier i get. Typically i end up in tears and we dont speak the rest of the day, sometimes it spans multiple days. It can easily ruin a whole weekend.

Shockingly, for the first time, last night he got out his phone and started recording me. I knew, although he didnt tell me. He immediately changed his behavior, the tone of his voice, everything. I was seeing red and asked him, ""what are you going to do with it, if he wanted to show his friends to tell them how crazy i was? Because thats disrespectful. To post on social media? Thats even worse. To show our counselor to prove some point?"" He replied that he wanted us to be able to see who is at fault. I left the room, slamming the door of our bedroom. 

What happened next was that he followed me into the bedroom, and when he opened the door i asked what he wanted. He started with some story of events that was inaccurate and at one point i said ""leave."" He kept on with this newfangled story of events and i said ""are you seriously going to sit there and act like you werent just yelling at me, didnt say 'nonono you cant say that' or anything? Get out!"" An I moved his arm out of the doorway slammed the door in his face.

I heard him say ""now shes put her hands on me"" and stop recording. Later, he had locked himself into our guest room and said he didnt feel right. For the first time, we slept apart.

So tell me....what do you make of this?

Tl;dr: my husband recorded me during a fight, completely changing his behavior, and i need a gut check on what just happened."
"My boyfriend (23M) complains daily about his life and I'm (27F) sick of nagging him to do the basic things necessary to fix it.


Yes, there's an age gap. I'm sure that comes into play here, but I've also met many 23-year-old guys who have their shit together AND older men who are incredibly messy, so it's not entirely that. My BF is a lovely person, fun to be around when out and about, the sex is amazing, but he constantly complains that he's not happy where he is or how things are. I then make suggestions for small things he could do to help himself, for example:

1. He did a three-year degree, part of which was overseas. He finished his last subject in June 2018. All he needs to do is make one call to his university to make sure the overseas credit is transferred so he can graduate. This has not happened in 12 months and he still has not technically finished the degree he worked on for three years. I have offered to make this call numerous times on his behalf and he gets annoyed and tells me to leave it.
2. In the last year and a half, he has worked for a total of two months. The rest of the time he has lived off his savings, and then his parents, and now a government dole. Daily I ask him if he has looked for jobs and again, he gets annoyed and tells me he's been looking and to leave him do it.
3. We're living in a city where we can take public transport everywhere and always have without issue but will soon be moving to a smaller town where driving is necessary. As such I've been taking driving lessons to get my licence and saving to buy a car. He keeps saying 'you can drive me to work and pick me up if it's late', 'when we move and you buy a car we can go on roadtrips' etc. If he was making some sort of effort this wouldn't be an issue but there's just this expectation that I'll be driving both of us around because I'm the one bothering to sort this out.
4. I've asked him infinite times to see a mental health professional because I think that might help and if we scream and fight he says he'll do it the next day (""if you find me someone good and send me their information"") but it has never happened.

His parents have taken to just calling me directly to ask how he's going and honestly I hate that. (He doesn't have a working phone and hasn't bought a new one in a month). They tell me they're grateful I'm looking after him. When I tell him this stuff he doesn't respond, just goes quiet and says nothing like he's hoping this will pass. Recently I've started to lose my sex drive because I feel like the mom of a bratty teenager. 

At the same time, I have to acknowledge that to him, it must appear that I'm nagging him constantly about things he doesn't think are important at all. He talks about opening a restaurant and starting a farm and these massive things without being able to get his phone fixed, so I focus on small things like that, and he becomes irritated. 

Does anyone have advice about how I can move him towards taking care of these things himself? My therapist said to literally just drop it and ignore it and focus on having fun and my own shit, and if his life turns into chaos then he'll figure out he's the one to have caused it but a) I love him and it hurts to see him hurt, b) if his life turns to chaos it inevitably affects mine because I'm the one he AND his family come to for answers and emotional support, and c) how can I plan a future with someone who won't even let me into his bedroom because it's 'messy' but it has NEVER not been messy? I know that's such a small thing but I'm 27, I eventually want to get married and settle down and I feel as though he'll sort out his stuff when he's older but I don't know that I can wait until then.

**TL;DR:** I nag boyfriend to do things to help himself (call his university to get his degree finished, get a job after 1.5 years, see a mental health professional) but he won't do anything. His parents now call me to check up on him. Is there another way to help him, or not really? My therapist says to stop caring about his behaviour &amp; focus 100% on myself."
"My [23M] friend [26M] doesn't think anyone has a right to complain because he survived a plane crash


My friend survived a major plane crash a few years ago and has turned into a total prick. Anytime someone is venting about their life he has to interject with ""I survived a plane crash motherfucker"" followed by some vague zen hippy love live laugh nonsense and ""drink water and workout."" I mean, I get it. Stubbing your toe isn't the same as surviving a plane crash but it's really shitty to play down someone else's problems. My mom might have cancer and I was talking to another friend about this. He overheard and chimed in with the plane crash thing as usual. Then said my mom needs to just eat better and stop worrying. I got pissed and told him off. He did apologize to me later but I'm still mad.

He's a good friend in other ways but this issue makes him a real d-bag. How do I get him to realize that he's being rude?

TL;DR My friend trivializes other people's problems because he survived a plane crash"
"My (17/M) parents’ (48/F) (48/M) newfound open marriage has turned our family into the town laughing stock.


Basically my mum was cheating on my dad. He found out. They were separated for a couple of months and then they started going to couples therapy. After that they sat me down and told me that they were going to try and make it work. But they still weren’t going to be living together quite yet. I didn’t know what to make of the situation. I just nodded and carried on with the things in my life that were steady. School, hockey, my friends, etc. 

It was weird to me that my dad wasn’t living with us. I understood they needed space from each other to try and figure things out individually as well as together.  But he was around the house everyday. He just didn’t sleep here. Soon enough I found that he was seeing someone. One of my friends saw him with a random woman at a restaurant in the next city over. My first thought was that he was just trying to get back at my mum for cheating and hadn’t told her. Or maybe she knew. I didn’t know, and I felt that I had the right to know in case I was ambushed again with information that was new to me. I asked them about if. They were hesitant at first, but they eventually explained to me that they’ve decided to have an open marriage. 

I knew what that was. But it didn’t feel like it was the right thing to do. I told them that they should just get a divorce if they want to go out with other people. We live in a small town. Word gets around here. It’s not okay to play house and to pretend everything is okay when it’s convenient and then to sneak around with other people when they know people here talk. Maybe it wasn’t my place to say that, but I could tell from the way they had explained things that they weren’t doing the whole open marriage thing in order to repair what was broken. It was just a distraction to a problem that they knew they couldn’t fix. 

Anyway I distanced myself from both of them. Pretty much all summer, I’ve been focusing on my part-time job and my friends. Then a few weeks ago someone in town saw my mum with another man at some pub. It all sort of came to a head after that. People in town started talking. The open marriage became known. And now I can’t go anywhere without people making snarky and underhanded remarks about my family. I can handle it now, but when school starts it’s going to be a different story. I can’t just avoid these people. It sucks. Although I’m not “blaming” my parents for it, I do think they were irresponsible and inconsiderate of the third person in this family (me, their seventeen year old son) when they decided to do this. They said they were going to be careful, but they haven’t. And now everyone knows. 

I can hardly wipe down a table at the café without people saying shit to me. The things they say about my mum in particular, it’s horrible. I feel bad for her more than I do my dad, because the people here are backwards and have small town mentality about women. But the whole situation is fucked up for all of us all around and I don’t know what to do. 

It hasn’t died down at all. 

**tl;dr** We live in a small town. People find out about the open marriage. Now I can hardly work my part-time job without people saying shit. I don’t know what to do or where to direct my frustration."
"My [26F] future SIL [23F] is cutting me out of the upcoming wedding because someone is impersonating me on Facebook


I'm using a throwaway because this is too trivial to be linked to my main account.


My twin brother [26M] is getting married in a couple of months to his girlfriend of 3 years. They met at work, in the job that my brother got when he moved away after finishing university. I am unsurprisingly close to my brother, but haven't really got much in common with his future wife - we're cordial with each other, but our likes and interests are totally opposite, so we're not on the path to being best friends.


I have not used Facebook since I was 15. I didn't like the random messages I got from creepy older guys who hit me up because I was an early bloomer and looked older than I was, plus it was before this modern age of online support, so there was a lot of 'shaming' and 'calling out', which I didn't like to see. When WhatsApp became a thing I started to use that, alongside texting, to talk to friends, and aside from a couple of comments from newer friends or colleagues about not being able to find me on Facebook, it hasn't become an issue in my life, until now.


My future sister in law knew from an early point that I didn't have Facebook, as she mentioned about me not being tagged in a picture my mother put up of the family at an event during one of the first times we met, and I reiterated the reasons above as to why I didn't use it. I know that she is into her social media and has a following on her Instagram (I have never had that either), but she seemed to understand my reasoning. I didn't realise it was an issue until I got a call from my mother a few weeks ago saying that FSIL had called her up in tears saying that I was purposefully ignoring everything in the wedding group chats and Facebook pages, and it was creating issues, so much so that she'd replaced me as a bridesmaid, because I wasn't attending any of the fittings. I was never asked to be a bridesmaid! My mother apparently told her that there must've been some kind of crossed wires as I haven't been on Facebook for years, however a few days later my brother showed her 'my' new Facebook profile that I had supposedly set up just to be involved in the wedding - this profile was indeed included in chats and groups, but I was definitely not the one to create it. The only friend the profile had was my FSIL, and apart from that it was totally empty. I don't want to suggest that she was the one who created the profile, but it was not me in any way, shape, or form.


I messaged FSIL saying that there was some kind of massive mistake, both for the Facebook and for me being asked to be a bridesmaid in the first place, but got a reply saying that she knows that she asked me, and if I was to continue being 'difficult' then she and my brother would have no choice but to ban me from attending. I was shocked, as none of this was something I knew I was involved in. I requested that FSIL message me separately if there was anything she believed I was to be involved in other than the wedding, and she said she would.


I wouldn't be posting here if something else hadn't happened. Yesterday, again, FSIL rang my mother to say that since 'I' hadn't responded about the batchelorette weekend that had been planned for months, she had lost the deposit, and needed me to pay out £250 for 'my' place on this weekend that I could no longer attend. No one had mentioned it to me, again, plus I had assumed in the first place I wouldn't be invited since we're hardly close. My mother, knowing the situation, stuck up for me, saying that she knew I hadn't received anything via WhatsApp or other, non social media communication, since we'd chatted the night before the situation and how FSIL hadn't talked to me since the first issue. FSIL apparently said that since she 'knows' I am in fact in control of the Facebook account she found since that account was 'seeing' all of the messages, and if I didn't pay then I could kiss my invite to the wedding goodbye. I quickly got on to my brother and FSIL in a group text saying that, again, I was not in charge of the Facebook account, but if that was the straw that broke the camel's back then I wouldn't attend. My brother knew nothing about the batchelorette or the money, and said that there was no way my invite would ever be rescinded, while FSIL stayed quiet.


I'm thinking that this is less about me not using Facebook and more about the bride trying to save face when being asked why I'm not a part of the wedding other than a guest (which I really don't mind), but these comments are painting me as the villain in a narrative I didn't even know existed until a few weeks ago. I am convinced something else will happen soon regarding 'me' on Facebook - do I get ahead of it and tell FSIL that I suspect she is making everything up?


TL;DR - I haven't used Facebook in over a decade, yet my future sister in law is on the verge of banning me from her wedding to my brother since an account with my name on it is seemingly ruining everything (I suspect FSIL to be behind it all)."
"My husband (28) wants me to lose weight but is emotionally and verbally abusive about it


We are in a new city &amp; state visiting and have to leave tonight. I wanted to visit a really nice mall and on our way here, he says “that girl isn’t wearing a bra.” I got angry and asked what business was he has looking at a girls tits. He said “I wasn’t checking her out I was just saying.”

So I remained angry and said I’m not going to the mall anymore to which he replied “fuck you.” Then said “why shouldn't I look? You don’t take care of yourself, she does apparently.” That did it for me.

I know I’m acting childish but I got really upset that he was looking at another girl that way and then ends it with a remark about my weight I started balling my eyes out and 1 hour later I’m still crying sitting in the car as he and baby stroll the mall I wanted to go to.

I had a baby 1 year ago, I’m 5’3 and 150lbs — just to paint a picture of how fat I am.

This is not an uncommon type of argument. He often comments on my weight saying he needs an attractive wife. I feel that in the very beginning of my relationship when I was in much better shape he was less ugly to me.

Other than lose weight which I’m trying, what to do? I know I’m shooting myself in the foot by robbing myself of this fun experience I could be having but instead self loathing in a car. I hate acting childish and sensitive. I hate that Im not losing weight fast enough. It’s hard. Everything’s hard.

Tl;dr
Husband wants me to lose weight but he’s rude AF about it I get insensitive and childish and ruin my own damn day even when out on vacation."
"Me (29F) walking away from my husband whenever he embarrasses me in public


This has became a recurring dynamic between me and my husband. We're outside anywhere, I say something, it sets my husband off, and normally if this occurred at home the argument will probably be over in a different way.

&amp;#x200B;

But because we're in public, my husband takes the arguments in a whole new level. He shouts loudly so everyone can hear, he makes a scene, he walks up to me as if he'll hit me, he slams the door of the car, then if I try and talk to him back, he'll walk away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

When this happens, I feel he's trying to control me, by publicly embarrassing me so that I back off, but what happens is that I feel anger and I take the control back by removing myself from the situation, NO MATTER where we are or what will happen if I walk away, I just walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, he drives I don't, he has a car I don't, so whenever he does this to me in public, I just walk off, I walk to home, it doesn't matter if I'm 10 minutes away or 1 hour away. I feel some sort of my control is back after I do this.

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing that happens, is he gives me the silent treatment, sometimes he'll try talking to me, but he'll never address what happened or apologies for what he did, so I basically give him the silent treatment back, and I refuse to talk to him as long as he wants to brush this under the rug and isn't willing to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few days I end up giving up and making up with him without real promise of never doing this again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sick of this, I keep my 1 years old baby out of this drama, but he clearly sometimes see things he shouldn't be seeing, like mom and dad not talking for days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point of completely resenting my husband and having a lot of anger towards him. When he's not like this he's loving and joking around and all is good, but this pattern just keeps happening at least once a week with the silence stretching sometimes to 4 days at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

It's exhausting, being  the sole breadwinner in this marriage is exhausting, especially with his behavior because when this does happen I fail to perform well at my work.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, our last fight started when I said, it's 3 PM, I have a call at 4PM, in which he reacted with anger and frustration, which got me angry, it's not like I choose to work at 4PM (problem is also I work from home), so it feels like he's punching me to have to work. I feel that in our relationship I do most of the work and that he's useless, but I can't just stay because my child loves his father. They can have a relationship, but it doesn't mean I have to stay in the marriage, I feel it's more damaging for my baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit you're always pessimistic in your advice, I know most will say leave, I wish I can hear some sort of different advice, like how to handle his impulsive anger moments? Am I doing the right thing? Sorry if all this sounded like a rant.

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR: my husband impulsive angry and embarrassing in public, I simply walk away, but this never stops, followed by silent treatment for a few days, I'm exhausted and lost at what to do to end this pattern."
"I [21F] am so bored, my boyfriend [28M] never wants to do anything.


My boyfriend [28M] and I [21F] have been together for three years. I have been so bored lately I contemplate just ending our relationship all the time. I don't want to do that because I love him, but he literally never wants to do anything. I only see him on the weekends, so when I come up he usually just wants to make food, watch something, or play video games. I am seriously so bored. 

I always suggest doing things, and I have made it very apparent that I'm starting to get irritated by it. We go out to eat sometimes, but I dont really count that, that is just eating in a different area. He always says ""we need to save money"" but it really is not expensive to do something once every other weekend or so. I suggest so many things, and he always says ""next weekend"" and then next weekend comes around and he says ""next weekend"" again. 

I am just so bored of staying home every single weekend, I just turned 21 and I am a fairly adventurous person. I feel myself turning into an old person. I don't know what to do. I have talked about it with him so many times and he's just like ""break up with me if you aren't happy then."" Does anyone have any suggestions? Or do you think it's just time to end the relationship because we have different interests? 

If I should break up with him, how should I do it? I love him but our interests are so different. I don't want to hurt him, and I am also scared I will regret it since I love him.

TL;DR: Boyfriend [28M] and I [21F] have been together for 3 years. All he likes to do is stay at home, I like doing things. I am starting to get really bored and frustrated. Should I break up with him?"
"Will it ruin his (23M) life if I (33F) agree to date him?


I am completely torn between the two outcomes and would appreciate any advice.

My background: I was married to my best friend pretty early. We both had abusive parents and didn’t think we were capable of “normal” love but we thought we’d build a good life together. We did. He died 8 years ago and I still miss him.

Since then, I’ve dated for fun and to enjoy sex but I’ve always been clear that I’m not interested in relationships in the long-term. I have a solid social circle, a good job with great people, and a decent relationship with my family (which is much more than I ever thought I’d have.) I live in a big city and I only go into the office for ten hours on an average week; the rest of the work I do is on my own time. I haven’t ever felt lonely or unfulfilled, really. I was content to live this way and, if I do, I’ll consider it a good life.

Three years ago, a friend introduced me to a hobby that involves people meeting up online once per week. (I’m not going to say what it is because this is already obvious enough. I don’t mind if he sees this but I also don’t want to broadcast it.) It wasn’t my normal thing but I participated the first time as a favor and had a lot of fun. I got more involved, made friends that I’ve met in person since then, and now I do this twice per week most weeks.

One of the people I met was a friend a friend of my friend. He was a 21-year-old guy who seemed nice and normal. He was finishing up college. I didn’t have a major impression of him beyond that. But he was studying something relevant to my friend and asked one day if I’d mind chatting with him and going over a presentation. I did. We ended up having a nice time talking and I started occasionally giving him a second opinion on his work.

Six months later, we were actual friends. We’d progressed to talking daily, video chatting on occasion, playing silly games together, and things like that. When he came to my city with some friends on a trip, we met for dinner and then again for lunch before he left. It was really fun! If I’m being honest with myself, I could tell I had a bit of a crush on him but I figured it would pass and I was being silly.

The talking increased. I think we know everything about each other now and I can’t explain how compatible we are. We told me about a year ago that he has feelings for me and I told him I did, too, but he was too young. We tabled it and kept living our normal lives. I had to go to a city near him for work for two weeks and he drove up and spent that time with me. We continued talking every day. 

He approached me a few days ago and said that we need to clear some things up. He’s graduating at the end of the year and has to choose where to live. He wants to move to my city, get a place (of his own), and for us to start dating officially. He said that he’s in love with me and that the age difference doesn’t bother him. He said that he hasn’t felt this way about someone before and that he would be happy to see us married down the road.

I am in love with him. That kind of love I didn’t think I could feel for someone. He is intelligent and clever and funny and kind. But I am ten years older than he is. His upbringing was pretty traditional and happy. Mine was awful. He’s just starting on his post-college life while I have already established my life in a way that made me happy. I feel awful that I let this go on for so long when I knew from the first time I thought to myself that I liked talking to him that he was too young for me to be so close to. 

I feel like me saying yes and agreeing to date him will ruin his life. I know he wants to have kids and I’m getting older. I would have children with him if the timelines aligned but how can they? He will miss out on dating in his early 20’s and having the opportunity to be with more age-appropriate women. (He’s been in two relationships in the past. One was 2 years in high school and the other was four years at the end of high school and through college. It ended at the beginning of his senior year. He's almost done with grad school now.) I feel that as we get older, he’ll regret us being a couple because of our age difference.

If I was 25, I’d say yes in a heartbeat. I’d be over the moon. But I’m not 25 and I feel like I need to be the responsible one. I’m looking for any advice or experience or anything that might help me figure out what to do. Of course I want to be with him. How ever the most important thing in the situation is that I do what’s right for him. 

Thanks in advance. 

tl;dr I’m too old for the guy I’m in love with and I’m worried that it would be better for his life if I said that we can’t be together. What should I do?"
"I (M28) have been told by my mother than I will have to come back from my honeymoon if my grandma's condition deteriorates


Hi all. Using a throwaway account as some of my family are on here. My wife and i have been married since October last year and have been planning our month long honeymoon  for the past 6 months and have probably spent close to 15k. All tours, accommodation, activities are booked and ready to go. We are in Australia and travelling to Europe for the first time.

My grandmother has been admitted to hospital for the past \~2 months with an autoimmune condition which is attacking her arteries. She seems to be stable or somewhat improving at the moment thankfully.

I was on the phone to my mother this morning who has always been somewhat controlling of my life and she said that she needs to know all the details of my trip and how to contact me in case my grandma deteriorates. If so I will have to come back home. Due to the relationship with my mum, i somewhat agreed/brushed it off.

I am quite close to my grandma and have been throughout my life however i don't want to seem callous, but i don't want to necessarily come home if she deteriorates. I have invested hundreds of hours of work creating this once in a lifetime trip and a lot of money. My grandma has ample family and support around her through this time and i'm not sure how my presence or lack thereof will change that.

If it came to the end of the trip and I knew she was deteriorating, i would go straight from the airport to the hospital to see her.

Am i in the wrong to feel this way? How should i go about talking with my mother if the time came?

TLDR: My mother said that i would HAVE to come home from a month long honeymoon half way across the world if my grandma's condition deteriorates."
"My [21F] best friend's [20f] boyfriend [23M] frightened me and it led to him getting in a fight with my own boyfriend [24m]. Now my best friend is angry at me and I'm worried for her and its all just a mess.


Alright, I'll try to keep this as brief as I can but it may go long.

My best friend is Maria. She and I met two years ago when I moved to my current city for school and we've been friend since then. We were like sisters. We did everything together, slept over at each others homes almost all the time.

In the last few months she and I have both gotten into relationships. I was the first, meeting my boyfriend (Charlie) a little over six months ago. 

She met her own boyfriend (Jeremy) about four months ago. 

With us both in new relationships we weren't hanging out as often. I've felt kind of bad for that lately, and I have been asking Maria if she'd like to do something together. She has given me a lot of kind of noncommittal responses.

Finally a couple weeks ago she asked me if Charlie and I would like to rent out a cabin in a local state park with her and Jeremy. I was initially just a bit put-off by that because none of us are really outdoorsy people who rent out cabins in the wilderness, but I was excited at the chance to spend time with my bestie so I talked Charlie into it and we rented out the cabin for two nights over last weekend.

I was excited but it wound up being a way more strange experience then I was hoping for. I haven't really spent any time around Jeremy before and I didn't really care for the vibe he put off.

We all were trying to hang out together and enjoy our time and it seemed like Jeremy was not interested in talking to us and was constantly making excuses to try and be off by himself. I assumed he was nervous about being around new people or something and tried to be friendly but he didn't seem to show any interest.

Anyway, the second day we were out there I had sent Charlie on a beer run, while I was kind of gathering our stuff together to make sure we'd be good to leave the next morning. 

Jeremy came and stood in the doorway all of a sudden. I looked at him and asked if everything was okay and he told me he was fine. 

I didn't like the way he was standing in the doorway and not saying anything, and I asked him if there was anything I could help him with. He said no. Then he told me I looked pretty. 

That was the last straw and I wound up quietly pulling out my phone and telling Charlie to drop whatever he is doing and come back to the cabin. With that sent I asked Jeremy to please quit standing in the doorway and I told him that Maria was probably outside.

He didn't move from the doorway and acted offended and started asking me what is wrong. I was getting agitated and frightened and I kept telling him to move out of the doorway. He started getting pissy and snapped that he was just trying to be friendly, I told him I just wanted him to move out of my way. I started texting Charlie that Jeremy had me blocked in our room and wouldn't move.

I don't know how long that took but Charlie finally got back. As soon as he heard the car Jeremy finally back off of the door. Charlie came running in and found me to ask what happened. I was just telling him everything that went down, Jeremy was hovering in the background and started saying stuff like ""That isn't what happened"". Somewhere around here Maria reappeared from wherever she had been all day.

Charlie got pissed and confronted him and they started yelling at each other. And then a second later they were fighting. I don't know who started what or anything, but Maria and I got them to break it up and pulled our respective guys away from one another. I took Charlie in the bedroom and the two of us very quickly decided it was time for us to leave the cabin. 

We told Maria and Jeremy we were leaving and we tok off as soon as we got all of our stuff loaded.

I wound up staying the night at Charlie's because I was still pretty shook up from the incident before.

After a night I decided to call Maria and figure out where we stood. She didn't answer when I tried to call her and ignored my messages at first, but she finally answered me with ""leave me alone.""

I did as she asked for a little while but as I thought about what happened with Jeremy I started getting worried a little bit.

I wound up messaging her again that I was sorry how things had gone down on our trip but her boyfriend had shown some worrying traits to me and I just wanted to let her know she can always message me if she needs anything.

She replied back that I didn't need to worry for her, and she has not communicated with me since then.

I'm very sad and worried for her. She has been my best friend since well before the guys came into our lives, it hurts being told not to call her. Ive never had a friendship end in anger and it really hurts my heart that I might not get to see her again. She was like a sister to me.

And I'm also worried. I guess it may not have been a big deal in the grand scheme of things but the way her boyfriend blocked me in a room and wouldn't move has me extremely concerned for her. I mean, maybe it was nothing but maybe it was something and I don't know what to do about it.

Is my friendship over now? Is there anything else I can do to try and restore peace? And how worried do I need to be for my friend?

**TL;DR**: Best friend's boyfriend trapped me in a room and was behaving concerningly. Lead to a fight with my boyfriend, and now my best friend isn't speaking to me. I'm sad and worried for her."
"I (31M) had a major appearance change and it has completely changed my relationship with my wife (27F). HELP!


Hello all--I'm a frequent contributor here on a non-throwaway, but as my wife and I both use and follow each other on reddit I made a toss account as I'm now the one in need of advice! 

**TLDR at the bottom.**

My wife and I have been married almost 7 years, together almost 10, for background.  It has been what I would say is a ""great"" marriage. No real problems besides the occasional disagreements we've handled amiably. Recently, though, we've been in a really tough spot. I think we are a candidate for couple's counseling, but we've never been and my wife is wary about its ability to help. The cause of all of this is the following:

We had our first child late last year.  I get paternity leave at my company, so I took off a few months and started back at work refreshed and moving into a big management promotion at the beginning of the year. I work in software and over the years my appearance and self-care has gotten a bit sloppy. I dressed in athletic clothes/lounge wear, didn't really put any effort into self care (no hair styling, no skin care routine, got lazy with shaving, etc.) and only worked out on rare occasion. My slovenly look had been a point of contention with my wife for some time (rightfully so, as when we first met I put a lot of effort in and was very fit) and with my new start at work/new dad life I committed to turning things around.  I lifted four days a week, I completely redid my wardrobe, grew a beard for the first time, got a consistent barber and haircare/skincare routine, etc. After a handful of months, I was like a brand new person.

Now I expected this to really lift our relationship (even higher, I guess, as we've had a great thing going) since it was at my wife's consistent (but kind) request that I ""put in some effort"" to my appearance.  However, quite surprisingly, it's been the opposite. When we go out, I'm getting a lot of female attention, with women hitting on my brazenly at the grocery store, restaurants, the gym, etc... Which has never happened to me before in my life. The kind of thing that normally happens to my wife (and we enjoy/laugh about). However, she is really not handling it well. She routinely tells me now that she ""misses the old me"", that she's ""tired of other women ruining our evenings every time we go out"" and has even said on a few occasions that she didn't care about how I looked because she loved me for who I was! It is even affecting our (until this change, intensely active) sex life as she claims she was more attracted to ""the old me"".  Anytime I try to talk to her about these issues it somehow turns back around on me or becomes part of a ""with your new look you now think everything is about you"" discussion. 

It's starting to affect my work life as well--I work for a start-up so I have a lot of young, single female coworkers.  At our summer company picnic a week ago they had a ""year in review"" fake rewards show, and I was given the ""Zaddy of the Year"" trophy as voted by the girls of the office.. My wife went to the bathroom in tears and I had to awkwardly run after her from the stage instead of enjoying a feel good, funny moment with my team (most of whom she knows and hangs out with all the time). Now she's possessive/hawkish around any of said coworkers at happy hours/nights out. If it was just a few convos at home, I could brush it off, but I feel like I'm going insane! I recommended to her we go to couple's counseling this week... but she's so far been pretty resistant.  She thinks that there ""isn't a point"" and that counseling isn't for ""small things"" like this, but I asked her to really consider it after expressing my concerns and she said she could try it.  Am I doing the right thing? Am I overreacting to all of this? Thanks for any advice.

**TL;DR:** I followed my wife's advice/request to ""up my game"" and improve my physical appearance. Now I'm getting a ton of female attention, and she's wishing I hadn't done it. Her feelings about it are affecting our relationship and my job. I think we should get couple's counseling, she's hesitant. Thoughts?"
"My husband (M43) can't understand why I (F38 and recovering alcoholic) don't want to hang out at a bar with our toddler


Throwaway account since he's on reddit. I've been a heavy drinker my whole life. The only time I was able to stay sober for any length of time was during my pregnancy. After I stopped breastfeeding the stress of being the bread-winner and a mother caused the drinking to kick in again and I've been ashamed of it ever since. Now that our daughter is almost two I'm making the decision to go sober permanently. My husband doesn't seem to grasp the difficulty of this. He was always a drinker too, but seemed to have no problem giving it up or going to light drinking whenever he wanted. Unlike him I have depression and a family history of alcoholism and abuse, so I guess my drinking is more of a coping mechanism than his.

The other night he wanted me to bring our two year old to a bar where his friends were hanging out. I didn't feel comfortable and tried to get out of it, but he kept insisting, saying I need to be more social, and he hasn't seen them in a while, and lot's of people bring their kids to this bar and stay out with them late, and he wanted to be a cool family that takes their kids out in the evenings. I explained that its not a good idea to take a recovering alcoholic to a bar, and anyway I don't like bringing her there so close to her bedtime. He acted like I was being totally antisocial and selfish and kept arguing about it. We agreed to take two cars there so I could leave with her early, and I didn't last long. Just everyone enjoying their drinks, and the thought that I might have drinks and drive home with her made me want to cry. I left after about an hour. He seemed super hurt and abandoned when I packed her up and left. He said ""Your leaving already? OK. I guess I'll just say hi to everyone for you.""

He's always been a bit of an enabler, telling me it was ok to have a drink after a week sober and so forth. I wish I could help him internalize how hard this is for me. It's like he doesn't even see how much I suffer in relation to the drinking compared to him. Sometimes its as though he doesn't even see me as a person who's struggling and needs support. I love him but I can't be a drunk mommy anymore. If I have to choose between him and my kid it's 100% my kid. I just wish it didn't have to be one or the other. Any advice or support is welcome.

"My (25F) boyfriend (28M) crushes me under his weight during sex


Throwaway for usual reasons ... This feels silly to post about, but frankly: my boyfriend of 1 year let's (what feels like) his whole weight on me when he is on top during sex and it completely removes me from the moment. We try to be super open about bedroom likes/dislikes so I have told him before that I can't breathe during those times, but it continues to happen. In the moment, I'll push up on his chest and it seems like he gets it cuz he'll lift himself up more, but it's usually never high enough and he'll often just go right back to putting his weight on me when in missionary. 

I guess I'm most worried that he's just incapable of having sex on top in a way that doesn't require him to leave so much weight on me, but he's a muscular and pretty fit guy.. like 6'1"" and 185 lb. His weight has fluctuated and it's a point of self-consciousness for him so I don't want to make him feel bad about it. It just feels like more and more of an issue bc with past men, I've loved being on bottom and when I'm on top with him, the sex tends to end pretty quickly, so it affects my entire perception of our sex life.

Is this something I can bring up directly again? And if so, is there a way I should word it so it doesn't seem like I'm bringing up his weight?

  
TLDR: During missionary, my boyfriend let's his body rest on me to the point where I can't breathe regularly, but I don't want to bring his weight/body type into the conversation about it. I need help with communicating how important this is to me."
"My (f27) husband (m26) insists on looking through my phone. This makes me uncomfortable.


TL;Dr should I let him snoop?

I have never cheated or even told white lies. Nonetheless he wants to look through my phone and messages and whatnot. This makes me uncomfortable for reasons I'm not quite sure why - maybe because he's previously become angry about minor things I wrote to my friends, or on Reddit.

 If I mention this to him (that it makes me feel uncomfortable), he becomes angry (like right now, where he just stormed out of the apartment). 

I'm not sure what to feel about the whole topic. Am I justified? Is he justified? Is his behaviour normal these days?"
"My [35F] sister [38F] lost her daughter [5F] one year ago and her marriage recently collapsed. She says she's driving around the country and I'm really scared for her.


3 months ago she divorced her husband after over a year of being unable to be together after their girl died of illness. They moved apart and now my sister lives on her own.

She took vacations from work 2 weeks ago and says she took off on her car and is just roaming around the state going to certain places and exploring other cities, and plans to go to other states.

At first she didn't say anything and replied to my texts normally but last weekend she told me she had been on the road for 5 days and doesn't plan to come back for at least another 2 weeks.

We spoke on the phone and I kinda freaked out when she told me was travelling on her own while heavily depressed. I asked her if she thought that was safe and she said she had a .38 and knew how to use it.

That was the part when I definitely freaked out and started crying and she started crying too when I asked her why she was doing this. She said she doesn't know but doesn't want to come back home just yet. She cried for a while and then said that she was fine and hung up.

I don't know what to do. She's safe as far as I can tell. She shares her location with me often over text and a locating app so i know where she is most of the time, but I'm still very worried for her.

I mean on one side I can't stop her from doing anything, but on the other it kinda kills me inside that she's so hurt and doing something so uncharacteristic all of the sudden with no warning.

Is there anything I can do? What should i do in the meantime? Talk to her normally? What should I do when she comes back?

**tl;dr:** Sister lost her girl to disease, her marriage crumbled and is driving around the state apparently aimlessly because she's depressed and doesn't want to be home. Is there anything I can do to help her?"
"My [F25] boyfriend [M32] wants to befriend other girls and blames me for his unhappiness


I moved to a new city about 1 year ago where I met my boyfriend. He was new in town too and we have pretty much spent all our free time together ever since we met.

I met him via a social meetup app and have throughout our relationship caught him a couple of times messaging other girls on the app, asking them to meet for coffee, drinks or sightseeing. He has always insisted that he just wanted to socialize so I let it go but made it clear that I wasn’t cool with him messaging other girls behind my back.

This morning he complained that he doesn’t have any friends in our city and blamed it all on me. He said my jealous behavior is the reason why he has hidden things from me in the past (messages and meet-ups) and that I should be cool with him making friends with other girls.

I never used to be a jealous person but he is always checking out other girls and commenting on them, and although he says he just does it to rile me up, it’s making me feel very insecure about myself. He knows this but still does it.

I don’t have a problem with him befriending other girls per se, but I just don’t think it’s appropriate for him to meet up with random girls from online sites on a one-to-one. That seems like a date, right? He thinks I’m being completely unreasonable and possessive and insists he would be cool with me meeting up with other guys as long as there’s no other intention than friendship.

Am I wrong for feeling the way I do?

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My boyfriend wants to meet up with other girls and wants me to be cool with it."
"My [21F] boyfriend [21M] is hanging out with a past summer fling late nights in his apartment, and suddenly stopped talking about her, don't know what to do or how to get him to understand why I'm upset.


 

I apologize for how long this is, but a lot of small things have led me to this point. This is a throwaway account Bc my boyfriend is on reddit. 

My boyfriend and I have been together almost two years now and the relationship has been great. We both go to college together but are long distance for the summer Bc he's staying at our university to take a summer class and I went back home for an internship. Right before summer started, he had told me that an old summer fling (I’m going to call her Amy) from last year was coming to our university to take a class there during the summer term as well (not the same class as him). 

Now some background on this fling: my boyfriend and Amy had met last summer while they were both working at the same internship in a different state where Amy lives. She doesn't go to our specific university, but a sister university. This fling had been before we started dating and he had told me that he hadn’t felt any emotional connection with her it was just a fun summer fling that he had enjoyed with her while in a different state. However he had also told me that she had been irrational with her feelings and told him that she loved him within a month of them sleeping together even though he had been clear with her from the beginning that this was just a short term fling and he hadn't felt anything for her. A lot of times, he had been worried that she was getting too attached during their summer together. 

Also, neither me nor my boyfriend are the jealous type and have quite a few friends of the opposite gender. I have never had an issue with him hanging out with girls in the past and I am even mutual friends with some of them. 

That's why, when he told me that Amy was going to be there for the summer I wasn’t worried. He had told me that she had messaged him that she was coming and he had told her right away that he had a girlfriend. He said that she responded with a sad face emoji and started telling him about the men she had slept with this past year. He had asked me if I minded if he showed Amy around the university or hung out with her sometimes Bc she didn’t have any friends or a car here. I told him I didn’t mind because I trusted him and didn’t think it would be a problem. 

However the very night that Amy landed she texted him and went to his apartment the first night. It was late at night past midnight. My boyfriend told me she was coming over and even FaceTimed me while they were together so I could meet her. They were drinking and he told me they talked all night. Even though he was upfront with me about it it made me uncomfortable that they were in his apartment together late at night drinking, which wasn't something I had initially expected when he said they were going to hang out, but I didn’t say anything because I thought I was just being jealous. 

However the next weekend past midnight she texted him again saying she was hungry and asked if he wanted to eat. She didn’t want to eat fast food which was all that was open so he invited her back to his place to make her food and they hung out again in his apartment late into the night. Again he told me about it as it was happening but I was starting to feel really uncomfortable and felt like even though it’s not “cheating” it was kind of disrespectful to our relationship. 

I talked to my friends about it who thought it was weird that they hang out at all Bc he had said in the past that there  hadn't really been a friendship there, it had just been sex, and my friends encouraged me to talk to him about it. 

I talked to him and he didn’t understand why it was wrong or disrespectful, but said he would stop if it was hurting me. He said that he was hanging out with her Bc she was lonely and he felt bad for her. This made me feel guilty and I let him know that I still didn’t really have an issue with him hanging out with her during the day in a more appropriate context and it was the late night in the apartment that I didn’t like. My bf said he respected my concerns and continued to always tell me when they were together and it was only during the day. 

However now I’m starting to feel touchy about the subject because I’m worried that  Amy is trying to win my boyfriend back because she had been “in love” with him and I remember the irrational feelings my boyfriend had told me about. I know this may sound jealous, but personally, if I had been in love with someone in the past and they had a girlfriend now, I wouldn't feel okay about spending late nights with them unless I had an ulterior motive. 

A week after my talk with my bf he texted me and asked if I wanted to visit this tourist attraction with him and Amy when I visited him for the weekend. I told him he could go with her but I didn't want to. Because I'm also touchy about the subject now, I think I sounded annoyed and told him I didn’t want to share the weekend with her when I barely got to see him but clearly that wasn’t the case for him. He couldn’t understand why I was upset Bc he had “been upfront about every time he hung out with her” and the fight ended with him just not going to the place with her. 

However, ever since he has not mentioned her at all and I find it hard to believe they suddenly stopped hanging out. I don't want to cause another fight or have him think I'm a crazy jealous girlfriend so I haven't asked about it. I just decided to trust him because I have no reason not to, and try to forget about it. 

However, when I came to visit him this weekend, he was on snapchat and I noticed that he had a streak with Amy. Normally, this wouldn't be weird, but my boyfriend doesn't really have streaks with other people. In fact, other than me, she is his only other streak. Even he and I only have streaks when we are long distance because we snap each other a lot. So now I'm wondering if they have a streak because they are snapping a lot as well. 

 I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to fight considering he had made this weekend so romantic and showered me with love and attention. However I am at my wits end. Am I crazy, or is this relationship inappropriate? How do I get him to understand? I feel like I messed up because at least before, he had been telling me about her, and I don’t want to keep sounding jealous. On top of everything, I like this situation even less because I definitely don't trust her intentions. 

I know once the summer ends she will go back to another state so the problem will end, but is this a red flag for the future of our relationship? 

In all other ways he is the perfect bf so I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: boyfriend has been hanging out with past summer fling late at night in his apartment, and can’t understand why it upsets me. He stopped telling me about his interactions with her after we fought about it and now idk what to do."
"Should I [30f] say something to a friend [27f] for being inappropriate with my bf [29m]


We’ve been dating for about 3 years. In the past year or so our friends have been merging with a new friend group. We’ve all hung out a good bit and everyone gets along pretty well.  Tara, we’ll call her, is one of these new friends. Recently she broke things off with her fiancé and is back on the dating scene. Also recently, at a big BBQ, Bf had brought some things and Tara owed him whatever small amount of money. She came up to him while we were mid conversation with some other friends and bf said “oh hey I have something for you” and handed her a bag. She coyly said “I got something for you!” And wiggles her ass in his face. Everyone there is immediately super silent and uncomfortable. She keeps wiggling “the money is in there.” Bf is eventually just like “I’m...not reaching in your pocket?” She then got kind of embarrassed and tried to pretend she had been telling me to get it. Which...no. 

Obviously my Bf is totally in the clear here, and later on we laughed about how bizarre it was. But also this girl is around often and is coming to my house soon for a big girl’s day type event. Should I let this be? Is it weird to tell her ahead of time “hey that was uncomfortable and inappropriate and try to respect some boundaries here” or should I just act like it never happened? I don’t want to start drama but I also don’t want to be a pushover.

TLDR; friend was inappropriate in public with my bf, should I say something?"
"How can I [31F] learn to be less passive-aggressive to my partner [29M]


Sadly, I'm writing as the partner who is passive-aggressive and emotionally manipulative. I've been reading about toxic relationships recently and have started to realize that I fit into a few of these categories with my partner of almost 4 years. It's been worse recently, and I can tell it's starting to affect him. I love him, and he deserves better. I know I'm on the older side for this site, but I figure better late than never.

Examples of this behavior: double speak; saying one thing and hoping he'll read between the lines to figure out the true meaning. Not saying what I want (for example, that I want him to send Sunday morning with me) and then getting upset (passive-aggressively) when I don't get it. Taking offhanded comments (""I like that other shirt better"") VERY personally. And I have to admit, I have to fight the urge to give the silent treatment very hard, as I have had it done to me, and it's awful. But the urge is there.

I've been better about catching myself over text for the past few weeks. For example, when I texted that he should see his friends instead of me on Friday and he agreed, my initial response was hurt and rage (although I didn't write anything). I then took a deep breath, realized that he thought my proposal was genuine (as it should have been), and then texted, genuinely: ""Have a great time and say hi!"" I know this sounds basic to most people, but I'm trying.

My bigger problem is in real life. I am a reactive person, and my face betrays everything. I want to learn to recognize my behavior in the moment and prevent it from being hurtful, and I'm not sure how to do that in real-time. At some point, I'd like not to do this at all. I appreciate any suggestions or tips that have been successful.

It's been a year full of stress and tragedies for both of us, and neither of our mental health conditions is amazing. I can tell my inconsistency (from caring and supportive to horrible and back) is starting to wear down what little self-esteem he has left, and I don't feel great about myself when I act this way, either. He is a good guy and deserves a more fair situation.

tl;dr: how to unlearn passive-aggressive and manipulative behavior to be a better partner."
