None of these comments are downvoted. Some have upward of 40 upvotes. I just wanted to alert people of this before the campaign gets underway and there's more and more r/RightWingLGBT and r/The_D garbage that makes their way here just like 2016 and 2018 to tell us that Trump and Republicans are pro-LGBT. 

They're not. They're hostile to LGBT folks and this is them in their natural habitat. Steven Crowder has been referring to a gay man as 'lispy queer' for weeks. And they all love him for it."
"Dear first world bros, please stop whining about companies cashing out on pride month, because they also have a significant political impact in 2nd and 3rd world countries


While I understand that most companies do it for money, please keep in mind that these international companies do have a political and social impact in some markets where it's not just a marketing scheme like in the US.

I'm really glad to see this Western, pro-LGBT media push in places like Romania (where I'm currently living) where no national company in its right mind would supports LGBT causes because of the backlash they might get. 

It's super validating for LGBT people in a country like this to see big ass companies like Coca Cola, Netflix or Microsoft have a stronger political impact than all of the pro-LGBT politicians in this country combined. Companies like this have more to lose than to win in the short term and it's really nice to see them go for it instead of just thinking about short term profits."

"I was called homophobic and it's still bothering me


 

I need to get this off my chest, and I think some folks within our community could bear to hear this. TL;DR at the bottom. 

The other day I was getting to know a new friend. He made a RPDR reference that went over my head and I told him I don’t watch the show. He called me a bad gay, we laughed, whatever. Later, we were talking about our interests and all of his revolved around the gay scene. Gay bars, gay clubs, gay sports teams, gay beaches, bath houses, etc. I told him that’s great, not what I normally do but it sounds fun. He asked me why I don’t participate in the gay scene much and I explained that I’m not all that tapped into gay culture and my interests primarily revolve around music, outdoors, and travel. He told me I have internalized homophobia for “separating myself from the gay community.” 

I do not separate myself from the gay community, it’s just not my primary interest. I celebrate being gay and I'm very open about it, but my gayness is not my entire identity. There’s a lot more to who I am than my sexuality, and my world does not revolve around being gay. I go to gay bars. I go to not-gay bars. I go to music festivals. I go to drag shows. I hike and kayak and build campfires. I play tennis and volleyball. I paint my fucking nails. 

I will NOT feel shame for who I am. I will not apologize for doing what makes me happy. I am no less gay because I don’t keep up with the Kardashians or go to circuit parties. I love myself, I’m comfortable with my identity, and I’m confident in who I am. I don’t need to validate my gayness to anyone. 

What I’m asking gay bros is this: please stop dividing and ranking our community. Being gay is not a competition. Allow people to participate in whatever activities and communities they feel fulfilled by. Stop tearing down others in our community because they don’t like the same things as you. Literally the whole mission of the LGBT+ community has been to strive for inclusion and acceptance. It seems that some of us have lost sight of that. Bear that in mind the next time you want to criticize others within this community. 

Happy Pride month, look out for each other.

TL;DR - Gay elitism is toxic. Stop calling everyone homophobic because they aren’t like you. Stop adhering everyone to your perception of what gay looks like. Support each other, celebrate each other, and love each other."

"Can we PLEASE stop complaining about “rainbow capitalism”?


I’ve noticed a new trend this year of people complaining about businesses openly supporting the LGBT community - mistakenly dwelling on the thought that businesses are profiting off of rainbow products. 

I’d like to remind you all of a time when our community was a laughing stock. A time when businesses actively worked against us. A time when the only thing Republicans and Democrats could agree on was that homosexuality was wrong. A time when openly supporting LGBT people was career suicide. A time when people were boycotting movie theaters that showed Brokeback Mountain. A time when people were pissed off that Rosie and Ellen were allowed to be on TV despite being openly gay. 

Last weekend, I walked around the mall and saw something incredible. I saw hundreds of people walking around with rainbow Steve Madden bags - many of whom I’d assume are not gay and would not openly voice their support for the LGBT community.

I also saw stores decked out in rainbow decorations and people didn’t seem to be bothered by it. 

*It was normal.*

For once, I felt accepted as part of society. I felt comfortable in my own skin as I walked around the mall. Not once did I give thought to how much money companies were generating off of a rainbow t-shirt (that likely is a tough sell to anyone who isn’t gay). Why? Because it didn’t matter. The support was what mattered to me - something I couldn’t have dreamed possible 15-20 years ago. 

To those who take issue with businesses generating revenue, I’d like to remind you how businesses operate in the United States. Most provide goods and services in exchange for revenue. The entire concept of entrepreneurship is to find a need and satisfy it.

When you are hot, electric companies profit off of your need for cool air. When you are hungry, restaurants profit off of your hunger. When you travel, airlines profit off of your need to get from point A to point B. Profit is part of operating and businesses need to generate a profit to continue to operate. 

Like it or hate it, that’s capitalism but know that this is not something exclusive to a company expressing support for a community.

My ask is for those who are complaining about “rainbow capitalism” to take a step back and try to see the big picture. Many of you, I assume, are young and have grown up in the current environment of acceptance. That’s okay but have a talk with some of the 30+ community members here and try to understand what the past was like for us and why companies openly supporting our community is a much bigger deal than just “They’re profiting off our struggles!”

15 years ago, a company would’ve gone under for supporting the LGBT community. Today, it’d be a devastating mistake not to. We’re progressing and, while we’ll always be different than straight people, we’re finally starting to be treated like people.

Let’s not fuck this up."

"I had a surprisingly nice experience at a gay bar that boosted my confidence


I went to a gay bar very briefly in this city I’m
visiting just to get a drink or two, and some guy in his late 20’s says to me at the end “hey are you alright mate? You look a bit fucked up” !!!!!. And I’m like 😧 err yea I just had a bit to drink and I’m tired. 

I took a slight bit of offence to his comment maybe I took it the wrong way but like when I was leaving he caught up to me and said Hey!! Are you okay? And im like I’m fine :) ... just tired. I’ll be on my way.  And he goes Hey! Can I just say. I think you’re beautiful. Are you married?

And I’m like no I’m 22 😇 And he’s like can I kiss you on the cheek? And I’m like Yeahhh alright then

Just sharing this as I’m someone that’s usually pretty shy + don’t have high self esteem / good image of myself (his original comment I took it as “yep I’m ugly”) but I just want to share to say that there are decent people out there and you *can* go to gay bars by yourself. This guy made me smile. :)  and boosted my confidence - maybe I’m not ugly at all - you probably aren’t either.

"I’m confused and had a situation recently present itself with my best friend and now I’m questioning my sexuality and I need advice/help on figuring out what to do.


Yes I made a new account for this. People know my actual account and I wanna keep this on the DL as much as possible until I figure out what to do. Any advice or help in this situation would be greatly appreciated. I’m telling the whole story so it will be long. No TLDR so just ignore it now if you don’t wanna read for a few minutes. Here we go

Up until last week I believed I was 100% straight. I’m 25 and I’ve had the same best friend since we were 12. In high school everyone thought he could be gay and would always ask me, which I always denied because I never thought he was. He had girlfriends through the years so that thought eventually left my memory. When I was 21 I started dating this girl and we were together over 4 years until 2 months ago when I came home to find her in my bed with someone else. I couldn’t get past it and we broke up and my best friend has been there for me ever since.

 About 2 weeks ago we were at a bar and I was being really depressing about the whole situation and I got really really drunk. He drove me home and I have the smallest memory of him putting me to bed then kissing me. When I woke up I didn’t remember until a few hours later and I called him and asked him about it and he just laughed and said I was super drunk and that never happened. I wanted to believe him, but I remembered it and knew I wasn’t crazy. The memory was foggy, but I knew it happened. I dropped it the next few days and just decided to move on like nothing happened. A few nights later him and some friends came over to watch baseball. We had some beers and eventually everyone left but him. I was drunk again and determined to get him to admit he kissed me. I brought it up again and said I know I’m not crazy and this happened.... this is where things start to unfold. He then straight up admitted he did it and he had wanted to do it since we were 14. I asked him if he was gay and he said yes and said he’s never been with a guy and never told anyone before. I told him I didn’t care about the kiss anymore and he needed to take this all in. I could tell he was flustered and this was a big moment for him. We just kinda sat for awhile and I told him I was here for him and whatever and whenever he wants to talk about it, we can. He was pretty quiet the whole time, I knew he was scared and embarrassed, until eventually he went home. He didn’t talk to me or answer my calls or texts for the next 3 days. I was worried but knew he needed the space. 

One night last week when I came home from work I saw his car outside my apartment (he has my spare key and I have his spare). I went inside and he was sitting on my couch. I asked if he was okay and he said no and wanted to talk. He was very fidgety and not really making any sense at first. Then he said he couldn’t be my friend anymore because he’s been in love with me for 10 years and now that I know his secret things can never be the same. I didn’t know what to do or say. I just kinda sat there silently. I didn’t wanna lose my best friend, the only person that’s been there for me through everything. I started to cry because I honestly didn’t know what else to do. I told him I didn’t want him to leave and wanted to talk but I needed a few minutes to get my thoughts together and chill out. I went to the bathroom and just kinda paced back and forth for a few minutes then I came back out and he immediately walked up to me and kissed me. When he stopped and stepped back I went back in and kissed him. I don’t know why, but in that moment it felt right. We made out for a few minutes until I finally stopped it and told him to leave. He didn’t say a word and just left. 

We didn’t talk for the rest of the week and I literally couldn’t think about anything else. Not that he was gay, or didn’t want to be friends, all I could think about was kissing him and how I want to do it again. I started questioning all my feelings and my sexuality. And how I’ve always gone to him or leaned on him for everything. Maybe I have had feelings for him this whole time and I was in denial? I really don’t know. I just don’t. I thought maybe I did what I thought I had to do to keep my best friend in my life. Was I lying to myself? Was I doing anything possible to not lose my girlfriend and best friend back to back? Was I using him as a rebound to get over my ex-girlfriend? It’s all so confusing and not making sense to me. So confusing that I even started watching gay porn, which I’ve never done before and I’m getting off to it. I like it. And it’s weird admitting that because this is all so new. I spent the next couple days questioning everything.

This past Saturday I called him and asked him to come over. He did and I was honest and told him everything. I told him I’m really confused and I don’t know anything anymore but the one thing I do know is I don’t want to lose him. He said he’s scared that I am doing this just to keep him in my life and that it’s only going to end up hurting him more in the end. 

The next part is hard for me to admit, but I want honest help and advice so I’m just gonna say it. He said he couldn’t do it anymore and wanted to leave. I’ve never pleaded anyone to stay before. Not even my dad when he left me and my mom. But I started pleading. I got on my knees and told him not to leave and started crying. Looking back it was like a scene from a movie. I grabbed his legs and held them and told him not to go. He begged me to let go and I finally did and he left. I ran outside and yelled that I loved him. I still can’t believe I said that. He just got in his car and left and didn’t even turn around to look at me. I was so sick to my stomach I called into work Sunday. I just spent the past 2 days going over the whole scenario in my head over and over again. Trying to change things and see where I went wrong. But it happened and I can’t take it back. 

He texted me last night and asked if I meant it when I screamed I love you. I told him I did love him, more than anyone in my life, but it’s not that kind of love. And that I was extremely sorry for everything that happened and I don’t want to lose him but I understand if he needs to cut me out of his life. I also apologized for doing all of this when he just came out and needs a friend right now more than this drama. We texted for an hour or so and eventually he came over to talk. The moment he walked in I just wanted to kiss him so I did. We kissed for a really long time then just laid on the couch in silence until he left. We never actually talked. 

I haven’t talked to him today but I’m scared. I think I’m more scared of the fact that I may actually be gay or bi and want to be with him. It’s all so new to me. I really think I like him more than a friend now. I honestly don’t think I’m just doing this trick him into staying in my life or using him as a rebound. He’s all I can think about now. And I’m thinking about him way more than just a friend. But I’m just so confused. And I’m really scared that I’ve hurt him which is not my intention. I don’t want him to think I’m leading him on, but I think he does think that. I know we need to talk about everything but I’m scared because I don’t know what to say or even how to start this conversation when I don’t even know what I’m truly feeling myself. 

What would you say to him if you were me? Do you think I’m being stupid? Am I literally setting up the only good relationship I have in my life to fail? I need any advice. Any tips on how to talk to him. Any suggestions on how to handle this in the future. I’m just so confused about everything and I really don’t know what to do. 

If you read the whole thing, thank you. And if you give any advice then thank you as well."

"Eid Mubarak

"My parents have basically said ""stop being gay and marry a girl or we won't see you again""


They more or less told me that they consider relationships with other men ""unnatural"" and said that if I don't find a girl and have a normal relationship with her then I won't get to talk to them or see them again. I'm not a teenager, I have my own place and a good job so I'm not dependent on them so it's not as bad as it could have been. 

My parents are Christian and care a lot about our wider (extremely conservative) family's views and their reputation which is why they're doing this in addition to any anti-gay feelings they might already have. But I don't know what to think. I have two adorable nieces that I'm really going to miss badly if I don't get to see them 🙁

Just talking to them has become toxic and ruins my mood and I don't know how things are going to play out.

Has anyone been through a similar experience?"
