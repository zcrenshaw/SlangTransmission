"Me (30m) and my gf (26f), for 8 years, just broke up, 2 kids (3&amp;5)


We ended it on pretty mutual terms. We just sorta grew apart into the point where we both werent happy and just looking for flaws in each other.

We agree on having the kids 50/50 and on being friends, which is something I actually believe will work.
She has a meeting tomorrow regarding getting an apartment pretty close to my house, where we all lived. Its pretty much the best setup for a shitty situation in my eyes.

The thing Im wondering is, how can I cope with the extreme loneliness Im feeling now? Its just like a wave of sadness that hit me once the kids was asleep this night. (Second night after the break, the first I spent with the kids together at my parents house).

If I struggle this much when I have the kids, how on earth would I survive when she has the kids for a week? (Agreed to one week each).

Im sure I will be more happy in the long run, then being miserable for years just for the kids. We've been miserable together for 6months at least when we decided to split. Im sure its for the best, so why am I not happy?

Tl dr; wondering how I will survive when my ex-gf has the kids for her week."
"I don't know how i should (32 f)eel after breaking up with bf (31 m).


Hi guys.
This is probably going to be a bit rambling because I'm struggling with how to get my thoughts together on being single again.

I split up with my boyfriend of over two years last week and I'm confused about my feelings.
First thing is that I was the one who initiated the breakup, although it ended up being pretty mutual because we both knew it had stopped working.

If I'm honest it hasn't been as hard as I expected and I haven't been a wreck like I have been with other breakups.

And that is part of what is confusing me.
I know it's probably not healthy but I feel like I want to just get right out there and meet other guys. When I was out with friends over the weekend I soooo wanted to just take a man home with me and I'm resisting the urge to get straight back on tinder.

The thing is I'm 32 and I kind of feel I should be past going wild after a break up.
Part of me thinks it would be good to be alone for a while, but another part of me wants to just have fun again and meet some new people.

I'm not quite sure what I'm asking, but I'd love to get your opinions.

Tldr: newly single and confused."
"BF (29M) left me (26F) last summer. A month later he regretted it and I took him back, but I am struggling with moving past the betrayal


My boyfriend, John (29M), and I (26F) started dating a little over a year ago. It was a whirlwind romance from the first date filled with romantic weekend getaways. 

We met each other’s friends after a month or two, and four months into it he told me that he loved me. I have always struggled with saying ”I love you” in past relationships, but with John it was as easy as breathing, because I knew it was true. 

I won’t go into too much details of it, but John suddenly ended things with me in the beginning of last summer after receiving news of a family emergency. He decided to move back home immediately (17+ hours away by plane) and decided he did not want to have a long distance relationship with me. Although this is a fair reason, he unfortunately handled the breakup in the worst imaginable way (over text when I was at work) and said some very hurtful things. He later said he was just doing it for my sake so that I would move on quicker, that me hating him would make me move on faster... Well, it wasn’t a great strategy. Even to this day, I still feel the pain from the breakup and all the things that were said.

A month later, in the end of June last year, he came crawling back asking for forgiveness. He flew back to see me in the beginning of August and by the end of August, after many many long talks and him asking for forgiveness, I finally decided to take him back. It might sound crazy, but I did want him back. He was and still is the love of my life. Apart from the breakup, he treated me in the best imaginable way and is a great guy. For the Friends fans out there, I think he’s my ’lobster’.

You would think that we lived happy ever after, right? Well, although I’m very happy with John, I still carry the emotional scars from how awfully he handled the breakup. Next week we are moving in together but I still struggle with feelings of hurt over what happened and fear that he will do it again. 

So I am just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to finally get over it? My boyfriend has grown tired of hearing me expressing that I have these feelings and says he feels that I am punishing him for life over the breakup by bringing it up once a month or so. So how do I stop it from reappering every now and then?

**TL;DR Boyfriend (29M) of a little more than a year ended things with me (26F) for a month last summer. The breakup was very painful for me, but he came back asking for forgiveness and we have been going strong ever since. Next week we are moving in together, but I can’t forget about him leaving me once before. How to move on?**

"Every girl ignores me [20M] and I'm getting very depressed


I'm in college and I'm kind of trying to get a girlfriend. I'm pretty shy  and I'm just trying to talk to girls, but by the way they react to me you'd think i'm some kind of monster. I talk to them in class and they'll talk back, but if I try to message them asking normal stuff people ask each other, they always ignore me like I'm just garbage or something. There is nothing wrong with me and there's literally no reason for them to be so fucking rude. I'm getting so annoyed and I can't understand why they won't respond to a normal txt message

tl;dr: girls ignore me"
"My [36m] wife [29f] snapped last night. How can I show understanding and compassion when speaking to her tonight?


My wife I believe has been going through some real bad emotional changes here lately. She is 30 weeks pregnant with our triplets and we have a 1.5 year old as well. She is a wonder woman and I love her so much. We hired a part time housekeeper to assist her with housework, as it's getting hard for her to do a lot physically. Shes been having quite a few mood swings, but what happened last night really shocked me. 

I was a little late from work due to some unexpected things that happened at the end of my shift (only about 15 minutes over), when I tried to call her it was going straight to voicemail. That usually never happens as she always has her phone on her, so I was becoming a little worried. When I arrived home, I found her on the ground crying. She said that she had tripped after trying to bring up our son's diaper pail back upstairs. If I would have arrived when I was suppose to she wouldn't have had to do that. Then it went into a whole discussion about how I'm never there and I'm probably off cheating with another woman?? She was red in the face hysterical about this, all while I'm trying my best to calm her down. I go to help her up and she slaps me, yelling ""Don't touch me or MY child!"", takes our son and slams the door shut. 

This morning she barely would look at me,  and now I'm at work still in shock almost. I know that I'm not there, but I have to work. I think the childcare and pregnancy is starting to take a toll on her, and she just snapped. Maybe I want to try to be as understanding as I can when I talk to her later on tonight

**tl;dr** : Wife is 30 weeks pregnant with triplets and I think the stress is getting to her. She went off on me last night and I don't know how to talk to her reasonably tonight?"
"I [F21]am a member of an all-female club on my college campus. One of our members [19] came out as gender non-binary, and is now creating a social justice call-out culture within the group.


Don’t know if this is the right subreddit for this, but the girls in this club are like my family here at school. One of our younger members who has always been bright, energetic and passionate has lately become increasingly involved with social justice (or “PC”) movements and has discovered that they are non-binary, identifying as a “femme.” This is so fine with me, and all of us. We love them and just want them to be happy, and in theory their gender shouldn’t change a thing.

However, they are also in an executive position within the group, meaning they have a greater platform to speak/address all of the women as a whole than the average member would. Lately this has been being used to publicly call people out for using “incorrect” language, more often than not interrupting them to do so. Obviously this is really embarrassing for all of us, who are trying our best and have up until this point been free to express ourselves without the risk of offending anyone at meetings. The most common examples would be saying things like “hey ladies” or “hey guys,” playfully calling each other “bitches” or commenting at all on one another’s bodies (because it is “objectifying”). We are all college-aged females and this stuff is really, really hard to shake, especially coming from a place of friendship and intimacy.

There have also been more out-there incidents, such as saying we shouldn’t sing “ya” instead of “you” (despite the fact that that’s how it’s written in the song; we’re a performance group) because it “appropriates black culture” (they are not black). As a “ya”-saying southerner, this actually really annoys me, and also seems oddly offensive. Additionally, last night, the executive in charge of music jokingly instructed us to “sing like you’re fat”, meaning support your breath, and she was promptly put in her place (“YOU SHOULDN’T SAY THAT.” They are not fat.) The music director herself is fat and was not using “fat” as an insulting or demeaning term, she just wanted everyone to sing from their fat souls. Again, oddly offensive and out of line.

This is all starting to wear down group morale and is also, sadly, beginning to mean that every correction our friend makes is met with an eye roll instead of thoughtful consideration. It is honestly really hard to tell if they want to help us be more inclusive or are using this as an outlet to exercise their new identity by putting themselves on a pedestal and talking down to all of us. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt but either way, it is becoming toxic and needs to stop. However, none of us have any idea how to approach this without seeming anti-SJ. We want the group to be a safe space for everyone, but the calling-out and shaming is forcing everyone to sacrifice their comfort and ability to speak freely in order to make it a safe space for them.

TL;DR: A member of our all-female club has come out as non-binary femme. They are also passionate about social justice, and are beginning to interrupt group productivity to call out very minor instances of un-PC language. We are all tired of walking on eggshells, but don’t know how to broach the subject without coming off like queerphobic bigots. We love them and want them to be happy, but something needs to change."
"My wife (26) had an emotional affair, help?


Where do I start? I’m devastated, emotionally distraught, confused, humiliated, mad, debilitated, I could write a thousand adjectives here to describe how I’m feeling and not one would be able to describe my true feelings.

We got married almost 2 months ago, yes, you read that correctly, 2 months ago. We have been together for almost 3 years. I caught her in the act by complete coincidence, she had been out with me and a couple of friends, I came home early due to working the entire day and being exhausted. She hadn’t talked to me in hours and I texted her with no reply, so I texted our friends and asked her if she was ok and they sent a picture back of her on the phone and that they were coming home soon! It was almost 3AM. She had been buried in her phone and drinking all night, so I just thought, this is odd, because it’s 3AM, who could she be possibly talking to? I asked her about it when she got home, she lied of course and said it was friend and for the 1st time in our relationship, I said “prove it” and made her show me her phone. Of course, it was another man. My wife and I work at the same facility (in different areas) and she had talked about meeting this guy about a month prior and talked about how he was good at his job. I left and came back to talk the next day. 


She lied for the first few days, lied about it, tried to play it off like they were “just friends,” eventually the truth had to come out, because I asked to see phone records and everything else. They had been texting/messaging non-stop, mostly just “talk,” but plenty of inappropriate messaging, flirting, you name it. To be honest, our relationship was picture perfect. We communicated our feelings and thoughts frequently, our sex life has NEVER been better (we were actually planning on starting to try to have kids), we spent quality/frequent time together. Her father passed away, although they were not close, it hurt her immensely. She was distraught, but that happened more than 6 months ago. There was a situation that transpired at work that brought those memories back up and this man came in at a vulnerable time in her life and took advantage. It doesnt condone her actions, but that is her scapegoat. She has had a pretty fucked up childhood with abandonment issues and other problems, but I’ve never given her any shadow of any doubt that I was leaving. I have always been honest, loving and caring. 

As the last week has transpired, more information has continued to come out. More truths, but only because I’ve pried and pried to get it out. It is devastating, but I didn’t have the affair, so I want to at least know what the hell happened. The night that I found out, she was begging for him to call her and talk to her, she did this AS SOON AS I left. Of course, she tells me she “doesnt Remember” much of it and that “he didn’t mean anything to me.” Which, i know is bullshit. 


I don’t know what to do. I’m 24, financially stable in a high income job, I’m physically fit, fairly good-looking and dependent. The guy she had the emotional affair with is a raging alcoholic, has a severe criminal record, was notorious for beating his ex-gfs and wives, 12 years older than her and honestly a lunatic. This wouldn’t be the first marriage he has wrecked. She didn’t know any of that when talking to him of course. I love her more than I’ve ever loved another human, but she continues to lie and deceive me. Nothing was ever physical, as far as I know and she suggested marriage counseling and therapy for herself. I want to believe this will never happen again, but I don’t want it to happen when it’s too late.


She did this 1 month into our marriage. 1 month. We had just gotten back from our honeymoon, for fucks sake, we hadn’t even got our wedding pictures back! The affair went on for a month. She has since blocked him on social media, blocked his number and quit communicating with him all together, including work (they now work different shifts, shouldn’t be an issue). 

I want to help her if she has a legitimate problem. Personally, I think she’s addicted to attention. Somebody showed interest in her feelings, somebody showed interest in the way she looked and she fed off of it. I’m emotionally destroyed and confused on what to do. She wanted the certainty of me, but the thrill of him. 


She broke her vows to me, but I won’t break mine and I’ll at least try. 


I’m not irrational, I’ve been in long-term relationships where communication has lacked significantly. This is not one of them. I really don’t have a genuine reason for her to do this at all, especially at a high point in our relationship all together. 


tl;dr: my wife had an emotional affair less than month into our marriage. Still continues to lie about it. Suggested help for herself and our marriage. Really nothing prompting this. Don’t know if I should try or just cut my losses. Don’t know if she’s being genuine. Don’t know if she has mental issues precipitating this. "
"Too insecure for relationships?


I need some advice. I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2 years. We had no problems in the first year but in the last few months, my insecurities have been driving him away. I constantly need to ask him for reassurance about my appearance and how he feels about me. 
I have a history of eating disorders and though I am now recovered, I still have poor self esteem. My boyfriend has been amazing and supportive but he said recently that he is drained because of me pushing him away all the time. We used to have so much fun together but now I often ruin it by forensically analysing everything he says and asking him lots of stupid questions for reassurance. 

I get extremely jealous of his female friends, girls he works with etc. I worry he sees other attractive women and fantasies about having sex with them. A few months ago, I also asked him if he would not watch porn anymore as the thought of that made me jealous. He stopped and said he didn’t mind as he wasn’t that into it anyway. One time he mentioned that a female celebrity was attractive and I gave him the silent treatment for 2 days. He told me that there will always be other attractive women but he never thinks about others in a sexual/lustful way and that he only fantasises about me. But I don’t believe him as I know what all men are like. He is very honest and trustworthy, he’s given me no reason to think I can’t trust him. And he tells me I am stunningly beautiful. Recently he said, he no longer wants to go on holiday with me because I always pick fights and go silent on him for days.

He said that although he loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me, I either need to make an effort to sort myself out or it would be better for both of us to part ways. He tells me I’m the one who is “out of his league” but I think he is perfect and that he deserves someone perfect too. I wonder if I would be better off on my own as then I wouldn’t need to be jealous all the time. But he is the love of my life and I would regret losing him over my insecurities. I don’t know what to do to fix my low self esteem. I’ve had therapy in the past but I still suffer with my issues now. I wonder if I will always be too insecure for a relationship. 

Tl;dr low self esteem and jealousy over other women ruining my relationship with great boyfriend. Can it be fixed?"
"I (24M) am planning to break up with my emotionally unstable girlfriend (24F) but really unsure about the best time to tell her?


Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

To provide some context, I am currently in the UK and she is Chinese. We've been together for nearly 1 year now but started living together quite early on about 2 months in because her student accommodation contract finished. She was looking for a job here in the UK after graduation so that she could continue staying in the UK on a work visa but a couple of weeks ago we received news from the place she was interning at that they wouldn't be offering her a full-time job. It was too late to secure anything else before her student visa expired so we gave up on the job front and she flew back to China yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have had some great times together over the course of the relationship but for a variety of reasons I believe this is the best time to break up and move on with our separate lives - primarily differences in what we want from life in the future (kids vs no kids, necessity of buying house before marriage), a slightly shaky family situation on her end that I'm not sure I can deal with, the total inability of our families to communicate as we don't know Chinese and they don't know English, and finally our temperaments being incompatible long term. All of these are things I believe we could have perhaps kept working on gradually and found a way to make things work if she managed to get a job and stay here, but now with the long-distance aspect added to the mix I think it's a bridge too far. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally I would've liked to tell this to her face-to-face before she returned to China but I decided against this as she can get very emotionally unstable at times. As an example, when we got the news that the internship wouldn't be extended to a full time job she very seriously threatened things such as killing herself, killing me and then suiciding so that ""we could be together forever"" and other crazy thoughts. I even had to stop her from choking herself when I'd stepped out of the room for a bit and came back later. She mentioned that she's attempted suicide in the past before I met her so I am very wary of classifying this as an overreaction. In addition to this, she had not been back to her home for almost 2 years and she doesn't really know anyone else here in the UK as all friends from the UK university she was studying at left town after graduation. Hence I thought that if I at least wait until she gets back to China to tell her I'm looking to break up, she will have her family and friends there for support and to look after her. Plus I did not want to ruin the memories of her last few days in the UK, particularly as we were living together and she had nowhere else to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that she is back in China, I'm not sure what the best time would be for telling her about breaking up - whether I should do it as soon as possible or wait for a week or so once she is settled back home. **I don't mind her wanting to cut off all contact with me and thinking I'm a bastard, my main concern with the timing is to ensure she doesn't end up doing anything crazy and try to hurt/kill herself.** Unfortunately I don't have the option of contacting her friends/family to give them a heads up as I don't have their contact details and they can't speak English anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

My gut feeling is to do it immediately as I think this would be fair to her too, but I'm concerned if I do it so quickly and suddenly when she's back home after 2 whole years she'd get really overwhelmed emotionally. On the other hand if I were to tell her after a week or two, I'd have to spend the time until then deceiving her about still wanting to be together and going to visit her soon which seems like an asshole-ish thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - looking to break up with emotionally unstable girlfriend after she's gone back to her home country permanently and unsure whether it'd be better to tell her immediately or wait for a bit once she's settled down but continue being untruthful to her in the meantime."
"Was told my (28f) constant need for sex has turned my bf (27m) completely off.


Quick background. Dating for a little over a year. Have been living together for 8 months. (Yes we moved very fast)

September 2018 is when the major decline in our sex life happened. He lost his job. Became depressed. Couldn’t find work for awhile. So, I tried not to pester so much about sex. Because from past experiences I understand depression will impact his sex drive. 

Though, he is well aware of my high libido. He made attempts at sex. But it was mostly him star fishing. At this point. You take what you get. When you’re hungry, you eat. 

There really isn’t much affection and intimacy in our relationship. I don’t need for that as much as I do for sex. I like to cuddle and touch. But, that is not needed for me to be happy. However, I can recognize now that I am becoming resentful because of the lack of attention my body gets. 

So, after months of being miserable and just kinda keeping how big of a deal of it is to me. I decided to sit him down and ask him what the deal was. 

Long story short. I was told that my constant desire to have sex has become such a turn off for him. The fact that I could literally have sex anywhere anytime and that I constantly talk to  him about it has impacted him in a way that he no longer desires to touch me. 

I’m not sure how to feel. Angry, sad, used? I don’t know. I just feel like he’s using sex as a weapon I don’t feel like this is healthy. I truly don’t know how to compromise. Just stop talking about. Never mention it, and I might get fucked? 


TL;DR- bf (27m) told me (28f) that my constant desire for sex had made him not want to have sex. "
"When someone shows you who they are believe them...


 UPDATE to a previous post...see below. 

Today I’m home with our daughter who is sick and I find a two factor  protected email address on my computer. Ask husband about it...he gives me password. Curious so I look around. Find 2 sent messages to women on Craig’s List from 2017. I ask him about it and he claims it was (again) a poor decision after drinking? So...I spent the rest of the day digging and turns out he has set up profiles on Match, Plenty of Fish and Adult Friend Finder from as recent as 9/2018. From what I can tell there hasn’t been any messages or contact exchanges on these websites but wtf? Confronted him and (again) he says poor decision. But no follow through to cheat? I don’t believe a word that comes out of his mouth. And am constantly waiting for another bomb to drop. It’s no way to live and I should have believed all the signs about his character before now.  So listen when your inner voice speaks. 

ORIGINAL POST: Married (late 30'sF) whose husband (late 30'sM) ""forgot"" he was married on a business trip two years ago...aka he visited a massage parlor and received oral sex. He claims it was after a night of heavy drinking, but somehow he was ""with it"" enough to get cash out and pay for a taxi there so the Uber receipts wouldn't show up...Pretty cohesive thinking to me? At the time we had a 4 year old and a 9 month old, I was breastfeeding, had started a new job when my baby was 11 weeks old and I'm pretty sure was I was suffering from postpartum depression. My life was in total upheaval on so many levels that I didn't know what to do...so I did nothing. Sure I cried and screamed, but there were no real consequences. He agreed to counseling which we did for a few months with little success. To my knowledge there have been no other ""visits."" But there have been small lies about other things. We are still together, but I cannot trust him and feel like the romantic aspect of marriage is irrevocably broken. It's been a tough two years and I've found out other things he's done or lied about. Like when my grandmother passed away, he asked my boss to tell me so he could continue with a lunch ""date"" with his boss. My boss of course said ""no"" and he told me himself, but the fact he would do that is something that enters my mind almost daily. To make it worse the day my grandmother died, I was leaving a fertility appointment (had just gotten an IUI) and he tells me over the phone. Yes, I went to the fertility appointment alone too.

I'm struggling with feeling unloved and coupled with the mistrust I feel for him, our marriage pretty much sucks. He loves his children and says that he loves me, but I can't seem to forgive and forget everything. I don't want to break up my family and have my children grow up in two households, but I don't know how to get ""past"" the past and move to have some sense of happiness.

**TL;DR; : Married (late30sF) doesn't trust husband; believe it when people show their true character "
"Ex (21M) left me (20F) so he could stay close to his ex


My ex and I were together 7 months and had a really intense start - we had a very spiritual experience together and felt like we were the ones for each other and would be together forever. We were just instantly completely comfortable around each other. He was my dream guy - he was a talented musician with long hair and to me he seemed free and I loved that about him, I didn't want to be with someone who was concerned about societal standards.  

Before we got together, we spoke and met up as friends for several weeks. He would speak a lot about his close friend, I'll call her Kate, and even came into my workplace with her to speak to me and to introduce us both. I almost didnt pursue anything with him because I felt so strongly that he either had feelings for Kate or they were already together since he spoke so highly of her.

Soon after we got together, he told me that she was his ex girlfriend when they were young, and that they tried again since but didn't work out. He said that she was his soulmate. He would also text her a lot when I was with him and when she said she was dating a guy, he even told me that we should all go out for a drink together because he wanted to meet the guy she was dating to suss him out and ""look after her"". He also told me that they had a parallel trip when they were on acid together and believed they had a strong bond because of that.

I was obviously very upset by this all, and I spoke to him. He tried to take it all back and told me he had no feelings for her and that he was just excited by the trip they had together and that I should trust him. I said that I felt like she should give me and him space to grow as a couple.

However, we moved to a different city together and Kate kept popping back up in some way. For example, his family came to visit him and said they were bringing her. He also went home and saw her and never told me about it. I have no idea what they were saying to each other in between, but she also kept reaching out to him for emotional support.

At this point,  I was completely uncomfortable with all of this. I couldn't be myself around him or open up to him spiritually at all. We are both musicians (he studies it) and I couldn't sing or play in front of him anymore, I lost all of my confidence and felt like I'd never match up. He's known her since primary school and she helped him through a lot, and he had told me that because I had become closed off to him he didn't feel like he could open up to me about his problems despite me always assuring him that I was there for him through anything.  

I never said that I was uncomfortable with her being in his life,  I actually said I'd meet her but that meeting fell through. I was just very upset and he said that I was so upset that he felt like he was in an ultimatum situation. He stopped contact with her entirely and this lasted for about a month.

Admittedly I'd become very depressed due to all of this and the news that my father is gravely ill. I got this news this Christmas just gone and told him hoping for support. By this point we were arguing all the time, every time I tried to talk to him he would react with anger and would scream and swear at me and wouldn't stop even when I cried.

About a week ago, he messaged me saying that he's going to come and see me and if we didn't resolve anything that we would be over. He basically gave me the ultimatum that he needed his ex in his life because he can ""open up to her about his problems and not me"". He also said that he has no one to speak to about our relationship problems and that he would be speaking to her about these, which would put me in a very vulnerable position. 

I was distraught but I told him that I would overcome my feelings about this situation in order to see him happy. I told him that he should consider the fact that my father is very ill and putting me in such a vulnerable position is unfair, but I would gain the strength to go through it for him.

Despite this, I broke down completely and had to leave to go back home and see my mum. I felt like he had chosen her over me again and this time I couldn't take the pain.

It was his birthday on Friday, and he bluntly messaged me the night before to say that Kate would be going to his house on his birthday but I hadn't been invited myself- only to see his friends in the night.

We mutually ended it the day before his 21st birthday. He didn't seem upset at all, and said that I wasn't adding anything positive to his life and she was, yet I somehow ended up feeling guilty and that I hadn't done enough.

Despite everything, he could be very loving and used to cuddle me to sleep, cook for me and seemed to really love me and we had such a strong spiritual connection at the start.

Please, someone uninvolved who doesn't know him, was I right to leave this here even though I believed he was the love of my life? I'm heartbroken.

tl;dr - ex said his ex was his soul mate, left me so she could stay in his life because I was uncomfortable with how close they were."
"My boyfriend does not provide me with emotional support. Could we ever survive?


TL;DR: My boyfriend of two years never knows the right thing to say to make me feel better. I am always there for him and I provide him with all the emotional support her needs, but when it is my turn, those conversations barely last a minute because he does not know what to say. 

I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for almost 2 years now. I'll try to keep this short and only highlight the important points. For reasons I'd rather not get into, I have been living alone, 10,000+ km from any immediate family, for the last 10 years. Of course it has been rough, but in my own twisted way, I have discovered how to be okay with it. I speak with my  mum 3-4 times a week and occasionally text my two little brothers. Financially, I have been on my own since I turned 18. My now estranged father decided that since I had chosen to live my life in a different way that he chose, I should be responsible for my finances. Although all those experiences made me grow up quicker than I would have liked, I have learned to be okay with this. Do I dream of the day I will be reunited with my family? Yes. But I have somewhat accepted that there is nothing I can do about this right now. 

My boyfriend had a very different upbringing from me. His parents raised him to be so ignorant about what goes on in the world. For example, he didn't get an international passport until 23 and didn't try Chinese food until 22. He also never had to worry about having something to it or having any bills paid. His parents are not rich; they just found a way to take advantage of the system and live in subsidized housing forever. I was the first person my SO befriended that was not from his world. As a result, it has been an up hill battle getting my SO to understand the complexities of life, but the again, that's a story for another day. When he complains about family, life, money and school, I am always there. I listen, offer suggestions, give him a shoulder to cry on. 

I am currently going through the toughest phase of my life. I quit my job two years ago to go to grad school. I graduated in December after racking up over $35000 in debt. I have been unable to find a job since graduating. It has only been a month, which is normal, however, I cannot afford to live for another month like this. I have no income. I have taken out cash from my credit cards 4 times in the last 4 months (thankfully, I had great credit before school). In addition to my issues, my family is having trouble back home. There are 5 of them there and no one is working. My father got laid off last year and hasn't been interested in finding another job. My brother has been on the job market for almost 2 years and has not found anything; those are normal struggles back home. My mother has been a stay at home mum since I was born. She is trying her best to get a job but as you can imagine, it is not easy. The point is I have no help whatsoever and will probably be homeless by the end of March (I gave by 2 month notice because I knew for a fact that I could not afford March's rent). I cannot move in with my SO. He lives with his parents and they hate me (another long story but I will never be good enough because I am not religious). 

Anyway, I open up to my boyfriend tonight and just cry and break down. He can barely make up 3 sentences before he goes silent. This is after I stayed up until 3am this morning discussing his issues with him. He claims he just doesn't know what to say. I'll admit that his upbringing has caused him to fall behind in a lot of communication skills, but I want more than that. It is not the first time it has happened and it will not be the last. It is just the first time I am considering that I will need more than that from my SO. 

Maybe this is just a rant and thanks for reading. I am just so lost right now and the one person I can turn to in all of 11000km has no words.

"Women: do you have stronger legs than your husband?


F early 40s. Tiny upper body, skinny arms, flat chest and normal waist but pear shaped with a big backside and legs. Husband is a tall and lanky. We had a family Indian leg wrestling tournament and it’s fair to say I owned him :-) . He was partly shocked and partly defensive. He wanted to try it a different way so we then held both legs up in the air, pressed the soles of our feet together and pushed (like leg pressing each other) and I catapulted him across the room. He wanted to try it again and it was the same result. He laughed nervously but I could tell he was embarrassed. Ive known his cardio was better than mine for a while but whilst he is taller I’ve also known 100% that I have significantly stronger legs/glutes based on genetics, body type and our respective sports. 

TD;LR does this make me a little butch or are other women stronger than their there SO particularly in the lower body? "
"I [M21] have a good friend [M22] who seems very depressed. I’m starting to feel resentful towards him because I don’t want to fall back into my own depression. I know that is somewhat selfish, but would like to help him out.


One of my best friends who is also my roommate seems to be very depressed, I have recently come out of an episode of depression myself, and he’s exhibiting a lot of the symptoms I experienced. He doesn’t leave our apartment much, is often upset about something that happened each day, doesn’t eat much, is sleep deprived, and just generally looks really down/sad.

I’m starting to feel resentful towards him, because I don’t want to fall back into depression myself, as I have struggled with it in the past, and I spend a lot of time with him. I have heard that depression can be “contagious”, so I have been pulling myself away somewhat recently. 

I don’t want to feel resentful towards him and really want to help him feel better, he is financially restricted so I don’t know how feasible it would be for him to go to a therapist. He doesn’t really talk about how he feels much so it’s hard to know what’s really going on and to start a conversation about how I could help. Does anyone have tips/advice for getting through to him/decreasing my resentful feelings/helping him out in general. Advice on how to start the conversation would be great too. Thanks!

TLDR 

My roommate seems to be very depressed and I’m growing resentful out of fear of falling back into my own depression. It’s hard to get through to him on emotional type stuff and I’m looking for advice on how to help him."
"I(21F) want to break up with my boyfriend(23M) but I’m so unsure of how to do it I’m having anxiety attacks


TL;DR I want to break up with my boyfriend without listing a bunch of trivial-sounding reasons at him or hurting him but still don’t want to be too vague about it because I feel he deserves better than that.


I want to start off by saying my boyfriend is a really sweet person overall and it’s making this EXTREMELY harder than it should be. 


We’ve been together about 6 months and while I have a “list” of reasons I want to breakup, none of them are individually huge red flags or anything so I have no idea how to go about this?


- I feel like our relationship has moved way too fast for 6 months and I’m uncomfortable. I told him and while he expressed concern he still expects the same behavior from me/same frequency in seeing each other. He talks about us getting married/our future kids/living together in the future as if I’ve already discussed and agreed on these things with him.


- our political views are pretty different to the point where I feel uneasy ever discussing them and don’t like thinking about how he feels about certain political scenarios. 


- I don’t think he has a SERIOUS problem but he can’t really go a day without either drinking, smoking weed, taking kratum etc or a combination. I don’t like to do things like that every day and being sober while he’s in some kind of high every day makes me uncomfortable. I’ve brought this up to him and he just gets defensive and says I’m overreacting and that he clearly doesn’t have a problem so I shouldn’t worry.


- (sorry for being blunt) I have a hard time always getting wet enough during sex, especially after starting the birth control I’m currently on, and he kind of... doesn’t realize or pushes through. I have bled a few times from lack of lubrication and I’ve brought it up and he just kind of apologizes but then never changes his behavior.


But overall he is respectful and kind and I want to break up with him as easy as possible. I’m worried that all of these reasons would come across wrong like “ur bad at sex lol” or that TECHNICALLY I’ve already tried to bring up these issues with him and he might get defensive and say he’s already working on them/heard it already so what more can he do.

"I [22M] have lost a friend [19F]


So this person (we'll call them B) I know when I met them was a very nice and down to earth kind of girl, someone who I thought was in a good place. But I don't think I could have been more wrong after knowing them for a longer period of time. They from their past history have a severe case of depression and mental illness. 

They would often lie and manipulate people to get them to either sympathise with her or get them to do B a favour. One example is they made up a complete back story about having a sibling who passed away in their childhood due to suicide. She went as far as photoshopping herself on past pictures to fake this. Additionally having a ""death day"" where she bought flowers to mourn for her loss. By doing this B got given money by people she knows.

This is just one of many many questionable and morally repugnant things B has done in order to benefit herself. I, whilst trying to understand couldn't take it anymore. I told her that her behaviour couldn't continue otherwise she would lose her remaining friends. 

She would later block me from everything to cut me from her life after this. I'm trying to just justify any of her actions but can't seem to do so. I guess what I can come up with is her mental illness, but it has been extremely hard for this to be just it. B uses her condition sparingly whenever it best suits her. For example she would often pull out last minute in social events and claim it was due to depression. However on numerous occasions she would end up going with different people or to a different place. 

I have tried to speak to her after confronting her but I don't think she will be willing to listen. I think I have to just take the loss on this one as she is not willing to listen or even talk it through with me. 

Anything I can do? Or should I just leave it at that?

tl;dr Confronted friend about behavior and was cut off. "
"Recently engaged. Fiancé (28m) has always wanted kids, I (24f) don’t. My mum (51f) said I’m selfish, I’m feeling really bad.


Throwaway.

My fiancé and I have been together for nearly a decade, he has always said he wanted children and I have always said I don’t. He proposed and I said yes of course, we are still as perfect as we always were and love each other dearly but I’m feeling really awful knowing he’ll probably not get children.

I brought it up with him and he said he thought about it before proposing, and if I don’t want kids he’s okay with it because he doesn’t want to ask me to do something he knows I don’t want. 

Tbh I think he thinks a little part of me does wants kids and I might change my mind, but I won’t. He often talks about what our children would be like,  for example, today he said “our children would be such nerds” and laughed (we’re quite geeky).

I feel really awful and I’m really afraid he might resent me in the future. I met with my mum today and she said it’s selfish of me to not do what my fiancé wants. She also wants grandchildren.

I don’t know what to do - do you think it’s selfish? Anyone experienced this? I’d love some honest advice please.

Thanks for reading 

TL;DR fiancé wants kids. I don’t. He said he’s okay with it, mum said I’m selfish and I feel bad.

"I [27F] don’t like my “best” friend [26F] and don’t know what to do about it


This is a really tricky one for me, will try to explain it properly and would really like some advice. 

I have an old friend, let’s call her Claire, and we’ve been friends since we were 5. More than that, we were best friends all through school - we had other friends too but we came in a pair, shared everything with each other, had the same interests and were really supportive of each other. I had the odd annoyance about something but we never fought and considered ourselves sisters. 

We ended up in different places for college and saw each other when we were back home but this is when things started to change. Basically I found her very self-centred, slightly annoying, not very kind and found that she didn’t seem to care about what’s happening in my life. I’d started to notice she would only speak about herself, and never ask even one question about me. 

I tested it out one time and didn’t say anything other than to respond to her stories (mostly about her failed relationships/work) and she didn’t say or notice anything. Another time I tried out starting topics of conversation about my life (which doesn’t come naturally to me) without a prompt and she even ended up talking over me. 

For years I tried to excuse it - she was dealing with a bad family bereavement at one point, bad relationships another time - but it’s just continued. I feel like we’re getting more and more different over time but I wanted to hold onto the friendship due to the genuine and loving bond we used to have, and the fact that she isn’t actually mean, abusive, manipulative, etc. 

I never confronted it but thought that maybe we’d naturally drift apart and become more like acquaintances. But two years ago she moved to the same big city as me and has made it clear she values our friendship and organises to see me often. 

She’s genuinely well meaning but I still just find her really difficult to hang out with and often quite annoying. When hanging out with her roommates, I noticed that she talks over them, moves the conversation to her boyfriend and her work constantly. I had to make an effort to ask them questions and allow them to speak. 

So my question is: what do I do?? I’m all for cutting toxic people out of your life but she really isn’t, she’s just mildly annoying (to me). I feel bad because I’m one of her few friends in the city whereas I have a big social group. I also don’t want to ruin what has been a very long, uncomplicated friendship. 

Maybe I’m the horrible one, please let me know what you think! I just don’t want to hurt her. 

Tl;dr: I don’t get on with my friend anymore, she seems oblivious to this, what do I do?

"Threesome turned really bad


Me (26) and my bf (27) have been in a great relationship since 2 years. Our sexlife was always excellent and we felt very sexure in our relationship. We have tried a MFF before that went very well and we wanted to try again with a guy this time.

After chosing the guy (22) we made plans for last saturday and it went terrible. My boyfriend could not get an errection the whole time but wanted us to continue so we went ahead and it was really great for me but at one point I noticed my bf wasnt even there anymore. I didnt notice him leaving but when I saw that he wasnt there I looked for him and sent the other guy home.

Bf came home couple hours later looking like he had cried and ignored me for the rest of the night.

Since then my bf barely speaks to me and doesnt look me in the eyes anymore. I think what made him feel insecure was the other guys size even though my bf is not small at all. Maybe he didnt like seeing me being into it as much as I was. I am really heartbroken and I dont know what to do to fix this.

Please let me know what I could do to help him get over this!!!

tl,dr bf left during threesome and has been acting really cold towards me since"
"I (19f) can't get over my boyfriend's (20m) former girlfriends


 

I was really close with my current boyfriend (a little over a year) before we started dating. I had the biggest crush on him but he didn't want to ruin our friendship. I told him that I had a crush on him but he still got together with this slutty girl who was cheating on his girlfriend with him. At this point, I stopped talking to him for my own mental health. The rejection paired with him going after this other girl was too much for me to bear. I thought I could remain friends with him but passing over me when I was head over heels made me feel like I wasn't worthy of *anyone's* love.

After this girlfriend, he continued to sleep around with whoever at parties and whatnot. He's been my only partner and I estimate he's been with more than 10 girls. Is it shallow that I care so much about this? He continued to be friends with benefits with another ex-girlfriend. He would even leave us hanging out to go fuck this other girl (which fucked me up, to be honest). Right before I left the state for college, we became friends again. I left, fell head over heels for the first boy that paid attention to me and broke up with him in about 3 days. Eventually, me and my boyfriend started dating after he realized he was always jealous of people I was seeing.

One of the women he slept with texted him the other night trying to patch up their friendship. This brought back a lot of bad feelings for me. How I stood by and watched my heart get ripped out every time he fucked another girl. How he slept with whoever he wanted to even though I was right there. And how he hangs out with this group from work and I know he's slept with a few of the girls in that friend group (one of them being the one that texted him).

I hate hanging out with all of them and I have no idea how he does it. I don't talk to the boys I even had crushes on before him. He got insanely jealous right before he asked me out when a boy texted me wanting to catch up. But he still hangs out with some of the girls he fucked. I know they were one night stands and there were no emotions involved for him but I still can't help but feel like he settled for me. I don't want to be that psycho girlfriend who tells him who he can and can't hang out with but he said he'd block her if it made me feel better.

I'm so fucked. Am I being the asshole because I can't get over his ex-girlfriends and lovers? I know it was all in the past but so many of them were casual sex that I don't know if he has the same views on sex as I do. I don't know how to feel about all of this. I feel like such an asshole because he's never been in a serious relationship before me. I know he loves me a lot but I sometimes I just can't get over how hurt I was years ago.

TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriends settled for me because he fucked a bunch of other girls after I told him I was into him. I can't help but feel hurt about this still after being with him for over a year.

"I’m (F27) concerned about one of my boyfriend’s (M29) female friends


We’ve been together for a couple of months now and he makes me incredibly happy. We have a lot in common, as we’re both avid climbers. Climbing is a relatively newer hobby of mine. I’ve spent the last five years working diligently on my doctorate, which I finished a couple of months ago. With more free time, I’ve started climbing outdoors, learning advanced climbing techniques, and going on camping trips specifically focused on climbing (multiple days in the desert). Admittedly, my lack of real camping experience is something I am self-conscious about, as my boyfriend and I are in the initial stages of dating. I am still trying on some level to live up to a rugged outdoorsy appearance. That being said, I DO enjoy these trips, however this point will become relevant in the next part of this post.

My boyfriend has been doing the outdoor climbing/camping thing for the past couple of years. He is a prolific climber and has a group of friends who go to really cool places (the Sierra Nevadas, Mt. Whitney, etc.) who are also very into photography.

Enter the woman who is making me uncomfortable. She (F, late twenty something) is often the token woman who goes on these trips, as climbing is often male dominated. When I first perused her Instagram account, I noticed immediately that most of her pictures are pouty, overly-edited selfies. Some of her pictures are provocative poses, where she is scantily clad and sticking out certain parts of her body.

There are hot springs near many of the places we camp/climb at, and when I brought this up to my boyfriend, he showed me a picture he had taken of the climbing group in a hot spring (a silly one of the boys with their butts to the camera). Somehow it came out that of the two girls in the picture, the girl who makes me uncomfortable was topless in a hot spring with a bunch of guys, including my boyfriend (who was not naked, as he is somewhat conservative), and that he hadn’t realized she was topless when he took it. The other girl was wearing a bikini top.

I do not like this woman, as I feel she is attention-seeking and overtly sexual in her attempts to do so. I do not trust her. Before anyone hotly criticizes me for not being sexually liberated or insecure about my own relationship, I am neither of these things. Even if I were married to my boyfriend, I would not be cool with another woman prancing around naked in front of us.

Before I knew this about her, I had agreed to go on a camping trip with my boyfriend, her, and another guy friend. After learning about this, I have decided I don’t want to go. The camping trip was originally for my birthday.

I feel that I am not in a place to openly cast judgement and express concern over this woman, as I do not know her very well. I also know that she is an integral part of this group of guys, as she is also a professional photographer, so for some reason or another, I am currently outnumbered in my opinions. When I restated the story to a close girlfriend, she reached the same conclusion I did and understood why I was apprehensive to form any sort of relationship with this person.

In addition to the camping trip which I no longer want to go on, we are slated to climb in a large group together at the end of March.

I am worried that if I cancel going on the camping trip, my boyfriend will perceive me as less outdoorsy. At the same time, it’s my birthday and I refuse to spend it in an environment in which I’m uncomfortable.

How do I go about cancelling going on this trip without revealing what appears to be unfounded discomfort? And how should I handle my interactions with this person on the trip in a couple of months?

**TL;DR**My boyfriend and I were invited to go camping for my birthday with a girl I do not trust. I want to avoid the trip entirely, however I agreed to go before learning more about her attention-seeking behavior."
"Major crush on married coworker who doesn't want me, while another coworker is crushing on me


I am a female and have an intense crush on a co-worker. I feel like I may be in love with him.  Only problem is he is married and has kids, and isn't interested in me at all. For a time I had worked closely with him, and I soon started to develop a strong attraction. This was made worse by the fact he would do little things for me to show he cared, or so I had thought. This feeling is torturing me, and I have had this crush for at least 18 months now. It's come to a point if I even see him I go crazy and feel depressed because I can't be with him. I know it's all wrong, he's been married for many years and would never leave his wife. He also has children, and he has told me he isn't interested in me that way and we can't have anything more ever. But I can't help how I feel about him and can't let go. 

Now there is another guy (Steve) in the office who appears to really like me a lot. We don't really work together, but he introduced himself and comes by my desk to say hi and talk. He has asked me to go for coffee and I declined. I do like him, but my head is so messed up thinking about the married co-worker.  As Steve has been a little persistent, I went to lunch with him and dinner after work one night. He is so nice, but my intense crush on married co-worker is making me see have mixed feelings for Steve and I feel like I am betraying married co-worker by engaging in deeper feeling with Steve. Even though I think it's better for me to try going out with Steve so I can move on. I don't want to hurt him, but right now I only see him as a good friend because I don't want to let go of my true love (married man). 

Does anyone have any advice? I feel so unhappy and miserable not able to be with my married crush, and Steve seems like he is crazy about me now and even told me so when we went for dinner. He is single with no children, and would obviously be the right choice. But I don't want to let go of the married co-worker in case there is even a very small chance one day I could be with him. 

TL;DR - have a major crush and inlove with a married co-worker, but he doesn't want me. Another guy has crush on me but I only want to be friends right now. "
"Things going well, then he (41M) texts me (39F) he wants to see another woman exclusively...THEN he says it doesn't have to be goodbye for us...?!


I've been seeing this guy for about 8 weeks, and we've really hit it off. The conversation is good, the attraction is there, and we genuinely have fun with each other. This morning he sent me a text that he wants to see where it's going to go with another woman he met before me. (We were being exclusive as of beginning of January). I am polite but a bit heartbroken. I give him an out, saying, ""Well, if it's not there, it's not there."" And he says, ""No, it's there. I definitely feel things with you."" And goes on to say that he never expected this level of connection with one person, let alone two. I'm honest with him in that I didn't expect to be taking this so hard, but I definitely thought this was the beginning of something great. He says ""It doesn't have to be goodbye"" and then tells me he meant what he said to me a few weeks ago (drunkenly talking love stuff...both of us). We're meeting up tonight. He said he truly misses me and very much wants to see me. I'm confused as hell, because...he seems to still want to be with me? WTH? What should I do? I'm not going to make a damn powerpoint of why he should be with me...I don't want to be with anyone that doesn't want to be with me. But there is definitely a spark between us. Thoughts?

"How can I (23F) encourage my husband (25M) to seek therapy/counseling?


My husband has had a few incidents where I've thought maybe there's something going on that he should see someone about. I know that he saw a therapist in high school and was put on antidepressants, but he stopped taking them because his mom called them his ""crazy pills"". 

He had what I can only describe as a breakdown last night. He was frustrated with me and said he was going to show me how ridiculous I was being when I want him to comfort me when I'm sad about something that is my own fault (like one of my friends being mad at me because something I did upset her). So he started slapping his face as hard as he could and complaining that it hurt and could I make it stop. I thought it was very over the top, so I tried to ignore him. It got worse. I went to the bathroom to get ready for bed, and he followed me and blocked the doorway, continuing to slap himself as hard as he could. I asked him to stop and to move. He said no and stood in the doorway, glaring at me and slapping his face. I finally pushed past him and got into bed. He stopped then, but started yelling at me that I don't care about him, I'm selfish, and he hates me and wants a divorce. And then he sobbed on the floor for at least 30 minutes. It was a pretty scary experience for me. He seemed... A little unhinged. When he eventually calmed down, he  didn't want to talk to me  or be around me. I think he needs to see a counselor or psychiatrist but his high school experience has made him hate therapy and he refuses to go. I want to help him, but I just don't know how. 

For the record, he has never hit me or even threatened to do so, and I wasn't worried about him doing so last night. But still, it was like a completely different person had taken on his appearance. 

Tl;dr: Husband had what I suspect is a breakdown, and I don't know how to help him. "
"Fiancé (28m) recently angry/suspicious of me (27f). Am I the person who is not understanding?


We’ve been together for 3 years. Lately late at night he’ll get really suspicious of the things I say. Almost paranoid. I jokingly asked when we’ll be able to afford a maid (we both work long hours and don’t have a lot of time to clean) and he said his mom could help clean when she moved in with us. I said I’d prefer for us to have a few years of living together as a couple without any guests when we buy our home before she moves in. He got really defensive and asked me how many years I needed before that time. I said I wasn’t sure but we’d figure it out around the time we’d start having kids. He started asking me pointed questions suggesting I didn’t want his mom to move in and asking me if I had a problem with his mom. I don’t! I love his mom! But guess what, I don’t even want to live with my own mother before I have some time to enjoy our first home. 

He made gave me a list of reasons why I was being disrespectful to his mom and shut down the conversation without giving me a chance to respond. I got so mad that he shut me down like that I told him I’d sleep on the couch. He sent me a weird “either understand my mom’s important to me or we’re over” text. Mind you I UNDERSTAND. I AM NOT SAYING NO TO HER MOVING IN. 

This is the second night that he’s accused me of stuff and been so hostile I’ve had to sleep on the sofa (my decision). I can’t afford to go to work overtired and I’m not budging on my needing time before she moves in. I don’t understand why it’s such a big issue??? She has a great life, she’s perfectly healthy, and there is no immediate need for her to be living with us. This is just bizarre. I’m so pissed because I work full time, I’m in school, I carry my weight in this house, and this is a decision for both of us where we should be able to express our feelings without them getting twisted. 

Tl;dr. My fiancé got mad that I didn’t want his mom to move in with us immediately and gave me an ultimatum over it. "
"My (21/f) boss (60-70s/m) gave me my check yesterday and told me not to cash it till feb 1st, I need to cash the check. What do I do?


I’m a college student and I work in a law office Monday’s, Wednesday’s, and Friday’s. I’m not on payroll so my boss just rights up my checks for me every week, for the previous week. So yesterday I got my check for the last week. He had his paralegal give it to me and she told me not to cash it till the 1st. The reason for that was because he sends a summary of his monthly transactions to his accountant for tax purposes and he had already sent his accountant his overview for this month and me cashing my check would skew the numbers. He also dated the check for feb 1st. Now the problem is, I’m in college and like basically every college student out there, I’m living paycheck to paycheck. Therefore, I can’t wait 4 extra days to get the money. I have bills that are due and my rent to pay. One of my roommates has Venmo requested me for bills this month and I told them I’d pay them Monday when I got paid and they said cool, but now I can’t do that because I don’t have $200 to spare in my account. I don’t fee comfortable with telling my boss/the paralegal I need to cash that check to literally pay my bills, is there anything I can do? 

TL;DR my boss told me not to cash my check till the 1st, I need to cash it "
"I (21/M) feel like I accidently pressure my GF (20/F) for sex.


First off I know this sounds bad and I honestly don't know if it is true. 

For some background, my girlfriend and I have been best friends since the 8th grade (about 7 years) but we have only been dating for a little over a year. All throughout high school and her freshman year of college she was dating a guy who ended up cheating on her multiple times and the basicallthg used her for sex. She was afraid of leaving him because she thought that she would never find anyone else. Well she eventually broke up with him and a couple months later we got together. Meanwhile I had a few ""relotionships"" in high school that really ended up being friendships. (Nothing really happened expect for hanging out a lot. Never had my first kiss or slept with anyone).

Flash foreward to now where my girlfriend and I are really happy with each other. We both deeply love each other and know that we will marry each other after college. We are pretty much extremely open with one another and talk about everything. She was my first kiss, and I lost my virginity to her. 

She has expressed multiple times that she doesn't care about sex and would be fine without it (because of her past relationship). I personally am a very sexual person but I never would want to pressure her. We tend to have sex most nights we see each other (she goes to a college about 2 hours away so I try to visit on weekends at least once a week or every 2 weeks.) I always ask if she is okay with it before we start to and she laughs and says yes basically saying i didnt need to ask. I always tell her if she doesn't want to have sex she can tell me no and stop me that i wouldn't be mad or dissapointed and she says ""I know.""

But I always feel like somehow I am pressuring her and she is just too afraid to tell me. And anytime I ask her about it she says I'm crazy and I am not pressuring her.

Am I just overthinking things?

TL:DR My girlfriend doesn't care about have sex but we have sex a lot. She says I don't pressure her and she wants to but I have a scary feeling in the back of my mind that I really am.

"
"My [26] gf [23] is visibly annoyed her ex has moved on but says she doesn't has feelings for him.


I'm literally just going to write things down as it happened and I'm sorry if it's too long and messy but please bear with me.

So I met this girl in the first week of Jan this year. We hit it off really well. She's everything I look for in a girl - she's super smart, good career, funny, good looking, someone I can roast and who'll give it back equally etc. And she's SUPER into me....

....almost too much. She tells me to take her home on the first date (this isn't a common thing in my country). She tells me she loves me the same night. I tell her that she possibly couldn't be in love since we've only known each other for 2 days and she says that that's just how she is, that she's a little impulsive and if she feels something emotionally, she isn't afraid to say it if it feels right.

Now, I have MAJOR trust issues. I haven't emotionally opened up to a girl in over 7 years. Purely out of the fear of getting hurt. So I tell her that it'll take me some time to completely open up to her emotionally, let alone fall in love with her. She tells me she doesn't want to be just a casual thing for me but is very understanding about the whole thing albeit a little hurt that her feelings aren't being reciprocated. I have a talk with my boys about how I really, really like this girl but I'm not ready for a serious relationship because I find it hard to emotionally trust someone. They say that I have to get it over my issues at some point in my life and if I block myself from my feelings then I'll never be able to get over it. So I decide to man the fuck up, not avoid my feelings and just see what happens even if I end up getting hurt. Meanwhile, she's on a work trip, gets super, super drunk (she can't handle her alcohol at all) and ends up having a threesome with 2 of her colleagues (both girls). You have to understand one thing about her that she's **very** **honest**. Almost to a fault. Hasn't lied to me about anything, doesn't lie to her mom at all (her mom is very wary about her dating guys because of her first boyfriend who was emotionally abusive and toxic, and they fight ALOT whenever she tells her shes with me. I tell her to just lie and say she's at a friend's place since it'll make things easier but she refuses to do it.) She immediately calls me and tells me she fucked up and doesn't want to lose me. She sounds super drunk and weirdly enough, I didn't mind too much since she hooked up with girls and not some random guy so I tell her I'm ok with it as long as she doesn't do it again.

*Over the next couple of weeks*
We spend alot of time together, I meet her friends, she meets mine, we talk over the phone every chance we get, the sex is amazing and I start becoming very emotionally invested in her but as we get to know each other better I find out things about her that *aren't pretty*- she has **major** mood swings because of her anxiety and depression. Truth be told, she is a little crazy, self admittedly.

The weird thing is although we're in an exclusive relationship, she refuses to put a label on this and call me her bf but talks about our future(marriage) all the time. She says she doesn't mind if I introduce her to others as my gf but she won't call me her bf because she says doesn't like being confined and it's been the same way with all her exes.

She had just gotten out of a relationship (her 2nd bf) in November 2018 and the breakup was very messy. She still talks to her ex over email sometimes (which I didn't mind) but she says fell out of love with him months before the break up and is completely over him. Everytime he messages her, she lets me know about it - He's very hurt that she moved on and slept with someone so quickly and that she could've waited since he is going to move back to the city soon (it was a long distance relationship).

One day after a minor fight, I got hold of her phone, and I decided to read her emails with her ex and to my relief whatever she told me them was the truth. The content was just her telling him that she had no feelings for him anymore and him being annoyed that she's moved on. This reinforced, in my mind, that she's very honest with me.

2 nights ago we have a huge fight over how I'm not as emotionally invested in the relationship as she is (she was feeling very violent emotionally because of her periods + mood swings + depression) and tbh I could've handled the whole situation better. After the fight she tells me that she emailed her ex because she was pissed off at me. He tells her that he's met someone who's alot nicer than her, that they're talking about a serious long term relationship and that hes coming to the city on the 30th to meet her. Over the past 2 days she hasn't shut up about this. Everytime we talk on the phone, she talks about this. We have sex, the first thing she talks about after, is this.

""I can't believe he's moved on so quickly""
""He hasn't even met her yet and they're discussing an LTR""
I ask her why this is bothering her so much:
""He kept gaslighting me throughout our relationship about how I didn't love him &amp; he loved me more and now he's moved on so quickly."" 

This has been really bothering me because it makes me think she still has feelings for him but she says she doesn't. Considering she's always been honest with me, I'm inclined to believe her but her actions say otherwise. I feel like I'm being used as an emotional rebound but she says otherwise. I think she just really liked that fact that he wasn't over her but maybe I'm just making excuses for her? Things have stopped making sense to me. It feels like things are going to get messier when he comes back here tomorrow and tells her all about the things he did with that girl.

This might sound like a ranf but I need you guys to tell me if I should end this before it gets worse or if I should just trust her? 

tl;dr : My gf is very annoyed her ex has moved on but insists she doesn't have feelings for him. Since she's **very** honest with me, I'm inclined to believe her but I need another perspective on this.

"I [22F] had a misunderstanding with my boyfriend [22M] and he won’t believe me.


Today he didn’t tell me that he was waiting for me in the hall outside of a meeting at school, and I was talking to some other people in my program as we walked out, and suddenly he called my name and said that he had been calling me down the hall as I walked out.
I didn’t hear him so I said “oh hi! I’m sorry I didn’t see you.”

He rolled his eyes, said bye, and walked away upset.

I texted him to ask what was wrong and he said “I waited thirty minutes just for you to ignore me. You wasted my time. You fucked up so fuck off.”

I said I was sorry, that I didn’t know he was waiting for me, and didn’t hear him.”

He said that I need to stop making excuses and that he’s tired of me making him depressed.

I asked him to talk to me, but he’s ignoring me now. What do I do?

**tl;dr : boyfriend doesn’t believe me and is upset about a misunderstanding**

Edit: He does this a lot where all of the sudden he takes a different meaning from my actions and words. I always say that I’m sorry even when I’m confused and it takes him a really long time to “forgive me” and he holds these things over my head for a really long time."
"A guy [26M] I met online got angry with me [22F]. Now I don’t really want to meet him.


Hello,

So a few months ago I [22F] met this guy [26M] online and we’ve been talking for a while. I went travelling for a little bit so we couldn’t catch up while I was away but we still talked. Iv been back for about 2 weeks now and we were thinking of organising a time to catch up, but since I’ve been away and just recently returned I have been a bit busy and not much spare time. So we‘re planned to meet up in about a week and half from now. 

But two days ago, he wanted to catch up. And I said let’s see how the day goes (because I already had plans and didn’t know when they were ending). We did not set a time or anything, it was not even certain we could catch up today. So it was about lunch time and I judged I probably wouldn’t have some free time so I let him know. And he got so mad at me for it! And it wasn’t a situation where I bailed, it was just we were playing by ear and it wasn’t going to work that day. 
He pretty much said he doesn’t want know me anymore and insulted me at one point. He also said he moved thing around so he could see me (which is found confusing since we didn’t even set a time..)

After he calmed down I spoke to him again and he apologised. He said he was just frustrated because he wanted to meet up and felt like I didn’t ...

Now I don’t really want to meet this guy. I mean I barely know him, and i haven’t really done anything to warrant that sort of behaviour. I 1) have made time available to him. It’s not ideal because it’s a bit further away in time but I couldn’t see him any earlier so there’s not much I can do about that.. 2) did not bail, or organise a time with him etc. it was a purely let’s see how the day goes, you do your thing and later on if we’re both free we can catch up otherwise next time. 

I feel like he severely over reacted and it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I don’t really know what to do. I am still seeing him in a week and a half but not sure how I feel about it anymore ... 
I feel like that sort of behaviour is a big red flag. I’m just not sure what to do, never been in this situation before.

Thank you 

TL;DR: a guy I met online got mad at me for not meeting up when I wasn’t even available. He now makes me feel a bit uncomfortable and not sure what to do. "
"My (30M) gf (27F) left because she's suffering a burnout. What should I do ? Move on because she's undermined ?


Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Let's call my now-ex-gf ""Lily"". We have spent 7 years together. I knew her when she was 21, she was in med school. She's good at it, always working too much to get good grades. Often scoring in the top 20 and lastly in the top 10.

She's now specializing and still has 2.5 years to go. In total it's 13 years, 7 years of university and 6 to get the specialization (Gastroenterology).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since Augustus 2018 our couple is suffering and falling apart. She always had stress/anxiety problems but lately it has been out of control. Crying all the time, complaining about her job all the time, telling me she doesn't want to go to work when she has 24h shifts. She had 3 panic attacks that I managed to calm down, making her focus on her breathing, guiding her with a calm comforting voice : 3 seconds inhale, 3 seconds exhale (quite proud, I've never tried this and it worked).

&amp;#x200B;

I've never complained about this situation, not once. Med school is tough, specializing is even worse. Basically, she's forced to work at least 70h/week, with night shifts. If this is hard on me, what is it for her ?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on my career too, I'm following night classes, I'd like to be self employed in the HVAC field. I've been doing crazy hours too and I'm doing really well so far. I think walking this path is good for me and so far one of the best decisions in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her opinion before starting this and she was 200% behind it. I've been renovating a house I bought and doing well, I'm good at it (entire roof, floors, bearing walls). I love it - hence the HVAC studies.

I told her this decision wasn't that easy, I told her about the crazy hours, I told her I would have to stop the house completely for 3 years, 2 to 4 night classes per week. No more vacations because I need at least 250h of practical work with a HVAC contractor, each year, to get access to the next.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this while working a full time job that requires a lot of my time. I warned her about all of this. It wouldn't be easy, I would be tired, sometimes exhausted.

""It's Okay, we will find a way. Go for it !""

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I went to see her parents and mine to present my idea. Her father is an engineer and very down to earth, he asked a lot of questions and finally told me : ""Sounds good, it's a nice project"".

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I started working towards this crazy dream in 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Something else happened though :  in Augustus 2018, I started to have massive migraines all the time, nauseous all the time, severely impaired, exhausted, sick, my guts working randomly, clogged nose. I've had this since I'm 22 but only 3 to 4 times a years. Not every day for months.

&amp;#x200B;

A gastroenterologist told me he couldn't help because he was the wrong doctor, I needed to see a neurologist. The first one told me it was in my head, I had to quit my job and start relaxing, hiking, taking walks in the woods. The second one tried triptans and topamax (antiepileptic stuff with a lot of side effects).

&amp;#x200B;

Severely impaired, I started to miss work. I never miss work, even with fever I go to work. Still, I kept my job and the classes going. Bed-bound on the weekends to recover enough to survive the next week.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I found help and I'm doing fine since the beginning of this year. They made me reduce the amount of carbohydrates I eat, cut all grains, be sure to get enough sodium every day and throughout the day, get at least 60% of my caloric intake from fats. I think I'll be put on a ketogenic diet soon. Something with my brain going crazy with carbs and the insulin. Also alcohol makes me super sick, it's a vasodilatator and my brain can't stand it anymore. Not a single glass.

It's been a month, I'm on a somewhat strict diet and I stick to it because it works. I'm myself again.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this happened when Lily was already burning out. Lily started being quite aggressive toward me, this never happened in 7 years. She blamed me for ""not seeking help"" and doing nothing. This came from nowhere because I already had two appointments with two neurologists and was trying everything the internet could offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other week she told me how my condition was annoying and weighing on her. At the same time, she started wanting to go out. I feel we started bargaining my health for some nights out. Saying ""no"" wans't an option and I said things like ""Ok but until midnight"", ""Ok but I don't feel well, I need to get back early, like really early"". Please note that she has her freedom, I don't mind if she goes out without me. And she did a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

One Sunday, while taking a walk in Brussels, just trying to have a good time, I felt sick. I told her ""I'm sorry but I don't feel so well"" she responded with ""Seriously ?! You're never happy !"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew she wasn't doing fine, I saw her pain, I tried everything, went beyond my limits. In October I went to see her parents, seeking help and answers. What am I doing wrong ? What can I do ?

&amp;#x200B;

We had another fight in December. We where supposed to go to the sea with her family. Friday after work, I asked if we could take the road in the morning because I was so sick and exhausted. She told me to suck it up, I could rest in the car, it wouldn't kill me and she wanted to enjoy the evening.

This was too much and I stopped talking, I didn't say a single word the rest of the evening. When I get mad, I don't yell, I don't insult her, I don't get physical, I simply stop talking. I shut up. It was the first time I really lost my cool in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

This was too much for her, the weekend was awful. Something broke in her, she seemed so sad, we barely spoke. I came back on Sunday with her father because we both had to work on Monday. 

She texted me and told me she was lost, not mad or something but she needed time and not seeing each other for a week would be good. This hurt me so much, my heart skipped a beat.

&amp;#x200B;

I took my time to write the answer because anything I did, tried or said so far, was wrong or not enough. I wrote a nice answer, telling her how sorry I am she feels so bad and this situation hurts. I wished her well and told her everything would be Ok.

&amp;#x200B;

During the week I was desperate, I asked her father if could come see him. We talked a lot, it was a good talk. He told me he never saw Lily like that, crying day and night and not eating. He told me she wanted a change in our lives, she couldn't bear anymore to only work all the time. She wanted more time with friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw Lily in the following days, we finally had a real talk. She was super sad but calm, she basically repeated what her father told me and now she needed time, a break in our relationship. She could have said so earlier, she didn't communicate. I tried to understand, I asked for help and advice. While writting all this, it seems crystal-clear. If only I knew how far she was...

&amp;#x200B;

This tore me apart, I was losing her. I respected her demands. We didn't see each other for a month, we only talked one time per week on the phone. On the phone, it was always about her, again she dumped on me her stress and complained about her job. I listened and tried to cheer her up. She never asked what I did for Christmas, for New year's eve or how I was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We finally saw each other the last WE. We were supposed to move out to a new place, her sister's apartment. Thing is, she moved out without me, I helped her move the rest of her stuff Sunday morning and when we arrived she said ""Welcome to my home!"". She didn't want me to live with her anymore, not yet. She wanted to live alone for a month or two to prove everyone she was capable to live on her own.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She had bought all the stuff we were missing and that we were supposed to buy together.

&amp;#x200B;

I had her Christmas gifts. I received nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

In the bed she told me she wanted the cursor to be a bit more focused on her. Everything is already for her, I don't exist anymore. I almost quit my job to free more time, but my bosses agreed to let me work halftime. I was about to postpone some of my classes. I counted how much money I would lose by selling my house in the current state. I even offered her to seek help together at some point. What else did she want ?

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I took a few more hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday evening it was too much. She seemed happy unpacking her new stuff but I couldn't take it anymore. I told her I was about to leave her, for the first time I spoke about myself, my feelings, my pain. I tried to be as positive as I could, avoiding reproaches and trying to spare her. She cried and apologized, she didn't realize how sick I was and she never meant to hurt me.

We cried. She asked me to stay, I stayed. Monday morning, she asked if we could see each other during the week. I told her everything would be OK once again.

&amp;#x200B;

When we saw each other again, I offered a new start, respecting her wishes and capacities of the moment. I'm always optimistic, I'm not resentful, it's far from too late. Nothing I said could help it, she told me her pain was too great, she wanted it to stop. She barely has enough strength for herself, she has none left for us. We kissed and said a long goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn apart, brokenhearted, emotionally worn out, I feel exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

Some cons :

&amp;#x200B;

She has always been self-centered, she's a bit like that (for everything, even sex). She's not very supportive and often gives me the last kick when I have trouble. She complains when I'm not at 100% and don't give her enough attention. But these traits exploded lately. 

I've had a feeling a couple of times, a thought during our relationship : it's a bit one sided, maybe you could be better with someone else ?

I guess everyone has doubts at some time and the grass is always greener on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Is it time to move on ? Really ? Only because she's undermined ?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I selfish ? An asshole ?

&amp;#x200B;

I sent her a last message. Telling her my door wasn't closed and if she wanted and felt like it, she could always contact me. Maybe it wouldn't be too late. In the meantime I was going to try to move on and I would not be waiting. She will always have a special place in me.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me the only thing she could do now was to try to get better. She promised me to recontact me if she could find the strength to pursue our relationship and above all, be good to our relationship. Even if it would mean receiving a painful refusal which she would understand because I don't have to be waiting. I'll always have a special place in her heart, no matter what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : My 7 years gf is undermined by her work, burned-out or depressed. I had health issues, she blamed me for it. Now we are both hurt and she doesn't have enough strength to be in a relationship. Any advice or words would be appreciated. I lost my second half, my best friend.

"Husband of 5 years send dick pic and blames it on my chronic back pain


It all started a few months back. I was a bit distant with him because i was working full time, despite chronic back pain, which meant I just wanted to sleep when I could and sex was painful.

I asked him if he was ok before I went to work one day and he told me he wanted to die. Managed to get off work and went home to find out he'd sent a dick pic that morning because he felt I was always ""busy"" ( 2 young kids, chronic pain, job in management, only person in the house that does washing, tidying, cooking or cleaning etc)

Just start trusting him again and then he goes out on Christmas day, gets hammered and doesn't come home until an hour after I had told him I'd be serving first course and laughs when his brother calls me a bitch.

Then, on new years eve (a night we'd planned on spending together)  he tells me he's bored. I tell him to go to his friends house if he's wanting to party, he tells me he'll he back by 1am (without prompting, I actually didn't care) and he stumbles in at 4am and says I'm a bitch for asking him to be home by 1am (NEVER HAPPENED).

A week ago I told him I'm not happy, and he cried and told me to give him a chance. Am I a horrible bitch for thinking I deserve better/we'd both be better off apart?

Tl;dr my husband sent a dick pic, stays out hours after he says he'll be home and blames my back pain for it."
"My [19M] girlfriend [18F] of eight months won't stop freaking out about being pregnant, even after she had her period


A little backstory. My girlfriend was raised pretty strict baptist, was a virgin before she met me. We had sex in early January (her first time) twice over the course of two weekends. 

Both times we used a condom. The first time I didn't finish because I was too focused on making her first time enjoyable. I pulled out and finished on her the second time. About a week later (also one week before her period) she started to worry that she was pregnant because she had been peeing more often. I was pretty confident that she wasn't because we were smart and safe and all that jazz, but I understood why it would be such a scary thing for a girl especially one who had never had sex. So I reassured her that she hadn't gotten pregnant and that even if she had we would figure it out and I would support her through whatever decisions she made regarding the pregnancy yadda yadda yadda. 

She got her period the exact day she was supposed to and all was good, or at least I thought. Today she texted me and told me she was worrying again because she always feels nauseous in the mornings and she felt ""a weight"" in her stomach yesterday. I am extremely confident that she isn't pregnant since we haven't had sex since her period. 

It is really starting to stress me out and get on my nerves. I want to be there and be supportive for her but it seems like the paranoia is getting to a level of unreasonable. Am I being a dick? What do I need to do in order to help her through this? We were going to have sex tomorrow but I told her that I don't want to have sex because this amount of worrying and stress can't be good for her health physically or mentally. The lack of sex and the stress is wearing on me and quickly. Thanks

TL;DR: Girlfriend isn't pregnant, thinks she is and it is really putting a strain on me and her"
"How do I (25F) coexist in the same friend group as my ex (25M)


My ex and I met in grad school (which we are still in). We have the same group of friends and were friends before we dated. We broke up in November after about a year and a half of dating. 

Our friends regularly have social gatherings in which we are both invited to. We've spoken briefly one-on-one and it seems to have been fine, but when we are in a social situation he pretty much ignores me entirely. Am I wrong for wanting some sort of interaction here? I obviously have no idea how he is feeling, maybe he never wants to see me again but we usually interact weekly, so that's not really possible.
I thought about talking to him about this, but am also unsure of how to go about that (or if it's a good idea). 

Any advice is appreciated!

tl;dr: Bf and I broke up, but still have to see each other almost weekly at social gatherings with same group of friends. How to proceed? "
"My (22M) girlfriend (21F) cheated on me with one of my friends


We’ve been dating for over three years and love each other a lot. We went through a rough patch recently and she felt as though I wasn’t showing her enough love. One night when we were both drunk I passed out and she ended up having sex with one of my friends. They stopped in the middle of it and both felt really bad about doing it. They decided that they would tell me they had just kissed as to not hurt my feelings as much, but to still tell me something had happened. It was a couple days until I was able to pry the information from my girlfriend that they had sex and not actually kissed. She says she was just trying to protect my feelings and that is why she didn’t tell me the truth, and that the sex didn’t have any meaning to her it just reflected how upset she was at the time. I feel lied to and used and I’m not sure what to do with my girlfriend or friend. They both feel really guilty about it and my girlfriend keeps promising that this is a one time mistake and that it has showed her how much she loves me. I feel too hurt to make a rational decision with either of them and wanted some advice from someone who has dealt with a similar situation or known someone who has. I still love my girlfriend a lot and feel like this could help us realize how much we mean to each other moving forward, but I also feel like my trust is to betrayed to move forward with her as well. 

Tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me with one of my friends while drunk, but they stopped and felt guilty. They lied to protect my feelings and I’m not sure how to move forward with either of them. "
"My (28M) girlfriend (27F) panics at the thought of my greatest desire


 

I have been in a relationship with my 27  year old girlfriend for about 6 months now. We love each other to death,  she is everything I could ever want in a woman. We are very comfortable  and open with each other, have no problems talking about sex and sexual  things we want to try. However when I mentioned my biggest kink (&gt;!anal!&lt;)  she started to panic, thinking that she wasn't good enough and why  would I want that, the fact that she has abandonment issues does not  help. Twice we've discussed it, and both times she has freaked out about  it, being worried that I might leave her because of it. In the effort  of not making her worry I've heavily downplayed how much I enjoy it and  the idea of it, when the truth is it is by far my biggest turn on. We  have lots of sex, it's amazing and I love her more than anything, but  the thought of never fulfilling that desire is getting to me. I have  been very open to everything she wants to do, and have refrained from  mentioning my interest again for fear of making her feel bad or worst  case, losing her. We haven't actually done any of the stuff we want to  try, just discussed it so far.

On the  one hand I have been lying about how much I want to do it, but on the  other it was prevent her from feeling unsatisfactory. I love her and  would do anything for her, but my sex life feels unfulfilled and  lacking. I dread the thought of her leaving me because ""she doesn't want  to be that"" for me, but I feel unsatisfied and down about never doing  it. How can I approach her with this?

Thank you.

 

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* Girlfriend hates the idea of my biggest kink, sexlife feels unfulfilled and lacking because of it. How do I talk to her about it?

"My friends [21f 22f] keep giving me [23f] ""why don't you just..."" Advice that is kinda condescending.



I'm going through some tough stuff, and my friends Jade and Eliza keep giving me advice that is a little idealistic honestly. 

Someone at work was harassing me, and my friends were like ""Just tell HR, they'll deal with it"". HR tried to make me switch to a different job that I didn't want, with no consequences for the guy. They honestly tried to shame me into keeping the fact that mycoworker was a creepy fucker quiet, so they probably did more harm than good.

Then, it was ""just get a lawyer"". With whose money??? I looked into it and I could not afford it.

""Why don't you ask your coworkers for help with the harassment?"" Because they're buddies with the guy who's done it and think that stuff is fine

""Why don't you just get a new job?"" Well I'm trying but it's not instant.

""Why don't you quit and move in with your parents for a while?"" Who, the alcoholic assholes that I've hardly spoken to for years? That's gonna make me even worse off.

""Why don't you just go to the police?"" I already did and they took a report and didn't do shit afterwards. Said it was more of a HR Matter than criminal.

And when I was having car trouble, ""Just buy a new car already!"" Even though my financial situation isn't very secure because my job doesn't seem too secure right now. ""Just get a loan,"" they also suggested but I don't think that's a good idea for the same reasons.

So I'm in a kinda stressful place. I'm at work facing consequences for having told people I was being harassed, I'm trying to find a new job but it's not instant, and I don't really have anyone to fall back on financially. And it's really frustrating talking to my friends who will try to give me unsolicited ""easy answers"". 

I think some it of it is that they've had better experiences in life, they've worked at places that were better to employees, their family could afford a lawywr if needed, they have family to fall back on in the first place. They've never had a bad interaction with tbe cops that left them wary. Theyir family has  always had the money for car payment. So to them, the answers are easy. But to me, it sounds soo dismissive, like they think I'm too dumb to see the easy answers they see.

I've tried to tell them that I know what I need to do and I don't appreciate being talked to like there is some simple answer that I'm not smart enough to see, and they got really annoyed 

TLDR - my friends keep giving unsolicited advice and It's so frustrating"
"I[25M] can’t bear to watch my husband[49M] gamble anymore. Took my ring off and tossed it.


He had been away from gambling for almost 6 months. He decided to go on a cruise and wouldn’t go if I didn’t. I said alright, we’ll see some ground rules to make sure we don’t go overboard... well those rules went out the window the moment we got on the cruise. Regardless, we managed to have a good time - I accepted it as a vacation as why not let him have some fun. It’s not like I could have stopped it anyways.

When we got back, he constantly hinted at going up to the casino. I told him that we just got back, maybe next month would be better? He then planned a trip with his brothers and told me that he was discussing it in front of me in the kitchen, he assumed i’d be okay. That didn’t happen. I told him that I’m just beginning to feel better after being sick for the past 3 days and wanted to rest, if he wanted to go, he could go with his brothers. I just wanted to rest. But he said he wouldn’t go if I didn’t, and I knew how much his older brother wanted to go, he doesn’t go out much. 

So we set rules again, he’d only spent the amount we agreed on, a couple hundred. And stay for about 3 hours. I sucked it up and went. And surprise surprise, it was all just words. Meaningless words. After a while, he told me he’s going to bathroom and he went to take out a lot more money. We’re not even normal when it comes to money, we are barely making it every month. All our cards are maxed out because of the cruise. He managed to win a grand back and he promised he was not going to spend it. He was done. We went to find his brothers and while watching them finish up, he said he’s going to the bathroom. And was gone for 30min. Just a hunch I walked around and there he was... pressing the button. I took my ring off, threw it in the trash, and walked back to my brothers.

What hurts more he is that he didn’t care. He got the ring out and kept it and went back to gamble. Acted like that’s nothing.

My sick in bed, back to square one, and he doesn’t care. He got dressed for work and left. For the first time, I see how he truly values this marriage. Taking off the ring was the biggest thing I could have done. It was my last desperate plead with him to stop. To think about his family. 

What am I suppose to do? Just let him gamble all the money and then cry to me later on saying he fucked up? That already happened a few times. I try to be understanding and let him have some fun but he doesn’t know when it stop. Is this what partners are supposed to be like? Because it kinda sucks if it is. You don’t need to ask my permission but just communicate. Why do something that you know will hurt the people you love? Unless of course, you don’t really love them. What about lies? How does one justify that?

Maybe I’m just thinking too much. I don’t even know anymore. All I know is that I’m not doing this anymore. I need a break.

TL;DR : Husband is an addict and I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t care that it’s destroying our marriage. I don’t know what to do. Should I just let him be?"
"I [20s f] am very depressed, I'm worried about the effect it has on my partner [20s m]


Tldr; I have had depression for years and im worried it's affecting my relationship of 2 years

I have had depression and anxiety for a long time now. It comes from many areas in my life, including an awful childhood. My partner also suffers from anxiety and recently depression. Bc of this we are very good at understanding each other. But I'm worried it's taking a toll on him.
I've noticed him sighing more and looking tired whenever I mention my depression or bad thoughts. I know you shouldn't rely on a SO and I don't he asks me what's wrong. But as soon as I say he looks tired. Has anyone else bee through this? How do we both move past this?"
"I [M20] asked a girl [18F] out, she said yes, but isn't following up, is she not interested, or just afraid?


Some time ago, my brother in law asked this girl if she thought I was good looking, and she said yes. It was indirect, which feels like a more sincere complement that way. My brother in law then kind of was a middle man for a while, but nothing ever happened.

I started school again after a break, and we go to the same school now. She mentioned she saw me to my brother in law a the beginning of the semester. I got annoyed that I didn't have the balls to ask her or talk to her, partly because she's surrounded by friends, and because I suck at initiating.

Now I finally did ask her, kind of innocent to walk the dogs some time together. She could pick when and where, and responded that she'd love to do that, and would tell me, and that she didn't work alot in January. (I let her pick time, because Ive seen her at 2 different work places, so I assumed little free time).

I haven't heard from her in some weeks, we don't really say anything to each other at school (we're not in the same class, so it's limited). But I realize maybe it was a mistake asking her to pick time, and I should've just asked when she was free.

So, am I being too harsh, telling myself that she probably didn't get excited that I asked, or should I assume she's nervous and maybe ask her again, Im hesitant on asking, because I don't wanna come off as needy, or bothering her. I'm really new to all this stuff, so any sort of help is appreciated

TLDR; Asked a girl to get together and walk the dogs some time, she said I was handsome through a 3rd party which gave me the push to ask her, and now she doesn't give any signals back to me after some weeks passed, should I accept that it is a rejection? "
"I (23f) am getting ready to leave my job to be a SAHM, my parents (40’s m and f) have been very vocal about their disapproval and believe my husband (26m) is forcing me into it. Things got heated and we aren’t speaking, how to I salvage and smooth this over?


My husband and I have a 3 year old, and I’m currently 24 weeks pregnant with our second. We always planned for me to stay at home with our children, but I decided to take on a really nice job opportunity right before we found out I was pregnant with our first and decided to wait until I was pregnant with the second (my mom has provided the childcare). Now that the time has come, I am a month away from leaving my job and staying home permanently (at least until kids are in school). My husband has always been open about the fact that he wanted a SAHM for his children, and I’ve always been open about the same preference. We’re really excited about the new life transition, but my family is much less supportive. 

We were having dinner with my parents last week when my dad asked me when my last day at work was. My mom took this as an opportunity to let me know that she thinks I’m making a stupid decision to leave my job and that she is disappointed that my husband would let me “sacrifice my identity” and waste my education to “wait on him hand and foot”. My dad didn’t really bother to defend me, and just went on to tell me that I have so much potential, he just doesn’t want me to waste it on being “just a housewife” because he loves me. Despite all that being very insulting, I let it go for the sake of dinner. Things didn’t blow up until my mom pulled me aside in the kitchen and told me she had scheduled a tour with a daycare center and reached out to a friend of hers to get my oldest child on a waiting list without even consulting me. I obviously didn’t take that very well and asked her why, and she just reasserted that she didn’t raise me to sit on my ass all day and push out kids. She was heated, I was heated, things escalated to yelling and some offensive remarks about my husband and I haven’t spoken to either of my parents since we left. 


Don’t get me wrong, I understand *why* my mom is upset. My mother was always a very ambitious woman who spent a lot of my childhood out of the house. She was career driven by nature, so she wanted me to be the same. My dad worked full time as well, and I always knew I’d much prefer to be home with my children rather than send them to daycare centers and paying ridiculous amounts to do what I’d prefer to be doing myself. I never bothered to bring this up with my mom before I had kids though, mainly because I didn’t want her to feel bad or believe I thought she was a bad mom for being dedicated to her work. I really don’t think that, I just know I’m not that kind of person. My husband and I know this is the decision that’s best for us and our family, and we can afford it so there’s no reason for us not to. I really don’t want this to be a lasting wedge between my mother and I, mainly because it’s just so silly. This really has nothing to do with her, so why should it be worth straining your relationship with your daughter? Does anyone have any advice on how to handle parents who don’t approve of your lifestyle? I know that I can’t force her to like it, but I could use some guidance as to how to smooth this over and let it die down as soon as possible. 

Tl;dr: I’m pregnant and leaving my job next month to be a stay at home mother. My parents are very vocal about their lack of approval and I need to know how to smooth things over and placate so that I don’t have to stress over any of this. "

"Me (30m) and my gf (30f): she is very lazy and messy at home


We have been living together for a year now. 

She is an amazing woman and I adore her, but her laziness is unbelievable. 

We both work, I work more hours than she does. I like having a tidy apartment and most of the household duties are my responsibility, which I don’t mind. But there are days when I am ill or work overtime and I come home and she does literally nothing. 

All the laundry remains dirty until I do it, even if she has nothing to wear. She doesn’t even do the bed, dishes, puts away her dirty socks, anything. 
Her free time is spent at home playing video games or watching tv all the time. 

We can both cook, but I do it most of the time. She always says she would do it and then I get tired of waiting and simply do it myself.

What can I do about it, how to approach this subject? Her reply to me is always that I am nagging her and she always has an excuse why she did nothing. 

Tl;dr: Me (30m) and my gf (30f): she is very lazy and messy at home"
"I [21/f] don't want people to think I had sex with him [18/m], what should I do?


I've been having sex with this junior in high school. He's 18. I feel so weird about it because his friends are so immature and rude. His friends are all 16. They found the open condom wrapper with the used condom in it in his car. I want to deny it because lately he's been pissing me off. I don't want him to have the satisfaction of saying he's been having sex with me and how we've been going down on each other in his car. He makes me sick right now. He thinks he can get in my pants but he can't. I'm going to tell everyone we didn't really. 

I bet he'll be embarrassed when I'm around his friends and I say ""I would never have sex with you, you're too young for me."" He can't say anything to that, now can he? He deserves it for thinking he can just get in my pants anytime he wants. How should I go about denying it? 

Tl;dr: I don't want people to know I had sex with him"
"I (24F) haven't told my boyfriend (25M) everything about where and who I live with


So i've been with my boyfriend for about 8 months and my parents keep telling me that they want to meet him, especially since me and my boyfriend go out a lot and I live with my parents. 

The problem is that I live very close to my grandparents - they have another house but in the same yard (a few meters away from my parent's house). My grandpa is really mean (and a bit crazy to be honest) and my grandma is paralyzed so she is stuck in bed. My dad spoon feeds &amp; cares for my grandma.

The problem is I haven't told this to my boyfriend because i'm embarrassed about my family situation. When he picked me up with his car before we went out, I always told him to stop at about 2 minutes away so there is no chance of him meeting my grandpa or seeing their house.
He also really wants to meet my parents but I don't want him to be mad at me that I haven't told him everything. 

I really love him and I don't want him to be mad at me. How should I tell him?

Tl;dr my boyfriend doesn't know exactly where I live and that I live in the same yard as my grandparents. Don't know how to tell him this"
"My boyfriend [22M] of 2 years told me [21F] that he slept with a mutual friend of ours, 9 months after the fact. Am I doing this right?


Context- 

1. We're in a long distance relationship (currently 10/14 months), and before I left we talked about being physically intimate with other people since it's a long time apart and people have physical needs.

2. We agreed that we could eat get a shot at one person while we were apart.

3. We've never had any issues with lies or mistrust before. We both are serious about our relationship and have aligned goals about our future, etc.

Way back in summer, he and a bunch of our mutual friends were doing a contract job together. He started spending a lot of time with this one girl A, and I asked him a bit about her but didn't have any reason to suspect anything. A and I were acquaintances and afaik she was a nice girl. 

BF texted me one day saying that the night before, he and A had gotten drunk and cuddled up for a while, since they're both in LDR and missed their SOs, and thought they could pretend to be with them. I inquired a bit but he insisted it was only cuddling, and I believed him because I had no reason not to, as well as our deal. He said that encounter counted for his shot, and I just sort of forgot about it and we went on with our lives. A and him hung out a bunch afterwards, but that wasn't out of the ordinary as he hangs out with a lot of people one on one. He told me some things about her that raised some red flags, and I confronted him about what really happened back on that night, but he insisted nothing had happened beyond what he told me.

Fast forward to last week. BF called me like he usually does, but was sobbing and crying, saying that night he actually fucked her but he didn't know how to tell me. I haven't tried to hook up with anyone so far so he thought I wasn't serious about our deal. He said it really was weighing on him and has absolutely riddled him with guilt since it happened, and apologized profusely through tears and kept saying he loves me. He's visiting me this week (we planned this visit for months) and wanted to get this off his chest before visiting. He said this was the only thing he's ever lied to me about.

And I just...forgave him. I really feel like he's being genuine. The only other time he's cried in front of me is when a close family member suddenly died. I told him to never lie to me again and forgave him. To clarify I'm not mad at him for fucking A, I'm mad that he lied about it and hid it for so long. On the other hand, I'm kind of glad he told me now and not way back when because I'm in a much better mental state now than I was, and I would've reacted very very badly. 

Tl;Dr - Boyfriend fucked someone and lied about it for almost a year. Am I being stupid for forgiving him right off the bat?"

"Please Help: My wife walked out on me


Hi all!! 

So, here's my story, I hope someone else can relate to this situation I'm finding myself in, with any potential advise or suggestions welcomed.

A bit of a background regarding my relationship and myself:

We met in high school, 15 years ago, dated since then and got married 4 years ago. Overall the relationship has been great, and my wife a fantastic human being. Yes, we both do have our own issues, however, to be 100% honest, I have clearly not been the easiest person on earth to be with.

About myself... I've always, ever since I can remember, been that kid who got told to cheer up and smile, the one who never really felt included and overall relatively quite and reserved. This stigma followed me right up into my adulthood, however, progressively getting worse with each year that passed. I never really thought much of it, and kind of accepted the fact that a was a depro individual with no particular drive.

Only up until recent, as in a few weeks ago, I reached breaking point, a complete f*cking meltdown, and this ""constant sadness"" had gotten to a point where it's made me virtually useless at work, and ruined my personal relationships (plural), including my marriage. Against everything I believed (or am stubborn about), put my pride aside and went to see a Psychiatrist to perform an assessment of my completely undiagnosed and untreated self. Long story short, did a tone of questionnaires, assessments and test, and essentially ticked every f*cking box associated with adult ADHD and chronic clinical depression. 

As I touched on above, I have never, nor have my parents ever entertained the thought of ""what is actually wrong with me"", again, I'm extremely stubborn and would never have accepted such a diagnosis before. More than probably, I'd have cooked the relevant assessment and answer in the way that would reach the conclusion of me being fine, seeing as these assessments are so easy to get a feel for where it's going. 

This being said, I answered everything truthfully, and was completely honest with myself as well as about my feelings, as much as the thoughtof even saying this makes me still cringe (work in progress). 

Now, how this has affected my relationship........

Another long story short, but I myself had become a complete miserable  *sshole to say it lightly. Have zero drive to do sh*t, became distant, quite, and worst of all, unaffectionate. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, think she is super hot and attractive, but simply just could not explain the fact that I had like ZERO sex drive, or even the ability to show her I love her in an affectionate way.

She ended up becoming the ""instigator"" if I can call it that, always happy around me, trying to cheer me up, show her affection with me, etc. Now, being in this depressive slump, I'd not always reciprocate the love, as I felt way to f*cking depressed to even move, nevermind be intimate. This unfair move on my behalf, over the years, ended up coming across to my awesome wife (which I never realised), and forward track through the years, the woman I love had stopped trying with me completely, probably to show me what this shit feels like. 

Fast forward to present, we are both essentially simply just existing next to each other, hardly fighting, interacting... Just existing. I still love and feel exactly the same about this woman, but have essentially f*cked up the best thing in my life over a very long time. 

Then, last week, my wife simply had enough (and I cannot blame her), bought a one way airplane ticket back home to her folks, to reevaluate life and decide if she even wants to pursue this marriage. To date, I have not had any sort of reply to all my attempts to get her back, and I've really been f*cking trying here. 

So, in a nutshell, I blame myself 100% for f*cking shit up. My whole entire life I've always been this miserable depressed excuse of a person,  and quite surprised I actually managed to hold onto such an awesome person. In my own defense, I had no idea I'm actually living here with what appears to be some sort of chemical imbalance in my head, leading to a whole world of unsavory characteristics as explained to me by the doc, most of which I posses. Then again, I find it as such a cop out to blame my f*ck ups on a medical condition, and it's my fault I never got diagnosed sooner. 

Currently, I've been under regular treatment a week before she left, as well as the following week, going on as long as needed. I've accepted this diagnosis completely, and am actively trying my hardest to become a better person in all aspects of my life, most importantly, my pending marriage. 

This ""confession"" essentially only touches on my marriage, but extends to all aspects and relationships in my life, family, fiends, the works, which I may elaborate upon in a future edit. But for now, I can honestly say I know why I was the way I had been, and it kills me how I have hurt this loving person and want nothing more than to have her back. Currently, treatment seems to be giving me a much better outlook on life, and has decreased the depressive thoughts to an extent. I'm aware that psychiatry is not an exact science, and am open to the trial and error. All I want at the end of the day is to feel happy and content, I want to be able to have a ""drive"" in life (if that makes sense), and overall be the person my wife needs. 

Unfortunately, I may have blown it all, way to little too late I guess, and wish I came to this realization sooner. 


**TL;DR; : Due to my wife leaving me based on my actions described above, I need advise from an outsider on the topics below**.
 

1) has anyone at all been in a similar situation and managed to make it work? 

2) any advice on how I can approach my wife, what to say, etc? 

3) any advice on bettering myself as a person, that may have worked for you. 

Basically any sort of input would be awesome. 

Anyways, sorry for the long ass post, it's actually way less that I'm able to physically write down, but yeah, I'm so desperate here and feel trapped with now good way out. My wife is my life, and without her there no real reason to go on.

"My (22f) boyfriend’s (23m) friend (24f) is in love with him and ‘wondering why he hasn’t made his move on her yet’. Is he in love with her too?


We have been dating for a year now and he met her 10 months ago.

Until he (Matt) met her (Dasha) everything was great, it was an amazing beginning. Than he met her through some job project and they started hanging out. I usually have no problems with his female friends but:

They text all the time, they hang out all the time alone, mostly at her place.

One night at midnight Matt and I were at my place and she wrote him she had a headache and no painkillers. From Matt’s stories (bc he talks about her a lot) I knew she was great friends with her neighbor and I said couldn’t she ask him for a pill. But Matt immediately got up, got dressed and got going to her place to bring her meds. He didn’t even want to hear about anything else.

Once she invited him over ‘to get drunk’ on Saturday evening, only the two of them and I told him it bothered me but he still went, defending Dasha and saying that if I don’t trust him, that’s my problem.

I was few times invited for drinks with them but Dasha is treating me unfriendly so I stopped going. 

Dasha is in good relations with one Matt’s colleague that has always liked me a lot. This woman told me the last time I saw her that Dasha was talking about Matt a lot and also Dasha said she doesn’t understand why he hasn’t made his move on her yet. 

The colleague also told me that Matt is always very protective of Dasha, for example even when they walk on the street he is ‘defending’ her with his arms and body language from the other people and even gave her his hand when she was going down the stairs once.

I don’t know what to think. Sounds like he likes her too but then again I think he would really make his move on her if he did?

Edit: I accidentally did some mistakes in the previous post, got a message it has been removed and ended up deleting it. Sorry if anybody commented on it already, this is my first post ever and I am very confused still.

Tl;dr: My (22f) boyfriend’s (23m) friend (24f) is in love with him and ‘wondering why he hasn’t made his move on her yet’. Is he in love with her too or is it all her fault?"
"I need advice for a seven year relationship


So me (20F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for almost seven years. Which means I was 13 when we got together. As you could assume, he was the first and last person I have had sex with. Same goes for him.

We did have about a 2 month break at one point. During this time we both had sex with another person.

Our relationship for the most part is totally fine. We get along very well and have been looking into buying a house together. Our sex life however, is almost non-existent. We have sex twice a month maybe. I never have a desire to have sex with him, but he wants to all the time. Its not that i'm never horny, because I am horny often. Its just that i don't want him to fulfill my desires.

I also would like to note that he never compliments me in any way. I always have to tell him I love him first, he never tells me first. He also never kisses me first either. And this makes me feel very insecure..

I frequently have desires to talk to other people in a sexual way via text. I know that it is wrong of me to do such a thing as many would consider it to be cheating. But I don't know what to do.

I love this man with everything in me, but I need advice on what to do.

"Boyfriend (22M) didn’t include me (21F) on the plans we’d made together


My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years now. We also live together and have a strong connection. It’s almost Lunar New Year, so we traveled abroad to celebrate with his family. 

We’ve been here for nearly 2 weeks now, and I’ve spent each day with his family. I don’t tag along when he goes out with friends though, because he hasn’t seen them in a year so I’m giving him space. However, one of our mutual friends that lives here just got married. Unfortunately, we missed the wedding so I haven’t gotten to meet his wife yet. 

I asked my boyfriend to make plans with them, and 2 days ago he informed me of the plans. He said that we will go watch the World Cup together. But he told our friend that I don’t like soccer; it’s not true, he was using me as an excuse to not watch the game. So I offered up some other ideas for us to do. 

BF said the time was up in the air, but that plans might also change. He said it would be around the evening. I trusted what he said, so I didn’t text the friend or his wife. Well, as time went by he didn’t mention anything so I just assumed things were the same. Maybe that’s my fault. But then he said, “I’m going to the coffee shop with my [different] friend.” I asked, “what about our plans tonight?” And he basically told me not to worry. 

Hours past, and I heard nothing from my boyfriend. He finally texted me back and said he’s watching the game at a coffee shop. I asked, “with who?” And he said “didn’t i already tell you? With [mutual friend]” I was confused because he told me that he’d be hanging out with someone else and then hours later he texts me (not even call) to say that he’s carrying on the plans *without* me. I texted him once more and asked what happened to the original plan, why can’t I come. And he hasn’t responded to me. It’s been an hour since he last did. 

I’m extremely upset because I feel like it’s very rude to continue the plans without telling me when to come. Or to come at all. When he gets home, I don’t know how to talk to him about it. I don’t even know if I should be upset; or if I should’ve just let him enjoy time with his friends. But I feel like since he’s the one who told me about the plans, he should’ve at least had the decency to cancel on me. Any advice is welcomed. 

**TL;DR — Boyfriend and I came abroad to see his family and friends. He made plans with me, a mutual friend + their wife. He left to go do something with someone, then carried on the plans without me. He didn’t even cancel on me, he just went there and didn’t answer my texts. Now he won’t answer me after asking why he didn’t let me know. How should I approach this?**"

"Boyfriend (24M) wants to break up, over me (19F) not posting on Social Media


We have been together for over 3 years. Long distance for over 2 years. I graduated High School and moved to another country last June with my cat to live with him, leaving my family behind. 

We've had quite a few petty arguments in our relationship in the past, and although I did want to ask for help and advice on the internet before, I've been too shy about it and just kept it to myself, but at this point I'm fed up. I do not like to ask about relationship advice from my best friend as he is the best friend of my boyfriend as well, and I do not have any other friends that I am as close to.

I find social media (Instagram, Facebook to be exact) to be very distracting and draining on my mental health, so I use it as least as possible to stay happier and more productive. Every time I go back to it, I've always experienced a decline in my life and how I want it to go. I do not like posting anything on those platforms either because I know I get hooked on seeing how many likes my pictures and posts get and how its consuming my time.

My boyfriend on the other hand, likes to use Instagram and Facebook as he says it's a good way to stay up to date with friends and news, among other things (aka mindless clickbaity videos and articles that eat up your time, we all know them).

He has been very persistent on trying to make me be more active on Facebook and post pictures of myself on Instagram. He has admitted that he wants to show me off, but also says that he doesn't want to date someone who is ""anti social"".

We had an argument about it last night and I told him how I felt about social media, I've told him my feelings about this topic before. He said that he doesn't agree with me and doesn't want me to talk to him until I change my mind. Today when he came home from work, I apologized and told him that I still haven't changed my mind, he told me he's considering breaking up with me.

I don't understand him and I really don't know what to do next in this relationship.

TL;DR: Been together 3 years. Moved to another country to live with him. Always had petty arguments before. I don't like consuming social media (Facebook, Instagram). He likes showing me off so he's trying to convince me to post pictures of myself on Instagram and be active on Facebook. I didn't change my mind. He calls me ""anti social"" and is now considering breaking up. Need advice on what to do with the relationship."
"How do I get better at listening?


I (22M) love my wife (24F) without question. Nothing compares to how important she is to me. I really feel like I found my soulmate early on and I’m so grateful for that. But all relationships have their problems and I’m facing one now and I’m asking for help. 


We’ve had numerous of fights now when she tells me that I don’t listen to her. Of course it makes me sad because I value her feels more than anything else. But it’s not uncommon to be unaware of your own behavior and I’m realizing that I need to do something about this.


Most of our fights has to do with stress. My wife is going through a lot. I won’t go too much into detail but she has to take medication every day. She recently started a new job too. The problem arises when I express concern about other issues. I get anxiety because I feel like it has to be addressed. I proceed to tell her what I’m feeling, but it only leads to more stress. She gets angry and that’s when she tells me that I don’t listen to her. Sometimes she throws me out of the room. 


It makes me feel very bad. I get a strong desire to fix things but nothing seams to work. I text her saying I didn’t mean to stress her out, but it’s usually not enough. I start to feel hopeless and something tells me that I’m not meeting her needs. She’s told me that I push her too far and that I need to listen to her. 


I want her to feel like she can tell me anything. I want her to share more about what she’s feeling so that I don’t have to make mistakes and stress her out. Am I pushing her too far because I forget what she really needs? I want to get better at listening so that I don’t forget. I don’t want to stress her out and constantly make the same mistakes. Tell me what you think I should do because I really love her and I don’t want to keep this going. 


Tl;dr: I’m my wife’s stressful life more stressful. I don’t seam to understand her needs. I want to get better at listening so that I don’t make the same mistake all the time. How do I remember to back off when I rub her the wrong way?

"Ex is having my baby and doesn't want anything to do with me but I still love her


Title sums up the gist of it. I don't know what to do. We had issues in the relationship because I've got trust issues from being cheated on in the past. A lot. Literally, I've had 2 therapists tell me I have PTSD from it. Anyway, I found out she was talking to an ex-fwb behind my back (and I think it really was harmless, I don't think she was actually attempting to cheat) and then lied to me about it so I lost it and said mean and cruel things that I shouldn't have. And when I was tossing her stuff out the door, I accidently hit her hand with one of the objects (I FEEL AWFUL about it. I've never intentionally hurt another human being. I have so much shame and regret over it. I just wasn't looking or thinking what I was doing.) It was basically a blind rage. She was done. And so I was I. In that moment, anyway. I was hurt and angry, but still loved her. Still, we broke each other's trust one way or another and it was over. Then I find out she is pregnant (it's definitely mine) and we consider a reconciliation may be possible in the future but we agree to start earning each other's trust back. Literally the next time she came over, I caught her in another lie. I didn't get angry this time. I just went to get my coat to take her home because I knew no good would come from the situation at that point and I wasn't even angry, just really sad and hurt. She stormed off, wouldnt let me drive her home and blocked me on all her social media. And I was the wronged party and still I was treated like a villain. Hell, all her family and friends hate me. She has since been somewhat civil through a couple text messages, but I can tell she hates me and it kills me. I do still love and care for her, despite everything, and if we're going to have a child together, I'd rather we at least try to make something work than give up before the kid is even born. I don't know what to do. I don't have family. I barely have friends these days because everyone is off with their own families and lives. I'm heartbroken from missing her and over the pregnancy. "

"My [27F] boyfriend [25M] of 2 years keeps drinking with our female neighbor. Not sure what to do.


My (27F) boyfriend (25M) and I moved in to an apartment together 3 months ago. We have 4 single neighbors surrounding us, 3 men and 1 woman. They are always outside, smoking and/or drinking. I don't smoke and drink rarely, but my boyfriend likes doing both. He usually does it solo, as he is a self proclaimed ""loner"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago I woke up at 2:00 am and my boyfriend wasn't in bed. I checked the apartment, and looked outside but couldn't find him. I figured he must've gone on a walk or something, so I went back to bed. At 4:30 am he wakes me up and tells me he just spent the last 4 hours with our female neighbor. He tells me he was outside and she offered him beer, and he lost track of time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend claims to love being alone, and gets major social anxiety, so him speaking to a complete stranger for so long was odd to me. I was pretty irritated that he was up with another girl drinking and talking for hours, but I was happy he had a friend/someone to drink and smoke with. My main concern is that he was able to talk to this girl for hours upon hours (although in a drunken state), and he barely can hold a 5 minute conversation with me. I let him know that it concerned me a little, and that I'd appreciate if he could hang out with multiple neighbors if he wanted to drink/smoke, not just the female one alone. He didn't see the big deal and couldn't understand where I was coming from, but he agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, he's hung out with the group of neighbors once, and the female neighbor (alone) two more times. Every time he is gone for 5+ hours. The first couple of times, he left as I was getting into bed. Now, within 20 minutes of getting home from work, he is going outside to be with them. He seems restless and ready to get outside with them ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do as I have brought up my feelings a few times, and he doesn't understand. I am so happy he has friends and is able to be social, but I feel very pushed to the side and lonely. I was excited for him to get home from work each day, but now I just prepare to be alone. I don't want to end the relationship over this, but I'm not sure what options I have if he isn't willing to work on it with me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it. I feel really lost and don't know how to handle this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

Hi guys, I need your help. I got my friend a Christmas gift back in December that I haven’t given her yet and now I’m not sure I should.

"Dealing with depressed partner


I am in a relationship with someone who unloads their emotions on me sporadically. When things are good, they're great and I'm the happiest person alive, but when my partner is down for personal reasons, things take a horrible turn. 
I am afraid of depression. My father was depressed and as a result my parents had a loveless marriage. I want to be supportive but how can I show support and empathy when my partner constantly puts me down when they're down - from comparing me to other people to telling me I am selfish and overly dramatic for reacting to a disrespectful comment they have made. What if this treatment manifests into physical abuse or alcoholism?
When my partner is down, they don't realize that it is impacting our relationship and me as a result. Although my partner gives me reassurance that their mood is not a result of anything I am doing, the toxicity seeps it's way through. I have been stressed for months as a result and I am not happy. How can I navigate around this? I am trying my hardest to be supportive but keep getting shut out by their negative remarks. I am afraid this relationship is on life support because it's not sustainable. How will I deal with this roller coaster of emotions and  instability when we get married? I'm at a point where I am second guessing my text responses or the words I speak, and finding distractions because my relationship is a huge weight on my chest. I feel sick to my stomach and scared because what if this is a repeat of my parents relationship?

We have been together for 3 years. 5 months ago this behavior has surfaced. We are talking about marriage.

Tl;dr - should I end a relationship with someone who is depressed because I have this overwhelming fear my parents story is about to repeat itself? Should I speak to a therapist on how to deal with depressed individuals? I want to be there by all means but I am having a hard time dealing with disrespect and boundaries being crossed."

I reminded him that I wasn’t and told him that he was the last one to play it and don’t blame me for his mistakes. He got really mad and smashed the tv I was watching which was about 5 feet away where I was sitting in bed off the shelf onto the floor and told me to get my stuff and that we were leaving, so I did. Now we’re in the car and he has apologized. This time he’s not driving crazy but if I were to say anything about his behavior he would start driving dangerously like he has done in the past. I don’t know if this is really abuse but it makes me feel really scared and unsafe. I don’t mind the behaviors I guess I just don’t want it to turn to anything more dangerous like him hitting me. Does anyone who has experience with this type of thing think that it could turn into a dangerous situation?

I feel butterflies in my stomach whenever I talk to him. We first met at the local chess club last month, I played chess with him and it was fun, I still do. He’s single and living alone, he’s a mechanical engineer, I have to admit that he’s good-looking, I asked him why he’s single and he said that he’s so focused on work and don’t have a time to meet people. He’s very kind to me, helped me with my math homework and he’s there for me, sometimes he would pick me up from school. I don’t know how he feels about me, maybe for him I’m just a daughter, or a younger sister, or just a friend. We’re gonna meet this Saturday to play chess, I want to confess to him. 

14 years gap is crazy and mom is just 5 years older than him. I probably met him at the wrong timeline and I’m so sad thinking about it. I cried last night, he’s the first person that I genuinely like. He’s like the man of my dreams, if he was the same age as I am, it won’t be a problem. Is it worth it?

"Teacher Intern with a Crush on Fellow Teacher


I've yet to write a post on Reddit, so here's my first one. I'm a secondary education major in Uni. I'm completing my final internship at a high school with roughly 400 hours of in-class experiences before I graduate. I'm gonna be here until late April. 

But to get to the heart of this post (no pun intended), I've developed a strong crush on one of my fellow teachers at this school. He's not involved in my chain of command (or even my subject level) and he's not the teacher I intern for. But he's the sponsor of the club I volunteer for. (I won't state the kind of club, *but it's a nerdy one that we're both into.*)

Based on my experience, he's been a pleasure to work with. Our mutual interests, how handsome he is to me, and how fun his personality is definitely contributed to this crush. (And it's not exactly relevant, but based on his appearance, he's at least 10+ years older than me.) 

I don't plan to work for this school, in fact, my plan is to continue my education next fall and start my master's degree. So, I don't have to worry about working in this community. But at the same time, I know my feelings are extremely taboo since this is a work environment. **(Just to clarify- I do not have feelings for the teacher I'm interning for. I have a developing crush on another teacher that works at the school.)**

How should I approach this? Is it normal for an intern to have feelings for a superior? I can't exactly talk about this with my peers. I'm hoping to get some input on this situation from a third party. Thanks!"

I always appreciate it, but haven’t ever said it, with actions yes...and several drunken I like you a lot and random kisses and overly long hugs. I’ve never explicitly told her that I’m okay with her being poly, but she came out to me in anweird way when we were having dinner...just blurted it out.

I’ve even asked her out, like do you want it go out for dinner and a movie and she‘ll always say yes, but we haven’t made out or slept together.  the only way to move things forward is to ask her, right? She’s pushed the relationship forward by making things more intimate, But he real communication isn’t there. She never pulls away just giggles.  I’ve apologized but she always says don’t. Do i just need to go all in? 

TL;DR: it’s definitely not a typical friendship, but I don’t really know if she wants more. We keep going further and further, and becoming larger parts of each other’s lives.  I know that relationships are no longer black and white.  But we need talk, right.  Things just feel weird like we’re both walking on eggshells...one of us will take a chance, and then ???"
"[26m] my luck with women.


I (26m), probably have the worst luck with women. Every girl I have slept with in the past years has either had a bf with out my knowledge (found out later) or has simply not cared they are cheating on there bfs and have told me upfront. 

Never made it official with any of them (even though they insisted at times) 1 (22f) even told me she broke up with her bf of a few years to be with me, which really shocked me when she told me because at that point we only had sex a hand full of times and only knew each other due to working together. 

Even tomorrow I’m going on a date with a girl [25f] I knew years ago and from what I’ve heard (really creditable source)she has a bf she’s living with. 

 I use to think it was a good thing that only women that are in a relationship are attracted to me (not having to deal with the whole “relationship” problems) but I’m starting to think it’s just bad luck and I’m starting to feel guilty for being that guy.

So I’m hear to ask for advice,
Should I or should I not go on this date tomorrow, even tho it’s been 6 months with out getting laid.

TL;DR asking for advice on cheating women trying to date me."

"Teacher Intern with a Crush on Fellow Teacher


I've yet to write a post on Reddit, so here's my first one. I'm a secondary education major in Uni. I'm completing my final internship at a high school with roughly 400 hours of in-class experiences before I graduate. I'm gonna be here until late April.

But to get to the heart of this post (no pun intended), I've developed a strong crush on one of my fellow teachers at this school. He's not involved in my chain of command (or even my subject level) and he's not the teacher I intern for. But he's the sponsor of the club I volunteer for. (I won't state the kind of club, *but it's a nerdy one that we're both into.*)

Based on my experience, he's been a pleasure to work with. Our mutual interests, how handsome he is to me, and how fun his personality is definitely contributed to this crush. (And it's not exactly relevant, but based on his appearance, he's at least 10+ years older than me.)

I don't plan to work for this school, in fact, my plan is to continue my education next fall and start my master's degree. So, I don't have to worry about working in this community. But at the same time, I know my feelings are extremely taboo since this is a work environment. **(Just to clarify- I do not have feelings for the teacher I'm interning for. I have a developing crush on another teacher that works at the school.)**

How should I approach this? Is it normal for an intern to have feelings for someone in their work environment? I can't exactly talk about this with my peers. I'm hoping to get some input on this situation from a third party. Thanks!

**TL;DR; I'm an intern with feelings for another teacher, not the one I work under. What should I do in this situation?**"
"Giving Effort


This is my first real relationship [21M] with my girlfriend [21F]. My relationship with her is her third real relationship.

She tells me to give and show more effort in the relationship but I really lack common sense and how to be a better boyfriend as I feel that I am inexperienced. I really do love you and she was in love and fell out of love (but still loves me, if that makes sense) and trying to be in love again. The main reason I pushed her to fall out of love was the lack of effort that I put in. I do admit that I was becoming comfortable and lazy and I really do want to give more effort and make her the happiest girl ever. We have been dating a little over 3 years.

I wanted to know from guys and gals with experience what they believe is giving/showing effort. I try to take her out, take her out on dates, and be more assertive of where to take her and so far it seems better. She would usually decide what to do but I now realize it was because I never put the effort to create date nights.

TL;DR i want advice on how to show your girlfriend that you are giving and showing effort towards the relationship. What did you do to show effort? Gestures?

"Should I [22M] stay or should I go? At decision point with [22F]


Apologizing in advance for formatting (mobile user)... Users of reddit, I need serious advice from a non biased perspective. 

I 22M started seeing 22F nearly a year ago, and everything is perfect. She is the kind of woman I see myself married to, and honestly what I consider the whole package to be. In order to make our relationship work we did distance for several months while I was on foreign work assignment, and she attended college about 7 hours from where we were both centrally located.  

We both fell hard, aka drive 15 hours in a weekend to see eachother hard. Maybe it was irrational at the time but we were very much enjoying eachother despite the distance and cost of visiting one another. She has accepted a contract to work in our city, which I generally do not like (dislikes climate, people, quality of life, taxes, etc). My obligation to stay here is over in roughly 6 months and I had planned to attend college for the last 3 years in a city that I would but much happier living in. 

Having an opportunity to go to college for free (because of my job and savings on my end)  and in an area that I would much prefer has been my goal for years. I know I prefer school on a physical campus, and there isn't an option for my major in the local area if I was to stay. 

Now, here is where it gets sticky. 

I could stay here, and we both take high paying jobs in a similar industry paying about 70k each (in a high tax area). We stay together, as she is everything I want in a woman i intend to marry, and we marry in the next 2-3 years. We spend the next 4 years here even though I'm not very happy because the climate and location doesn't allow some of my hobbies without driving 1+ hour. Then after her contract is up we could explore other options. 


So my question is, should I give up on my old goal (college, exploring new living situations, more time to travel, career goals with age requirements) for what my future could be with her if we stay here? Am I too young to give up on exploring more options at 22?

"My (24F) boyfriend (26M) cheated emotionally a year ago. We got past it, but today I saw her and all the feelings came back. Is there anything I can do?


So about a year ago I found out my boyfriend had been texting this girl gym pictures (not nudes just shirtless), telling her about his day, asking her for advice, fishing for compliments, using hearts in texts, finding any reason to talk to her, taking on the term “work husband”... it wasn’t outright cheating but it was verrrrry comfortable, too comfortable. I don’t know if it makes sense but I was furious when I found out. It may not seem like a huge deal but our relationship was almost perfect and I have had issues with trust in the past (he knows this). He said he didn’t realise he was crossing a boundary until I found out and he snapped out of it and realised he would hate it if I did the same thing. He apologised. 

He did everything he could to make it up to me, unlocking his phone, offered to never see her again, buying me gifts, giving me his computer password... and I tried really hard to build the relationship back. But I start relationships with 100% trust and the crack was there. The last couple of months have been fine though.

However today I saw her and despite all the work I’ve put in, I was still so salty about what happened. I put it behind me but when I saw her all the feelings came rushing back.

Is the trust actually gone? Our relationship is otherwise ideal. Is there anything I can do?

Tldr; bf emotionally cheated a year ago, I forgave him, then I saw her and got mad again"
