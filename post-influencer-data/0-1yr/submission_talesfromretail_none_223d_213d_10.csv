"No, I actually do work here.


TL;DR at bottom. 

So I am an optician at a doctor's office. Today our first scheduled appointment starts at 12:45 PM so I decide to take my lunch early to be here for the majority of the patients when they come. I get back from my lunch and right outside the door is standing an old lady (let's call her OL). I hold the door open and ask, ""Did you need some help?"" 

OL: Well, I have an appointment but they said the doctor's not in yet. 

Me: Yeah but you can still come in and sit down in our waiting room, it's much warmer in there. 

OL: Well they told me I had to wait. 

Me: Okay whatever's more comfortable for you!

I walk in and raise my eyebrow at the front desk girls and they shrug at me. I didn't know what was going on so I just went to my desk and sat down. Suddenly OL barges through the door.

OL: This is ridiculous. Why do you get to come in and sit down? 

Me: I'm sorry, you're welcome to come and take a seat over there? \*Pointing at the rows of empty seats in the waiting area.\*  
OL: They told me to wait! Why don't you have to wait?

Me: I work here, ma'am, I am the optician. 

OL: You should have to wait too! This is ridiculous!

Me: Ma'am did they tell you that you had to wait outside for some reason?

OL: No! But they are making me wait for my appointment. You don't get to just cut in line! 

Me: Well I don't have an appointment, I work here. 

OL: Oh so a walk-in gets service faster than me??

Me: \*pointing at my badge and table name tag\* Ma'am, I am not a walk-in, I do not have an appointment, I work here. You can wait for your appointment time inside, that's not a problem. 

OL: This is unfair treatment! You are sitting there at a computer without waiting!

Me: Ma'am, this is my desk. This is my computer. This is where I sit all day so I can help people who need glasses. If you get a new prescription today, I'll be your last stop before you leave today. 

OL: Whatever, this is ridiculous! 

The front desk girl comes up and tries to tell her the same thing but she just keeps complaining that I walked in and didn't have to wait. I ended up just tuning her out until they finally convinced her that she is keeping her appointment time and the doctor will call her in before me. She then sits down **at my desk** (the customer side) with a smug look. 

Me: Did you need some help? 

OL: No, if you get to sit here, I do too! 

Me: Okay sure. 

OL: That wasn't so hard was it??

Luckily there's no one else here right now. I am typing this right in front of her as she throws me glares and smug looks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what she wants, but she can't see my screen. Her appointment is at 1 PM. It's currently 12:12. Send help. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Lady is convinced I don't work where I work. Throws a fit then sits at my desk as if she was a customer. "
"I HAVE TO TYPE IT IN LADY


Cashier at chain supermarket, ect ect.

I was at self check out and had a lady and her son at one of the registers. Calls me over because her \[redacted\] card won't swipe. ""That's ok, I can suspend the order and take it over to the main register and type it in."" She forgot the card in her car so I wait for her to come back. When she does I pull up her order and ask for her card, this is where things get uh, something. This isn't verbatim because my memory is awful, but you'll get the gist and my god it was actually this repetitive. Me = me, C = customer.

&amp;#x200B;

C: What?

Me: I need your card so I can type it in.

C: I type it in manually at other stores all the time.

Me: We don't do that here.

C: I do it at other stores all the time.

Me: Ok, go ahead.

C: It says swipe or insert card.

Me: Because I have to type it in.

C: What?

Me: I have to type it in.

(we go back and forth like this 4 times jfc)

Me: I don't know how else to say it, but I have to type it in.

C: I can type it in manually on the self check out registers.

Me: I'm not sure how to do that, but maybe.

C: So you need to type it in?

Me: Yes.

C: I can do it on the self check out but not here?

Me: Yes.

C: That don't make no sense.

Me: \*retail smile\* I didn't make the machines, ma'am.

C: \*looks at her son\* come on

Then she proceeds to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I just. What. When my manager asked about where the cart came from I told her my customer was an idiot, which she didn't like. I'll need to work on using retail language."
"Chatty customer wasted half of my break for astronomy


In a previous post I established i work at a small local hardware store. Yesterday was a pretty slow day, and a lot of my customers were using that as a chance to chat about projects and things like that, happens all the time. 

But yesterday I missed lunch, and when i was sent out on break I was terribly hungry, so I used part of my ten minutes to buy food at the closest convenience store. As I’m walking back to eat in the breakroom, I got stopped by one of the same chatty customers, who was standing outside of my store, almost waiting for me. 

Except this time he wanted to talk about National weather (US) and about the chinese new year. 

Chatty customer: do you know what year we’re on in the Chinese New Year?

Me, naive enough to think it’s common knowledge, purely because i play Pokémon Go: It’s the year of the pig. 

CC: you’re right!

The following five minutes were wasted listening to him tell me about a woman who overlapped greek astrology and the astronomy behind Chinese New Year to make a “comprehensive personality analysis”.  I would inch back, and he’d follow, I’d try to excuse myself and he’d keep talking. I finally got free, and i had time to run into the store, use the restroom, and run to make it back on shift in time. 

My coworkers were cool about it and understood why I was so annoyed with him, and even let me lightly snack on shift, which normally isn’t allowed, to make up for essentially missing my chance to eat. "
