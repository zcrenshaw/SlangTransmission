"UPDATE: I (30F) am house hunting with my boyfriend (34M) and budget is causing friction.


Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c650wm/i\_30f\_am\_house\_hunting\_with\_my\_boyfriend\_34m\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c650wm/i_30f_am_house_hunting_with_my_boyfriend_34m_and/) 

Not a super popular post but I like updates so here we go!

None of the advice really addressed the actual question in terms of how to find a compromise on the issue. For the people saying paying 15k more wasn't that big a deal, it really was. Again it was our **max,** we had a range we were comfortable with and max meant absolute maximum if we couldn't find anything we liked for less.

Some people commented saying we needed to get pre-approved, so we did. All went fine there, the financial advisor was right on the money with what to expect. I wasn't particularly concerned because we both have limited debts, and great credit scores but even despite that I told him I wanted to get it done so we had a solid number to go by. 

In terms of not buying a house... guys we're gonna buy a house. I wasn't asking advice on whether we should buy a house or not. It's gonna happen. I get that people split and then you need to sort out a house between them, I've watched it happen with friends, and I've also seen people divorce and need to split a house too. I've gotta live somewhere and I'd rather be paying into something that's building equity than just paying rent. If the boyfriend and I split we'll just figure things out like the grown adults we are. 

**Anyway!** On to what actually happened.

Chatted with the boyfriend after I posted this, we got in another argument over the same house. I finally said to him that I don't argue with him when he says no to viewing a place I like for *any* reason because I respect his thoughts and opinion on the house we're buying together and if he isn't sold on a house for *any* reason it's a no from me too, so the fact he was fighting *so much* for a house I'd said no to due to it being out of our mutually agreed upon budget made me feel as though he did not respect my opinion. He kind of stopped and asked if I really felt as though he didn't respect me due to the situation, I said yes, he apologised and said he wouldn't bring up the house again.

He didn't bring up the house again. Further he was far more cognizant about not looking at houses outside our budget.

Yesterday morning we found a *perfect* house that was 40k under our max budget and had our offer accepted yesterday evening. We're doing a 2nd showing today, the inspection next week and if all goes well we'll be moving in the beginning of October!

**TL;DR:** Talked to boyfriend, told him the situation made me feel as though he didn't respect my opinion. He apologised and dropped it. We went on to find an absolutely perfect house we're both super excited about for 40k under our max budget."
"My birth parents (60s?m, 60s f) who bailed on me (30sf) are flaunting my success around town. How do I get these fools to shut their traps without bringing attention to it or sounding like a drama queen?


Hi, my brother (a year older) and myself were products of an affair. They wanted my brother. 

My father stayed married and my mother took off with my brother leaving me with friends as a toddler. She says it was because I was ugly. Father informed but not interested when I went into foster care and I stayed there until I found out who they were at 18. I've read the court papers as to my foster care.  They just didn't want me. My childhood was horrific. My father maintained contact with my mother and brother. 

I have always lived 30 minutes away at most from my birth parents in the same area. 

My grandmother was coincidentally my neighbour. She found out who I was through gossip and would send photos of me growing to my birth parents as a joke. She knew about the abuse and did nothing. She's dead. 

I left 'home' at 17 was homeless and have done everything myself. My full and half siblings from both sides have been well looked after by my parents. 

At 18+ I reached out to them and my father was remarried and made plans to see me repeatedly he never showed up for. He said it would upset his new family.  My mother had a lot more children and had forgotten about me really. I contacted them when I had my son and that was it and I heard nothing back.  

UNTIL. I've been in the media a fair bit and my friends have told me that my parents have been bragging about me and taking credit for how I look and my successes.  My mother's side of the story is now that I was cruelly ripped from her breast and forced into foster care. She compares herself to the irish homes of unwed mothers and forced adoptions. Oh WOE IS HER. My father is now an example of the injustice of the court system against fathers and how this is just further proof!  Oh WOE IS HIM. 

They talk about how I look like so and so and that I wouldn't be here without them. That my nieces and nephews Ive never met are 'just like me' and how I should give them the same opportunities I have had in my career. How that's what we do for 'family'. How I need to 'grow up' and get past it. 

I blocked contact after they wanted things, but this nonsense spreads easily and I am sick of being whispered about.  I don't want anything off them, I want to be left alone. They want me to meet their other grandkids at parties and they've apologised for the govt/family/god possibly/ the great spaghetti monster keeping us apart.

If I contact them it is further fuel for the fire. If I don't stand up for myself I look heartless and cruel. 

I don't want to leave just yet as my son is finishing school soon, I just want them to stop. 

Any advice?"
"My [17M] rich girlfriend’s [19F] family invited me to go on a vacation with them, but I don’t think I fit in.


I’m not trying to be rude at all or anything, I just don’t want to be a burden or anything. My girlfriend [19F] and I [17M] have been dating for a year now, and things are super great. She comes from a very wealhty family, while I come from a really poor family (not as poor anymore). She lives in a 2 million dollar home, her family drives new cars, and she is just wealthy, but she is not a person who feels in entitled because of her family’s wealth.

I’m also Latino and her family is American/White (sorry if that’s rude I don’t mean it in a rude manner). I do get along with her dad and her mom very well and they helped me with getting in a good university since my family couldn’t really help since I am the first to finish high school. I am respectful towards them and all and since I work in construction and landscaping, I do some work around their house. 

Her mom and dad invited me over for dinner and they told me they wanted me to come along with them and my girlfriend on a resort vacation lasting a week. It sounds nice and they said they had paid for me to go with them, but I feel real bad about it. Like, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go, but I saved a few hundred dollars from the past weeks of work. I do have some money to buy stuff over there, but I just feel bad and kind of emberassed that they are the ones paying for me to go. What should I do? Not go? Go with them? Apologize ? Or what?

TL;DR My girlfriend’s rich family is pyingn for me to go on a vacation with them, but I feel like a burden about it."
"My Partner (M31) Locked Me (F26) Out


TLDR: I go out for the night and boyfriend locks the door when I'm not home, bolting it so I can't get in. 

My boyfriend and I have been doing long distance while I am in school. I have come back for the summer and arrived a few days ago. Last night, I had agreed to meet a friend late because her family is in town and they are leaving tomorrow. I really wanted to meet them and my boyfriend was invited. He needed to be in bed early for work. Before I leave we start having a difficult discussion about how long distance has impacted us, how we should continue the relationship going forward, etc. Before going out, my boyfriend said, ""please don't drink too much so we can continue our conversation when you get back."" We didn't agree on a time I should be home to do so. Last night I left just before 10, had to wait because my friend and her family were lost, etc. Long story short, I text him at one letting him know I was in a cab on my way home. He told me not to bother and that he'd bolted the door. That I could sleep somewhere else and return for my stuff tomorrow. 

I was shocked. His last text was sent when I arrived to the apartment. I told him he wasn't asleep so he could let me in, went upstairs, and my keys couldn't get past the second lock because of the bolt. I call him twice and he denies the call. As I am heading downstairs, I hear him relock the first lock. I try to unlock it again, nada. Just as I am going downstairs to find a friend to stay with he opens the door. He lets me in, tells me I am treating the apartment (that we lived in together for a year and a half) like a hotel. That I am not welcome, and that he doesn't want to talk. He hands me a pillow. I ask him if I should sleep on the couch or leave. He says he doesn't care. 

I crashed on the couch and felt completely destroyed. My friend was angry that he had locked me out. This morning he got ready and didn't say a word to me. We have agreed to talk after work. I really don't know if this is the end. Was I in the wrong for going to meet my friend and her family? Is this fixable or is he bing abusive and I should book a flight back to where I came from?"
"I [19M] am considering breaking up with my [18F] girlfriend of over a year and a half because I’ve fallen out of love and have feelings for someone else. How can I approach this in the least hurtful and harmful way possible?


Before I start, I realize right off the bat that a) I’m not at all the good guy in this situation, b) there is no way in which this WON’T hurt her, and c) I don’t expect her to still like me or want to be friends with me. I just want to figure out how to do this in a way where she gets hurt the least, because she doesn’t deserve that

TL;DR at the bottom

I met my gf when we were both sophomores, and we started dating our junior year. We recently graduated. For the first year and several months, things were amazing and we felt in love. I was naïve. I know that highschool relationships rarely last

About 3 and a half months ago, my gf started having second thoughts about our relationship, and began to close herself off and distance herself from me. This was a very difficult time for me, as I am a very affectionate person and I need that in a relationship. Over time, without realizing, I began to fantasize and crush on other people, specifically someone that I became friends with at the end of my junior year

Now, a month into summer, I realize that I have really fallen for this new girl, and no longer feel the same about my gf. About a week ago I had a serious talk about how things need to change in our relationship if it is to continue, and my gf understood, apologizing for how she’d acted and the things she’d done (the specifics of what she did aren’t important here - only that it was toxic behavior and she’s apologized profusely)

The first two or so days afterwards, things were great, but after that I noticed that she had already started moving backwards into old behaviors. My patience is thin and my entire friend group agrees that I should break up with her. Last night, my gf came over, and I didn’t enjoy myself near as much as I used to. I simply didn’t have fun. To me, this is the nail in the coffin. I plan on breaking up with her next week, if not this one

All that being said, I truly believe that she’s not a bad person. She’s just done things that I can’t get over, and continues to do some of them. We’re both young and have plenty of time to grow and develop and mature. We simply weren’t ready for a serious relationship. She doesn’t deserve to be hurt, so I just wanna know how I can break things off in the least hurtful way possible

TL;DR - I’ve fallen for another girl after my gf closed herself off from me for months. Despite promises to change, my gf seems to be the same, so I want to end things. How can I do this without hurting her too much?"
"My (26F) boyfriend (27M) left me because he had feelings for someone at work - and now wants to come back.


My boyfriend of 7 years left me a fortnight ago because he had feelings for someone at work. 

For a few months before that I thought something was up - he'd been really nit-picky with me and seemed unhappy with a lot of my habits. He told me I'd be going to the gym too much, was too fussy about the cleaning, fell asleep too early and was too focused on making dinner as soon as I got home. I was kinda cut up about it, but was broadly trying to be better, making more time for us, putting my phone down etc. I thought that I was just too busy and not appreciative enough of him. 

Then a few weeks ago I saw him out with some girls from work and my gut just knew. I told him the day after that if he was falling out of love with me and falling in love with someone else that he should just make himself happy. 

He told me he wasn't in love with her but he did have feelings for her and he didn't know where his head was. So he left, I asked him to take a few days and to think about what he wanted and that maybe we could work things out. He told me he hadn't been able to work out what he wanted for months and so he didn't think a few days would help. He left and we kinda left it there. 

I was in bits and kept calling and texting asking him to come home but his phone was off. 

I found out on Sunday he'd gone straight to hers and slept with her and so I told him it was over. 

Since then he's been begging to come back. He says he got commitment-phobic and acted out because things were less than perfect between us. But he wants to come back because less than perfect with me is better than being with anyone else. 

I know I shouldn't take him back. He's broken my trust, made me feel like I wasn't good enough and paid zero respect to the 7 years of love I've given him. But I can't turn 7 years of love off that fast and want him home. 

TLDR: boyfriend of 7 years left because things were ""not perfect"" and he had feelings for someone else, slept with her and now wants to come home."
"I [30sF] asked my former boss/mentor [40sM] if I could use him as a reference for my dream job; he turned the call into an interview for himself. Should I call him out?


Background...my former boss, Jake, from 6 years ago and I have worked together at 2 different companies. I consider him a mentor and have learned a ton from him. As we've gone our separate ways, we've stayed in touch. He sends me freelance gigs or recommendations, and I do the same for him in my new role. Recently, I hired him to do $20k worth of projects over the course of 2 months. 

Anyway, my dream job fell into my lap a few weeks ago and I asked Jake if I could use him as a reference. He said of course. (I have used him in the past as a reference as well) After the hiring manager contacted him, Jake texted me telling me it sounds like a great opportunity and I'd be awesome for it. 

Well, I met with the hiring manager today and got offered the job. As we were talking, he mentioned that my references gave glowing reviews of me, then laughed and told me that one of them (Jake) ""must have mistaken the call for his own interview."" He said Jake spent the call trying to sell himself and his experience as a creative director in the industry on my new boss and called out his availability to work as a freelancer. I could tell my new boss thought it was completely tasteless, and I was mortified. 

Should I say something to Jake? On the one hand, I did get the job, but at the same time, he could have sold my new boss on himself for the role (and for all I know, tried to). At the very least, it wasn't the time to promote himself. I'm quite surprised by it. Jake also texted me asking me if this means he won't be getting any more freelance from my current company.

TLDR: Asked my former boss/mentor if I could use him as a reference for a new role, and he spent the entire call with the hiring manager talking himself up."
"[UPDATE] My [31/M] Mom [54/F] and my sister [32/F] hate my girlfriend [29/F]


 

Well first off, here is the original thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c5ulc5/my31m\_mom\_54f\_and\_my\_sister\_32f\_hate\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c5ulc5/my31m_mom_54f_and_my_sister_32f_hate_my/)

So,  like it said in the thread, my sister wanted to talk to me that night  on Skype.  And just like I figured, she saw the room in the background  and the first thing she said was, ""What are you doing at her house?""  I  tried to tell her that I don't think of it as ""her house.""  I think of  it as ""our house.""  We both lived there together for 5 years.  Both of  our names are on the rental agreement.  It's not ""her house.""

So  after that I didn't have to say much.  She knew we were back together.    And she went off on me.  She went on a tirade about how I was finally  starting to show some improvement.  What was I thinking?  She should  have know I was just going to screw up, etc.  And this was all on the  computer when my girlfriend was home.  It was in my native language, so  my girlfriend couldn't understand it.  But she could tell it was a  heated conversation.

She asked if everything was ok and I shook my head and told her I would talk to her about it later.

So  then, I'm not even off the phone with my sister for a half hour, and my  Mom starts blowing up my Facebook messages, basically saying all the  same stuff my sister already said.  But of course she added that her and  my dad always expected so much more out of me.  I could have really did  great things with my life, but instead I decided to surround myself  with bad people and live a shitty existence.

My  girlfriend saw how upset I was by all of this and did what she could to  help.  But I really just needed to be alone for a while so I went out  driving around for an hour or so.

So...  basically over the last 10 days or so, what relationship I had with my  Mom and my sister has pretty much unraveled.  They both told me that  it's basically her or them.  Well, in my opinion blood is not always  thicker than water.  You can't choose your family.  My girlfriend is the  one who was in the hospital sleeping on a futon when I was recovering  from my suicide attempt.  My family wasn't here.  My girl helped support  me while I was unemployed.  (Yes, I have a job now.)  MY girlfriend was  my rock through a lot of hard times.  Yes, I did lean on my sister a  lot too.  But my sister clearly doesn't care much about what makes me  happy.

I don't know if this means my Dad and my brothers won't talk to me now either.  I guess I will find out.

To  me this seems so petty.  I just can't understand how they could be this  way.  My sister and I aren't even a year apart in age.  We were best  friends growing up.   Does that mean nothing?

And  neither of them can even tell me what it is they don't like about her  other than that she's just ""not good enough.""  And they both have said I  could do so much better.  I would love to know what they're definition  of ""so much better"" is.

So, that's what happened if anyone cares.  Any comments or advice or support is welcome.  Thanks.

TL;DR My Mom and my sister have pretty much disowned me because they don't like my girlfriend."
"Sister (24F) had a really abusive ex boyfriend. My parents (58M/59F) aren't dealing well with her dating a new guy (24M) and want me to ask her to break up with him.


My sister had an asshole of an ex boyfriend who use to hit her. There was this really bad incident where this guy beat her so badly she had to be admitted into hospital. The dude's in jail and that's all in the past. 

She remained single until she met one of my mates (24M). She took a liking to him over the year that she knew him. She gave me a heads up she wanted to get closer to him. They started to date around 8 months ago and they seem really happy. My parents got to see the two of them acting like a couple for the first time at a family vacation she wanted him to come on. They were at the fireplace in the cabin we rented. My sister was sitting between his legs and leaning back on his chest with a blanket on. My dad got kinda upset when he saw that but kept it to himself. He only told me recently he didn't like their closeness. 

My parents have been complaining to me ever since the trip that they don't want my sister getting to close to any other guy. I asked them what was wrong with Cam, and they didn't have an answer. He's never hit her. He treats her really well. She's the happiest I've seen her in a long time. They said they want me to talk to her about being single just for their own sanity of not having to worry. 

**TL;DR: Parents want me to ask sister to break up with new guy.**"
"UPDATE: I [17] haven’t seen my sister [19] in ten years, then found out my mum [40s] was the “other woman” in my dad’s [50s] first marriage.


Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/at2xk2/after_ten_years_of_no_contact_with_my_halfsister/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

So you guys gave me some advice and I took it. I found her on Instagram through some miracle, and I requested to follow her, which she accepted. It’s not much of an update, but she is interesting! She dyes her hair pink and blue. I don’t know what she’s actually like, to be honest. Is she nice? Is she nasty? I couldn’t ever tell.

I can’t find my brother. I don’t know how to spell his name.

I feel guilty. I’ll admit, a big reason why I found her is because I feel guilty. I get to have my dad. All the Father’s Days go to me, she gets nothing. He left her when she was 1. 

Is it bad to say I resent him for it? I’ll bet she does. I love him, but honestly? He doesn’t deserve a Father’s Day. He abandoned his role as a dad to two people.

You don’t get to dish out your love accordingly. You don’t get to pick and choose which children you’ll love and which ones you’ll forget. Yes, you’re with my mum NOW, but that doesn’t make me more of a daughter than her. But you were more of a dad to me than you were to those two combined. Do you think seeing them once a year is gonna compensate? A lonely card on their birthday with some money in?

Whatever, I might try to strike up a conversation with her soon but we’ll see. 

**TL;DR - I found my sister on Instagram and I’m starting to resent my dad for leaving her.**"
"My [20F] boyfriend [20M] guilt trips me for wanting to use something I own


I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year, we don’t live together so we don’t really “share” anything like extremely important.

My boyfriend likes his video games, like the usual younger guy. He owned a PS4 when I met him, I myself will play and generally enjoy video games so we play together often. My boyfriend only had one controller for his PS4 and I bought him a second one once just so I can play with him.

I grew up on nintendo stuff, I heard about the nintendo switch and I bought one for myself. 

My boyfriend became very very interested when I got it, and I’ve probably owned it about 8 months now. He offered to pay $100 of the total when I got it if he could borrow it every now and then and I agreed. 

To put in vision: I paid 300/400+, have bought 5 games (4 of them $80, one was $16) 

My boyfriend paid: 100/400+, bought one $80 game 

Since i’ve had it, it’s probably been in my house for like 5 days total within those 8 months. This isn’t my switch anymore. I usually go over to his house more than he does here, so when i’m over and we play it isn’t a problem but i’m serious, he won’t let me take it home. 

I’ve tried, and he gets all silent when I try to leave with it. It’s like a child and i’m speechless, he always complains how he’ll have “nothing to do now” and basically makes me feel guilty for taking something that’s mine. 

He has a PS4 but currently letting a friend borrow it, but this was just recently and doesn’t excuse the other months of struggle. I ask him to maybe just ask for his PS4 back but he just wants this switch. 

I ask him maybe he should get his own, but he can’t afford one and we both know that. But i’m lost on what to do, it’s such a small thing we share, and I don’t even feel like I own it, I have to ask him when i’m over to play my own console or if I can have a turn. How should I handle it as I feel like we’re siblings who can’t share and it’s frustrating. We are literally in our 20s and this situation is just baffling to me. Other than this frustrating thing we are in a pretty healthy relationship.

TL;DR : I bought a nintendo switch and my boyfriend borrows it but basically controls it now. He won’t let me take it without guilt tripping or complaining about it, how do i handle this immature argument?"
"I [f19] think my boyfriend [m23] is trying to ""trap"" me into being a parent by tampering with our birth control.


I met my now boyfriend because we both went to a comic-con and some of my friends that I went with knew him. We first started talking when I was 17 but didn't make it ""official"" until I turned 18. So we've been dating for a little over a year now. We don't 100% live together but we might as well...I help him pay his bills because I'm at his place 90% of the time anyways. As we've been dating longer...I've started to notice some red flags and I'm honestly confused about how to handle them because this is my first ""real"" relationship

I work as a waitress and make $2.15 an hour plus tips. So I obviously don't make a whole lot...enough to pay my bills and give him leftover money if he needs it. But he's starting to ""need"" it a whole lot more. He's become demanding of my time, attention and money and it's starting to grate my nerves. All of a sudden...it's an issue when I hang out with friends. He wants to ""check"" my phone. He's become kind of controlling and possessive and all of a sudden wants me to just move in so we can ""be closer together""

The only type of birth control we use is condoms.  I have been on the pill, the patch, and have had an IUD and I've had a bad reaction to every single one of them. So condoms is what we have to use when we have sex....I wish wee could use something else but I've had to trust him and so far he hasn't broken that trust...until now and I am thinking of just ending the relationship.

I found out I was pregnant last Wednesday. I felt super sick at work and nearly puked on a poor customer. One of my coworkers joked that I was probably pregnant and my paranoia kicked in so when I got off work...I bought a test and yep, it was positive. I didn't want to believe it. I kept as calm as I could until I got to my boyfriend's house and told him. It was like a switch flipped. He was OVER. THE. MOON. about it. He told me he couldn't wait to tell his parents and he was so excited to become a daddy. I just felt like I was going to puke again

He now wants me to move in. He wants me to quit my job. 
I don't have 100% proof but I have a gut feeling I cannot shake.  I'm scared he might have not worn a condom or something because he has been on this baby kick for a while now and it's terrifying. I do not want to become a mother. I don't have health insurance...hell I can barely afford to pay my own bills some months and need help from my parents still. I told him I wasn't 100% if I wanted to be a parent...and it's like another switch flipped. He got super angry, yelled at me. Called me a ""innocent baby killer"" and scared me by his anger so much I just left.

I 100% DO. NOT. want to be a parent. I do not want to have a baby at 19 when I can't even support myself. I'm really scared of what might of happened and I don't know how to end this relationship. I don't think I want to be with him any longer because of his behavior. I could use any advice here on this...TIA.


**TL;DR:** Not 100% sure bit I am afraid my boyfriend might have tampered with our birth control method to knock me up on purpose. He wants to be a parent, I do not. I don't know how to end this relationship but I think I want to. Help?"
"UPDATE - Fred didn't turn up to the stag do, today I will uninvite him to the wedding.


Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/buei18/i_25m_asked_a_friend_29m_to_my_stag_do_wedding/

My original post got a handful of really helpful comments &amp; wanted to start by thanking each of them for taking the time to help me realise the problem &amp; how to make the best of the situation.

So I returned from my stag do yesterday. Absolutely quality weekend with great company, voice has gone a little &amp; had the odd tipple. Wouldn't have changed anything about it, exactly what I was hoping for.

Since the last post, I got a call from Fred last week while I was at work. At a time of day that is inconvenient for almost everyone with a 9-5 job, so I couldn't answer.

I sent him a text message that evening, I decided to strip away anything that didn't get to the point: ""Hey dude, what's up?"", taking elements of the grey rock method which I've since learnt about. He replied two days later saying that he just wanted a catch up, I simply said I was looking forward to catching up on the stag do. I sent him a happy birthday message in the week, no response. That was it until the weekend.

What I didn't know until we were on the stag do was he had been messaging my best man separately, and within the space of the week before had told him the following:

- He wouldn't be able to arrive on the Friday, but would join on Saturday. (He ended up going out on Friday evening for birthday drinks with his partner &amp; posted a picture onto Instagram)
- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday morning activity, but would join in the afternoon.
- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday afternoon activity, but would be around in the evening.

Fred had only been messaging because some of the activities required deposits &amp; my best man had been chasing him. I'm told he hadn't contributed any ideas or messages into the group while it was being planned.

Saturday rolled around &amp; I finally got a message from Fred saying he won't be coming. He said a family member had an operation in the week &amp; had returned home yesterday.

Firstly, I wish that family member a speedy recovery. To me, it doesn't matter the reasoning but more the fact that Fred waited until the last possible moment before once again letting me down. This has now happened dozens of times where Fred cancels, delays or says yes until the day &amp; then ghosts us until we are all travelling home, this is far from the first time.

Coupled with his Instagram picture the night before, which was presumably taken the day his family member got home, I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding, and will respond to his message today. 

If Fred had messaged me last week saying he may not be able to come because reasons, I may have given him the benefit of the doubt. Waiting until the day to drop the news is normal for him.

The main reason alongside a poor communicator being I don't know this person anymore. He doesn't show any interest in keeping this friendship going and I am sure that if I dropped the rope we'd go to zero contact instantly. I've seen Fred once in 3 years &amp; I was hoping inviting him to the stag do would kick him into gear, he's had 10 months to back out or tell me he may not have been able to. He was a big part of my enjoyment during university &amp; I wanted to give him that chance.

I already expected the stag do &amp; wedding to be the last time I saw Fred as I was putting too much effort into the relationship for zero reward. It is such a shame that it happened how it did.

I had the best group of guys with me all weekend &amp; we had a blast the entire time, and am really looking forward to the wedding where I can get my family &amp; friends together to celebrate with my  future wife &amp; I. 

No more negativity or stress over a friendship that finished a long time ago.

Tl;dr - Friend decided to let me know at the last moment he wouldn't be turning up, after dozens of similar instances I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding."
"Husband (37m) came hone with a new car. I (36f) was surprised and upset. Now he’s threatening to divorce me.


Husband and I have been married for 9 years with 2 kids. Middle class family. We’ve had disagreements about money and how we spend it in the past.

Earlier this week he showed me a car that he liked (online). He currently have a car, no major issues and will be done with payments in several months. I’ve been really looking forward to having it paid off and freeing up some extra money each month. However, I know my husband has been getting the itch for a new vehicle. I would love to never have a car payment again but I know that’s a battle I won’t win because he likes to drive a newer car.

We chatted about this new vehicle. I told him to go check it out and the next day he came home with a new car.

I was shocked. I had no idea he was going to be signing papers that quickly.

I told him my feelings to which he responded that he thought I’d be happy for him (don’t know why he’d think that cause I’ve always hated our $400/month car payment and the new one is slightly more). 

A screaming match ensued with him threatening divorce. I told him I just need some time to process this new car and it’s continued payments but I’d get over it. He can’t believe I’m upset because he said that I told him he could get the car. 

He’s taken the kids and gone to his family’s house for the day leaving me home alone.

Where do I go from here? What do I say when he gets home?


TLDR: My husband came home with a new car. I was upset that he didn’t tell me and now he’s threatening to divorce me."
"What's the best way to ask a male acquaintance [26/f, 40/m] to stop casually touching me without causing a scene?


I'm someone who HATES being touched. I like my personal space, I have some sensory issues from being on the spectrum (this is private), and I'm also a huge germaphobe. Plus, I just hate it. 

Occasionally I run into guys who have obviously read some kind of PUA advice online about how casually touching women can lead to sex, how they need to break the ""touch barrier"" to make women ""comfortable"" with their touch. 

Some of these guys are malignant whereas others are just huge nerds who have no clue and are just looking for any advice.

Anyway, currently there is one guy who is doing this and the problem is he's not doing it enough to, like, rip his fucking hand off and beat him with it like I want to.

He's a huge nerd and basically, any time we all laugh in a group, he rests his hand on my shoulder or arm. Or sometimes when talking to me he makes gestures and touches me on my are. My level of ANGER is out of proportion to what he's actually doing so that's why I need help stopping this in a proportional way that doesn't cause a scene.

This guy is part of my social circle and goes to the places I go, so I need help stopping this in way that doesn't create a scene and make everything awkward FOR ME after that.

I also don't want to tell say that I generally don't want to be touched because I do let me female friends hug me even though I really hate it. To me that's a normal social expression of affection and has value because of that, I do not want to stop them from that, it's over in a moment. That's different than some random that I don't know or like touching me because he wants to get something from me, that I want to do without. 

I know I sound disproportionately angry about it, it's because touch like that really annoys me because of being on the spectrum. I also don't want to disclose being on the spectrum because I feel like it's nobody else's business.

tl;dr: What's the best way to ask a male acquaintance [26/f, 40/m] to stop casually touching me without causing a scene?"
"My (45/F) daughter (16/F) is in a relationship with a boy (17/M) who treats her like absolute trash and as her mother I'm at a loss for what to do in order to help her understand that he's not good for her.


She's a smart, capable young girl. Good grades, extracurricular involvement, solid group of friends, etc. Because her father isn't around (we divorced when she was still just a toddler and he only really interacts with her on birthdays and occasionally at Christmas if he's not busy) it's just us in the house and it's essentially always been that way. We're close. She tells me things that she's going through, how she feels, etc. I trust her judgment in most ways. In fact she's more mature than half of the grown, adult men and women that I know. But at the end of the day, she's still a child. And she doesn't have the life experience to know how to navigate certain situations. 

A few months ago she met a boy at her friend's hockey game. This boy was playing for the other school. They exchanged numbers and went to a movie and she seems really excited when she was telling me about him. Because she had never dated anyone before, I figured this would be a good experience for her. As long as she's safe and smart, that's all that matters to me as her mother. The boy swung by the house to pick her up. I spoke to him briefly by the front door. At first he seemed perfectly nice, polite, etc. He didn't give me controlling or arrogant energy. Not at all. 

They had a nice time and eventually went out again, when then turned into a relationship. He would come to the house and they would do their homework together in the kitchen. It was all very normal and uncomplicated. Then one night, a month or so ago, my daughter came home early from one of their dates. She rushed to her bedroom without saying a word to me. Slammed the door. I gave her a moment and then I went up there and knocked, asked if she could open the door for just a second. She said no at first but then I asked again after hearing her voice break. Clearly she was crying. I waited and she eventually opened the door in full blown tears. We talked. She explained that she and her boyfriend had argued. 

Apparently he didn't like that she was so close to her guy friend (the one whose hockey game she had attended when she and her boyfriend had first met) and he demanded that she ghost that friend if she wishes to remain in a relationship. It shocked me to hear that as this boyfriend had never really spoken to her in that way. Not around me. Given her reaction she seemed to be just as shocked and hurt by it. She said she refused to ghost her friend, which then led to an argument in the middle of the cafe where they had been on a date. There was name calling on his end. He accused her of wanting male attention ""from just any random guy"" and implied that she was probably cheating on him. Obviously that hurt her. When she started to tear up, he told her to ""grow a pair"" and then made her walk home in the dark when she refused to speak to him. 

We discussed what she should do moving forward and she said she was going to break up with him, which at that point, I was relieved to hear. No one should be treated that way. 

The following week I found out that they were still seeing each other. He pulled up to the house in his car at around nine o'clock on a school night. Her curfew is ten, so I sent her a quick text message to remind her that she had to be home in an hour. No questions. It takes a few tries before you can properly break up with someone. Especially at that age. It didn't come as a surprise to me that she was still seeing him. Although I no longer supported the relationship, I remembered what it was like being that age and that it's better to be open about these things than to forbid them. She's 16. If I had so much as tried to tell her not to see him, she would only have done it in secret and possibly landed herself in some sort of trouble because she would have felt she couldn't talk to me about it given that I no longer approved. 

Things were okay for a couple of weeks. She was home on time, she was working a part-time job, etc. Then about three days ago the same thing happened. She came home in tears and told me that they had argued again. Although she didn't say what happened, I could see that it was similar to before. And the entire time she was in front of me in the kitchen, he was calling and texting her and blowing up her phone. I noticed that he was parked outside of the house. I was upset for her. Maybe it wasn't right of me to react this way, but I had just about had enough of him by that point, so I walked out and approached his car and made him come out so we could talk. 

He put on the polite, respectful act and acted as if he had no idea why I was upset. I told him that my daughter wasn't in the mood to speak to him tonight and that he should go home before I call his parents. My daughter then realized what was going on and came rushing outside. She told me to ""stay out of it"" and insisted that she was ""handling it"" on her own. I told her that I understand but also that I'm her mother and that it's not right for her to be coming home in tears multiple times. Something is clearly wrong. That's not normal. Relationships aren't supposed to feel that way. Although she was a tad upset with me for involving myself, she also maintained that she wasn't in the mood to speak to him, and so he went home and stopped calling and texting the rest of the night. 

The following morning she was gone when I woke up. I know for sure that she had spent the night at our house, given that I had woken up for a glass of water at around five o'clock in the morning and checked on her to find her fast asleep in bed. I figured she had left to go see him and speak about what happened. When I called her to make sure, she didn't answer. At a loss, I called one of her friends to ask them what they knew. They said that she was with her boyfriend and seemed just as disapproving of it as I was by then. They also implied that she had distanced herself from the group in recent weeks. That surprised me more than anything. 

She came home at nine o'clock at night, made up some story about seeing her friends and then went up to her bedroom. I was so exhausted that I didn't even call her out on the lie. I was just happy that she was home and safe. Later that same night I got a call from my mother about needing a ride to the doctor the following morning, so I went to bed earlier than usual. I woke up in the middle of the night again for a glass of water, popped into my daughter's bedroom to check on her and realized she wasn't home. I checked everywhere. She wasn't in the house. I called her but the calls went straight to voicemail. I called her friends but they didn't know where she was. Finally I called her boyfriend only for the call to be declined. After about twenty minutes of pacing the living room, one of her friends called me back (the guy friend on the hockey team) and said that he had contacted a few people and found out that she was at a party in the next city over. 

He told me where and gave me the number of one of his teammates who were there, so I could speak to her. Apparently her phone was broken. I can only imagine how that had happened. I called the number and got in touch with her and of course she was crying, scared, etc. I told her that I was heading over to pick her up and that she wasn't in trouble as long she was honest with me about everything. She agreed that she would tell me what happened and so I went over there. It was a long ride home. She explained that her boyfriend had taken her to the party without telling her where they were going. And when she demanded that he drop her off at the train station so she could go home, he took the phone out of her hands and tossed it so hard into the backseat of his car that it broke. He then apologized, manipulated her into going to the party with him and made promises that he would do better. At the party he had a lot to drink, so much that he just started kissing and touching some other girl right in front of her. When she called him out on his behaviour, he told her that he ""has to get it from someone"" and if it's not going to be her then ""fuck it"". That's why she was so upset. She didn't know anyone there and basically hid in the bathroom until her friend was able to get a hold of her. 

After that I told her to just go to bed and that we can talk about this more in the morning. She went with me to drop my mother off to the doctor a few hours later. We talked in the waiting room and I explained to her that this relationship is only going to get worse. Her boyfriend has shown her his true colours multiple times now. He has not only disrespected her as a woman, he has also attacked her character and left her in unsafe situations. That's not okay. No guy is worth that kind of bullshit. She was nodding the whole time and saying words of agreement. She told me that it was harder than she thought, breaking up with someone. I told her that I understood and that it's okay that she wasn't able to have a clean break at first. But it's important she at least *try* to do that now. 

She typed up a text message to him right in front of me, basically calling him out of his behaviour and saying that she was done with him. No amount of apologizing will work this time. 

This lasted about two days. 

Last night I heard them talking on the phone. I know when she's talking to him because she always sounds as though she's on the verge of tears. Honestly I don't know what to do anymore. I can't just lock her in the house and demand that she listen to me. Obviously she's shown me that she's capable of sneaking out and seeing him anyway. I would rather she feel comfortable enough to speak to me when things go wrong. But at the same time, she has shown that she's not in the right frame of mind to be making these types of decisions. I remember what it was like at her age. I know there's not much I can say or do. But I'm worried. Everyday I'm worried that I'm going to get that one call that changes everything. 

Also I did call his parents to let them know that he broke her phone and they ordered her a new one. 

Other than that, I don't know what more I can say or do to get through to my daughter. 

Suggestions?

**tl;dr** He was nice at first but he's not anymore. I don't know what more I can say or do to get through to my daughter. I don't want her to feel like she has to lie to me and keep things a secret, so I've been trying to be patient, but everyday I worry for her. Not sure what to do."
"Update: I'm [27F] struggling with my MIL's [63F] decision to move across the country to live near us.


Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/c6vatr/im_27f_struggling_with_my_mils_63f_decision_to/

TL;DR - MIL still lives in La-La Land, but she's no longer living in my house.

Update:
Long story short, by some miracle, she found a place in her budget that's fairly close (10 minutes) to us with immediate availability for move in. We hired movers to unload her stuff from the moving truck last Wednesday, then we left on Thursday for a road trip over the long weekend, thinking she'd get herself moved in and settled while we were gone. 

We got back Sunday afternoon and she was still in our house, saying she couldn't stay at the new place yet because her silverware was in a box in our storage unit. So rather than unpacking, showering and relaxing after camping for 4 days, we went to our storage unit, sifted through her boxes, loaded up our truck, and moved more of her stuff (in 100-degree heat). She still wasn't ready to be in her new place Sunday night (still not clear to me why) so she stayed at our house again. Monday morning, my SO told her she needs to stay at the new place, and thankfully when we got home from work last night, she was not there. 

She's finally starting to realize (I think) that she may have been hasty in moving down here. It's hot. She's now at a low-quality apartment (because that's all her budget allows for) with no yard for her dog. She claims to be independent but then wants us (or at least, my SO) to help her with every little thing, but we work full time and have our own lives to deal with and cannot drop everything to go couch shopping. She's got a bit of an entitled attitude about the lifestyle she thinks she deserves, not realizing that it's not realistic with her budget, and has made comments that make us think she's going to have some adjustments moving to a place with a high Hispanic population. Also, I think we'll need to change the door code on our house because she should not be at our place uninvited and I suspect she'll be dropping by a lot. I told my SO that it's going to be his job to set hard boundaries with her, and he says he can do that.

It's going to be an ongoing adjustment to having her here. But we're getting through it."
"My (28m) girlfriend (28f) and I have been dating for 12 years. It’s going nowhere fast and I’m questioning our future.


I really need some perspective, I have no idea what to do.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend since high school (12 years), and we’ve lived together for 8 years. We love each other and it’s a strong relationship in many ways (supportive, fun, plenty of intimacy).

The thing is I want a life together, with the usual trappings (marriage, kids, house), we’ve talked about this in the past and she’s expressed similar sentiments. I’m by no means stubborn or exact in what this looks like, but I know I want stability and vaguely what life will look like.

About 8 months ago she expressed she didn’t know where things were going, in her life or our relationship, and that it made her anxious. She also expressed some other things like wanting more time together, that she’s attracted to women, and that she wants financial support to pursue jobs/hobbies she’s interested in. The time together is fair and we both agree I’ve worked on this, the hobbies/job stuff I’ve given her support on but she’s moving slowly, and the bisexuality is not something I can do anything about as we’re monogamous (she hasn’t asked for more).

I agreed to support her and stay together but gave two non-negotiables. Firstly, that she regularly communicated her feelings (as lack of communications led to this disconnect), and secondly that she took steps towards knowing what she wanted in the future.

It’s been 8 months, I reminder her monthly of what we agreed on, but she’s “just enjoying living in the moment” and it’s not progressing. This makes me feel like we have no future, really effects my self-esteeme (how can this woman not see a future together? This has been my everything), and makes me feel un-valued as she knows this is important to me. I think she doesn’t like thinking about this stuff as it’s challenging and heavy, and she’s a free spirit.

I have no idea where to draw the line. I’d really appreciate your thoughts. I always thought we’d be together forever but at a certain point I think if we don’t have a future together I’d rather call it and we can both look for different people and enjoy different experiences.

What to do! Help?!

TL;DR - My (28m) free spirited GF (28f) doesn’t know what she wants from our 12 year relationships. Over 8 months she agreed to communicate better and work towards knowing what she wants, but she hasn’t deliver on this. This has left me worrying if we have a future."
"I (24f) found out bf (36m) might have a 10+ years relationship with another person (36?f) and maybe engaged?


My first post, I'm desperate and crushed

I met him, we were friends, never told me about being in a relationship, kept saying not married, no kids... 
Started a relationship (he has no ring marks on his fingers) and like 2 or 3 months ago, i found her profile on facebook, thanks to a friend of mine, i was venting to him that he was distant and a lot of other stuff and he thought it was fishy so he asked me for my bf's name and found out about her.

We've been together for almost a year, he met all of my family but i haven't met his.. always thought it was because I'm too young...

After my friend searched and gave me her name I started getting sick and went nuts to get more and more information... I feel like a total stalker, found all of his family on Facebook and some friends that he has mentioned, where she works and pictures of them from before him and i were dating (he said they broke up more than 4 years ago, but a picture where the tittle said woman and her fiance 'myboyfriend' is from less than 2 years ago...)


Took me all this time to confront him, like 2 to 3 weeks ago I finally did. He got all upset accusing me of spying and saying that i didn't know anything that i was assuming the wrong thing and that i wasn't how i thought it was, saying that i was accusing him of stuff that wasn't real and made me feel like a total jerk. 

Told me it was none of my business, to stay away from all of that.

I have to remark that i don't have a strong personality, so when i say confront i meant saying it almost crying, I mean, found out i might be someone else's affair... feels awful...


What should i do?
Should i tell her?
He asked me to not contact her

TL;DR - found out boyfriend potentially has another relationship and found her information and profile on Facebook and I'm trying to find my way to my next step..."
"An Anonymous Instagram Account messaged me saying that my girlfriend of 2 years (18F) was cheating on me (18M) with my best friend (18M)


So the other day, a blank Instagram account with no followers nor following anybody created a post that said “your (GF’s name) cheated on you with (Best Friend’s Name)”, and tagged me in the photo. After messaging the person, he/she said that someone told them that it happened, and they couldn’t “stand by and not tell me”. I was skeptical at first, but the account mentioned some facts/events that were true and proceeded to tell me that someone “very” close to me told them. The account also mentioned that they “didn’t not feel guilty about it, and would do it again” 

Now, I don’t want to believe the validity of this statement as I trust my gf and best friend a lot, but this planted a seed of doubt in my mind and I can’t help but be skeptical. They’ve spent the night at her house without me once, and they have a very touchy friendship. Also, lately she’s had a much lower sex drive and frequently rejects my attempts.

Is this just a cruel joke? Would anyone actually do this out of spite, or should I investigate the situation at hand? Would I be able to detect awkward body language after the encounter, if it actually happened? I am just freaking out for no reason? Lol

TL;DR: Anonymous Instagram account messaged me that my gf was cheating on me with best friend. Some facts checked out, so I’m skeptical."
"My (48) GF (48) of four years broke up with me and blocked my number so I can’t contact her. Her cable, internet, phone, and car insurance are in my name and are auto debited from my checking account. Should I just turn everything off with no notice?


She said for me to never contact her again in any way, so I don’t know what to do. I feel like turning all of these services off and cancelling her car insurance with no notice, would be kind of a jerk move. 

TL;DR She broke up with me in a cruel manner. She’s a good person and is not a user. But she did let these bills (which total over $300 monthly) get debited from my account shortly after breaking up with me and blocking my number and blocking me from Facebook. I don’t think I should keep paying them."
"My [20F] fiance [24M] has been very insensitive about my niece's death. He is 'refusing' to let me go to her funeral.


Im not really in the best headspace right now so sorry if this doesnt make sense, Im also using my phone so sorry for any mistakes.

I have an older sister [shes 27] who is married and has been trying for 2 years to have a baby. Her and her husband have gone into thousands of dollars of debt and finally got pregnant with IVF and my sister was able to carry the pregnancy until 22 weeks when she had a placental abruption. The hospital she delivered at refused to do any life saving techniques for my niece. They did something called comfort care and my niece passed away a couple hours ago with her mom and dad holding her. She was super loved and even though I didn't get to meet her, I cried when my brother in law told me the news because I wanted to be there for them. My sister and I dont have parents, we were mostly raised in the foster care system. We've always had just each other and that's it

My fiance and I have been together for 2 years, engaged for a little over 6 months. We started living together when we got engaged. I was super excited to start planning my wedding because my sister would be my maid of honor and my niece would probably end up being the flower girl. I was so excited to be an aunt. My fiance is still on the fence of whether or not he wants kids but he never seemed to mind me talking about my sister and her pregnancy, if he did, he never told me. We have an imbalance in our relationship right now because I was let go from my job due to downsizing. I get unemployment but it's barely enough to cover my share of the bills. Some months I come up short and need his help covering stuff - in the past he had said some hurtful stuff but I also have to acknowledge is under stress with his job too so I try not to take it personally.

When my brother in law called me to tell me about my niece's passing , it broke my heart. I know he and my sister are devastated because they tried so hard for a baby. My brother in law asked me to come as soon as possible because my sister wants me there with her. I did some math, and still came up short for a plane ticket [they live a 16 hour drive away] and I hung my head in shame and asked my fiance if he could help me cover the rest and I would pay him back as soon as possible

He said no - which I would have understood if he just left it at that. But no, he got angry because I asked for help and started yelling. He said ""Why should I give a fuck about a dead baby?"" and ""Maybe if your sister went to church more, God wouldn't have killed her baby"" and ended it by yelling ""FUCK YOU"" at me and slamming our bedroom door so hard he knocked photos off the wall. He then came back out a few minutes later and got in my face and yelled at me, telling me I am not allowed to go to help my sister and he would ""make sure it didn't happen"". 

I think this is justifiable reason to just leave him. This isn't the first time he's blown up on me before but this has been the worst time ever. I don't know what I did wrong - I really don't, I pay my share of the bills on time. I've even gone to a food bank before to make our groceries stretch much to his dismay [he thinks people will look down on us for using a food bank and has called me a ""peasant"" in a joking/non-joking way]. I don't feel entitled to his time or money, I just wanted some help to be there for my sister because I know if the roles were reversed, she would be there for me. 

I just don't know what to do. I want to be there for my sister. I want my fiance to understand where I'm coming from. I feel sick like there's  rock in the pit of my stomach over it. I could use any advice on the matter. Huge thanks in advance.

*TL;DR:* My sister lost her daughter at 22 weeks. She wants me to be there to help plan my niece's final arrangements. My fiance said some really hurtful things and is refusing to help/telling me I can't go to my niece's funeral. I'm just not sure what to do here."
"My [36F] husband [36N] won’t leave our hometown. Should I leave on my own?


My husband and I have been married for 12 years. No kids. When we got married, we planned to move away from our small hometown, live in a big city, etc. We agreed on this before marriage. 

Well, 12 years have passed and at this point, I don’t think we will ever move anywhere or leave this place. My husband is extremely adverse to any sort of risk whatsoever. I was offered a job in NYC a few years ago, but he refused to move. He convinced me the job didn’t pay enough for me to live on my own.

I’ve struggled with depression in the past few years. I’m terrified I’m stuck forever. Everyday I think about just packing my car and leaving. We have a very large amount of savings and zero debt. 

My husband is a wonderful man. I want my marriage, but I don’t want to live here any longer. 

Help? Do I leave? Stay? What?

TL;DR: I want to leave a pursue dreams. Husband likes a stable life. What should I do?"
"I've (36f) given 16 yrs of my life to a man (36) who assaults women &amp; lied to me about a new job. How do I tell our son (9)?


This is a really long story but I just need to get all of this out.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband &amp; I were highschool sweethearts, got married in college. Senior year, there were accusations that my husband had been inappropriate with one of the girls on the jv volleyball team his uncle coached. It was kept really quiet, I only knew because my husband told me what was happening. He swore up &amp; down it wasn't true, he'd never hurt a girl or woman, he'd never laid a finger on any of them, &amp; he'd never said any of the things the girl was saying he had. It was just a dumb teenager with a crush being a dumb teenager with a crush, lashing out because he'd never even noticed her.

&amp;#x200B;

I believed him.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple years out of college, he got really, really drunk one night at a neighborhood bbq. He was falling all over the place &amp; slurring,. I was trying to get him home &amp; he fell into a couple of women who had been chatting, and he said some really inappropriate things. I dragged him to the car &amp; the next morning I woke him up banging pots &amp; pans. I asked him if he remembered what he said, he said he didn't, so I told him. &amp; I told him that I didn't understand how I could be married to that person. He was so wonderful... where had that come from??? He said he didn't know, he was drunk, he hadn't thought at all about what he was saying. He promised it would never happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years later there was another incident with with a woman when he was drunk at a work NYE party. I wasn't there for that one because I had a hospital shift &amp; he told me she came onto him. I believed him this time, because I still couldn't believe I had married that person. It felt like who he was when he was drunk was so so different from who he was the rest of the time. Sure he wans't perfect, especially because it's like he can't process consequences actually happening to him, but I'm not exactly a saint.

&amp;#x200B;

I had PPD and PPA really bad after the birth of our son &amp; he supported me through it. He took such good care of our baby &amp; such good care of me when I couldn't even get through doing dishes &amp; I was angry about everything for no reason. He stayed up nights with me when I was convinced the best thing would be if I just left him &amp; our son &amp; went away. How could that man grope a coworker? How could he say horrible things to women? It didn't make sense to me, so I guess I just kind of ignored it.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved to NV a few years ago and that's when things started getting really weird. There was a Cinco de Mayo company picnic about 3 mos after he started his new job there &amp; for once I could go. Everyone there I talked to (except 1 guy who remembered me from a really weird ED visit) was surprised to learn I was a charge nurse at the hospital. My husband had been telling everybody I was a SAH mom. I swear I feel like I see our son less then he does, what the hell was this SAH business?!?! I laughed it off at the picnic but when we got home I wanted to know what the fuck he had been telling people and WHY. And he just looked at his feet &amp; said he'd been scared he wouldn't fit in. &amp; I know that corporate offices are more conservative, but really?????? How does ""corporate office guy marries a nurse &amp; they both work a lot to pay their mortgage &amp; childcare"" not fit in in Nevada?!?!?!?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

Well now it's gotten even weirder &amp; I don't believe him anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe him anymore, because about a yr ago he got fired from a decent job (100k+/yr, d-ops). He told me it was because he'd disagreed with the COO about the company's direction, whatever the hell that meant. That wasn't great but I wasn't going to be mad at him for sticking his ground and trying to do the right thing for the company, &amp; it wasn't like we couldn't afford him to be out of work a while. I don't make as much as he did but it's very decent money, and we had plenty of savings. Plus we could save on childcare &amp; housekeeping if he stayed home w/ our son, right? Haha our house had never been messier.

&amp;#x200B;

Well 3 mos later he found a job. Glory hallelujah! He'd get up, go jogging, put on a shirt &amp; tie, &amp; he'd be out until after I got home. We adjusted childcare hours &amp; I brought the housekeeper back &amp; I didn't think it was weird that he was putting so much time in. It was a brand new job &amp; he just got fired, he had to prove himself.

&amp;#x200B;

2 mos ago I was home with our son who brought some kind of godawful summer flu home from daycamp &amp; the washing machine started flooding our laundry room. We buy our water so I had to shut off all the water to the house. I couldn't find his notes from our plumber (so I could make sure I had everything off) so I called him. He wasn't answering his phone so I tried the main office number. The woman who was supposed to be his admin didn't even know his name. I was freaking out at this point, so she transferred me to the hiring manager &amp; after I freaked out some more, she told me the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband did great on the phone screen &amp; interview, but he never passed the reference check. He didn't work there. He'd never worked there. They would never have hired him after what his last company said about him: he'd been fired for sexually harassing a woman at a work conference.

&amp;#x200B;

He lied about why he was fired. He lied about finding a job. He lied about where the money he's been using to pay for thins has come from, he's been using our savings. He's been lying to me from the start. He probably lied about the girl on the volleyball team. I've been loving &amp; supporting &amp; enabling this monster for sixteen years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking to a divorce lawyer soon, but it's so shocking. I feel so stupid. How did I not know? &amp; how am I going to explain this to our son? This is going to rock his world &amp; I mean like an earthquake, not a concert. He's 9 yrs old, what the hell do I tell him?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my high school sweetheart has a history of being weird about women, got fired for sexual harassment, lied about it, lied about getting a new job, &amp; has been burning through our savings. I'm going to divorce him, but I don't know if or what I should tell our son about what's really happening."
"I was kicked out at 18 fresh out of high school. A year later my mom texts me complaining how she’s not a part of my life and that it’s my fault


A little back ground information. Growing up I was by no means a “good kid”. I continuously got into trouble but I only acted out when I was at home, never at school or in front of other people. Also my dad was in the Army growing up so I’m constantly moving every three years. I never really had friends and to make matters worse I always felt like an outcast because my dad adopted me and my siblings are only my half siblings. Growing up I felt like I was always the odd one out, always the only one getting punished. So when I turned 18 and graduated it was no surprise when my parents kicked me out claiming they had no idea how to take care of me anymore and blaming it on me. For a while I didn’t want to have a relationship with my mom but finally came to terms with everything she’s done and reached out to her to try and start healing. 

Fast forward to today I thought I was making progress in my relationship with my mom. She was responding most times when I texted her and even started saying “I love you back to me.”  She texted me this morning and asked for pictures of me and my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I aren’t very photogenic and I dislike having pictures taken of myself so I had only one picture. I sent it to her and she kept asking for more. I tried to explain to her that I didn’t have anymore. After about 30 minutes of telling her I didn’t have anymore she asked me for a picture of just me. Since I’ve been going through some things since she last saw me I’ve dyed my hair several times. I sent her a picture of each time I dyed my hair a new color at her request and she got upset saying that I had changed and she didn’t know who I was anymore. I said something along the lines of it had been over a year since I’d seen them and I had recently tried to go to them to visit but that they had declined saying they were too busy. She then got even more angry with me because I hadn’t been sending pictures. One, I assumed that they wanted nothing to do with me when I moved out. I had no financial help from them, nothing. And two we’ve never had the type of relationship where I’d feel comfortable sending unsolicited pictures. If she wants them great she could ask and I’d send them. But sending pictures out of the blue would just felt plain weird. She then attacked me for wanting to come for a visit but rarely ever calling and never sending pictures. I tried to be civil and explain that it felt weird sending pictures that weren’t asked for and that we really weren’t that close a few months ago. I tried really hard not to stoop to her level but it got to the point where she was attacking me and calling me immature. I finally stuck up for myself and said I’m tired of living in the past and want to move on but that she’s not ready to. She then sent me huge paragraphs basically telling me what a failure I am, that I’m a disgrace to my family, that it’s no wonder that I’m such a disappointment, and that I need to grow up. All I sent in return was “I love you ❤️” and didn’t give her the gratification of retaliation on my part. 

But after this I have no idea what to do. Is there any way to salvage this relationship or should I just stop trying. I love her so much. But I feel like I need to stop and take some time to heal myself. I’m so lost. 

TL;DR: My mom flew off the handle at me today because we don’t have a good relationship and I didn’t send her pictures. She then proceeded to blame the failing relationship on me. I finally stuck up for myself but don’t know where to go from here."
"My (f25) boyfriend (m35) of 5 years just told me he’s gay.


Tl;dr at bottom. He just called me at work to tell me because it couldn’t wait. I had to leave and go home so I’m waiting for him to get off work right now. I’m so confused and so numb. I haven’t been able to stop crying and my stomach is in knots. We’ve been together almost 5 years. Has it all been a lie? All been fake? I’m absolutely shattered right now and I have no idea how to proceed. I can’t even begin to comprehend this. I feel betrayed and hurt and lied to. I feel broken. I know there are support groups available for him but what about me? What comes next? How do I come to terms with this? 

Tl;dr boyfriend of 5 years just came out to me. Please help."
"How do I (27f) tell my bf (30m) that I don't want to hear about his fun trip?


My boyfriend of 7 years went to a 2 day camping/party trip a few days ago with some of his friends. The party was for his friend's girlfriend, and with about 40 people being invited, my bf's friend decided to invite his friends (including my bf). I was originally invited to this by my bf - although I never received a direct invite from the friend or his gf I know they had asked if I was coming along as these are people I've met numerous times before and really get along with.

A few days before the event, my bf changed his mind about bringing me because the only other friend in his friend group that has an SO, wasn't bringing their SO along. I'm also fairly new to the country and have expressed to my bf when I first moved, how I'm struggling to meet new people and make friends here as an expat. I don't get to do a ton of stuff like this anymore as I don't know a ton of people, and the event would have been a great opportunity to meet new people. We, as a couple do a lot of things together so I can understand if he wanted a few days with just his friends but I felt like this particular event wasn't the right one to do so. So I was obviously hurt that he no longer felt like he could bring me along despite 40 people being at this event.

He apologized for doing this but the 2 days he was gone sucked especially when he kept sending me photos and whatnot of the party. I know he's doing this because he just genuinely wants to tell me about his trip. I'm doing my best to be interested in hearing about it, and move on from the fact that I was uninvited. But if I'm honest, I don't really want to keep hearing about how much fun he had at a party while I was trying to distract myself from the fact that I was uninvited to something fun I could have gone to.

Would it be immature of me to tell him I don't really want to hear about the event?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - boyfriend invited me and then uninvited me to a 2 day party. I don't want to keep listening to him talk about how much fun he had. Would it be immature if I told him this?"
"Daughters (9f 9f) want to donate our vacation fund to help the homeless. I (32) think we should let them, my husband (41) does not



Our twin daughters (9 years old) have been wanting to go to Disney for a while, and my husband and I decided we'd start saving, but the girls would have to help ""earn"" money. Whenever either of them would get an a on a school assignment, do a good deed to help someone, do extra chores, etc... We'd deposit a little more money in the disney fund. 

By now, the girls had earned almost enough, and we were sure they'd be able to earn the rest in the next few weeks. We've got over $5000 in there now.

The girls are in girls scouts right now, and have been working towards a badge that involves community service. Them and several of their friends have been volunteering at a homeless shelter's cafeteria. 

This weekend, the girls told me they wanted to use their Disney fund to help the homeless, they heard how the shelter had to turn people away at night because they didn't have enough beds, and didn't have the money to just get more beds. And how some supplies like toiletries were in such short supply. 

I asked where the idea came from, and they said they thought of it themselves, they just didn't think it was fair for them to be using the money they earned to go on vacation when there are people who can't even sleep inside at night. 

I thought that was a lovely idea, and I was blown away that they'd decide they'd rather donate the money than go on a vacation they've been excited for, for almost a year now. 

I told my husband what the girls had said, and he said that was cute of them. But obviously we'd still go to Disney.

That bothered me, and I told him that if the girls had earned that money and want to do something selfless with it, we should encourage that. What would we be teaching them if we said no? That having fun is more important than helping people less fortunate? 

He said that the girls hadn't earned that money. He had earned it at work, and even with their little chore agreement, it wasn't their money. Plus he'd always wanted to show our kids Disney, he loves the parks, and wanted to share that as a family ever since the girls were born.

I started to feel like he wanted to go for selfish reasons, because he's a Disney fan, not because that's what the girls actually want.

What should we do as a family?

tldr - daughters want to donate our Disney trip fund to help the homeless. I want to support them, my husband does not"
"Friend (26f) never shares her friends but expects to be invited to all my (26f) social circle activities


This is a strange problem to have in adulthood but it is wearing on my friendship. I have known Megan for 3 years and she is now integrated into my small circle and close friends with all my friends. This is fine and normal and I wouldn't want to stop this, however I sometimes feel pangs of jealousy as my old friends often spend more time with her than me (she has more free time). But that's just how circles work. Chances are if you get along with someone you'll get along with their friends too!

One thing that bugs me is that Megan only ever arranges to see me 1 on 1. She goes to other social events in our small town but never invites me. It's her birthday this weekend and she's seeing my friendship group and then going to a party which she could definitely invite us to, but hasn't. 

Am I overreacting about the lack of friend sharing? Is that the friendship norm I feel it to be? I feel like I've been very generous with my circle and invited her to a lot, even when I find it difficult (ex boyfriends, old / very dear friends etc). 

TL,DR I invite my friend to my inner circle, get no reciprocation / invites to social events in three years. Am I wrong to feel resentful?"
"I think my [31 F] husband [34 M] is obsessed with my sister-in-law. We have been married for 4 years.


About a year ago I discovered my husband had looked up my SIL's Instagram page multiple times. I know what you're thinking but I truly did not intend on snooping. I was using his phone to look someone or something up.  This is when I started to notice a pattern of him being particularly interested in her. He hates hanging out with my family unless he finds out she will be there then he bends over backwards to attend, conversations gravitate towards her and, he seems to be eager to help her and my brother out to a greater degree than other family members and friends. 

I know technically he hasn't been unfaithful but I feel really hurt and unloved. How do I even bring this up.. do I? Maybe I am crazy and have attributed wrong motives to him but I can't shake the feeling like he's obsessed with her. Any advice on how you would handle these feelings and the situation would be very appreciated. Thank you.

**TL/DR** I think my husband has a thing for my sister-in-law and I feel like crap."
"He (29M) is terrified of me (27F) getting pregnant


I’ve been dating someone for around 4 months. We both want children someday but not now. We use condoms every time but he’s terrified of getting me pregnant. He asks me about my periods—he’ll ask me (more than once) when my last one was and whether I’ve gotten my next one yet. My period was once a couple of days late, and he became consumed with anxiety and stated that he was ""so, so scared."" If I have anything going on (headache, bad mood, etc.), he gets anxious that it is a symptom of pregnancy. He’s also made it clear he would want me to get an abortion if I did get pregnant. Am I wrong to feel weird and insulted by this? 

tl;dr: boyfriend is terrified that I'll get pregnant, and I'm frustrated by it."
"My BIL(M31) is a narcissit, how do i(F24) deal with him for the rest of my life?


TD;LR: my brother in law is a narcissit, and since his brother(28) and i got engaged almost a year ago he has caused me so much drama and stress

This might be long so apologies is advance.

A bit of backstory, my now BIL was dating my best friend for three years and broke up last summer. My fiance and i met a year after they started dating and hit it off quickly. 


I never knew my BIL had such a bad personality. He is just the biggest asshole ive ever met. After the break up i sat with his ex (also my bff) and she told me how he was and how he used to treat her, and i confess i didnt believe he was THAT bad....until i saw it for myself. 

After the breakup in about 2 months he started trying to get back with her and this lasted a whole year. Her answer was no. He involved me and would tell me everything but would get angry if she told me anything and would say its private. 



Throughout all this time he would lie, blame everyone else for the breakup but never take any responsibility for anything. Manipulate pple to believe his side of the story. He also would tell anyone who would listen his version of events thats twisted. And anyone who calls him out or doesn't support him becomes his enemy and he bad mouthes them. (By them i mean me) 


He judges me for hanging out with her, for my fiance and i going out with my group of friends which include her and her brother. He is sure she convinced me with her lies and blames me for it. Hates that i tell his brother everything (we never hide anything from one another) 


And when she rejected him last month for the final time, he told me that she and her parents ARENT ALLOWED TO BE IN MY WEDDING OR HE WONT ATTEND. I told him its not an option, and he blew up in my face even more. 
(Her parents and my parents are very close friends as well. Which makes it even more impossible of a demand)

Ofcourse his brother and parents know all about it an support me 100%. They know how he is and stood by me. My fiance talked to him for 3 hours on the phone trying to make him see reason. But then BIL goes around his family (aunts and cousins) and tells them about this (while playing the victim) and made me look like a homewrecker. And i received msgs from them that if he doesnt attend, they will not.

My FIL interfered when this happened and shut everything down. And made his son apologize to me and backdown on his ""condition""


But then, something else happens and he blames me and texts me in a very angry and disrespectful manner. Although i have absolutely nothing to do with the whole thing. 
These are just examples that come to my mind. There is alot more. 
My fiance is a very reasonable man, and knows his brother exceedingly well. He has tried to tell him to stop getting me involved and texting me over every small thing but he doesnt listen. His whole family has my back and are trying to support me best way they can. 

I am at my rope's end. I dont want to ruin the relationship between the brothers, and no matter how much distance i put between myself and him, it doesn't seem to work. 

How do i deal with him???"
"I(17M) was pepper sprayed by my girlfriend's childhood friend(15F).


Me and my girlfriend were making-out doing teen stuff in a river tunnel next to her house. Her friends found us and she jumped out of the boat, I stayed in and drifted out of the tunnel. Her friend that will be called Lexy from now on, grabbed my pepper spray that I keep for self defense and pointed it at me.

I told Lexy to obviously stop and put it back but she sprayed a little out and i got out of the boat immediately, Once I was out of the water, I grabbed her and tried to grab the pepper spray from her, I missed and instead pushed her into the creek, This is where Lexy sprayed me.

I luckily, I didn't get too much in my eyes but I got enough to feel the effects for the stated 30-45mins.

Next, As i start to feel the effects, I become completely blind to my surroundings and asked if I could have help to the hose outside. My girlfriend starts to be smart and instead of helping me to the hose, Makes me crawl my blind, pain ridden ass back to the hose. Only after I make it past the steps does she come and help me to the hose.

At this point, I am feeling all the pain and glory, The only thing holding me back from crying out, Is the sweet relief of cold hose water. 

My question that is bothering me, Is that am I over reacting if I push to break up with my girlfriend?

She showed me no real empathy, side from the casual ""how's your face doing"" and grabbing ice cream for me to rub on my face. She didn't actively come up to me and ask if I needed anything, infact, she joked around with her friends. I personally don't think I am welcome in that friend group, No one put real effort into asking if I was ok. With the exception of my girlfriends mother, That beautiful saint actually googled how to counter pepper spray, turns out soap helps?

After all was said and done, I was sprayed at 645 my time and i was finally up and running again around 740. Even then, I was visibly disgruntled and my Girlfriend sat with her friends while i cleaned myself up. I left 2 hours earlier than normal and made my way back home.

TLDR: Girlfriend's friend sprayed pepper spray at me, My girlfriend gave little empathy and she would rather sit with her friends and joke with them, Than comfort me.

Am I over reacting for want to decide I don't want to be with her anymore? We have a good relationship on most fronts, We've dated for like 6 months but known each other for 8. I feel like I'm not very important to her and I feel like this was a red flag for our relationship."
"My (37 F) boyfriend (35 M) said he would leave me for his ex wife


The craziest thing happened to me. I reconnected with my first love. It's been 12 years and we have a son together. We both have been married and divorced and have decided to give it another shot between us. I thought things have been going well and I am ecstatic. Then last night we were talking about something and he told me that if his ex wife called and wanted him back he would leave me and go back to her. I can't stop thinking about this today. I mean, what are we even doing here then? I don't want to have to live every day in fear that this chick is gonna call one day and want him back. Especially when she finds out he and I are back together. We had many many issues throughout the years while they were married and she hates me. She'd take him back JUST to spite me I have no doubt. So, should I just break things off with him now before I get even more attached to him than I am now? Help!

TL;DR- got back together with my ex. Things going good and out of the blue he says he would leave me if his wife took him back."
"My mom [40s] offered to buy a painting from her close-ish friend [F40s] who just quoted a very high price that my mom’s not willing to pay. What now?


Tl;dr: Mom asked for painting from friend - friend quoted ridiculously high price. How does she get out of it?

A bit more context: my mom requested a painting from her friend and offered to purchase it. Now, before this friend started to paint it, my mom asked her about the price, and she was told not to worry about that. 

Now a month later, this friend has completed the painting and is asking for about double the maximum amount my mom was willing to pay for it. My mom feels embarrassed and can’t think of a polite way to say no. 

My mom still wants the painting because she feels she owes it to her friend, but to me it feels like her friend is dealing in bad faith and my mom shouldn’t buy the painting at all. My mom also maintains that the main point of going to her friend was more of a gesture of support than really needing a painting made (my mom is an artist herself), so she doesn’t really want to back out entirely. 

How can she get out of this awkward situation?"
"My [30s] family lost a toddler, how to respond?


Trigger warning: baby death

My cousin's toddler drowned in a family member's swimming pool.  I'm not incredibly close to this cousin, I don't even have his phone number.  I do have his address and talk to his mom some.  I haven't directly heard from any of these people, for obvious reasons.

I feel like I need to do something, and I don't have any idea what is appropriate in this situation.  I was thinking a gift card to eat out, but who cares about that.  I was thinking a big box gift card?  A check to cover some expenses?  Flowers?  I feel like I have to say something or do something, but I have no idea what to do."
"Ended my 2 Year Relationship (28F) with my bf (29M) because of lack of intimacy.


We were together for 2 years. I have been communicating my needs so transparently to my boyfriend for all this time, specifically about the dead bedroom for the past year in total. Its destroyed my confidence in myself. I always did a full exercise to ensure I give him excuses before my anger and frustration builds up to a point where I lash out on some things.. Not a healthy solution, but was impossible for me to help it. I was agonizing over the pain and the constant rejection. I see how other people look at me, I receive a lot of attention but not from the person I want. I am only 28 and he is only 29. Having sex 2 times a month is NOT normal when we see each other 14 days a month. I have tiptoed around this conversation by doing this exercise:

1. Is there something stressing you at work/home/friends/our relationship? 
2. Is there anything you fantasize about or want to try that you are too shy to tell me? Any fetishes? I am willing to try anything 
3. The weed and alcohol must have an effect on this, please cut down? 
4. Have you been masturbating, if so I know it might be too much to ask so please cut down?  he said its not much to ask and that he would cut it down... but 6 times into this conversation this turned into ""I need you to stop masturbating for good please. Sorry but seems like the only option""
5. Are you attracted to me at all? Its ok to say no even if you think it might hurt me. Just tell me the truth.
6. Do I not clean up well? Is there something wrong with me? Please tell me so I can work on it for us. Its embarrassing I know but please tell me. 
7. I know this is too sensitive but I believe you need to see a doctor to check your hormone levels or testosterone levels
8. Do you not know or do I not make myself clear when I am in the mood? 
9. Are you bored with me or the type of sex? Want me to dress up to spice things up? 

I can not remember other points but there were more to this exercise. The answers were all negatory. Everything is ""fine"" with me and with him . But the lack of intimacy still remains unexplained? He never even tells me he loves me. He want as far as telling me that he thinks I should get a hobby or exercise to distract myself and release energy. I was offended but I tried. &amp; realized this energy can only be released if I get intimate with him. He even told me one time that he likes it when things are more subtle? but I am always subtle. I dont push too much. Sex isnt obligatory but he's never in the mood. I even went as far as telling him we only do it when ur in the mood and thats only twice a month.... He responded with ""yes of course thats when we will do it, when I am in the mood and not any other time? sometimes I prefer doing other things."" 

During the break up I asked if he thinks we should end things over this. He said no. I begged to differ. We were thinking of getting married soon and I told him people divorce over this. We cant be together. He used to tell me once he moves in with me things will pick up, but also contradicted himself when he tried to reason with me why we dont do it as often by saying ""We dont do it as much because we see each other a lot!"" but what will happen when he sees me everyday? What will happen when we have kids? what will happen when we are 40 or 60? no sex? this is only 2 years into the relationship... when I have a few outbursts out of frustration from this situation he called me toxic. which I was. Not proud of it. but he refused to see where this behaviour stems from. &amp; refuses to take responsibility for his own ""inaction"" 

He made me feel like I was a sex addict. I felt disgusting. I felt ashamed of my needs.

It was hard to walk away. But I needed to do it. I dont know what I am seeking out here, just wanted to share and get more perspective. Thanks for reading

tl;dr: Broke up with my 2 year boyfriend  for lack of sex/ lack of wanting to try to resolve this particular. Journey to heal is going to be tough. Appreciate the insight"
"I told my (22f) coworker (mid 40s m) off for asking invasive questions, now he's playing ""silent treatment""





I work with this guy I'll call Richard. He's a lot older than me and I'm pretty sure he's married but going through some midlife crisis.  He had started to ask me really personal questions. Like if I have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Questions about my sexuality (I'm openly bi) and questions about my feelings on stuff. I tried to give as boring ""blah"" answers as I could for a while. He's only do that if he caught me alone.

I didn't go to HR because I've actually been to them about something way worse, with way more evidence, in the past, and they really just pushed that under the rug. 

But two weeks ago,I snapped at Richard, and said ""I'm sick of these weird questions. Going forwards, i don't want you saying anything that you wouldn't be saying in front of (manager) or you wouldn't be saying in front of (HR rep) or you wouldn't say in front of our whole team. If it's not something you want reaching their ears, you'd best not say it to me. Understand?""

I was basically trying to subtly threaten him that  I'd tell people about what he was doing. 

And since then, he's been really petty about it. Like if I ask him a work related question, he'd say that ""oh i don't know if you'll be angry if I speak, I'll not say anything.""

Or if i ask a group something, he absolutely never speaks. 

Or if I ask when a late delivery is coming, he'd say ""I wouldn't say that in front of the boss"" and then just not answer

It's being a pain in my job, and I don't know what to do. I just want him to answer work things without being an ass

tldr - Told a coworker off for asking invasive questions . Now he is playing some dumb silent treatment game that's affecting my work"
"Suddenly realising how lonely I am at 28 years old


I [28F] am coming to the realisation that I have very few friends. I was having a look at my Facebook 'on this day' and couldn't believe how many people I used to talk with really regularly. People I don't even remember anymore. I just finished a PhD program and am currently finishing off my contact in a job where I made zero friends over two years, because I was so stressed and depressed about how my PhD was going I just didn't have the time or energy to put in the effort. So I'm now working at a job where I have no friends, just off the back of a PhD where everyone I was close with graduated long ago and we lost touch. I was talking with a friend on the phone yesterday and asked what he was doing for his birthday. He said his friends were taking him out twice! He moved overseas 4 months ago so hasn't even known these people for that long and they already seem so close. I'm the meantime, nobody has really ever done that for me. This particular friend has actually forgotten my birthday 3 times during a time we used to live together. 

I just feel like I'm suddenly very alone, ready to move onto a new chapter in my life but not knowing if it'll work out if I do. All my friends have a different group of friends that they're closer with than they are with me. I'm sick of always feeling lonely

I think I just need some reassurance that things aren't always going to be this way. Has anyone else gone from having very few friends as an adult to a lot of good friends? How did you do it?

**TL;DR** Have found myself as an adult with very few friends. Has anyone ever gone from having very few to a lot of friends as an adult? How?"
"My [38F] ex-best friend [37F] has been sleeping with my son [18M] for three months and despite me not being ok with it she won't stop seeing him.


I wasn't okay with their relationship from the start, she's known him since he was 4 for crying out loud, I have repeatedly reiterated to her that he should be out there meeting and interacting with girls his own age, and she as someone who I trusted dearly should not be betraying that trust by starting an initmate relationship with my child.

I found out indriectly when looking through his phone when he was napping after studying all night and saw the texts he and her had been exchanging with her almost always being the instigating party. Needless to say I was furious and went to speak with her immediately, she had the audacity to call me out for invading both my son's and her private life and has since declared it's none of my business. 

We've been on pretty icy terms since then and she frequently comes over to the house to hang out with him, he's taken her out spending his limited income on dinner dates with her and despite my objections he won't listen to reason. His studies have suffered as a direct result of this relationship and I'm just not comfortable with what she's doing to with my son.

**TL;DR;** : Former close friend has started an intimate relationship with my son that is having a net negative effect on his life that I am not comfortable with. How should I proceed?"
"My boyfriend [26M] had sex with me [27F] while I was sleeping last night and I don't know what to do about it


I have been dating this guy for a little over three months. The sex has been great and consensual - but last night I woke up to him thrusting inside me. I was fairly passed out, (had been drinking), and just pretended to be asleep because I was curious what else he might do knowing I was asleep. He pulled out, finished, and then rolled over and went back to sleep.  I expected him to say something about it when we woke up in the morning, but he didn't. 

I don't feel violated...I just feel weird about it. We have never discussed having sex while I'm asleep before and it just feels weird having him think that he can have sex with me while I'm passed out. I know this can be ""normal"" in relationships after communication, but I'm stuck on whether or not I should talk to him about this or let it go. 

**TLDR; My boyfriend had sex with me while I was sleeping and I'm not sure if this is violating or not.**"
"I (28F) moved out WAY early because of a dirty, inconsiderate roommate (40F). Now, they are insisting I help them clean the entire house. I refuse. What should I do?


Background:

I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. 

R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. 

Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. 

R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. 

About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time. I also feel like R feels as though she is being fair. 

Because of these feelings and my uncomfortableness there, I have been spending most of my time at my boyfriend’s house during the last 6 months. I only cook at his house also, so I don’t use the kitchen at my roommate’s house other than the fridge for storage.

I moved out 1 month and 2 weeks early, with the intention of getting someone to sublet my room. I cleaned my room very well, and I cleaned the cabinet and shelves in the kitchen that I used for storage. I cleaned the areas of the bathroom that I kept my stuff. All of this stuff is move-out levels of cleanliness.

Since I moved out, R has resigned the lease. There is one month until the end of our lease and I have paid the rent for this month while living in my new place. I have to go back to the house and pick up some cleaning supplies.

Because R is staying, I agreed to do a walkthrough with her of (what I planned to be) my areas of inhabitance... since agreeing to this walkthrough, R has texted me multiple times insisting that I help her “spring clean” the entire house (something she never did when I lived there). She believes that even areas that contain none of my stuff and that I haven’t used ever or in months are my responsibility -  Like she actually expects me to move her furniture and kitchen items and clean underneath them. I have indulged some of this in the entryway I used, because I have a dog and there was hair to clean. I also wiped the baseboards and a few other things, but I consider this to be enough. 

When I moved into the old house, only the areas I was moving into were move in ready. She’s insisting on cleaning the entire house before even showing it to anyone, and at this point I have basically decided I would rather not even try to get someone to sublet just because I don’t want to deal with her. It’s gotten to the point that she is nagging me and insisting that it’s my responsibility to split these duties with her or to hire someone and split the costs.

Here’s an actual text she sent: “I re-signed the lease with Orange so I’ve got a couple folks lined up that want to see the place (one who would like to move in sooner than later). But of course i won’t show it until the whole house has been thoroughly cleaned. I’ve continued working on it over the weekend but it still has a long way to go. Do you have an idea when you’ll be back to help with more cleaning? Alternatively I know a woman looking for cleaning work and I can hire her and we could split the cost if you prefer”

All of the areas she’s talking about cleaning are areas that were made dirty by her and her many guests. I refuse to do any more work or to pay any more money.

I am still supposed to do a walkthrough, but I feel as though she’s going to try to ask me to do excessive things and it could escalate. I have taken photos of the communal areas I cleaned “before” and I do have a list of the stuff I did.

I’m also worried she is going to try to screw me on the security deposit if I don’t help her clean her mess, because she’s still living there. 


tl;dr: I moved out early because of a dirty, inconsiderate roommate. Now that roommate is insisting I come and help clean up their mess. 

Am I unreasonable for refusing to agree to do any further cleaning? How can I communicate effectively that I feel as though my responsibilities have been met?"
"My (19)f boyfriend (20m) thinks his friends cheating on their SO's is acceptable behavior


My friend was telling me about how she's friends with a couple where the girl is cheating on the guy. I said she should tell the guy about this and she refused to because she wanted to be loyal to the girl, who she was friends with first. 

Anyway, I was ranting to my boyfriend (2yrs) about this and then he said he also wasn't sure if he'd tell a friend's SO if they were cheating. Some of his friends have girlfriends, and my BF knows them casually but isn't very close with them. He said that he really wouldn't want to lose a friend to help someone he barely knew so he'd probably keep his mouth shut. He did say that if he was close friends with both of them he'd probably say something. Now on one level I guess I understand not wanting to lose a friend, but I'm also concerned now that I know he thinks cheating is at least tolerable, if not acceptable. He says he knows what the morally right thing to do is but couldn't go through with it. I'm not close with any of his friends, but we've hung out before and if my bf was cheating on me I'd definitely want to know. 

I asked my bf if he'd still be friends with someone who was homophobic or racist and he said that as long as they were good to him, he wouldn't be super picky about his friends. But he also says he doesn't hold his friends to the same standards he  applies to himself or me. This just.... rubs me the wrong way, I guess. I don't think I could be good friends with someone who held moral views so different from mine. I'm not sure how to feel. It's not so much that I think my bf will cheat on me, but that he's okay with the concept of it and wouldn't necessarily condemn it coming from the people close to him. Is this something to worry about? Or am I overreacting?

tldr; boyfriend says he probably wouldn't tell a friend's SO if they were cheating. This makes me feel like he thinks cheating is okay. Overreaction or a red flag?"
"I (25M) am a gay man, I think I'm falling in love with a woman (27F)


Hey all, throwaway, 

&amp;#x200B;

I have considered myself gay all my life. As a teenager I struggled a lot with my sexuality. Once at university I was finally able to really show who I was. I was the president of my uni's LGBTQ club and one of the organisers of the annual LGBT Pride Parade in my country's capital.

&amp;#x200B;

I dated 2 men: James, 6 months when I was 20 (who cheated on me) and Aaron, from when I was 22-24, we lived together. He cheated on me and it was a mess and I decided to stay single for a while, I've been single for 8 months now. I occasionally check Grindr, I've had dates. Yet nobody I really like.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole life I got along better with women because, well, I never saw them as a 'potential partner' so I felt like I could speak more free to them.

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago a new manager joined our team. Her name is Cate. At first I thought she was arrogant  but we got along after both being in the same Duolingo Facebook group, ever since we chat about it a few times a week. A week ago she send me a mail of a man playing duolingo and she wrote 'Wanted  to text you this but don't have your number :(', we exchanged phone numbers and have been texting non-stop.  She knows I dated men before. Yesterday we met up and we kissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I feel very confused and unsure. I feel like such a fraud, like my life was a lie. I really like her and feel attracted to her, but I know that people will think that I am lying. I don't know what to do?"
"My coworker [F30's] lied to me [F30's] about being a single mother.


Throwaway because my coworkers use Reddit. 

This happened two days ago and it's really bothering me. I just started working at this company a few weeks ago and was trying to get to know my coworkers a little better. This coworker (C) and I got to chatting in her office about college and she brought up having kids. She talked about worrying that she isn't doing enough to get them ahead or fears that what she's doing would affect them negatively. C said the ages of her children which would have made her a teen Mom and said that she's a single mother. 

I had no reason to believe that she was lying so I told her that my mother was also a single mother. I confided in C that it's tough but definitely doable and I opened up to her since she opened up to me. Well little did I know she was lying about all of it. These kids she was talking about are her younger siblings. She was unapologetic about lying and was having the time of her life explaining to me that she fabricated all of it. She even explained to me that she was trying to push the envelope by ""being a single mother"" and seeing if I'd take the bait.

I just played along and acted like it didn't bother me. In reality, I was livid and uncomfortable seeing how she turned my life into a joke. I left feeling betrayed and vulnerable. I think the thing that really bothered me is how unapologetic she was about the situation, she didn't apologise for lying to my face and even dragged another co-worker into her office told them how I fell for her lie. Being the butt of the joke did not feel good, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

So Reddit, what can I do to stop being upset about C did to me? I feel like I might be overreacting because I felt like it was really personal.

Tl;Dr coworker told me she was a single teen Mom and I told her about my rough childhood with a single mother. Her story was a fabricated tale and was unapologetic when telling me as such."
"I (24f) really don’t like being touched by my husband(27m)


I don’t hate my husband, I just don’t like being touched or having sex with him. We’ve been married 5 years and have a 4 year old, basically ever since our child was born he gained 80 pounds and my sex drive has tanked. I still have sex with him multiple times a week because his sex drive is extremely high and I would feel like shit if I completely took it away from him.

Lately tho, I’ve been REEEAALLLYY dreading being touched by him. I don’t mind huge. But I hate when he grabs my ass, tries to suck my boobs and mostly having sex. It’s gotten to the point where I look forward to my period each month so sex is off the table for a couple days. 

I need some advice on how I should handle this.
He won’t do therapy. He doesn’t want to change his diet or workout because “he’s married and has no one to impress” (lol.) anyone ever been thru this? Obviously I wouldn’t want to divorce because of this but what other options do I have?

Any advice is welcomed at this point.

Tl;dr I hate being touched by my husband and would like advice how to overcome this."
"I [27m] am extremely confused by an encounter I had with my gf’s [29f] ex[29m] and I don’t know if I should run for the hills or what?


This is kind of a long story and I don’t know if I can do it justice through text.

So I started dating a girl about three weeks ago. We’ve been on four dates and it has gone well so far. She is divorced(-ish) with kids. I knew that from the beginning.

She does not talk about her ex(-ish) husband yet, except to say he was an overall good guy who had some personal issues that eventually led to the failure of their marriage. 

I didn’t think much of it and carried on. 

Then came Thursday morning. I had slept at her place. The next morning she told me her ex was stopping by to do something relating to the kids. She just asked me to be polite and said he would be the same.

The dude shows up and is obviously surprised to find me there. The encounter was one of the most awkward and unsettling things of my life. I don’t know if I can properly describe how it felt through text. He was fucking scary. Not in a raging, veins bulging, red faced kinda way. What made him so damn scary was that he was very clearly very angry at my presence, but he was very, very calm about it. He didn’t yell and scream, he didn’t threaten to hit me or anything. He extended his hand and wished me a good morning, but with a look in his eyes and undertone in his voice that elicited venom. It was like looking in the eyes of a cobra right before it strikes. It probably doesn’t help that he has about six inches on me and is still in ex-Army shape, so i don’t doubt he could turn me into a pretzel if he decided. And, in spite of the above, he came across as a very *smart* guy, which somehow made him just a bit scarier.

He obviously was unhappy with the situation and dipped out shortly afterward. The girl and I agreed it was an uncomfortable situation.

I saw him again last night. I was alone at a popular bar downtown. The downtown area of my city is pretty small and everyone of our age tends to congregate there, so it isn’t too unusual to run into people you know.

I was sitting at a bar and suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up and found the ex. I kinda tensed and prepared for some confrontation. Instead he asked if he could sit and buy me a beer. Not knowing what else to do I agreed.

He bought me a beer and then started to talk. He told me, in no uncertain terms, he did not like me. But then he told me it was nothing personal.

According to him the girl had not told him she was dating again; nor that I would be there when he came over. So he was blindsided. He also told me very clearly that he did. Not. Like. That I was near his kids. I had been kinda casually playing with them when he came by.

Then he said something else that kind of set off bells when he said something like he had expected her to wait until their divorce was finalized before dating. He saw a surprised look on my face I guess, because he continued something like “Guess she didn’t tell you it isn’t final yet, huh.” I told him she hadn’t, he didn’t seem surprised.

He left after that, but he told me again he didn’t like me, but it was nothing personal. And he added that it was going to be a “problem” if he found out I was alone near his kids again. Then he shook my hand and bid a good night and left.

I have no idea what to make of any of this. I like the girl, and I want to continue seeing her, but holy cow I was not ready for that kind of ex. I’d almost prefer he was the raging angry kind, because they’re at least predictable. This guy.....I have no idea what to make of it. It’s unsettling. 

What do I make of this situation? What is this guys play with the whole “clearly-enraged-but-calm-and-polite” thing? It’s  like a classy James Bond villain and I find this behavior frightening.

Run for the hills or ride it out? Advice for dealing with scary ex? Please help!


**TL;DR**: Gf’s ex is kinda terrifying in a very subtle way, and I don’t know how to handle it. I’m unsettled by our whole encounter and don’t know what to expect from him in the future. Advice?"
"I [22M] feel I have made a huge mistake by calling children's aid on my girlfriend[22F]


This whole situation is so hard for me to even try and explain.

To start, my girlfriend and I of almost a year(although we did date for 3 years from grade 7 to 10) have a child together[1 month], she has 2 [4 and 1] other children with another person.

 3 days ago we got into a fight as soon as she woke up in the morning. I had been feeding out son, who is now a month old, and I was getting a little frustrated with him because he being fussy while drinking the bottle. The fight and argument was about her and I, our problems. Etc. And she just got progressively worse with anger.

A little time goes by in our fight and her oldest son(4) did something to her middle son(1) she didn't like, so she flew inside from the balcony and screamed at him to get in his room on his bed. And stay there. And anytime after that she would yell at him to stay on his bed. During our fight, she had punched her framed diploma on the wall and shattered the glass on the floor.

Now the reason I called children's aid, was because of this incident, and because a week prior to this, I had left for a few hours to help my father with yard work, returning, her middle son(1) was already in bed. The next morning when he gets up I go in and get him and his back is bruised, part of which looked like finger marks. I confronted my girlfriend about it and she said that it was from patting him to get him to sleep. This is normal practice for us to have to pat him, but there is never enough force for there to be a brusie on his back.

The reason I feel I made a huge mistake is, I **love** this girl, I want to make a life with her and raise our child together. I don't believe she is abusive to her children. I just believe she has a lot going on in her head. The combination of the problem her and I have together and the children, on top of going through hormone swings from just giving birth is what I feel this is. I feel it's an isolated incident.

I just don't know how to continue further. As of right now, children's aid is doing an investigation and has placed the children in my car while she stays at her mother's house, allowing her to see the children when her mother is off work as she has to be supervised as of right now.

I want to make a life with this girl but I think this has gone too far. I don't know if she'll ever try to work out our difference with me so we can be a little family again.

Any advise or just someone to talk to would be helpful. I don't have much support other than my mother.

**Tldr**; I feel my girlfriend is having mental health issues and has taken it out of the children unintentionally not that she is abusive to her children. Called cps to get help, investigation is being done. But I would like to reconcile with her."
"Found out my BF [35M] has been cheating on me [35F] the entire time we've been together (5 years) with his co-worker [34F] Need advice on how to confront him and move on.


My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. I found out recently that he's been cheating on me with his co-worker for pretty much the entirety of our relationship. How I found out: My boyfriend was driving and gave me his phone to look up directions to a restaurant. An iMessage popped up from a user identified with just two initials. I saw it, and brushed it off. But during the dinner my gut was telling me something was off. Later that night, while he was sleeping, I took his phone. Spent the next two hours reading three-years worth of text messages.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; He's always carried a torch for this woman and only started dating me because he was lonely and miserable without her. It seems that she won't commit because of her kids (she's divorced). No sexual explicit texts, but I think they have fooled around and it's definitely an emotional affair. Past few months he has completely checked out of our relationship (emotionally and physically). For five years of my life, he's kept this secret from me. How do I confront him? I invaded his privacy and read this texts. I'm going to break up with him, but should I confront him first? If I'm ending this relationship, do I even need to confront him? I just want to move out, write him a letter and move on. I'm so heartbroken, hurt and devastated."
"Moving out at almost 25 should not be this much of a fight


Hey, I don't post much so this is a bit new to me. I'm doing this on my phone so I apologize for the formatting. My mother (50) has always been a bit of a helicopter parent. I have graduated college and now am a teacher with my certificate. I worked a full year last year so I believe I am ready to leave the nest. This decision was ultimately made because 1. Financially, with a roommate, I can live in my area on my salary and 2. My mother and I have been arguing a lot.

When I told my mother I am moving out with my boyfriend of 2 years, she did not react how I thought she would. (She has been telling me how she can't wait to for me to move out consistently for a year). She said she wanted me out by the end of summer so I found a place! 

I've been accused of abandoning her, been called names, haven't been ""allowed"" to donate anything because she can't let go of anything, everything about my boyfriend is suddenly ""manipulative"" and ""irresponsible"" despite him holding down a steady job and having his degree. 

She's dragging the family into how this experience is so traumatic and awful for her and she's the one instigating  all of the arguments. 

This could be a really awesome mother-daughter Bonding experience and every step of this move has been awful. I have 5 days until I'm officially moved in. How can I ease her worries? She's a good person, but she's made this whole experience garbage. I'm not perfect either and I'm trying to remain calm, but it's hard when she's screaming and giving a back handed compliment.  

Btw, I'm moving out 15 minutes away. Not out of state, not even out of the county we live in.

Any advice on how to calm my mom's nerves other than just smiling and saying ""let me take care of it"" and showing the receipts of everything that's lined up because none of that seems enough.

Tldr.: My mom is having a hard time accepting that I am moving out. How do I ease her stress?"
"My (29 F) SO (38 M) keeps making offputting jokes about my body.


We’ve been in this relationship for about a year and it’s been going in a serious direction (we’re supposed to move in together in the fall) but sex has really died off for the latter portion of the relationship. I’ve brought it up to him and he told me he just doesn’t have a very high libido and expressed that he’s self conscious about it. I was concerned that he wasn’t attracted to me this was not the case. However, he keeps making comments about my body that really make me wonder.

A couple of months back we got into an argument because I decided to go on a diet before pool season (I’m average weight for my height, 140 at 5’8 but I like to be at 135 in the summer). I tend to gain weight in my boobs which I dislike and I had mentioned I’m looking forward to having a slightly smaller chest again. I did my diet, got down to my target weight, and was feeling good about myself. I was changing in front of him and he said, “Oh nooo, your boobs are all deflated!”  I got extremely self conscious and he tried to play it off like, “I didn’t know that would offend you, you said you WANTED a smaller chest!!” I told him it hurt my feelings, especially because he never wants to have sex, and I feel distinctly unattractive to him.

Fast forward to today. The sex situation has not improved. We’re on the couch watching tv and somehow the subject of chicken comes up at which point he decides to blurt out, “Your vagina looks like chicken!” I was pretty pissed but he said he was just being dumb and it slipped out and he didn’t mean anything serious. I decided not to let it ruin our evening and we had dinner together. A couple of hours later he told me he was getting ready to head out for the night (I thought he was sleeping over). At this point it’s been like three weeks of no sexual contact and I’m salty, like, “Yeah, I guess my chicken vagina and I are on our own.” He goes, “Babe, your vagina doesn’t look like chicken. It just smells like it.” I was floored. I quietly told him he could go home now and he started laughing and telling me to take a joke, apologized a couple of times but I really wasn’t having it. He left my apartment and I, thinking I was alone, started to cry. A minute later he came back up because he forgot something. He saw me crying and told me not to make a big deal and to be an adult and stop stewing. 

I hate that he doesn’t seem to understand how much digs at my appearance get to me. I tell him he’s attractive all the time and have never criticized his body. I’ve also spoken to him about the importance of physical intimacy (he agreed to visit an endocrinologist some time back but it hasn’t happened yet) and feeling desired by my partner. He’s made some effort since then to tell me I’m pretty or that he likes my butt, but honestly digs like today stay with me much longer than any kindness. Am I being ridiculous here? How else do I even begin to approach this?? 

TLDR: dead bedroom &amp; partner keeps making stupid jokes about my body"
"My (28F) fiance (31M) has gained weight in the past year which has led to a dead bedroom. He says I need to accept the way his body is now, but I am having a difficult time finding the physical attraction to him. Our wedding is in a few weeks. Help!


When we first met a few years ago he was fit and trim. He's 5'6"" and weighed 155lbs at the time. I was very attracted to him. I also had an active gym membership and had a fit and tone body. I'm also 5'6"" and weigh around 130lbs. We used to hike, mountain bike, kayak, etc. together. Fast forward to present day, other obligations with how we spend our time means we are no longer as active as were a few years ago. Still, we have a good gym equipment selection in our basement that allows us to get a workout in. My body lost some of it's muscle tone and strength but I still weigh the same. My fiance on the other hand has gained 30-35lbs so he is around 190lbs at his height of 5'6"". He usually has 3-4 drinks of alcohol every day and loves fast food.

I'm having a tough time being physically attracted to him now to the point where it's been about 6 months since we've had sex. He says I am being shallow and that I should love him for him and not his body. He also says since I've ""let my body go"" that I shouldn't hold it against him for gaining weight. Every time I bring up the weight issue he says things like ""you just need to accept my sexy new belly"" and ""this is what happens when you turn 30, it's not my fault"" and he makes a joke or excuse out of it. He won't be serious about it.  He just doesn't seem to care at all, while I am struggling with my attraction to him. 

I don't want to go into married life with a dead bedroom. I've asked him if he is depressed and if his weight gain is a result of that and he says he is happy with his life. The only person that seems bothered by this whole thing is me. Am I really shallow for wanting him to lose weight? Since he seems so hellbent on NOT losing weight, how do I accept his body with his weight gain? I want to be intimate with him again, but at this point I feel like I would be forcing myself to do it instead of actually wanting to do it. I don't know what the solution is.

So, I am 38y-o and almost 6mnths pregnant with my first child.  I  wanted to have kids with the right person or not at all and it took some time to find that special someone to start a family with. 

My friends all had kids 5-6 years ago and since they have kids, it's like a private circle I am excluded from because "" I wouldn't understand, I don't have kids"" .  Since having kids, my friends have been solely interested in kid activities like zoo, waterparks, kids movies and such. We have not been out between adults since kids are in the picture. 

I know that having kids changes one's life and that priorities change but my bf and I want our lives to be more balanced between adult life and kid activities.  Keeping that in mind, I am still working and intend to do so until the end of my pregnancy and once the baby is here, I expect to stay at home for about 4-5 months and my partner will be staying at home for the rest of the parental leave ( about 8 months).

As I was talking to my friends about the planning, I found myself austrasized again, this time for being ""insensitive and disconnected from my child's future needs""  and that"" I will be missing on all the firsts"" stating that I shouldn't be career oriented as my job is not that important compared to motherhood. Some of my friends even implied I shouldn't have kids if I am not ready to be fully devoted to them( meaning full time mom). I explained that to me, a good parent is a happy parent and leading a life were I can still reach my full potential as an independant adult does not automatically come into conflict with motherhood. At this point, my friends are now moderately upset with my partner and I  life choices.  Even though we are not going to be bullied and shamed into having me stay at home, The resentment I have towards my friends and their constant comments are taking a toll on many years of friendship.

At this point, I have started to disengage even more from the group and I find myself being extremely sarcastic with my friends by throwing the ""I wouldn't know, I am not a parent yet"" every chance I get.

Am I really oblivious to the hole ""only parents can understand"" situation?  Or is it time to go our separate ways as I do not share the same point of view and intend to live my life differently?

Tldr: friends say they know best because they are mothers and I am only mother to be."
"I [46M] found out several months ago that my wife [43F] was having an affair and haven't confronted her because I really don't care


My wife and I are actually pretty good together in a lot of ways -- as parents, partners, co-supporters. I do love her in many ways and believe she loves me too. But the bedroom is not an area where we get along, and we just don't really talk about that aspect of our life anymore. I just don't have romantic feelings for her anymore and don't believe she has for me either.

I won't go into a ton of detail but several months ago I learned that she had been having an affair. I couldn't tell how long it had been going on (and don't know whether it still is) and I honestly don't care. She is all the things I need her to be -- a great mom, steadily employed, a good partner in all the things we need to do together. I figure if she is being discreet and responsible and safe, then if it makes her happy, fine. I highly doubt she'd ever put our marriage in danger by being indiscreet or exposing us to someone dangerous, and I KNOW she would always protect the kids so I am almost positive that whoever he is (or was) she would feel like he was a safe bet.

I know it's probably weird to some that I think this way but I have absolutely no jealousy about this and really don't care to know any more than I know.

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: My wife had (or is having) an affair and it's pretty much fine with me, as long as our family is safe."
"I think my [30F] 8 month relationship with my [30M] boyfriend is unhealthy and toxic


I've felt unappreciated and taken for granted. When I expressed these feelings to my partner, he didn't say anything and said he felt like he was in trouble. 

I feel he never considers my feelings about things, I don't feel like a priority, would turn things around on me when I would bring up topics that I was unhappy about, never took accountability for how his actions made me feel, 'didn't remember' saying things that upset me, etc.

When we went on a hike 2 weeks ago, he said there was a mosquito on my head and whacked my head. When I told him that really hurt he said ""oh it wasn't that bad.""

For ex., he asked if I wanted to go away one weekend with his friends, I asked if I could think about it and wanted a bit more information before I said yes. He got mad and said ""I want a yes person. I'll stop bringing you places. I don't understand why you don't want to go."" When I brought up that that hurt my feelings a few days later, he said he didn't remember saying it.

Or i noticed a girl was touching him at a party that I was super uncomfortable at, and I went up to him and said, ""I see you're busy with so-and-so, I'm going to head out."" and he responded with ""what, you're jealous now?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my relationship is unhealthy. Examples are: I feel he never considers my feelings about things, I don't feel like a priority, would turn things around on me when I would bring up topics that I was unhappy about, never took accountability for how his actions made me feel, 'didn't remember' saying things that upset me, etc."
"I (15f) lied to my dad (45m) about approving of / liking his girlfriend (22f)


As some background my mom walked out of our lives when I was two and my brother was a few months old. My dad was never married to her and she had a drug problem and we haven’t seen her since, so my dad has been a single parent our entire lives which has been hard sometimes because he was a foster kid so it’s just us and my aunt. My dad never really dated but recently he brought his girlfriend of one year home to meet us. He has never even mentioned before that he was seeing someone. 

Honestly this whole situation is super weird to me, she’s a nice enough girl but she’s only a couple years older than me so it’s weird as all hell and it doesn’t seem like she has ulterior motives but why else would she be into my dad. My dads a great guy, super funny, and an amazing father, but he’s also 45 and she’s 22. 

After we met her my dad asked what we thought and I told my brother to lie about it because my dad seems happier than I’ve ever seen him and love struck. So, we told my dad that we like her and think the relationship is all good. I thought the relationship would end by now but they’ve been seeing each other for almost a year and six months now and I found a ring in my dads things, and I think he might ask us if he can propose. 

I don’t want my dad to get pulled into something that might be awful for him, and I’m not comfortable with him being with a girl so close to my age either. How do I take back that I said I liked her and the relationship without blatantly saying I lied? Or is there another way to stop this proposal/relationship from going forward?

TLDR: I (15f) lied to my dad (45m) by telling him I approved and like his relationship with his girlfriend (22f). He might propose now and I don’t know how to backtrack / prevent this from happening."
"Envy is murdering my relationship with my sister-in-law


TL;DR: I strongly envy my sister-in-law (F30's, my age) and it's ruining my relationship with her.

Hey Reddit, somewhat new here, but have struggled with this issue for 13 years. 

Met my husband in 2006. First time at his house, I met his sister (my age, now mid-30s F), who I immediately thought was a gorgeous friend of his, not his sister. I've always had confidence issues (but that's another story entirely) so I immediately thought, ""Wow, I don't stand a chance with this guy."" Thankfully she's his sister. We got along pretty good after my husband and I started dating. There was some envy, though. She has remarkable natural beauty and a small frame that I had wished to have since puberty struck me and I grew significantly. I'm pretty tall and built pretty solid (thanks Dad). The biggest of my friends and I felt like an award baby giraffe at 11 where I exploded and my friends all stayed tiny. Since then I've confronted those issues, but at the time, I so envied this 5'1"", 95-lb beauty. It didn't impede my relationship with her too much for a few years.

I happily married her brother, the greatest man I've ever met, and she became my sister. Still got along pretty good. I wasn't too intimidated by her because, for my build, I was pretty slim. Had a kid over a year into my marriage and after he was born, I was unsatisfied with my body so I started working out. Got into great shape. Looked and felt amazing. Envy wasn't an issue at all. I was happy, healthy, and successful. Everything was great!

My second child was born and I experienced severe trauma. Long story short, I bled to death after the birth and was revived. Before her birth I was excited to get working out again, but instead, I let the trauma mess me up. That was over 8 years ago. It still messes me up, albeit much less so. Since then I put on 120 pounds, dealt with severe anxiety and depression, and was diagnosed with bipolar. I was a wreck. Not so much anymore, but it's still a huge insecurity for me. The obesity (stemming from emotional eating and failure to return to my old activity levels) especially makes it easy to feel like a far-less-than-desirable human being considering my husband is active and healthy. But that's not something I want advice on. I'm working on it with my therapist.

And then there's my sister-in-law. Everything in her life has gone according to her plan. She is very fit, beautiful, confident, NOT-infertile (which is actually a huge struggle for me, as I have been rendered sterile, and wanted to have a big family), and basically has it all together. Everything about her is perfect. My life has derailed and the mess is STILL getting cleaned up. So far from the life I had desired. Thank God for my husband... He is the brightest beacon in my life, and my two children are a very close second.

This causes me to feel so much envy. So much that it's begun to make me feel hostile toward her. A year ago I hurt her feelings because I said/did something that I normally wouldn't have said to ANYONE, but... Envy brought it out of me. I let it come out. I apologized, but since then, things have been strained. I don't like talking to her as stumble over my words when I speak to her, and it's really difficult not to dig to try and find less-than-flattering things about her, especially to tell other people. This isn't me. I'm pretty sun-shiny.

I have brought it up with my husband. He tells me I'm overthinking it and that she has struggles I don't know of, but she does a damn good job of hiding those things. He struggles to understand why I might feel envy, but then again, he knows her far better than I do... Still, I tend not to believe things unless I can see for myself. But I trust him implicitly... Except on this issue.

This is the only person I really struggle with. My therapist has helped me with my self-esteem, but I struggle so badly with my SIL. And I have a really hard time opening up this part of my life to my therapist. I realize this is my issue, NOT my SIL's, but I really need help on how to stop letting it dictate my relationship with her. It's strained. I really have a hard time talking to her and hearing how amazing things are for her. I don't want it to be a competition anymore. I don't want to feel like I need to BE her to be valuable. I even feel envious when my husband talks with her! I really need to confront this issue. I don't want to hate her, especially when she has done nothing to directly incite these feelings.

Thanks for the help in advance, Reddit!"
"My SO ruins birthdays


I am not sure why but every birthday, that is not his[m 28], gets ruined.  He starts an argument or throws a temper tantrum of some sort. Most recently, yesterday. His best friend [m 25] who is very generous to him and an incredible friend wanted us all to go out to dinner or for me to make a 5 course meal. I [f 32] agreed to cooking but my SO decided against it because it would be too much work. So the plan was changed to going to a restaurant. Yesterday was the day... and I had postponed a trip to celebrate with the friend. I decided to go purchase a decanter and nice bottle of scotch to go with the ""fancy"" dinner as a gift. After doing that SO decided that we would change party to Wednesday. Poor friend has birthday plans canceled on his birthday. Not to mention SO started a fight with me because he believes I'm too friendly with his friend.  He told me said friend isn't my friend at all and simply tolerates me. And he told me that he was tired of me and needed a break so he told me to leave on my trip last night... so I did. My feelings are now hurt by the friend for saying he only ""tolerates"" me and my SO for thinking that is okay...We have been together for nearly 10 years and this happens with every birthday for anyone besides him. What does reddit think about this? 

Tl;dr SO cancelled birthday for best friend and asks me to leave."
"My (22F) friend (22F) is asking for space from me over a comment I made. I feel bad but am unsure if I was out of line


I don’t really feel like I did anything wrong in this situation, I mostly just want to vent my annoyance and frustration, but maybe I am being an ass and need perspective from Internet strangers.

I (22F) have a friend named Lucy (22F) who I became friends with in college. We both graduated last year and live/work in the same city. Lucy is someone who I would describe as a bit high maintenance, but it didn’t really become an issue until the past year or so, and we butt heads every few months over it, where I feel like she’s asking too much of me and then she feels like I don’t care about her.

A few months ago, Lucy met a guy on a dating app and they went on about four or five dates. They were already arguing a lot because Lucy felt like he wasn’t texting her back quick enough or initiating plans often enough, and eventually the guy told her they were incompatible and should just be friends. This quasi breakup really upset her and she has since sworn off dating and started an intense self-growth and self-improvement initiative. 

The only reason that is relevant is because I feel like she is leaning on me a lot during this time in her life. She messages me all day long, even during work, about the new workout she’s trying, the new piercing or tattoos she’s getting, the silent retreat she’s planning, etc. I have to constantly encourage her and validate her and cheer her on. She was constantly sending me pictures of piercings or hairstyles asking me if she should get it, what did I think, should she do this/that/the other thing, should she reach out to her ‘ex’ to get ‘closure’ (they weren’t even dating!!). At one point she wanted to have a party for her and her friends, and asked me to organize it for her. It was starting to frustrate and exhaust me. And she wanted to spend a lot of time together. One weekend, we spent Friday and Saturday together, and as I was heading home, she had already messaged me asking to get breakfast in the morning. 

This has come to a head yesterday. She was messaging me throughout my work day as usual about her self-growth journey, and I was trying to be responsive while also getting my work done. She then texted this, (paraphrase): “I need you to be completely honest with me, what does my journey look like from the outside looking in? Does it look healthy? Do I seem unstable? You can be completely honest, I really want your true opinion and need some perspective”. I did not want to engage this conversation to be quite honest and sent what I thought was a neutral response, “You don’t need me to approve of or sign off on your choices, if it feels right to you than its fine”. She didn’t really respond until later, with a very lengthy paragraph about how my comment ‘rubbed her the wrong way’ and how it wasn’t ‘fair and appropriate in response to the vulnerability I was showing you. I’m very hurt and would like some space from our friendship. Maybe we can eventually have a constructive conversation on what you were trying to convey but I just wanted to let you know as not to be disingenuous’. 

I get it, I realize she was just asking me that for validation and I should have just reassured her, but I don’t think what I said was unfair or out of line and frankly, I think she needs to learn how to self-soothe. How much of a dick was I being?

TL;DR: Friend has cut me off due to a comment I made, whereas I felt I wasn’t out of line and she was being needy."
"He [29M] said he doesn't want a relationship with me [24F] but that we are exclusive


So I've been seeing this guy since Feb, we've seen eachother 1-2x per week since and met eachothers friends. About a month ago, I asked what he sees 'us' as,  I didn't ask for a relationship, I just asked 'what are we' but in a (hopefully) more tactful way.

&amp;#x200B;

He eventually spat out that he didn't want a relationship. I asked him if our current relationship is just about sex for him? He said no, he likes spending time together, dates, going out etc, and he reassured me that he 'really likes me' but also that he 'doesn't want a relationship'. I really like him too and I am not ready for a relationship exactly right now, but I guess I was assuming we would be moving in that direction. Instead of hoping and wishing he will change his mind, I just accepted it and asked if he had been seeing anyone else or sleeping with anyone else. He said no, that he spends his free time with me. So we came to an agreement that we're 'seeing' each other, and that if we start seeing anyone else or sleep with anyone else even once, it is over. I told him for me it'd have to be over if he did that, and I don't think he will, because I take up so much of his time and I doubt he has time for that. At this point, I realise that what we have is 99% a relationship anyway - though I didn't bless him with this realisation.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was to keep my options open and continue seeing him. I have since re-joined dating apps and have a date lined up for next week, he doesn't know this. I'm not ready to end it entirely with him, but I don't want him to prevent me from finding someone else. Since I have 'demoted' him from #1 in my romantic mind, I have also stopped initiating contact, and boy has he come back super hard. It's like he can tell I have pulled back. He is constantly messaging me, sending me stuff he 'thinks I'd like', asking to meet up etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is... I tried to take 'I don't want a relationship' as a firm statement and believe it, but is there any chance he might just not be ready right now? Should I continue phasing him out? He treats me so well and I really enjoy having him around, I know he feels the same for me. When I asked him 'is it ME or is it a relationship in general?' he said 'I got out of a 2 year relationship about a year ago, I don't want a relationship right now'. I'm not sure if I should go with my gut and phase it out, or keep seeing him but at a lower frequency. Last weekend I went away for the entire weekend, and he had just asked to do something that weekend, his jaw dropped to the floor when I said I wasn't available and he went into panic mode about when I'd be back. That was pretty funny.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - this guy acts like my boyfriend but doesn't want a relationship. Do I continue phasing him out and dating others, or is there a chance he might just not be ready now?"
"He (30M) physically hurts me (32F) but thinks it's a joke


I'm dating a guy who is really nice, supportive and funny. But he is pretty tall &amp; heavy (6 feet 1 and 200 pounds) and doesn't seem to realise it.
He is not the delicate type (I'm used to date skinny guys) and he often pushes me or tries to make me fall as a joke, or pinching me to scare me. I easily get bruises and now I have them all over my body, even when we cuddle he is giving me bruises by roughly hugging me or putting all his weight on my leg by mistake.

I can easily forgive the unintentional bruises like when we cuddle (even if usually guys tend to be careful not to crush you while hugging), but the intentional ""funny"" pinching or trying to make me fall as a joke is really getting on my nerves.

I keep on asking him to stop but he laughs it off. Two days ago he kept on doing it and laughing while trying to lift me up but I've already got bruises all over my legs, I got mad and asked him to be delicate and that it made me uncomfortable. Since then, he's been pretty distant and I guess he's pissed off that I implied he hurt me, thinking I accused him of something he's not. Bear in mind I was in a physically abusive relationship before and this is a sensitive subject, but he doesn't know about it.

I know he's not abusive and apparently he likes annoying and teasing girls he's with, but to me, this is stuff you do in kindergarden.

Am I wrong or even overreacting because of my past relationship?

Tl;dr: he thinks playing with me by being physically rough is funny. Am I wrong for telling him it's hurting me?"
"My [18F] boyfriend's [18M] mother [50sF] is constantly making comments about my complexion/health and weight.


For background, my BF and I have been going out for close to two years. We are both super white, though he and his mother are more tan than I am. I don't wear makeup, and have some natural dark circles under my eyes. I am a healthy weight and healthy eater and have always been (5 foot 5, 135 pounds). Throughout our relationship, pretty much since I started staying overnight occasionally at BF's house, BF's mom has been making these kind of comments:

""Did you sleep okay FUZZY\_SOCKS\_ ? You look really pale.""

""Are you sick? You look tired/pale.""

""Oh, so you're one of those dark haired Irish types."" 

For the most part, I just politely responded. (Thanks for your concern! I feel fine, thanks. I slept fine, thanks. Actually, my ancestry is kind of all over the place, etc.) However, a few months ago BF invited me on their yearly trip they take to Europe (BF is dual citizen), and I was super lucky that my family was in a financial place to accept. 

Now we have arrived, and will be here for three weeks, BF's mom has ramped things up considerably. When we first got off the plane, she said I looked ""Half dead"". That's when I knew this would be more of a problem than I thought it would. Notably, she's doing something she didn't do before, pushing food on me a lot. 

In the car from the airport, she again asked why I was so pale and asked me if I was anemic. 

The next afternoon, we were all out. She and BF got a snack, I declined as I wasn't hungry, and she proceeded to keep asking me and even almost bought my BF another one so he could ""split it with FUZZY\_SOCKS\_ "". 

Today, the last straw. I was nauseous (jet lag), so I elected to hold off on breakfast. She straight up said to me she thought I was ""starving myself"", even though we had all had a large dinner the night before. 

Later, we were doing small talk about health/weight, and I mentioned that I had lost some weight that I had put on over the last year recently. She got very concerned, told me I shouldn't try to lose any more, and that if I did I would ""look anorexic"". 

 I know she probably means well, but It's really doing a number on my self esteem to hear her say over and over that I'm too pale and imply that I'm sick. It's also driving me up the wall to have someone keep track of how much I eat. BF says his mom is just a ""worrywart"". I keep trying to be polite, but I'm not sure I can be anymore. How do I approach this? Should I talk to her? Should BF? Should I just suck it up? 

TL;DR: BF's mother keeps telling me I look pale/sick/tired and implying I don't eat enough. She means well, but It makes me feel like crap. Can/should I get her to stop? How?"
"I [24F] feel like I’m dating an immature frat boy [30M] - are my standards just too high?


Hi! Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

Basically, I’m having a hard time determining if my standards are just crazy high or if he’s very immature.

I live on my own and am on a very fixed income. I do ok but only through very strict budgeting. He makes more than 3 times what I do and lives with 4 roommates. He said he tried to live on his own but got lonely and missed having someone to talk to about his day. This isn’t me passing judgment about roommates, I’m just trying to set the scene that he literally lives with like 4 guys in a small apartment.

We began dating last November and it was sort of rocky. I thought we were just hooking up based on the fact that we weren’t going on dates, we’d just go over to each other’s places and hook up. Honestly I was genuinely surprised when he asked to be my boyfriend. This is where I discovered he’s maybe not the most considerate person on the planet.

The following month of course was Christmas and while we hadn’t been together long I wanted to get him a small gift to be nice. I planned his gift weeks in advance and gave it to him before he left to visit his family for Christmas. He told me he didn’t know what to get me, despite knowing that I’d been planning to give him something (I was up front about this so we wouldn’t have to deal with this exact awkward scenario) he didn’t get me anything. I felt pretty slighted because I’d been telling him for weeks I was planning a surprise for him and he literally gave me zero thought. He did later cook me dinner as a gift to make things up to me. This is pretty much how all gift-giving goes in our relationship. If he does remember, it’s the same day as the holiday/special occasion.


We never go on dates, and when we do, he does his best to invite his friends along. We were supposed to go to dinner and a movie last weekend but he had to work so I kept him company, no big deal he couldn’t help it. We planned to make up for it on Tuesday and I wasn’t feeling very well but was staying with him. He decided to invite a friend over in the middle of our time together so I left to recuperate at home. I’m kind of an introvert so sleeping in front a stranger wasn’t something I wanted to do while trying to recover, especially because I was coughing and they were smoking weed. We had planned to get dinner that evening but he forgot and ate without me. A lot of our plans fall through because of his “forgetting” we have plans. We really don’t go out ever, it’s always eating in and hanging out with his friends.

He also does a ton of drugs, like tonight I was trying to talk to him and he ate an entire edible. I went ahead and canceled our plans to get breakfast so that he wouldn’t “forget.” I grew up with addicts for parents. He stopped doing some of the harder drugs because he knows it makes me uncomfortable but he was doing coke at like 11 am on some days. He told me he actually “used to have a bit of a problem with it” but has allegedly stopped since we had our conversation. He never misses an opportunity to do any other sort of drug though.

He does not like to text me, however he is always on his phone when we’re together. I asked him once, since we don’t really speak during the day, if he could just text me good night. He told me he’d never been in a relationship where that was required and most nights when we’re not together I stop hearing from him at 6 pm. 

I feel like the bottom line is we’re just not that compatible. I have never felt this lonely in a relationship ever, and certainly never this needy . I don’t feel like he’s my best friend, I don’t feel like a priority. Normally I’m setting boundaries to make sure I get space. I mean I’m definitely doing that now, I’m for sure avoiding him to get some time to think about things.

He did try to invite me out with his friends tonight. The last time I was with his friends they went on a LONG rant about how fantastic coke is and I politely removed myself from the conversation because I was feeling really uncomfortable and I had to apologize for embarrassing him in front of his friends by not “exiting more normally.” Honestly they were all smoking weed, I hadn’t been part of the conversation for a while, and the smoke was bothering my cough (I’m sick).


I’m writing this while I’m sleep deprived and full of zzzquil so I apologize for any meandering. There are things about him that I love, like he’s super funny and can be very sweet. I just feel like he’s less a partner and more of a guy I’m casually seeing. I find the constant drug use super boring and unattractive, honestly. Do I wait it out to see if he matures? He really is very nice. I have talked about ending things in the past and he freaks out.


He is also (sorry NSFW) not overly generous in bed. I used to not make much of an effort because I so rarely (read: extremely rarely) get any form of foreplay, but he made a comment that made me feel extremely self conscious so now I’m extremely generous in bed and he’s so  not at all. Not giving at all. Mostly he just has a boner, humps at me, then goes in dry. About once every month and a half will he go down on me. At this point I mark it on my calendar to keep track.

TL:;DR to break up or not to break up? My boyfriend prioritizes his friends over me and is not overly considerate. Feels more like a casual fling than a partner."
"How do I [28F] get my partner [33M] to share the mental load with me?


My partner and I started dating 8 months ago. Things moved pretty quickly and he moved in with me after about 5 months. Partly because of logistical practical reasons, partly because we wanted to. 

The relationship is good for the most part. We laugh, watch movies together and I really appreciate that he always makes time to have quality one-on-one time together. 

The only problem is that I am carrying significantly more of the financial burden and do more chores around the house. 

I have a good job and am fairly well set up. The financial stuff doesn’t bother me too much. But what does bug me, is I don’t think he makes up for it by doing more around the house. 

He’s currently unemployed. Been looking for work but not having a lot of luck. But when he’s at home, I have literally no idea what he does! 

I have brought this up on several occasions. He does pull up his game for a little while and then he starts to forget/things slip again. 

Now, he doesn’t do ‘nothing’. He cooks dinner most nights. But I’d like it if he helped wash clothes, stack the dishwasher, clean the bathroom etc. 

He’ll do it (begrudgingly) if I nag. But fuck I hate nagging. I just want him to notice that we have a stack of dirty clothes and to go wash them! 

He says I just need to ask. Am I being unrealistic by expecting him to just do these things? He says all men are like this (before this relationship I had only been with women). But I feel like that’s a cop out. 

TLDR: how can I get my boyfriend to do chores without nagging?"
"Boyfriend [27M] wants to record our arguments to prove when something has/hasn't been said. I [27F] hate the idea. What now?


Together almost 4 years, living together, have a dog.

I would say that overall we have a good relationship but like any couple we do tend to bicker over little things here and there. In the last few months a new trend has been emerging in our arguments where we disagree about what has been said within the argument. He was initially saying things like ""I wish I could record our arguments so you could see what you're saying"" but this has actually progressed to him seriously suggesting we record the argument.

This last weekend we had friends over. We were introducing our dog to our friends' dog for the first time. We were a little worried about the dogs making noise as new neighbors just moved in next door and we live in a town house.

I was a little frustrated over the course of the weekend as I felt I had done the bulk of the hosting duties. On the second night friends were there, I went to bed around midnight. At around 3 AM my boyfriend comes to bed and I say ""I did everything tonight so can you take the dog out"". I was half asleep and did not say it kindly. I will also admit I did not express any hints I was frustrated until that moment, so I didn't give him a chance to do anything until then. He gets quite upset at the comment. Ultimately he actually starts recording the ensuing argument. He did ask before recording, so I was aware it was being done. I didn't really feel like I could say no.

I get very upset by this because he starts talking to me in a very cold/calculated tone like he's expecting this recording will be heard by anyone else but us two. I have parents that went through a very ugly divorce and it almost felt like this was his ammo to, I don't know, use against me? I say he's not going to have a girlfriend if he records our arguments, which was pretty uncool as it was just a threat and not productive either. I admit fault for that. I was upset. We eventually just go to bed.

In the morning he wakes up and I tell him what I said here about feeling uncomfortable about the recordings, being a bit more sensitive because of divorce stuff, and I ask him to delete them. He does delete them and apologizes, but he does still believe it wasn't inappropriate to record the argument, because, according to him, I often say he hasn't apologized or said the right thing in an argument even though he swears he has. 

I told him I feel that we are a TEAM and that we should work together in arguments to solve the issue at hand and that recording our arguments feels very ""me vs. you"" and I don't see it as productive.

On the flip side, I totally understand his perspective. It is totally possible I am grilling him for not saying sorry in arguments when he has already said he is sorry. Even if that is true, I would rather me try to consciously work on being more attentive to what is said than to record the arguments. The whole deal to me was super alarming. He doesn't seem to see the issue as much.

He did apologize for recording and I also apologized for my tone in the argument, not asking for help with hosting duties sooner and for threatening him with a breakup. Things went right back to normal and it essentially seems forgotten. I just worry that this comes back in our next argument. He apologized for upsetting me with taking the step of recording, but was adamant about feeling that it wasn't inappropriate.

I did some searching on reddit and there are other posts saying there is merit to recording conversations as it would show couples a more unbiased view of how the arguments go down. I still feel so uneasy about it. It feels really like a move two people that love each other shouldn't take. Am I being overly sensitive? 

\*\*TLDR\*\* Boyfriend wants to start recording arguments so we can be more clear about what was said. I hate the idea and feel very uncomfortable. What are other options? Am I unreasonable or is he?"
"My husband (36M) has taken up making fun of me (36F).


Husband (36M) and I (36F) have been married for almost 4 years. We have kids together. Recently he has begun pointing out my shortcomings or mistakes for the amusement of anyone around.

we have had several conversations about this in the last month - it is an ongoing issue where I feel controlled and belittled, the making fun part is new.

Example from this weekend:
We are taking his mother to the airport, stop with our 3 kids to have lunch at a Five Guys that appears to just have opened. They were removing a sign about being closed for a plumbing issue and my husband asked if we should ask if they were ready. I brushed it off in my business of getting the kids out of the car. As I come around I realize he was right - and maybe we should ask, so I say if. He immediately says something to the effect of “no we aren’t asking NOW,” in a super mocking and condescending tone. He repeats what I said, shaking his head. Then as he holds the door for his mother, he repeats what I did in a “look at what an idiot my wife is” tone. 

I mentioned it later and he didn’t say anything. We just sat in silence on the way home. He says he is sorry and he will work on it - but I have to know:

Am I blowing this out of proportion? I have no healthy marriages to compare this to.

Tl;dr husband is belittling wife, is it a big deal?"
"My [29 F] mom [60s F] reacted poorly to news of my engagement


I could really use advice on what to do. 

So, my family is conservative and same sex marriage is something they are barely okay with. As it turns out, I'm a lesbian. I'm out to my family and have been dating my SO for several years now. My mom has met my SO many times and seems to like her. My SO and I often get dinner with my parents and we help my parents around the house with various things that are harder because they are getting older.

I knew my family was only tentatively were okay with same sex relationships, but everything seemed to be going as well as possible. 

Cue me telling my mom I was engaged. She. Lost. It. She just started crying and crying and trying to guilt me into a variety of things. Some of the most dramatic crying I've ever seen - like some just died (like, she crys less at funerals). She never explicitly said she didn't want me to marry a woman, but I don't think her crying so much can only be explained by a desire for me to wear a dress at my wedding (I don't wear dresses). I was weirdly detached and unmoved by her tears at the time, but now I feel heartbroken. I was looking forward to excited wedding talk with my mom and seeing her happy on my wedding day. Now I can't picture a happy day. 

What the hell do I do? My mom's unhappy tears were completely inappropriate. She has not mentioned that incident or apologized. I have not talked weddings with her again. 

I don't know how to feel good about my wedding again or how/if I should include my mother.

tl;dr My mom cried dramatically after I told her I was going to marry my long-term, same-sex partner. I don't know how I should react/interact with my mom regarding my wedding."
"Boyfriend (25) has been hiding his friend ship with another girl for over a year.


My boyfriend (25) and I (27) have been dating for over 3 years, things have been a little rocky because we are on totally different work hours and it's been hard finding time for each other. Lately, we got in a big fight where he admitted he has been talking things over with a friend and she has been helping him. Because he never talks about getting any advice from other girls I asked who, and he refused to tell me. After a long argument, he admitted he's been talking to this girl (20?) for a year now and has never once mentioned her name. It turns out he's been hiding this for a while, a few times when he would be over and gets texts at 2 am, and I would ask joking who is even up at this hour and would get pretty defensive over it. I always just brushed it off because I have never had a reason not to trust him.   
I have tried to express that I feel it's not appropriate to be hiding this sort of friendship and I feel very betrayed and hurt by this, and he thinks I'm overreacting. If he was talking to any other friends about this I likely wouldn't mind, however, I don't understand why he hasn't even mentioned she exists or avoided talking about her. He says she just makes him feel comfortable to talk to and it's not like anything is going to happen between them.  
He has always had a huge issue with jealousy after his last long term relationship cheated on him many times, because of this I have always been extremely open with all my friends and anything her would want to know.   
Am I wrong to be upset that he has been hiding their friendship and has been confiding in her about his personal problems, if not how do I explain this to him? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl/dr: My boyfriend has been hiding a friendship with another girl where he has been confiding in her about his personal problems, am I wrong to be upset about this, and what should I do?"
"I [32F] set off time and spent money to go visit a friend [33F] in the city we both used to live in. 1 week before she says sorry she won't be there because she's going on some glitzy private jet vacation with her heiress rich party friend


I used to live in a European metropol (EM). I moved 3 years ago and now live in an American metropol. When I lived in EM, I had a best friend. To the point where we'd tell each other if we had weekend plans and couldn't hang. We'd see each other multiple times a week. It fizzled down to maybe once a week leading up to my move date, but it was definitely sad for both of us when I left. She's visited me and I've visited her a total of 3 times since. We text sparingly, neither of us are the kind to text a lot. More like we comment on each other's social media and stuff, so we stay in touch a bit. But I've always had her in the back of my mind, and it's always great when we're together. 

Since it had been a while since I last saw her, and I was going to Europe, I asked about 1 month prior if I should come visit, I said some dates that fit, she excitedly agreed, and said that we *really* need to talk about life and catch up, and I booked tickets. 

1 week before she messages me and says she won't be there those days after all. Because she's going to Vacation City. I knew right away what the deal was: this wasn't some emergency or family thing or work thing, this was some invitation to go somewhere fancy that she couldn't turn down. Her trip is right now and sure enough it's with her rich party friend who I think is a bad influence at some fancy hotel and they're posting seductive photos with Champagne in their hands, in bubble baths and flying on a private jet. My friend has described this girl as ""She doesn't work, inherited lots of money, she's like a professional party girl. She just parties and travels.” She’s obviously her main friend now, but she’s specifically said to me in the past that she has no depth. 

I don't know what to do. I think my friend is on a bad track. She's 33, hates her job, wants kids, can't find a man, spends her free time partying and travelling (I think escaping). She has a normal amount of money, is not rich. And now she just ditched me, possibly the last good influence she has in her life. All her other friends are party friends. She has said it herself, that I'm the only friend who actually cares. I’m not an heiress, but I’m doing pretty well for myself. Also note that I'm not lame and her other friends cool, I can drink Champagne in a fancy dress too, and we do that together, I just don't do it all the time. I don't know. I care about her, and I do miss her often. She's had a rough life, grew up middle class in a developing and corrupt country and made herself into a fairly successful, worldly socialite with a contagious positive energy. 

There's also that incident where a guy she was really into and had a thing with ended up going after me (I turned that down hard). That whole ordeal hurt her feelings. 

I feel a bit bad for leaving our city 3 years ago, this probably just added to her feeling that everyone abandons her. I think her life would be in a better place had I still been around. She was doing better when I lived there but now has derailed into total party-mode. She has such a hard time being vulnerable and it's just getting worse and worse. My other friends that I've introduced her to are pretty lukewarm about her,  just see her party girl exterior, but I always saw the best in her. Her perseverance, her longing for something safe, her willpower. We stayed in for a movie one night when I last visited, and then this girl who is just a party girl in everyone's eyes chose to put on a documentary about crypto. 

Meh. Is our friendship dead? Should I reach out further, if so, what should I say? I can't think of a time a friend has done something shittier to me. Let me spend $$$ and set off days from very my busy life and then ditch the whole thing for some glitz. 

**Tl;dr:** Long term long distance friend ditched my already paid for visit for a glitzy party vacation with her rich jetsetter friend. Pretty sure she is struggling. I still care about her and miss her. Should I drop her? Or, how do I communicate how much this hurt me and our friendship?"
"How To ""Break Up"" With a Friend


Let me give you some backstory. I (29F) have known this girl (30F) for about 6 years, and at some point we were pretty good friends. The first issue that happened was when she ended up coming on a family trip 4 years ago (mom, aunt, sister, and me). During the trip, pretty much all she did was whine, and didn't seem to want to do anything my family or I wanted to do, and made us feel bad for not doing what she wanted to do. Aka we are NOT compatible travel buddies. Myself (and my family) vowed to never travel with her again after that, as she made the trip pretty unpleasant. I still hung out with her a bit after that, but she would keep incessantly asking when ""our next trip"" was, and all my changing the subject never gave her a hint. In fact, that seemed to be her sole focus every time we'd meet up.


A couple years after that, my sister got married. At her request, I gave sis a list of people I'd ""like to see invited"", which included this friend (let's call her ""Jane""). Ultimately, it was not my wedding, so my sister invited my friends who she also likes, which didn't include Jane. Well when Jane found out about this, boy did she guilt trip the HELL out of me. ""Oh, I thought we were friends,"" etc etc. No matter how many times I explained it was not MY wedding or MY decision, she laid the guilt on THICK, and it was then that I decided I was over ALL the guilt trips and no longer wanted to hang out.


Problem is, she will NOT take a hint. No matter how often I'm ""busy"", she keeps asking to hang out. Thing is, I DO feel guilty. I don't think she's a bad person, and I also don't think she has many other friends, so she clings to me. I feel bad, but I've also just outgrown the friendship. Honestly, drama aside, we don't even have that much in common anymore. I don't want to be rude or mean, and I don't want to hurt her feelings... What do I do?


TL;DR I've outgrown a relationship with a guilt-tripping friend who will not take a hint that I don't want to hang out anymore, and need advice."
"I don’t know if I [19F] should proceed with this relationship with my boyfriend [33M] of seven months


I’m using a throwaway for this because I don’t know how this situation will be perceived and just don’t need this linked to my regular account in case things go crazy.

I started my freshman year of college in late August 2018. In a few weeks into September, my school had a music festival that was open to the general public. That’s where I ended up meeting my boyfriend. 

Here I’ll mention that I’m physically disabled and disfigured in quite a few ways. I was accidentally shot when I was four, and that has resulted in visible scarring and damage to my face and upper body. I had a stroke and multiple seizures as a result of that same accident, which to make a long story short, has resulted in me needing a wheelchair most of the time. I also have lupus, which started to impact my breathing seriously during my senior year of high school, and alopecia. So needless to say, I’m definitely not the most attractive person out there but, of course, ironically I catch a lot of people’s attention.

I thought my boyfriend only started speaking to me out of pity or curiosity, as many people do when they see me sitting alone, but it turns out that he was attracted to me. He told me he just graduated from the same college and he’d love to talk to me again sometime, and maybe even show me around. We exchanged numbers and social media information.

After some very amateur sleuthing, I found out that he lied to me. He was actually 32 at the time, so not a recent undergrad, and he also seemed to forget to mention that he was in the middle of a divorce. I quickly confronted him about this, and he said that he thought if he told me either one of those details, I wouldn’t be interested in him. He told me that the divorce is ugly and he just wants to give someone love again. He said I stood out, and when I told him I always do, he said he sees me differently. He loves bald girls and he loves girls in wheelchairs, and he wants someone with a youthful energy because women his age are “jaded”. We ended up having a long conversation and a heart-to-heart. It became very apparent that he is somewhat damaged and jaded himself, and was looking for something or someone who bring something meaningful back into his life again.

I’ll also take some time to tell you that I admittedly have daddy issues, as my father has been in and out of my life consistently, my mother makes it very clear that she resents me, I’ve been in and out of foster care and passed around family members my entire life, and I don’t have a lot of friends nor have I really ever had a lot of friends. I was bullied growing up. I’ve had guys ask me out and pretend to be interested in me as a joke or to virtue signal basically. I try not to show it, but I’m very lonely and depressed. So to hear him express such interest, that appeared to be genuine, in me was everything. Especially because he is handsome and appeared to be well-off.

We were “friends” before we made things official and started dating in December. Throughout the time I’ve known him, even before we started dating, he’s been kind of clingy. He also appears to be in competition with his ex-wife, always looking her up on social media and showing me what’s she’s up to in disgust, then posting about his “younger, fresher, and hotter girl” making sure she or someone close to her has a way to see it. There are some times where he shows me off and it seems more genuine, but I’m unsure these days with the amount of times he’s tried to get back at his ex. Additionally, he gets very angry with people interacting with me. I will often get stared at in public or receive backhanded compliments, which is really whatever to me at this point in life, but if we’re together, he’ll get in people’s faces and ask if there’s a problem. He’s told a few guys that they can both go outside and sort things out like men if they wish to disrespect his girl like that. I’ve told him many times that it’s not that serious and it’s more embarrassing when he does that, but he says I’m too young to understand and this is what men do for their women. He is very much into gender roles in the sense that he was to protect and provide for me and all that. He also wants sex a lot. It’s physically draining for me and I have some not so great past experiences that I don’t think I’m fully over, but he nags me and asks for it to the point where it’s just easier to give in and hope for a good time than to go back and forth. In June, he started talking about marriage, and said he wants me to seriously consider it. I told him I don’t want to be married when I’m not even 20 yet and he said not to worry about age so much.

I don’t know. To be honest, he acts creepy, the way he wants to spite his ex so bad is kind of cringeworthy and unsettling, he can be on edge for no reason, he is needy and doesn’t understand that I can’t always be physically available, and he acts much younger than 33 sometimes. However, he really does take care of me. He is always buying me gifts and flowers. For the longest time, other girls in my hall would come by when my door was open and admire all the flowers, saying their boyfriends never did anything like that for them. I’ve never had a chance to really be or feel girly, with all the issues I have; I enjoy girly things and I feel like it can compensate for the rest of my appearance. He understands this and buys me clothes, makeup, cute hats, jewelry, shoes, etc., and always compliments me on my makeup and style, saying all the other women he’s been with never put that much time or effort into themselves like I do. He has provided more consistent financial stability than anyone in my family has, coming to the rescue when I’ve had sudden visits to the hospital or bills from my college. I’ve wanted to try and give back financially to him, and he really doesn’t want me to. And even though I’ve been questioning the authenticity, it’s nice to be shown off on all his social media to his friends, family, and colleagues, and told that I’m his everything and all that. And I guess even the way he wants to have sex with me and try to make it a pleasant experience. No one has ever spoiled or fawned over me like that. No one has ever told me that I’m beautiful and worth it like he does. I don’t feel so lonely and undesirable anymore. It’s something new and so nice, and I don’t want it to stop. Maybe that’s selfish, I don’t know?

I was really contemplating if I want to continue with this relationship. There’s some draining things about it but there’s so the appreciation. This is the first relationship I’ve ever been in so I don’t know what’s normal and what’s not; I’m basing a lot of my thoughts off of what I’ve been told is normal and healthy to be honest. Maybe the draining parts are just the rough beginning patches (I really don’t want to get married though, and that is something I do not want to succumb to pressure for)? Am I seeing the whole thing with rose-colored glasses because I enjoy having positive attention for a change? I’m looking for honest insight. My aunt, who I live with, really doesn’t like him, and some of my friends think he’s cute with the gifts and posts but mostly creepy and too negative. They’re not fond of the age gap. One friend has never liked him since she found out he first lied to me, even when I explained why.

**tl;dr; I’m considering if I should continue to be in a relationship with my boyfriend; he has a lot of negative qualities that are overwhelming for me at times, but he also takes care of me and loves me in a way I never experienced. As a relationship novice, I’m seeking some more thoughts from outsiders**"
"Guy I lost my virginity to won't leave me [22/F] alone


I lost my virginity last summer to a guy I didn't know or like. I was extremely drunk.. we both were and I didn't plan on having sex with him I just let it happen and regretted it like hell. I called him the next day and asked if I had said I didn't want to do it.. just for clarity, not accusing him (though I know how this sounds of course). He started asking if there were any marks or bruises on me and just being an asshole so I said have a nice life, blocked him, and moved on. I let it go and just chalked it up to a drunken mistake. 

We go to the same school, so one time while walking past him he says ""Hi sarah"" (my name) and I ignore him. Then I see him a few more times and he tries to talk to me. He called my name and one time called me ""love"". 

Then recently I got a text from a random number one night and it was him and he said ""I think you hate me but I wanted a relationship last summer didn't you?"" I told him to fuck off for good.

Now! Turns out he's in my online class and he searched up my name on Facebook and tried to add me as a friend. Then after declining his invite he messages me and says he got a new number if I want to link up and try again. 

I honestly don't know if I should tell him to fuck off again or just block him. It's honestly getting scary and a bit frustrating that he won't leave me alone and kept my number and what not. What should I do?

TL;DR; guy I lost virginity to won't leave me the hell alone. Should I tell him off or just keep blocking him?"
"I (24F) decided to stop seeing a trans man after finding out he was transgender, and was labeled transphobic and lost several friends over it


I feel really guilty over the whole thing but I don’t think this makes me transphobic. I met this guy a couple months ago through my friends at work, he’s cute and nice, and we went out on several dates and talk all the time. He waited until last week to mention that he’s transgender and I’m honestly not too mad about him not telling me upfront, simply because I can’t imagine how nerve wracking it is trying to bring that up to someone, but I really wish I would have known beforehand. I support trans people whole heartedly but I’m just not sexually attracted to same sex genitals, and that just wouldn’t work out for me. I tried to gently tell him this and he got very angry with me, and is no longer speaking to me. My works friends are also no longer speaking to me. Several of them texted me, pretty hostile, telling me how transphobic I was since I find him attractive, and how I would still be straight if we dated. Now this is totally opinion I guess, but I don’t think so. Wouldn’t that make someone bisexual or pansexual? Which there’s nothing wrong with that, but I’m straight. I feel really bad because I’m imagining how he actually feels under the anger, and I hope my rejection doesn’t make him doubt his self worth over something he doesn’t have control over. But I just couldn’t lead someone on like that, and now I’m struggling and isolated at work. 

TL;DR wouldn’t continue dating a trans man because I feel like I’m a straight female, and was met with anger and lost friends"
"My (18M) parents dislike my SO (19F) for being ""under my league"" and having sex with me, and I don't know what to do.


Alright so, I've been dating my SO for about six months now. Right now the relationship is really serious. We clicked really early on and fell for each other quickly. Since everything was starting out great between us, I had her meet my parents about 2 months in. My parents told me they liked her and were glad I met her. They felt she was 'genuine' and 'friendly.'

A little background, my mother is super Christian, and a couple weeks after meeting my SO, my mother flat out asked me if we were having sex. When I told her yes, she got extremely angry and gave me the whole ""I've never been so disappointed in my life"" talk. During the conversation, my mom was using words like 'slut' to describe my SO. She then told me that the next time she sees my SO, she will basically tell her to stop having sex with me. I was really upset that my mom had gone from really liking my SO to basically hating her in 10min. Now for the kicker.

About a week after the confrontation with my mom, both my parents sat me down talked about my SO. I guess I'm fairly attractive since I have had pretty good luck with girls over the years. My dad opened the conversation up by talking about 'dating leagues.' He basically said she wasn't in my league and I could do better, and hinted that we should break up. The reason my dad probably said this is because my SO is part Japanese, and my dad said, a while back, that he never saw asain people as being that attractive. Mind you my parents and SO have only met once for about 2hrs at dinner. 

So atm, my parents opinion on my girlfriend are in the dumpster. I have not brought my girlfriend to see my parents since the confrontation because I fear they will low-key insult her, or my mom will yell at her about the whole sex deal. 

My girlfriend always asks when we are doing stuff near my place. I prefer not to tell her the real reason I dont want her over, so I just say there's more stuff to do by her, which is completely true. My SO has really bad anxiety and I feel telling her my parents think I should break up with her will cause her to have even worse anxiety. My solution to this problem, which is really bad, is to just never bring her over again. I am transfering to my four-year university next year which is really close to my girlfriends university, so my parents will be out of the picture.

I never thought the girl I would fall in love with would be disliked by my parents. Really, I just want to know a better solution to this problem. If there are any details you want to know, feel free to ask. Sorry for any grammar errors, on mobile.

"My stepmom [33F] wants me to forgive my abuse [52F] biological mother and tells me [21F] that it’s all my fault. Should I forgive her?


Hey! I’m really new to reddit so I’m not used to everything on here but I wanted to get some advice on what I should do. 
Sorry it’s so long as well, I felt like I needed to explain some background for this. 

I’m [21F] and I have always lived with my bio-dad [50M] until I moved out at 18. My bio-mom and bio-dad split when I was around 5 or 6. I’m not close at all to my biological mother and while I’ve tried all my life to have a normal relationship with her, I just can’t. 

Back in August of 2018 I took a trip to see my bio-mom and spend the night at her house. It was fine at first, at the beach she started talking about aliens and spirits and how the government was purposely trying to block out the sun with hers. (Pretty normal for her) and while that didn’t bother me, some of the stuff we talked about that night did. 

After dinner at her house, she randomly brought up an incident that happened 6 years prior when I told my bio-dad she gave me drugs and I didn’t want to visit her anymore. When she was going off about it, she told me I betrayed her trust and threw her under the bus. But she forgave ME. I was really upset so in retaliation I brought up some other times she had upset me or something to hurt me. 

Some of the stuff that we talked about still upset me to this day. 
There was one incident when I was 8. I spent the night at her house with a friend for 3 days straight and I left on the third night to go back home and she started texting me at 1am saying she needed a break from me and that I was a backstabber. I was pretty upset and confused it happened.

I also brought up when she would lock me in a room for hours and take my phone and text my dad pretending it was me so he wouldn’t pick me up.

There are also of incidents of her complaining I’m a horrible child and my dad was raising me wrong, that the spirits and aliens contacted her and told her what was best for us, she would tell me all the time how I can’t trust my grandparents and they were manipulative and my grandmother faked being weak to get attention.

One of the many incidents that really bothers me the most was when I was 7 in elementary school. We had to write one of those all about me pages to display for the class to read on a wall. I wrote that I live with my bio-dad, my two brothers, and my pets and not thinking I said that she was in my family but her name was at the bottom of the list. She came to my class room and read my page, and quickly left. For 3 weeks she wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. She would visit the school every Wednesday and eat lunch with my brothers and ignored me when I would try and approach them. I freaked out because my mom wasn’t talking to me. It was fixed when she showed up to my class unannounced and shouted to my teacher that I needed to fix it right away and stood there to make sure I erased what I wrote and put her name down first. Once I was already embarrassed because the whole class watched, she broke down in tears and thanked me. I was so humiliated. Even if it was my fault. I was 7 I didn’t really know any better.

Another incident happen on a Halloween, I believe I was 13 at the time. I had $30 in birthday money and she picked me up from the mall to take me to dollar tree. She asked as soon as we got there if she could borrow $20, I said sure and bought party supplies. My total ended up being $18 but I still said I would give her what was left. That wasn’t good enough. When we got back to her house she started yelling at me I’m a lair and that I can’t be trusted. After that she threw a pen and paper at me and told me to write a judge on how fat my dad was and how he ruined my life. All while she was still pacing her house yelling I ruined Halloween and I can go tell my brothers about how I ruined Halloween. I went outside and called a friend crying my eyes out and while I went out she slammed the door and locked me out. My friend called my then step-mom to get me and as she was my bio-mom came running out of the house yelling at me to get inside. (So she could lock me in the bedroom) I told her no and waited for my step-mom to get me. She threatened to call the cops, and I cried harder. My step-mom came peeling down the road and I jumped in the car traumatized as we drove away. Later two cops showed up at my house, she really did call them but she claimed I “ran way.” I had to explain that my bio-dad has full custody of me and I live with him full time. It was embarrassing to all my friends that were already at the house. I had to call her months later to “apologize for my behavior” and she was livid my dad didn’t ground me for my “stunt.”

I also couldn’t stand the whole spirit and aliens and government stuff to a certain point. (No offense to anyone who does believe in that stuff) but after being “baptized” in the ocean, and told fluoride was put in our water and toothpaste by the government to “block the sensors in our brain from talking to aliens” I just kinda got fed up with it. Cockroaches were aliens and I remember her trying to talk to them in her bathroom. 

It pissed her off I was upset with anything she had did to “parent” me. It pretty much ended with me crying and her making excuses that “parents and children always remember things different” and she was “sorry I remembered it that way” along with “parents are right” 

Whatever I did was never good enough for her. She also always blamed her problems on everyone else.

The next morning I packed up and left as soon as I could. A couple days later I drove to my bio-dads house and told him how upset I was with the trip that happened. (My dad re-married twice and he was married to my current step mom for a year at this point.) My step mom behind my back texted my bio-mom about me and what I had said about that night. My bio-mom and I fought over text that night about it. After that I pretty much ignored her. I felt like as an adult I could make the decision to just ignore it.

Fast forward to October, my bio-mom texted me ON my birthday a whole long message about how I’m a “two faced” and that I was “living my life wrong” and a whole string of things along the lines of nobody will put me in my place and I know that I made up all this stuff about her to make her look bad. At this point my bio-mom and step-mom had only been talking for 2 months. They talked about me and my step mom was on her side about all her “encouraging messages.” I blocked my bio-mom. I didn’t want to keep fighting. When I was a kid I didn’t have a choice to talk to her but as an adult I just didn’t want that stress anymore. 

Ever since October to now, my step-mom harasses me that I need to just move on and talk to her and forgive her because “I can’t choose my parents” and she tells me it’s my fault and that I hurt my bio-mom and i’s relationship and what she said about me is true. Sometimes I feel like she’s right but other times I know it’s not me and I’ve always tried to be there for my mom. It just never works out. There are too many times we’ve seen each other and it’s just ended poorly. 

Now my step-mom invites my bio-mom to all family events and even this past 4th of July she invited my bio-mom to hang out with the family and didn’t invite me. 

Should I forgive my bio-mom? I just don’t know if I should, I have years and years of emotional abuse from her and it always puts a lot of stress on me to maintain the relationship. It always made me stressed or anxious waiting for the next time she was going to yell at me. I don’t want to but part of me feels bad because she is my bio mom. 

I just don’t know if I can forgive her. 

TL;DR My current step-mom wants me to forgive my bio-mother and all her years of emotional abuse. Should I because she is my mom? Is this all my fault?"
"Friend (27m) wants to bring his girlfriend (22f) to bachelorette party



I'm getting married and my fiance Julie and I are having a pretty non traditional wedding.  We're both ladies, for the record.

We're having a forest wedding, at a large campground we'll be renting, with rather casual attire, shorter white sundresses and casual dress code for the guests. We're walking down the isle together rather than having our dads give us away. (I don't have a good relationship with my dad, and Julie's dad passed away a few years ago). For the reception, we're having a great big party in the forest, by a lake, with bonfires and a pig roast and fireworks and possibly swimming depending on the weather.

We're having mixed gender bridesmaids/bridesmen in each of our wedding parties instead of just ladies, we wanted to be able to include all our friends. And we're having a joint bachelorette party, rather than separate ones. We want to be able to party together, we don't really like the idea of bachelorette parties being like the last moment of freedom without your spouse. 

But this plan has been causing a little disagreement that I want advice on. One of our bridesmen, Andy, has a girlfriend Lisa who we're acquaintances with, but not close to at all. And she doesn't like the idea of him going to a bachelorette party with mixed genders without her. She wouldn't mind it if it was a group of all men, but she doesn't like our plan. And she wants to be included. 

And honestly Julie and I would rather not bring Lisa to our bachelorette party, when we've hung out with her at parties she's tended to get sloppy drunk and needed someone to take care of her, she's also just not a close friend and we want this to be a party of close friends. We've also already made plans with a certian number of people in mind. And if we invited one girlfriend, I think a lot of our other friends would feel like there's a double standard.

What should we do? Julie thinks we should just ""lay down the law"" with Andy and say that plus ones aren't invited to the bachelorette party. I'm worrying that would cause unnecessary drama, but I also kinda don't want to just give in and say it's cool if Lisa comes.

Thoughts?

Tldr - My fiance and I are having a bachelorette party and inviting our  friend Andy. He wants to bring his girlfriend"
"Me [28 M] and my wife [31 F] are seeing a marriage counselor who seems to favor my wife


My wife and I have been having some issues in our marriage, so we decided to see a marriage counselor. Our counselor is around our age so we get along well with her. So far we've had 6 sessions. The first 5 went well but after the last session, I realized that the counselor is super sweet and comforting to my wife but somewhat confrontational with me.

After the last session, she has me questioning my own sanity. Here's what occurred...

I told the counselor that one major issue I have with my wife is that I am always afraid she will say something politically incorrect, racist, rude, or insensitive when talking with friends or strangers. I feel like she misses social cues or doesn't simply realize what she is saying is problematic until I point it out after the fact. Below are some examples I gave.

1. My wife has a friend who is very overweight, like 250-300lbs. She came over one night and said something like ""dang, I wish I had worn something more comfortable like sweatpants"". My wife perked up and said ""I've got a pair of old stretched out sweats you could throw on."" From my wife's perspective, she thought she was being helpful to her friend, but she failed to realize that the friend is more than double her weight and could never fit in the sweats and is very self conscious. Also, adding the ""stretched out"" part only made it sound worse. The friend said ""no, I'm okay"" in a pouting kind of way and my wife said ""are you sure? I don't mind"". My wife didn't realize she said anything insensitive until I pointed it out after the friend left.

2. A few years ago when I was in grad school there was a dinner with everyone who was in my program. There were about 10 of us total and partners were invited. We were talking about places we've lived when my wife started talking about where she lived in California. She started saying how terrible the town was, how there was nothing to do, how it smells bad because of the dairies, and how like 75% of the town was Mexican. First of all, the Mexican thing was totally inappropriate anyways, but to make matters worse my colleague's husband is from Mexico. I'll never forget the look he had on his face. In this case my wife did realize what she said was inappropriate but only because everyone was like ""WTF"" or ""seriously"".

3. We were on the train a few weeks ago and were in the dining car sharing a table with another couple. They said the previous train they were on was held up due to a deer getting hit. My wife said ""oh wow, I imagine it would have been like 20x worse if it had hit a person."" Well, duh! But why say this during dinner to total strangers?

4. Also on the train... It was running late and the lady in front of us was going on a rant saying things like ""What fucking time are we supposed to be there? This is ridiculous! I am going to ask for my money back. Where the fuck are we?"" My wife perked up and said ""Well, the conductor came through about 30min ago and said we'd arrive in 2hr but you weren't paying attention."" As expected, the angry lady said ""who asked you? Mind your own goddamn business, etc."" Me, I would (and did) have kept my mouth shut because I don't want to be talking to someone who is already angry like this. Who knows if she will go off on me or throw something...

Anyways, back to the counselor... She said that ultimatums and forcing someone change their behavior without some compromise on your part never works well, so I need to meet my wife in the middle. She asked what I was willing to do to meet my wife in the middle. I explained that I don't think there is any middle ground at all. I said I just want her to stop saying inappropriate shit and just have a better sense of social cues and when to say something and when to not say something. The counselor said ""who deems what is inappropriate? You?"". I said ""perhaps in some cases, but in many other cases it's other people or just societal norms. If my wife's comments offend other people then it's no longer an 'us' problem, it's everyone's problem"".

Then she asked my wife why she does this in a really sweet voice. My wife said it's anxiety, trying to be helpful, or just unsure of what to say in certain situations. My wife said that I am introverted and sometimes don't say enough. I got sort of defensive and said ""you're right, but it's a lot harder to offend someone by saying too little.""

Then she came back to me and asked why I care so much about what my wife says to strangers. I said the strangers are a slight concern, but I'm more concerned about her saying things to friends or colleagues. I also explained that if my wife says something inappropriate and I'm with her, people will judge me because I'm married to her and it's sort of being guilty by association.

She asked again what I was willing to do to meet my wife in the middle. I told her I could lighten up a bit, but she wanted specific examples of what I was willing to do. She said that my anxiety about always needing to police my wife's behavior is my own problem and only my concern. I explained that yes, it is, but when my wife says something offensive that affects other people, it then becomes more than just my problem or her problem.

So here's where I'm confused... The counselor is acting like this is mostly my problem, or at least 50% my problem because I'm the one who is always on pins &amp; needles wondering if my wife will say something inappropriate. However, I think my wife is the problem because her comments affect other people. I could probably stop being so worried about her saying things, but she continues to say inappropriate things so every time I let my guard down she lets me down again.

What are your thoughts?

TL;DR - My wife says inappropriate things that affect other people. I feel like I am always on pins &amp; needles around her in certain situations and having to police what she says and coach her afterwards."
"Me [36M] with my wife [33F] of 5 years and she lied to me about $1,000 purchase while money is tight. I feel like I don’t know her.


Good morning y’all.  


TLDR:  Wife lies about spending for her visiting mother while bills are tight and we agreed not to spend, is still spending and I’m about to lose my shit.

Longer version:


We just had a newborn baby (first child) and things are crazy tight.  Child is healthy which is wonderful, but there’s other issues.

My wife moved here 10 years ago from another country to get away from her her mother who ruined her credit, etc. and to learn English and start anew.  She worked her butt off to get acclimated to the ways of the U.S., and has a job but makes less than half of what I do currently.


A year ago, we loaned her brothers and her mom $7,500 to start a business in which they promised repayment within a year.  We’ve seen $300.  We just bought her mom a ticket to help with the newborn and see her grandchild.  She’s been very helpful, minus the normal in-law BS.

My wife and I had agreed that we made a mistake about loaning them money and we would never do it again, even after they repay us.

MIL was supposed to bring half the money, instead we bought her $1000 round trip ticket, she brought no money and so we’ve been paying for her food etc. while here. Fair trade for her help around the house and to see the baby (the ticket makes me mad a bit but not too much).

I find a Best Buy credit card application in the mail a week before the baby is due and ask the wife if she had been going to Best Buy with her mom again (like last time she visited us 2 years ago) and that it would not be smart if she had.  My wife said no, and that was it.

Fast forward 3 weeks to yesterday and I get a bill in the mail from Best Buy for over $1,000 for an I-Pad.  My wife first tried to lie about me originally asking about opening a card but folded with the insurmountable evidence and said yes, but it’s for her moms friend and she’ll pay us back as soon as she gets back to her home country.  (Mind you that makes it $8,500 plus the $1,000 ticket).  I told her I can’t believe she would get tricked by her mom and then lie to me about it.

During the time they went out to purchase this I-Pad (which by the way, in our house we have a 10 year old HP and two 8 year old lap tops with 3 year old smart phones, we are frugal with technology), I was working 24-hour shifts to save money for the expected baby and my body is beaten up from all the hard work I’ve been doing all year.

Her mom flies back tomorrow and all I want to do is force my wife to take the I-pad back (which would likely create an obvious irreversible drama between me and MIL regardless on how it’s carried out), and basically tell my wife to tell her mom we will not be going out of country with her grandchild, nor will she be allowed to come visit again until I’m 100% sure the $7,500 is to be repaid.

During all of this they’re buying more shit from Amazon for her mom to take back (after we agreed this was a bad idea), and I’ve been treating my wife pretty shitty as a result.

The confrontation I was planning to do right before we leave for the airport tomorrow but I’m about to do it right now cuz I can’t take it anymore.  

Any advice, however harsh is welcome.  Thanks."
"I [27F] want to divorce my husband [29M] but he doesnt believe me.


Some background: I met my husband as a rebound out of my high school sweetheart relationship. Everything was super intense and we quickly fell in love. Within a year he had proposed and I accepted. We've been married for 2 years and together for 7. At some point in the relationship, without my noticing, we became best friends instead of lovers: at least on my end of things. We even stopped having intercourse about 4 years ago, not that we weren't sexually active with one another, we just weren't having intercourse. Our sexual encounters were also spaced out at maybe, a hard maybe, twice a month. We never planned having kids or furthering the relationship in any way, either.

Around 6 months ago I had a very close friend finally grow a pair and ask me why I allowed my husband to change my personality so much. I was really confused for a few weeks but then I started to realize how true this was and just how miserable I had been in the relationship. I had been morphing myself into someone else to make him happy and to allow the relationship to work. I wouldnt argue with him, I always agreed with him, I was quiet around him, I never partied and harder than a beer, the list goes on. So I started looking into things: alimony, lawyer cost, etc. and further and further down the miserable rabbit hole I fell. 

With this, I started emotionally cheating on him hard core with someone who allowed me to be myself. She was a close friend to begin with and the transition was thus easy. With her I came full circle to see that the life I was living prior with my husband was all a lie clouded by a busy schedule, the desperate want for a picket fence and 2 kids (again, not that we ever made these kind of plans), and the familial pressure to have a happy nuclear unit between us.

My husband caught us, in text messages, about a month ago. I finally came clean about everything I had been feeling for the last 6 months....and he didnt believe me.

Fast forward, Ive been living with my grandmother for the entirety of June and have told him that I want a divorce and he.... still refuses to believe me. And whenever I bring it up he flies into mental breakdown mode, that he was a fool to drive me to emotionally cheat and that he will do anything to get me back.

But I dont want to go back to living a life I was unhappy in. The entire construct of the marriage was built on guilt, peer/familial pressure, and the belief that I had ""Achieved everything in life"".

Does anyone have any advice on how I can get him to believe me? I live in Ohio which is a no fault state so if I have to I can apply for a no-fault, uncontested divorce but Im worried if I do that that he'll still try to cling onto me.

Tl;dr My husband wont believe that I want a divorce and I cant think of how to convince him I do and I dont know that he will leave me alone even through a no fault uncontested divorce. Any advice on how to convince him?"
