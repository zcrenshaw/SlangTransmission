"What's the grossest thing that's ever happened to you in this city?


Yesterday I stepped in somebody's loogie.  Mucus got all over my shoe.  I was wearing a skirt with bare legs, my shoe brushed up against my leg, and suddenly I was smeared all over with somebody's disgusting snot spit.

What about you?"
"Am I expected to say ""I'm walking here"" if I get honked at?


I'm going to be moving to NYC in a month so I was wondering if that's something that's something I'm required to say to taxis if they honk at me, or if that's just in movies."
"Do you run into people on purpose?


I was discussing this with some coworkers, otherwise super sweet normal people, that they (and I) will totally run into people who are doing inconsiderate shit like blocking walkways, staring at their phones while walking, etc. One of them said “You have to teach them!” as if it’s our duty. I’m definitely not going out of my way to crash into anyone, but I’m also not avoiding you if you’re blocking the door on the subway."
"How can I make genuine friends in NYC?


 I'm a member of [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and I go to tons of meetups but it feels more like an acquaintance level.

&amp;#x200B;

I know everyone is busy (I am too) but looking to make a few good friends in NYC. I feel like everyone is paired up with a best friend already, so it's hard to find good friends now this late in life (although I'm just almost mid-twenty). 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do to start out?"
"Quiet Restaurants and Bars Where You Can Hear Your Companions?


So tired of trying to go out to catch up with people only to have to shout and miss most of the conversation. It seems like decible levels are going up in restaurants everywhere with a mix of loud music, poor accoustical design, and ""minimalist"" decor trends where restaurants are taking anyway anything that absorbs sounds like tablecloths, carpets, cushions, and replacing everything with steel and concrete. I barely like going out anymore and a lot of my friends feel the same, having nice dinner parties in our apartments seem the better bet for actually having convos. That's my long way of asking for a list of bars and restaurants that don't shatter your ears and render conversation unintelligible."
