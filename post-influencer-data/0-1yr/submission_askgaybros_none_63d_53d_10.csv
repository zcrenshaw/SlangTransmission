"For all the young gay people out there


I am not sure this post is appropriate but here I go. 
My name is Zhran. I am 71 years old( almost a mummy) . I grew up in a small lovely village and I graduated in Krakow, in University. I am an engineer. Given the time I was born in I never made a big life being gay. My life was my work. I can't say I was sad but I wasn't happy either. Years went by and I learned to supress my sexuality. I never got married. 


My parents died, so did a lot of my comrades. And now at 71 I am all alone. At the end of my life there is noone to come knock on my door. It's a sad and lonely ending. What I am saying is that in the days like today, you can be gay and have all the things straight people do. So please, don't be like me. Don't be just another sad old man to die all alone. Find love, pursue it, be true to yourself, let people in, or you will regret it one day. 

I probably sound like an old coo-coo bird. I felt like I should turn to you like someone older with more life experience. I hope you all find love in your lives. Because a life without love is a fate worse than death."
"If you ghost someone who has a connection with you, just keep in mind that they’re probably confused and hurt by being cut out of your life without explanation. If you can’t be in someone’s life, at least have the decency to tell them why. (P.S. - Fuck you, Sam.)

"I’m 39 and WENT on my first date with a guy last night. Here’s the update that so many asked for. But first of all, holy hell guys, I’ve never felt so much genuine love and support from an online community. The comments, the messages, the good vibes, the everything. I


[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/cdi47u/im_39_and_going_on_my_first_date_with_a_guy/)

I planned the date night and tried to keep it casual yet give us opportunities to interact and talk and connect. Little bit of background…I’m divorced (from a woman) and have three kids. He’s low 30’s, in medical school, has been in some LTR’s with guys but not for a while due to dating demands.

We met up for pizza in the hip part of town (nothing like two guys in their 30’s crashing a place make it hip…but we are gay, so there’s that I guess…). Neither of us had been to this restaurant before and we were both pretty blown away by the food. The sun was blazing in the summer evening as temps were in the mid 90’s. The inside felt stuffy so we opted to eat outside where we were in the shade and caught a bit of a breeze. Gotta keep the sweating to a minimum on a first date after all! We shared a pizza and an arugula salad. Food was definitely on point. Probably good that we shared cause I would have wolfed down a whole pizza on my own otherwise.

We talked. We were both nervous…I think he was more so than me. He was a bit quiet at first but definitely became more talkative as the night went on. He’s a big movie buff and he has a big heart – most movies make him cry. Like every movie. He’s a dog guy but he’s had to leave his dog at home in another state while doing medical school. He showed me pics and I shared pics of my kids. My kids love, love, love dogs and all animals so we talked about that. I’d just taken them to a pet store last weekend to look at the animals. And we’d just watched a couple of dog-themed movies. As I told my date about the movies he enthusiastically said he’d seen them both…and cried. He’s so authentic and sweet! I love it!

After dinner we went to a nearby park. It’s a large 80 acre park…the main big park in the city where we live. I love this park. There’s just so much going on. We walked around for a bit and then settled on a bench and people watched and talked some more. We talked about coming out, how our families handled it (we both come from conservative, religious backgrounds), we talked about past relationship experience, we talked about religion and god and our beliefs in those areas. It was cool, deep stuff. I love having those kinds of conversations. Everyone has a story. And I love hearing other people’s stories and journeys. The sun was setting, there was a slight breeze, and the weather was perfect. I put my arm around him on the bench. People walked by and maybe they noticed that small gesture. Maybe not. I don’t give a damn either way.

We walked some more around the park and made our way back to my car. I asked if he wanted to get some gelato and he did. We drove back near where we started (and where his car was) and there was a gelato place across the street from the pizza place. I got cinnamon and he got mango. We shared back and forth. How fucking cute is that? We talked more. We sat at an outside table and I was leaning in, my hand often on his knee as we talked. We talked about shows we were into. He cries at Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. We gave each other our Netflix recommendations. He is tender hearted. And authentic. And that’s a great thing.

After gelato we started walking towards his car. I had a few things I wanted to say about my expectations for relationships in general, and how I felt about our night. I’ll keep that between us for now. We got to his car and he invited me to get inside. We just drove around the neighborhood the darkened residential streets with a full moon bright and blazing above. It’s a nice neighborhood. Nice homes and yards. Narrow streets. Mature trees. We wound our way back to my car. And we hugged and it was tight and close and lingering and everything I need and want in a hug. And it was nice."
"I wish Grindr had a switch that changed hookup to dates. So when you switch it to dates, everyone on your screen is ONLY looking to go on a date. I know that's what Tinder is for but Grindr has a better layout. Also I hate that everyone has ""dates"" on ""looking for"" but still only want to hookup.


"
"Word to the wise: if you see your SO on grindr without your permission... break up with him.


He's not on there for friends. He's on there to cheat. Stop lying to yourselves and accept the truth. 

I mean, sure, maybe you could work it out but why do that with someone who wants to cheat on you? I just don't get it. Too many gays get on here asking ""caught my SO on grindr. what do I do? :("" and I feel like you all _know_ what to do but don't want to accept the answer. Well, here's your confirmation, break up with them. The end."
"UPDATE: Advice please. I'm a man in a straight marriage with kids, but now realizing I'm definitely not straight.


First I just want to say thank you to all the people who reached out with helpful advice and support from my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/c83bwa/advice_please_im_a_man_in_a_straight_marriage/). In particular a few people were so helpful in sharing their own stories.

Three new developments in my journey:

1) I think I'm just gay. Yeah I get that labels don't do much, but I think it helps me realize *who I am*.

2) My wife and I have decided to seek counseling. We found a counselor who does marriage stuff and a ton of mixed orientation marriage counseling. If nothing else it will give us more information to come to whatever decision.


More recently we have been speaking and my wife said she would possibly be open to the idea of an ethical non monogamous marriage but that it would come with sacrifices for both of us (duh). She also at one point begged me not to leave. That hurt a lot. Not only because I do love her as a person and I could see the hurt I was causing, but also see all the future plans she had for us and our family potentially crumbling. 

She is scared, hurting, and somewhat desperate to keep us together. All things I completely understand. All things that make me feel like complete dog shit.


We have started actively seeking a different city to live in. This way, if we are together with an ethical non monogamous marriage, or if we are separated and I'm with a man, our kids are less likely to get shit from it. Also we will be less likely to be judged.


At least one of my professional partners is homophobic, if only casually, and I just cannot see my self being in this city while being out. I have a non compete contract as well, so I can't work for someone else.


3) I recently went on a vacation with a bunch of guys back from my college years. Don't get your hopes up - I was the only gayboy there. However my straight best friend of 30 + years came on the trip as well. While there I came out to him. His reaction was better than I could have ever hoped for. Told me that he loved me and supported me 100%. It was the first time I had told anyone other than my wife that I might be anything other than straight. Having such a positive reaction from him was so liberating. I felt so free for the next 48 hours that it was like I could just sing from the mountain tops. It made me realize if I'm ever out publicly that I can do it. Yeah some people will have really bad reactions, but for me the positivity of the good ones is enough to off set it (I hope).


Anyhow thanks again. We will see where this crazy ass journey takes me."
"I’m 39 and going on my first date with a guy tonight. Here’s to new beginnings! I guess I’m just asking for good vibes. I just want it to be a good experience for both of us, regardless of where it leads.

"You all were right about my scum ex boyfriend


About a month ago I caught my boyfriend on Grindr TWICE in the SAME WEEK. We were supposedly in an exclusive relationship. When I called him out on it, he ended up gaslighting me, yelling at me, and breaking up with me. I was so devastated and hurt.

Well, about a week after that we talked it out and got back together. During our talk we emphasized again that it would be an exclusive relationship.

Today I caught him on Grindr. I can’t even say I was shocked. So, I messaged him with my blank profile and asked if he was looking to hook up and he said he was open. 

I’m done. I’m so done. I’m MAD. You all were right. When this happened the first time a month ago, you all told me to leave him, forget him and move on. And you all were right. Why did I give him a second chance?

Worst of all, I’m ashamed. I’m ashamed of myself for putting up with this. I feel like a fool who believed lies from a man who only knows how to lie, who never loved me, who was never honest or sincere about loving me. I’m a fool.

I’m not calling him out on it this time. I’m just breaking up with him. Via text. Because apparently that’s how deep our relationship was."

"Single after nearly 20 years


My partner and I met in January 2003 and have been together ever since. I was 20, he was 19. We've been together through university, through multiple births/deaths/marriages, through 5 house moves, joint home ownership, watching and helping each other achieve goals and dreams but now its over.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently I'm not ambitious enough anymore. He's has a successful public sector career and a budding political career; I've had a 15 year career in international management and I'm now the Director of my own company. We lived in a 2-floor penthouse flat overlooking a park in the city and never had much to worry about. Two months ago I remarked that finally it felt like we could stop working so hard for a while and enjoy what we'd achieved. He's 35 and I'm 36 - 37 this year - and I thought we'd done enough hard work to focus instead on the more meaningful parts of our lives - spending time with friends and family; finally getting a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Six weeks later and I'm in a 1 bed rental flat with all my savings spent on furniture and looking at a world I don't know how to cope with. The last time I was single Facebook hadn't been invented; let alone Grindr.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently me saying that I thought we could slow down was the same as saying I wanted to retire. He says that he's too young and still has things in his career he wants to achieve, I said that I've never not stopping him doing that but what use is having money and having the latest stuff if you don't have any friends to share it with or proper relationships with your family? He says I never make decisions anymore for myself, I say that's because all the decisions had to be made to further his career and I've sacrificed everything I had to ""our"" goals. He said I spent too much time socialising, I said that if I didn't we wouldn't know anyone as he never gets involved with anyone outside of his work. Apart from my business I own nothing tangible. For tax purposes I gave my stake in our mortgage a few years ago; and then by the time The last time we moved house and went to renew the mortgage and I'd just started my business so couldn't go in on the mortgage we moved last time I was self employed and couldn't go in on the mortgage; never seemed like that would be a problem. We bought new furniture when we moved and I gave all my old stuff to charity so I had nothing when I had to move out. What money was mine alone I've had to spend on setting myself back up again. I was lucky enough that I had savings to do that, but they're gone now and I'm looking at starting my life from scratch again alone.

&amp;#x200B;

We never got married. We got engaged 8 years ago but he kept wanting to put off actually getting married until the next stretch goal he'd come up with was met; first off he was over 30, then we had to work in the same city, then he needed to be  and then the one after that, and then the one after that. I would have went to the ends of the earth with him, all I wanted in return was a husband and a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise I'm coming across as a Little Lord Fauntleroy here and I'm hardly destitute but I'm devastated; the future I thought I was making all these sacrifices for is gone and looking back now I'm not sure if it was ever really there. I think he would have kept me going with the marriage delays for years until I finally gave in and stopped talking about it. I don't know what to do with myself now. I feel angry and lost and I don't know how to go on from here."
"Why do y'all act like you have to hook up?


I'm not addressing this to everyone. If you feel like hopping on Grindr for some Rent-A-Dick and you're living your best life with handsome strangers, by all means keep up the good work.

But you don't **have** to if you **want** to. I just feel like there's a growing number of young dudes who are forcing themselves to hook up when they're not ready. 

We joke, but the amount of young guys (some virgins, some just getting out there for the first time) that come on this subreddit with little to no understanding of the health/safety precautions of sex is staggering. Then there's the guys who come on here asking if they should get their back blown out by some old man because they desperately want to be sexually active. 

Then there's the, ""I just sucked 5 dicks this week and I feel like I need to sanitize every molecule of my body every time I do it. How can I get over this?"" You get over it by not doing that. You don't like it, so stop. Take it from a bitch who *knows* -- forcing yourself to have sex with people that you do not trust is not going to help you foster healthy sexual relationships down the line.

Just... if you're going to hook up at least try to do some homework first. Maybe coming to this subreddit is a good start. And please don't go out there forcing yourself to have sex with strangers when you know you don't want to and you're really only doing it because you think it's expected of you."
"Gays who send messages every hour to someone who has continuously ignored you on grindr... Why do you keep doing it?


I'm genuinely trying to understand the thought process of gays who don't know how to take a hint. Do you seriously think spamming someone with messages will make them suddenly want to talk to you? 

It's funny because I've had this happen to me a lot but yesterday a guy who I find attractive did it and it immediately turned me off of him. I wasn't even intentionally ignoring him, I was just busy at the time but he went and ruined it for himself by spamming messages. These are the spam people who probably gasp when someone blocks them lmao"
"Went to my first Gay Bar and...


It was awesome, I went with my best who is actually the first person I told that I was gay.

At first it was so overwhelming, I've never been exposed to something like this before. But after a couple of Coronas I unhinged. Everywhere I looked there were gorgeous men. From the bartenders to the shirtless dude dancing in tbe middle of the dance floor. 

I was very flattered because I received a lot of stares and men kept dancing nearby to get my attention. However, I'm like a scientist when it comes to first experiences on anything. I went and observed, analyzed, and took mental notes. So when I return I'll be much more aware and know the do's and don'ts.

I was so happy seeing men just being comfortable with who they are and having fun. I can't wait to go back."

"Just want to share my first openly gay day after having a tough time in the closet for a while


Didn't know any other place to share this, so I'm just gonna do that here.

Coming from a conservative Muslim family (Conservative from a western point of view, but moderate from a Muslim point of view), I always had problems regarding my sexuality. I'm 17 and will be 18 in few months. I always denied being gay and tried my whole life convincing myself that I'm straight and that I'm living a straight life, I thought maybe when I grow older I will become attracted to the opposite sex, but none from that happened. I had a very hard time, depression, suicidal thoughts and in general many mental health problems in the last 3 years where I started to realize I'm gay. For the first 2.5 years, it didn't have that much of an impact and I managed somehow to keep my distance from 'gay stuff' while praying to Allah in order to save me from this 'disease'. Everything got worse about 6 months ago where I couldn't deny being gay anymore, and I wanted to come in terms with that. But that was really hard, especially after seeing how people from my community and from my home country think about the whole LGBT community it just made me sick, made me want to die because I was born like this, I always asked myself and God why... JUST WHY!? why would God create LGBT people if it's a 'sin'? I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts (I never seriously thought about taking my own life, I believed back then that only God is allowed to take someone's life and I have no right to do that, but I was thinking about what would happen if I did that). This continued for about 2-3 months, it got better with time as i got the courage and started opening up to my closest female friend, after that to a close teacher to me. Luckily, I was born and live in a very gay-friendly western country. With the time, I got exposed to LGBT Muslims. Honestly, they helped me with my issues but I never really found a real solution to the whole thing, but LGBT Muslims are imo very friendly and in general decent people who sadly are mostly rejected from their communities.

Shortly after that, I became less and less religious until I left the religion completely(there were a lot of other reasons other than being gay that made me stop believing in it), believing in a Pro-LGBT Islam was a very hard thing to do, it was like creating a new Islam that fits my lifestyle, I felt like I'm making Islam something it isn't, namely Pro-LGBT. I still have deep respect for gay Muslim who still identify and believe in the religion even though in my opinion they are creating a new sect in the religion. I'm an Agnostic Deist right now, still open to religion in general.

Today, after all the shit I went through for months, I attended a gay event with a gay friend of mine for the first time. The freedom, being openly gay, wearing a rainbow Lanyard felt amazing and awesome. I have always loved being honest to myself, to others and that made me feel better, proud and confident of my own identity. I don't hate myself anymore, I'm proud of myself. I finally got to experience this feeling that was a mystery for me when I used to be conflicted. Today was a very important day of my life and I will never forget it!

I can't wait until I get the courage and come out to my parents and be truly honest with everyone, I hate being in the closet, it's not like they would hurt me or anything but it's better to be safe than sorry. You guys are really awesome, I'm very glad that today we have a lot of communities like this, even in real life. Thanks everyone!"
"26 - Gay, Virgin, Never Dated, Few Friends, Raised in a Super Conservative Religious Group - Sheltered, Living w/ Family Who Will Eventually Reject Me, As Per The Religion's Rules. Need Resources.


Hey all, I'm new here. I'm pretty fucking lost. I'm scattered and confused and don't know where to begin. Guess I'll give you guys a bit of my background.



I was raised in a hyper conservative religion. Sex before marriage could get you shunned by family and friends - and I mean *really* shunned. If someone is excommunicated, they can be kicked out of their parents house and never spoken to again by them, assuming they don't rejoin the religion. Fuck, even things like swearing (guilty), distasteful jokes and criticism of the religion / officials within the religion could get you thrown out on the street. I grew up incredibly sheltered and haven't come out to anyone but my therapist. I'm just now starting to make friends outside the religion. I didn't know how to make friends until recently because I was automatically considered a friend by people in the religion (it's kind of a cult)... And I'm 26 years old.


I've never dated anyone, never had a sexual experience, never been open about my sexuality - none of it. I feel like I'm a high school freshman who's been in a coma for 12 years. 



I'm pretty fucking lost right now. I work for a good company, but I don't make much money... Because of my background, I wasn't allowed to go to college. I haven't been able to move out on my own yet. I still want to keep my family, but that may be impossible at this point... I have health problems, so they really help me with my expenses. That would likely go away if it was discovered that I didn't believe in the religion anymore. 


I have 1 friend who I've reconnected with who left the religion years ago. He's the only one I'm honest and open with. I still haven't come out to him, but I really want to. I think he'd understand. I'd be devastated if he didn't, though, so I'm really scared. This religion really, really fucks your head up, so both of us are pretty broken. I wouldn't hold it against him if he had some parts of himself that were still homophobic. I know he wouldn't say anything mean. I'm positive he'd say he supports me... but I'm worried he'd distance himself from me over time. Since he's my only friend, I give him a lot of attention and I don't want him to misunderstand my motives. He's like a brother to me. He's the only person I talk to about my personal problems because he's the only person I *can* talk to. He knows me better than anyone else. That's why I can't lose him. 


Beyond that, I don't know how to connect with other people romantically. I want to meet someone. I know it takes time... I'm not really into casual sex. I tried to do something with someone once and I got really anxious. Suffice it to say it didn't work out and I never wanted to go that route again, even though I'm a heavily repressed guy who wants to have sex. 


It's not like I'm bad looking. I could definitely get sex if I wanted. I'm fit and consider myself to be fairly decent looking. I've had lots of girls show interest in me, but as you're probably aware, I'm not very interested in girls. But like I said, this isn't something that I want to do. It was too stressful the first and last time I tried to hook up with another guy. 

I honestly have no idea what to do. Everything I've got going on is so fucking complicated. I wish I knew where to start. I see a therapist who's helped me a lot. I'm gonna try going back to school... Surprisingly, my parents are okay with it, despite the religion being totally anti-college... But that's a long term plan. I feel like I need to do something within the next year to get myself some independence. I can't live with my family any longer than a year. I love them, but they're so overbearing and controlling - not because they're naturally like that, but because the religion forces them to be. In fact, i'd say they're a lot better than most parents in this religion. They're good people. If they weren't part of this religion, I'd be a lot closer to them and I think they would've been great parents. But the religion hijacked the parenting and told them how to raise me. It fucked me up. 

My sister's got a pretty successful small business, but she's also part of this religion. I guess I could try asking her for help, but I don't know if she's able to do anything for me. She has a handful of employees, but I don't think there's anything that I could do for her. 


I don't know where to go for help or resources. My therapist can only do so much for me. I feel like I need more help, but I don't know where to go at this point. Sorry that this post is ridiculously scattered and needlessly convoluted. My mind is all over the place right now. I'm a fucking mess."
"I finally did it!


I was laying in bed with my best friend and I decided to put my head on his shoulder and my hand on his chest. Yes he was okay with it he held me back. I thought I would cuddle with him because he's leaving for three days to go to a funeral. Sometimes the warmth of a friend helps.

What do you guys think do you agree?"
"Never Be Friends With Your Crush


I walked him home after he picked me up from my closing shift at night after we just chilled for 3 hours. 
He hugs me tight and tries to walk me home even though we just got to his apartment but I just decline and be on my way. 
I walk home alone at 2am and all I can think is ""what the fuck am I doing"" 
No matter what kind of hope you have, smash that shit in the trash where it belongs lmfao. 
You guys can shit on me for falling in love with a straight guy like every other closeted dude but I didn't know and I really thought I had a chance for once. This guy texts/calls me every morning and night to check up on me. How am I supposed to feel when he's straight as fuck (and he's for sure not even close to being bi) and he does this kinda bs?
I went to sleep at 3-4am when he fell asleep and stopped texting and I just randomly woke up at 8am and for some reason, hes still all that's on my mind. 

tldr: i'm another closeted dumb fuck adding onto the 78965668 posts about the same cliche"
"Feeling very appreciative of my good straight friend.


He’s one of a kind. We’re such similar people in the way we think and perceive the world around us, but we could hardly be more different demographically. We learn from each other. We’ve worked together for three years now, and we always had this connection because our dispositions are always the same. There is no judgement whatsoever in our friendship, and that’s a beautiful thing. We always have really deep, philosophical conversations. We both appreciate the arts, and he has such an affinity for some obscure, cool things. I love that we can be our raw selves around each other, talking about a hookup from the night before or just processing life and life events in general. Once we were out of town for a work event at a hotel, and he took a girl back to his room from the bar. Next thing I know he’s banging on my door for a condom, and we’re both laughing our asses off because he’s already half undressed in the middle of this public hallway haha. Nothing is off limits, and I think it’s because we have similar views on life and humanity. We’re both very empathetic people, and we see a lot of beauty and tragedy in life.

Once a month or so, we’ll go on these “dates” together where we’ll dress up a bit, go to a nice dinner, catch a movie and end the night with wine and dessert somewhere. I say date not to imply anything romantic but I can’t really describe it as anything else, they’re just really nice evenings. He’s a handsome guy - like he really hit the genetic lottery - and he pretty intentionally plays into the perception from other people that we’re on an actual romantic date when we’re out and about together which I think is sweet. I don’t have a lot of friends that I can just breathe freely around, and he makes an effort to make me feel seen and comfortable in our friendship. 

He just sent me a post on Instagram that says “Knowing you has been important for me. I’ve learned a lot just by watching you exist. You’ve made me better. Thank you for being exactly who you are”. It catalyzed me writing this because it was so sweet and affirming for how I feel about our friendship. That guy is going to be standing next to me at my wedding and shit like that. I’m just having a realization of how much he means to me and felt inclined to share."
