I am currently in university right now and I consider myself pretty social. I am 5'5, 5'6 on a good day, and I struggle with my height. Whenever I go out to bars or parties and I see a taller man, it crushes my confidence to the point where I feel unworthy of say a pretty girl. Has anyone here dealt with this and how did you overcome it?"

"Those of you who have found the one after years of singlehood and are in a happy long-term relationship, how did it happen?


So I just caught up with yesterday's post about missing being in a relationship, and I relate to that so much. I should have just stayed on the meme and pet subs because now I am fucking depressed. Just turned 30 and have been single for 4 years now. I'm sure this has been asked here before, but I need someone to actually reply to me and tell me it's going to be okay. And that there is hope. "
"How do people treat you when they find out what you do or where you work?


Have you ever noticed a shift in how people treat/perceive you after they find out what you do or where you work? 

I've had conversations with people where they had a neutral demeanor and then they find out what I do and they become noticeably friendlier, more attentive or just out right ask for a job. 

Do you typically have this experience?"

So I’m 21 and talking to a 21 year old woman. She’s perfect in every single way except the only problem is I don’t find her attractive. She definitely isn’t ugly though. Would you ever date a perfect woman who isn’t ugly or attractive? Why or why not?"
"How do you deal with loneliness?


I'm 26. I'm doing the things I want to be doing with my life, I have a good job I enjoy and worked to get, I workout, I read and improve myself and have a lot of interests and future goals.

 I want someone to love and care for and who wants to spend time with me. I'm sick of doing this all alone and want someone to share the experience with. But it's so hard to meet women. The few I so meet never seem to like me as I am out expect me to be someone I'm not (I'm tall and black and let's just say I don't fit the stereotype). I get plenty of attention and matches on tinder for my looks but ultimately I just can't seem to find anyone I connect with. I find it quite daunting to think I might be alone for many years to come. 

My question is how do you guys deal with being single for long periods of time. I already have plenty going on and lots of ambitions and hobbies. But I barely get any physical or emotional connections with women and It just doesn't seem like a good quality of life."
"How to emotionally support a new boyfriend?


 

Hi everyone,

Wondering  how I can emotionally support a new boyfriend (less than a month  dating) with loss. I don't want to get all therapist-y on him, offer  unsolicited advice to him or emasculate him, but I do want him to know I  care and hopefully he feels comfortable opening up to me. If not that  is cool too, I just want him to know I'm there because the emotional  connection takes time to build and we're not there yet. Here are some  things I was thinking of: ""Do you want to talk about it?"", ""If you need  to talk or vent, I'm here"", or ""How can I support you?""

Thanks for your thoughts."

"[serious] What is masculinity without the toxic elements?


As someone male presenting, born male, I’ve been wrestling with this a lot lately, specifically, what is masculinity when you’ve taken all of the toxic elements out of it? What does it mean to be a man/dude/guy today? How do you guys “feel” like a man? 

My girlfriend/partner/so says she feels being feminine is about being nurturing, and she says being a guy is about being protective, but that is from her point of view, in regards to her relationship with masculinity and how she experiences masculinity from guys. 

What do you guys think?"

"In your opinion, how easy is it for feminine men to have male friends?


A common trend that I have seen is that feminine men tend to mostly have female friends. I wonder why that is if I am honest.

So, men of Reddit, would you ever be friends with a guy who is feminine? Do you think those sorts of friendships are possible?"
