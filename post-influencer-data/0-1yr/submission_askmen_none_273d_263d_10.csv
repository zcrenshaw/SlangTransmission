"Where do y'all keep your cell phone while out and about?


I tend to keep mine in the back pocket of my jeans or the inside pocket of my jacket, if it's that kind of weather, but for some reason I got to thinking about where other people put their cell phone and now I'm curious"
"How have you made new friends as an adult outside of work?


I’m a 25m living in a  we area of the country. Aside from the few work acquaintances I’ve made, and my SO who I moved across the country for, it’s been pretty hard getting out and meeting new people.

When you’re younger and in school it’s easier to make friends because you’re constantly surrounded by people in a social situation.

What are some ways you’ve met people or made new friends as an adult?"

"When am I gonna be back up on my feet again?


My long time girlfriend broke up with me about 4 months ago, she was my first serious long-term relationship and it left me real fucked up. It still lurks in the back of my mind but I do everything I can to not think about it, for the most part it works and i’m in a relatively better mental state now. 

Since then, i’ve had next to no interest in girls. It’s not that I don’t find them attractive anymore, I literally just couldn’t care to put any sort of effort into getting to know/getting close/forming a relationship with a girl. It seems like a waste of time and effort (maybe it is?). I don’t know, but it hasn’t gone away and it’s got me pretty down lately. I guess i’m just wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. I wana get back out there and find a girl, I really do, but I don’t know how to cope "
"Fellow men of reddit, I'm aware this gets brought up a lot but I just got a compliment today which completely threw me off. So when was the last time you got a compliment about yourself?


Little context. I was at work (fast food place) we were about to close and we got one more customer right before, and as I handed out her food she told me I have a really nice voice and I should consider doing radio. (Ignoring the fact that she may have been implying I'm ugly lol) completely caught me off guard. Couldn't help smiling. I told my girlfriend I was so excited and she didn't seem to understand my excitement lol. 
 So when was the last time you got a compliment and how long did you hang onto it? Because I'll probably think about this for months."

"How do you know when you're ready for a relationship again, after being in a really bad place in life?


I'll probably try posting to Askwomen as well for the female perspective, but here goes.

I'm 24 years old, a dude, and I haven't been in any sort of relationship for maybe 4 to 5 years now, but I would love to have that deep emotional/physical connection again. I was just in a really bad place for a long time. Fell in with the wrong crowd, did all the wrong things. That sort of thing. I've also battled years of mental illness. I just reached a point where I could barely handle in my life, even the smallest things, like just taking care of myself, so a relationship was the least of my worries.

In the past year, maybe year and a half, I have finally pulled my head out of my ass. It's been hard, like really really hard, uphill battle kicking &amp; screaming kinda hard. I am where I am right now, all thanks to how supportive my family has been. Especially, my mom.

I feel like I've done a lot, but as I'm trying to type it out, it all feels like very little; even though, I know I've made huge strides.

I've seen the doctor/psychologist/psychiatrist a crazy amount of times in the past year, all just to try to find the perfect medications for me. Honestly, I feel the most mentally sound right now than I ever have in my whole life. My mom can attest to that, she always tells me how she thought I was going to kill her when I first moved in with her and that I acted like a psychopath. I knew I was bad, but I didn't realize I was THAT bad. Her outer perspective still shocks me.

I used to live like a hermit, even when I knew people, but I cut out every bad influence in my life when I moved in with my mom. The only positive friends that I still had, lived hundreds of miles away from me since I moved. In the past year, I now have a very small friend group who are all(for the most part) really good influences. We play D&amp;D together almost weekly, so that means I'm getting out of the house weekly!

Now for the biggest thing I've accomplished all year! Drum roll please! Jk...That would be way to corny...

I just finished my first semester in college!!! This is truly something that I thought I would never do. I was always way too frightened and got insane anxiety just thinking about it. I always psyched myself out, but not this time! On-wards, to the next semester!

I'm really off-topic, but I wanted to somewhat paint a picture of my current situation.

I feel like I've done so many positive things, but I guess it's just a few things that just took a really long time to sort out. 

I want to get back into dating, but I don't know if I'm ready or if I'm even remotely appealing in my current situation. Maybe, I'm jumping the gun here and should wait even longer. I'm not even sure if I even know how to properly date, considering most of my experience lies in random hookups while fucked up. The only serious relationships I've ever had burned me bad, but I was dating people that were in similar situations(emotionally/mentally) like I was, so I can't really blame them.

I'm at a loss on how to move forward or if I even should try. Then there's all the usual insecurities that everyone has, that also nags me in the back of my mind. The usual: Am I good enough, Am I fat, Am I even worth it, Am I ready, What do I even have to offer, how should I talk, how should I look, yada yada yada.....

I know, I know. I'm overthinking everything. Anyway, rant over."

"How can I talk to my best friend about not being able to go to her wedding?


 

A couple months ago, my best friend asked me to be her bridesmaid at her wedding next summer but as much as I'd love to, I told her I couldn't promise anything yet because I have a very important exam the same month and the exam date hasn't been announced yet. She understood it because my future career depends on it.

The other day I found out the exam will be before the wedding.. I was hoping it wasn't.

Flying for her wedding would cost at least $2,000 (she's having a wedding abroad.) and I realised that I can't pay for it at the moment. In the meantime, my family is planning to spend summer in Europe and only because they will pay for me, I'm thinking of joining them after the exam is finished. If I had enough money, I'd definitely choose my friend over my family, but they will only sponsor me for family time together.

When I talked to her last time, she was pretty upset two of her bridesmaids couldn't make it. One gave her (she said) some bs excuses while the other simply told her she couldn't because of time, distance and money. My friend appreciated the honesty and understood the situation.

My friend obviously deserves to know the truth yet I don't want to hurt her feelings.. And I know for sure that she has no way of finding out about the exam date. Is it bad if I just lie to her saying that the exam will be after her wedding so I need to focus on my studies and therefore I can't make it? Or should I just tell her that I don't have money that I thought I would?? I'm afraid telling her the truth will sound like an excuse to her because she knows I usually have money and going to Europe costs as much."

"Socially Awkward to Desirable Man? [Serious]


So, I'm trying to figure out how some of my female friends view me. I'm socially awkward, so I have a little trouble figuring people out, and how they view me. I'm fairly sure I sit somewhere on the spectrum lol.

A few years ago, I made the decision to try to turn myself into the best man I could be. I wasn't in shape, I didn't have much going for me, and I never had a relationship. I felt like something was wrong with me. This wasn't really a bad thing. It help me realize that my life would be better (and easier) if I worked on bettering myself. I made the decision to start working on myself in every aspect of my life. I believed that by working on myself in all aspects of my life, that maybe one day I could be the man I've been dreaming of, and be able to attract someone who might see something special in me.

This lead me to the person I am today. I'm in very good physical condition (almost got that six pack!!), I have a good job (engineering), and I have turned myself into a person that can confidentially converse with anyone in the room. I seem to have develped the ability to get almost anyone to open up to me, and I feel like a likeable person finally. People seem confortable around me. I've witnessed women noticing me finally, which makes me feel great, because I feel like my hard work paid off. I've been able to get really close to some very attractive women lately, however, they always seem to be in a relationship. These women seen very comfortable in being around me, and some of opened up to me in ways that I couldn't have even imagined. One even let me scroll through her social media accounts, and said she would set me up with anyone I wanted. I was very flatted by that, but don't know if she's saying that out of pity...

My question is: how do these women view me? Do they pity me? Do they look at me as a weak man? Do they feel sorry for me? Am I essentially a gay best friend? I'm horrible at reading people, and I want to make sure I'm on the right track. I'm in my twenties and have had such low self esteem all my life. I've never had a serious relationship, or a girlfriend, and I would appreciate some candid feedback. Thank you for reading :)

tl;dr: Socially awkward man worked on bettering himself, and is now wondering if women see him as a potential partner, or pity him and view him as a weak man."

I'm by no means a garbage student, however, I ended my undergrad with only a 2.98, when I knew I was capable of so much more.
