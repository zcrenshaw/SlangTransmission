"PLEASE NOTE: We will not be allowing any future threads regarding the Kavanaugh allegations or hearings for the time being.


We have been inundated with threads related to Kavanaugh since news of the accusations broke. After discussing the matter, the moderation team has decided to disallow further threads related to the accusations and hearings until further notice.

We are doing this for two main reasons. First, these threads are a moderation nightmare and easy pickings for anti-women brigades from other subreddits. 

Secondly and more importantly, we do not believe we would be doing our jobs as moderators if we allowed our users to be continually re-traumatized by discussing this issue. 

Institutionalized sexual assault is an issue that is very personal to many of our users and many mod team members, and at this point we believe there is nothing beneficial to be gained by continually rehashing this story.

All further threads regarding Kavanaugh will be pulled immediately, and threads regarding sexual assault and negative traumatic experience will be heavily scrutinized to ensure they are not being posted in bad faith.

Please note that violation of this rule will result in moderator action against the user posting, up to and including a ban from this subreddit.
