"WOC, what's your experience with ""rape culture"" with in your own culture?


I was recently speaking with one of my Middle school students. She is a Hispanic little girl who is a tomboy. Some boys had pushed her and insulted her in the hallway and she immediately started making excuses for them. The line that stood out to me was ""that's what I get for being around boys"". 

That got me thinking about my own experiences within my family, where I can now see that I was unconsciously being taught to excuse this behavior from boys and how my ethnicity played into this. 

So fellow WOC, what are your experiences?"
