My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer just before Christmas. It was small and we got it early. They removed the lump and three sentinel lymph nodes and gave her radiation. She is cancer free.

"How hard is it to actually live on your own? (I have a child, parents/single parents welcome)


Living with my parents has reached the breaking point. I went to dinner with my friend for ONE hour tonight, while my son was with his father. I was under no obligation to anyone. My mom called me 3 times, then texted “hello where r u” I said “dinner”, her response “so?? Hello?? Call.” Nothing urgent, she couldn’t handle not interrupting me having fun. 

If I’m out with anyone, she calls over and over and then when I answer she says “where *are* you” in the most evil tone she can muster. I can only hang out with my friends at expensive dinners. Not allowed at peoples apartments or I’ll get called a sl*t, even with casual friends. 

I AM 23! I have a job that pays $17/hr or roughly $1800-2100 a month depending on how much I work. I have insurance on my son, my own car, school is paid for and I graduate in May. Most important, I have $50,000 in the bank in my name from working for years. Stated that I’d like to move out, and get an earful about how life is awful, hard, impossible for single moms, that I’ll never survive. 

So ladies, how actually hard is it? "

"I am not a little girl anymore


Okay so this is something that’s been bothering me for a while and it’s my body. When I was a pre-teen, I became really skinny (I was a little chunky before), and people liked to say I was too skinny, which i personally don’t think I was at all but I still took it as a compliment. I ate like crap and ate quite a lot too, but I never gained anything. Pretty much right after I turned 16, I was taken out of public school for personal reasons which put me into a deep depression. My psychiatrist put me on new meds which changed my body completely. I gained probably 20 pounds which gave me hideous stretch marks. It took me maybe 6 months to finally realize it was my medicine that was affecting my body. I’m not fat by any means, but I definitely went from a little kids body to a “woman’s”, (curvier) and not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I just don’t feel confident about myself at all. I’m 17 now and have been dieting on and off which has helped a little bit, but i’m afraid ill never be back to where I was before and it honestly upsets me quite a lot. I’ll look at old pictures of me from when i was in school and how I looked, and my mood will change automatically. Any advice on learning to accept the drastic change in my physical appearance? I know I probably shouldn’t be complaining but It’s a big insecurity that’s been bothering me for about a year now and I just don’t really know how to handle it. I go to a therapist every week but I just feel embarrassed to bring this situation up to her. "
"Being on birth control


I’ve been on birth control since I was 12. Yep, 12. And I am now 22. I had to be on it since then became my cramps got so bad I would almost pass out. It helps my cramps a lot and I’m on continuous birth control pills so I only get my period every four months, which is really nice. Last year I thought my body needed a break from birth control. I’ve always had anxiety, depression, fatigue, stomach problems, since I was in my early teens. Last year I thought maybe it was the birth control. I got off of it for 3 months  and felt better overall (idk if it was placebo) but had to get back on because my cramps and my period was all messed up (I should’ve gave it more time but I just got nervous as I haven’t been off of birth control basically since I became a “woman”). When I was off of my birth control I actually had a sex drive also and I NEVER have a sex drive, it makes me feel horrible. My question here basically is, should I continue on birth control or give my body more of a break?? I’m having sex but I’m fine with condoms just worried about all the changes in my body again. Is it bad to be on my birth control so long?? If I get off can it help some of my issues? I’ve talked to my doctor and tried other forms of birth control. The doctor says being on it this long is fine but I just don’t feel right about it. "
