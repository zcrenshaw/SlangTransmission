"“Where’s the bottled apple juice?!”


So I work as a cashier in a large chain grocery store. I was working the express lane today and it was pretty slow so I was just sort of waiting for somebody to come through since cashiers aren’t permitted to leave their cash throughout their shift unless told to. Especially today, when on the weekends all lanes are guaranteed open from 12-5 and I worked 10-3.
Sometime around 2 these two old ladies come to my lane. The old lady that was speaking to me will be OL and I’ll be Me. Here’s how this interaction went:

OL, in a pissed off tone: Where’s the bottled apple juice?! We’ve been walking around the store forever and she (gestures to the second old lady) is in in agony from walking. 

*the second lady says nothing but appears to be okay* 

Me: oh umm I believe it’s in isle 3 just right there if we have any. (I had to read the overhead signs on the lane that tell you exactly what’s in them because as cashiers, we don’t walk around the store and unless you grocery shop a lot you don’t know where things are. Also, isle 3 was like 10 steps away from my lane) 

OL starts backing up her cart full of groceries (even though my lane has a 1-12 items sign on it) and starts getting mad at the other old lady telling her to stay there while she went looking for the juice. The other old lady resists and wants to go with her. OL says something nasty under her breath but I can’t make out what she’s saying.

The two leave and the cashier working at the lane in front of mine turns back to me and gives me a face like “what was their issue” I laugh because it was honestly a really strange interaction. Another cashier working the self checkouts comes up to me after and goes “did you hear what they just said?!” I say no and she tells me as they were walking off, OL says:
“I figured the fucking little bastards would go get it for me” 

You think I’d be hurt but honestly it just made me laugh. Like.... okay??? First, neither of them asked me to go get anything in the first place or call anybody down to get it for them. Second, even if they did ask me I’m not allowed to leave my check out to go grocery shopping for customers as they’re in my line. If they had asked me to call down somebody to grab it for them I would have been more than happy to do so. 
I ended up laughing about it for the rest of my shift because it was so bizarre. They almost ended up coming back through my lane, which I was hoping they’d do because it was a boring shift and I wasn’t against having some customer drama to make things interesting, but somebody stopped them because they had way more than the 12 item limit."
"“Why doesn’t this come in silk?” Because you’re in an athleisure store...


Soooo on my days off from my Monday - Friday job I work at a higher end athleisure store because, well, student loans! Today an older couple came in. The husband instantly approached me. OM = older man, OW = older woman, and ME = me haha

OM: do you work here? 
ME: yes! What brings you in today?
OM: follow me! *grabs my arm and walks me across the store*
OM: this shirt - what other fabrics does it come in?
ME: I’m sorry, sir. This style only comes in this spandex material, but we have other similar styles in other fabrics...
OM: *interrupting me* I need this in silk
ME: I’m sorry, our store doesn’t actually carry anything in silk 
OM: *instantly gets furious* WHY NOT? Where can I get this exact shirt in silk?
ME: wellllll, this shirt is specific to our brand and we don’t carry anything in silk so I’m not really sure. You may have to look elsewhere for a similar style?
OM: are you telling me I can’t buy this shirt?!
OW: Harold, I already explained this to you! Stop harassing this young woman! Let’s go. 
ME: *turns to woman and mouths thank you*

As frustrating as that man was, at least his wife was a sweetheart! "
"When retail tenants think they are smarter than management ...



I manage three corporate buildings that have retail options on the ground floor. Many of these are food based due to the location. 

Quite recently a tenant claimed that our security department allowed people into their store and that those people stripped the owners clean of produce and equipment. They were looking for compensation. 

Our CCTV caught a delivery van, and two cars driving into our car park at 1:30am. The owner of the business, a staff member and two other men stepped out of the vehicles. 

They were filmed wheeling shopping carts out of a corridor that, stupidly, they had also been filmed stashing two days prior. 

Some two hours later, they reappear with shopping casters loaded with equipment, disposable stock and fresh produce to which they loaded into the vehicles. 

Some hours later, same business owner comes onto the property and is filmed acting so surprised and ranting that he has been robbed. 

Cue abusive phone calls and allegations. Franchise head office threatens legal action. 

We hand footage over to head office. Phone calls stop. We call owner who states that he won’t be fielding questions today. We call head office who advises that they have dropped all allegations and offered to pay all costs and damages caused by tenant. 

Love our cctv :)
