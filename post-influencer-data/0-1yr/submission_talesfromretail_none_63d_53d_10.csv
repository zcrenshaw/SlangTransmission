"A customer’s broken item from another store..


I worked in a costume jewellery store, we sold relatively cheap jewellery people would buy for formals or weddings. We have a small repair kit at work with some pliers, it has a bunch of o rings and spare clasps for jewellery. One day a customer came into my store with his family and asked me if we sold o rings. He wanted to fix his bracelet he purchased from another store. I offered to fix it and he didn’t want me to do it, so I put a couple of o rings in a tiny resealable bag and gave it to him. He asked for the cost and I told him it’s free, our repair kit had over 100 of these cheap little o rings. I told him that if he lost the the ones I gave him, to come back in and I’d give him some more considering they are quite small.

He came back in later in the afternoon, and I thought that maybe he would need some more o rings. Instead, him and his family gave me a box of expensive chocolates expressing how thankful they were and how much they struggled finding the o rings until they came into my store. They praised my customer service and were the kindest souls. I was in absolute shock because I didn’t feel like it was deserved. This will always stick with me, they absolutely made my year with it. I couldn’t wipe the massive grin off my face!"

So, there's a shoplifter that always comes in my store. The last time we tried to kick her out, the police took two hours to arrive and she spent the entire two hours flipping out and screaming at us. She's disgusting, has sores all over her body, meth mouth, hacked off blond hair,  the whole nine yards. She's stolen a ton of stuff from us, we have proof, a trespass order, and though we've tried to be extremely nice to her in the past, she just couldn't stop getting her fix. 

&amp;#x200B;

She came in today, and this was the first time I had been on the clock for her post-tantrum shenanigans. The other managers are....somewhat cowardly when it comes to suspicious persons. I, on the other hand, take delight in pissing them off. Now, I deal with a lot of meth heads. And I happen to know the best way to piss off a meth head is to make them paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

So she comes in with her boytoy, looking especially meth-y since the last I saw her. I say ""Hey! Nice to see you again! I'll be right around here if you need any help. And I give her the trademark stare. You know the one. The one that every mid-level under-paid over-worked manager gives that chills you straight to the bone as though Satan himself just shook your hand. She nods and keeps looking through the overpriced apparel, you know, the ones that have the curvy checkmark on them. You know, the ones that everyone comes in and rips the sensors off of? But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

I stand right behind her, five feet away. And I stare. 

&amp;#x200B;

She starts wigging out a little. Puts a bunch of thin, easy-to-fold-and-stuff-in-your-pants clothing in her arms, and walks over to a different department.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow behind the whole time, just staring. Not saying a word.

&amp;#x200B;

She starts whispering to her boytoy. ""Look at this bitch. We're being gangstalked right now. This is gangstalking. I'm being gangstalked."" Picks up another piece of clothing. High price, sensored.

&amp;#x200B;

I just follow. Don't say a word. Just stare.

&amp;#x200B;

She moves to every department in the store. Every single one. The whole time I just follow behind her. Staring.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell she's at least a little sober this time, because she's speaking in coherent sentences. She's telling her boytoy that I'm a bitch, I'm a whore, etc., etc., etc...nothing I haven't heard before lady.

&amp;#x200B;

She walks by me and says ""This is harassing. You are harassing me. I could call the police on you. What you're doing is wrong."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I just smile and said ""It's my store, turns out I can stand wherever I want!"" And kept staring.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, she gets fed up. She SLAMS her armful of merchandise on our front counter, STOMPS over to her bike, tells her boytoy ""We are LEAVING. I am SO SICK of being TREATED LIKE THIS. LOOK AT HER. LOOK AT HER SMUG FACE. SHE'S STILL WATCHING. LOOK LADY. I'M NOT STEALING ANYTHING. ARE YOU HAPPY? QUIT GANGSTALKING ME.""

&amp;#x200B;

And she left!

"Customer lies and assumes we are a chain retail


I work at a small-but-not-so-small local furniture store as a cashier. When I say furniture I mean we mostly profit off of plates and other kitchen merchandise. Naturally because of the sheer amount of plates, when a store wide sale comes around customers tend to leave non-discounted items in the wrong place.

So from time to time customers are frustrated when a plate they come to check out comes out regular price which is 100% understandable.

Once during our store sale, I had a customer with around 2 dozens of varying items, mostly plates. Unfortunately for her none of the items ring up as sales price as they are our “hot buys” aka new seasonal items. 

She proceeded to claim these were supposed to be among our sales items and so I told her the plates she had are new dinner plates. Now, so that things don’t get confusing, the percentage sale she was claiming these were under was xx% off, which is the BIGGEST percentages off we have. That sale was ONLY for the dessert plate collection.

Her reply was, “These are plates! What else would they be used for aside from dinner? What’s the difference?” She then scoffed and crossed her arms in annoyance.

There is a ginormous difference. Dessert plates in that particular collection was small and often came with cutlery and sets to entice customers to buy in bulk.

I asked her if she knew where she got these from. I knew she was just lying but I was asking out of courtesy to see if some items were misplaced.
Lo and behold, she would only point at a generalized direction and acted as if this whole thing was a waste of her time (of course, not wasteful enough to simply show herself to the door and forget this whole thing).

At this point she began claiming she bought the same exact items just a few days ago. Mind you, these were 2 dozens of items of different models and location so unless she painstakingly memorized each of them there was no way she could’ve recalled that. I told her these items are recent and have not gone on sale for the duration of their shelf time. 

I think this was when she gave up trying to haggle me because she just let out a frustrated sigh and said “It must’ve been another one of your stores then, because I got those items xx% off. I don’t need them anymore.” And walked away.

This store is not a chain. It’s literally the only one in existence."
