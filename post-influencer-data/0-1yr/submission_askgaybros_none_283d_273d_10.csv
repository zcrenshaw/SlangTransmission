"Bottom/Verse Guys, How Long Do You Like the Top to Last?


Title says it all. When you're with a guy, are you someone who enjoys longer foreplay/oral/other stuff and don't spend much time on penetration, or do you prefer to spend most of sex being penetrated? I don't last as long if foreplay is drawn out and there's oral involved (then I feel bad if I cum too soon lol); otherwise I last longer if we get right to it.

What's your guys' preference? Tips for lasting longer?"
"Vers mostly bottomed curious about topping.


Hey my dudes, so I am vers but I have mostly bottomed and I have this date w this hot bottom ... Idk how to top, I just like to kiss, cuddle and all the intimate stuff.

I tried before topping but I keep getting not completely hard and don't know how to move my body when I top... any advice would be greatly appreciated❤."
"What would be a good jockstrap brand color combo for me?


I've always wanted one, but don't really know what my fellow gays are wearing besides Aussiebum? Help me out plz. I'll post a pic wearing them if that's motivation for anybody. :p"
"What do I do?!


Generic post title I know, but I don't know what else to call it, I'm soooo scared right now.

Okay so I'm sixteen and my name is Joey, and I have a cousin named Rebekah who's fifteen. She lives in Tennessee and I live in Florida.

I'm gay but 95% of my family is homophobic so I don't like discussing lgbt shit with them, at all.

So last yr in Nov 2017 I made a rlly dumb decision by telling Rebekah that I identify as gay. I know it was stupid but it is what it is and next time I plan on using better judgement. She told me that I could tell her anything and yeah I fell for it. 

She told her dad, who is from *Tennessee*, and so he told my parents directly. After that they went back to Tennessee.

My parents were P I S S E D at me after that and they still are, a year later. But ya know, they had to find out sometime so if they don't like it, oh well, I guess. My whole paternal family knows at this point, but, I don't fuck with them anyway so I don't rlly care.

I also don't fuck with Rebekah anymore, and every time we've interacted since then has been horrid, and so, so, so, awkward. 

But we've never directly discussed me being gay, it's always been subtle and unspoken of, but still awkward because it's on both of our minds when we think of each other.

Today I was in my sixth period messing around on Instagram, and I saw Rebekah having one of those q and a things. She said to **tell her something** or ask her a question.

I jokingly created a draft saying ""Hey thx telling for telling mi parents I'm gay :)"" and showed my friend named Kyra. She's familiar with this whole situation, and she's been pushing me to talk to her about being gay which I always objectn too. 

Kyra saw an opportunity to achieve what she wanted, so she tried to hit send. I pulled my phone back, but she reached harder and sent the message. I cleared some of the words so the message Rebekah got was ""Hey thx for telling mi parents I""

I started panicking but Kyra told me it was for the best, and my goals would be achieved now so to calm down.\\

An hour later, got this picture from Rebekah along with a few messages.

[The picture](https://imgur.com/2g5CXaV), and [the messages](https://imgur.com/rjOSgTc). 

Btw I'm not sure what she meant when she said ""Two years ago"", this all happened in Nov 2017, only one year ago not two. 

Also those messages bothered me. She tried to take the role of a victim when she was the original to betray me.

I'm scared as shit. She's gonna tell her *Tennessean* dad again, and he's gonna tell my parents again. My parents will once again be P I S S E D and I am honestly scared of how this will play out.

I haven't responded to Rebekah at all. I simply left her on read but I'm assuming she already told her father.

What do I do?!"
"My friend is acting strangely.. should I worry?


Today I told my friends that I got a boyfriend(I'm bi, so are most of them), while I told one in particular separately and in person first. He is a bi male, so am I. I sort of said it quietly and he didn't really say anything, but I could tell he was uncomfortable, but he brushed it off and we didn't talk about it. 

Later I texted all my friends in a group chat about it; they were happy for me. The friend I talked to earlier didn't respond, but his brother did. He dm'd me on Steam about something unrelated, and never really said anything about it other than the uncomfortable look he gave. This friend doesn't usually have his phone on him, but I'm pretty sure he was just at home. And, as I was saying, he was online later on. 

I don't think he really had any feelings for me, at least he never acted it before today, but I feel like something is wrong. This friend knows my bf and has talked to him but has never met him in person. I don't really read what he's trying to say at the moment. Maybe I'm just a little unstable because a lot has been happening to me.

I just wanted to write my thoughts down, so sorry as this post has very little purpose existing, but I'd like to hear other peoples' thoughts."
"About blowjobs


I gave my first blowjob almost six hours ago. Retrospectively, I realise that the man was way too hung for a first blowjob, but I did not care. It was pathetic because I have no experience and my teeth kept hurting him. Also, I wouldn't stop choking on his cock because he would push it down my throat. He let me know that he wouldn't be able to cum in those conditions, which made me sad because I really wanted to taste semen. As I was sad, he decided to do his best in trying to confort me by cumming in my mouth, so he facefucked me hard. I vomited and he did not cum.

I really don't want this to happen again, ever. Is there any way to avoid throwing up while giving a blowjob?

Additionally, I want to forget what happened, so I wonder, am I still a virgin? I mean, this is my very first sexual contact and he didn't even cum. It wasn't memorable and if I were to do it again with another guy soon, I would forget the first one within a year. "
"New ways to eat ass?


I'm meeting a hot twink on Sunday and I'm looking for something a bit new. Usually I have him on all fours on the bed whilst rimming him. I much prefer him lying down on the bed but his dick gets in the way and he finds it uncomfortable, sadly. 

What positions do you guys like to eat ass in and what other positions can I try? I'm not sure about face sitting.."

"Do I bareback or not?


So I've have a new friend known each other for 2/3 months. Mutual attraction and generally are pretty good friends to the point where I trust him. We've been pretty open about a lot of stuff. Ive been with 3 guys in the last. This friend is older. A few days ago things got sexual and we did oral stuff. Enterimg a FWB situation possibly. 

I want to have anal sex. He says he strongly prefers barebacking. Says he got tested recently and is healthy. Apparently got tested when we talked about doing stuff. I trust hes being truthful. I'm hesitant to bareback because itd be my first time without protection and mistakes are bad and could be permanent. So do I bb or nah?

"What do you think about The Golden Girls?


I think it's amazing that a show about old ladies that came out in the mid-eighties and ended in 1992 continues to be as funny and uproarious. None of the jokes feel dated and these women are shady. 

I've always been aware of the popularity The Golden Girls has with gay men and it's not difficult to know why. I mean, who hasn't met a ""Dorothy"" or a ""Blanche"" or a ""Rose"" at a gay event or an LGBT center? Besides, it's about three strangers and an old woman creating their own family through their living arrangements, something many gays can relate to. 

It was also one of the few network shows to deal with gay issues: Blanche had a gay brother, Dorothy's brother was a transvestite, Rose was the object of desire of a Lesbian friend from Dorothy (though Blanche thought she was Lebanese) and Sophia made a heartwarming speech about gay marriage way before gay marriage became a possibility.

"How bad is the transphobia in the cis gay community?


So I’m trans. FTM. I’m not transitioned yet BUT this question is asking about when I am fully transitioned. 

I like boys. I like butts. I like a good bootyhole. I’m 100% a dom top. Love me a good twink too. 

However, I’m terrified of what it’s going to be like trying to date in the gay community. Will people reject me from the community or potential relationships because I’m trans? Will people only accept me if I go 100% on the transition and have bottom surgery too? 

I’ve heard a lot of nightmareish stories from same sex attracted trans men (and women in the lesbian community). I’m scared and I want to know beforehand. 

All I ask for you to do before answering is be completely honest, no holds barred, don’t worry about being transphobic in your answers because I don’t want sugar coated things to protect my feelings. I want it as honest as possible. Would you be okay because I am a man? Would you not be okay because you view me as a girl still? 

Thanks in advance. While of course I’d not like transphobia, I’m asking for people to be honest so I can know what to expect and some of those things will be transphobic. "
"Looking to be a fan of you.


Hi guys! 

   I used to send money to a couple of guys regularly for each vid they would send me. I think it’s the hottest to be a regular fan. Was wondering if anybody else would be game? "

"Bi-sexual and in need of some quick cash.


Hi all,

Years ago I received a random email from some guy in response to an ad I posted on CL (ironically looking for FEMALE company) who wanted to pay me a good sum of money for me to allow him to perform oral on me... I didn't even give it a thought and ignored it.

Today, years later, I'm in a different place and am comfortable in my sexuality that I might have to stop and think about it.

$500 dollars would go along way.

I guess my question is this: I know there is a market out there of men that look for that type of situation. But where does one go to find or advertise something like that?"

"Where to have sex when neither party can host?


(Using a throwaway for this one.)

I’m a college student in a liberal city in the US. I’ve been dating this guy for a while now, but both of us are going to be in separate states over winter break and we won’t be able to see each other.

We’d really like to have sex one last time before we go home for break, but we’ve hit a bit of a snag. Usually we do it in his room, but for a number of complicated reasons (mostly involving roommates) neither of us will be able to host this time around.

We’ve tried to think of a few options, but none seem especially practical. Hotels in this city are really expensive, and we aren’t actually looking to sleep over anyways. Both of us live in dorms and neither of us have friends with extra rooms to lend us.

And so, I turn to you guys. For the more experienced gaybros out there, where would you usually go to have sex when neither party could host? Are there any inventive solutions that we haven’t thought of yet?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
