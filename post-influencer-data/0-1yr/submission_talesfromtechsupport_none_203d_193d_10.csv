"Your product is trash, I want a refund.


I work with a small team that provides tech support for a company that produces many types of computing equipment, mainly networking devices. 

I work an early morning and weekend shift which with our tiny team size means i spend at least half of my week flying solo. Going to be a little long strap in. 

Me = Me
MU = Mac User


It's about 7 am on a sunday and my first call of the day rolls in.

Me : &lt;Opening garble starts but is interupted&gt;
MU : You suck, and so do your products

Now i'm not a tactful person by any means the fact i (still) have a consumer facing position confuses me. I also have a scottish accent that to my wife's amusement gets thicker as i get annoyed, drunk or flustered.

Me : &lt;Tone change&gt; Right, what can i do for you today.

MU : Your product sucks and i want a refund.

Me : Unfortunately we don't actually sell any of these products directly so we don't handle refunds but if you're having technical issues I can try and help y'out, if you want a refund you would have to talk to the vendor. 

MU : Unacceptable

Me : Right, well this is tech support, not sales and if you are just here to yell it me i don't want it. 

MU : If you would just do your job. . .

Me : &lt;Interupting&gt; What seems to be the issue.

MU :  Finally! Some service, I require a refund.

Me : No, as i stated previously we do not handle refunds. If you absolutely must process this through us it would be a replacement and only if there is a problem found on the device.

MU : Well this is unacceptable ,After you are done replacing my unit I would like to speak to someone in charge as this piece of crap does not work and the fact that you are making me jump through these hoops is unacceptable.

Me : Before we can even think about replacing this I will need to collect some information on the product such an serial number and your contact information and begin troubleshooting.

MU : Humph,Whatever as long as it gets done now! &lt;Provides info&gt;

Me : What seems to be the issue?

MU : It dosen't work! I need a refund. 

Me : Specifically what does the unit do that is causing the problem. 

MU : It won't connect to my mac, I have not had any other problems connecting things to my Mac so clearly your product is trash.

&lt;Finally information I can work with&gt;

Me : Is the ethernet cable connected from the unit to your network?

MU : HOW DARE YOU, You assume i have not connected this correctly? I am &lt;""I dont give a shit"" IT possition at big company&gt;, The cabling is connected and it's flashing green. 

Me : Ok, good we have network connection, What are the other lights on the front of the unit doing?

MU : Nothing, see its broken. When I try and turn on nothing happens therefore it is broken refund me now or I'll take this further. I hit the power button and nothing. 

Me : Power button?

MU : YES! THE FUCKING BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE TRASH BOX YOU SOLD ME!

Me : Read the button.

&lt;All i could muster without blowing my shit&gt;

MU : HOW D. . .

Me : Read the button.

MU : Pow. . . F-f-function. 

Me : Right, we calm?

MU : Yes sir &lt;sad&gt;

Me : Power switch is on the back of the unit. Turn that to on and tell me what happens.

MU :&lt;depressed tone&gt; power light is now flashing. 

Me : Once the unit is on you can use it.  Anything else i can do for you today.

&lt;10 seconds of silence then the call disconnects&gt;
