"TIFU by not hitting my girlfriend's ass


Short and sweet one: Today, my girlfriend and I were presented the rare treat of an empty apartment, and thus decided to get nice and loud.  As she was riding me cowgirl, I decided to give her ass a nice hard slap; however, as we were being rougher than usual, she was bouncing up and down in a manner that made it hard to hit her bum.  Thus, on my attempt at spanking her, my hand instead collided against my left testicle.  Instantly, a pain shot through the core of my very being, causing me to cry out in pain.  My girlfriend, being the epitome of love and sympathy that she is, immediately collapsed on the bed cackling like a mad witch while I cradled my bruised babymakers.

Tl;dr: Attempted a blind slap on a quickly moving bum, bitchslapped my testicles instead."
"TIFU by letting my wife nair my butt


The male community is pretty split on the forest vs clearing debate when it comes to bums. I happen to like a well manicured booty. Normally, I use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. I do this every couple of weeks or so.

The downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. I was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. ""You should let me nair your butt."" Said she, with a gleam in her eyes. ""Its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.""

""Well, okay."" Says I.

Elated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. Marriage is strange. A few minutes later, I wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. I mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. It was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. I finally understood what that Santara song was about. All was good in the world. Or so I thought.

The next day I noticed some slight itchiness, but I figured it would pass, so I just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as I could. Later that night, my wife and I got undressed and got in the shower together. We were having an unrelated conversation, when I remembered the itchiness I had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. ""Well turn around so I can take a look."" So I turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.

...

Dead silence. 

I turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. I craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and I was met with a horrifying sight. Like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was COVERED in huge, bright red bumps. Unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while I jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. Overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.

My wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as I did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.

I maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.

Moral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. 

TL;DR: I let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like Freddy Kruger face fucked a topographical map of Utah."
"TIFU by giving my GFs mom a birthday card


So this happened today and idk what to do. Today is my GF's mom's (lets call her Ann) birthday. I decided to wake up extra early and pick up some cool stuff to wish her a happy birthday. We have a pretty good relationship in general and shes gotten me stuff for my birthday before so i felt it was pretty appropriate. Just some general background info, I was born in another country and came here when i was in my teens. Parents dont know common sayings/generation references, so I didnt know much either. Anyways, i go to get some chocolate and flowers and decide that a birthday card would be a great idea too! so i look at the Hallway at my local store and find something i thought was pretty cute! it was a picture of a beaver taking a shower and it said something like ""Be a clean beaver on your birthday!"" ill link it in the bottom. So i grab this card because it was cute and write something like ""Be a clean beaver every day!"" and head over to their place.

I come in and see Ann and give her a hug. I hand the flowers, chocolate, and card and wish her happy birthday. My Gf is there and thought it was sweet, which i think to myself ""Nice! worked out and she seems happy!"" well, 5 seconds later they both have a mortified god awful look on their face and im very confused. They take 3 minutes to explain to me what a ""clean beaver"" means and dont really believe me when i explain i had no idea that's what it meant.

I'm 33 years old. I gave my possible mother-in-law a ""keep your beaver clean"" card for her birthday. No one believes that i didnt know thats what it meant.

TL;DR : I gave my Gf's mom a birthday card telling her to clean her lady parts."
"TIFU by ejaculating on my sergeant’s night snack [NSFW]


This happened about two years ago and it’s been heavy on my mind ever since. I would like to speak about it to ease the burden and please don’t judge me too much for being a retard.

Two years ago, I was serving National Service in Singapore(mandatory for all males) and after a couple of months of vocational training, I was sent to a cool unit where I would spend the rest of my time until I completed my National Service(two years in total). It was a small unit with fewer than twenty people in total and we had to work a full day’s shift with a sergeant and two enlisted men. All three of us were conscripted soldiers bidding our time. Cutting out the technical details - the three of us worked in an isolated room where we had to be there for twenty four hours for the duration of our shift.

We were not allowed to leave this room and it came with an attached bathroom for us to shower and pee/poop. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and night snack would be sent to us by an external staff and we would return the food bag the following day when we were done with our duty. It gets really boring as trouble was extremely unlikely to happen and we basically sat all day talking and idling. When it was night time, the sergeant would sleep till morning and the two enlisted men would take turns to monitor the system.

One night, my fellow enlisted man was having a headache and I volunteered to cover the night shift on my own so he could rest. I was extremely bored as we didn’t have any internet access and mobile phones were prohibited. I just laid idly and waited for the time to pass. This was right about three in the morning and I had another three hours to kill. I was also extremely horny as I hadn’t had a release in a while(single, prostitution was a once a month luxury). 

I had read an ex-convict’s blog about how they used to release their sexual tension by stealing hotdog buns and use it to masturbate and was curious to give it a go(brain fart!). Right then, I remembered we had hotdogs for night snack and figured trying it out since I had nothing to do at that time. I used the bun and pleasured myself and came in it after a while. We didn’t have rubbish bins as to prevent rodents and had to keep our trash in the food bag so I quickly placed the sausage back in the bun and placed it in the food bag. We have separate food bags for each meal and I figured once we had to change shift, I would bring all the food bags out and get rid of the bun. 

Here is the part I fucked up. I was so tired after the action that I dozed off at the desk. When I woke up, I realise it was morning and people had started walking around. Half-awake, I quickly glanced around and realised all the food bags were gone. That sight got me up real fast and I asked where were the bags and the other man told me that my sergeant cleared them. To my horror, he said my sergeant had eaten the night snack in the morning as he was hungry and could not wait till the shift was over for breakfast.

I was fucking shitting my pants and hoped he wouldn’t suspect anything. He came in later to tell us we could get ready to leave and nothing was out of place. He was acting normally and we went home after. I couldn’t sleep for weeks and tried avoiding duties with him after the incident.

I felt really bad but I dared not tell him what had happened and I was pretty sure I would be sent to military prison. Ever since, I gave up eating hotdogs entirely. 

TLDR: Masturbated in night snack(hotdog bun) and failed to clear it in time before sergeant ate it for breakfast"
"TIFU by making a 6000+ km drunk trip


Actually happened a few years ago; using a throwaway because I still work with some of those people...

I was living in south-east Asia back then, and I was regretting to have moved so far away from home (I'm from Europe) for a job I didn’t like. One evening my manager took me out for drinks and we got quite hammered. Around midnight we said goodbye and I took a cab home, where I signed on Skype and started chatting with a friend living in Barcelona. He told me how much he loved his life there, and jokingly said that I should join him...

This is when massively-drunken me decided “You know what? F\*\*\* it, let’s do it!”. I looked on Skyscanner and found a flight leaving Barcelona around 2AM with a layover in Qatar. I bought the tickets on my credit card, packed my bag (including, for some reason, my 25-DVD full series of Battlestar Galactica), and jumped in a cab to the airport. On my way, I wrote an email to my manager telling him that I was leaving the country and wouldn’t come back. 

I managed to make it just in time to drop my bags at check-in, go trough immigration, pass security screening and board the plane - all of this without anyone stopping me for being so obviously drunk. So happy to be “finally free”, I sat down and fell asleep almost instantly. Fast forward 6 hours. I woke up, looked around, realized that wasn’t as rock’n’roll as I my drunk self thought I was, and had one of the most brilliant “Well, shit.” moments of my life. 

After landing in Qatar for the layover, I managed to call my manager and I explained him the situation (he was pretty pissed, but took it quite easy). Then I convinced the airline to convert the remainder of my Barcelona trip to a ticket back home (bullshitted them that the client I was supposed to visit cancelled last minute). Unfortunately, they could not fly me back to my origin in the next 48 hours because all flights were full, and I had to settle with a flight to a neighbour country (flight was still something like 10h later). From there I had to change airports by taxi, managed to get into another plane that brought me home, and rushed to the office after having missed one day and a half of work. 

No need to say my return to the office was pretty awkward, not to mention that the CEO of the company was visiting that day and asked several people about my whereabouts... In addition, that whole trip cost me altogether around USD 1500, and a lifetime of jokes from my then-manager (shout out to him btw, he covered my stupid ass 100% on this one).

TLDR; Got drunk. Decided to quit my job and fly to the other side of the world. Sobered up and chickened out. Cost me USD 1500 and some of my dignity."
"TIFU by throwing shit out of the window


Hello reddit.

English is not my first language.

I just moved from a small city to a larger one because I got a better paying job on a bigger company. I work as a software engineer. On my first day I received an invite for a meeting but it was just for the men of the floor, not the women. The invite had no subject, and there were different team's so it could not been related to work. I attended the meeting, and the summary was that there was a legendary pooper on the office. No one could caught him, and he would always take big shits, all over the stalls, on the walls, and such, leaving an horrible mess behind.

He was even known as the ninja pooper, because one day  he took one of his big shits and them when people found it, the shit had one footprint on it, and by investigating it, people concluded that it was fresh. So they put the whole company on lockdown and looked through everyone shoe's soles but found nothing.

The human resources would often take pictures and send them to all of the men of the company, trying to shame the unknown ninja pooper into a confession. And it was not a intestine issue either, because his ""attacks"" would only occur when the company did something bad. It was always ""politic"". Unpaid overtime? shit all over the bathroom. Too much overtime? shit all over the bathroom. Switching health insurance to a worst plan? shit all over. No bonus that semester? shit all over.

And in the meeting, the men of the floor were really tired of his shit (sorry for the pun), and were telling that they would caught him in the end. And they even were suspecting that the ninja pooper could be more than one person, so that's the reason that he was not caught yet. The multiple pooper theory is important to my fuck up.

A couple of months and some shit attacks later, I was having a hard time with the work. too much to do and too little time left. As I was really worried with a task, the urge to take a shit starts to get stronger and stronger. being too focused on my coding I ignored it as much as I can, until I could keep it in no more.

Here is the fuck up. I got up and rushed to the nearest bathroom. A single bathroom with no stalls. Did my business. When I tried to flush, the horrible conclusion came to mind. It was clogged. Then for no reason the multiple ninja poopers came to my mind and I was really scared of being labeled one. And if I took too long in the bathroom I would raise more suspicion to myself. Well, in a fit of desperation I took toilet paper, made a glove, took the shit (Lucky me, the shit was a single and really solid piece) and threw it out of the window.

Now, my office was on the 7th floor. The time was around 2PM. I never ever looked out the window, or talked to anyone about that. till the end of my work day, no emails or commentary were made. I started to fell safe and relaxed, thinking that it was all over.

Then, by 6 PM came an email saying that the office would change buildings. Listening to the gossip, it became clear.

My poop wrap came undone mid air and the shit landed on the white car's hood of one of the directors of my company. He them accused the sewage of the building, the building denied, The conflict escalated and the office will change to 5-7 blocks away. That is really bad because the office was right in front of a subway station, now it will be in a worst building and location. It may even need an extra bus fare in days of rain. Some people are already thinking about changing jobs over this. Thank you for you time.

TLDR; I was heavily in need of taking a shit and took it in a clogged toiled. got scared and trew it out of the window of the seventh floor, landed on a director's car, caused a fight with the office building and my entire company is changing address now."
"TIFU by destroying my first prize won in a hackathon


This wasn't today, but I just discovered this sub, so here it goes...

I participated at a hackathon (a competition for coders to make something in around 2 days), and I won 4th place. The were five spots that would get a prize.

When looking at the things I won, it was a t-shirt and some coupons for using various services for free. It was nice overall.

I live in NL, and the Hackathon was held in US so I had the stuff shipped to me. When the mail man came he had a large box, and asked for 50 euros (around $60) import taxes. I said: ""Wtf, is that shirt made of gold or something?"".

So I took the box and it was quite heavy too, not the ""just a tshirt kind of heavy"". Stupid me still thought there was only a tshirt inside it. So he said: ""if you don't accept it we'll take it back to customs where it'll be destroyed"". So I said ""Yeah take it I'm not gonna pay for shit I won, especially when it's just a tshirt"".

A few days later, I went to my PC and an email popped up from the organisation stating: ""Hey we added a laptop too"".

I was like: ""WTF?!"". So I quickly called the postal office and the organisation to see if they could send it back anyway, but it was already with customs.

tl;dr I won a prize and then lost it again because customs destroyed it after I refused to pay import taxes."
"TIFU by masturbating in a wrong area


So I am using a throwaway as my cousin reads reddit and I don’t wanna make things awkward. 

I am staying with my aunt and uncle for summer break and my uncle runs a small seafood business where I help out thrice a week. So one of my co-worker jokingly told me that you could use the head of the squid to masturbate and it would feel close to  the real deal.

Being an idiot, I decided to try it because why not right? I went to his store in the morning to get a suitable squid head before my uncle reached and once I had found one, I used to it to do the deed in the toilet. To be honest, it wasn’t great and I wouldn’t advice anyone to try it. 

Upon ejaculation, I knew I needed to get rid of it but I couldn’t flush it down the toilet. Once I came out to bring it to the disposal area, my uncle came and asked me what was I doing. In a panic I told him that this particular squidhead was a little dirty and I rinsed it. He took it from me and placed it together with the rest of the squidheads.

I was worried as it is a massive breech of health regulations and wanted to clear it as soon as I could. Unfortunately, my uncle kept piling me with work and by the time I was back, I realised all the squids had been sold.

It’s killing me on the inside and I needed to let it out.

TL;DR I MASTURBATED INTO A SQUID HEAD AND IT WAS SOLD BEFORE I COULD STOP IT

"TIFU by cumming so hard I kickstarted my period


My long distance boyfriend (22) and I (19) were having a video call, talking about my visit, as I'm going to visit him next week and meet his family for the first time. As we talked about the things we will do together, things started heating up, as he began telling me the things he would like to do to me. This started making me horny, so I grabbed my favourite hairbrush, which has a ridged hilt and can make me cum in under a minute, and decided to play with it.

After cumming a first time he told me to play on my knees, it felt amazing, but after cumming again I felt like something was wrong. I let go of the brush and surely, there was blood on my hand. When I said ""oh fuck"" in a much different tone my SO knew something is up. Playtime was over and my nervous laughing fit began. I took the toy out, which (graphic) had blood all up in the ridges. When I got up I noticed I had stained my carpet. Fuck. I got up and cleaned the brush and carpet which was fucking disgusting, but a nasty stain on the carpet remains.

Happy period week.

TL;DR Was video calling with my SO as we decided to play with ourselves as things heated up. I used a brush hilt with ridges as a toy. After cumming a first time I got on my knees on the carpet and toyed myself until I came a second time. Triggered my period as well and dirtied up my favourite toy and left a stain on the carpet."
