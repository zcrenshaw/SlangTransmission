"TIFU by eating bugs my entire life and having a spider bite the inside of my mouth


Okay so you know some people have dark, *dark*, **dark** secrets
 Some people pick their nose, some pick it and eat it, some people eat shit, some people do really strange things. Well I like to eat live bugs. Nobody in my life knows this. I just like the way some of them are soft and taste quite gummy, I like how some are crunchy and almost explode in your mouth when you bite down. 

I started eating bugs when I was a kid. I started with ladybugs, I just kept eating them, they secrete some bitter liquid which had a really nice acquired taste. I went from lady bugs to other bugs. woodlice were my second and they were crunchy and easy to find, they also felt nice to eat when they're in their ball state (a bit like cereal). The taste isn't really the thing I like most of the time, it's the texture, how it feels in my mouth. I love to eat them to this day. I went onto other insects as I got older, I started eating spiders. In the UK there are some spiders which come out at certain times of the year which can get BIG (I think it's called the brown spider or wolf spider). When they squirm when biting down it almost adds to the texture, and the liquid that comes out is really creamy and good to eat. The legs are the problem though as they get stuck in your teeth.

Today I ate one of those spindly spiders, the daddy long legs ones. I saw some in the corner of my room, minding thier own business in their web. A moth was stuck in the web (moths are disgusting they're like eating a spoon of flour). I put the spider in my mouth and proceeded to chew it. Now before I got my bite in to kill it, I think it bit me somehow on my tongue or something. 

The worst burning sensation I have ever had happened at the moment. It was like my mouth was on fire, but not in a good way like spice. First my tongue was burning and it spread to my jaw and eventually I felt like my brain was going to come out. My tongue has a strange bumpy bit on it now and I don't know if I should see a doctor or not, and even if I did see the doctor. How the fuck do I tell him how it happened?

TL:DR

I have eaten insects all my life and a spider but the inside of my mouth"
"TIFU by sending a video without watching it and now I am being adopted


 So last Thursday night I saw everyone tagging their step dads in the Budweiser commercial. Without watching it, I sent it to my stepdad. About an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if I’m hinting at something. My step dad is like I know you had intent. I’m like HUH??? OMG IN THE COMMERCIAL THE ADULT CHILDREN ARE ASKING THEIR STEPDADS TO ADOPT THEM. So he starts crying, thinking I want this. Now I can’t tell him that I didn’t mean to. Friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. Etc etc. all I can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. But I can never say anything about it being an accident. So like now I’m being adopted and changing my name. 

Tl/dr sent a fathers day commercial to my stepdad who is adopting me now"
"TIFU by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic


Throwaway because I'm still embarrassed and I don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

For background, I usually make the bed in the mornings, but I didn't yesterday morning because I was running late.

I went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. I got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn't find her. Her wallet was there so I figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. I started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. I called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. I called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. My father in law told me to track her phone, so I went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. I turn on the find my iPhone sound and start running through the apartment thinking I should call the cops. 

I hear the sound coming from our bedroom so I go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell I'm doing. Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

I had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr I didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then I lost my wife."
"TIFU by missing every sign on a date


So didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn't until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) Beforehand, I jokingly told her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies ""Don't worry, if that were you and I, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, ""I guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in [my car] though"". I then replied ""You know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.

TLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf


Edit: There is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again."
"TIFU by accidentally humiliating an old friend in social media after he announced he and his wife are having a child.


TL;DR at the bottom.

So I have a friend from high-school that I haven't seen in forever. He is an absolute master of kindness. Driving for two hours to get you out of trouble after not seeing you for over three years type of kindness. Top bloke. Best dude you'll ever meet. Wouldn't hurt a fly. You get the picture.

Today he posted a super ecstatic picture of him and his wife with the caption ""About to be a family of three! Finally!""

His chin and face are HUGE. Like someone had injected him with some IGs influencer's lip fillers shortly after he had a massive allergic reaction to a bee sting. I automatically assumed this was on of those ridiculous Snapchat filters all the cool kids are using and that he had jokingly used it for a fun twist, so I commented something along the lines of ""Congratulations man! Let's just hope the kid doesn't get your chin lol!""

I close my phone and go back to work. His sister pops up in my chat in the meantime. Tells me he gained a lot of weight from depression, mainly from finding out he was close to being sterile. They've been trying for a kid for two years, almost breaking up multiple times.

 I jumped back to my fb to remove the comment only to find out he deleted the entire post.

I wanna die. I'm on my way over there to apologize. Wish me luck. Or death.

TL;DR Today I told my depressed, close to sterile friend I hope his miracle baby doesn't inherit his ugly face. Now I need to move to Mars."
"TIFU by letting my niece and nephew use my PSN account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday.


Maybe you already know where this is going.    


  
My niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. They're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we'll call L), and my nephew (who we'll call W) don't have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.  
All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.  


  
But imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...  


&amp;#x200B;

""A\_Sad\_Frog, can you check your bank? ""  


It was my brother in law. L and W's father.   


""W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?""  


&amp;#x200B;

My heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.   
[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)  
**(identifying details have been cropped out):**  


&amp;#x200B;

All told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. That's **FU number 1.**  
""Tell them to stop what they're doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out"".   


&amp;#x200B;

I immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can't do anything about it.  


  
So here's where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.  


  
I'm not mad at the kids. I genuinely don't think they meant it. I'm mad at myself. I didn't think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F'ed. We're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.  


So, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.   


TLDR: Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day."
"TIFU by not openning a gift for 1.5 years


This actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. I was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

In the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.

The box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

I just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..

TL;DR: Got a gift from a girl I really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside."
"TIFU by leaving my dragon dildos out to dry [NSFW]


This is literally still happening. Maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. Maybe this is it for me.

So I live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so I am alone in my unit for now. This is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

This morning I woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. I panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on Monday's"". 

And I immediately suffer a heart attack.

It is Wednesday. 

I was not expecting a janitor visit. 

In the tub, drying overnight, I had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. Lined up. Like little sex soldiers.

I hear her open the door to the bathroom, and I lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. Maybe I'll can stop existing.

I hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

A few minutes later I hear my RA walk in. I hear some comments and some laughter. They quietly convene for what feels like a long while. The RA simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. I continue not to breathe. There are four bedrooms and they don't know which one I use and all the doors are closed so if I continue to be quiet I can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

I currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. I don't know when she'll leave, if ever. I think I'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

Please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

TL;DR: Left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the RA to come look at my dragon cocks."
"TIFU by giving my 19 year old Puggle the fat off my t-bone steak


this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old &amp; he's been my best friend my whole life cause I'm 22. so he's all old &amp; fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, ""man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age &amp; condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn't expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I'm watching him eat it cause I'm all stoked he's enjoying himself &amp; feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air &amp; starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action &amp; start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker &amp; tug it out. he's unresponsive &amp; his eyes are all rolled back. I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don't know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again &amp; looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second &amp; I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). &amp; this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, &amp; starts going at it again. but much slower &amp; more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time &amp; then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love &amp; he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful &amp; boring when he leaves us. 

TL;DR I brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat."
"TIFU by telling a girl I suck a lot of dick.


This happened yesterday. I'm 23M and I study IT and as you can imagine we have a lot more guys than girls over here.

Backstory: So our small group of friends includes one girl and 3 guys including me and we make a fair number of sexist and racist jokes. When someone in the group says something and another person misses it and asks to repeat it, we tell that person that ""You know what makes you deaf? Sucking a lot of dick"". Okay saying it like this sounds pretty stupid but believe me it's funny in person. 

The fuckup: I'm going home from university and I'm standing in the bus stop. My phone starts to ring. For some reason I don't notice it and it just keeps ringing. Eventually a girl comes up and tells me that she thinks my phone is ringing. A normal person would have said ""Ohh thanks"" but what did I say? Of course I said ""Oh well you know I suck a lot of dick"". She just stared at me for a second and then walked to the opposite end of the bus stop. FML.

TL;DR: Didn't notice that phone rang, random girl alerts me, I tell her that I suck a lot of dick because it's an inside joke."
"TIFU by overestimating my tolerance to weed by a LONGSHOT.


TL;DR I took too many edibles, tripped out.

So to start off I would like to say that I smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. I smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. I have never smoked so much that I lost control of myself, or couldn't function. I have never thrown up from smoking too much, so I would like to consider myself a heavy weight. However, I had never tried edibles.

I decided to make some at home, because I like cooking, and I decided to make an omelet with canabutter. The recipe said around 5 grams of high THC concentrated grams of weed. I grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high THC content, but 4 grams for 1 WHOLE CUP of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? That seemed absurd, and I was eating w a friend, so I used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking I will just be careful with dosing. I invited A, as in ONE, friend over, (let's call him Jason)and we made the omelet. I added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time I might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). I then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but I thought it couldn't hurt so I added more. Also, the whole time I was thinking my friend would help me finish it.

I made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili's because we knew they were strong, and we didn't want to drive under the influence. I got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. I felt like the air became corn syrup. The waitress was standing right next to me, and then I blinked, and I swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. My friend was obviously also high as a kite. It's hard to explain how high I was, and then I played some games on the little Ipad they had. I sat there, and I kept thinking about how I had to say something or else it would be awkward. Then I started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(I'll go with Clarissa), I had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. I forgot my Jason was there, because in my mind I only had one friend sitting down w me at Chili's. Then I turned an saw my Jason, and he was just smiling. He said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. I asked Clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. I felt like she was gaslighting me, because I could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. I said I needed to take a piss, so I started walking to the bathrooms. That is when I walked into the girl's restroom. Luckily nobody was there, but I was so confused until I realized it was the women's restroom due to the lack of urinals. After washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold I went back to my table. As I sat down, both of my friends were gone. I thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, I honestly don't know how but I distinctly remember thinking that I had to find them or else they would be lost forever. I found my way back to our car, and they were in there. I started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn't. Sick of their shit, I started slamming, saying,"" If you fuckers don't let me in I will break this glass."" Then, to my intense horror I realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else's. I went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. They said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,"" I gotta find them."" and then walk outside. I can confidently say I was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. Safe to say I will follow recipes to the T from now on."
"TIFU by not hiding my sex bag


I had decided to reorganize my room some time ago and only made it about halfway through. My mom thought she would be nice and help clear out the clutter. Amongst my crap was the sex bag. What's a sex bag? I'm not sure if anyone else has been so clever, but I decided it would be easiest to have all the sex equipment my SO and I use in one central location, or one plastic grocery bag. You know, condoms, lube, wet wipes, etc.

I came home yesterday to find my room empty and sex bag relocated. She said nothing but it was clear she had seen and moved it. We're kind of even because she recently bought a vibrator on the family amazon prime account and accidentally used my credit cars. There is now an unspoken agreement between us to not mention it. My SO and best friend had a good laugh at my embarrassment. Just remember to hide your sex bags better.

TL;DR my mom found my sex bag but I also know about her recent vibrator purchase so we're even in the worst way."
"TIFU By Having Sex with My GF


Disclaimer: I initially posted this in r/teenagers an hour ago

Backround Info:

My (17M) GF (17F) have been dating for 7 months as of today. We're our first actual bf/gfs to each other. Since we couldn't do anything special for our 6 months due to a scheduling issue we decided to do something special today. That special thing was sex - losing our virginities to each other.

What happened?

Our parents are pretty strict. Her mom is sort of accepting of us as a couple, and her dad thinks that I'll turn her into a slut. She's Asian. My parents on the other hand don't know about the relationship at all because if I told them, they'd probably force me to break up cause dating ""isn't something that I should be doing at this age"". Up until this point today I have never been in my girlfriend's house because of how her dad is. Today both of her parents left for a trip in a city four hours away in the States (we live in a border town in Canada) and we thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to fuck while they were gone. Oh boy, we were very wrong.

Half an hour after her parents leave the house, I arrive and at first we just cuddled on the couch watching TV. Suffice it to say, it escalated from there, clothes were taken off, and a condom packet opened. I won't really get into the details cause it doesn't matter anyway. While on the couch, fucking we noticed a blue light shining across the room, turns out the in-home camera was activated (her family has one of those Xiaomi in-home camera systems that light up when someone is checking the feed). We stoped - knowing we were fucked. At this point we disconnect the camera thinking it was just auto recording or some shit, and tried to figure out how to wipe the video from the cloud using the Xiaomi app on her phone. Turns out, it wasn't recording, it was something way worse - her parents wanted to check on the house from her phone.

We put our clothes back on, and we both burst out crying. We know that her parents would do something bad. 20 minutes later her parents arrive (they turned away from thei journey) and a lot of yelling happened. Her mother seemed to be more understanding, and liked that I put on a condom, but her father literally chased me out of the house, threatened to get a restraining order on me, and grounded my girlfriend.

TL;DR: Decided to fuck gf in her house, we forgot about the live cameras, and her parents found out. We're fucked."
"TIFU-Apparently it's not normal-Tomatoes


Today I fucked up by not realizing I've been allergic to tomatoes my entire life. 

I made a sandwich today that included tomatoes. Afterwards as I'm munching on slices of tomatoes I asked my husband if he gets hives from tomatoes too. Of course I get ""What the hell are you talking about?"".  I continued to explain to him that its because tomatoes are acidic and it can irritate the skin. I then explained to him that  whenever i touch them, and eat them I break out into hives. I worked at a coffee shop for 6 years and handled them daily. I just got used to the pain and if the reaction got too bad I would either put on gloves or have someone else make the food. 

As I'm explaining it to him the hives start popping up on my fingers and elbows and I start involuntarily scratching. Nothing that I havent experienced everytime I eat tomatoes. As I'm looking at them popping up he goes ""What the fuck, you're allergic to them!"" And then the lightbulb went off in my head that he was right. 

I cant believe I've gone 22 years handling and eating tomatoes and not realizing I was allergic. I always thought it a was normal/common reaction...because y'know tomatoes are acidic.


TL;DR: Went 22 years not realizing I was allergic to tomatoes."
"TIFU by trying to surprise my girlfriend in the shower


Obligatory: this happened like 3 months ago.

My gf, her mom, and I drove out to visit her uncle and were staying at his house for a few days. The night we arrive, my gf tells me that she's going to take a shower and goes down to the only bathroom in the house. After about 20 minutes, feeling a little mischievous, I sneak down and head to the bathroom so scare her in she shower. Quietly I enter and rip the shower curtains open. To my surprise its her mom.. she shouts ""what are you doing?! I shout ""I'm so sorry I though you were (gf)"" and I bolt out. I enter the bedroom and find my gf is sitting there in her bath robe dying of laughter. 

I still can't look at her mom in the eye..

TLDR: I tried to surprise my gf in the shower but surprised her mom instead."
"TIFU by asking where the condoms were


So this actually happened today. I was up early this morning and decided to go to my local 24hr discount supercenter. You know the one, the mart that has walls. Anyway I went to pick up a couple items and of course ended up getting more items then intended. On a whim I decided to get a box of condoms, I had read on reddit about this one brand that was pretty good and apparently the brand I had always used in the past were shit. I perused the health and beauty as well as the pharmacy area for about 30 minutes. I can never find shit in these stores and knew it was somewhere in one of these sections. Now I've been married for quite some time and we don't use condoms anymore, this was more for curiosity sakes. I'm not really shy but I knew I was going to have to ask someone where the condoms were and suddenly felt like a 16 year old boy. 

I had walked past a lady probably in her early to mid forties about a dozen times at this point and figured what the hell. So I walk over to her and apologize for having to ask, but where are the condoms located? She immediately responds with a bit of a lisp and points to her ears, she then says can you write it down? At this point I just wanted to walk away, but I knew this would appear rude so I reluctantly write down ""condoms?"". She goes ""ah"" smiles and starts walking down the aisle as if she knows exactly where they were. Relieved I follow along. She then stops, looks at me, and says ""for shaving?"" and makes a hand gesture for shaving your face. Again I'm ready to bail but she continues walking to another aisle to another associate. There were a couple other customers in the aisle with the employee. This woman decides to take her piece of cardboard with ""condoms?"" written on it and display it like a limo driver at an airport looking for passengers. I was mortified...everyone is looking at me. Thankfully associate #2 says oh they're right here and goes to the next aisle....they only had one brand and it wasn't the one I was looking for. Mission failed.

TLDR: Sex ed skipped a generation."

"TIFU I forgot to turn off text message preview and notification on my laptop during a presentation. Nasty text messages from an FWB popped up during my talk and were viewed by my co-workers.


I got to a work meeting a few minutes late. I very quickly plugged my computer in to the AV system and projected my computer screen onto the big screen so I can start my talk. Unfortunately, I forgot to turn off text message preview and notification on my laptop because I was in such a hurry.

During the talk, a new FWB of mine texted me from his office saying he was bored and ultra horny. He then sent rapid fire texts talking about the nasty things he was going to do to me and my impending “anal destruction” once he gets his big hands on me this weekend. The notification banners kept coming up with each text and the “preview message” function was turned on, so everyone in the audience was able to read them. By the time I noticed (laptop was on mute), it was too late.

No one said anything. There were no questions or comments after my talk. Everyone rushed out of the conference room. I am hoping this is a dream and I will wake up any second now. If there is a God, right about now would be a good time to intervene. I’ve been a good person all my life. Just saying.

Ok so like most of these posts this didn't happen today. This actually happened quite a while ago when I was 17. There's a TLDR at the bottom too because this is gonna be pretty long. So one night, I was in the mood to masturbate because what else do teenagers do. However, I decided that jerking off in the traditional way was too boring. It's to basic. No, I had to get creative with it. So I sat down and started brainstorming and after some time I had a genius idea. I was gonna MacGyver a giant fleshlight.

In my mind, this idea was way too good to pass up, so I began construction immediately. I took two pillows off of my bed,  put them on top of one another on the floor. I knew that I wasn't going to be able to use this like a regular fleshlight because if I held the pillows and fucked them that way there wouldn't be any pressure on my dick. Removing the entire point of this thing. **Pleasure**. 

When I put the pillows on the floor, I was trying to slide my dick into the space where the two pillows met. I noticed two things here. Firstly, the pillows cases on these pillows were too rough and secondly fucking the pillows on the floor placed them directly under me and when I thrusted my peehole would open because I have a parabola dick and that hurt like a bitch because my mushroom tip rubbed against the top pillow. To solve the peehole problem, I knew that I needed to move the pillows up to dick level that way I could just slide it in. Sure my peehole might still open but at least I'd be able to work around it that way. So, I put my laundry basket underneath the pillows and that solved the problem. Now I could fuck the pillows doggystyle. To solve the second problem I put a dashiki that my mom gave me as a gift in between the pillows and opened the bottom of the shirt and wrapped it around the opening. That way when I slid in my dick would be inside the shirt. This solved that problem because the dashiki was made of silk.

This thing was coming along nicely. If I slid into it and used my thumbs to press down on the pillows so that they would wrap around my peter it actually felt pretty good. However, I didn't want to press my thumbs down on it so I wrapped a belt around the entry space. Btw this turned out to be useless because I still had to press down. 

I feel like my description of this might be oyster shit so recreated the thing with some different materials. The link for that will be under the TL;DR.

My creation was complete. Now it was doggy time. I really wanted to make love to these pillows so I took all my clothes off so it could feel more intimate. Here's where I fucked up. Normally, I would lock the door when I was doing weird shit like this, but in this case I figured that I was gonna be quick so I didn't do it.

I found some porn, placed the laptop next to my bed so that it would be at eye level, got down on my knees, and started fucking.

I was really getting into this thing like I was sweating and shit. I immediately regretted everything when my door burst open. Turns out my mom was doing laundry downstairs, and she decided to be kind and bring my clothes upstairs so that I could put them away. This is the first time she'd EVER done this. And needless to say she never did it again. My mom opened the door to see her naked son fucking pillows from his bed while a video of Mei from Overwatch getting plowed by Coach from Left For Dead played on his laptop. She tossed me my clothes and promptly closed the door. 

I sat there on my floor naked, and just fucking hating myself. I regretted everything that led to this moment. When she finally did confront me about what she saw she only talked about the porn. She said something along the lines of, ""When did you start watching porn?"" And I said some dumb shit like ""well you know boys will be boys hurhurhur."" Since then she hasn't said anything about it, but I KNOW this will pop up again because that's just how she is. At the time, this was mortifying but I find it pretty funny these days.

Oh and btw even after she walked in I still finished. Too much work went into that to not finish in it. I had to throw that dashiki away.

**TL;DR:** I MacGyvered a giant fleshlight using pillows and my mom caught me fucking it. She hasn't said anything about it since but I'm certain that she'll bring it up again.

"TIFU by giving my husband and kids a golden shower.!


So naturally this didn’t actually happen today, and this isn’t my story, but my coworker has given me permission to share her story in first-person as she doesn’t use reddit but this is an amazing fuckup. Here it goes.

My husband and our two kids (two boys aged 4 and 6) were on our way back from an amusement park nearby. We literally were there from open to almost close (10 A.M. to 8 P.M.), and of course, we had taken the interstate to get home as fast as possible. This is where our fuckup began. 

What we had forgotten about, somehow, was that on this stretch of interstate close to our house, they are currently trying to extend two lanes into three. The traffic, even at this time of night, is almost at a dead stop because of construction. This was when I realized that I shouldn’t have drank four souvenir cups of soda without using the restroom... at the amusement park.

So now, we are in traffic, and it’s at a dead stop. I turn to my husband and tell him I have to pee; to which he replies that we can’t stop because the shoulders are closed during construction. I started to panic; realizing I was going to piss my pants. That is, until, I realized my kids had empty McDonald’s cup.

I reach back and grab one, and at this point the traffic had cleared, but we still are 20 minutes away from home, and we live in a rural area, so there’s no where to stop, and the construction goes all the way up to our exit. I finally make the decision to piss in the cup, to my husband’s horror. 

I took the top off of the cup, and dumped the rest of the soda out of the window. The wind whipped it against the car, but didn’t hit me or the kids. If it had, we may not be here today.

I wiggles out of my shorts and got the cup down there, sliding over the edge of my seat so that I could piss. I relieved myself at an awkward angle; until I realized... Shit. I’m going to overflow the cup.

Before I did so, panicking, I lifted the cup up, prepared to poor that out the window too. This was my fuck up. My awful fuck up. You see, I thought the piss would go out just like the soda. I didn’t, however, realize that now my hand was at a different angle, and we were going much, much faster than before. 

I felt the piss mist immediately hit me in my face. My husband automatically started groaning, and my kids immediately started screaming. My oldest asked, ‘Mommy, what was that?!’ And all I could do was look at him and say ‘Buddy, I am so sorry’. Still, I had to piss. I went for round two with the cup as my husband laughed and cried, and my youngest started bawling. He actually got the brunt of it because he was right behind my chair. 

This time I wasn’t going to throw it out the window, but my husband told me to do it because it might spill in the car and make everything worse. He told me to throw it out in the BACK of the window this time.

I did it again. Everyone got a second golden shower. My oldest thinks it’s hilarious and the youngest doesn’t remember. I know I am disgusting and I have learned my lesson.

TL;DR I drank too much soda at an amusement park, pissed in a cup in the car, tried to toss piss out the window, sprayed my whole family."
"TIFU by carrying my drunk girlfriend


This happened late 2018 whilst on holiday in Tenerife..

Me and my girlfriend had been out partying at some bars/clubs for our last night before having to fly home the next day. We had drank a lot but decided to leave before we got to the black out stage

As we started walking back to the apartment my girlfriend was complaining that her new heels were hurting her feet, so me being the kind gentleman I am I kindly offered her to climb onto my back so I could carry her.

We hadn't walked very far and she kept falling down so my genius drunk brain thought it would be a good idea to lean over on the count to 3 whilst she climbs up...

Not a good idea. Very bad.

We both went down and having both our weight I landed face first and busted my lip and eye, luckily all my teeth were still all in place and my girlfriend had only hurt her knee. 

This happened right in front of two taxi drivers and they didnt even laugh or offer to help. They're probably used to seeing drunk tourists doing stupid shit.

After getting up and realizing we were both in a bad mess and that it was gonna be a long walk home some kind stranger walked past and kind of realised what had happened and gave us €5 to get a taxi back.

The next day I had to travel to the airport hungover and with a busted face (balloon lip). I cant imagine what people were thinking when they looked at me

I might be able to attach a photo for proof of my face  if this gets any attention.

TL;DR I carried my drunk girlfriend while also drunk and fell over causing me to smash my face on the concrete."
