"TIFU by hanging out in my younger sister room at the wrong time.


 This is not actually a major fuck up but it still a fuck up.

 Let me be clear, I usually hangs out at my younger sister room when she's not using the room. Well it's AC is the best in my house. She only locks the door when she's changing and something like that. 

One day, I wanted to play my phone on her bed and found out she's in the toilet. The room is not locked so I just entered and plays my phone. 

After a while, I heard flushing. So she has finished her business. I got out from her bed because I didn't want her to bitch about me staying in her room. ( She usually don't care. Sometimes she asks me to get out). 

As I'm reaching for the door, the toilet door opens and she was not wearing any bottomwear. I quickly swayed elsewhere whilst she's screaming ( Not loud as those in animes) and asks me to get out embarrassingly. 

I got out and she's closed the door and I heard her screaming sleep slowly and said I'm the worst.

 I knocked the door back to apologize. She opens and I said I'm sorry and she forgives me. 

Then she screamed slowly ( nobody's heard it) "" Mooom! (Me) is a pervert! "" .

 I was like Wtf. Shut up. It was just an accident. 

Now the she's not like disgusted of me or something and we never talked about it again. 

Lesson : Lock your doors.  Seriously. 

TL;DR: You know that cliche anime thing when guys entered  rooms at the wrong time?

Well happened to me with my younger sister. "
"TIFU by ignoring penis pains


Obligatory this did not happen today, but 2 days ago.  

So last week I was having sex with my S/O and had a bit of pain at the tip of my penis. I thought it must of been because we didn't have proper lube and kept going. We finish the act and go on with our day.  This was fuckup one.  

Fast foward to 2 days ago where we're about go have some sexy time and we didn't have lube. So we just use spit. I go to put it in and as it goes in I feel this sharp pain. I scream out ""FUCK"".  

Girlfriend asks if I'm okay and I say yeah I think we just need lube that's all. Then I look down at my hand (holding my dick) covered in blood. I thought it must of been from her so I release my dick and then there's a LOT of  blood running quite obviously from my dick onto my thighs.  

I had torn my banjo string... and it hurt like a motherfucker. Now I am here scared to get a boner incase the surge of blood comes out of the tear and I'm in pain when I piss. 

TL;DR: Ignored sexual pain, end up tearing my banjo string with A LOT of blood coming out."

"TIFU by expressing my feelings (TRIGGER WARNING?)


So, I'm a gay guy, a pretty normal thing. Call me Jhonathan for the time being.

I started to like a guy from my class (Don't worry, you'll have a shot at his background), let's call him Mark.

So, I started liking Mark, and tried to get his attention through text, and when I expressed my feelings towards him, he blocked me and didn't talk or look to me for several days. Ok, kind of a douchey attitude, I guess, at least at first... One day, after apologizing for what happened, we started talking to each other again, and I once said some of my friends thought he was gay, and he started ignoring my text messages. Ok, fragile masculinity, maybe?

But it started getting kind of weird when a teacher called me by the side after class and said:  
""Hey, Jhonathan, I noticed something weird, when I interact with the class, and you start interacting with me, Mark gets a frown on his face, as if he was sad. Is there anything wrong between you and him?""

I obviously said no, because there wasn't anything particularly wrong on my side, and there was nothing too bad on his side either. And out of sheer curiosity, I texted him about it, he just totally freaked out and blocked me again, this time even if he was close to his friends he would ignore or dismiss me, which was extra weird.

Some months into the future (maybe 2 months), a friend of his (and also a friend of mine) called me by the side and said:

""Hey, Jhonny, you know Mark? So... He was sexually abused several times as a kid by his uncle, and I saw he was acting kind of weird towards you, and knowing you're a gay guy, it clicked everything together. So... Yeah, if you like him, that's why he's acting kind of cold towards you. He doesn't actually hate you, but he feels fear and disgust towards gay guys who like him because it all calls back to his uncle. Don't feel bad for what he's doing towards you, he's just a traumatized guy, and you're just a passionate guy""

My world fell apart. It's been 8 months since he first caught my attention, and since then, I can't stop thinking about him. I really do love him, and don't want anything to go wrong for him, yet I called back an old trauma because I forced my fucking feelings towards him.

I'm sorry for the long post, and kind of unfunny sad story, but I just had to vent somewhere."

"TIFU by being really drunk and hitting on a coworker’s girlfriend at our Christmas party


So the night starts with our business’s Christmas party which had a full open bar. You name the drink, they were gonna make it. I just stuck with the classic whiskey and coke, but the pours were extremely heavy. I intended on getting pretty drunk since one of my roommates and my other roommate’s girlfriend were the designated drivers of the night. Everyone is having a great time at the party and then we start talking about going out afterwards as well. Party ends and we go to a bar. Well, this is where I pretty much don’t remember anything, except for the fact that I was just casually talking with my coworker’s girlfriend and then my stupid drunk self thought it would be smart to hit on her. 

So apparently, with my friends filling in the holes some, I was getting really damn close to her and even tried to kiss her. She obviously turned that down, but it didn’t change anything. We were still talking a lot. Come to find out, supposedly my coworker saw me do this. He was also super wasted, but apparently he just kinda blew it off. What I’m scared of the most right now is having to go into work and see him and pray that he doesn’t remember or his girlfriend didn’t mention it to him or that he just doesn’t care. It seems like he would’ve done something drunkenly more so than sober, which gives me some hope it’ll be all good, but I genuinely feel like such a dick. Drunk me has never even thought about this before and it pisses me off that I would stoop to such a dickish level when I get that drunk. I think he’ll more likely than not just make a joke out of it like my friends did, but I really feel bad for putting her in such an unnecessary and uncomfortable situation. 

TL;DR: I got extremely drunk at my business’ Christmas party and tried to make a move on the girlfriend of a coworker. I feel really bad and I’m hoping he won’t be upset about it when I see him again. "

"TIFU by saving too many posts on reddit


tl;dr: I saved too many posts on reddit and I need to create a new one
Today was more the day I realized that I had TOO many reddit posts saved which I never took care of in my time . Even more, most of them (like 80-90 %) were NSFW posts...and not stuff I actually needed to have for later to read or see.  Well, I did see many of those posts later but that's not the point. Even more I thought Reddit enabled you to see ALL saved posts but it just stops at 950 and to see the ones later you have to remove those before.
Now I'd like to make a fresh profile so that stuff like this doesn't happen again as I need reddit. Kind of a pity considering this was my first ever reddit profile ,and also I have a nice amount of karma,but still I will not delete this one. Do you have any similar experiences with reddit accounts?"
"TIFU by not doing what my doctor told me to.


TIFU by not doing what my doctor told me to do. For clarification, this TIFU has been happening for several days in a row...

I have been seeing a Chiropractor for months now. Since September I think. We started by going every day for a week, then two times a week, and now I only go once a month because I'm getting better and only really need ""maintenence"" visits.

I got stepped on by a horse most viciously when I was about 10 years old, and my back has never been ""okay"" since. 

I deal with a lot of pinchy pains, and sometimes I can't walk, sit, stand or lay down for too long. 

Well we discovered my spine was all sorts of messed up. The spacing between vertebre was all fuckered up and my lower back has such an extreme curve to it that if I hadn't gone to the Chiro, I was on my way to dealing with a ""slipped disk"" and the potential need for surgeries in the future, as he put it to me. 

I'm supposed to be stretching certian ways, daily, but I haven't been, and that's the fuckup here. 

At my core I am a lazy person, and also excersize feels awful because I'm just in such a weakened state, but I NEED to do it if I want my back better, and I do. But it doesn't help that I have so many stretches to do that I can't remember them. Thanks to my anti-depressants, my memory is shit-tastic these days.

My back is getting better and worse at the same time right now. The curve is exactly 1.3mm worse according to Xrays, however the spacing between my discs is WAY better. On my first round of Xrays my spine looked like a trainwreck compared to a normal one. Check it out [here](https://imgur.com/a/dEveVU9) I'd post the new one so you guys can compare but I don't have it in my email yet. 

Hhhhh. I need a mix of tough love and understanding guys. We've been trying so hard to get me healthy. I'm seeing a LOT of doctors (God is it expensive) and I can't afford to fuck this up but I am by not stretching. I can't go back to the chiro too much either, because on top of my need for him I have to see an OBGYN for the first time ASAP, I need about $10,000 in dental work, and now my doctor is saying I should REALLY go see a phyciatrist. We only have so much money to do these things, and it's not much **at all**.

I'm scheduling an appointment come Monday, and I'm going to have him go over my stretches with me again and adjust me so I can hopefully be out of pain. 

Root for me guys. &lt;3 

TL;DR
I'm not stretching like my chiropractor told me to and, who would have guessed? My back is getting worse because I'm not doing it. I need a mix of tough love and encouragement. "
