"TIFU by going down a Reddit rabbit hole.


This didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and I bought a new car. I was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. Don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.   

I came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse Reddit while I'm taking care of my business. Most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. I can't remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about ""The Donkey Show."" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there,and I wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading. 

Someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, ""What the hell, I've never seen this sort of thing before."" So I clicked.

As weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a black man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in. 

I finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

She was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, ""What the hell is this?"" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by black......www.pornhub.com"". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.

After about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I'm pretty sure I'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...

She said to me one day, ""I know you won't leave me for another woman, but I'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

I doubt she will ever let this one go...

TL;DR I went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine."
"TIFU by looking up my school bully


So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed. 

TLDR: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than I ever will."
"TIFU by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.


Obligatory just over a week ago comment. So I have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we’ve only been together three months. And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

Ragebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I’d take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

I fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn’t care and...

I broke my back.

And then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

Woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

TL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face."
"TIFU by telling a girl on a first date that i work with deaf children and know sign language


 

So first of all i’ll start off with a little context… I don’t usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. However, i’ve just come back to University for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. She had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call Stacey. Now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at University, but i always had an excuse. Now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my Uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. 

So i get shown a few pictures of Stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? So she gives me Staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. So much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. Now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i'm filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i’m usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. However i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i’ve never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.

So i meet Stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i’m full of nerves but i’m ready for the date. We get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. Im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. At the best of times i’m a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i’m speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. I know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we’re on a night out. Now here comes the fuck up. 

So being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i’m growing louder and louder by the minute. So much so that Stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). Now i’m not an angry person by any means, but i can’t begin to count the amount of times I've been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i’d have enough. So instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on Stacey. I don’t know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was “Well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i’m used to having to speak really loudly, i’ve actually just come from there before our date”. 

Now if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. Once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. So far it doesn’t seem that bad, until Stacey says something along the lines of “wow, i’m really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?”. Drunk me thinking i’d got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. However, what i didn’t expect was for Stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently LOVE to meet me as she’s never dated a guy before who can do sign language!

Honestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. I just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don’t know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. I quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. So now Stacey thinks i know sign language and what’s even better is that she can’t wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she’s dating!

Ive tried Youtube videos but all i’ve managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. I don’t have the balls to tell her and i really don’t know what to do. Im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she’s even suggesting we Face Time her brother when we’re next together so i can have a conversation with him. I just feel like a dick now and i don’t want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don’t think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. 

TL;DR Im a loud idiot when i’ve had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. Turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. I don’t have the first clue about how to sign and i don’t have the balls to tell her the truth because i don’t want hurt her or her brothers feelings."
"TIFU by receiving 2nd degree burns on my butthole.


So this happened roughly about 4 hours ago. Insert generic ""I'm on mobile"" text here. 

So I was getting ready for work and stepping out of the shower.
I don't know about you guys, but I really like to use a hair dryer on
every part of my body. I've got hair all over my body, so it makes sense I guess.

I use the hairdryer to dry my (head) hair, then my torso and then my legs... and then...
my butt. You see, I'm a guy and there's some hair down there. It's not always
easy to dry it with a towel so I just use the hair dryer. 

I would get out of the shower, use a towel to dry myself as much as possible 
and then let the hair dryer do the rest.

For the last 10 years this technique has worked PERFECTLY FINE.. except for today.

You see, somehow my hands were still wet. For some reason I didn't notice this. So
while I was spreading my butt cheeks to dry the hair between them the hair dryer slipped
out of my hand. I quickly cought the power cable but by doing that the hair dryer was rammed
directly between my buttcheeks while it was STILL ON.

The hair dryer was on the highest setting and the moment it hit my butthole I was shocked.
I instantly clenched my buttcheeks together while the hairdryer was still in there and running.

God, I can't tell you how much this fucking hurt. It still does. It's literally the worst pain.
Like, I know the anus is relatively sensitive but this was just PURE HELL. The pain was so horrible
I was literally unable to loosen my butt cheeks. The hairdryer was blowing hot, and I mean HOT air directly on my butthole
for about 7 full seconds. I managed to get my shit together and pull the plug.

But by the time I pulled the plug the damage was already done. I fell on the floor and puked all over
the place. The pain was unbearable. I was crying, screaming and I think I even might've passed out for
a couple of seconds at a time.

I was laying on my bathroom floor for 30 miniutes trying to somehow live through this immeasurable pain.

It was horrible. But after half an hour of laying there I realized I had to move, this had to be treated, so I tried to reach for my phone to call help. But when I tried to crawl to my phone I realized that the hair dryer was STILL
between my butt cheeks!

So I tried to pull it out and that was the second time I puked due to the pain. When I got it out it was covered
in bloody/burnt off parts of my butt's flesh. I have no clue how it looks down there but it can't be any better than
how I'm feeling right now.

I eventually managed to call my girlfriend. She drove me to the hospital.

So... that's basically it. I'm currently laying in a hospital bed. The wound has been 'treated'. It was so humiliating.
The pain is still horrible but they gave me painkillers so I guess that'll help.
This is literally the worst day of my life. I've not only felt the WORST pain you can imagine, I've also never been
more embarrassed/ashamed.

But I really have to give credit to the nurses/doctor who treated me. They did perfect. They tried to cheer me up
and they were totally nice. I'm so grateful.

Also, I really hope I could explain this properly but if you had problems here's a visual depiction of what went down:

https://imgur.com/a/YInsqGN

So, if you're reading this you've probably stopped laughing by now. So thank you for reading this giant wall of text.

I'll try to keep you guys updated.

TL;DR: I received 2nd degree burns on my butthole after I accidentally rammed my hair dryer between my butt cheeks."
"TIFU by being a little too honest with my much younger coworker.....


Dude [17] got his finger stuck in a plastic soda lid and was pretty much panicking about it and couldn’t get it off (he has serious anxiety). It was like that scene in the Saw movies or a Chinese finger trap. The more he tried to escape the worse it got. However!....He and his girlfriend just found out they were pregnant and I knew they were really stressed out about it, but my [27] insensitive ass pretty much yelled at him, “You’re about to have a child! If you can’t figure this out on your own you’re screwed.”
His response, “She isn’t pregnant anymore.”
I just about died inside...
All the other coworkers just started laughing theirselves death. I apologized profusely and he took it well but I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive myself for it. Poor kid didn’t deserve that!!!

TL;DR, coworker got physically stuck, I told him he won’t be a good father if he couldn’t get out of that situation......"
"TIFU by showing my son an anti-drug video from the 90s


This happened last week.

My oldest (12) is in middle school, and one of his elective classes is a health class. The teacher sent home some info about the class, including that they’d be discussing drugs and sex over the course of the semester. We had to sign off on it or opt for an independent study if we weren’t comfortable with such topics. We don’t shy away from discussing this stuff, so whatever, we signed and didn’t think much of it. 

Last week, my son told us that they talked about drug use that day. He said the teacher told them that half of the class would probably be offered marijuana by the end of the year and that most of them would accept it and throw their lives away on drugs. She said it was one of the most dangerous substances out there and ruins the lives of everyone who takes it. Oh dear lord. 

Now, I’ve already discussed drugs to a degree with my son before, but he was still freaked out about all these drugs he thinks he’s gonna be offered now. We talked about what she said at length and then sat down at the computer to pull up some drug statistics and info.  While we were reading/talking, I mentioned the War on Drugs and the dramatic TV ad campaigns in the 90s when I was his age. He was curious, so I showed him a video of that chick from The Babysitters Club movie on YouTube. The “your brain on drugs” video where she smashes an egg and wrecks a kitchen. 

After we finished talking, I drafted an email to his teacher saying that I wanted to schedule an appointment to discuss some of the content they were reviewing in class. (I heard back the next day and will see her this week.)

In addition to my son, I have two other kids. One is 9 and the other is 5 (and on the spectrum) and just started kindergarten. The next morning, I got a call from the principal at the elementary school saying I needed to come in immediately to discuss something the 5 year old said. He wouldn’t go into details on the phone, so I headed down to the school, wondering what the hell she said that could’ve been severe enough that we couldn’t discuss it over the phone. 

When I got there, I was directed to the principal’s office. I asked what was going on, but he said to wait for her teacher to come down before we started. I was pretty freaked out. We were worried she might have some issues adjusting to a full-day program, but we were in the third week of school and had nothing but positive feedback so far. 

When the teacher came in and we began talking, the principal asked if there was any drug use in the home. Wth? I told her no, and my kid’s teacher said that my daughter made a comment about taking drugs.

“I opened up rug time by asking about the kids’ mornings. (Your daughter) said that she had drugs for breakfast.” 

The principal chimed in and made a comment about how they were all concerned and needed to get to the bottom of it. 

I wasn’t expecting that, and I sputtered and said that of course she didn’t have drugs for breakfast. The principal asked if she has access to any medications. She gets a multivitamin, but that’s it. 

“We give her a gummy vitamin with her breakfast.” 

The teacher said that she asked my daughter if she meant she took vitamins at breakfast and she said “no.” 

I told them I didn’t know what she was talking about and that she had eggs and toast for breakfast. And then a lightbulb went off—the talk I had with my son the day before and the video I showed him with the girl smashing an egg. That had to be it.

I explained about the video I showed my son the day before. My daughter was in the room, but I didn’t think she was paying attention. I pulled it up on my phone to show them. The principal seemed skeptical, but told me to wait while he talked to my daughter to see if it was a misunderstanding. 

A few minutes later, the principal came in smiling. 

“It appears that (your daughter) things ‘drugs’ is another word for ‘eggs.’” He chuckled, as did the teacher. “In the future, I’d suggest that you be more careful about the media she is exposed to. This could’ve had a very different ending at a school with less understanding leadership.” 

I tried to laugh it off, but felt like I was going to throw up. I should’ve already learned by now that kids are always listening, and there’s my reminder. 

TL;DR: My son’s teacher dramatized drugs, and I showed him a video of an anti-drug campaign from the 90s where a girl smashed an egg. My 5-year-old overheard and thought the word drug was a synonym for egg. She told the teacher she had drugs for breakfast, so I ended up in the principal’s office."
"TIFU by letting my husband show me something interesting.


This just happened. I'm still trying to process....and to not pee my pants.

My husband went outside to put out the trash, since its midnight he wore a head lamp. He comes back inside looking a little pale but also like he found something really cool. 

Turns out he read somewhere on reddit that you can see a spider's eye shine in the grass. He told me about it and said it was interesting. 

Now here's the fuck up. I asked him to show me.  I should probably mention that I have arachnophobia. Like legit pee my pants, cry, throw my kids out of my way while I run for my life arachnophobia. I thought I could handle it. I thought it would be one sparkly reflection. I thought it would be ok cuz I wouldn't actually *see* a spider. 

I was wrong.

So very very *very* wrong. There had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. I'm not sure how I made it back in the house but I was told screaming was involved. Now I'm terrified of leaving my house. 

TLDR spiders. Arachnophobia.  Never leaving my house again."
"TIFU by wearing jeans with a hole in them


This just happened minutes ago. I’m in a children’s hospital with my wife and son because he’s been having severe asthma issues.

My wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and I’ve just been sitting in one of the chairs. As people kept coming in, I noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. I figured I had some food on my face or something and didn’t think too much of it.

Suddenly, I’m sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, “What’s that between your legs?”

I look down, and there’s a pink ball between my legs. Confusion quickly turns to shock as I realize that pink ball is one of MY balls. One of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

I don’t have a spare pair of pants here, so now I’m just sitting with my legs tightly together like I’m wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn’t stay here long.

TL;DR I found out I had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair."
"TIFU by sending a nude to my work group chat


This happened a few minutes ago and I'm shaking and gonna try to cope through this. 

So I was in the shower when I get a snap from a girl I've been talking to for a while and its nsfw to say the least. I replied and we went back and forth a few times. This is where the fu happens. 

It's one of my coworkers birthdays today so were all chatting and whatnot. So I text there and say happy birthday and get back to my lady friend. 

I go to send her a picture and her name doesnt bump to the top. THE FUCKING GROUPCHAT UPDATES SAYING MY PICTURE HAS BEEN SENT. I panic, throw my phone across the room lay on the ground in the fetal position. My heart starts pounding. I quickly grab my phone and leave the gc, only to get a text saying ""why would you send that in the gc"". I told them I'm sorry and I need to sulk and never be talked to again, they added me back. They're giving me shit and I'm traumatized by this. 

Happy birthday to George (that's not his real name), hope you enjoyed your present

The internet is awful and that's my 2 cents. Be safe kids.  

TLDR; Got frisky with a girl, now my coworkers now what my dick looks like."
"TIFU By Hugging My Friend's Sister!


I feel so embarrassed even typing about this even though this happened like an hour ago. I still can't believe I can be this stupid. Me and my friend had  decided that we would meet at a certain point so that we could go have lunch to a place which was close to that point. He told me that even his sister would come along with him. And I was fine with it.

NOTE: The problem was that I couldn't seem to remember how she looked like because I rarely met her as she stays away from the family.

So back to the present, after sometime I hear someone say Hi and I turn back to see who it was. It was my friend's sister who was walking towards me with her arms outstretched. I commit to the hug because if I didn't it would get awkward. So I hug her and it seemed she really wasn't into it. So I step back from her and check what's wrong.

Now I realize I did two mistakes. 1. She wasn't my friend's sister. Because my friend was exactly behind her and with him was a girl. And she was already laughing about it. 2. She actually wanted to hug a person who was behind me and henceforth she extended her arms.

After that they were kinda shocked, I couldn't really tell what their emotions were because I just walked away.

TL;DR :  After that embarrassment I hugged my friend and ' her sister '. And they mocked me until our lunch got over."
"TIFU by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.


So, I like to think i'm an O.K mom. I don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. He's fifteen so I always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

Well, yesterday he left to go to the McDonald's across the street with some friends. I assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as I knew I was alone. I decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""Mom, can-"" question following.

I'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while Metallica is blasting in my ears. I start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

I decided to toss his gym clothes I just finished washing on his bed while I was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS HOME. I walk straight in without knocking and I'm horrified.

My 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. What the fuck.

He instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. I set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

I asked ""What were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

He's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

I start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

He looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. I asked ""Is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" He's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

Finally I just have to say ""It's pretty obvious what you were doing and I need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

Him: ""I wasn't trying to throw up!""

Me: ""Then what were you doing?""

Him: ""I needed to know if I have a gag reflex!""

I'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. He blurts, ""I'm gay!"" I'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

It clicks.

I immediately wish I hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""I'm sorry, it's okay, I support you completely, I'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

Dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""I'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". He planned to come out in college. I had no idea he thought I'd react that way and assured him I'd love him no matter what.

Apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. I'm relieved but mostly want to forget I ever saw that. At least it brought us closer.


TL;DR walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay."
"TIFU by having my son clean his room.


To start off this is my wife's story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. 

Some back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. Why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  So the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. We are truly lucky to have this child. 

Well at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. Telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. So we get him some pull ups and start that phase. We also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). 

Que the day of said FU. The 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. She would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. Well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. 

Oh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. Hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean It up for me while I make lunch. So the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. It's at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn't have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, ""Mom! Can slime go bad?"" She walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. 

So after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. Then let's him play on the switch for the rest of the day. 

Tldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime."
"TIFU by looking at a USB stick that my dad lost.


So, this just happened and I am still a little shaken but need to vent.

First thing to note is that I am *painfully* impulsive, I leap and then look far too often. 

Mostly, I do fine. I am on some quite good medication, and as long as I can make it to my next prescription, it works. I have reasonable control over what I do, but when I saw a USB that was left out... I just *had* to know what it was for. So, not a problem. I could just load it up. Have a quick look and go about my life without a care, it was probably going to be some family history archives or something. He likes that stuff.

Some context, I don't live with my father. He walked out on my mother two or three years ago, as he had already started on his new relationship. A year ago I moved for university and now I live only a short train away, so he has helped me move into my new place. 

So, I have this USB and know he hides a lot of stuff. I want to know. I need to know. We didn't talk much for a few years and he changed in his new relationship. So I open the file system and there are three folders: 

&gt;Gash, Puns, Stash

I work my way from the end inwards, glancing at the thumbnails one level down.

Stash: Boring, Family photos in folders with one initial per person.

Puns: Looked like a recording, ripped off of a DVR or something. He is fairly tech savvy

Now, I was a little cautious with this last one. I believe in one's own ""tastes"" being between yourself and whomever you share it with. But heck, I was just going to peek and he had pissed me off the other day about my girlfriend. So, I look.   


Nothing special. 

Folders, each with a name. ( I assume of the model in the photo-shoots)  

One does catch my eye though: Fakes.

Do I look? Yes. Should have I? Fuck no.  


Folders, each with and initial and a few stray photos.

In Stash he had some of the same initials. I remembered that B had pictures of my girlfriend in. It did. Poorly photo-shopped images of my girlfriend in various positions. All created in June this year.  
Other subjects that I remembered were in the family photos were: My sister (K), My girlfriend's mother (J) and my cousin (V)  


Now I am stuck knowing that my father went to the effort of photo-shopping photos of my girlfriend of seven years, my family and a bunch of other people.  


I want to die.

TLDR: My cheating bastard-father finds incest and his son's gf sexually pleasing and makes shitty photoshop"
"TIFU by losing weight and hanging out the washing.


So this actually happened maybe ten minutes ago.

Bit of context. My neighbours are extreme curtain twitchers. Our back gardens are currently open to each other since a fence blew down and neither of us has the money to replace it just yet.

I'm a big guy, about 6ft1 (186cm) and I've been heavy for some time but when the scales touched 25 stone (350 lbs, 160kg ) I figured it was time to do something. So I've been eating better and losing some weight. I haven't lost much but it's enough to make my clothes' waistbands irritatingly unable to stay put.

Today I'm lounging in some loose comfortable pants (soft material made for lounging or sleeping - decorated with dangermouse for anyone who cares) which are quite old with little elastic left in the waist. The wife is out with the kids and I'm getting on with some work. I've already had a strange interaction with next door neighbour (check it out over on choosingbeggars if u like.)

This being Britain, the sun quickly disappears and I hear the rain begin. ""Oh no"" I think, ""the washing is out on the line and if it gets wet again I won't hear the end of it."" So I head out and go to bring in the washing, I reach up for the first piece and my slightly smaller than usual waist betrays me. My arms are in the air unclipping pegs and my pants slide down. Now the unfortunate side is that I am also blessed with an arse and hips unable to keep pants up (thanks mam). I can't stop them without dropping washing on the now wet ground. 

You guessed it, those soft comfy pants are now heading for my knees, taking my also loose boxer shorts with them. My package is now floating free and easy in the late summer breeze.

I rapidly fold up the item of clothing and shove it in the bag, and go to yank my pants up, when I suddenly lock eyes with my neighbour. She's there at her window, twitching aside her blinds, ogling my junk. Might have only been a fraction of a second but it felt like hours we at each other through that window for.

Now this woman is in her sixties and lives next door with her son, both of whom I'm fairly sure have learning disabilities. We've had several strange interactions with them over the years, but I think her viewing my cold-shrivelled pecker dangling in her window is possibly the worst.

I'm sure the wife will howl with laughter when I tell her. 

TLDR: lost weight recently causing my pants to fall down while collecting hung washing, exposing myself to a most neighbour."
"TIFU by having phone sex with my uncle



To be fair, this actually happened earlier this week and I’ve been debating if I wanted to post this or not, but now that I can laugh about it, I’m comfortable with others laughing along side me.

I work as a Phone Sex Operator, and have been doing so for the last 5 years. I rarely ever really remember my callers, but this was a call I’ll never forget.I took a call this past weekend from a gentlemen who was quite a bit older than myself, who lived in the neighbouring city. That was about all I knew from my caller other than the name he gave me, ‘Joseph.’ I didn’t think anything of the call, it seemed pretty standard. Chit chat for a few minutes and then get down and dirty. However there was something about this call, I felt like I had spoken to this person before, despite my call monitoring sheet (a pop up that shows the user name of the person calling me,) showed me we had never spoken before. 

This past Monday, while having family over for a Labour Day BBQ, I discovered something. My uncle had asked me to call my mom and aunt to ask them something. When I couldn’t get ahold of them by calling my mom, my uncle suggested I called my aunt. Only problem was, she had recently changed her number and I didn’t have the new one. My uncle told me to use his phone, her number would be in his recently called list. I found her number, just two calls UNDER my company’s number under his recently called list. Having recognized the number, I scrolled through to see recently called his and also found the number on Saturday night, roughly around the time I would have been online. If this wasn’t proof enough, it didn’t dawn on my until the yesterday, my uncle’s middle name is Joseph. 


There was no way he would have known it was me because I crop my face out of all my photos online to keep my privacy, and he never will know it was me. I’ll never speak a word of it to him or anyone I personally know. 

TL;DR Had phone sex with my uncle, completely unaware until later that it was him."
"TIFU by sleeping in a loft.


This literally happened last night.  TLDR at the bottom. 

So my husband and I are celebrating our one year anniversary with a “minimoon” since we didn’t take a honeymoon when we got married. 

We decided to go to a romantic touristy island near Canada for the weekend and do sightseeing and eat all the fudge we can before getting diabetes (some of you can probably guess where we’re at by now). 

Now, staying on the island itself is crazy expensive, so I found us a cute little Air B&amp;B “tiny house” style [cabin](https://i.imgur.com/JvUpf4c.jpg) to stay in instead. It’s cute, has a sauna, fire pit, and a loft bed area.  

The drive up was long and uneventful. When we got to the cabin we decided to find a fun place to eat and have a few local beers before turning in. This was my first mistake. 

I ended up drinking four hard ciders of unknown alcohol content and getting a pretty good buzz. 

We decide when we get back to the cabin to just go straight to bed, so we crawl up there and pass out. I slept on the side closest to the tv, farthest from the stairs. This was my second mistake. 

At some point I have to pee. Bad. So I start to get down from the loft. 

But I wasn’t fully awake. 

And I didn’t take the stairs. 

Dear readers, I decided in my half asleep state to climb over the railing (by the tv) because I thought the stairs were there. I come to full consciousness when I crash to the floor HARD. 

I screamed for my dear husband to save me since I didn’t know the damage and still had to pee. He flew down the stairs and helped me get to the bathroom and set me up on the couch for the rest of the night because I was too scared to be up in the loft again. 

Luckily I didn’t break anything (on myself or the cabin) or hit my head, but my hip took the brunt of the fall and we have a full day of sightseeing today. And a seven hour car ride home tomorrow. 

TL;DR: Yeeted myself out of a loft because I forgot where the stairs were."
"TIFU by pitying a poor old woman


This happened over the weekend.

I was waiting for the light to go green when this poor homeless woman approached my car and fucking stood there staring into my soul. She was old and frail and seemed like she was struggling to walk. She was eyeing the can of coke I was drinking and gestured that I share some with her. I rolled down my window and handed her the can. It would've qualified for a beautiful humans being bros moment, if not for the fucking fact that this homeless old hag didn't go for the coke. She snatched my damn watch instead. I kid you not, this cunning old cunt went from old and frail to fast as fuck as soon as she got what she wanted. In an obvious state of panic, I raised my foot off the clutch and forgot the car was still in first gear. Before I could even process what the fuck just happened, I went from being robbed on the road to crashing into a fucking funeral van and spilling coke all over my crotch.

Thank God there was no body in the funeral van because my insurance policy does not cover hauntings. By the way, if any of y'all spot an old homeless woman walking around with a smartwatch, do not make contact, she is not from this world.

TL;DR Offered an old homeless woman some soda but all that cunning old cow wanted was to rob me of my time."
"TIFU by calling a child at my son’s school a Window Licker


One of the benefits of my job is that I work from home every Friday so I get to pick my youngest up from primary/junior school (the other 2 are are in secondary now so can walk home).
I’ve got to know a few of the other parents but there are a couple of other dads who pick their kids up so we’ve kind of gravitated together.

There were a few complaints last term that not enough was being done for the kids who are struggling in their classes (this includes my son. He’s bright enough but gets frustrated when he can’t do something and gives up too easily) and it’s still an issue the parents want to discuss.

The “Dads” group generally don’t talk about school stuff and have more conversations about sport or tech but today one of the mums joined us and brought the subject up, I gave my opinion that it’s not easy for a teacher who has 30 kids to each to try and teach to all levels and the Teaching Assistants spend all of their time teaching the more “challenging” kids.

“Like who?” Says the mum who was with us.

“Like that Simon kid (not his real name of course)” I said. This is a child who once sat in a muddy puddle for 30 minutes on a school outing because he wanted to make sure that the frog (a dead one) in his pocket had enough to drink.

“He’s not that bad,” Said the one of the Dads.

Me - “Kid’s a right Window Licker.” 

*Silence*

*Shuffling of feet and averted gazes clearly meaning that “Simon’s mum was standing right behind me*

To make matters worse I turned around and said “Oh, hi Sandra (not her real name), how’s Simon’s frog doing?”

I now have to explain to my son why he won’t be invited to Simon’s party next month.

It’s at Sandra’s house. You can tell it’s theirs because it has the cleanest windows in the street.

TL;DR I used the phrase “Window Licker” to describe a kid in my son’s class and his mother was standing right behind me,"
