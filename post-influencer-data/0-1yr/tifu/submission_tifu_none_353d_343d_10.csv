"TIFU by spending $300 on laundry.


For reference, I’m a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. I grew up middle class with a very simple family. Right now, I’m traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally I expected to do laundry at some point. I figured most Hilton’s have guest laundry so this shouldn’t be a problem. 

As I’m checking in I ask the front desk, “Do you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?” 

He goes on to tell me they don’t have quarter laundry but their Hilton does have guest laundry. I’d just leave my shit with him and they’d have it done by that evening. 

Me being the simpleton I am thinks it’s complimentary. To be fair, HE SHOULD MENTIONED IT COST A LOT OF MONEY. I mean, based on my reaction alone, that should’ve been some indicator that I was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. Christ, I just asked where the local laundromat was. Of course I don’t have that sort of money. Plus, after he said that, I literally jerked my head back and was like, “Really? How does that work?” And proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how I never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. Not once did he mention cost. Hindsight, of course it cost money. But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. Maybe I’m dumb, but still. He should have mentioned a cost. 

So I go about my day. Get back to the hotel. Get my laundry and thank the girl. As I’m leaving she says, “I’ll just add the cost to your room.” 

I’m taken aback but it happens so fast that I just smile and nod and go to my room. The entire walk up I’m replaying her words in my head. Cost? What cost? It wasn’t until I got to my room that I started to panic. I raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. They charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! The real fucking kicker is that they didn’t even wash nice clothes. Among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts. And my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. It was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. 

Now, I was raised to be polite, so I made sure to tell her I’m not at all mad at her since it’s not her fault, but WHAT THE FUCK???  I’m proud to say I kept my composure the entire time, but I felt like crying. I still sort of do. She gave me the number to her manager, and I sent him an email yesterday afternoon. He works on Monday, so I’m definitely going to stop in and see if there is ANYTHING they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. I travel a lot for work so I have a crap ton of Hilton honors points. Enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. I’m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.* My job definitely doesn’t cover that cost, and I most certainly don’t have that kind of dough. Not sure what I’m going to do. If anyone has any suggestions I’d be grateful for help. Unless I’m completely fucked.... 

Tl;dr - i thought guest laundry was complimentary. It is, in fact, not. Got a $300 bill when I could’ve just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry.

"TIFU by knocking a mirror off a car on my way to work on my motorcycle and now i can't ride my motorcycle to work.


So this happened last week. I ride my motorcycle to work (it's a sports bike for reference) whenever the weather is nice enough to do so. I take the highway to work and in the mornings, traffic can be pretty crazy. People really aren't paying attention especially to motorcycles so i have to be extra alert watching out for people changing lanes without blinkers or checking their mirrors. 

I was riding down the highway going about 70 mph in the fast lane and this black Lexus begins to enter my lane without paying attention, the driver doesn't see me. I quickly hit the horn and i can see he is on his phone texting he keeps coming over almost running me off the side of the road and there is a car in front of me so i can't accelerate out. I hit the brakes and allow this asshole over so he doesn't kill me then switch lanes, pissed off and i accelerate past him and punch his passenger mirror off as i pass and get the fuck out of there weaving my way through traffic.

I will say that when i ride, i use all my gear. Gloves, jacket, helmet and i have a black visor. You can't see what i look like at all. I get to work and i park my bike in the back lot away from everything and walk around to the front of the building to get inside. I go to my office and put my gear into a locker i have in there and bullshit around on reddit for a little bit. I get an email from my boss (who is retiring) to come see him in his office. I walk in and the dude who i knocked the mirror off is standing there. I know it's him, i saw his face when he tried to run me over. Oh shit. I'm thinking, how did this guy find me? I was way ahead of him and there's no way he could have caught up to me enough to follow me here. 

My boss introduces me to this guy 'Jim' he's my new boss...he doesn't recognize me because i was geared up on the bike. I spent the whole day worrying he'd see my red motorcycle in the back lot or him telling my boss what happened and my boss mentioning that i have a bike. But nothing happens. I nonchalantly stroll through the front lot smoking a cigarette to find his car to make sure that this was the guy. Low and behold his car is there, with one lonely mirror. I stayed late that day and waited for him to leave just to make sure he doesn't accidentally see me ride off and recognize my motorcycle/gear. It's been a week but I'm still paranoid he might find out somehow. I still can't believe the odds of this happening. 

Now i can't ride my motorcycle to work any longer in fear that my new boss will realize that i was the one who knocked his car mirror off his car even though i believe he deserved it.

TL;DR i knocked my new bosses mirror off of his Lexus while riding my motorcycle before i knew he was my new boss but he doesn't know it was me. "
"TIFU by wearing a hat to a viewing


Obligatory this didn't happen today but happened earlier in the week.
Recently the son of a family friend committed suicide (gunshot). It was unexpected for those of us who did not know he struggled with depression. The obituary said to dress casually, so I had come home from work for the day, got around and dressed, and left the house, grabbing the hat I always wear.
Once I got to the funeral home, there was quite a line. I stood and waited in line to see the family and to pay my final respects.
I had gotten looks from a few different people but at viewings people are normally fairly shook up and distraught so I thought nothing of it.
Once I got home, I realized my mistake when I took off my hat. The hat I always wear. Smith &amp; Wesson branded logo.
I feel like such an asshole. It was completely unintentional but man do I feel like such a jerk  :(
Rest easy up there bud.

TL;DR wore a Smith &amp; Wesson branded hat to the viewing of a man who committed suicide by gunshot."
"TIFU by spending $4000 On a wet hole


Like most FUs, this one didn’t happen today.  It was, however, discovered today.

I was at work and received a call: 

Water lady: “Hello, this is your water company and we just wanted to let you know that your meter reading is unusually high this month.”  

Me: “Like how high?”  

Water lady: “”Are you sitting down?”

Me: “Uh...should I be?”

Water lady: “I recommend it.”

Me: “I’m seated now.”

Water lady: “You’ve used 151,000 gallons.”

Me: “That is a lot; what is the bill on that?”

Water lady: “Still seated?”

Me: “Yeah.”

Water lady: “Just over $4000”

You see, I live in Bermuda, and there is no fresh water, so we catch fresh water from the sky into a tank and use it as drinking water.  Sometimes the rain is not enough, but if you are lucky enough to be in the service area, you can get hooked up to a service provider who, for $30/month, will pump RO water to your home.  The $30 includes 1000 gallons of water.  It is a life-saver at times.  I’m one of the lucky ones, I guess.

Now I also have a small pool, about 4000 gallons.  My pool has an automatic top-off to replenish the pool level when evaporation or ~~those goddamned kids~~ other causes remove water from the pool.  The top-off is controlled by a ball-cock in a reservoir tank.  Being the end of August, and a bit of a dry spell, the reservoir tank was empty and the intakes were sucking air, meaning it needed to be topped up.  The reservoir also happens to be connected to the service provider.  While I usually keep the shut-off valve closed, to avoid using the service provider water unnecessarily, I decided topping up the pool would be a good use of my free 1000 gallons, so I opened the shut off valve.

Now what is supposed to happen, is the water level in the reservoir will rise until the float on a ball-cock rises and shuts off the water flow.  This ball-cock is what makes the top off automated.  In this case, however, the lever connecting the ball-cock float to the valve snapped and the float just rose to the top of the tank.  If the tank overfills, like after a heavy rain, there is an outlet for the extra water, which simply flows into a hole in the ground.  With the valve broken and the service provider shut off open, the water free flowed for close to a month, through the overflow opening, and 151,000 gallons of RO water leaked into the ground.  Being porous limestone, the water just disappeared, completely undetected.

TL;DR I dumped 151,000 gallons of water into a hole in the ground and it cost me $4000"
"TIFU by pissing myself


The day started off relatively normal. I’m a high schooler and I was at my school and I felt pretty sick, so I told my parents. Then, shit goes fucking nuts. 

So I’m waiting at the office for the dean to show up and grant me a pass. I’m waiting for about an hour and no response. I’m about to just leave anyways when I learn the dean wasn’t here today. Another dean comes and asks me what I need. I tell him, and he asks me to call my mom. I do and she confirms everything. I get the pass. 

I’m waiting for the bus so I can go home. Both my parents are at work. I have to wait 20 minutes for the bus. When it finally comes, I jump on. Halfway through the hour long ride I think to myself, huh, I kinda have to take a piss. Whatever, it’ll probably be enough time to get home and then use the bathroom. Big mistake. 


By the time the bus stops, I’m struggling to contain the piss. My home is a 15 minute walk from the stop, so I part walk part run. I contemplate stopping at a restaurant to see if I can use the bathroom. I think to myself that it’s fine, I can probably make it. I also don’t want to interact with others as I am fairly antisocial. When I reach my house, I’m fumbling to get my keys out. I unlock the door and run up the god forsaken stairs. Seriously, why is the bathroom on the second floor? I’m about to make it when I feel the piss coming out. I’m literally *in the fucking bathroom* when the shit starts to flow from me. I’m just sitting there with a tear in my eye thinking “fuck me.”

TLDR: I felt sick, so I went home early without using the restroom at school, ended up posing myself in front of the toilet. "
"TIFU by sending a federal judge a story I wrote about how great Hitler is.


I am a law student. I'm currently applying to work with federal judges. It's a long process, and I've sent in hundreds of applications. I was sending out applications last night when I was way too tired and low on sleep to do it. 

I am recently out of undergraduate (K-JD for life). I use the same format for all documents I send out, which is ""James, John, Document name."" When I was in undergraduate, I wrote a creative story from the point of view of a Nazi working in a concentration camp. The story talked about Hitler's greatness, about the ""glorious extinction"" of the ""rat Jews,"" et cetera. I won't tell you I'm original. The teacher liked it, that's all that counts. I called this document ""James, John, Teacher Smith.""

Last night, I applied to another clerkship. This judge...can you see this coming?...has the same last name as the teacher I wrote the Hitler paper for. I wrote out a cover letter which I entitled ""Last Name First Name, Judge Smith."" I uploaded my ""cover letter"" and thought, in a brilliant move, ""AH, it's fine. It's perfect. No need to double check the whole thing!"" And I submitted it.

I logged in this morning to check if my recommendations had been submitted, and decided to review the application. I instantly realized that I submitted my Hitler story instead of my cover letter. You know, for the federal judge to read. I replaced it but I'm sure the judge will be able to see the change. So much for working there. It's not like this judge lives in my home state and I see her at alumni events, or anything. 

tl;dr: Submitted a ""cover letter"" about how great Hitler is for a job with a federal judge. Unless I stumbled upon the Hitler supporter on the bench, I probably won't get that job, or possibly any other. "
"TIFU by smoking weed at 5 in the morning


So it's about five in the morning, i'm at my mothers house after having been awake all night, needed to get to sleep, but I was excited to finish off the last of my weed before I take a break from it all when I drive to South America from CT. So my room is on the bottom floor and the joint is rolled. I open the sliding glass door and, as expected, the alarm goes off. Immediately I put the code in and hit star and off it goes. A minute later I hear the house phone ring, but it was AT&amp;T so I ignored it.

I go outside and, half behind the bushes and half in view of like 20 houses in the same complex as me, I smoke for a good 10-15 minutes. Then I come inside and as that high is kicking in I decide, before I run out and grab two double donuts, let me rub one out real quick. So I bring up the appropriate programming, get myself worked up in a few minutes and as I'm just getting into it and the high kicks in, red and blue lights suddenly flash through all my windows. With my pants all the way down I run to the window and can see a few men approaching the door through the curtains. So at this point I was very very high and very very veryyy paranoid and scared shitless. They rang the doorbell and I ran back into my room like Henry hill, I closed all the ""programming"" I took my last quarter of joint and lighter and contemplated flushing them even though the bathroom was on the top floor. Instead I put it in my old Xbox 360. Then I pause for a minute and thought about just pretending to have been asleep the whole time and hope they go away... then I realized how idiotic that was so, probably smelling like California in April, I answer the door and there were 8 men, paramedics, firefighters and police standing there. I let them in and they said the medical alert system was set off. I ran to wake my mother up, who sleeps naked, but was luckily spared anything extra, and as she was getting changed I went down to apologize. Eventually they all left, I felt horrible because apparently when I deactivated the alarm I hit the medical emergency button instead of the star... So yeah that was today and I fucking fucked up and now have to pay a bill for their services.

TL;DR - Went outside to smoke weed, set off house alarm, deactivate it, smoked, came inside, was trying to jerk the carrot when the paramedics/police showed up. Answered door to 8 grown men, including a firefighter, while smelling like weed and high as balls, woke up sleeping mother at 5 in the morning, found out I hit medical alert button by accident, now have to pay a bill for their services... dumb dumb dumb"
"TIFU by trash talking the course I'm taking


This actually happened today, go figure.

So I'm your run of the mill university student: perpetually tired, hungry, and groggy from having morning classes. I'm taking this class about ""Innovation in the Workplace"" (complete BS) because I wanted to have a bird course this semester, but as we all know: there is no such thing as a free ride. Now, this class has mandatory attendance \_and\_ participation, which means I need to show up to each three hour lecture and force myself to look up from my laptop every once in a while to pull an answer from my ass when called out by the prof. This usually isn't an issue, since the prof is usually doing the same, but at the same time, our mark completely depends on the prof's impression of us, since he is the only teaching staff for the course.

Now, this is a pretty small class (around 30 or so students), which is important because the prof knows all of us by face, if not by name. I've been pretty active in the class, answering questions, participating in discussion, etc, so the prof knows my voice by now. 

So halfway through the lecture, the prof called a 20 minute washroom break; at first this seemed a little suspicious since the breaks called are usually 10 minutes long. I wasn't complaining though, this was just more free time to slack off right?

After finishing up what I'm working on, I take the opportunity to go to the relatively empty bathroom and answer nature's call. Everything's great, feeling relieved. As I'm washing my hands, my friend shows up too, we start shooting the shit. I start shit talking the course to let off some steam; we're talking unorganized material, BS curriculum, prof's unclear delivery, you name it. At this point my friend cuts me off, points to the stall and I see a pair of black and white shoes that might be our prof's. We both freeze, and my flight response kicks in and I book it outside faster than a student loses motivation.

I get back to the classroom, and at this point I'm trying to come up with reasons as to why that wasn't my prof in the stall just now. Class started back up and lo-and-behold, the black and white shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

To add insult to injury, the slide right after the break was about team morale in an innovative workplace, with bullets like ""you should not insult team members"" and ""you need to make everyone feel welcome"". And of course the prof read those off the slide.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Shit talked the prof in the bathroom, can't speak in the course anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
